Created in 1993, following the tragic death of a three-year-old child whose family had a history of involvement with the Department, the Office of the Inspector Ge neral is committed to reforming and strengthening the child welfare s ystem through independent, com prehensive investigations. Through the vision and wisdom of the first Inspector General, who served in the role for over 25 years, the Office was founded upon a multi-disciplinary, collaborative approach to in vestigations in which integrity and independence are paramount. I am honored to have been appointed this past June to serve as the Acting Inspector General of the Illinois Department of Children and Fa mily Services. Throughout my 27 years with the Office in the roles of investigator, supervising attor ney, and chief legal counsel, I have been committed to the mission of this Office. During this transition of leadership and moving forward, this Office will continue to hold the Department, as well as individual emp loyees, supervisors, administrators, and contractors, accountable for sys temic deficiencies and instance s of misconduct. This year, the OIG identified a systemic pattern of child prote ction investigations in which there were significant delays in making initial contact with alleged child victims of abuse or neglect. In these cases, the Department failed to fulfill an essential responsibility in protecting children. (See Death and Serious Injury Investigation 13 and the full report in Appendix A.) Add itionally, several investigations conducted this year highlight the critical need for communication and col laboration among multiple entities. The Department, while charged with protecting children, cannot alon e ensure the well-being of our most vulnerable children and families . (See Death and Serious Injury Investigations 1 and 10.) Pursuant to Illinois administrative rules, in FY 2022, the Offi ce of the Inspector General conducted an investigatory review of prior Department involvement in 171 chi ld death cases. (See Child Death Report, p. 45.) Each and every one of th ese child deaths is heartbreaki ng, and the circumstances surrounding some are tragic and even horrific. When considering the number of ca ses reviewed by the OIG, it is critical to note that a review of the Department's prior involvement with t he deceased child's family does not necessarily indicate wrongdoing or failures on the part of the Department or the child's parents. Rather, these investigations are an oppor tunity for a thorough case exa mination to identify practice errors and missed opportunities for intervention on behalf of children and families. The investigatory review aims to inform recommendations to improve child welfare practice. Our O ffice is founded upon a fundamental belief that the life of each child is a story that deserves to be told. As public servants, we must learn from their stories. As we enter 2023, it is with solemn reflection that we pause to remember the tragic death one year ago of Deidre Silas, a child protection investigator murdered while re sponding to a call of child endangerment in a home. We also remember child protection investigator Pamela K night, who died in 2017 following a brutal beating while attempting to remove an endangered child f rom his father. The Department and all ` government leaders have a duty to support and protect front-lin e child welfare workers who are dedicated to ensuring the safety of child ren and providing services to fa milies. I am grateful to the Governor for the opportunity to serve as t he Acting Inspector General of the Department of Children and Family Services and it is with heartfelt apprec iation that I recognize my team for their unwavering commitment to the mission of this Office and the chi ldren and families of Illinois.

B-1 ` 1 INTRODUCTION The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS or the Department) was created by a unanimous vote of the Illinois General Assembly in June 1993 to reform and strengthen the child welfare system. The mandate of the OIG is to investigate misconduct, misfeasance, malfeasance, and violations of rules, procedures, or laws by DCFS employees, foster parents, service providers and contractors with the Department (20 ILCS 505/35.5 - 35.7). To that end, OIG conducts inves tigations and makes recommendations to prot ect children, uncover wrongdoing, improve practice, and increase professionalism within the Department. The OIG is a small office in relation to the broader child welfare system. Rather than address problems in isolation, OIG views its role as strengthening the ability of the Department and private agencies to perform their duties. INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS The OIG's investigative process begins with a Request for Investigation, notification by the State Central Register of a child's death or serious injury, or a referral for a Child Welfare Employee License investigation. In FY 2022, OIG reviewed 709 Requests for Investigation and conducted 7,239 searches for criminal background information. Requests for Investigation and notices of deaths or serious injuries are screened to determine whether the facts alleged suggest possible misconduct by a Department employee, private agency employee, foster parent, service provider, or identify a need for systemic change. If an allegation is accepted for investigation, OIG will conduct a full investigation pursuant to 89 Ill. Admin. Code 430. The Inspector General reports to the Director of the Department and to the Governor with recommendations for discipline, systemic change, or sanctions against private agencies. OIG monitors the implementation of accepted recommendations. OIG may refer complaints to law enforcement, if criminal acts appear to have been committed; to the Department's Advocacy Office for Children and Families; or to other state regulatory agencies, such as the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, when appropriate. ADMINISTRATIVE RULES Rules of the Office of the Inspector General are published in the Illinois Register at 89 Ill. Admin. Code 430. The Rules govern intake and investigations of complaints from the general public, child deaths or serious injuries, and allegations of misconduct. Rules pertaining to employee licensure action are found at 89 Ill. Admin. Code 412. CONFIDENTIALITY A complainant to the OIG, or anyone providing information, may request that their identity be kept confidential. To protect the confidentiality of the complainant, OIG will attempt to procure evidence through other means, whenever possible. At the same time, an accused employee needs to have sufficient information to enable that employee to present a defense. OIG and the Department are mandated to ensure that no one will be retaliated agains t for making a good-faith complaint or providing information in good faith to OIG. Reports issued by OIG contain information that is confidential pursuant to both state and federal laws. As such, OIG reports are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act. Annually, OIG 2prepares several reports redacting confidential information for use as t eaching tools for private agency and Department employees. Redacted reports are also shared with other entities that interact with, or are involved in, the child welfare system. IMPOUNDING OIG is charged with investigating misconduct \"in a manner designed to ensure the preservation of evidence for possible use in a criminal prosecution\" (20 ILCS 505/35.5(b)). In order to conduct thorough investigations, while ensuring the integrity of records, OIG investigators may impound files by immediately securing and retrieving original records. INVESTIGATION CATEGORIES DEATH AND SERIOUS INJURY INVESTIGATIONS According to DCFS Rule 430, the Inspector General investigates deaths or serious injuries in foster homes, child welfare institutions, independent living progr ams and other facilities licensed by the Department, as well as deaths or serious injuries when there was an open child welfare service case or child protection investigation by the Department within the preceding 12 months. The Inspector General is an ex officio member of the Child Death Review Team Executive Council. When the Illinois State Central Register (SCR) receives a report of child death or serious injury, a Critical Event Report is generated. OIG reviews the Critical Event Report and other computer databases to determine whether the death or serious injury meets the OIG criteria for case opening. OIG opens a case for a child death or serious injury when the family has had prior involvement with the Department, or its contracted agencies, within one year of the death or serious injury. When further investigation is warranted, records are impounded, subpoenaed, or requested, and a review is completed. When necessary, a full investigation, including interviews, is conducted. OIG created and maintains a database of child death statistics and critical information related to child deaths in Illinois. The following chart summarizes the death cases reviewed in FY 2022: FY 2022 CHILD DEATH CASES REVIEWED INVESTIGATORY REVIEWS OF RECORDS 134 FULL INVESTIGATIONS * 37 CHILD DEATHS IN FY 2022 MEETING OIG CRITERIA FOR REVIEW 171 * 13 deaths were included in a systemic issue report Summaries of death investigations where a full investigative report was submitted to the DCFS Director in FY 2022 are included in the Investigations Section of this Report. Later in the same section, there are summaries of all child deaths reviewed by OIG in FY 2022. GENERAL INVESTIGATIONS OIG responds to and investigates complaints filed by the state and local judiciary, Department and private agency employees, foster parents, biological parents, and the general public. Investigations yield both case-specific recommendations, including disciplinary recommendations, and recommendations for systemic changes within the child welfare system. CHILD WELFARE EMPLOYEE LICENSURE (CWEL) INVESTIGATIONS In 2000, the General Assembly mandated that the Department institute a system for licensing direct service child welfare employees. The CWEL system permits centralized credentialing and monitoring of all persons providing direct child welfare services, whether employed with the Department or a private agency. The employee licensing system seeks to maintain accountability, integrity, and honesty of those entrusted with the care of vulnerable children and families. 3 A CWEL is required for Department and private agency investigative, child welfare, and licensing workers and supervisors. The Department, through the Office of Employee Licensure, administers and issues CWELs. A committee composed of representatives of OIG, the CWEL Board and the Department's Office of Employee Licensure screens referrals for CWEL investigations. The committee reviews complaints to determine whether the allegations meet one or more grounds for licensure action as defined in Department Ru le 412.50 (89 Ill. Adm. Code 412.50). OIG investigates and prosecutes CWEL complaints. When a CWEL investigation is completed, OIG, as the Department's representative, determines whether the findings of the investigation support possible licensure action. Such allegations that could support licensure action include conviction for specified criminal acts, indicated findings of child abuse or neglect, or egregious acts that demonstrate incompetence or a pattern of deviation from a minimum standard of child welfare practice. Department Rule 412.50 (89 Ill. Adm. Code 412.50) specifies the grounds for licensure action. When licensure action is appropriate, the licensee is provided an opportunity for a hearing. An Administrative Law Judge presides over the hearing and reports findings and recommendations to the CWEL Board. The CWEL Board makes the final decision regarding licensure action. In FY 2022, 41 cases were referred for CWEL investigations. FY 2022 CWEL INVESTIGATION DISPOSITIONS PENDING INVESTIGATION 12 LICENSE RELINQUISHED 8 MONITORED CHILD PROTECTION INVESTIGATION OF LICENSEE 18 CLOSED 3 FY 2022 CWEL INVESTIGATION REFERRALS RECEIVED 41 CRIMINAL BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION AND LAW ENFORCEMENT LIAISON The Department is required by statute to assess the relevant criminal history of caretakers prior to the placement of children and to accomplish its other statutory duties (20 ILCS 505/5(v)). Because OIG meets the definition of a criminal justice agency in the Department of Justice Regulations on Criminal Justice Information Systems (Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20, Subpart A) OIG, unlike the Department, has access to criminal history outside of Illinois within limits set by the National Crime Prevention and Privacy Act. The Law Enforcement Agencies Data System (LEADS), as dictated by state and federal law, cannot be used to conduct background checks for employment or licensing purposes. The Illinois Administrative Code forbids use of the LEADS network and LEADS data for personal purposes. OIG provides technical assistance to the Department and private agencies in performing and assessing out of state criminal history inquiries for the purpose of child safety in emergency placement. OIG answers case requests for criminal background information from LEADS. Each case may involve multiple law enforcement database searches and may involve requests on multiple persons. Though LEADS results may be used immediately, fingerprint checks are required for confirmation. In addition to child protection investigator and caseworker requests, when the Placement Clearance Desk is considering a non-licensed home for placement and the Illinois LEADS contains an arrest which may pose a safety threat to a child, but does not include disposition information, OIG provides technical assistance in obtaining the disposition. The Placement Clearance Desk may also request an out-of-state LEADS check for approving a home for immediate placement of children. In FY 2022, OIG's six LEADS operators conducted 7,239 searches for criminal background information. 4The OIG serves as the primary liaison between the Department and the Illinois State Police. In the course of an investigation, if evidence indicates that a criminal act may have been committed, OIG may notify the Illinois State Police. OIG may also investigate the alleged act for administrative action only. OIG assists law enforcement agencies with investigations, as requested. If law enforcement elects to pursue a criminal investigation and requests that the administrative investigation be put on hold, OIG will retain the case on monitor status. If law enforcemen t declines to prosecute, OIG will determine whether further investigation or administrative action is appropriate. REFERRALS FROM THE OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE INSPECTOR GENERAL In FY 2022, OIG received 105 referrals for investigation from the Office of the Executive Inspector General (OEIG). After preliminary review, a referral may be closed, opened for further investigation, or transferred for further review by Department management, the Office of Affirmative Action, Labor Relations, or the Advocacy Office for Children and Families. Preliminary review is the initial review completed upon receipt from the OEIG. Referrals that are closed at the preliminary stage include referrals that do not meet OIG criteria for investigation, referrals with insufficient identifying information and referrals previously submitted by a different source and opened through general intake. The Office of the Inspector General closed 52 referrals at the preliminary stage, 46% of which closed because they did not meet criteria for investigation, and the remaining 54% of w hich closed because the allegations had been addressed in a prior complaint received throu gh general intake. The Office of the Inspector General returned seven referrals to the OEIG because of lack of jurisdiction. Investigatory reviews occur after the intake staff determine the referral meets the Office of the Inspector General criteria for investigation. An investigatory review includes obtaining and reviewing relevant case record information. Fifty-one investigations were closed at the investigatory review stage after it was determined no further action was warranted. Two OEIG referrals are pending full investigation. FY 2022 REFERRALS FROM OEIG PRELIMINARY REVIEW 52 INVESTIGATORY REVIEW 51 FULL INVESTIGATION PENDING 2 FY 2022 OEIG REFERRALS 105 REPORTS OIG reports are submitted to the Director of DCFS. Specific reports also are shared with the Governor. An OIG report contains a summary of the complaint, a historical perspective on the case, including a case history, and detailed information about prior DCFS or private agency contact(s) with the family. Reports also include an analysis of the findings, along with recommendations. OIG is mandated by statute to be separate from the operations of the Department. OIG files are not accessible to the Department. The investigations, investigative reports, and recommendations are prepa red without editorial input from either the Department or any private agency. Once a report is completed, OIG will consider comments received and may revise the report accordingly. OIG uses some reports as training tools to provide a venue for ethical discussion on individual and systemic problems in child welfare practice. The reports are redacted to ensure confidentiality and then distributed to the Department or private agencies as a resource for child welfare professionals. 5 RECOMMENDATIONS OIG may recommend systemic reform or case-specific interventions in the investigative reports. Systemic recommendations are designed to strengthen the child welfare system to better serve children and families. OIG presents recommendations for discipline to the Director of the Department and, if applicable, to the director and board of the involved private agency. Recommendations for discipline may be subject to due process requirements. Ideally, discipline should have an accountability component as well as a constructive or didactic one. It should educate an employee on matters related to their misconduc t while also functioning to hold employees responsible for their conduct. Without the accountability component, there is little to deter misconduct. Without the didactic component, an employee may conclude they have simply violated an arbitrary rule with no rationale behind it. In addition, OIG will determine whether the facts suggest a systemic problem or an isolated instance of misconduct or bad practice. If the facts suggest a systemic problem, OIG may investigate further to determine appropriate recommendations for systemic reform. When recommendations concern a private agency, appropriate sections of the report are submitted to the agency di rector and the board of directors of that agency. The agency may submit a response. In addition, the board and agency director are given an opportunity to meet with OIG to discuss the report and recommendations. OIG may also work directly with a private agency and its board of directors to ensure implementation when recommendations pertain to a private agency. In rare circumstances, when the allegations are serious enough to present a risk to children, OIG may request that an agency's intake for new cases be put on temporary hold, or that an employee be placed on desk duty pending the outcome of the investigation. OIG monitors implementation of recommendations made to the Director of DCFS and private agencies. Monitoring may take several forms. OIG will monitor to ensure that Department or private agency staff implement the recommendations made. OIG may consult with the Department or private agency to assist in the implementation process. OIG may also develop accepted reform initiatives for future integration into the Department. OIG HOTLINE Pursuant to statute, OIG operates a statewide, toll-free telephone number for public access. Foster parents, guardians ad litem , judges, and others involved in the child welfare system have called the OIG Hotline to request assistance in addressing the following concerns: Complaints regarding DCFS caseworkers and/or supervisors ranging from breaches of confidentiality to failure of duty Complaints about private agencies or contractors Child Abuse Hotline information Child support information Foster parent board payments Youth in College Fund payments Problems accessing medical cards Licensing questions Ethics questions General questions about DCFS and OIG The OIG Hotline is an effective tool that enables OIG to communicate with concerned persons, respond to the needs of Illinois children, and address day-to-day problems related to the delivery of child welfare services. The following chart summarizes OIG's response to calls received in FY 2022.

PART I: DEATH AND SERIOUS INJURY INVESTIGATIONS DEATH AND SERIOUS INJURY INVESTIGATION 1 A 20yearold mother placed her 2monthold infant, her second child, to sleep in a baby swing. Approximately six hours later, she found the infant unresponsive and limp. The autopsy noted the infant had a .021 blood alcohol con tent, insect bites, dirty hands and feet, a blistering diaper rash, and general signs of neglect. The cause of death was ruled sudden unexplained infant death with unsafe sleep features. The manner was undetermined. A pediatric abuse/neglect specialist noted the infant had a petechial marking indicative of asphyxiation, and opined that all the circumstances of neglect, in addition to the unsafe sleep position, caused the death. The pa rents were indicated for death by neglect of the infant and cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries t o the sibling. The Department also indicated the parents for environmental neglect and substantial risk of physi cal injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Four months prior to the infant's death, th e family's intact family services case had been closed. The Department first investigated the family the Child Abuse Ho tline (the Hotline) received a report that the infant's then 16yearold father liv ed with the then 19yearold mother, who had given birth to her oldest child, th e infant's sibling, the prior month. The mother and father confirmed their relationship to the child protection investigator, stating they had been dating for a year and had been living together for at least the last two mon ths with the mother's grandmother. The Department indicated the mother for sexual penetration against the father, and the child p rotection investigator advised the couple they could not live together because of thei r ages. While the first child protection investigation was pending, the Department initiated a second investigation after a nurse reported that a babysitter brought the then 1monthold sibling to the hospital as he had difficulty breathing, and no one was able to reach the mother. The nurse s tated the mother had previously brought the 1monthold sibling to the hospital, and the sibling was diagno sed with croup, an infection of the upper airway that obstructs breathing and causes coughing. The parents were instructed not to smoke around the sibling, as that would exacerbate the condition, but the babysitter disclos ed to the reporter that the home smelled of marijuana when she went to pick up the sibling. INVESTIGATION DEATH 8 The child protection investigator went to the hospital and hosp ital staff explained the sibling was discharged to the babysitter the night before with a prescription, but the ba bysitter brought the sibling back in the morning as the pharmacy would not fill the prescription without speaking t o the mother. Hospital staff also reported that one month earlier, the sibling was diagnosed with failure to th rive. The mother told the child protection investigator that she fell asleep at a friend's home and her ph one did not work. The babysitter confirmed that she initially brought the sibling to the hospital, where he was treated for croup and released with a prescription. The babysitter showed the child protection investigator the mul tiple text messages she sent to the mother and stated she also called the sibling's maternal great-grandmother , to no avail. The babysitte r added that the mother had a history of substance use. The parents agreed to cooperate with intact family services and agreed the child protection investigator could place the sibling with relatives as part of a safety plan. The child protection investigator had the parents submit to a toxicology screening, and they tested positive for cannabis. The child protection investigator ended the safety plan after five weeks, as the mother reported scheduling appointments with WIC and the pediatrician. The Department closed the invest igation and indicated the mother for medical neglect. During the second child protection investigation, the child pro tection investigator referred the family to high- risk intact family services, and the case was assigned to a pri vate agency. The child protection staff met with the intact worker and her superv isor to inform them of the sibl ing's diagnosis of failure to thrive and that he gained weight while residing with relatives during the safety p lan. The child protection investigator also advised she spoke to a counselor who cond ucted a mental health and subs tance use disorder evaluation with the mother prior to the child protection investigations. The counselor rep orted the mother functioned at the cognitive age of a 12yearold and did not understand the issues of having a sexual relationship with a minor or leaving the 1-month-old sibling with a friend. The child protection investi gator informed the intact worker that the mother may need a psychological evaluation to determine her parenting capacity, as she lacked basic parenting skills. The intact worker documented the family needed parenting and in fant care services, coordination of community-based services, and monitoring of the sibling's medic al issues. The child protection investigator and intact worker went to the great grandmother's residence to visit the family, and upon arrival, they both noted the home strongly smelled of marijuana. The parents state d they smoked marijuana an hour prior to the visit, and the parents were informed that s moking marijuana was illegal since they wer e under 21. The worker referred the parents to substance use disorder services and men tal health counseling with the goal of having them assessed for mental health, parenting capac ity, and substa nce use. The intact work er made two additional weekly visits to the home and no ted she observed the sibling an d that the home did not smell of marijuana. Less than a month after the intact family services case opened, the Hotline received an anonymous report that the parents were smoking marijuan a while the then 4monthold s ibling was in the room. It was also reported that the parents placed the sibling in a bouncy seat, propped u p a bottle, left him outside their bedroom while they slept. The reporter alleged the police were frequently cal led to the home for verbal altercations, but since the father was a minor, the police would send him to stay with his father for a few days. The reporter added the parents screamed at each other while the sibling was present, a nd it was believed the father was violent with the mother. A child protection in vestigator interviewed two mat ernal relatives, who reported they witnessed the unattended sibling crying in his bouncy seat. A relative added she saw the father beat the mother after the couple used drugs in the sibling's presence. The child protection inve stigator spoke to the parents, who admitted to daily marijuana use but did not believe smoking in the sibling' s presence could harm him. The child protection investigator noted the sibling looked healthy and provided the parents with safe sleep education and appropriate bedding. Throughout the third child prot ection investigation, the intact worker conducted visits with the f amily, and the parents reported participati ng in counseling sessions. The ment al health provider told the worker the parents had not attended any sessions. Th e parents also failed to atten d their first three toxicology screenings and then tested positive for cannabis in subsequent tests. Less than two weeks after the initiation of the child protection 9 investigation, the parents moved from the great grandmother's h ome into their own apartment. During this time, the intact worker documented cons istently observing drug paraph ernalia and marijuana in plain view, and at times, there was visible smoke in the air while the sibling was present. The intact worker discussed with the parents the hazards of smoking marijuana around the sibling, bu t the mother argued he was fine, and she had smoked marijuana throughout her pregnancy. Later in the intact family services case, the worker noted the father presented with cognitive de lays. The father reported a h istory of serious mental h ealth issues but did not take medication and self-medicated with marijuana, which he sta ted allowed him to control his emotions. The mother also told the intact worker she was previously diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and she also self- medicated with marijuana but denied using other drugs. Less than a week before the third child protection investigatio n was closed, a relative told the intact worker that the mother slipped an unknown pill in the 5monthold's formula to help with teething. The mother said it was a dissolvable teething pill, but she did not recall the medicat ion's name and could not show the worker the pills. The worker spoke to the child protection investigator and super visor about the unknown pill and the concerns regarding the continued exposur e to secondhand marijuana smoke. After the discussion, the worker scheduled a toxicology screening with the sibling's doctor for his next w ellness visit. The next day, the child protection investigator submitted a request to petition for protective cus tody to the assistant state's attorney (ASA), outlining the risks and parents' lack of cooperation with intac t family services. The child protection investigator noted the ASA determined there was not enough information to ta ke protective custody, but that the ASA would file a neglect petition for cour t intervention. Three days late r, the child protection supe rvisor notified the intact worker and her supervisor of the investigation's closure and in structed them to call the Hotline if the sibling tested positive for drugs. The worker was also instructed to co ntact the police about the parents' underage marijuana use and the visible paraphernalia during visits. The worker told OIG investigators that she contacted the police, but the police did not consider the report serious because it only involved marijuana. The Department closed the child protection inv estigation and indicated the par ents for inadequate superv ision and substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and wel fare by neglect. The ASA had not filed a petition for court intervention by the time the child protection investi gation closed. The sibling's doctor made multiple attempts with the mother to schedule the next wellness visit, which took over a month to coordinate. The mother ultimately canceled the sibling's wellness visit and did not reschedule. The intact worker contacted the child protection investigator, reporting in the six weeks since the third investigation closed, the parents missed the sibling's wellness visit that included the toxicology screening, refused their own toxicology scr eenings, were not participating in services, and the mother was approximately two to three months pregnant and concealing her pregnancy. The worker stated she had not heard from the ASA regarding the petition, even though she had contacted him twice . The child protection investigator recommended the worker update the petition request to add these concerns and continue reaching out to the ASA. The child protection investigator also advised if the work er felt during a visit that the sibling was not safe, the worker should call the Hotline or police. Two weeks l ater, the mother took the then 7monthold sibling to the wellness visit, but the medical staff told the worker th at the mother became irate when it came time for the sibling's toxicology screening. The mother left before the test could be completed. The incident was reported to the Hotline but did not meet criteria to open an in vestigation. The parents became less cooperative with the worker. One month later, the intact worker staffed the case with her supervisor and administrator. The supervisor instructed the worker to follow up with the mother's doctor about her prenatal care and the ASA. The mother's doctor told the worker that she tested positive fo r marijuana and the doctor cautioned her about using marijuana while pregnant, advising it may cause growth re striction, which had been an issue with her first child, the sibling. The parents began to avoid the intact worker, so the worker conducted unannounced visits for the following month. The home did not smell of marij uana when the worker was able to see the family. Before speaking with the supervisor and administrator, the inta ct worker updated the request to petition for court intervention to include the worker's increasing concerns and the worker's attempts to contact the ASA on two occasions. The intac t supervisor notified Department staff of the concerns regarding the family, which were 10 forwarded to the DCFS Supervis ory Regional Counsel, who suggest ed the intact staff send a new request, along with the previous request, note that the child protection inves tigator spoke with the ASA, and include the updates since the last child protection investigation closed. T he intact worker incorporated these recommendations and contacted the ASA three more times. Seven months after the family's intact services case was opened , the case was closed uns uccessfully due to the parents' lack of compliance. Intact family services are volunta ry unless there is a court order. The worker told OIG investigators that she still had concerns, but whenever she went to the home, the sibling appeared happy and healthy, and the parents followed safe sleep practices. In the five months after the Department closed the third child protection investigation, the worker documented sev en attempts to contact the ASA, requesting to discuss the case and petition, but the ASA did not respond nor file the petition. The worker told OIG investigators that she also called the ASA's office, left messa ges, and went to the ASA's office at one point. OIG investigators interviewed the ASA, who reported little reco llection of the case, excep t believing it did not rise to the level of filing a petition. The ASA did not recall the extent of the family's issues and could not explain why he never responded to the worker's multiple petitio ns and attempts to staff the case. Three months after the intact family services case closed, the Department initiated a fourth child protection investigation when the mother gave birth to the infant, her sec ond child; the infant tested positive for marijuana; and the mother admitted to using marijuana daily during her pre gnancy. The next day, the child protection investigator spoke with the parents at their residence because the mother had signed he rself out of the hospital against medical advice. The child protection investigator noted no concerns about the 14monthold sibling and gave the parents a new pack-and- play. The child protection inve stigator also spoke with hospital staff, who stated they would discharge the infant later that day. Less tha n a week later, the Hotline received a report that the grandfather brought the inf ant to the hospital because the family's doctor said the in fant had a high level of THC in her system and needed to be seen in the emergency depart ment. The child protection investigator confirmed this with hospital st aff, who stated the doctor reque sted the welfare check after the infant's tests stated she had a THC level greater than 500 ng/ml. The Mayo Cli nic reports a THC level of 500 ng/ml or greater indicates chronic and recent marijuana use. The hospital staff noted the infant had no signs of cannabinoids intoxication and appeared well. The parents denied smoking mari juana in front of the children and declined intact family services. The child protection investigator spoke with the ASA, reporting three indicated child protection investigations in the last 15 months and explained t he current concerns, but added she saw the children earlier that day, and the parents appeared to meet the minimal parenting standards. The ASA stated he would not file a petition because marijuana was legal. The Depa rtment closed the investigation and indicated the mother for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Four days later, it was reported to the Hotline that the mother missed three appointments for the infant's immunizations. The reporter adde d the grandmother disclosed tha t the parents smoked marijuana and cigarettes around the baby. The call was not taken for investigation. Less than two weeks later, the infant was pronounced deceased. The intact worker consistently followed up with the ASA, detail ing the risks to a young child and the parents' refusal to participate in services, but the ASA did not respond . The ASA's reasoning for not filing during the fourth child protection investigation was because marijuana was legal. This case highlights the importance of ensuring that court personnel understand and recognize the risk presented to children when parents fail to cooperate with services, including unaddressed mental health is sues, developmental delays, and continued substance use. The intact staff sought help from the Department , but DCFS Office of Legal Services staff directed the intact worker back to the state's attorney and did not provide direct assistance. 1. This report should be shared with DCFS Office of Legal Servi ces. RECOMMENDATIONS 11 The Department agrees. The repor t was shared with DCFS Office o f Legal Services. 2. The OIG reiterates its recomm endation from prior report, 201 8 IG 1487: DCFS Office of Legal Services should meet with their lo cal State's Attorneys at leas t annually to discuss the use of protective orders in cases that do not rise to urgent and immediate necess ity. The Department agrees. In Decemb er 2021, the Deputy General Cou nsel, in conjunction with staff from the Administrative Office of Illinois Courts (AOIC), presented a tr aining to judges and other court stakeholders on the use of protective orders.

DEATH AND SERIOUS INJURY INVESTIGATION 2 A child born with fatal congen ital conditions died a day after birth. The autopsy determined the cause of death as cardiovascular collapse skelet al dysplasia, and the manner of death as natural. The Department did not investigate the newborn's death for abuse or neglect. There were two unfounded child protection investigations in the year prior to the newborn's death involving the newborn's mother and siblings. Nine months prior to the newborn's death, the mother was involv ed in two unfounded child protection investigations. The Department first investigated the mother after the Hotline received a report that the mother phys ically abused the newborn's then 12yearold half-sibling. The 12yearold's father reported the abuse to th e police. The father explained he lived out of state and the mother had guardianship of the 12yearold, but the sib ling had lived with fictive kin for most of her life and would only occasionally sta y with her mother. The fict ive kin reported to the police that the mother was no longer allowing the 12yearold to stay with the fictive kin and that the sibling sent text messages stating the mother punched her and hit he r with a belt. The father and fictive kin urged the police to take protective DEATH INVESTIGATION 12 custody, but the officer stated they could onl y intervene if th ey observed the child with serious injuries, which no one had yet observed. A child protection investigator went to the home and met with t he 12yearold, who was watching her 9yearold and 7yearold half-siblings while her mother was out. The chil d protection investigator spoke briefly to the children at the front door, and the 12yearold stated she felt unsafe in her mother's home, and she wanted to leave because her mother hit and spanked her. The child protect ion investigator noted the 12yearold had a red mark on the side of her leg and on her arm but described them a s small and faint. The two other children reported they felt safe in the home. The 9yearold stated he was spanke d or had his electronics taken away as punishment, and the child protection investigator noted no inju ries were observed on the child. The mother returned home, told the children to go inside, slammed the door , and refused to speak with the child protection investigator. Law enforcement arrived at the home to assist the child protection investigator. The mother reluctantly spoke to the child protection investigator and repo rted she occasionally spanked her children to discipline them. She denied she punched the 12yearold but adm itted she spanked her w ith a belt. The mother refused to allow the child protec tion investigator or law enfor cement to come into the home but permitted the child protection investigator t o observe the 7yearold, who ha d no visible injuries. Two weeks later, the mother was unfounded for substantial risk of physical injury/environme nt injurious to health and welfare. The child protection staff noted the discipline did not rise to the level of abuse, and the allegations were the result of the parents' custody dispute. The child protection investigator tol d the father the Department could not intervene in custody issues but offered to provide him information on how to file a petition to the court for custody of the child. Less than three weeks later, anot her report was made to the Hot line alleging the mother physically abused the 12yearold while the child had a friend over. It was reported the friend left soon after the mother began hitting the child and then the police were called. A child protection i nvestigator contacted the friend's mother, who stated her child was panic-stricken and asked her to pick her u p from the 12yearold's home. The friend told the child protection investigator she was at the home when the mother slapped the 12yearold and then took her to another room, but the friend could hear her scream. The child protection investigat or contacted the police, and they reported they conducted a wellness check but did not o bserve any bruising and did not have any concerns. The child protection investigator went to the home, b ut the mother confronted him and was verbally aggressive. The 12yearold came to the front door, and when th e mother was distracted by calling her attorney, the child protection investigator asked the 12yearold if she felt safe in the home, and the child whispered she did not feel safe. After speaki ng to the attorney, the mother a llowed the child to step out onto the sidewalk to speak with the child protection investigator, but the mother in terfered and recorded the interview. The child protection investigator noted the child appeared very uncomfort able responding to the questions while the mother was listening and frequently interrupted. The child prot ection investigator asked the child again if she felt safe, but this time the child stated she felt safe in the home. The child protection investigator told OIG investigators that the child did not appear to be afraid or und er duress when she changed her answer, which was why she was not taken into protective custody. The child protec tion investigator also observed no bruising on the child. The mother did not a llow the child protection invest igator to interview the siblings or observe the inside of the home. The child protection investigator attempted another visit, but the mother stated the child protection investigator had to contact her attorney, who was also not cooperative. The child protection supervisor instructed the child protection investigator to send the attorney a subpoena and vis itation order through certified mail. After several phone calls to the attorney, the attorney eventually arranged f or the child protection investigator to observe the children but prohibited the children from being interviewed. Th e child protection investigator observed the two younger siblings outside the home, as the mother denied access to the residence, and noted the children appeared healthy, clean, and without visible injuries. The child protect ion investigator did not observe the 12yearold and did not arrange to see her. T he second child protection inv estigation was closed less than a month after the 13 allegations were reported, and th e Department unfounded the mot her for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare. Although the mother's attorney impeded the investigation, the c hild protection staff involved in the second investigation did not request assistance from the DCFS Office o f Legal Services to pursue a court order to interview the children or assist with communicating with the mo ther's attorney. DCFS procedures allow for child protection investigators to consult DCFS Office of Legal Services to pursue a court order if the adult caregiver prohibits the child protection investigator from obse rving or speaking with the children. 1. This report should be shared with the child protection inves tigator and supervisor involved in the second investigation for trainin g purposes. The Department agrees. The report will be shared with the invol ved child protection investigator and supervisor. 2. DCFS Office of Legal Services shall issue a written communic ation to child protection staff outlining the appropriate use of Regiona l Counsel as an available resourc e when parents and/or their attorneys are uncooperative. The Department agrees. The Division of Child Protection and Off ice of Legal Services developed guidance for the field related to this issue . The guidance has been shared w ith Regional and Area Administrators. 3. This report should be shared with the Simulation Labs to cre ate a training scenario addressing uncooperative parents and/or legal counsel during a child prote ction investigation. The Department agrees. The curre nt simulation scenarios involve interactions with uncooperative parents. The Department will highlight in Founda tions Training and regional legal in-service trainings the need for child protection staff to consult with DCFS Regional Counsel when chi ld protection staff encounter an uncooperative parent and/or uncooperative private legal counsel. DEATH AND SERIOUS INJURY INVESTIGATION 3 A 1yearold was attacked by th e family dog after she reached f or the dog's food bowl. Family members pried the dog off the child and called 911 . Emergency services transported the child to the hospital, where she was p ronounced deceased. At the time of the incident, the child and 6yearold maternal half-sibling lived with the m aternal grandmother. The Department initiated a safety plan to place the maternal half-sibling with his paterna l grandmother and subsequently indicated the maternal grandmother for death by neglect. There were three ind icated child protection investigations within the year prior to the child's death involving the child's mother , maternal grandmother, and siblings. The maternal grandmother had extensive history with the Departm ent, which included 29 child protection investigations, a failed intact fa mily services case resulting in a placement case, and four Hotline calls not taken for investigation. The placement case began in 2008 and closed in 2012, after the court returned guardianship of the four children to the grandmother. Two years later, in 2014, the child's maternal half-sibling was bor n to the grandmother's teen daughter. That year, the Department indicated the maternal grandmother for substanti al risk to three of her children and the maternal half-sibling due to domestic violence between the grandmother a nd her then-paramour. In 2015, the Department investigated and unfounded the grandmother for an investigation involving the maternal half-sibling and the RECOMMENDATIONS DEATH INVESTIGATION 14 child's mother. In 2016, the Department investigated the grandm other three times; two were unfounded and one investigation was indicated for cuts, bruises, welts, abras ions, and oral injuries to the grandmother's then 13yearold son. Later in 2016, t he grandmother obtained privat e guardianship of the th en 2yearold maternal sibling. The following year, the Department unfounded the grand mother for inadequate supervision of the maternal sibling. In 2018, the Department initiated an investigation after the th en 4yearold maternal sibling disclosed that his mother had hit him with a belt. Medical staff observed a bruise on the maternal sibling but did not know when the injury occurred. A child prot ection investigator interviewe d the sibling, who stated he lived with his mother and maternal grandmother, and he hurt himself when he fell from his bike. The Department unfounded the mother and maternal grandmother and assessed that the family di d not need services. Two years later, in 2020, the Department initiated an investiga tion after the mother and the child, then a newborn, tested positive for cocaine. The mother reported she u sed cocaine a week prior to the birth and had not received prenatal care. The child protection investigator m et with the mother and maternal grandmother at the hospital, and the mother sta ted she wanted to attend inpati ent substance use disorder treatment and planned to give the grandmother guardian ship of the child . The child pr otection investigator advi sed if the mo ther gave guardianship to the grandmother, the mother would be ineligible for intact services; however, if the mother maintained guardianship, the mot her could participate in servic es while the grandmother cared for the then newborn child. The mother agreed to not be alone with the child or remove the child from the grandmother's home, but the child protection investigator did not implement a safety plan. The mother agreed that if she did not complete treatment, she would give the grandmother guardian ship. Less than two weeks later, the grandmother requested guardians hip paperwork from the child pro tection investigator because the mother had not entered treatment, due to th e pandemic, and had left the ho me. Before closing the investigation, the child protection investig ator received police record s involving the family, which included a warrant executed at the maternal grandmother's previous residence a month before the child's birth. The child protection supervisor approved the child prote ction investigator's assessment that the child was safe with the grandmother and to allow her to seek guardianship of the child. The supervisor told OIG investigators that he was familiar with the family's history bu t explained the maternal grandmother was last indicated in 2016 for cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries to her then 13yearold son. The Department indicated the mother for substance misuse by neglect and closed the investigation. In her OIG interview, the child protection investigator stated she did not offer intact family services because the grandmother did not require services. Months later, the materna l grandmother filed a petition to obtain guardianship but failed to appear at the court date. The grandm other also failed to appear at the second hearing, and never acquired legal guardianship of the child prior to the child's death. Approximately six months later, it was reported to the Hotline that the then 6yearold maternal half-sibling was brought to the emergency department by his father because h e had an abrasion, and the side of his face was swollen. The 6yearold disclosed that his 15yearold maternal uncle had kicked him in the face the prior evening. A child protection investigator met with the sibling a nd his father that day. The father explained he was in prison when the maternal grandmother obtained guardiansh ip of the sibling four years earlier, but the sibling had been staying with his father during the week and wo uld spend the weekends with the maternal grandmother. The father reported he observed the injury when th e sibling returned from his visit with the grandmother. The sibling stated the maternal uncle tripped him and kicked him in the face, and the grandmother was at the home when it happened. The child protection investig ator observed the injuries, and the sibling reported the grandmother instructed the sibling to say he hit h is face on the furniture. The sibling also stated the grandmother, mother, and unc le would spank him with their h and, but the sibling denied being fearful of anyone in the home. The child protection investigator also obta ined police reports that included two separate incidents within the prior six months, in which it was reported bullets struck the maternal grandmother's home. No one in the residence was reportedly injured. There was also a report that police responded to the residence 15 due to a physical fight between the grandmother and an adult re lative, which occurred a month prior to the call to the Hotline for the sibling's facial injuries. The child pro tection investigator met with the grandmother, the 15yearold uncle, and the child, who was then 9 months old. Th e 15yearold reported the maternal sibling would not get off his lap, so the uncle pushed him off and the sibling hit his face on a chair. The uncle stated he did not intend to hurt the sibling and acknowledged he respo nded poorly. The grandmother confirmed the uncle's statement and added she applied an ice pack to the sibl ing's face and gave him Tylenol. The grandmother stated they behaved like siblings rather than nephe w and uncle but denied prior incidents between the two. The grandmother also told the child protection investi gator that she had guardianship of the then 9monthold child and had not seen the mother. The Department c losed the investigation and indicated the 15yearold uncle. The supervisor told OIG investigators that t he child protection investigator offered services to the grandmother, but she refused. While the investigation involving the sibling and the uncle was pending, the Departme nt initiated another investigation after police were called to the 6yearold's fath er's residence for a verbal dispute between the father and his paramour. The father reported that he and his pa ramour fought after an incident between the 6yearold and the paramour's 10yearold child. Following an i nvestigation, the Department indicated the 6yearold's father for inadequate supervision. Child protection staff allowed the maternal grandmother to seek guardianship of the child after she was born substance-exposed, but the staff did not initiate intact family services nor Extended Family Support Program (EFSP) services to help the family or mitigate the risk factors . The overall goal of EFSP is to stabilize children living with a relative caregiver, which is primarily done by he lping the caregiver obtain guardianship in probate court and provide other services to enable the relative to care for and meet the children's immediate and long- term needs. However, in this case, the maternal grandmother was left with a temporary guardianship paper and no assistance nor services. Approximately eight months later, t he Department became i nvolved with the family again after initiating an investigation into the maternal sibli ng's facial injuries and learned that the maternal grandmother had still not obtaine d full guardianship of the 1y earold child. 1.

The Department should create policy for when and how to use temporary guardianship during a pending child protection investigation. The Department agrees. The Department will issue communication to the field on the appropriate use of temporary guardianship. In additi on, child protection staff wil l receive training on appropriate use of temporary guardianship. RECOMMENDATIONS 16 5. When temporary guardianship is utilized during a pending chi ld protection investigation in lieu of protective custody, the Department must offer a minimum of Exte nded Family Support Program Services. The Department agrees. The Department will issue a reminder to child protection staff. DEATH AND SERIOUS INJURY INVESTIGATION 4 A 2monthold was brought to the emergency department with a he ad injury and bruising to his face. The mother brought the infant to the hosp ital after returning home from work and finding the infant lethargic and unable to e at. The infant had been in the care of his father while the mother was at work, and the father reported the 1yea rold sibling had hit the infant in the face with a toy. A CT scan showed trauma to the brain, a contusion to the scalp, and bleeding on the brain in four separate areas. Physicians believed the trauma was non-accidental abuse based on the severity of the injuries. The infant was listed in critical condition and died six days later. Follo wing the death, the 1yearold sibling and 7yearold half-sibling came into the care of the Department. The Departme nt indicated the mother and father for the infant's death and for substan tial risk of physical injury/envi ronment injurious to health and welfare. The father was also indicated for head inju ries and was subsequently arres ted and charged with murder. In the year prior to the infant's death, there was one unfounded child protection investigation involving the family. Ten months before the infant's death, it was reported to the Ho tline that the father was sexually abusing the then 6y earold half-sibling. The repo rter stated they did not know if the mother was aware of this as she misused pills. The Department unfounded the mother and father after the half-sibling participated in a forensic interview and stated no one had sexually abused him. The mother also denied the drug use allegations, advising she was a few we eks pregnant. During the child protection investigation, the child protection investigator learned that l ess than two years prior, there had been a domestic incident between the mother and father, but the father had part icipated in domestic violence classes, and the mother stated there had not been another incident. The child pr otection investigator discussed intact family services with the mother, who agreed to cooperate with the serv ices. However, an intact case was not opened, and the child protection investig ator noted in the State Automa ted Child Welfare Information System (SACWIS) the request to open an intact family services case was denied and included an email from an intact administrator. The child protection staff believed the case had been deemed ineligible for intact services. The child protection investigator pro vided the mother with informat ion about specific resources in her community, and the mother agreed to schedule appointments. This child protection investiga tion occurred during a shortage of intact workers and resources coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. The child protection staff that oversaw this investigation told OIG investigators they observed an increase in the denial of intact family services re quests during this period, especially with unfounded investigations, but tha t the situation has improved, and more intact family services resources have become available. An intact administrator told OIG investigators that she did not deny the request for intact services for this family. The administrator stated she often had to request addit ional information from the child protection staff to approve the intact family services requests, which she did f or this case, but did not receive the requested information from the child protection staff. As part of the inf ormation request, the intact administrator asked about the family's service needs that could not be met in the c ommunity. The child protection investigator stated she discussed the information request with her superviso r but stated as she had no additional information to send, they decided to refer the family to community resource s, believing this was their only option at that DEATH INVESTIGATION 17 time. The child protection investigator told OIG investigators that she would have preferred for the family to receive intact services, but the community providers in that ar ea were known to be very helpful. 1. This report should be shared with the child protection inves tigator, supervisor, and area administrator for training purposes. The Department agrees. The repor t has been shared for training purposes with the involved staff. 2. The Department should amend the CFS 2040 referral form to re flect notification to the referring person of whether the case has been accepted, denied, or if mor e information is needed to make a determination and that mechanism should be built into the Compr ehensive Child Welfare Information System (CCWIS ). The Department agrees. The recommendation has been incorporated in revisions to CFS-2040. The revisions will be posted for Proposed Polic y Review by the Office of Chil d and Family Policy. DEATH AND SERIOUS INJURY INVESTIGATION 5 A 6monthold infant was found unconscious and not breathing by his 22yearold mother. The mother reported she was unable to call 911 for over an hour because her cell phone battery was dead. When first responders arrived, the infant's body was in rigor mortis with no obvious signs of trauma or injury. The Department implemented a safety plan for the infant's three surviving siblings to stay with relatives. According to the autopsy repor t, the cause and manner of death were ruled undetermined and the Department unfounded the parents for death by neglect. Prior to the infant's death, the family was investigated three times by the Department for alleg ations of abuse or neglect. The most recent child protection investigation was initiated seven months prior to th e infant's death and unfounded two months prior to the death. The family first came to the atte ntion of the Department in 201 8, prior to the deceased infant's birth, when the Hotline received a call alleg ing that the parents had physical altercations in front of their then 2yearold and 1yearold children and that the father hits the children. The next day, the child protection investigator docum ented she made a good faith attempt to see the children. The following week the re was another report to the Ho tline with similar allegations. Four months after the initial Hotline call, the children were still not seen, and a different child protection investigator was assigned to the investigation. The new child protection investigator cal led the reporter and learned the then 20yearold mother and children had moved out of state. The child protectio n investigator spoke with the mother, who confirmed moving out of state, and then had local law enforceme nt conduct a welfare check. Police confirmed the children were safe. Less than three weeks after the investi gation was reassigned, the Department indicated the father for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by abuse and by neglect and closed the child protection investigation. Approximately nine months later, an anonymous caller reported t o the Hotline that there was significant mold in the home where the mother and her then three children were l iving with a maternal aunt. The aunt informed the child protection investigator that the mother and children did not live with her, and it took almost two months for the child protection investigator to locate the moth er. Once the family was located, the child protection investigator observed the then 3yearold, 2yearol d, and 8monthold siblings to be safe, and the Department unfounded the mother for environmental neglect that same day. RECOMMENDATIONS DEATH INVESTIGATION 18 Less than six months later, the Department investigated the fam ily a third time, after receiving an anonymous report that the mother and maternal aunt used substances and we re not properly caring for the children. The child protection investigator a ttempted to see the family on th e same day the Hotline report was received, and the following week, to no avail. Two months after initiating th e investigation, and after three additional attempts, the child protection investigator located the family. During the in-person visit, the child protection investigator learned the mother had given birth to the infant d ays after the investigation was initiated. The child protection investigator noted the infant and his three siblings had no marks or bruises. The mother denied the allegations and admitted to occasi onal alcohol and marijuana us e. During the third child protection investigation, the family's p rimary doctor informed the child protection investigator that the 4yearold and 3yearold siblings had no t had medical appointments over two years and needed updated immunizations, and the 1yearold sibling and in fant had never been seen at their facility, but the infant had an upcoming appointment. The mother stated she s cheduled appointments for her children, but the following week, she notified the child protection investiga tor that the appointments were canceled by the clinic. The child protection investigator instructed the mother to reschedule the appointments but did not follow up to ensure the mother took the children to the doctor prior t o closing the investigati on. According to medical records, the mother failed to b ring the infant to a rescheduled appointment or any well-child exams prior to his death, and the three surviving siblings were not seen by a doct or until after the infant's death. The child protection investigator told OIG investigators she did not know how often a healthy baby should be seen by a doctor. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) emphasizes the importance of regular medical visits throughout a child's life and developed the periodicity schedul e for children, which is a schedule of screenings and assessments recommended at each well-child visit from infan cy through adolescence. The AAP stresses the critical importance of infan ts being examined by a doctor a t the ages of 3-5 days old, 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 9 months to ensure the child is not exper iencing any developmen tal, psychosocial, or chronic disease issues that may require further intervention or follow-up. Additionally, during the third child protection investigation, the child protection inv estigator discussed intact family services with the mother, who agreed to participate, and the child protection investigator emailed a referral for intact services to her supervisor. The Department indicated the mother for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect t o all four of her children. Two months prior to the infant's death, the investigation was closed without the ch ild protection staff ensuring the family was connected to intact family services. Nine days before the third investigation closed, the supervisor documented in SACWIS that the family would be referred for intact family services for parenting services, individual counseling, a nd domestic violence services. On the day the investig ation closed, the area adminis trator noted in SACWIS that the family was referred for intact services. However, OIG investigators found no evidence that the supervisor sent the intact request to the area administrator for approval, and intact staf f reported that no referral was submitted during the child protection investigation. The supervisor could not recall how the referral was submitted. Department Procedures 302.388(c)(2), Supervisor Approval or Disapproval , requires child protection supervisors to submit the form for intact services to their area administrator \"via D epartment email.\" Additionally, Department Procedures 302.388(e), Case Creation, Opening, Assignment and Transfer , dictates that the child protection supervisor is responsible for cr eating the family case in SACWI S, and the intact family case must be created before the investigation is com pleted and closed in SACWIS. 1. This report should be shared with the child protection inves tigator from the third investigation for training purposes. RECOMMENDATIONS 19 The Department agrees. The report will be shared with the invol ved child protection investigator for training purposes. 2. The child protection supervisor from the third investigation should be counseled for her failure to ensure the family was referred for Intact Family Services in th e third investigation as outlined by procedures 302.388. The Department agrees. The child protection supervisor will be counseled. 3. This report should be shared w ith the regional administrator . The Department agrees. The report has been shared with the regi onal administrator for training purposes. 4. Child protection specialists and child welfare services staf f should be trained on the recommended periodicity schedule for children. The Department agrees. The medical periodicity schedule for chi ldren was reviewed with DCFS and private agency intact family services staff at a statewide training mee ting. All permanency staff have received a copy of the medical periodicity schedule for children. DCFS and priv ate agency permanency staff also received training on this topic. Child Protection Administrators are col laborating with the DCFS medical director to develop a laminated timeline to provide to child protection sta ff with the recommended periodicity schedule for children. In addition, the i nvolved agency conducted a Medi cal Timeline training and training on 0-3 Developmental Screeni ngs for their staff. 5. Procedures should require that when a child protection inves tigator learns that a child 1 month old to 12 months old has never been seen by a doctor, the child protec tion investigator should ensure the child is seen. The Department agrees. The recommendation will be incorporated in revisions to Procedures 300, Reports of Child Abuse and Neglect . DEATH AND SERIOUS INJURY INVESTIGATION 6 A 5monthold infant was found unresponsive after co-sleeping i n a bed with his 26yearold mother. The infant was lying on his side and facing the wall with a pillow between him and the wall, and his mother laid behind him . The mother awoke to find the infant was not breathing and called 911. The 5monthold had been recently dis charged from the hospital after being diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus. The autopsy concluded the inf ant's death was accidental, caused by asphyxia, due to the infant sleeping in soft bedding and co-sleeping in a bed with an adult. The Department unfounded the mother for death by neglect, citing no evidence of blatant disregard for the deceased infant. The infant's mother had one prior unfounded child protection investigation i n the year prior to the infant's death. In 2014, the family first came to the attention of the Departme nt, after the Hotline received a report of substance use and domestic violence betwee n the mother and the father of the oldest maternal half-sibling. The Department unfounded the parents for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect to the oldest maternal half-sibling. Approximately one year prior to the infant's death, it was repo rted to the Hotline that the then 6yearold maternal half-sibling disclosed to her maternal great grandmoth er that she was inappropriately touched by the infant's father while the mother was at work. After the mother was informed of the allegations, the mother DEATH INVESTIGATION 20 spoke with law enforcement, filed for an emergency order of pro tection, and moved her three children out of the father's home to stay with the great grandmother. The day a fter the Hotline report, a child protection investigator went to the great grandmother's residence and inte rviewed the great grandmother, as the mother and children were not home. On that same day, the child protect ion investigator also contacted the county's Children's Advocacy Center (CAC) to complete an intake form and stated she would contact the CAC \"if and when a CAC is needed.\" Three days later, the mother called to i nquire when the CAC interview would be scheduled, and the child protecti on supervisor instructed the c hild protection investigator to follow up with the mother. Almost two months after the Hotline call, the child protection investigator met with the mother and children for the first time. The child protection investigator asked the 6y earold about the allegations while the mother was present, and the child stated she had trouble remembering and t hen denied the allegations. The child protection investigator did not notify law enforcement nor CAC staff prior to interviewing the child. The child protection investigator told OIG investigators that the standard practice was to speak to the child i n a limited fashion prior to seeking a CAC interview, and if the child did not disclose t he sexual abuse to the child protection investigator, then no CAC interview would be scheduled. The child protection investigator also spoke to the mother that day, and the mother stated she wanted to support her daughter, but s he no longer believed th e allegations were true. The mother added she thought the child might have made up the a llegations after the child got into trouble for saying she wanted to live with the great-grandmother. The child protection investigator reported in the OIG interview that she did not reca ll if the mother said she no lon ger wanted a CAC interview during that visit, but stated the mother later told the police that she did not want a CAC interview. After the meeting with the mother and the children, the child protection investigator informed he r supervisor, CAC staff, and law enforcement that the child recanted her stat ement about the sexual abuse. Two months after the child protection investigator interviewed the mother and child, the area administrator approved an extension request because the father still needed t o be interviewed. The area administrator told OIG investigators that when she granted the extension, she did not know that the child protection investigator interviewed the child with her mother present and without a CAC interview. Two weeks after the extension was granted, the child protection supervisor told the child protect ion investigator since the child recanted her statement, the CAC interview was not needed. Almost five months after the Hotline report, the Department unfounded the father for sexual abuse. According to DCFS Procedures 300, in allegations of sexual abus e, the child protection staff should work with their local CAC to schedule a forensic interview with the alleg ed child victim. The purpose of a CAC interview is to minimize the number of times the child recounts the event s and reduce the re-traumatization. CACs employ forensic interviewers, who are specifically trained to conduct sensitive interviews to elicit the most truthful information from an alleged child victim. Further, all intervie ws, including forensic interviews, are most effective when conducted in a timely manner. Because a child's recollection deteriorates over time, an impartial forensic interview should be conducted as soon as possible. 1. This report should be shared with the child protection super visor for training purposes. The Department agrees. The report has been shared with the chil d protection supervisor for training purposes. 2. This report should be shared with the area administrator for training purposes. The Department agrees. The report has been shared with the area administrator for training purposes. 3. This report should be shared with the local Regional Counsel . RECOMMENDATIONS 21 The Department agrees. The report has been shared with the loca l Regional Counsel. 4. A communication clarifying the protocol for coordinating wit h the Children's Advocacy Center should be issued to child protectio n staff in this region. The Department agrees. The proto col was shared w ith child prote ction staff in the involved region at an all- staff meeting. 5. This report should be shared with the child protection inves tigator's current employer for supervision purposes, since this individual is currently employed at a priv ate agency that is under contract with DCFS. The Department agrees. The repor t was shared with the current e mployer for supervision purposes. DEATH AND SERIOUS INJURY INVESTIGATION 7 A 19yearold mother awoke to find her 10monthold infant unre sponsive next to her in bed. The mother admitted that in attempting to get the i nfant to sleep, she held the infant against her until the infant stopped moving. The mot her reported she then fell asleep and awoke to find the infant not breathing. The mother pleaded guilty to inv oluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to nine years in prison. The Department indicated the mother for death and substantial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect and for tying/close confinement to her 2-year-child. The father was indicated for tying/close confinement and substantia l risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect to his 2yearold stepchild. T here were two prior unfounded child protection investigations involving this family within a year of the infan t's death. The mother was involved in six child protection investigations as a minor, two of which were indicated. At the age of 16, the mother had her firs t child, and eight months later, the Department investigated her for inadequate su pervision of that child. The individual who reported the allegation to the H otline later retracted her stat ement, and the report against the mother was unfounded. A year and half later, the Department initiated an investigatio n when the Hotline received a report that the 20yearold father of the then 4monthold infant, the deceased , left bruises on the 2yearold half-sibling, and the 18yearold mother did not intervene. The reporter also all eged the mother and maternal grandfather would blow marijuana smoke in the 2yearold's face, and the family w ould neglect the 2yearold leaving him unattended in his playpen all day. The child protection investi gator observed no marks or bruises on either child. The family lived with multiple people; the mother, who w as pregnant with her third child, explained they were staying with relatives while they were on the public housi ng waitlist. The child protection investigator noted there was no odor of drugs in the home, and the adults' t oxicology screenings were negative. The child protection investigator interviewed the six adults in the home, who all stated they did not witness anyone smoke marijuana around the children , nor physically harm them. The child protection investigator spoke to the mother's 13year old sister, the deceased's aunt, at school, who stated the mother and grandfather did smoke marijuana around bo th children. The sister also shared that she had no concerns about the stepfather hurting the 2yearold but indicated the mother would spank and be rough with the 2yearold, though she had not seen any bruises on the child. The teen added that the mother had previously broken the grandfathe r's wrist during an argument. T he 13yearold aunt reported she felt safe in the home. The child protection investigato rdid not follow-up on the discrepancies reported by the aun t. By the DEATH INVESTIGATION 22 end of the investigation, citing insufficient evidence, the Dep artment unfounded the stepfather for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and wel fare, the mother for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect, and the mother and grandfather for substance misuse. Three months after the second inv estigation closed, the mother brought the 2yearold to the hospital after the sibling appeared to have a seizu re after the mother spanked him . The Department was notified that the mother, who was approximately eight months pregnant, became extremely u pset when medical sta ff began to examine the sibling's back. She started to explain the sibling had brui ses from falling earlier, but medical staff did not see any bruising on the back. At the hospital, the child protec tion investigator photographed a red mark on the sibling's thigh and noted no other bruises. There were also no bruises on the then 9monthold infant. The hospital staff voiced no concerns as medical scans showed no ev idence of abuse, and a nurse stated she could not believe how patient the mot her was with the 2yearold, who appeared to have behavioral issues. Three days later, the child protection investigator visited the family, who was no longer living with relatives and moved into their own home. The mark on the child was gone a nd there was no bruising on either child. The child protection investigator spoke with the mother about appro priate discipline, and she stated she typically used time outs but admitted she occasionally swatted the 2year old over the pants with her hand. The mother had also reached out to a community organization to receive ass istance with the child's behavioral issues. The child protection investigator contacted the organization, and t hey confirmed they conducted a virtual assessment and would be working with the f amily. The Department unfounded the mother for cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries; and cited the spanking, while not appropriate, did not rise to the level of abuse. The 10monthold infant died a pproximately one month after the third investigation clo sed. The child protection investigator from the third inv estigation told OIG investigator s that in addition to seeing the children at the hospital, he made two separate unannounced visits to the home a nd never observed anything concerning. The child protection investigator stated he made more than the requ ired number of contacts with the family because the investigation involved two very young children, and the chi ld protection investigator wanted to ensure they were safe. Throughout the investigation into the child's death, paternal f amily members told the child protection investigator they were concerned by the mother's violent behavi or with the 2yearold, as she would spank or shove the child. Multiple family members also stated the 2year old was left unsupervised and confined in a playpen, highchair, or room for most of the day. When questione d, the father confirmed the allegations were true, stating the mother told him it was the best method to han dle a child with behavioral issues. These child protection investigations were conducted in an area that conducts a high volume of child protection investigations. Department records indicate the field office ha d enough child protection investigators to comply with the caseload requirements in the B.H. Consent Decree, howe ver, parallel investigations are not counted in caseload totals. During interviews with OIG investigators, the child protection investigators and supervisors stated their office has conducted several parallel investigatio ns due to the number of medical facilities in the area. The Department did not consider parallel assignments, or the time spent by child protection investigators on completing needed tasks, in de termining investigative worklo ad. Additionally, child protection investigators informed the OIG about difficulties in obtaining critical medic al records and information from doctors in a timely manner, which has hindered their investigations. 1. A copy of this report should be shared for training purposes with the child protection investigator and supervisor from the second ch ild protection investigation and the child protection investigator from the third child protection investigation. RECOMMENDATIONS 23 The Department agrees. The repor t was shared with the involved staff for training purposes. 2. The Department should develop a system to track parallel ass ignments to better account for the full workload of child protection inv estigators. These results shoul d be shared with area administrators. The Department agrees. Parallel assignments are tracked at the site level and this data is shared between child protection supervisors and area administrators. 3. The Department should collaborate with hospitals/medical sys tems for which obtaining records and/or information has been identified as problematic, to allow for a more efficient and timely exchange of information. The Department agrees. The Office of Legal Services conducted t raining on the use of administrative subpoenas when a hospital, medical provide r or community p artner denies a request for records. In addition, the Office of Legal Services will continue to explore collaboration with hosp itals and medical systems to ensure a timely sharing of information. 4. The child protection investigator should be acknowledged for her thorough and persistent work in the investigation into the child's death. The Department agrees. The child protection investigator was co mmended for her work on the involved child protection investigation. DEATH AND SERIOUS INJURY INVESTIGATION 8 A mother reported she checked on her 7yearold child in the mi ddle of the night and found him not breathing. The child's autopsy revealed the c ause of death to be suffocation and the manner of death was homicide. The mother wa s charged with first degree murder and aggravated battery to a child. The Department unfounded the mot her and father for death by abuse and indicated both parents for death by neglect, citing that the mother denie d she caused the child's death. The father was also indicated for substantial risk of physical injury/environm ent injurious to the child. The family had an extensive history with the Department including an unfounded ch ild protection investigation within a year of the child's death. Since 2013, the mother had been involved in 15 child protection investigations, 13 of which were unfounded, largely stemming from the mother's men tal health and substance use issues. In March 2014, an intact family services case was opened following a Hotline report that the then 5monthold child had scratches over his face and head , and the then 4yearold maternal half-sibling was in the car when the mother drove to a counseling appointmen t while she was overmedicated and intoxicated. The mother was subsequently admitted to the hospit al. While the mother was hospitalized, the two maternal half-siblings stayed with their father, and the child resided with fictive kin as part of a safety plan. The child returned to his parents in July 2014. Four months later, the intact case closed. In 2015, the mother was involved in three child protection investigations, and the Depa rtment indicated the mother in one of those investigations for cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral in juries to the then 6yearold maternal half-sibling. Additionally, between 2018 and 2020, there were five child prot ection investigations involving the family, all of which were unfounded. In April 2019, the Department in itiated a child protection inve stigation after the father brought the mother to the hospital due to an overdose, and the mother disclosed she t ook the pills while she was alone with her DEATH INVESTIGATION 24 children. The mother added she knew the father would be home so on and felt they all would be better off without her. The mother was admitted to the hospital. The mothe r signed a consent for release of information that allowed the Department to have access to her medical and m ental health information. The child protection investigator saw the children that day, and the children report ed feeling safe in their home. Almost a month later, the child protection investigator contacted the mother, who stated she was doing better since she was discharged and was attending counseling twice a month. The chil d protection investigator scheduled a visit with the mother, but two weeks later, the father called to reschedul e the visit for that day because the mother was back in the hospital. The child p rotection investigator request ed, received, and reviewed the mother's hospital records. The child protection in vestigator also requested recor ds from mother's mental health provider, but OIG investigators found no evidence that these records were obtaine d nor was there any documentation that anyone spoke with mental health treatment providers. Five days after r equesting the mental health provider's records, the Department unfounded the moth er due to insufficient evidenc e. The child protection supervisor agreed with the recommended unfounded finding noting that the mother took t he pills knowing the father would be home soon, and that the children we re unaware of the overdose. Less than two months later, the Department initiated an investi gation after the mother was again hospitalized for suicidal ideation and an overdose. It was reported to the H otline that the mother's suicidal ideation was ongoing, she had been hospitalized numerous times, and she admi tted to struggling with caring for her children and would hit them. A child protection investigator spoke with the mother at the hospital, and she stated the children were asleep when she took the pills, but approximately 30 minutes later, she b ecame scared and woke up her husband, who called 911. The mother stated she hoped the maternal half-siblings' father would help in caring for the children, because she could not handle the child ren anymore, and the child protection investigator discussed placing the children with a family member or friend u ntil the mother could stabilize on her medication. The child protection investigator spoke with the ma ternal half-siblings' father who agreed to assume full time care of his child ren, and the child protection investigator instructed him to go to family court and obtain a custody order. The child protection investigator a lso observed the children, and the then 10yearold maternal half-sibling stated she felt safe at her f ather's home, but not at her mother's residence. The 6yearold's father had already been granted full custody a nd legal guardianship of the child, despite the 6yearold and the father living in the home with the mother. T he child protection investigator assessed the children as safe since they would be staying with their fathers and did not know about their mother's overdose. It was recommended that the family be referred for intact famil y services. An intact family services referral form noted that the mother had on going mental health issues an d disclosed she could not care for her children. The form further stated that b ecause the 6yearold and his fat her lived in the same home as the mother, they required daycare and other services to help the mother with her mental health issues. The mother was open to receiving intact services and agreed to sign a consent for rele ase of information for her mental health records. While the child protection investigation was still pending, the mother was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, but the child protection supervisor noted none of the children were in the car. Two days after the mother's arrest, the Department unfounded the mother for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect, citing the children were asleep during the overdose and currently resided with their fathers. An intact fa mily services case was not opened. Ten months later, the Hotline received a report that the mother was often under the influence while the child was in her care. The reporter alleged the child's father was aw are of this but continued to leave the 7yearold child with the mother when he worked. It was also reported that the 8yearold and 11yearold maternal half- siblings would visit the mother, and she would sleep or was int oxicated while the children went outside without adult supervision. The child pro tection investigator spoke to t he mother and father, w ho denied the allegations and stated that the mother had mostly stopped consuming alcohol since her arrest. The mother reported she regularly attended counseling and listed the medications she wa s taking, reporting none of them made her drowsy. The father confirmed th e medications did not affect her functioning and added he would not leave the children in her care if she was impaired. The parents also deni ed the use of physical discipline. The father signed 25 the release of information form to allow the child protection i nvestigator to access the child's records, and the mother signed the release of information form to release her ow n medical and mental health records. However, OIG investigators found no indication that the records were req uested. The maternal half-siblings' father told the child protection investigator that he had custody of his ch ildren, but they visited their mother on the weekends, and he denied having c oncerns while his daughters wer e with their mother. The child protection investigator observed the maternal half-siblings to be in good health with no injuries. T hey separately reported they felt safe visiting their mo ther and denied she used physic al discipline or left them unsupervised. The 7yearold child was staying with fictive kin for the summer an d reported to the child protection investigator that he was not afraid of his father, but he would rather live with the fictive kin because his mother would hit him. The child also stated the mother tried to drown him in the bathtub and believed this happened when he was 4 years old. When the Department initiated the child protec tion investigation, the m other offered to take a toxicology screening to prove she did not use illegal drugs, bu t it took over a month for the child protection investigator to refer her for a toxicology screening, for which she tested negative. The child protection investigator contacted the mother's current counselor, who repo rted the mother's regular counselor was on maternity leave. The counselor re ported the mother's prognosis was fair, but it would be better if she did not continue to use alcohol. The counselor also stated the mother w as recently in an intensive residential rehabilitation program for a few weeks, but she left the progra m early. Additionally, the child protection investigator spoke to the matern al grandmother who reported the child would be better off in the care of the fictive kin. The paternal grandm other also reported concerns to the child protection investigator, stating she saw bruises on the child, and he disclosed the mother attempted to drown him in the bathtub. The paternal grandmother added she asked the father to move in with her to g et the child out of the home with the mother. The Department unfounded the inv estigation with a referral for community-based service s, citing the mother denied the allegation, passed the toxicology screening, and was in counseling. Both the child protection investigator and supervisor no longer worked for the Department at the time this report was issued. The child's death was reported to the Hotlin e less than five months after t he child protection investigation was unfounded. In both investigations following the mother's psychiatric hospi talization admissions, the Department unfounded the mother, citing evidence that focused on the factors surroun ding mother's suicide attempts rather than the actual risk her behavior created. In both incidents, it was rea soned that the children did not know of her attempts, but child protection staff faile d to recognize that the childre n were still under the care of an impaired parent. It was also concerning that both child protection investigators kn ew that the mother was receiving mental health services, yet these records were never obtained, despite the mo ther signing the consent form. The gathering of information is critical to any assessment of child safety. When child protection investigators learn that a caregiver may have a mental hea lth issue, child protection staf f are required by Department procedures to obtain any mental health records. The p rocedures also direct staff to refer to the CFS 440-12, Investigation/Intact Parental Mental Health Case Matrix to be used as a guide to the types of information to be obtain ed regarding the caregivers' mental health. Additionally, in 2018 and 2021, in two previous investigations involving mothers with mental health issues, the O IG recommended that child prote ction staff utilize the CFS 968-90, Questions for Mental Health Professionals . The Department agreed to adapt the form for use by child prot ection investigators, however, at the time of this child's death, this recommendation had not been implemented. 1. As previously recommended in 2016 IG 2558 and 2021 IG 0018, the Department should develop a form similar to the CFS 968-90, Questions for Mental Health Professionals to be utilized by child protection staff when interviewing mental health professionals regarding an alleged perpetrator. The Department agrees. In collaboration with the Clinical Divis ion, DCFS Medical Director, and Child Protection Division, Policy Transmittal 2022.11, Procedures 300.50, was issued on September 27, 2022, to inform staff that effective immediately Procedure 300.50, Investigative Process , and form CFS968-90, RECOMMENDATIONS 26 Questions for Mental Health Professionals have been amended. The form can now be used by the divisions o f child protection, intact fam ily services and permanency. 2. The Department should consider developing a guide for child protection staff to address deficiencies identified in child protection in vestigations in which parental mental health was identified. The guide should remind staff of the procedural requirements to obtain me ntal health records and interview treatment providers, as well as direction on the use of the men tal health matrix and the revised CFS 968- 90 form. Once developed, the guide should be discussed at regio nal meetings with child protection staff. The Department agrees. In collaboration with the Clinical Divis ion, DCFS Medical Director, and Child Protection Division, Policy Transmittal 2022.11, Procedures 300.50, was issued on September 27, 2022, to inform staff that effective immediately Procedure 300.50, Investigative Process , and form CFS968-90, Questions for Mental Health Professionals have been amended. The form can now be used by the divisions o f child protection, intact family services and permanency. The fo rm now includes a section for household members and their relationship to the client; a section to iden tify any tests, assessments, or evaluations the client has taken and a request to receive the client's most recent men tal health assessment, psychiatric evaluation, psychological evaluation, and tr eatment plan; and sections to g ather referral, medication, additional treatment plan and provider credential information. The amended changes t o Procedures 300.50, Investigative Process and CFS 968-90 was communicated acr oss child protection teams s tatewide. 3. Department should designate clinical consultants with expert ise in mental health who caseworkers, supervisors, and child protectio n investigators can access for assistance, education, and information. The availability of clinical consultan ts as a resource should be co mmunicated to child protection staff. The Department agrees. The recommendation will be incorporated in the Department's redesign of the Clinical Division. The anticipated completion date is July 2023. 4. The Department should review the death investigation to dete rmine if a more appropriate finding would be to indicate the mother for death by abuse. The Department agrees that the more appropriate finding would h ave been to indicate the mother for death by abuse. The investigation was reviewed as a learning opportunity with the field. The Department will utilize this case in ongoing trainings. DEATH AND SERIOUS INJURY INVESTIGATION 9 A 28yearold mother pushed her 5yearold child from the 6th f loor of a parking garage, and then jumped herself. The mother and child survived the fall, but the child sustained severe injuries that included extensive skull and fac ial fractures, traumatic b rain injury, bilateral upper extremity fractures, cervical spin e injury, and internal injuri es. The Department indicated the mother for head injuries, bone fractures, other physical injuries, and substant ial risk of physical injury by neglect. The mother was criminally charged with aggr avated battery to a child. In t he year prior to the serious injury, the Department had unfounded two child protecti on investigations involving the family, and at the time of the serious injury, there were two pending child pr otection investigations involvin g the family. The family first came to the attention of the Department in 201 6 with a report to the Hotline of drug use by the child's father, and again in 2017 wit h reports of drug use SERIOUS INJURY INVESTIGATION 27 by the mother. Both child protection investigations were unfoun ded. The parents separated in 2018 and shared custody of their child. In 2019, two years prior to the child's serious injury, the Dep artment initiated a child protection investigation after the mother was psychiatri cally hospitalized with suicidal ideation, and she stated she had thoughts of killing the then 3yearold child . The reporter stated the moth er subsequently denied sh e would harm the child and noted that the maternal grandmother and the father were car ing for the child during the mother's hospitalization. The child protection investigator went to the maternal grandmother's residence on the same day of Hotline report, but no one answered the door. The child prot ection investigator also contacted the reporter. During their OIG interview, the child protection investigator s tated she could not recall if she discussed anything with the reporter beyond confir ming the Hotline report. That sa me day, a parallel child protection investigator interviewed the mother at the hospital. The mother stated she w as taking her medication, feeling fine, and would be discharged the following day. T he mother added she had a cas e manager from a private agency where she was receiving services. The mother stated she did not need any additional services and refused to sign the consent forms to release her information to the Department. The primary child protection investigator told OIG investigators that she did not interview the mother's case mana ger and did not know what services the mother was receiving. During the child protection investigation, child protection sta ff did not interview medical or mental health providers, nor did they obtain the mother's mental health recor ds, which documented a significant history of mental health concerns. In the six months prior to the 2019 Hot line call, the mother was psychiatrically hospitalized 11 times, and she had been discharged from a short -term intensive outpatient treatment program after arriving visibly high on marijuana on multiple occasions. The records noted the hospital discharged the mother the day after she spoke to the parallel child protection investigator and was scheduled for a follow-up appointment less than two weeks la ter, but she did not attend t he appointment. The primary child protection investigator attempted to see the child and mother at the residence the day of the mother's discharge, but they were not home. The m other and mate rnal grandmother return ed the call, reported they were leaving for a two-week vacation and agreed to contact the child protection investigator when they returned. Three weeks after th e Hotline call, the child protect ion investigator met with the child for the first time and noted she was free of observable signs of abuse or neg lect. The mother told the child protection investigator she was psychiatrically hospitalized due to being stressed and denied she made a statement about harming her child. The mother re ported she had been meeting wit h her therapist for approximately six months, was prescribed psychiatric medication, and denied substance use . The maternal grandmother told the child protection investigator that she had no concerns about the moth er's parenting and stated the child stayed with her father after the mother's hospital admission. OIG investiga tors found no evidence that the father was contacted during this investigation, and the child protection i nvestigator could not recall if he was interviewed. Less than one month after the child protection investigation wa s initiated, the Department unfounded the investigation. Seven months later, the Hotline received a report that the fath er used heroin in the presence of his 4yearold child and had been arrested for possession of heroin. A paralle l child protection investigator saw the child the next day while she was visiting her father at a relative's home . The child protection investigator noted the child was without injury and appeared bonded to her father. The fathe r told the child protection investigator that the mother had been violating thei r custody agreement and occasiona lly denied him access to t he child. The father reported the mother had a history of mental health issues and f requent psychiatric hospitalizations, and she did not comply with her medication or treatment. The father acknowl edged prior drug use and treatment. He admitted he was arrested for heroin possession the previous mon th and was out on bond. The child protection investigator requested he submit to a toxicology screening, but the father refused. The child protection investigator also attempted to see the child at the mother's re sidence, but she refused to cooperate. Days later, the child protection investigato r observed the child at the father's residence, and the child re ported she felt safe 28 with both parents. The child protection investigator observed n o signs of environmental neglect or substance use in the residence. Two months after the Hotline call, the De partment unfounded the investigation. Less than three months later, the Hotline received another repo rt that the father was using substances in the presence of the child. Two days into the Department's investiga tion, the Hotline received a report that police responded to the mother's home due to a disagreement between th e parents over the visitation agreement. The mother told police she had the father's visitation rights revok ed and reported the child was holding bags of heroin when the child was at her father's home. The Hotline cal l was taken as related information to the pending child protection investigation. The child protection investigat or observed the child at the mother's home, and the child reported feeling safe in the homes of both parents. T he child protection investigator also interviewed the father, who admitted he had relapsed but had not used subst ances in the months since then. The father shared that the mother obtained an emergency cease of his visitation, but the judge overturned it and ordered supervised visitation, which the paternal grandfather agreed to supervise. The judge additionally ordered the father to complete a toxicology screening, and the father agreed to share his results with the child protection investigator. The father's toxicology screening was negative, and after his p rior arrest, the court ordered the father to participate in substance use disorder services and random toxic ology screenings. The Department unfounded the investigation. Less than two months later, the Hotline received a report that the father was under the influence of heroin while caring for his child on multiple occasions. The child protectio n investigator made multiple attempts to the see the child at both the mother and father's homes, but the mother was uncooperative, and the father did not respond. Three weeks later, while the prior investigation was p ending, the Department initiated another investigation after receiving a report that the father was high on heroin while the child was in his care. The same child protection investigator went to the mother's residen ce to see the child that same day, but the mother became upset when the child prot ection investigator arrived. Th e mother initially denied access to the child, but eventually allowed the child pro tection investigator to see the child through the glass door. The mother refused to allow more contact and closed the door on the child protecti on investigator. Approximately three weeks after the last call to the Hotline, t he mother pushed the child from the sixth floor of a parking garage and then jumped herself. The Department indica ted the mother for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect; cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse; head injuries by abuse; and bone fractures by abuse. Following the child's serious injury, the Department indicated the father in both pending child protectio n investigations for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. In the 2019 investigation, the c hild protection investigator an d supervisor failed to interview the child's father, see the child in a timely manner, or verify the mother's compli ance with her medication and mental health treatment. DCFS Procedures 300.50(c)(6)(D), Obtain Any Mental Health R ecords of Parents/Caregivers , states if a parent refuses to sign a c onsent form, the child protectio n investigator shall request an administrative subpoena for the records within two business days of the refusa l. DCFS Procedures further require that if a child protection investigator finds, during an investigation, t hat a family member was ad mitted to a psychiatric facility, the child protection investigator shall obtain any in formation that could impact the child's safety from the facility's staff. The child protection investigator is also required to participate in any discharge planning and recommendations and shall fo llow-up with community provider s identified during the staffing. The Procedures directs staff to CFS 440-12, Investigation/Intact Parental Mental Health Case Matrix to be used as a guide to the types of information to be obtained regarding ca regivers' mental health. The child protection supervisor of the 2019 investigation told OIG investigators tha t she had never seen the case matrix prior to speaking with the OIG. Had the child protection staff used the matrix, it would have assisted in obtaining the mother's full mental health history, as well as assessing her m ental health functioning and future service needs. 29 In September 2018 and June 2021, in two investigations that inv olved mothers with mental health issues, the OIG previously recommended that child protection staff utilize the CFS 968-90, Questions for Mental Health Professionals . The Department agree d to adapt the form for use by child prot ection staff; however, at the time of this report, this recommendation had not been implemented. 1. As previously recommended in 2016 IG 2558 and 2021 IG 0018, the Department should develop a form similar to the CFS 968-90, Questions for Mental Health Professionals to be utilized by child protection staff when interviewing mental health professionals regarding an alleged perpetrator. The Department agrees. In collaboration with the Clinical Divis ion, DCFS Medical Director, and Child Protection Division, Policy Transmittal 2022.11, Procedures 300.50, was issued on September 27, 2022, to inform staff that effective immediately Procedure 300.50, Investigative Process , and form CFS968-90, Questions for Mental Health Professionals have been amended. The form can now be used by the divisions o f child protection, intact fam ily services and permanency. 2. The Department should consider developing a guide to address deficiencies identified in child protection investigations in which parental mental health was i dentified. The guide should remind staff of the procedural requirements to obtain mental health records and interview treatment providers, as well as direction on the use of the mental health matrix and th e revised CFS 968-90 form. Once developed the guide should be discussed at regional meetings with child p rotection staff. The Department agrees. In collaboration with the Clinical Divis ion, DCFS Medical Director, and Child Protection Division, Policy Transmittal 2022.11, Procedures 300.50, was issued on September 27, 2022, to inform staff that effective immediately Procedure 300.50, Investigative Process , and form CFS968-90, Questions for Mental Health Professionals have been amended. The form can now be used by the divisions o f child protection, intact family services and permanency. The fo rm now includes a section for household members and their relationship to the client; a section to iden tify any tests, assessments, or evaluations the client has taken and a request to receive the client's most recent men tal health assessment, psychiatric evaluation, psychological evaluation, and tr eatment plan; and sections to g ather referral, medication, additional treatment plan and provider credential information. The amended changes t o Procedures 300.50, Investigative Process and CFS 968-90 was communicated acr oss child protection teams s tatewide. 3. The child protection investigator of the 2019 investigation should be disciplined for failure to interview the father, see the child in a timely manner, and obtain mental health records during the course of the investigation. The Department agrees. The child protection investigator will b e disciplined. 4. The child protection supervisor of the 2019 investigation sh ould be disciplined for failing to ensure that the father was interviewed, the child was seen in a timely manner, and mental health records were obtained during the course of the investigation. The Department agrees. The child protection supervisor will be disciplined. RECOMMENDATIONS 30 DEATH AND SERIOUS INJURY INVESTIGATION 10 The stepmother found the 14yearold hanging from a jump rope i n her closet. At the time of her death, the teen lived with her father and stepm other, who had an open placement case. The Department first became i nvolved with the teen in 2012, aft er receiving a report that the father pulled the hair of the teen, who was then 5 yea rs old, during a family therapy session. The Department unf ounded the investigation. In December 2015, it was reported to the Hotline that the father gave a black eye and cigarette burn to the teen , who was then 9 years old. The father told the child protection investigator that he struck the teen in the fa ce after she threatened to swallow pills to kill herself, and he accidently burned her with a cigarette while she played on the sofa several months earlier. The stepmother corroborated his statements, and the teen reported b oth incidents were accidental but denied she made the suicidal statement. The father also stated the teen ha d a mental health disorder and did not take her medication as prescribed, and he stopped taking medication for his mental health disorders but agreed to speak with his doctor about re-starting his psychotropic medication. The father denied he would harm his family, and the stepmother reported she could recognize when he was about t o go into a rage, stating she would leave with the teen and the teen's 9yearo ld and 20monthold stepsibling s. However, in January 2016, the father called the child protection investigator to request the removal of the teen from his care, as he feared his anger would cause him to harm her. The child protection investigator went t o the home with police and informed the stepmother that she needed to l eave with the children due to th e risk posed by the father. The stepmother refused to leave, the couple argued, and the father threatened to choke the stepmother. The Department took protective custody of the three children and subsequently released the tee n to the care of her mother with court-ordered intact family services. The court granted the Department tempor ary custody of the two stepsiblings, and the Department placed them in foster care, opened a placement case, and indicated the child protection investigation. The intact worker documented the mother's history of domestic v iolence, substance use, and mental health disorders. The teen began trauma therapy to address her mental health diagnosis. The court closed the mother's intact family services case in M ay 2016, and the caseworker ass essed the teen as safe in her mother's care. One year later, the mother brought the then 10yearold teen to a DCFS office because the mother planned to move out of state with her paramour, without the teen. The moth er stated the teen had mental health issues, including a prior suicide attempt. The mother also reported her own mental illness, that included a major mental illness and a personality disorder, hindered her ability to car e for her daughter. The mother reported she planned to take the teen to her father, who continued to have an open p lacement case with the stepsiblings. The Department took protective cust ody of the teen in June 2017, pl aced her in a traditional foster home, indicated the mother, and the mother then surrendered her parental rights to the teen. Throughout the remainder of teen's case, she participated in weekly intensive placement services, where she received counseling, group therapy, and medication management. During the father and stepmother's open placement case, they pa rticipated in parenting classes, received individual and couples counseling, completed a parenting group for children with mental health issues, and received monitoring of their psy chotropic medications. Througho ut 2018, the teen's visits with her father and stepmother were increased, and in December 2018, the court retu rned the teen to her father and stepmother. The next year, the court returned the two stepsiblings to the f ather and stepmother, and they participated in aftercare services for three m onths until the case closed in Ma y 2019. In July 2019, the Hotline received a call after police conducte d a child welfare check following a report that the father allegedly was verbally abusive and kicked the then 12ye arold teen out of the home, which had multiple environmental issues, including an insect infestation, and lack ed food. The police observed no infestation and the home had sufficient food. The teen had been staying with an other individual for the last five days, and the DEATH INVESTIGATION 31 father told law enforcement he would sign guardianship of the t een over to the individual since the teen had been \"difficult.\" The Department took no further action. The Department initiated a child protection investigation in Oc tober 2019, after police responded to a report that the teen's stepfather sent inappropriate, sexually graphic text messages to the then 12yearold teen. The child protection investigator spoke with the father, who no lon ger allowed the teen to visit her mother due the text messages. The father told the child protection investigato r that the teen was mentally ill and had a history self-injury, and he had difficulty meeting her needs due to his own mental illness. The teen reported she got along well with her fat her and reported not w anting to have con tact with her mother since she chose to remain with the stepfather. The police charged the stepfather with ind ecent solicitation of a child and a predatory charge a class 4 felony. The Department indicated the stepfather for s exual exploitation and indicated the mother for substantial risk of physical inj ury/environment injurious to he alth and welfare by neglect. In December 2019, the Departmen t investigated allegations of en vironmental neglect in the father and stepmother's home. The child protection investigator noted the 5yearold and 13yearold stepsiblings appeared to be clean and well cared for, and they stated they f elt safe in the home. The child protection investigator also observed the home had no infestations nor env ironmental hazards. The teen did not engage with the child protection investigator. The father explained th e teen had difficulty with being bullied, and he spoke to the school staff about it. The school staff told the c hild protection investigator that they developed a plan for the teen to identify staff for her to talk with as nee ded, after she required psyc hiatric hospitalization in October 2019 for cutting herself. The school reported she also received mental health services. The investigation was unfounded. In August 2020, a child protecti on investigation was initiated after the 6yearold stepsibling came to the emergency department with severe neck bruising, stating her fat her's paramour choked he r. The stepmother told the child protection investigator that the 6yearold sust ained the injuries while visiting with her father, who lived in the same building as their family. The teen's step mother moved the stepsiblings to stay with their maternal grandmother and stated t he teen stayed away from the s tepsiblings' father and his paramour, as she did not like them. The child protection investigator, however, did not interview nor assess the teen during this investigation. Police charged th e paramour with aggravated dome stic battery/strangulation to a child under 13, and an order of protection prohib ited the paramour having conta ct with the 6yearold. The stepsiblings' father was indicated for inadequate supervision and the paramour for c uts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries. One month into the pending child protection investigation, the court ordered the stepmother to participate in intact family services. The intact family case, assigned to a p rivate agency, listed the members in the case as the stepmother, father, two step siblings, and the stepsiblings' father. The then 13yearold teen was not included as a case member as the father reported she lived elsewhere, an d the father and stepmother moved out of the building. While the child protection investigation of injuries to the 6y earold stepsibling was pending, the Hotline received a report that the father dropped off the teen at a fic tive kin's home one month earlier due to housing instability. According to the reporter, the father told the fic tive kin to obtain temporary guardianship of the teen through court, but then the father did not attend court, and he wanted the teen returned to his home. The reporter also expressed concerns about the father's mental health disord ers, noncompliance with medication, and history of violence. The Hotline worker determined the report did not m eet criteria for further action as the reporter did not provide information that the father could not care for his daughter, he made an alternative living arrangement for her, and he retained guardianship of the teen with the righ t to custody. The supervisor of the family's intact family services case, which opened one day after the Hotline ca ll, reported to OIG investigators that they did not know about this report to the Hotline. The same day of Hotl ine call, the fictive kin f iled an emergency order of protection, which the court granted. This provided the ficti ve kin with physical custody of the teen, as the petition stated the father had been violent towards the teen an d kicked her out of the home. Less than three weeks later, the father and fictive kin attended court for the plenary orde r, and the court closed the case as the 32 order was voluntarily dismissed. At that time, the fictive kin filed a petition for guardianship of the teen, which the court dismissed the following week, as the fictive kin fail ed to attend the court date. During the open intact family services case, about one week bef ore the plenary hearing, the father and stepmother reported parenting th e teen as part of the interview s for the integrated assessment. Almost two weeks later, the intact worker visited the maternal grandmother's hom e and met with the father, stepmother and two stepsiblings. The teen was not mentioned. The parents reported they lived in their van and occasionally stayed with the maternal grandmother or the maternal uncle. The follow ing week, the intact supervisor and worker attended a court hearing, where t he judge awarded the Departmen t temporary custody of the two stepsiblings due to concerns about the fathe r's mental health and housing is sues. The intact supervisor reported that while at the courthouse, the father asked why the court left the teen in his care but removed his stepchildren. The intact supervisor told OIG investigators that she did not know the teen was in her father's care prior to this court date and reported the ASA and the Guardian ad Litem (GAL) also learned of this during the court date. The intact supervisor stated she asked the GAL if she should call t he Hotline about the teen being in his care, but the GAL stated a petition would be filed separately for the tee n, so she did not need to contact the Hotline. The GAL told OIG investigators she did not dissuade the intact supe rvisor from calling the Hotline. The GAL reported she discussed the situation with the ASA, and they agr eed the teen should enter care, but they could not proceed for shelter care that day since the teen did not ha ve an open court case. The GAL stated she did not follow up to ensure the ASA filed the petition. No petition was filed for the teen prior to her death, which occurred two months later. OIG investigators interviewed the De partment legal staff assigned to that region, who reported the teen was not included as a member of the court case because she was not included in the child protection investigator's statement of facts from the August 20 20 investigation. At the time of the court hearing, Department legal staff believed the teen was not a member of th e household and could not recall when the teen began living with her father again. The private agency transferred the family to a placement worker and assigned the same supervisor to oversee the case. Four weeks after the court hearing, the stepmother as ked during a phone call with the supervisor and placement worker if the teen could attend the parent/child visi ts with the stepsiblings, and the supervisor approved for her to attend some visits. Throughout the remainde r of the placement case, there was no evidence that the worker nor the supervis or obtained additional informat ion about teen's living arrangements nor discussed her safety and well-being. Eleven days before the tee n's death, the worker met with the father and stepmother in their home but noted no indication of the teen du ring this visit. 1.

DEATH AND SERIOUS INJURY INVESTIGATION 11 A 12yearold was admitted to the emergency department for gast rointestinal issues, including abdominal pain, constipation, and fecal impaction. Th e next day, the child went into cardiac arrest during emergency surgery for an intest inal perforation and was pronounced deceased. The medical examiner determined the death was caused by perfora tion of the cecum due to complications of chronic constipation and reported the manner of death as natura l. The Department unfounded the mother for allegations of death by neglect to the child and substantial ri sk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect to the child's three siblings. In the year prior to the child's death, there was an unfounded child protection investigation involving the family. Between 2012 and 2017, the Depar tment conducted three child pro tection investigations and unfounded the child's parents in all three i nvestigations, which involved allegations of cuts, bruises, welts, and medical negle ct. In October 2018, the Department initiated a child protection in vestigation after receiving a report that the then 9yearold child had gastroint estinal issues that affected her schooling, which included soiling herself, crying spells, and angry outbursts. The r eporter told the Hotline that the child disclosed her mother did not provide her with medication which resulted in difficulty sleeping due to th e pain. A child protection investigator interviewed the child, who confirmed she experienced frequent constipation and did not always take her medication, resulting in a painful buildup in her stomach. The child protec tion investigator then spoke to the mother, who denied failing to give the child her medication, reporting she gave her a fiber supplement, but it took several days to become effective. The mother stated that after the chil d's previous hospitalization for gastrointestinal issues, the doctors instructed her to give the child a specific over the counter laxative for future constipation. The child protection investigator contacted the child's primary care provider, and the nurse reported the child was first seen in January 2017 for chronic constipation, and th e doctor recommended the l axative and to follow- up with a gastrointestinal specialist. The nurse stated the chi ld required hospitalization in March 2017 at a different medical center, and at d ischarge, staff instructed th e mother to follow-up with the gastrointestinal clinic. Almost two months after initiating the investigation, t he child protection investigator followed up with the child, who reported she felt better and had not needed her medication lately. The next day, the child protection supervisor agreed there was insufficient evidence to indicate the mother for m edical neglect, and the Department closed the investiga tion. There was no documentation that the child protection investigator requested the child's medical records or contacted the medical center where the child was hospitalized. The OIG obtained the medical records, which documented the mother d id not ensure that the child received appropriate follow-up care or take her medication as prescribed . Less than three weeks later, in December 2018, the Department i nitiated a child protection investigation after receiving a report that the child's then 13yearold sibling fr equently complained of arthritis pain at school. The reporter stated the sibling's juvenile arthritis required infus ions every three months and weekly injections, but the sibling disclosed her last infusion occurred 10 months earl ier. The reporter also had concerns about the child experiencing pain from her gast rointestinal issues, causing fre quent school absences. The child told the child protection investigato r that her stomach felt better a nd did not remember the last tim e she took her medicine. DEATH INVESTIGATION 34 The 13yearold sibling reported she had not received her arthr itis injections for months, causing her to experience pain and miss school. The mother informed the child protection investigator that the sibling's treatment required regular blood tests, and hospital staff woul d notify her after the test results to approve the injection. The mother stated the sibling had a blood test three months ago, but she never heard from the hospital. The mother stated her insurance lapsed the previous week, and s he planned to follow-up with the public aid office and obtain medical appointments for her children. The ch ild protection investigator followed up with the children two months later, and the 13yearold sibling reported she continued to experience pain because she had not seen her doctor and her injections expired. The child d enied recent constipation and could not recall the last time she saw her doctor. The mother declined a referral fo r intact family services and stated she had not made any appointments because the medical card application had been delayed, but she agreed to schedule medical appointments that day. The child protection investigato r contacted the hospital and confirmed the mother scheduled the sibling's a ppointment. Hospital staff repo rted the sibling had not had infusions for nearly a year and failure to treat the sibling's significant arthritis would be considered medical neglect. The hospital staff stated a lack of insurance would not be a reason for not seeking treatment as the hospital had resources to assist patients. The supervisor i nstructed the child protection investigator to obtain the medical records, who then sent requests to the hospital and primary care provider. H owever, the investigation closed two days later, prior to receipt of medical record s. The Department indicated t he mother for medical neglect of the 13yearold sibling, because she failed to ensure the sibling received her treatment. The Department unfounded the mother for medical neglect of the ch ild, reasoning the child stated sh e felt better. Approximately 10 months later, in January 2020, the Department initiated an investigation, after receiving a report that the then 11yearold child had visible tooth decay and reported tooth pain. The reporter stated school staff attempted to assist the mother in obtaining dental care, but she did not return the school's calls. The reporter also had concerns about the mother's ability to manage the chil d's gastrointestinal issu es as the child recently required hospitalization for an intestinal blockage. The same d ay as the Hotline report, an on-call child protection investigator attempted to see the family with no suc cess. Less than one week later, the Hotline received a related information call, stating the child had not taken her prescribed daily laxative since her discharge from the hospital the prior week. The reporter stated the child complained at school of abdominal pain, which the medicine would have helped. During the pending investigation, child protection staff did not address information contained in the related information call, including investigating the mother's reported failure to administer the child's medicine. The child protection investigator did not see the family until almost two months after the investigation opened, and in an interview with the OIG, the child protection investig ator could not explain the delay in seeing the children. Once the child protection investigator saw the family , the mother stated she took the child to the dentist, but the child required a referral to a specialist due to her fear of the dentist and refusal to be examined. The child did not see the specia list because the office closed in response to the pandemi c. The child confirmed this information and showed the child protection investigator h er tooth, stating it no longer hurt. The mother also reported the child was hosp italized for gastrointestinal i ssues but did not have treatment or discharge documentation. The mother reporte d she gave the child the laxat ive, and the child told the child protection investigator she felt better. That same day, the child protecti on investigator requested the child's hospital records; however, the investigation file did not contain the me dical records. The next day, the child protection investigator contacted the dental provider, who confirmed the c hild's referral, but the child protection investigator never spoke with the specialist because their offi ce remained closed due to the pandemic. Two months after the report to t he Hotline, the Department clos ed the investigation and unfounded the mother for medical neglect, citing insufficient evidence to support th e allegations. The supervisor approved contact waivers for both reporters, the primary care provider, the scho ol, and collateral contacts. The child protection investigator only documented performing investigative duties fo r the last two days of the investigation. In an interview with the OIG, the child protection supervisor reporte d being unaware of the delay in seeing the family 35 and that the child protection investigator should have requeste d the medical records at the onset of the investigation instead of the day before its closure. The superv isor reported not considering an extension for the investigation as the supervisor did not believe additional info rmation would change the final finding. The supervisor told OIG investigators that she considered the gastr ointestinal issues, but the mother reported giving the child the laxative and focu sed the investigation on the rep orted dental issues. The supervisor also stated that medical neglect related to the gastrointestinal issues was not appropriate because a medical provider never contacted the Hotline, and the c hild had been discharged from t he hospital during the investigation. Lastly, the supervisor stated if the focus had been on the gastrointestinal issues, she would have considered a DCFS Nurse referral but did not think a nur sing referral was appropriate f or dental care. Four months later, the Department initiated another investigati on after receiving a report that the then 11yearold child and her siblings missed a significant amount of school, and the child could not attend until she had an up-to-date physical. The reporter alleged the then 1 5yearold sibling was not receiving arthritis treatment. The same day of the Hotline report, the child protec tion investigator contacted the school, who confirmed the child and her siblings frequently missed school. The next day, the child protection investigator visited the home, and the mother reported she scheduled a physi cal for the child and gave her herbal supplements for her gastrointes tinal issues. The child protecti on supervisor instructed the child protection investigator to complete a nursing referral, request medical re cords, and ask the children's physicians about possible medical neglect. The child protection investigator con tacted a hospital worker, who stated the adolescent sibling had not received arthritis treatment in in s even months. The child protection investigator also spoke with the child's primary care provider, who reported the child had a history of constipation, was prescribed the over- the-counter laxative, and was referred to a gastroenterologist over six months earlier. The provider did not know if the specialist had seen the child. In the OIG interview, the child protection investigator stated the children's medical providers did not voice a concern regarding medical neglect, but the child protection investigator could not recall specifically asking ab out medical neglect. The child protection investigator told OIG investigators that she did not discuss th e mother's decision to substitute herbal supplements for the prescribed laxative, nor did she interview the gastrointestinal sp ecialist. After speaking with providers, the child protec tion investigator instructed th e mother to immediately ensure the 15yearold sibling received care for her arthritis and all the children ne eded to be seen by the primary care provider. The next week, Department staff requested hospital records, but the hospital reported not having records for the requested timeframe. The investigation was granted an extension after the child protection investigator went on unplanned sick leave, returning to work approximately four mont hs later. The child protection investigator stated in the OIG interview that due to her illness, she was un able to conduct investigative activities, but she attempted to make a DCFS Nurse referral and had difficulty with the electronic submission. A month into the child protection investigator's sick leave, the supervisor was instructed to finish the child protection investigator's 29 pending investigations in the next four weeks , but the supervisor's overtime request for her team was denied. A parallel child protection investigator visit ed the family, and the mother reported she followed through in taking her children to the primary care pro vider, and the doctor changed the 15yearold sibling's treatment to an injection every six months. The child also showed the child protection investigator her herbal supplements and mineral oil for her gastrointestinal iss ues. Citing insufficient evidence, the Department unfounded the mother for medical neglect to the sibling and sub stantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect to the children. In the OIG interview, the supervisor stated she did not add an allegation of medical neglect to the child, because they did not obtain information to support the allegation. The supervisor explai ned the child's doctor reporte d requiring the child to take a laxative and mineral oil, which were not prescriptions, and although there was an is sue with the child taking her medication, there were no reports that this rose to the level of abuse or neglect , and the child's medical providers never reported concerns about medical neglect to the child. However, staff nev er asked the treating physicians about possible medical neglect. Failure to obtain information from the treatin g providers led to child protection staff making the decision about the presence of medical neglect, a decision they do not have the expertise to make. 36 Seven months later, the Departme nt received notification of the child's death after she experienced cardiac arrest during an intestinal perforation surgery. The Department took protective custody of the child's three siblings and placed them with a maternal relative. The assistan t state's attorney rejected the Department's petition for custody, citing the parents had shared custody and there was no prior court involvement that prohibited the children from living with their father. The Depa rtment returned the children to the mother after she agreed to participate in intact family services. During the investigation, the child's surgeon stated the buildup of fecal matter in the bowel caused a perforation and i nfection spread very quickly through her adnominal cavity. The surgeon reported typical treatment for th e child's condition required regular follow up with primary care and specialists and would also include laxati ves and stool softeners. The Department unfounded the mother for death by neglect to the child because the mother brought her to the hospital when she was in pain. The Department did not include a medical neglect a llegation of the child during the investigation. The OIG obtained and reviewed the child's medical records, whic h had not been obtained by Department staff throughout the family's involvement. The medical records showed the mother's history of failing to follow through with the child's recommended medical care, including sp ecialist care and medication regimen. The child protection staff appeared to minimize the risk associated with the child's illness, and investigations into medical neglect can be nuanced and require an expertise to eval uate medical information. Department offers DCFS Nurses as a resource for direct line staff, however child protection staff did not consult the nurses during any of the family's pending inv estigation. DCFS Procedure 300 A ppendix B- #79 Medical Neglect does not include guidance for using DCFS Nurses in investigating allegat ions of medical neglect. There is also limited guidance in completing the CSF 531 DCFS Regional Nurse Referral Form, which does not differentiate between the role of the DCFS Nurse in investigations and placem ent services. The errors in both 2020 child protection investigations highlight the need for the Department to increase guidance and training on when and how to utilize DCFS Nurse referrals in child protection investi gations. After learning of the child's death, the Department placed the primary child protection staff involved in the 2020 child protection investigations on desk duty, which left v acancies in the same field office for over nine months. After tragic events, a r eview of work leading up to the child's death is warranted, but the Department should critically evaluate the use of long-term desk duty so as to not strain direct line staff. The Department is currently experiencing unpreceden ted staffing shortages and pla cing staff on desk duty for long periods of time without review can negatively impact the Department's ability t o respond to reports of abuse and neglect. 1. The Department should discipline the child protection super visor involved in the first 2020 investigation for failing to ensure children were seen at the outset of an investigation and failing to addr ess information in a related information call. The Department agrees. The employee received a 15-day suspensio n. 2. The Department should discipline the child protection invest igator involved in the first 2020 investigation for failing to ensu re children were seen at the o utset of an investigation and failing to address information in a related information call. The Department agrees. The empl oyee received an oral reprimand. 3. The Department should share th is report with the Regional Ad ministrator and DCFS Regional Nurse to facilitate a discussion about the investigations of medical neglect with the child protection staff involved in the 2020 investigations. The discussion should incl ude the use of DCFS Nurses, the importance of obtaining medical records and the need to obtain statements from medical providers about medical neglect. RECOMMENDATIONS 37 The Department agrees. The report has been shared with Child Pr otection Leadership for training purposes. Policy Transmittal 2022.08, P300.100 and CANTS 65-B was issued to staff on September 9, 2022 to inform staff of changes to Procedure 300.100, Medical Requirements for Reports of Child Abuse and Neglect , and the implementation of form CANTS 65-B, Evaluation of Medical Neglect of a Child .

The CFS 351 was shortened and reframed, a nd the Nursing division was granted access to SACWIS, to ensure access to entire case file and complete information. Nursing will document the completed consulta tion and ensuring record is comp lete. A copy of CFS 351 provides specific and separate directions for DCP vs intact and permanency. It i s currently with Office of Child and Family Policy and available upon request. 7. The Department should develop written protocol for the use o f restricted duty status. The Department should review the practice of placing staff on indefinite desk duty after the death of a child and explore the use of increased supportive s upervision in lieu of desk dut y, when appropriate. The Department agrees. The Department is collaborating with sta ff, the union and across divisions to develop a written protocol related to restrictive duty status that will work effectively for various divisions and their respective job assignments. The updated protocol will be releas ed later in FY23. 38 8. As previously recommended in OIG Report2021 IG 0018 (issued June 30, 2021) and agreed to by the Department, the Department should develop a referral form, simi lar to the CANTS 65-A, Referral Form for Medical Evaluation of a Physical Injury to a Child, that is specific to allegations of medical neglect. The OIG reiterates this recommendation and the critical need fo r full implementation. The Department agrees. The report has been shared with Child Pr otection Leadership for training purposes. Policy Transmittal 2022.08, P300.100 and CANTS 65-B was issued to staff on September 9, 2022 to inform staff of changes to Procedure 300.100, Medical Requirements for Reports of Child Abuse and Neglect , and the implementation of form CANTS 65-B, Evaluation of Medical Neglect of a Child . The changes to Procedure 300.100 include action that Child Protection Specialists must t ake with regards to medical evaluations and care when investigating reports of abuse or neglect. The updates to Procedures 300 were reviewed in subregional in-person meetings with Child Pro tection Supervisors, Area Admi nistrators and Regional Administrators. 9. As previously recommended in OIG Report 2021 IG 0018 (issued June 30, 2021) and agreed to by the Department, the Department sho uld amend Procedures 300, Appendi x B, Allegation of Harm #79- Medical Neglect to include the following required activity, \"If a child has special health care needs, as defined in Procedures 302, Appendix O, Referral for Nursing Con sultation Services, the Child Protection Specialist must complete a DCFS nurse referral.\" The OIG reiter ates this recommendation and the critical need for full implementation. The Department agrees. Allegation #79, Medical Neglect is in the process of being revised. 10. Child Protection management should review the death investi gation to determine if a medical neglect allegation for the mother should have been added to the investi gation. The decision to return the children to the mother and not engage the father should also be reviewed . The Department agrees. The investigation was reviewed with the involved child protection staff for training purposes. DEATH AND SERIOUS INJURY INVESTIGATION 12 A 4monthold was discovered by her mother unresponsive and wed ged in between an adult-sized mattress and the wall. The mother called 911, an d a neighbor attempted CPR prior to first responders arriving. An ambulance transported the infant to the hospital, where she was pronounced deceased. The mo ther admitted to smoking mar ijuana and consuming alcohol the night before and placing the infant on her stomach in the adult-sized bed. The mother then laid down next to the infant and fell asleep. The Department indicated the mother for death by neglect. In the four months prior to the infant's death, the mother had an open intact case, a pendi ng child protection investigation, and two unfounded child protection investigations. See Appendix B for th e full report. The infant's mother has an extensive history of child neglect i n a different state, dating back to 2016 due to concerns regarding the mother's ment al health and substance use. In 2019, the infan t's then 3yearold and 4mont hold maternal siblings were placed into that state's foster care system a nd a placement case was opened for the mother. In June 2021, the mother came to Illinois. The Department initi ated an investigation after learning the mother gave birth to the then 2weeko ld infant, the deceased, and had a pending child investigation in the other state. The Illinois child protection investigator contacted the out-of -state child protection worker, who stated the mother had not been cooperating with her placement case service s, and the case was moving towards DEATH INVESTIGATION 39 termination of her parental rights. The out-of-state child prot ection worker also reported the mother tested positive for cocaine in July 2020 and for marijuana in January 2021, and there were serious concerns for the infant's wellbeing and safety due to the mother's drug use and mental health. The Illinois child protection investigator then contacted the mother's out-of-state placement worker, who stated the mother had not been compliant with parenting services, toxicology screenings, visit a t i o n s w i t h h e r c h i l d r e n , a n d c o m p l e t i n g a substance use evaluation. The placement worker stated the mothe r completed a psychological evaluation but did not follow through with mental health treatment and medicat ion. The placement worker stated the infant would have been taken into protective custody if the mother had given birth prior to fleeing to Illinois. The worker added the mother was al so on probation for assault, lead ing the worker to believe this was another reason the mother fled, because she did not want to deliver the infant while in jail. The next day, the Illinois child p rotection investigator locate d the mother and infant at a shelter. The mother told the child protection investigator that she came to Illinoi s because there were no resources to help her in the other state. She confirmed her two older children were in foste r care and said she was unable to complete her services due to transportation issues. The mother reported she completed a psychological evaluation but denied knowing that mental health treatment and medication had been re commended. She admitted to being on probation for assaulting a family member and her probation offi cer did not know that she was in Illinois. The mother reported working with the shelter to obtain stable housi ng. The child protection investigator discussed intact family services with the mother, who agreed to the servi ces. The child protection investigator informed the mother that if she did not cooperate with intact family ser vices, the infant might be taken into protective custody. The child protection supervisor told OIG investigators that they did not take protective custody of the infant because the shelter's staff stated the mother was doing well with the infant, and the mother agreed to cooperate with intact family services. DCFS opened the mother's intact family services case less than two weeks after the Department initiated its investigation and assigned a Department intact worker to the ca se. The intact worker told OIG investigators that he spoke briefly with the mother's out-of-state placement worker but was not provided with substantial information, other than the mother's history of substance use a nd mental health issues. The intact worker added the Illinois child protection investigator did not provide the mother's out-of-state child welfare records; however, the child protection investigator told OIG investigato rs that she requested the out-of-state records but did not receive them prior to the investigation closing. The De partment unfounded the mother for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and wel fare by neglect. The intact staff developed a service plan and tasked the mother with completing random toxicology screenings, engaging in mental health counse ling, and participating in pare nting services. In early July 2021, the intact worker documented the mother was engaged in domestic violence s ervices through the shelter where she was residing, and the mother also asked the intact worker to connec t her to a mental health counselor. A week later, the intact worker returned to the shelter for a s cheduled visit with the mother and the then 7weekold infant, but shelter staff informed the worker that t he mother left the shelter with the infant several days prior. The Department initiated a second child protection investigation as the mother left the shelter without notifying her intact worker nor informing the worker of the newborn's whereabouts. At that time, the intact case had been open for three weeks. A child protection i nvestigator spoke to the intact worker, who found the infant with her maternal g randfather. The grandfather repor ted to the intact worker that the mother left the infant with him, the mother had been gone for a day, and he did not know her whereabouts. However, the grandfather later admitted to the child protection investigator that he lied to the intact worker and that the mother was arrested and in jail. The grandfather stated he retrieved t he newborn from jail, expressing to the child protection investigator that he wanted to care for the infant. The child protection investigator observed the infant to appear healthy and had no signs of abuse or neglect. The inf ant was assessed as safe and the child protection investigator's supervisor documen ted that there was no informat ion to suggest the mother could not be around the infan t, as mother \"allegedly dropped off the infan tand then turned herself into jail.\" However, two months 40 later, the child protection investigator received police report s of the incident, stating the mother was arrested for domestic battery involving anot her woman, and the infant wa s present during the incident. The next day, the grandfather called the child protection inves tigator, requesting assistance as the mother was released from jail and at his home, demanding to have the infan t. The child protection investigator arrived at the home and observed the mother screaming at the grandfather a nd police were present. The child protection investigator spoke with the mother, who stated the grandfather kicked her out of the home and would not allow her to take the infant. The child protection investigator spoke with the mother about what would be best for the infant, as she had no plans for where she would go, and the mot her agreed to allow the infant to remain with the grandfather for the weekend. The child protection investiga tor completed an oral toxicology with the mother, which was negative for a ll substances. The child protec tion investigator's supervisor instructed the child protection investigator to re-request the mother's out-of -state child welfare rec ords to determine if protective custody should be taken. The child protection invest igator told OIG investigators that it took over a month to receive the documents, as there were barriers in obtai ning out-of-state records. In mid-July 2021, four days afte r the second inv estigation was initiated, the intact worker met with the mother at a motel where she was staying. The mother reported the infan t would remain with the grandfather until the mother was able to obtain stable employment and housing. Howeve r, the mother called the intact worker the next evening and stated the grandf ather returned the then 8wee kold infant to the mother. The intact worker went to the hotel to observe infant, and the mother stated she had been placing the infant to sleep in her car seat, as the grandfather had the infant's bedding. The mother refused when the intact worker offered to provide her with a pack-and-play, stating she just wanted to get the pack-a nd-play back from the grandfather. The intact worker discussed safe sleep prac tices again, and the mother den ied she allowed the infant to sleep in her bed with her. The intact worker retrieved the pack-and-play from th e grandfather, brought it to the mother, and asked if she needed anything else, to which the mother replied she did not need anything. However, an hour later, the out-of-state placement worker notified the intact wo rker that during an online visit between the mother and her two older children, the placement worker observed the m other feeding the infant water, and the mother explained to the placement worker that she was out of formula. The Department initiated a third investigation after the Hotlin e received a report that the mother ran out of formula for her 9weekold infant and had no plans to obtain ad ditional formula. The reporter stated it was unclear when the infant was last provided substantial food, as the mother disclosed that she was feeding the child water and Pedialyte until she also ran out of Pedialyte. The reporter expressed there were ongoing concerns regarding the mother and stated t he child may need to be taken into protective custody. An on-call child protection investigator contacted the intact w orker, who reported the mother received WIC, but she had not made her appointments due t o transportation iss ues. The worker added he offered to drive her, but the mother refused. The on-call child protection investigat or met with the mother at the motel and provided her with formula, distilled wate r, diapers, and clothing. The c hild protection investigator prepared a bottle as the mother set up the pack-and-play, as it was still in the box from when the intact worker delivered it earlier that day. The mother reported sh e did not tell the intact worke r she need formula because she did not want to get into trouble. The child prot ection investigator explained t hat the intact services were in place to support the mother so she could maintain custody of her infant. The child p rotection investigator updated her supervisor, and they assessed the infant as safe; however, the supervisor d ocumented the infant was screaming upon the child protection investigator's arrival and was \"clearly hungry and immediately took a bottle.\" The on-call child protection investigator told OIG investigators that she did not ask the mother how long the infant had been without formula. The second child protection investigator was assigned to this t hird investigation as the second investigation was pending. The intact worker contacted the child protection inves tigator as he had received a message from the mother, stating she needed assistance as she was unable to pay for the motel room. The worker attempted to 41 contact the mother and the maternal grandfather to locate the i nfant, but no one responded. In early August 2021, the intact worker, child protection investigator, and the ir supervisors met to discuss the mother's case. After leaving the motel, the mother moved into a different shel ter, but that shelter evicte d her six days later due to her lack of participation in required classes. The mother mo ved back into the original shelter that she lived at when her intact family servi ces case opened seven weeks prio r. The following week, the child pro tection investigator and intac t worker met with the mother, who agreed to comply with anger management, homemaker services, and parenting classes. The mother reported she was engaging in counseling and domestic violence services through t he shelter. The intact worker directed the mother to have the shelter workers contact him to confirm she w as engaging in the services, and during each weekly visit, he reminded the mother to follow up on this. In e arly September 2021, the intact worker confronted the mother about her lack of progress with her intact services and discussed the possib ility that the shelter may ask her to leave if she was not engaging in services. The worke r also completed a CERAP, identified no safety threats, and assessed the 3monthold infant as safe. The next week, the intact supervisor directed the worker to staff the case with the state's attorney's office due to the mother's lack of cooperation. The mother stopped responding to the intact worker, despite the worker's continued efforts, and service providers also reported to the worker that they had not hear d from the mother. The intact worker and supervisor met again with the child protection investigator and supe rvisor, and reported the mother was about to be dismissed from the shelter due to noncompliance. The child protection investigator and supervi sor told OIG investigators in separate interviews that alt hough the mother was not cooperating, there was no urgent or immediate threat identified to justify taking protective custody of the infant. The child prot ection supervisor and int act worker both spoke of challenges with court referrals in their interviews with OIG, a nd it was reported the court was dealing with an especially high number of cases and referrals. In mid-September 2021, the mother responded to the child protec tion investigator's ongoing attempts to contact her. The child protection investigator transported the mother a nd infant for a wellness exam at a prompt care, and the doctor identified no concerns regarding the infant, inc luding her weight. The following week, the Department unfounded the mother for inadequate food and closed the third investigation. The mother's second investigation remained open, as the child protection investigat or had not received the out-of-state child welfare records. The intact worker documented a dditional attempts to contact the mother, but she did not respond. Two days before the child's d eath, the mother res ponded to the intact wo rker, sending a text message that she was out of town. The worker requested to sch edule a visit for the followin g week so that he could see the infant, but the mother did not respond. The Department closed the second investigation a month after th e infant's death. The mother was indicated for substantial risk of physical inj ury/environment injurious to he alth and welfare by neglect. 1.

DEATH AND SERIOUS INJURY INVESTIGATION 13 During the OIG's review of compla ints and child deaths from FY 20 through FY 22, the OIG identified a systemic pattern of child protection inves tigations with significant delays in child protection investigators making ini tial contact with the child(ren) in response to a Hotline call. Department Rule re quires in-person contact with t he alleged child victim within 24 hours of the report to the State Central Regis ter. According to Department P rocedure, when contact with alleged child victims is not made within 24 hours, good faith attempts must b e made every 24 hours or sooner, including weekends and holidays, until the alleged child victim is seen, unless a waiver is granted by the child protection supervisor. DCFS Procedure 300.50(c) provides requirements for seeing children at the outset of the investigation. See Appendix A for the full report. OIG investigators identified 24 child protection investigations in which the child protection investigators and their supervisors failed to assess the safety of the alleged child victims in a timely manner. The timeframes of these delay s ranged from just under a month to over 100 days before contact was made with the child(ren), leaving alleg ed victims of child abuse /neglect in unassessed INVESTIGATION ISSUE 43 and potentially unsafe situations. The OIG's review found the d elay in seeing children occurred throughout the state in investigations of both abuse and neglect allegations. The OIG found that attempts after the initial mandate occurred because of a precipitating event such as the i nvestigation reached the 60-day mark, the Department received related information, or a child died. The O IG's review also revealed high percentages of delay in seeing children in inv estigations involving our most v ulnerable youth: Eleven of the 24 (46%) investigations involved children under 1 year old. Twenty of the 24 (83%) investigations involved children 3 years and under, and Twenty-two of the 24 (92%) investigations involved children 5 y ears and under. Procedurally, the importance of s eeing children is evident thro ugh the extensive guidelines set forth in Procedures 300. Procedure 300.50(c), Initiation of the Investigation , requires that \"the safety of all alleged child victims must be assessed before an investigation is considered initiated\" and that the child protection specialist shall take whatever steps are necessary to obtain the current l ocation of the alleged ch ild victims and proceed immediately to their location. Good faith attempts must be made every 24 hours or sooner, including weekends and holidays, until the alleged child victim is seen, unless a waiver is granted by the Child Protection Supervisor. Procedures note that, \"the fact that a good faith attempt was m ade and that the 24-hour mandate was technically met does not relieve the Child Protection Specialist of the res ponsibility for continuing to attempt to establish in-person contact with the alle ged child victim as soon as poss ible.\" A common barrier to seeing children can often be difficulty in locating the family. As such, the Department provides both procedural requirements and guidance in using too ls to locate families. Few child protection investigators documented using a diligent search or the Integra ted Eligibility System (IES), the State of Illinois's computer based public benefits application and manag ement system. In addition, using schools and daycares as a resource to locate the family were often not util ized until later in the investigations, if at all. Police were also not called to request w ell-child checks in the event the investigator was unable to make contact with the family. The Department has resources such as all shift aler ts and on-call workers, but these were rarely utilized. Although, in many of the c hild protection investigati ons supervisors routinely instructed investigators to continue making attempts, these directives were rarely follo wed and did not include a plan or strategy to eliminate barriers to seeing the children. The investigations reviewed by the OIG are a small sample of th e total number of child protection investigations completed and may not be representative of all investigations; however, this sample c overed all geographic regions, indicating it could be a s tatewide issue, highlighting the need for Departmental review. 1. The Department should review the current status of children that have not been seen in child protection investigations within a week of the Hotline call and develop a plan to ensure that the safety o f the children has been immediately assessed. The Department agrees. In June 2022, to ensure that children br ought to the attention of the Department are seen and contact is documented timely in SACWIS, the Department , in collaboration with the Department of Innovation and Technology (DOIT) created an interactive dashboa rd using analytics software (PowerBI). The dashboard is updated daily and provides data to the field at th e statewide, regional, sub-regional, team and individual worker levels. 2. Department Administration must develop a plan to ensure that more efficient efforts are made to meet with alleged child victims at the inception of the investigatio n. The Department agrees. In June 2022, to ensure that children br ought to the attention of the Department are seen and contact is documented timely in SACWIS, the Department , in collaboration with the Department of RECOMMENDATIONS 44 Innovation and Technology (DOIT) created an interactive dashboa rd using analytics software (PowerBI). The dashboard is updated daily and provides data to the field at th e statewide, regional, sub-regional, team and individual worker levels. 3. The OIG reiterates the previous recommendation from 2021 IG 0069, that the Department should increase the number of Emergency Services workers available for after-hours and on weekends to ensure that children are being seen in a timely manner. The Department agrees. The issue has been addressed with the im plementation of the interactive dashboard. In addition, weekend blitzes are utilized to address child victims that have not been seen and child protection supervisors have the ability to utilize additional staff after hours as needed. 4. The OIG reiterates the prev ious recommendation from 2013 IG 1109, that if child protection investigators cannot meet their obligation to assess child(ren) in a timely manner the supervisor should assure that the police are contacted for a welfare check. The Department agrees. In June 2022, to ensure that children br ought to the attention of the Department are seen and contact is documented timely in SACWIS, the Department , in collaboration with the Department of Innovation and Technology (DOIT) created an interactive dashboa rd using analytics software (PowerBI). The dashboard is updated daily and provides data to the field at th e statewide, regional, sub-regional, team and individual worker levels. 45 PART II: CHILD DEATH REPORT Pursuant to Illinois Register at 89 Ill. Admin. Code 430, the I nspector General investigates deaths or serious injuries in foster homes, child welfare institutions, independe nt living programs and other facilities licensed by the Department, as well as deaths or serious injuries when t here was an open child welfare service case or child protection investigation by the Department within the preceding 12 months. The death of a child is always tragic. For that reason, the OIG uses deaths as a milest one to review the Department's involvement with that family. The OIG review is based upon the work even be yond the contributory path to the death. Problems not truly connected to the death could come to light. A death is not always a reflection of errors on the part of Department or private agency workers. OIG staff receive notification of the death of a child mainly f rom the Illinois State Central Register (SCR). This year the OIG learned, from the Child Death Review Team, of additional deaths that had not been reported to SCR. OIG staff investigate the Department's prior i nvolvement with the deceased and their family when (1) the child was a youth in the care of DCFS withi n a year of their death; (2) the family is the subject of an open investigation or service case at the time of the child's death; or (3) the family was the subject of an investigation or service case closed within the p receding 12 months. Notification of a child's death initiates an investigatory revi ew of records. OIG investigators review the death reports and information available through the Department' s computerized records. The investigator then obtains additional records, including the child's death ce rtificate and autopsy reports when available. Records may be requested, impounde d, or subpoenaed. The majorit y of cases involve an investigatory review of DCFS and privat e agency case records. Those reviews which identify mal feasance or misfeasance of Depa rtment and private agency employees, as well as systemic problems and errors, may move to a full inv estigation. The issues identified may or may not relate to the death itself. As part of a full investigation , additional records - often including social service, medical, police, and school records - may be requested and interviews conducted. A full investigation may result in a r eport to the Director of DCFS. When issues identified in multip le cases indicate systemic patt erns the OIG makes recommendations to the Director to address systemic issues through a variety of means. These include systemic issue reports, initiatives, and trainings. OIG investigations from this fiscal year are being incorporated into Error Reduction Training plans to be presented to the Director in 202 3. This year OIG investigators found several child protection investigations i n which the alleged child vict ims were not seen in accordance with procedures 300 and therefore, were not assessing the safety of alleged child victims. In Fiscal Year 2022, OIG investigators completed an investigato ry review of 171 deaths of children who died between July 1, 2021, and J une 30, 2022. A d escription of each child's death and DCFS involvement is included in this Annual Report. OIG investigators determined 37 deaths required full investigations. One systemic report included 13 deaths addressing a systemic concer n. Comprehensive summaries of death investigations reported to the Director in FY 2022, which may i nclude deaths that occurred in earlier fiscal years, are included in Part I: D eath and Serious Injuries Inves tigations. Of the 171 child deaths reviewed by OIG, the Department conduct ed a child protection investigation for allegations of death by abuse or neglect in 97 (57%) of the dea ths. Of those 97 deaths, the Department indicated a perpetrator for death by abuse or neglect in 43 dea ths (44%) and unfounded an alleged perpetrator for death by abuse or neglect in 44 (45%) deaths; 1 0 child protection death investigations (10%) remain pending at the time of this report. Of the 97 deaths inv estigated by the Department for death by abuse or neglect, 18 of the deaths were ruled homicide in manne r, 17 had an undetermined manner, 30 had 46 a manner of accident, and 28 had a manner of natural. Autopsy r esults have not been released for four of these deaths.

The first part of the summary presents child d eaths by age and manner of death , case status and manne r of death, county and manner of death, and child protection death investigations by result and manner. The second part presents a summary of deaths classified in five manners: homici de, suicide, undetermined, accident, and natural. This year there are five deaths for which autopsy resu lts have not yet been released and thus this report has a list of deaths classified under a pending classifi cation section. Please note that the term \"coroner\" is used for both coroners and the Cook County Medical Examiner in the individual summaries. Key for Case Status at the time of OIG investigation (see Table 2) Youth in Care Deceased was a Youth in Care. Unfounded DCP Family had an unfounded child protection investigation within a year of child's death. Pending DCP Family was involved in a pending child protection investigation at time of child's death.

He was pronounced deceased at the sc ene. The day before, t he teen's father had filed a missing person report after he did not return home from mowing a lawn and did not respond to phone calls. An unrelated person has been charged with his murd er and is awaiting trial. DCFS did not investigate the teen's death. Reason for Review: The teen and his siblings had previously been removed from and returned to their father's care. In April 2021, DCFS opened an investigation foll owing a report that the father had been drinking, smoking marijuana, and driving while intoxicated with children in the car. The reporter also stated the teen had mental health issues, was using drugs, and was stealing, and the father failed to address these problems. The teen admitted to stealing marijuana from hi s sister a few weeks prior but denied using other drugs. The father reported using marijuana but denied cur rent use of alcohol or other drugs; he reported a history of drug use and treatment. He denied providi ng any drugs to the teen. The teen, his then 6yearold sister, and his then 5yearold brother all denied p hysical punishment and appeared clean and healthy. The children's childcare provider, the father's recove ry group sponsor, and staff from their primary care provider's office all denied concerns regarding th e father's parenting. In June 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physical in jury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Child No. 2 DOB: 06/2020 DOD: 07/2021 Homicide Age at death: 13 months Cause of death: Asphyxia due to wedging between a bed and wall; significant contributing conditions of melatonin ingesti on and general neglect by caregi ver(s) Alleged perpetrator: Child's mothe r Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Oneyearold was found unresponsive by his mother between the wall and a twin bed he shared with his sibling. The toddler was transported by ambulan ce to the hospital, where he was pronounced deceased. His mother reported she found him unrespon sive at 10:00am but paramedics were not dispatched until 11:38am. She reported she left the childre n with a babysitter around 11:00pm the previous evening, but the babysitter lived in the apartment nex t door, and she knew the babysitter was not staying in the home. The mother reported she checked on the chi ldren around 11:45 pm. The babysitter reported checking on the children around 12:30am and stated she believed the mother returned around 2:00am. DCFS indicated the mother for death by neglect. A crimi nal investigation was also conducted but the mother was not arrested. Reason for Review: In June 2021, DCFS received a report that the home was dirty, the mother did not change the toddler's diapers, and the mother often left a 10ye arold child to watch the toddler, his 22monthold, 3yearold, and 5yearold siblings when she left t h e h o m e . T h e c h i l d p r o t e c t i o n investigator (CPI) met with the family at home the following da y and observed no environmental hazards and the children appeared healthy, clean, and appropriately dre ssed. The mother reported she never left 54 her children unsupervised and the maternal aunt, who was at the home at the time of the interview, often watched the children. The mother declined services. Four days b efore the toddler's death, DCFS unfounded the investigation for environmental neglect and inade quate supervision. Child No. 3 DOB: 10/2007 DOD: 09/2021 Homicide Age at death: 13 years Cause of death: Gunshot wound of the back Alleged perpetrator: Child's brothe r Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Thirteenyearold was shot by hi s 17yearold brother. The mot her stated she heard the boys arguing in their room while playing video games; she heard the shouting escalate, and the brother told her he shot the teen. The brother called 911, and the moth er began CPR. The teen was pronounced deceased at the hospital. The mot her stated she did not know th e gun was in the home. P olice arrested the brother for unlawful use of a weapon. The brother stated he and his brother were eating at the time and were not fighting. He stated h e did not know the gun was loaded . He stated he was not under the influence of any drugs at the time of the incident. The mother later stat ed she did not hear arguing prior to the shooting. The State's Attorney determined the shooting was acci dental. DCFS investigated the teen's death and indicated the teen's brother for death by abuse. Reason for Review: In April 2021, DCFS received a report that the teen's then 16 yearold brother disclosed he had been sexually abused by their cousin four year s earlier while the cousin lived in the home. The brother later disclosed he had molested the teen. The broth er was receiving inpatient psychiatric treatment at the time of the report, and the parents stated the y planned for the teen to stay with relatives when the brother was discharged from the hospital. The parents also stated the cousin had moved out of the home and did not have access to the teen or his brother. Du ring a forensic interview, the brother denied his earlier disclosures and stated he had been intoxicated when he reported the abuse. The teen and other family members denied any sexual abuse. That same day, the moth er disclosed a history of domestic violence in the home, and DCFS added allegations to the investi gation. In July 2021, DCFS unfounded the allegations of sexual molest ation by abuse and substantial risk of sexual abuse. DCFS also unfounded the allegation of substantial ri sk of physical injury/environme nt injurious to health and welfare by abuse because neither the teen nor brother had any signs of abuse, an d the parents and brother reported only one domestic violence incident. Child No. 4 DOB: 03/2004 DOD: 09/2021 Homicide Age at death: 17 years Cause of death: Multiple gunshot wounds Alleged perpetrator: Unknown Reason for review: Open intact family services case at time of child's death; indicated child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Seventeenyearold was walking on the sidewalk of the street w here he lived when a vehicle pulled up behind him, tw o unidentified individuals got out, ran after the teen, and fired multiple shots at him. The teen was tra nsported to the hospital by ambul ance and underwent surgery, but he died at the hospital. DCFS did not investigate the teen's death. Reason for Review: At the time of his death, the teen lived with his mother, four adult siblings, and three nephews, who were children of his 21yearold sister and were between the ages of 1 to 3 years. In August 2020, DCFS received a repor t that the teen's sister was not feeding her then 10monthold and 1yearold children, the children often begged for food, and th ey appeared underweight. The reporter also 55 stated screaming and crying could be heard from the home, which was often unsanitary. The next day, the CPI observed unsafe conditions in the home, including mice drop pings on kitchen surfaces, flies around open garbage in the kitchen, and holes in the walls. The childr en did not have any injuries. The sister stated her children ate regul arly, and denied ex cessive noise, screami ng, and crying. She stat ed they clean daily, including mopping and sweeping, and their landlord would exterm inate the mice. The sister stated she was pregnant. The teen, his mother, and his brothers also denied th e allegations in the report and stated they had no concerns about the childre n's care. The children were te mporarily placed with their father under a safety plan due to the home conditions. One week later, the CPI observed the home to be in better condition, but an exterminator had not yet come to the home and the holes in the walls had not been fixed. The property manager stated the apartments are typically exterm inated once per month or as needed, but the family's home was always dirty and had food all over. The f amily hired an exterminator who treated the home that weekend. Later that month, the sister gave birth to a third son. The sister had safe sleeping arrangements for her children. In October 2020, DCFS indicated the teen's sister for environmental neglect to her children. DCFS opened an intact family services case for the sister. The intact worker met with the teen several times and observed him to be free of visible signs of abuse or neglect. At the time of his death, the teen was not in school because he had been expelled from mu ltiple schools because of poor attendance. The sister's intact case has since closed successfully. Child No. 5 DOB: 03/2004 DOD: 09/2021 Homicide Age at death: 17 years Cause of death: Gunshot wound of the head Alleged perpetrator: Unrelated persons Reason for review: Two unfounded child protection investigation s within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Seventeenyearold and a male p eer were found early in the mor ning in a parked vehicle with gunshot wounds to their heads. They were airlifted to hosp itals for treatment. The teen died at the hospital later that morning. Two adults and a 16yearold were arrested on charges of firstdegree murder, and an arrest warrant was issued for another suspect. DCFS did not investigate the teen's death. Reason for Review: In August 2020, DCFS received a report that the teen disclosed physical abuse by her relative adoptive mother, had bruises all over her body, ha d been sexually assaulted by her adoptive cousin, and had run away from home. The teen's adoptive mother also reported the teen was on run. The CPI located the teen at her biological mother's home and did no t observe any marks or bruises on the teen. The teen denied being abused, but she did not want to return to her adoptive home. The CPI called in a crisis worker to arrange for a shelter placement for the teen. The teen eventually returned to her adoptive home, and the CPI made a referral to a DHS-funded program to wo rk with the family. In September 2020, the investigation was unfounded. In November 2020, DCFS receive d another report that the teen ran away to her biological mother's home and would not return. Police st ated they could not assist. The adoptive mother stated she saw a video of the teen fighting a peer at sc hool on social media and alleged the teen's biological mother contacted the peer's mother to facilitate the fight. The teen denied the fight was planned, and the teen's biological mother and grandmother denied involve ment in the fight. The teen stated she was no longer speaking to her adoptive mother and had recently been staying at her biological grandmother's home. In February 2021, DCFS unfou nded the investigation. The a doption unit and the family's youth advocate were notified of the adoption disruption. The adoption unit advised the teen's biological grandmother should be provided with information on obtaining gu ardianship. 56 Child No. 6 DOB: 05/2021 DOD: 10/2021 Homicide Age at death: 4 months Cause of death: Multiple injuries due to child abuse Alleged perpetrator: Child's fathe r Reason for review: Indicated child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Included in syste mic issue report; report to Dire ctor June 30, 2022 See Death and Serious Injury Investigation 13 Narrative: Fourmonthold was brought to the hospital by her father afte r she was found unresponsive by a family friend. She was not breathing upon arr ival and was pronounced deceased at the hospital. The infant's body had m ultiple injuries, including sk ull and rib fractures; soft tissue hemorrhages and healing abrasions to her head, neck, torso, and all extremi ties; extensive injuries to her central nervous system and eyes; and a hepatic hematoma. The infant was in the care of her father at the time of her death, and medical staff stated the infant died four to six hours befo re she was brought for medical care. DCFS investigated and unfounded the family friend. DCFS indicated th e father for death by abuse. Law enforcement has a criminal case pending against the father. Reason for Review: In February 2021, DCFS received a report that the father's the n paramour brought her 4yearold child to the hospital for a rash and hair loss; hospital staff observed bruises on the child's back, chest, neck, and ear; the paramour could not explain the injuries; and the child's toxicology report was positive for THC, nicotine, and caffeine. The hospital took protective custody of the child. DCFS placed him initially with a mentor of the paramour, then with h is father. The paramour denied smoking around or injuring her son, and stated she believed the marks o n his body were caused by a skin condition. The child stated the infant's father caused the marks on his bo dy, and his mother did not hurt him. Medical providers treating the child stated they did not believe the ma rks were caused by his rash. The State's Attorney declined to accept the case. The paramour agreed to pa rticipate in voluntary intact family services. The CPI attempted to interview the infant's father, w ho stated he no longer lived in the state, but he made an appointment to meet w ith the CPI when he would be in the area again. He failed to attend the appointment or to return messages. In June 2021, DCFS indicated the infant's father for cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse and neglect and su bstance misuse by neglect. DCFS unfounded the father's paramour. The father was not involved in the param our's intact family services case. Child No. 7 DOB: 03/2019 DOD: 10/2021 Homicide Age at death: 2 years Cause of death: Multiple injuries due to child abuse Alleged perpetrator: Child's mother and mother's paramou r Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twoyearold was brought to the hospital by her mother with mu ltiple head traumas, abrasions, scabs, scars, strangulation marks around her neck, a nd thermal injuries to her hands. The mother told hospital staff that she found the toddler unresponsive in her bed. She left the toddler with her paramour the previous day and reported that the toddler tried to grab th e hot stove, then fell and hit her head. The injuries were at different stag es of healing and consistent wit h child abuse. The mothe r and her paramour were arrested and charged with homicide. A criminal case remain s pending. DCFS indicated the mother and paramour for deat h by abuse. DCFS also indicated the mother for head injuries by abuse; wounds by abuse; and cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse. Reason for Review: In August 2021, DCFS received a report that the mother's param our beat the toddler with a belt on her back while the mother stood by; the toddler was often made to kneel down and carry heavy objects, and had weight added to the load or was hi t with a belt if she dropped the objects; and the home had a mold infestation, inadequate utilities, and was in poor condition. The CPI made multiple unsuccessful attempts t o locate and contact the family . During one attempt, a man at the address 57 identified himself as a new tenant and reported he did not know the family who had moved out. The investigation remained pending at the time of the child's death . After the death, DCFS indicated the investigation for substantial ri sk of physical injury/environme nt injurious to health and welfare by abuse and by neglect, and unfounded the investigation for inadequate shelter and environmental neglect. Child No. 8 DOB: 07/2004 DOD: 10/2021 Homicide Age at death: 17 years Cause of death: Multiple gunshot wounds Alleged perpetrator: Unknown Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Included in syste mic issue report; report to Dire ctor June 30, 2022 See Death and Serious Injury Investigation 13 Narrative: Seventeenyearold was shot 14 times in the street. He was bro ught to the hospital in full arrest and pronounced deceased. Police have not identified a su spect. DCFS did not investigate his death for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: In November 2020, DCFS received a report that the family home had no electricity or heat, and there were unsecured guns on the table within reach of children. The CPI made a good faith attempt to see the child ren at home that day, sent a letter to the home, and made a second good faith attempt approximately three weeks after the investigation opened. In late December, the CPI learned the teen was detained in a juvenile detention facility and met with the family at their home. The home was observed to have electricity, h eat, and food. The teen's nephew s, who were present but did not live in the home, reported they had never seen guns in the home or in their grandfather's home. Collateral contacts also reported they had never seen guns in the home. The CPI spo ke with the teen and teen's juvenile delinquency case manager, who reported he was being detained fo r a weapons charge. In January 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigation for inadequate food and substa ntial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Child No. 9 DOB: 02/2004 DOD: 10/2021 Homicide Age at death: 17 years Cause of death: Gunshot wound to abdomen Alleged perpetrator: Teen's boyfriend Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Seventeenyearold was pronoun ced deceased at the hospital wit h a single gunshot wound to the stomach. A reporter stated the teen's boyfriend came to the home, made threats, and attempted to get into the home, but the teen closed the door to prevent him from coming in. The boyfriend shot a single bullet through the door, which hit the teen and killed her. The teen's aunt stated she was aware of the relationship but did not condone it, and the teen would often s neak out to meet up with her boyfriend. DCFS did not investigate the teen's death for abuse or neglect. The police did not arrest the boyfriend and no charges were filed. Reason for Review: The teen lived with her aunt since the age of 3 years. In Janu ary 2021, police arrested the teen's 26yearold boyfriend for domestic battery after responding to a domestic violence call at a hotel. DCFS opened an investigation into the teen's boyfri end. The teen's aunt stated the teen often did not listen and did what she wanted. The aunt stated she kne w the teen was in a relationship but had not met the teen's boyfriend. The boyfriend stated the teen tol d him she was 18 years old, and the teen admitted to lying about her age. DCFS unfounded the investigati on due to insufficient evidence because the teen's boyfriend was not an eligible perpetrato r, as he was not in a caretaker role. 58 Child No. 10 DOB: 10/2007 DOD: 11/2021 Homicide Age at death: 14 years Cause of death: Multiple gunshot wounds Alleged perpetrator: Unknown Reason for review: Open intact family services case and pending child protection investigation; and indicated child protection investigation within one year of chi ld's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fourteenyearold was shot and killed while standing on a side w a l k a b l o c k f r o m h i s home. The teen's mother reporte d the teen was on his way home f rom the store and stated she believed it was a case of mistaken identity. She denied the teen was involv ed in a gang. DCFS did not investigate the teen's death. Reason for Review: The teen had five siblings, between the ages of 4 and 15 years . In December 2020, DCFS opened an intact family services case after the parents we re indicated for environmental neglect and the mother was indicated for inadequate food. At the transi tional visit for the intact case, the home was noted to require repairs but was considered safe. Recommend ed services included parenting education, counseling, and a developmental assessment for the y oungest child. The mother reported struggling since the death of her mother, who had been a signif icant source of support for the family and had died after the teen's maternal uncle was shot and killed. D uring another visit that month, the intact worker observed ample food in the home, the children did not sh ow signs of abuse or neglect, and the father reported he continued to w ork on home repairs. In Januar y 2021, the mother reported there was an electrical fire on the back porch and the home was damaged, but no one was injured. The intact worker shared information on housing ser vices but the mother reported it would be more cost effective to make repairs to the home. In February 2021, the father began parenti ng classes. In March 2021, the mother began therapy. That month, DCFS opened an investigation after t he intact worker observed a red mark on the cheek of the teen's then 10 yearold sister and hand of the 9yearold sister. The mother admitted she used a phone charger cord to hit the sisters on their hands for failing to clean their room, and the cord accidentally hit the 10yearold in the face. The CPI met with the father in the home, who reported he was in another part of the home when the incident happened. The CPI directed the parents to take the 10yearold for a medical exam. In May 2021, the CPI returned t o the family home and observed the 4yearold brother had a scratch and bruise on his forehead. Th e mother explained that he fell off the porch, while he was unsupervised. The CPI directed the parents to take the brother for a medical exam, and the treating physician repor ted no concerns. DCFS indicated the mother for cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse; inadequate supervision; and substantial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. The mot her agreed to continue to cooperate with intact services. In June 2021, the mother completed parenting c lasses successfully and she was making progress in therapy, but it was reported she may benefit from a psychiatric evaluation. The father was incarcerated for outstanding gun charges. During the summer, th e 9yearold and 10yearold sisters went to stay with relatives out of state and the teen attended summe r school regularly. In August 2021, the sisters stated they wished to stay with the relatives, who agre ed to continue caring for them. The intact worker completed shortterm guardianship paperwork for the sist ers. In September 2021, the father was released from jail on house arrest and reported he no longer wi shed to participate in DCFS services. The parents reported they were no longer romantically involved but the father would continue to remain in the home until he completed his house arrest. In November 2021, the father moved out of the home and the mother reported the teen's 4yea rold brother went to live with a relative who also had guardianship of the teen's 15yearold sister. The morning of the teen's death, DCF S received a report that the mother had abandoned the home leaving the teen alone for multiple weeks. T he reporter also alleged the teen was selling drugs, the teen's younger siblings were missing, and th e home had been shot at multiple times. A CPI met with the mother and teen at the home that day and obser ved multiple safety hazards, including broken windows, garbage and clutter throughout the home, and mo ld and water damage to the walls and ceiling. The mother denied leavi ng the children home alone, rep orted the teen's siblings were living with 59 relatives, and denied the home had been shot at but acknowledge d that there had been shootings in the neighborhood. The teen refused to speak with the CPI. The teen was shot and killed that evening. Two days later, the mother was shot and killed on her way to light a candle where the teen had been shot. DCFS later unfounded the investigati on for inadequate supervision an d substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. The intact case remained open, and the intact worker provided information on obtaining guardianship to the relatives who were caring for the teen's siblings. Child No. 11 DOB: 09/2003 DOD: 11/2021 Homicide Age at death: 18 years Cause of death: Gunshot wound of the chest Alleged perpetrator: Unknown Reason for review: Deceased was a youth in care Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Eighteenyearold was shot five times by an unknown assailant while sitting in a car with his girlfriend. The teen was taken to the hospital, where he di ed. DCFS did not investigate the teen's death. Reason for Review: At the age of 11, the teen's great-grandmother was awarded sub sidized guardianship. In 2017, juvenile d elinquency court ordered the t een into DCFS custody because of his behavioral issues and criminal activity. The teen was released from juvenile detention to a court ordered institutional placement for behavioral problems. He was release d back to his grandmother's home for a few months in 2018, before being detained by law enforcement an d again placed in juvenile detention. He was court ordered to inpatient substance use disorder treatment in 2019. After being discharged from inpatient treatment, he returne d to his grandmother's home. In 2021, he was arrested and charged with aggravated discharge of a firearm and unlawful use of a weapon. He was adjudicated and placed in detention. In September 2021, the teen was released from detent ion with an electronic ankle monitor to the home of his father. The teen's DCFS placement worker attemp ted to visit the teen at his father's home multiple times without success prior to his death. Child No. 12 DOB: 03/2016 DOD: 12/2021 Homicide Child Homicide Age at death: 5 years; 7 years Cause of death: Gunshot wound of the head; gunshot wounds of th e head and back Alleged perpetrator: Unrelated person Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation and siblings returned home within one year of children's deaths Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fiveyearold, sevenyearold, and their father were found in their father's home, with gunshot wounds to the back of their heads. The boys were visiti ng their father. Police arrested a man for all three murders, who stated he worked for the father selling marijuana and owed the father a large sum of money. DCFS did not investigate the children's deaths. Reason for Review: The boys' maternal grandparents had been their legal guardians for the five years preceding their death. In March 2020, DCFS took protective cust ody of the boys' then 1yearold sister. In April 2020, DCFS also took protective custody of their infan t brother following his birth. Both parents engaged with services through their placement case. In Septembe r 2020, the mother began unsupervised visits and in November 2020, the f ather began unsupervised visi ts. In November 2020, the court returned the infant brother and 1yearold sister to their mother's care and ordered six months of aftercare services; six months later, in May 2021, the court returned custody of th e infant and 1yearold to their parents. In March 2021, DCFS received a report that the mother witnessed th e maternal grandparents' dog bite the 60 5yearold close to the eye while on a video call and she had s een the dog bite the 7yearold in the past. The maternal grandparents and the boys told the CPI that the do g did bite the 5yearold, but he had cornered the dog, and his grandparents had told him not to do s o several times. The grandparents took the 5yearold for medical attention, and the treating physician st ated his injury was consistent with the report. The 5yearold did not report any abuse or concerns with his gr andparents. In April 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigation. Child No. 14 DOB: 04/2021 DOD: 12/2021 Homicide Age at death: 7 months Cause of death: Craniocerebral injuries due to blunt force tra uma Alleged perpetrator: Unknown Reason for review: Open intact family services case at time of child's death; indicated child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sevenmonthold found unresponsive on a sofa by his paternal a unt, who called 911. The infant was transported to the hospital by ambulance, where he w as pronounced deceased. An autopsy revealed multiple brain bleeds and skull fractures. A DCFS inve stigation and criminal investigation into the infant's death remain pending. Reason for Review: In October 2020, DCFS opened an intact family services case fo llowing an unfounded child protection investigation. Initial services incl uded a mental health assessment for the mother and parenting classes for both parents. The intact worke r observed a packandplay for the infant's then 7monthold brother that was being used as storage and ins tructed the parents to clean it so it could be used for sleeping. At the time, the mother was pregnant with the infant and was encouraged to obtain prenatal care. The intact worker continued to make regular visi ts. In November 2020, DCFS received a report that law enforcement res ponded to a domestic disturbance at the home, in which the mother threatened to harm herself and the then 9monthold brother. Re sponding officers reported the incident was a verbal altercation and they petitioned to have the mother involuntarily admitted for a psychiatric evaluation. The mother was hospitalized and later discharged to a family member. The father stated the mother threatened him and the brother when he returned home fro m buying diapers. The mother denied the allegations. After the incident, the father brought the bro ther to the home of the paternal grandmother, who had an order of protection against the mother due to prior incidents. The father agreed not to allow the mother around the brother until she received further assess ment. The CPI provided a packandplay and the brother was assessed safe with his father in the patern al grandmother's home. Two weeks after the Hotline report, the paternal gra ndmother reported the father le ft several days earlier and she did not know where he went. She continued to care for the brother. The CPI s creened the case with the State's Attorney, who declined to accept the case. In December 2020, the mother w as not participating in services. The mother reported that she was compliant with her psychotropic me dication. The father reported he had been staying with a friend since he left the paternal grandmother's home. Both parents agreed to comply with services and to keep the brother in the care of his paternal gr andmother until they began services. In January 2021, DCFS indicated the mother for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. In February 2021, the family's i ntact worker reported the parents had begun parenting classes, and the mother was receiving prenatal care a nd mental health services. In April 2021, the mother gave birth to the infant. The infant lived with his parents and his then 1yearold brother continued to live with their pat ernal grandmother and visit wit h his parents. In August 2021, the parents successfully completed parenting services and the infant's pedi atrician reported he was developing appropriately. In September 2021, the infant's brother began ha ving extended visits with the parents. In October 2021, the parents began receiving services from a home visiting program to assist them in meeting the children's needs. Three weeks before the infant's death, th e intact worker discussed closing the intact case with the parents. The following day, the father and the ch ildren left to stay with the paternal 61 grandmother after the father said he found the children home al one and the mother outside looking for him. He stated the mother became upset and told him to leave an d threatened to harm herself. The intact worker called 911 for a wellness check and law enforcement repo rted no concerns. The intact worker visited the paternal grandmothe r's home, provided pack-and-play s for the children, and the father signed a safety plan that the children w ould not return to their mothe r's care. The intact worker provided the mother with a bus pass and instru cted her to obtain a mental he alth assessment. Five days before the infant's death, the father repor ted he planned to keep the chil dren with their paternal grandmother and did not plan to return to the mother's home. Child No. 15 DOB: 06/2009 DOD: 01/2022 Homicide Age at death: 12 years Cause of death: Gunshot wound of the ches t Alleged perpetrator: Unrelated person Reason for review: Two pending child protection investigations at time of child's death; three unfounded child protection inves tigation within one year of chi ld's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twelve-yearold was found by his family after he was shot in t he chest. The teen had been playing video games with his 13 yearold sister and a friend of the teen's 16yearold brother, who had a handgun. The friend allegedly re moved the magazine from the gun , pointed it at the teen, and pulled the trigger. Other family members h eard the shot, f ound the teen un responsive, and calle d 911. The teen was transported by ambulance to the hospital, where he was pronounc ed deceased. The family friend left the scene before police arrived and was later located and arrested; he has been charged with murder. The father did not live in the home and was not present at the time of the incident. The mother was asleep at the time of the incident and stated she did not know the friend was in the home. DCFS investigated the teen's death and unfounded his mother for death by neglect. Reason for Review: In January 2021, DCFS received reports that the teen's then 21 yearold sister whipped her 4yearold child with a cord, left him home alone f or several hours, and used drugs. The reporter added that the child burned himself because his mother was not adequately supervising him. That day, the CPI met with the sister at home, who denied the allega tions. She admitted to using alcohol and marijuana on occasion but denied other drug use. The child was observed to have a scar on one arm from being burned by water, but no other signs of injury. He denied his mother hit him with any objects and denied being afraid of her. Fam ily members also denied the alle gations and stated they believed the teen's 20yearold brother called the Hotline because of family discor d. During the investigation, the sister submitted a negative toxicology screening. In February 2021, wh ile the investigation was pending, DCFS received a report that the siste r was neglecting the nephew, bu t the Hotline worker noted the reporter was agitated, threatened to physically harm the sister, and used fo ul language. The Hotline worker contacted police for a child welfare check. In March 2021, while the firs t investigation remained pending, DCFS received a report that the teen's mother left the then 11year old teen and his then 9yearold and 16yearold brothers home alone without making a care plan, the teen had called the reporter and requested they be picked up because the mo ther was drunk and stated she w ould kill them, and there was domestic violence in the home. DCFS opened separate investigations again st the teen's parents. The next day, the CPI met with the family and the children denied their parents f ought. The parents each denied the allegations. Family members again stated they believed the teen 's 20yearold brother called the Hotline. Police reported there had been no service calls to the home for domestic violence. Later that month, DCFS unfounded the investigation against the sister for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by abuse, burns by neglect, and inadequat e supervision. DCFS also unfounded the investigations against the mother and the father for substantia l risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. In October 2021, DC F S r e c e i v e d a r e p o r t t h a t t h e t e e n ' s 20yearold brother had molested and penetrated the teen's 13y earold sister, and the teen's mother knew 62 of the incident; the teen's 5yearold nephew and 8yearold br other had recently been left home alone; the teen's 20yearold brother and 21yearold sister had knock ed over a pot of boiling water during an argument, which burned the teen's 8yearold brother, and the b rother did not receive medical treatment; and the mother and 20yearold brother sold cocaine and the fam ily used drugs in the home. DCFS opened an investigation against the mo ther and 20yearold brother, an d a separate investigation against the teen's 21yearold sister. That day, the CPI made a good faith attempt to see the family. Tw o days later, the CPI spoke with the children through th e window, but the mother was not home, and they declined to open the door. One week later, the CPI saw the teen's 5yearold nephew, 8yearold brother, and 12yearold sister at school and noted the children had no visible bruises or burn s. The children denied being abused and stated they felt safe at home. In December 2021, the teen's 12 yearold sister and 8yearold brother completed forensic interviews. Neither child disclosed any abus e, and both stated they felt safe at home. Law enforcement interv iewed the mother, who denied the allegati ons. The mother stated she believed the girlfriend of the 20yearold brother called the Hotline becaus e she was upset with him. The investigations remained pending at the time of the teen's death. DCFS later un founded the investigation against the mother and 20yearold brother for sexual penetration; substant ial risk of burns by neglect; inadequate supervision; environm ental neglect; and risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfar e by neglect. DCFS unfounded the investigation against the teen's sister for inadequate supervision. Child No. 16 DOB: 11/2020 DOD: 01/2022 Homicide Age at death: Overdose of fentanyl Alleged perpetrator: Child's fathe r Reason for review: Indicated child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Thirteenmonthold began choking while eating, and 911 was cal led. The father stated the toddler began making faces as if she were hurt, then closed her eyes and would not wake up. The toddler's paternal grandmother attempted CP R before paramedics arrived. T he toddler was taken to the hospital by ambulance, where she was pronounced deceased. The toddler had b een at her paternal grandparents' home overnight. Her mother had also s pent the night, though she did not live in the home, and she left for work approximately three hours before the toddler's death. The fathe r stated the toddler had a fever and the mother had given the toddler overthecounter cough and cold me dication before leaving for work. The treating physician at the hospita l observed no blockages in the toddler's throat. An autopsy and toxicology screening revealed the toddler was positive for fentanyl. The f ather has been charged with endangering the life of a child causing death. DCFS investigated the toddle r's death and indicated her father for death by neglect; her mother was removed as a subject of the investig ation because she was not in the home at the time of the death. Reason for Review: In December 2020, DCFS received a report that the toddler's um bilical cord tested positive for cocaine and hydromorphone upon her birth bu t had no signs of withdrawal. The mother had told the reporter she had been prescribed hydromorphone for pain a few days before the toddler's birth. The CPI documented the mother denied a history of drug u se and stated the positive reading was because she had touched cocaine while spending time with associ ates that used drugs. The then 2weekold was placed with her pat ernal grandmother unde r a safety plan. T he mother agreed to complete toxicology screenings, participate in a substance use screening, adhere to all recommendations, and have supervised visits. The paternal grandmother agreed to the safety plan and denied knowledge that the mother used drugs. The mother completed substance abuse and mental health a ssessments, and no services were recommended. In January 2021, th e mother had completed four uri ne toxicology screenings, all of which were negative, and the safety plan was terminated. Later that m onth, hospital staff confirmed the mother received hydromorphone at the hospital but had tested positive for cocaine two months before the birth 63 and tested positive for marijuana four months before the birth and stated she planned to cease using drugs. Hospital staff had no concerns for abuse or neglect and reporte d the mother was appropriate during appointments. DCFS indicated the m other for substance misuse by neglect.

Three days earlier, his mother reported him missing. The child had reportedly been in t he care of his 16yearold sister, who admitted to drinking alcohol and falling asleep while caring fo r the child. DCFS opened an investigation. When the child's body was found, it was reported he died one we ek earlier. The child's mother, 17yearold brother, and 20yea rold brother have been arrested for criminal charges related to his death. DCFS indicated the child's mother for death by abuse and substa ntial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Reason for Review: A case was opened in 2014 due t o concerns of domestic violence , substance use, and mental health. Four childre n were in substitute care and th ree children were placed with their father. The mother successfully complet ed services, and the children we re returned to her care in August 2017. In May 2021, DCFS received a repor t that the then 5yearold ch ild's mother sent text messages in which she threatened the child; called the child, his 6yearold sist er, and his 11yearold brother derogatory names; stated she would not continue to raise them; the mother and had a history of substance use including during her last two pregnancies; and the then 5-y ear-old child was the size of a 3yea rold. The CPI made a good faith attempt to see the family that night. The followin g day, the CPI contacted the mother by phone, who refused to provide her current address. The mother e ventually provided her address, which was in a different county than reported, and the CPI visited th e family at home. The mother stated she had recently moved because she wanted a fresh start and denied the allegations. She reported she was on dialysis and denied using drugs or drinking heavily in recent y ears. She stated she lost custody of her children in 2014 and had worked hard to have them returned. The mother reported she believed the father of her youngest three children made allegations against her bec ause she did not allow him to see the children. The CPI observed the child and five siblings, ages 4 to 17, and noted the children appeared well. The deceased child was observed to be small for his age. In Jun e 2021, another CPI met with the mother and the child's teen and adult siblings and noted the siblings spoke well of their mother but were concerned about her health. Later that month, DCFS unfounded the investig ation for substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to health and welfare by abuse and by neg lect. Child No. 18 DOB: 09/2019 DOD: 02/2022 Homicide Age at death: 2 years Cause of death: Blunt force trauma due to physical abuse Alleged perpetrator: Child's fathe r Reason for review: Return home w ithin one year of child's death Action taken: Full investigation pending Narrative: Twoyearold was found unresponsive, and 911 was called. First responders reported they found the toddler with bruises and injuries on multiple planes of her body. She was transported to the hospital, where she was pronounced deceased. The father stated the toddler had urinated on the couch, so he whipped her with a belt, washed her, noticed she was having trouble walking, and heard a thump when 64 she fell down. Both the father a nd paramour also reported he ha d whipped her the day before. The paramour stated that after she felt just spanking her wasn't wo rking, she gave the fa ther a belt to use. At autopsy, the pathologist found injuries on almost every area of her body consistent with child abuse. The toddler had been living with her father for approximately one m onth after the mother became homeless. The toddler's siblings were living with their respective father s. The father has been charged with first degree murder and DCFS indicated the father for death by abuse; head injuries by abuse; internal injuries by abuse; and cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injurie s by abuse. DCFS investigated the mother and unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physica l injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect because she made appropriate care plans with her children's fa thers. Reason for Review: The toddler and her three siblings came into DCFS care in 2020 , after a shooting at their mother's home. In Marc h 2021, the toddler's mother beg an receiving unsupervised visits with the then 17monthold toddler and he r then 2yearold, 5yearold, and 6yearold siblings. In May 2021, the 5yearold brother returned to the mother's care. In June 2021, the toddler and her 2yearold and 6yearold siblings returned home as well. The caseworker conti nued to visit the home over the next month. At her final visit, the caseworker documented the verbal children felt safe at home and the home was observed to be clean and free of visible safety concerns. I n July 2021, the court ordered the children's placement case closed, and terminated DCFS' custody of the chil dren. The fath er came into the toddler's life after the DCFS case was cl osed and was not involved with t he mother during her DCFS case. Child No. 19 DOB: 03/2005 DOD: 02/2022 Homicide Age at death: 16 years Cause of death: Stab wound of the back Alleged perpetrator: Unrelated pee r Reason for review: Child was a youth in care; two pending child protections investigations at time of child's death; indicated child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sixteenyearold and his twin brother were involved in an alte rcation during which a peer stabbed the teen in the back. A peer has been criminally charge d in connection with the death. DCFS did not investigate the teen's d eath for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: In November 2021, DCFS received a report that law enforcement had received multiple calls about the family and the teen's father kicked th e teen and his twin brother out of the home due to their aggressive behavior. The father wanted them arrest ed because they kicked in the door after he locked them out of the home. The CPI met with the twins at the home, and they could not identify any family members to stay with. DCFS took protective custody of th e twins. Their 13yearold sister remained in their father's care. The court ordered the twins to be place d with their father under a supervision order. In December 2021, DCFS indicated the father for abandonment/des ertion, inadequate supervision, and substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to he alth and welfare by abuse. Nine days later, DCFS received a report that the twins reported their father mis sing. DCFS opened an investigation but did not remove the twins from the home because they had just been p laced there by a court order and they were old enough to stay home alone. While the previous investig ation was pending, DCFS received a report that the father had left the home the previous day and h ad not returned. DCFS opened an additional investigation. In January 2022, the twins were removed from the ir father's home and placed with fictive kin. The father denied leaving the twins home alone, without fo od. When asked about the teen's 13yearold sister, the father stated she was not part of the c ase, and she lived with relatives. The twins were enrolled in school and refe rred for individual therapy and anger management services. They reported they wanted to return to their father's home and missed their s ister. In February 2022, the twins' foster mother informed their placement worker that while she was at wo rk the previous night, unknown individuals went to her home and engaged in an altercation with the twins. The foster mother reported the 65 twin brother had been hit multiple times with a metal object bu t did not require medical care. The placement worker instructed her to seek medical attention for t he teen. Four days later, the foster mother reported the teen had been stabbed. Both investigations remaine d pending at the time of the teen's death. DCFS later indicated the father on both investigations for inad equate supervision. Child No. 20 DOB: 07/2020 DOD: 02/2022 Homicide Age at death: 19 months Cause of death: Blunt force injuries of the head Alleged perpetrator: Paramour of child's fathe r Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death Action taken: Full investigati on; report to Director in FY 2023 Narrative: Nineteenmonthold was found unresponsive and bleeding from th e mouth while in the care of her father's paramour. The paramour called 911 and firs t responders reported the toddler was cold to the touch, did not have a pulse, and had significant bruisin g to her face and torso. The toddler was transported to the hospital by ambulance. Two days later, she w as pronounced deceased. The paramour has been charged with murder as well as aggravated battery to a child related to the child protection investigation that was pending at the time of t he toddler's dea th. The criminal case remains pending. The DCFS investigation into the toddler's death remains pending. Reason for Review: In January 2022, DCFS received a report that after visiting he r father's home, the toddler had bruises on her face and buttocks, abrasions on her lip, and a possible buckle fracture on her left arm. Hospital staff reported the mother told them the fath er's explanation of the injuries had changed multiple times. The toddler was discharged to the care of her m other. The next day, the CPI interviewed the mother at her home. The mother reported the toddler was vis iting her father's home; the father's paramour, who was caring for the children while the father was at work, texted her that the toddler had been injured as she was standing behind the door with a sippy c up when the toddler's paternal halfbrother and the paramour's nephew ran in side, and the door hit the todd ler. The CPI advised the mother not to send the toddler to her father's home until DCFS could assess; the mother agreed. The CPI took photos of the toddler's injuries. Later that day, the CPI interviewed the toddler's 12yearold paternal sister, who was not present for the incident, but reported she felt safe in the father's home. The 5- and 8yearold halfsiblings reported the toddl er was standing by the door and got hit by the front door on the face while they and their friend were running in and out. They said their father was at work during the incident, and the paramour called the mother. The father reported he was at w ork when the incident happened but heard the same explanation. He stated he noticed the toddler had a br uise and was not using her arm as much as normal, and he shared that information with the mother. He stat ed the toddler had also fallen off a bed. He denied that he or his paramour used corporal punishment. The pa ramour reported that the boys knocked the toddler over, but she did not know if she was actually hit by the door, and she had been telling the boys to stop running in and out. She reported she contacted the moth er and sent her photos as soon as the toddler calmed down, and she did not notice any issues with the toddler 's arm until the following day. She denied they used corporal punishment. Approximately two weeks after th e investigation opened, the CPI reported the mother contacted her and sta ted the father had been asking for the toddler to visit. The CPI advised the mother it was her decision as long as the mother believed the t oddler would be safe. The investigation remained pending at the time of the toddler's death. DCFS later indicated the father and his paramour for cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse. 66 Child No. 21 DOB: 09/2015 DOD: 02/2022 Homicide Age at death: 6 years Cause of death: Multiple injuries due to assaul t Alleged perpetrator: Paramour of child's mothe r Reason for review: Indicated child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sixyearold died at the hosp ital four days after being found unresponsive. The mother stated the child had abdominal pain and vomiting; he fell, hit his head, and became unresponsive. The child required intubation, and a CT scan revealed he had multip le brain bleeds. He was observed to have extensive bruising on his legs, buttocks, hips, and torso, as w ell as a small abrasion on his neck and various scars on his feet and legs. The 8- and 9yearold sisters discl osed the paramour beat the child because he did not complete his homework. The mother was not home at the t ime. The paramour was arrested after he turned himself in and admitted to hitting the child and slam ming his head into a wall. The mother reported the paramour had been abusive in the past. DCFS invest igated the child's death and indicated his mother's paramour of death by a buse; head injuries by abuse; an d cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse; and substantial risk of physical injury/envi ronment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. DCFS indicated his mother for death by neglect; head i njuries by neglect; cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by neglect; and substantial risk o f physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Reason for Review: In September 2021, DCFS received a report that the mother's pa ramour beat the child and his two siblings, and police had been to the home num erous times. The mother and her paramour denied any domestic violence to the CPI. The child and his sibl ings did not report any concerns. The mother stated she believed the maternal grandparents called the Hotline as retaliation because she no longer allowed them to watch the children. The children's fathe r was incarcerated. In November 2021, the maternal grandfather stated he wa s concerned about the children and the mother; he believed the paramour beat the mother and sold drugs out of the home, the mother had blocked him from contacting the children, and he had called police to conduct wellbeing checks on the chi ldren. The CPI interviewed the children at school. The 8yearold sister reported she got whipped on the b ottom when she got in trouble, the paramour hit the mother a lot, police had been to the home, and she had to call police at least once. She was observed to have old scars on her arm. The 6yearold child reported he got placed in time out when he got in trouble, he denied he had seen his mother and the paramour argu e, and he denied police had been to the home. The 9yearold sister repor ted she was grounded when she got in trouble, she denied she had seen her mother and the paramour fight, and she denied anyone hit he r. She stated police had been to the home to check on her and her siblings. She was also observed to have old scars on her arms. The CPI met with the mother who reported she was no longer in a relationship wit h the paramour. She denied any domestic violence and denied she or the paramour had ever hit the childr en. In December 2021, DCFS indicated the investigation with the rationale that one child disclosed the m other and paramour fought in front of the children. Child No. 22 DOB: 03/2022 DOD: 03/2022 Homicide Age at death: 0 days Cause of death: Prematurity due t o maternal blunt force injury due to assault Alleged perpetrator: Child's fathe r Reason for review: Open placement case and pending child protec tion investigation at time of child's death; two indicated child protection investigations within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Newborn's mother presented at t he hospital to seek treatment f or her injuries following a domestic violence incident with the newborn's father. Hospital staff confirmed the mother was 25 to 26 67 weeks pregnant and performed an emergency csection. The newbor n died approximately 20 minutes after her birth. The parents had a history of domestic violence and d rug use, the newborn's older siblings had been removed from their care, and the parents did not engage in recommended services. The father has been charged with aggravated batte ry to a pregnant person and m urder. DCFS investigated the newborn's death and indicated the father fo r death by abuse and the mothe r for death by neglect. Reason for Review: The newborn's older siblings, then ages 3, 4, and 6 years old, had been placed with their maternal grandparents since 2020. In May 2021, DCFS received a report that the mother gave birth at home, had three other children in DCFS care due to dom estic violence, and the parents had engaged in a physical altercation one week earlier. The family's casewo rker stated she knew the mother was pregnant and due in June 2021; t he mother denied she was still in a relationship with the father. The caseworker called the mother who reported a friend was driving her out of state, and she had the baby with her. The next day, the Area Administrator determined the case w ould be screened with the State's Attorney. Two days later, the mother reported she had returned to Illinois, but neither the CPI nor the police could locate her. The court granted DCFS temporary custo dy of the baby, and a child protection warrant was issued for the infant. In June 2021, DCFS indicated the investigation for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. One week later, the mother and baby were found, and the baby w as admitted to the NICU. Two wee ks later, the baby was discharged into foster care. In July DCFS opened an investigation on the grandp arents. The children were removed after the grandfather tested positive for cocaine. In January 2022, t he placement worker documented recommended services included substance use assessment, domesti c violence services, and parenting classes but the parents had only engaged in services sporadical ly and the mother experienced housing instability. The 8yearold sister refused visits with her pare nts, but the mother had visits with the other children. In February 2022, DCFS opened an investigation after receiving a report that the children's maternal grandparents used corporal punishment when the childre n had been placed with them. The investigation remained pending at the time of the newborn's bir th and death. DCFS later indicated the maternal grandparents for substantial risk of physical injury/e nvironment injurious to health and welfare by abuse. Child No. 23 DOB: 06/2015 DOD: 03/2022 Homicide Age at death: 6 years Cause of death: Multiple gunshot wounds to the head and ches t Alleged perpetrator: Child's fathe r Reason for review: Indicated child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sixyearold and his mother were shot by the child's father, w ho then shot and killed himself. The child was pronounced deceased at the sc ene. Two da ys later, his mother died at the hospital. DCFS did not investigate the child's death. Reason for Review: In June 2021, DCFS received a report that the child witnessed his father attack his mother, resulting in her being injured. The CPI observed th e child with no signs of maltreatment. He stated the incident was not the first time he had seen his fath er punch his mother. The mother admitted she and the father had a long histo ry of unreported domestic violen ce, she was afraid of the father, and the child had witnessed a domestic altercation. The father admitted to a verbal altercation but denied a physical altercation and stated he would never harm the m other in front of the child. The father refused to provide his location during the investigation. At case closure, the par ents were not living together. The child stated he did not see his father, but spoke to him sometimes, and he f elt safe with his mother and maternal grandparents. The mother reporte d the father moved out of state . DCFS indicated the father for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and wel fare by neglect and unfounded the child's mother for the same allegation. The family declined intact serv ices. 68 Child No. 24 DOB: 11/2020 DOD: 03/2022 Homicide Age at death: 16 months Cause of death: Complications of multiple injuries due to child abuse Alleged perpetrator: Ch ild's mother and fathe r Reason for review: Child was a youth in care; indicated child p rotection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sixteenmonthold died at the hospital. Approximately one year earlier, he sustained head injuries from which he did not r ecover. He remained comatose an d was eventually discharged from the hospital into a longterm care facility. Police arrested the mo ther. DCFS investigated the toddler's death and indicated the parents for death by abuse, head injuries by abuse, bone fractures by abuse, and substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to h ealth and welfare by neglect. Reason for Review: In March 2021, DCFS received a report that the then 4monthol d toddler was brought to the hospital with a potentially lifethreatening hea d injury. The mother told hospital staff he appeared sweaty and was shaking after feeding, so she attempted CPR and called 911. Medical imaging revealed the toddler had bilateral subdural hemorrhages in his brain, numerous intraretinal hemorrhages and a diffuse anoxic brain injury due to oxygen loss, which med ical staff suspected was caused by abuse. The parents denied knowing what happened and the doctor stated the injury could have happened some time before symptoms appeared. Th e father stated that five days earlier, the toddler w as crying more than usual, was vomiting, and constipated. The mother called his ped iatrician and was told his condition, absent a fever, did not necessitate a visit and the parents should giv e the toddler a laxative. The father stated the infant continued to vomit and crie d when he moved, as if he was in pain. He stated th at three days before the report, they brought the toddler to the emergency room, whe re medical staff performed tests and discharged him. He stated the toddler continued vomiting but se emed to be improving. The CPI initiated a safety plan with the toddler's then 2yearold brother to be placed with his relatives. Additionally medical staff found the toddler to have multiple fractures which doctor s opined were caused by a forceful back and forth movement of the back and neck. Physicians reported the to ddler would remain comatose and the parents needed to decide about continuation or removal of care as the toddler could not breathe or eat on his own and required a trach and gtube to be placed. The paren ts decided on continued care. The court granted DCFS temporary custody of the toddler and his brother. The brother remained with relatives. Later that month, DCFS indicated the parents for head injuries by abu se; bone fractures by abuse; and substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and wel fare by neglect. In August 2021, the then was placed in a longterm care facility. In December 2021, the toddler was admitted to the hospital for respiratory issues. In February 2022, the parents signed a do n ot resuscitate order. Child No. 25 DOB: 12/2013 DOD: 03/2022 Homicide Age at death: 8 years Cause of death: Failure to thrive due to chronic malnutrition d ue to physical neglect and abuse Alleged perpetrator: Ch ild's mother and fathe r Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death; unfounded child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Full investigation pending Narrative: Eightyearold was found cold and unresponsive by his mother, who reported she checked on him around 2:00pm having not seen him since he went to bed a round 8:00pm the night before. The mother reported she put the child in a warm bath, began CPR, an d called 911. The child was transported to the hospital, where he was pronounced deceased several hours later. At autopsy, the child's body showed signs of starvation over multiple months as well as phys ical abuse. DCFS investigated the child's death and indicated the parents for death by abuse; torture; cu ts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse; tying /close confinement by abuse; failu re to thrive; and substantial risk of physical injury/ 69 environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. The par ents have been charged with murder and are awaiting trial. Reason for Review: In 2017, the court granted guardianship of the child and his b rother to their paternal grandmother after they had been removed from their par ents. In August 2021, DCFS received a report that the paternal grandmother had allowed the child's 11 yearold brother to st ay with his parents for the past year, because of the brother hurting the child. Th e grandmother had also left the child with his parents one month prior, when she had to travel for a family ma tter. When the grandm other returned, the parents refused to return the child to her care. The grandmothe r called police who informed the grandmother she would need to i nvolve family court. The grandmo ther expressed concerns about the parents' ability to care for the children long term because of the parents' history of drug use and physical aggression toward the children. The CPI spoke with the grandmot her, who verified the narrative but stated she did not want the children b ack. The CPI made multiple attem pts to locate the family. The State's Attorney advised the CPI to work with police and make every eff ort to locate the family before a protective warrant could be requested. The father contacted the CPI and sa id they had moved out of state and refused to cooperate with DCFS or the police. The State's Attorney refu sed to send any court orders. The child protection supervisor waived the daily attempts to see the chil dren and noted that DCFS obtained earlier court orders that stated the parents had been deemed fit in 201 5, therefore the case would be closed due to misinformation. DCFS unfounded the investigation for environmen tal neglect. In February 2022, DCFS received a report with multiple c oncerns including domestic vio lence, substance use and child abuse and neglect. The child protection supervisor confirmed the children were not enrolled in school. The father reported the children were not in school because he did not hav e legal guardianship but denied all other allegations. The father reported they returned to Illinois one month earlier and attempted to establish guardianship. DCFS later received a related information allegin g the mother refused to open the door for DCFS because the child had two bl ack eyes. Eventually, the CPI met with the children. The brother reported he felt safe at home and stated he had lived with his parents for a few years because his grandmother did not want him, he did not miss going to school b ut would be okay with going back. He denied anyone hurt him or his brother. The CPI noted the child was thin and small in stature; the child stated he ate often but did not gain weight. He stated he felt safe at home and did not want to return to his grandmother's home. The parents stated they had not been able t o take him to a doctor because they did not have guardianship. The children were assessed as safe and i ntact services were discussed. In March 2022, the paternal grandmother agreed to sign temporary guardia nship paperwork. The CPI again offered the parents intact services who stated they would consider them . The investigation remained pending at the time of the death and temporary guardianship had not been f inalized. DCFS later indicated the investigation against the parents. Child No. 26 DOB: 05/2003 DOD: 04/2022 Homicide Age at death: 18 years Cause of death: Gunshot wound of head Alleged perpetrator: Unknown Reason for review: Deceased was a youth in care Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Eighteenyearold was shot and killed in his apartment. He was pronounced deceased by responding paramedics. The teen liv ed alone at th e time of his death. Police have made no arrests. DCFS did not investigate the teen's death for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: The teen came into DCFS care at 15 years old, after he was adm itted to a psychiatric hospital for physi cal aggression and continued to e xhibit aggressive behaviors in the hospital, and his parents refused to pick him up. In the year before his death, the teen was working and began living in his own apartment through an independent living program for youth in care. In February 2022, the teen's placement worker learned the teen was behind in rent and bills. His caseworker completed multiple 70 applications to assist him with funds to prevent eviction. The next month, he moved to a transitional living program. His caseworker last met with him and spoke to him in t he week before his death. Child No. 27 DOB: 07/2004 DOD: 04/2022 Homicide Age at death: 17 years Cause of death: Gunshot wound of head Alleged perpetrator: Unknown Reason for review: Child was a youth in care and parent of a yo uth in care; one indicated and one unfounded child protection inves tigation within one year of chi ld's death Action taken: Full investigation pending Narrative: Seventeenyearold was driving her car when an unknown vehicle approached and fired shots in her direction. The teen was taken to the hospital, whe re she later died of her injuries. DCFS did not investigate the teen's death. Reason for Review: In September 2020, DCFS obtained temporary custody of the teen and the teen's then newborn child after the teen had run away from home, given birth, and refused to live with her mother. The teen refused to meet with t he CPI. In December 2020, DCFS r eceived a report that the teen's mother was using drugs, allowed a man to live in the home and have a r elationship with the then 16yearold teen. The CPI met with the teen's mothe r who reported the teen met he r 22yearold paramour the year before, she did not learn of the relationship until the teen was pregna nt. The mother and other relatives reported they did not know where the mother lived. In February 2021, the CPI reached the teen by phone. The teen reported she was living with her paramour but refused to provid e an address or meet with the CPI. In March 2021, the teen's mother contacted the CPI to report the t een was at her home along with her paramour. Police took the teen into custody after a domestic vi olence incident with the paramour. The teen was placed in an emergency shelter for six days, then placed wi th her maternal aunt. One week later, the maternal aunt reported the teen ran away with the paramour. In June 2021, DCFS indicated the paramour for sexual penetration. The alle gations against the teen's moth er were unfounded. The teen was indicated for substantial risk to her child. In July 2021, the teen's pla cement worker learned the teen was living in an unauthorized placement with a nother aunt and learned there w as a warrant out for the aunt's arrest. Later that month, the teen informed her caseworker she was livi ng with her mother. In August 2021, the court changed the teen's perma nency goal to independence. In Ma rch 2022, after multiple failed attempts to meet with the teen, the court recommended the permanency goa l for the teen's child to be changed to substitute care pending termination of parental rights. Child No. 28 DOB: 08/2005 DOD: 04/2022 Homicide Age at death: 16 years Cause of death: Gunshot wound of the head Alleged perpetrator: Unknown Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sixteenyearold was found with a gunshot wound to his head an d was transported to the hospital, where he was pronounced deceased. No arrests have bee n made. DCFS did not investigate the teen's death. Reason for Review: In October 2021, DCFS received a report that the teen presente d at the hospital with a gunshot wound to his leg, a nd hospital staff were unable to contact the teen's grandmother, with whom he lived. That day, the CPI spoke to the grandmother, who reported a relative was on the way to pick the teen up from the hospital. At the hospital, the teen r eported a bullet grazed his back but said he did not know who shot him. He sta ted he felt safe with his gran dmother. Two days later, the CPI met with the family. The grandmother reported she was commuting to work by public transit when she learned of 71 the incident and arranged for a relative to pick the teen up at the hospital. The teen reported there had been a shooting in the neighborhood and he had been in the wrong pla ce at the wrong time. The teen's 14yearold brother also reporte d feeling safe with the grandmo ther. In December 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigation for inadequate supervision because the grandm other immediately arranged for an adult family member to meet the teen at the hospital. Child No. 29 DOB: 10/2001 DOD: 04/2022 Homicide Age at death: 20 years Cause of death: Multiple gunshot wounds Alleged perpetrator: Unrelated person Reason for review: Deceased was a youth in care; pending child protection investigation at time of deceased's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twentyyearold entered a bar with intent to rob the patrons. The youth displayed a gun and an armed customer shot him multiple times. Emergency respon ders were unable to resuscitate the youth and he was pronounced deceased at the scene. At the time of his death, the youth was on electronic monitoring, but had been on run from his placement since Decemb er 2021. DCFS did not investigate his death. Reason for Review: The youth came into DCFS care in September 2015 at the age of 13, after DCFS took protective custody because his maternal greatgrandmother refused to pick him up from the hospital. Between 2015 and 2022, the youth often went on run and had mult iple placements. He was ultimately placed in a transitional living facility and his goal was indep endence. However, the youth was uncooperative with services. In 2 021 the youth was diagnosed wi th fluid around his heart and experienced a minor stroke. The placement file documented his health issues were a result of marijuana use. The youth did not follow through with his medical appointments. The youth maintained two jobs, reported weekly visits with his 4yearold da ughter and regular visits with his mother and maternal greatgrandmother but often chose unauthorized placeme nts. His placement worker docum ented regular attempts to contact the youth. Her last contact with him happened approximately six wee ks before his death, while he was in the hospital due to his cardiac issues. In August 2021, DCFS receiv ed a report that another youth in care was being paid by staff at the yout h's transitional living facility to oversee other residents in the program, including the deceased youth. The CPI interviewed residents, wh o denied being placed in caretaking roles and reported staff were always present. In October 2021, the CP I interviewed the youth, whose report corroborated other residents' reports. The investigation remain ed pending at the time of the youth's death. The investigation was later unf ounded for inadequate supervisio n. Child No. 30 DOB: 12/2007 DOD: 05/2022 Homicide Age at death: 14 years Cause of death: Gunshot wound of neck Alleged perpetrator: Unrelated person Reason for review: Child was a youth in care; one indicated and one unfounded child protection investigations within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fourteenyearold was shot in th e neck during an alleged attem pted robbery, with two other teenagers. He was transported to the hospital. Six days l ater, the teen was pronounced brain dead. The following day, he was removed from life support and died. D CFS did not investigate the teen's death for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: The teen came into DCFS care in 2018, at 10 years old, and was placed in a group home. In June 2021, DCFS received a report that the teen and hi s then 14yearold brother broke into their 72 mother's apartment and caused extensive damage leaving the apar tment uninhabitable. The teen was arrested and released later that month. DCFS took the report as information only. In July 2021, the teen was arrested for robbing cars in a hotel parking lot. Upon his arrest, police found heroin and cannabis on him. In September 2021, the teen w as released fro m juvenile det ention on probation. The teen repeatedly went on run from his group home. In January 2022, the teen was arrested in another state for driving a stolen vehicle and fleeing police. He was detained, but charges were dropped. The teen was returned to Illinois. The teen continued to go on run. The teen was eventua lly placed with his paternal grandmother. The grandmother later requested his removal after he threatened to shoot her. The teen ran from the grandmother's home and went to his mother's home as an unauthor ized placement. That month, the placement worker identified an out of state secured residential placement for the t een, who was placed on their waiting list. Two days late r, DCFS received a report that the mother called police after an argument, the teen left, and she no longer wanted him in her home. The te en denied he ran away and stated he had been on the home's back porch. DCFS unfounded the investigation for lock out. The teen reported he wished to stay in his mother's home and refused to sign paperwo rk for the out of state placement. Later that month, the mother reported the teen had stolen money and e xpressed concern about the teen's behavior and disregard for rules. Three weeks before the teen's death, p lacement options were discussed at a child and family team meeting. The worke r made plans to continue disc ussions in another meeting in June 2022. The teen died before the second meeting. Child No. 31 DOB: 12/2019 DOD: 05/2022 Homicide Age at death: 2 years Cause of death: Multiple blunt injuries of the abdomen and ches t Alleged perpetrator: Paramour of child's mothe r Reason for review: Child was a y outh in care and was the child of a youth in care; one indicated and one unfounded child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twoyearold was found unresponsive by her 20yearold mother, who had gone to wake her when a case aide arrived to transport the toddler to daycar e following an overnight visit in the mother's home. The case aide called 911 and the toddler was transported by ambulance to the hospital, where she was pronounced deceased upon arriva l. The mother's 5weekold i nfant had been allowed to remain in her care. The mother's paramour, the newborn's father, was on p robation for assault a nd was not allowed to be around the children. The mother admitted she had allowed the paramour to come to the home and left the children alone with him. The paramour confessed to kil ling the toddler and is awaiting trial for first degree murder. DCFS indicated the paramour for death by a buse and indicated the mother for death by neglect; DCFS also indicated the mother and the paramour for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. The toddler's half-sister came into care and was placed in a traditional foster home. Reason for Review: The toddler's mother came into DCFS care when she was 2 years old and was later adopted. At 16 years old, the mothe r returned to DCFS car e through a dependenc y petition after she repeatedly ran away from home and her adoptive parents reported she needed more services than they could provide. DCFS learned the mother was pregnant with the to ddler and she was placed in a residential maternity program. In December 2019, the toddler was born. In A pril 2020, DCFS was granted temporary custody of the then 4monthold to ddler, after the mother left the placement without permission and took the baby with her. Other concerns were also voiced about the mo ther's ability to care for the baby who was placed in a traditional foster home. The mother began parti cipating in services and making progress but in April 2021, DCFS opened an investigation after the mothe r took the toddler on an unauthorized visit. Following the incident, the mother's visits were decreas ed. In June 2021, DCFS indicated the investigation for substantial ri sk of physical injury/environme nt injurious to health and welfare by neglect. The mother had regular visits with the toddler and participated in services. In October 2021, the mother 73 disclosed she was pregnant with the toddler's halfsister. The mother reported she and the paramour planned to live separately. The mother was placed in a pregnant and parenting teen group home, attended prenatal appointments, had supervised visits with the toddler, and worked on obtaining housing, employment, and education. She w as inconsistent in attending a weekly substance treatment program and tested positive for THC. She later reported she stopped using m arijuana during her pregnancy. In December 2021, the mother was granted unsupervised visits becau se she was making progress in her service plan. In February 2022, the caseworker made multiple at tempts to engage the paramour in services. A background check revealed the paramour had a 2018 conviction for assault of a pregnant person. Case notes documented that he participated in a domestic violence as sessment but was determined not to need services, and he was referred for a mental health assessment. I n March 2022, the mother moved into her own apartment and the duration of her visits with the toddler i ncreased. That month, the mother gave birth to the toddler's halfsister and DCFS opened an investigation b ecause she had a child in care of DCFS. Her caseworker's supervisor reported the mother had successfull y completed services in the teen parent program and the only concern was the paramour, who had been add ed to the service plan but had not completed services. The mother de nied the paramour lived in the home. The State's Attorney reported no concerns about the safety of the halfsister in the mother's ho me and stated the mother had been informed the father could not have contact with the toddler. In April 20 22, while the investigation was pending, the mother asked the caseworker if the paramour could be present fo r unsupervised overnight visits. Five days later, a service provider reported they thought the paramour wa s staying at the home. At court the next day, the workers reported they wanted to staff the case before making a recommendation to grant overnight visits, but the judge ordered ove rnight visits. Before the todd ler's first overnight visit with the mother, the caseworker conducted an unannounced visit and noted the toddler had a cut on her head, which the mother stated was from her hair being braided too tightly. The worker advised the mother to make a doctor's appointment to ensure it was healing correctly. Two days later, DCFS unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to he alth and welfare by neglect. The next day, approximately one week before the toddler's death, the mother c ontacted her caseworker to ask for approval to allow the paramour t o be present for overnight visi ts. The worker informed the mother he could not be present because he had not completed services. Child No. 32 DOB: 09/2005 DOD: 05/2022 Homicide Age at death: 16 years Cause of death: Gunshot wound of the head Alleged perpetrator: Teen's boyfriend Reason for review: Child was a youth in care Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sixteenyearold, sustained gunshot wounds to the head and was transported to the hospital, where she remained on life support for four days befo re she was pronounced deceased. The shooting occurred at the home of the teen's 19yearold boyfrie nd, who lived with his mother. The boyfriend initially reported the teen shot herself. Police repo rted that the teen and the boyfriend had a history of domestic violence, and the boyfriend had a criminal history that included weapons violations. Police arrested and charged the boyfriend for destruction of ev idence. DCFS investigated the teen's death and indicated the boyfriend for death by abuse; DCFS unfounded the teen's foster parent for death by neglect and inadequate supervision. Reason for Review: The teen and her three siblings came into DCFS care in 2019 du ring an investigation in which her mother was indicated for cuts, bruis es, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse; and substantial risk of physical injury/environment inju rious to health and welfare by abuse and by neglect. In July 2021, the teen was placed in a relative foster home, and she remained in this placement until her death. In September 2021, the teen enrolled in high s chool and her foster parent reported she was attending school and appeared to be stable. The family's placem ent worker continued to monitor the 74 children and attempted to meet with the mother. Fifteen days be fore the teen's death, her foster parent gave the placement agency a 14day notice for the removal of th e teen from her home. She stated the teen and her 19yearold sister attacked their mother, the teen woul d not cooperate with services or anything that was asked of her, and she c ould no longer manage them in h er home. Child No. 33 DOB: 03/2014 DOD: 05/2022 Homicide Age at death: 8 years Cause of death: Multiple injuries due to assaul t Perpetrator: Child's mothe r Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation withi n one year of child's death Action taken: Included in syste mic issue report; report to Dire ctor June 30, 2022 See Death and Serious Injury Investigation 13 Narrative: Eightyearold was discovered deceased in bed, with her mother next to her. The child's mother admitted to suffocating her. The mother has been charged with first degree murder. The DCFS investigation into the child's death remains pending. Reason for Review: In March 2022, DCFS received a re port that the child's mother struck her father in the face numerous times while the child was present, the mot her was intoxicated during the altercation, and she had a history of using phencyclidine (PCP). Police resp onded and allowed the mother to leave with the child. The next day, the CPI made a good faith attempt to see the child and documented no further attempts for nearly two months. Six days before the child's dea th, the investigation was reassigned. The day before the child's death, the CPI met with the child and he r mother. The mother reported the child's father tried to kill her. She stated the day of the incident, h e attempted to push her out of his car while he was driving, she hit him to get him to stop, and police were ca lled and instructed them to separate, and no arrests were made. The mother denied using PCP and agreed to co mplete a toxicology screening. The child reported she was in the car with her parents, who were hi tting and screaming at each other, and when her father parked the car, her mother told her to get out of th e car and run, but she was afraid, so she did not. The child reported she felt safe with her mother and was o bserved to be clean and free of visible marks or bruises. She was assessed as safe in her mother's home. The investigation remained pending when the child was found deceased. DCFS later indicated the mother for s ubstantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to h ealth and welfare by neglect. Child No. 34 DOB: 09/2006 DOD: 06/2022 Homicide Age at death: 15 years Cause of death: Gunshot wound of the head Alleged perpetrator: Unknown Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fifteenyearold was found in an alley with a gunshot wound to the head around 6:00am. Emergency services pronounced the teenager decease d at the scen e. Police reported no known motive for the shooting at the time of the teen's death. DCFS did not inve stigate the teen's death for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: In December 2021, DCFS received a report that the teen had bee n detained for trespass of a vehicle and the fam ily would not retrieve the tee n from the police station. The teen stated he had been kicked out of his father's home in July 2021 and he re fused to go to a shelter. The teen fled after he was transported to his father's home. The father reported ha ving trouble with the teen's behavior and stated he was the teen's only s upport since the teen's mother d ied several years earlier. He denied locking the teen out and stated the teen chose to leave because he did not want to follow rules. Law enforcement confirmed the family filed a missing person report in July 2021 . The teen's 13yearold brother reported the teen caused trouble. In January 2022, the teen was arrested for weapons possession. In February 2022, 75 the father stated concerns about the teen's gang affiliation, a nd the teen stealing a gun. A collateral contact reported no concerns about the teen 's father or stepmother and stated they repeatedly tried to help the teen. DCFS unfounded the investigation for inadequate supervision and lockout. Child No. 25 DOB: 08/2017 DOD: 06/2022 Homicide Age at death: 4 years Cause of death: Multiple injuries due to child abuse Alleged perpetrator: Paramour of child's mothe r Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death Action taken: Full investigation pending Narrative: Fouryearold was transported by ambulance to the hospital, wh ere she was pronounced deceased. The child had been in the care of the mother's paramo ur while the mother was at work. The paramour stated the child fell out of bed and was breathing hea vily. Emergency responders reported the child had foam around her nose, lacked a pulse, and was not bre athing. At the hospital, the child was observed to have bruising to her arms, legs, and temple; an abr asion on her nostril; and a burn mark on the top of her foot. DCFS investigated the child's death and indica ted the paramour for death by abuse and indicated the mother for death by neglect. Reason for Review: Twelve days before the child's death, DCFS received a report t h e c h i l d h a d presented at the hospital with unu sual pattern burns to her han ds, feet, and both elbows; the mother told hospital staff the child sustained the burns four or five days earlier during a bath, because the child turned on the hot water when the mother left the bathroom for a few mi nutes. The mother said she attempted to treat the burns at home but brought the child to the hospital b ecause her foot was not healing. The reporter noted there were no burns on the child's back, buttocks, or leg s . T he C P I m e t w i t h t he f a m i l y a t t he hospital. The mother stated she was bathing the child while coo king and left the bathroom to check on the food. She returned to the bathroom when she heard a scream and saw the child had turned on the hot water. She stated she did not see any skin coming off, and she looked up how to treat the burn at home. She brought the child to the hospital because the burn had not impr oved. The CPI attempted to interview the child, who stated the burn did not hurt, but otherwise did not understand her questions. The mother identified her paramour as her only source of support; she told the CPI the paramour was a friend. The child was discharged to the mother's paramour under an outofh ome safety plan. The child's treating physician reported concern about the mother's delay in seeking treatment given the severity of the burn but stated she could not state the delay on its own was abuse o r neglect. The physician stated the child's injuries did not align with the mother's account of the inciden t. Two days before the child's death, DCFS terminated the safety plan, and the child was returned to her m other's care. At the time of the child's death, the investigation remained pending. DCFS later indicated the mo ther and her paramour f or burns by abuse. Child No. 36 DOB: 12/2021 DOD: 06/2022 Homicide Age at death: 5 months Cause of death: Gunshot wound of head Alleged perpetrator: Unknown Reason for review: Open intact family services case at time of child's death; indicated child protection investigation within one yea rof child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fivemonthold was shot and killed while riding in a car with her mother, father, and a sibling. The parents began driving erratically because they bel ieved they were being followed. Multiple gunshots hit the car and the infant was hit in the forehead. Th e infant was taken to the hospital, where she was pronounced deceased. DCFS did not investigate the infant's death. 76 Reason for Review: In September 2021, DCFS received a report that the infant's mo ther and father had been fighting. DCFS took the report as a child welfare serv ices referral but were unsuccessful in contacting the mother. In April 2022, DCFS received a report th at the infant's parents were engaged in frequent domestic violence in the presence of the children, and the infant's mother had an order of protection against the father but allowed him in the home. The mother denied any recent domestic violence and stated the infant's father did not live in the home. The mo ther reported she had a restraining order against the father and called law enforcement to remove the fat her from the home in the previous month. The mother stated the incidents with the father were verbal onl y and the children were never injured during the arguments. The CPI interviewed the siblings. The 9yearold maternal halfsister reported the infant's father lived in the home and she had witnessed him punching, ch oking, and throwing her mother; he had almost hit her once when she told him not to hit her mother; an d he had once hit her brother. The brother reported the father lived in the home, punched his mother in th e head, and beat him up when he did something bad. During a home visit, an unidentified man was pre sent, and the mother refused to provide information on him. The CPI determined the man was the infant's father, who had an extensive criminal record, including 13 charges and one conviction for assault. Th e CPI implemented a safety plan for the children to stay with mother's cousin. The mother agreed to int act family services. In May 2022, the CPI informed the mother the order of protection was no longer valid because of her missed court date and referred her to a victim services and therapy program. The chil dren reported they felt safe and were free of any signs of abuse. In June 2022, the CPI interviewed the fa ther, who reported he was coparenting but not in a current relationship with the mother. He admitted to a nger issues and past domestic violence incidents but stated no one was injured. DCFS indicated both pa rents for substantial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Three w eeks before the infant's death the intact family case opened. The mother ag reed to engage in recommended services, including domestic violence and parenting services. The father refused services. The intact worker made additional attempts to see the family before the infant's death but was only able to speak wit h them by video conference. Two days before the infant's death, the intact worker shared concerns wi th her supervisor, and made an unsuccessful unannounced visit to the home the next day. 77 SUICIDE Child No. 37 DOB: 08/2005 DOD: 12/2021 Suicide Age at death: 16 years Cause of death: Asphyxia due to hanging Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death; unfounded child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Child No. 38 DOB: 01/2004 DOD: 12/2021 Suicide Age at death: 17 years Cause of death: Contact gunshot wound of head, significant cont ributing condition of history of substance abuse Reason for review: Three unfounded child protection investigati ons within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Child No. 39 DOB: 11/2006 DOD: 12/2021 Suicide Age at death: 15 years Cause of death: Selfinflicted gunshot wound to the head Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Child No. 40 DOB: 02/2003 DOD: 01/2022 Suicide Age at death: 18 of death: Toxicity of fent anyl and methamphetamine due to fentanyl and methamphetamine abuse Reason for review: Deceased was a youth in care Action Taken: Investigatory review of records Child No. 41 DOB: 01/2010 DOD: 04/2022 Suicide Age at death: 12 years Cause of death: Asphyxia due to hanging Reason for review: Closed intact family services case and two i ndicated child protection investigations within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Child No. 42 DOB: 07/2010 DOD: 06/2022 Suicide Age at death: 11 years Cause of death: Hanging Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records 78 UNDETERMINED Child No. 43 DOB: 04/2017 DOD: 08/2021 Undetermined Age at death: 4 years Cause of death: Gunshot wound of ches t Reason for review: Indicated child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fouryearold was shot in the chest when her 8yearold brothe r pulled an unsecured firearm from the grasp of her 6 yearold sibling to return it t o the bag the 6yearold took the firearm from. The child was transported to the hospital by ambulance, where s he was pronounced deceased. At the time of her death, she and three of her siblings were in the care of their uncle while their mother, her paramour, and their infant brother were at the hospital with their 2year old brother. The mother knew the uncle owned a handgun. The uncle stated he normally kept the gun in t he trunk of his car but that day, he accidentally brought the bag that contained the gun into the re sidence and placed it on the couch with a pillow over it. He stated he then walked to the back of the apa rtment to lock the door when he heard one gunshot. Police arrested the uncle for child endangerment. DCFS investigated the child's death and indicated the uncle for death by neglect. Reason for Review: In August 2020, DCFS received a report that the mother's param our, father of the deceased child's youngest sibling, threatened the father of the deceased child and the child's older siblings with a firearm after the older children's father confronted the paramour about spanking the children. The reporter further expressed concern for the then 1yearold brot her, who has asthma, because the week prior, the mother did not immediately seek care when he had a f ever. When the mother did bring him to the emergency room he was diagnosed with pneumonia and admitted to the hospital. The reporter also shared concerns about the mother's mental health. The mother de nied the allegations a nd told the CPI that the father of the older children was abusive, angry that she le ft him, and she planned to get an order or protection. She stated the 1yearold was admitted to a childre n's hospital and the hospital continued to monitor the child as he was d iagnosed with a heart condition. T he children were assessed as safe, the home was observed to be appropriate a nd had appropriate sleeping arr angements. The mother obtained an order of protection against the father of the older children who she identified as the aggressor. The mother's paramour denied the allegations a nd stated the father of the ol der children confronted him. The CPI observed the children multiple times throughout the investigati on and observed no signs of abuse or neglect. DCFS indicated the mother's paramour for substantial r isk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by abuse due to evidence the in cident occurred and the paramour's criminal history. DCFS unfounded the mother for medical neglect. Child No. 44 DOB: 06/2021 DOD: 08/2021 Undetermined Age at death: 7 weeks Cause of death: Undetermined (in fant with pneumonia found unres ponsive in inappropriate sleeping environment) Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sevenweekold was found unresponsive while cosleeping with h is parents, who called 911. The infant was transported by ambulance to the hospital, t hen transferred to a children's hospital. He was pronounced deceased the next day, after he was removed from life support. DCFS investigated the infant's death and unfounded the parents for death by neglect b ut indicated the parents for substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. 79 Reason for Review: In February 2021, DCFS received a report that the 20yearold mother and her 14yearold sister, the infant's maternal aunt, were involved i n a physical fight during which the mother hit the aunt on the head with a phone. The CPI made good faith attempts to see the children at home and at the aunt's school, but the school reported the aunt was enro lled in remote learning and they had no specific concerns about the aunt's wellbeing. In March 2021, th e CPI met with the family at home. Family members reported the maternal grandmother was home during the i ncident, and the infant's mother was not in a caregiving role at that time. The maternal grandmother and the infant's 13yearold maternal aunt broke up the fight. The children all stated they felt safe at h ome and were observed to be free of visible marks or bruises. In April 2021, the family reported the mother moved out of the maternal grandmother's home. DCFS unfounded the investig ation for cuts, bruises, welts , abrasions, and oral i njuries by abuse to the 14yearold aunt by the infant's mother. Child No. 45 DOB: 06/2021 DOD: 08/2021 Undetermined Age at death: 2 months Cause of death: Undetermined Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death; unfounded child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Included in syste mic issue report; report to Dire ctor June 30, 2022 See Death and Serious Injury Investigation 13 Narrative: Twomonthold was found unresponsive and cold to the touch in an adult bed with her parents. The infant's mother called 911 and the infant was tran sported by ambulance to the hospital, where she was pronounced deceased upon arrival around 9:00am. The mot her reported she had fed the infant around 1:00am and laid her down to sleep. The mother admitted t o using marijuana but denied using the night prior to the infant's death. DCFS investigated the infant 's death and unfounded the investigation for death by neglect. Reason for Review: In January 2021, DCFS received a report that the home had dirt y diapers and old food throughout the home, dirty dishes in the sink, and squirre ls in the home. The reporter added that the mother continued to use marijuana and drink while pregnant with the infant. The CPI documented multiple attempts to contact the family. In April 2021, the CPI received a call from the reporter, who recanted the report and stated he called the Hotline to retaliate against th e mother. The next day, the CPI made inperson contact with the family, documente d the infant's then 9montho ld and 2yearold siblings were free of any marks or bruises, and did not observe any food left out in the home. The mother denied the allegations of squirrels coming into the hom e. The mother's landlord report ed the mother had been a good tenant and stated squirrels had been making a nest in the side of the home but denied problems inside the home. DCFS unfounded the investigation for environmental neglect. One week after the infant's birth, DCFS received a report that the home had garbage piled up, an insect infestation, spoiled food, and a bad odor. In addition, the father, a convicted felon, was verbally abusiv e to the 2yearold sibling, verbally and physically abused the mother in front of the children and left a gun within reach of the children. The CPI documented four good faith attemp ts to see the family before th e infant died and the investigation remained pending at the time of the child's death. The CPI later observe d the home to be in deplorable condition and indicated the investigation for environmental neglect and u nfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. 80 Child No. 46 DOB: 08/2021 DOD: 08/2021 Undetermined Age at death: 2 weeks Cause of death: Unexplained sudde n death (extrinsic factors ide ntified) Reason for review: Open intact family services case at time of child's death; unfounded child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Seventeendayold was found unresponsive around 5:00am, with b lood coming from his nose and mouth, after his father fell asleep while holding him. His mother attempted to wake him up and began CPR, and his father calle d 911. The newborn was transport ed to the hospital by ambulance, where he was pronounced deceased. The newborn's paternal grandmother had been watching the newborn the evening before, until his parents picked him up at 1:00am. DCFS investigated the infant's death and unfounded the newborn's parents for death by neglect. Reason for Review: In March 2021, DCFS received a report that the newborn's then 15yearold mother was residing with the infant's then 18yearold father, when the mother became pregnant by the father. The reporter stated the newborn's maternal grandmother changed the mother's address with her school and gave the newborn's pat ernal grandmother guardianship of the mother. The reporter also noted the paternal grandmother's home was the safest place for the mo ther to stay, because the maternal grandmother had been using drugs and planned to leave the state . The mother reporte d she had lived with the father for nine months, because she did not feel safe at ho me, and her school and the newborn's paternal grandmother were helping her with emancipation. The paternal gr andmother reported the mother and father began dating when the father was 17 years old, and she e xplained the consequences of their age difference when he turned 18, but the father ran away and refus ed to come home without the mother due to the mother's home situation. S he stated the mother's room wa s on a different floor than the father's room, and she did not know the mother had been going to the fat her's room until the mother became pregnant. The parents attended parenting classes and prenatal a ppointments. The parents agreed to intact services, which began in April 2 021. The State's Attorney decli ned to file charges because the father was 17 years old when he and the mother began their relationship. I n May 2021, DCFS unfounded the father and his parents for sexual pene tration. In June 2021, the fathe r graduated high school and the parents moved into a residence with the paternal uncle and uncle's para mour. The intact worker noted no concerns with the home. The mother recei ved a car seat and crib from her school. The intact worker provided baby clothes, information on legal assistance for the mother's emanc ipation, and confirmed the parents attended parenting classes. After the newborn's birth in August 2021, th e intact worker observed the newborn's nursery and crib, discussed safe sleeping practices with the pa rents, observed the infant to appear healthy, observed the mother to be doing well with the newborn, and disc ussed plans for the mother's return to high school. The intact case remained open at the time of the n ewborn's death. Child No. 47 DOB: 08/2021 DOD: 08/2021 Undetermined Age at death: 2 weeks Cause of death: Undetermined due t o no traumatic injury or natu ral disease found at autopsy; significant contributing condition of cosleeping with adult an d child Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twoweekold was found unresponsive by his mother, who had bee n cosleeping with him. The mother stated she nursed him around 4:00am then dozed off. The mother called 911 and paramedics transported the newborn to the hospital, where he wa s pronounced deceased. The newborn had been born with jaundice, but his levels were normal at his followup appointment, and his pediatrician said he was a healthy baby. DCFS unfounded its investigation of the newborn's death because the autopsy showed no evidence of abuse or neglect. 81 Reason for Review: In November 2020, DCFS received a report that the mother conta cted police because the father committed aggr avated battery against the new born's then 13yearold halfbrother earlier that month. The mother stated she did not call police i nstantly because the father threatened her. The mother stated she did not seek medical attention for the 13 yearold because she did not think his injuries were severe. When police responded they did not observ e any injuries. On the day of the DCFS report, the CPI observed the children in the home, saw no physi cal signs of abuse or neglect, and observed the home to be safe. The mother told the CPI that the father an d the 13yearold were play-fighting and she told them to stop. The mother told the CPI she made the rep ort after she ran into the father the night before and he cursed a t her. The 13yearo ld stated his fight w ith the newborn's father started as play but turned into an altercation which the mother broke up, and he ha d not seen the newborn's father since. He denied being afraid of anyone in the home. DCFS unfounded the i nvestigation for substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to health and welfare by abuse and neglec t. Child No. 48 DOB: 05/2021 DOD: 09/2021 Undetermined Age at death: 4 months Cause of death: Sudden unexpected i nfant death with cosleeping Reason for review: Open high -risk intact family services case a nd three pending child protection investigations at time of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fourmonthold was found unresponsive at home around 5:00am by h e r m o t h e r ' s paramour. The mother began CPR and the paramour called 911. The infant was transported to the hospital by ambulance. She had last been seen alive approximately two ho urs earlier when her mother gave her a bottle and fell asleep while feeding her. DCFS investigated the infant's death and indicated her mother for death by neglect and substantial risk of physical injury/enviro nment injurious to health and welfare by neglect to the infant's three siblings. Reason for Review: In May 2021, DCFS opened an investigation after receiving a r eport that the infant's mother tested positive for amphetamines when the infan t was born. DCFS initiated a safety plan in which the mother was not to have unsupervised contact with t he children. The mother stated she took the maternal grandmother's Addera ll by mistake, believing the b lue pills were Excedrin, and she did not know she took the wrong medication until several hours later. T he maternal grandmother stated she told the mother to look for headache medication in her pill bottle w hen the mother reported a headache but did not warn the mother that she had her prescription medication mi xed in with other pills. The infant's mother denied drug use and agreed to participate in intact family serv ices. She agreed to toxicology screenings and a mental health and substance use assessment prior to endin g the safety plan. DCFS terminated the safety plan one month after the investigation opened, after the mother met the requirements. The CPI documented speaking with the mother about safe sleeping practic es. The investigation remained pending at the time of the infant's death. The investigation was later indicated for substantial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. In Augu st 2021, DCFS opened another investigation after receiving a report that the family's apartm ent was in deplorable condition, including fecal matter on the floor and wa lls, vomit on mattresses, mold growing in the home, and trash throughout the home. The mother agreed to allow the maternal grandmother t o care for the children under a safety plan. The mother denied the allegations but would not allow the CPI to enter the home. The CPI though documented discussing safe sleep practices with the mother. Thr ee days later, the CPI returned to the home which had been cleaned. The CPI saw the children at their mater nal grandmother's home. The children's pediatrician did not have concer ns about the family. The mother completed a mental health assessment, and the provider made no recomme ndations. The investigation rem ained pending at the time of the infant's death and was later indicated for environmental neglect. In mid August 2021, the transitional visit for intact family services occurred. Three days later, DCFS opened another investigation after receiving a report that the infant's 2yearold, 3yearold, and 4yearold siblings were alone outside the home and all 82 three were dirty with wet diapers. The CPI documented a good fa ith attempt to see the family that day. Four days before the infant died, the CPI observed the family a t the maternal grandmother's home. The investigation remained pending at the time of the infant's deat h and was later indicated for inadequate supervision. The family's intact family worker identified neede d services including an additional mental health and substance use asses sment, random toxicology screenin gs, and parenting classes. Intact workers observed the children on multiple home visits, noting the child ren appeared safe, and documented safe sleeping arrangements for all children. Child No. 49 DOB: 12/2019 DOD: 09/2021 Undetermined Age at death: 21 months Cause of death: Drowning Reason for review: Open intact family services case at time of child's death; indicated child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twentyonemonthold was found face down in a bathtub by her m other, who called 911. The toddler was transported by ambulance to the hospital, where she was pronounced deceased. The mother reported she had bathed t wo of the toddler's older sibli ngs and left the bathtub unattended for approximately two to three minutes after taking them out of the bath to tend to another sibling. She returned to the bathroom and found the toddler face down and un responsive. The mother stated the toddler had started walking the week prior and had gotten into the bath tub by herself. Police officers who responded to the scene stated the home was very dirty and the f ather fled when they arrived because he had multiple arrest warrants. The mother stated the father was in the home but did not live there. DCFS investigated the toddler's death and indicated the mother for d eath by neglect, inadequate supervision, and environmental neglect. Reason for Review: In June 2021, DCFS received a re port that the children were fr equently unattended and running around naked outside. The next day, the CPI met with the family and documented the toddler and her five siblings, between the ages of 2 months and 8 years, were dirty and unbathed; the home was filled with garbage and there was old food on the floo r; and the mother was growing marijuana plants in the home. The toddler's then 2monthold sister was o bserved sleeping on a mattress with blankets and pillows, in a locke d room. DCFS took protective cu stody of the children, but the court returned the children to their mother's care under court superv ision and DCFS opened an intact family services case. DCFS indicated the mother for inadequate supervi sion and environmental neglect and indicated both parents for substantial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. The intact worker reported the parents were coopera tive with services. The intact worker recommended substance use assessment, parenting classes, and do mestic violence services. The mother reported she installed a new alarm system to prevent the childr en from opening the back door. The intact worker observed blankets in the 2monthold's crib and discusse d safe sleep with the mother multiple times throughout the case. The mot her reported the father did n ot live in the home, but he was often present when the intact worker visited. The mother was engaged in paren ting classes, the toddler was engaged in physical therapy, the toddler's oldest siblings began school, a nd the toddler's 4yearold brother was on the waitlist for daycare. The intact worker documented the home was sometimes appropriately clean and at other times, the home was in disarray. One day before the to ddler's death, the intact worker observed the home and did not document any safety concerns, and the youn ger children were observed asleep in appropriate sleeping arrangements. 83 Child No. 50 DOB: 06/2020 DOD: 11/2021 Undetermined Age at death: 17 months Cause of death: Cardiopulmonary arrest due to possible hypother mia Reason for review: Closed intact family services case within on e year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Seventeenmonthold was found in a retention pond in a neighbo ring state. The day before, DCFS received a report that the mother was found murder ed at home and the toddler was missing. Illinois State Police issued an endangered missing person advis ory. The mother's onandoff paramour was arrested and charged with the murder of the toddler's mothe r. There are no formal charges in the toddler's death. DCFS investigated the toddler's death and indi cated the paramour for death by abuse. Reason for Review: In November 2020, DCFS opened an intact family services case f or the toddler's mother after indicating the mother for medical neglect because the toddler was born with slow uterine growth disorder and had missed her followup appointment. The f amily's intact family services case included recommendations for individual therapy, parenting clas ses, and ensuring the mother followed up on the toddler's medical treatme nt. The mother was compliant wi th services, attended all medical appointments, and completed parenting classes. The intact worke r made regular announced and unannounced visits and assessed the home of the mother and the toddler's maternal grandparents, who often watched the toddler while the mother worked, as safe. In March 2021, DCFS successfully closed the intact family services case. Child No. 51 DOB: 06/2020 DOD: 11/2021 Undetermined Age at death: 16 months Cause of death: Undetermined Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Oneyearold was found unresponsiv e by the grandmother. Parame dics noted the toddler was cold to the touch, and had dried blood on his nose, mouth, and fingers, as well as scratch marks from his neck to his belly button. DCFS investigated the toddler's d eath and unfounded the investigation against the toddler's mother for death by abuse because la w enforcement found no evidence the toddler's parents contributed to his death. Reason for Review: In September 2021, DCFS receive d a report that the parents use d drugs in the presence of the toddler and engaged in domestic violence when u nder the influence. The reporter also alleged that the parents left th e toddler in the care of the pa ternal grandmother who also used drugs, and the home had animal feces. The CPI visited the family and noted the toddler appeared healthy, with no signs of abuse or neglect, and the home was free of any environ mental concerns. The toddler's mother denied anyone in the home used drugs, as did the toddler's 16y earold maternal uncle, who lived in the home. The investigation was pending at the time the toddler die d. The investigation was later unfounded against the toddler's mother and father for environmental negle ct, inadequate supervision, and substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and wel fare by neglect because the home appeared clean during an unannounced visit and the parents and uncle den ied anyone in the home had issues with substance misuse. 84 Child No. 52 DOB: 08/2008 DOD: 12/2021 Undetermined Age at death: 13 years Cause of death: Gunshot wound of head Reason for review: Child was a youth in care within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Thirteenyearold was brought to the emergency room with a gun shot wound of the head. He was pronounced deceased later that day. The teen had been li ving with his maternal great aunt. The teen's 11yearold brother reported their adult cousin, who als o lived in the home, accidentally shot the teen. An unlocked gun box and am munition were found in the cous in's room and the cousin was arrested. DCFS investigated his death and indicated his cousin for death by abuse and wounds by abuse; DCFS indicated his maternal great aunt for wounds by neglect and ina dequate supervision. Reason for Review: In 2016, DCFS took protective custody of the then 7yearold t een and his then 6yearold brother. They were placed with their great aunt and remained in her foster home throughout the case with a permanency goal of guardianship. The placement worker made regular monthly visits with the family. In March 2021, the maternal great aunt obtained sub sidized guardianship and DCFS closed the placement case. Child No. 53 DOB: 11/2021 DOD: 01/2022 Undetermined Age at death: 5 weeks Cause of death: Sudden unexplained infant death, significant co ntributing condition of unsafe sleep environment Reason for review: Three unfounded and one indicated child prot ection investigations within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fiveweekold was found unresponsive by his mother and materna l grandmother. The mother called 911 and the infant was transported by ambulance t o the hospital, where he was pronounced deceased. The grandmother had been watching the infant and his 2yearold maternal halfsister, while his mother was at a relative's home. When the mother returned, the grandmother placed the infant on a Boppy pillow on his mother's bed. The mother reported she fed and bur ped the infant, then placed him back on the Boppy pillow to sleep. DCFS investigated the infant's death and unfounded his mother for death by neglect. The rationale noted the Boppy pillow company had recen tly issued a recall due to eight reports of babies suffocating while using their product. Reason for Review: In December 2020, DCFS received a report of a domestic violenc e incident between the maternal grandmother and the grandmother's paramour while a then 1yearold sibling was present. Police arrested the paramour; they observed no marks o r injuries to the sibling or the grandmother. That day, the CPI met with the grandmother and sibling at the h ome. The grandmother reported she had been involved with the paramour for seven months and there had been no prior domestic violence incidents. The grandmother repor ted she ended the relationship. The CPI provided a pack-and-play because there were no safe sleeping arrangements in the home, a nd the grandmother stated she often cared for the sibling. In January 2021, DCFS indicated the paramour f or substantial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by abuse. DCFS unfo unded the maternal grandmother. In April 2021, DCFS received a repor t that the mother sent a text message saying she w as going to jump off a bridge with the infant's sibling. Emergency medical services assessed the mother and determined she was not suicidal. The CPI met with the family at the home, and the mother stated she sent the text message one year earlier because she was angry with the sibling's fathe r. She admitted to past mental health concerns but reported no recent issues. Multiple contacts confi rmed the mother's report that she had sent the text message one year earlie r, and they reported no concern s about her care for the sibling. In July 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. In August 2021, DCFS received a report that the mother was having a 85 mental health crisis. The reporter further expressed concern th at the mother had engaged in criminal activity, used drugs, and associat ed with dangerous men. The CP I met with the mother, who reported she was living with the maternal grandmother. The mother denied the allegations. She stated she was pregnant with the infant, and admitted to smoking marijuana due to nause a, but denied other drug use and completed toxicology screenings during her prenatal appointments. She sta ted the infant's deceased father had a child with another woman who had been threatening her. The CPI observ ed the sibling to have no signs of abuse or neglect and the home had safe sleeping arrangements. Collate ral contacts reported no concerns. In October 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by abuse and by neglect. Child No. 54 DOB: 01/2022 DOD: 01/2022 Undetermined Age at death: 11 days Cause of death: Undetermined Reason for review: Child was a youth in care; pending child pro tection investigation at time of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Elevendayold died at the hosp ital after being removed from a ventilator. On the day of his birth, his mother nursed him, and hospital staff found he h ad stopped breathing. He was transferred to the NICU and placed on a ventilator. He died after the mother s igned a DNR (do not resuscitate) order and he was removed from the ventilator. Upon the newborn's deat h, DCFS added an allegation of death by neglect to the investigation that was pending at the time of the newborn's birth. The autopsy report noted suffocation could neither be confirmed nor ruled out. DCF S unfounded the investigation for death by neglect and substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Reason for Review: In 2019, DCFS took protective custody of the newborn's then 1 yearold, 4yearold, and 6yearold siblings. In 2020, the mother gave b irth to a fourth sibling, and DCFS took protective custody of the sibli ng. The children were placed wit h their maternal uncle. In 2020, the mother signed consents to allow the three older children to be adopted . The placement worker advised the mother to reengage in services if she wished to have the youngest sib ling returned home. The mother made sporadic visits with the youngest sibling. In August 2021, the mother reported she was pregnant with the newborn but would not provide the father's name. In September 2 021, the mother surrende red her parental rights to the newborn's then 16monthold sibling. The family's placement worker continued to make regular contact with the children in the home of their maternal uncle, and noted the children consistently appeared happy. The maternal uncle hired an adoption attorney a nd obtained an order of protection against the mother. In January 2022, the day after the newborn's birth, DCFS received a report that the mother gave birth, had other children in DCFS care, and the newborn ha d become unresponsive after nursing. The newborn was taken to the NICU and placed on a ventilator. DCFS took protective custody of the newborn. The investigation was later unfounded for death by neglect and substantial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Child No. 55 DOB: 07/2021 DOD: unknown Undetermined Age at death: About 6 months Cause of death: Undetermined Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death; unfounded child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Full investigation pending Narrative: Infant was reported missing in February 2022. The infant's mot her had been arrested for shoplifting, refused to inform police where she lived, and did not inform police her children were home alone. Three days later, the infant's 5yearold and 7yearold siblings were found home alone after the 86 7yearold called a relative to report they were cold and hungr y. The relative went to the home to get the children but could not find the infant. The mother initially to ld police the infant had never existed, but police found baby items in the ho me and received information th e mother had placed a crib and other items in a dumpster approximately 10 days earlier. The mother l ater made statements that the infant had died. The infant's body has not been located. The mother was ch arged with concealing a death and endangering the life of a child. DCFS investigated and indicate d the mother for inadequate supervision and substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Reason for Review: In May 2021, a relative reported that police ha d responded to a motel to conduct a wellbeing check on the infant's then 10yearold sister. The reporter stated the 10yearold sister said the mother, who was seven months pregnant, hit her, but she had no visible injuries, and the reporter left the motel after tensions had calmed. The reporter returned to t he motel following a second 911 call. The 10yearold sister was crying; had scratches on her nose, cheek , arms, and hands; and stated her mother hit her and she did not want to be left alone with her mother. The reporter observed a scratch on the mother's lip, and the mother sta ted they had argued and wrestle d. The reporter added concerns about mother's mental health. The CP I responded to the scene and met with a police officer who relayed concerns about the mother's mental state, because the mother ap peared confused, suspicious, and uncooperative. The mother stated the 10yearold did not want t o go to the store with the mother and younger siblings so she allowed the 10yearold to stay at the motel but instructed her to clean while they were gone. Upon returning the mother stated she verbally reprim anded the 10yearold for not cleaning, and the 10yearold physically a ttacked her, so she pushed and restrained the 10yearold in selfdefense. The 10yearold stated her mother began hitting her when she re fused to go to the store, and she hit her mother back, then she called her aunt after the family left for the store. The siblings r eported they did not witness their mother hit the olde r sister and felt safe with th eir mother. The mother declined intact family services but agreed the 10yearold should stay with her father , who traveled to the motel to pick her up. The younger sisters remained with the mother. In July 2021, whi le the previous investigation remained pending, DCFS received a report that the mother gave birth to t he infant, and hospital staff were concerned that the mother was exhibiting odd behavior, appeared hostile a nd paranoid. Hospital staff told the CPI the mother had been appropriate with the infant, and they had n o concerns about abuse or neglect. The mother stated she did not like how hospital staff had cared for the infant, so she got irritated and used unkind words. The CPI observed that the mother had a car seat a nd supplies for the infant. The CPI was subsequently unable to locate the mother. In October 2021, DCFS unfounded the July 2021 investigation for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious t o health and welfare by neglect. The previous investigation remained pending in February 2022 at the time the infant was reported missing. DCFS later indicated the mother for cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and o ral injuries by abuse; and substantial risk of physical inju ry/environment injurious to health and welfare by abuse. Child No. 56 DOB: 02/2003 DOD: 03/2022 Undetermined Age at death: 19 years Cause of death: Undetermined Reason for review: Deceased was a youth in care Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Nineteenyearold medically c omplex teen was found unresponsiv e in her room at the assisted living facility where she resided. An ambulance transp orted the teen to the hospital, where she was pronounced deceased. The previous day, she was taken to the emergency room because the facility nurse was unable to remove and change her catheter. The emergen cy room physician was also unable to change her catheter, provided a catheter bag for her, and disch arged her with instructions to follow up with her primary care physician. The m orning of her death, she was a wake, alert, and had eaten breakfast. The teen was medically complex and required the use of a wheelchair and catheter. She had been diagnosed with paralysis on one side; high blood pressure; neurogenic bow el; obstructive sleep apnea; and 87 neuromyelitis optica, a central nervous system disease that aff ects the optic nerves and spinal cord. The coroner documented she had a recent urinary tract infection, re cent treatment for streptococcal upper respiratory tract infection, pul monary edema, sinusoidal conges tion of the liver, and obesity. Her toxicology report came back negative for common substances of a buse and showed normal electrolyte levels. DCFS did not investigate the teen's death. Reason for Review: The teen came into DCFS care in 2019 following an investigatio n in which her mother was indicated for medical neglect. DCFS initially opened an intact family services case following the investigation, but the mother asked DCFS to take her childr en less than a month later. The teen spent substantial time in the hospital. In November 2020, the teen wa s placed at the facility she resided in when she died. The teen's sisters, ag es 12 and 14 remained in foster homes at the time of the teen's death. Child No. 57 DOB: 03/2019 DOD: 03/2022 Undetermined Age at death: 3 of death: Cerebral and cerebellar infarcts from dural sin us thrombosis due to dehydration and malnutrition due to an obstructive trichobezoar of the stom ach Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death; three unfounded child protection investigations within one year of child's deat h Action taken: Full investigation pending Narrative: Threeyearold was found unresponsive by her mother, who calle d 911. Paramedics performed CPR, administered Narcan because of concerns of drug use in the home, and transported the toddler to the hospital, where she was pronounced deceased. Fir st responders reported the toddler had a bump on her head and appeared severely malnourished. Law enforc ement detained three adults in the home. The mother reported the toddler was sick and vomiting in the days prior to her death, but they did not seek medical care. She added the toddler ate her own hair, but they took her for medical care a few months earlier and the doctor did not have concerns about the b ehavior. Upon autopsy the child was found to have a trichobezoar (concentr ated ball of hair) in her stoma ch that weighed 280 grams. DCFS investigated the toddler's death and indicated her parents for death by neglect. Reason for Review: The toddler's parents had seven children together, and each ha d two children from past relationships; the mother maintained primary custody of th e maternal halfsiblings and the paternal halfsiblings lived with the family periodically. The children ranged in age from 5 months to 24 years at the time of the toddler's death. The parents had a history with DCFS between 2009 and 2020, including five indicated investigations, and four prior intact family cas es. In midOctober 2021, DCFS received a report that the toddler's then 7yearold sister was locked out of the home for long periods of time without food or water, the children were often seen outside unattended, and 10 people lived in the onebedroom home. The reporter also shared the 12yearold was seen draggin g younger siblings by the hair down the street. Police reported they observed the 5yearold with a scr ape on her jawline and marks on her neck. The next day, the CPI went to the home with the assistance of l aw enforcement. The m other reported she was pregnant, due that month, and had not received any prenatal care. She stated the children did not have a primary care provide r, but she had taken them to the county h ealth department within the last year. She denied dragging the children by the hair and denied any of the older children did that to the younger children. The mother denied corporal punishment. The mother rep orted the home had three bedrooms; one bedroom belonged to the homeowner, one the parents shared with the toddler, and the remaining children slept in the third bedroom. The parents reported they went groc ery shopping regularly. The father would not allow the CPI to enter the home but allowed the police offi cer entry. The police officer reported no environmental concerns. The parents refused to allow the CPI to take photos, but the then 2yearold toddler, her 5yearold sister, and 6yearold sister were note d to be free of observa ble injuries. Two days later, DCFS received a report that the 8yearold sister had be en taking food from other students and she and the 7yearold sister requ ested breakfast because they had not eaten the night before. The report was taken for additional information and the CPI returned to the ho me. The mother reported she spent the 88 previous day at the hospital, and the children stayed home from school, but there was plenty of food in the home and the homeowner bought pizza for the children. She repor ted the children received lunch at school, but not breakfast. The father sta ted he would ensu re the childr en ate breakfast befor e school. The parents did not allow the CPI to interview the children separate from t he parents but again noted the children appeared free of visible injuri es. The verbal children reported having enough to eat and the 12yearold sister admitted to pulling the other children by the hair. Thre e days later, the mother gave birth. In midNovember 2021, while the investigation was pending, DCFS re ceived a report that the mother grabbed the 7yearold by the hair and the father used crack co caine. The parents again denied the CPI entry and the mother denied the allegations. At the end of Nove mber 2021, DCFS received a report that the home had a mouse infestation and left preteen siblings in c harge of the younger siblings overnight. The CPI was again denied entry t o the home and the mother again denied allegations. In December 2021, DCFS received a report that the parents refused a psychiatric e valuation for a teen sibling. The father again denied the CPI access to the home and the teen denied any psych iatric issues. The father withdrew the children from school and continued refusing to cooperate with D C F S . T h e C P I c o n t a c t e d t h e S t a t e ' s Attorney to request a court order for services. The request was pending at the time of the toddler's death. Child No. 58 DOB: 11/2021 DOD: 04/2022 Undetermined Age at death: 5 months Cause of death: Sudden unexplained infant death; significant fa ctors of unsafe sleep environment with bedsharing, acute viral b ronchiolitis, and laryngomalacia Reason for review: Pending child welfare services referral at t ime of child's death; unfounded child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: found unres ponsive, by his paternal grandmo ther who entered the room to give him medication. He had been sleeping on his back, on a single mattress with his father. The grandmother began CPR and ca lled 911. The infant was pronounced deceased by paramedics who responded to the home. The fathe r reported he cared for the inf ant full time since February 2022. He stated approximately two weeks before the infant's death, the mother c ared for the infant for a few days, and the infant was sick when he was returned to his father's care. Thre e days later, the father called paramedics because the infant's condition had not improved, and the infant was diagnosed with acute viral bronchiolitis and infantile eczema. He was prescribed a nebuliz e r , b u t t h e f a m i l y h a d n o t b e g u n t h e treatment because the pharmacy was out of stock. DCFS investiga ted the infant's death and unfounded his father for death by neglect. Reason for Review: In November 2021, DCFS received a report with concerns regardi ng the 18yearold mother's interaction with her newborn. The infant, who was born prematurely at 34 weeks gestation, was receiving treatment in the NICU, and progressing toward discharge, but the infant's mother refused to change his diaper or provide any care other than fee ding him. The reporter stated the mother also had an older child who was in the maternal grandmother's c are. The CPI saw the infant and the mother at the hospital that day and impl emented a safety plan that the maternal grandmother had to supervise the mother's visits with the infant. The CPI subsequently completed a home safety checklist at the maternal grandmother's home and assessed the home as safe. The next day, the infant was discharged to his maternal grandmother, with the safety plan still in place. The CPI regularly monitored the safety plan. The mother declined to sign temporar y guardianship paperwork but ag reed to intact family services. It was later determined that the singl e parent support program and com munitybased services would be more appropriate for the mother than intact family services. During the investigation, the infant's paternal grandmother contacted the assigne d CPI and reported she had bee n caring for the infant once a week since November 2021, and the infant's father wished to sign voluntary acknowledgement of paternity paperwork. In February 2022, the m aternal grandmother was movin g out of state, but the mother and children would stay in state with the infant's maternal grandfa ther. In March 2022, t he CPI contacted the 89 maternal grandmother after attempts to contact the mother were unsuccessful. The maternal grandmother reported the mother and children were doing well and continued to live with the maternal grandfather. DCFS unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physic al injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Eight days before the infant's death, D CFS received a report that the mother left the infant with his father several days earlier, and the father called paramedics because the infant was in respiratory distress, and the hospital was treating the infant but needed permission from his mother, who was his legal guardian. DCFS took the call as a child welfare s ervices referral, and the caseworker attempted to contact the family. The refer ral remained open when the infant died. Child No. 59 DOB: 01/2022 DOD: 04/2022 Undetermined Age at death: 2 months Cause of death: Undetermined Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death Action taken: Full investigation pending Narrative: Twomonthold was found unresponsive after cosleeping with a maternal aunt and twin sister. The aunt called 911 and began CPR. The infant was trans ported by ambulance to the hospital, where he was pronounced deceased. DCFS investigated the infant's deat h and indicated the maternal aunt for death by neglect and substantial risk of physical injury/enviro nment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Reason for Review: In January 2022, upon the birth of the infant and his twin sis ter, DCFS received three reports on three subsequent days. The reports alleged the mother used cocaine and marijuana during her pregnancy, had been staying in homeless shelters and was in an abusive relationship. The mother reportedly had a mental health diagnosis, and she had a young d aughter who lived out of state. The mother and twins tested negative for s ubstances at the time of deliver y. The day of the first report, the CPI met with the mother at the hospital, who denied using any drugs dur ing her pregnancy and stated she could stay with the infant's maternal aunt following her release from the hospital. The twins were observed to be healthy, awake, and safe with t he mother at the hospital. Th e family member confirmed the mother could stay with her until she found her own home, and denied th e mother used drugs during the pregnancy. In February 2022, DCFS received a report that the mother and tw ins lacked stable housing and the mother was a sex worker. The CPI spoke with a second maternal aunt, wh o stated she had taken the mother to a substance use treatment center in November 2021, but the mother left the facility after three days. The CPI made inperson contact with the mother and twins, and noted the twins appeared clean and lacked visible signs of maltreatment but were sleeping in a car seat and did n ot have cribs. The mother agreed to a safety plan with a third maternal aunt. The maternal aunt reported she had one crib in her home. The CPI provided a portable crib, discussed safe sleep with the aunt, and monito red the safety plan regularly. At the time of the infant's death, the intact family services case had not yet opened, the child protection investigation remained pending, and the infant and his twin remained in the c are of the third maternal aunt. DCFS later indicated the mother for substance misuse by neglect, inadequat e shelter, and substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to h ealth and welfare by neglect. Child No. 60 DOB: 11/2021 DOD: 05/2022 Undetermined Age at death: 5 months Cause of death: Undetermined Reason for review: Child was a youth in care; indicated child p rotection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fivemonthold was found unresponsive by his foster father. Th e infant was transported by ambulance to the hospital, whe re he was pronounced deceased. He had been born premature, at 33 90 weeks gestation, was substance exposed at birth, and his primar y care physician reported he had gastroesophageal reflux disease. The foster father reported the pediatrician advised him to place the twins in a reclined position, with their heads up and supported by a pillow due to their acid reflux. He stated he placed the infant, who was still sleeping, in a reclined positi on on a kingsized pillow on his bed while he fed and changed the twin in an a djacent room. He stated he retu rned 15 to 30 minutes later and saw the infant had rolled over and was bl ue. The foster father reported he started CPR, and color seemed to come back to the infant's face, so he attempted to ca ll a friend who was a nurse practitioner. He then called 911 and continued to perform CPR un til paramedics arrived. The infa nt's autopsy noted no evidence of injury or trauma, and the infant was negative for all tested substance s and all tested respiratory pathogens. DCFS investigated the infant's death and unfounded his foster father for death by neglect and substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Reason for Review: In November 2021, DCFS received a report that the mother gave birth to twins prematurely and the mother had five older children in DCFS care . Both the mother and the twins tested positive for cocaine and oxycodone; the mother admitted to usin g drugs. However, the twins were stable and showed no signs of withdrawal. In December 2021, the twins were discharged from the hospital, taken into protective custody, and pl aced in a licensed foster home. The foster father attended a training at the hospital before they came into h is care. The CPI observed safe sleeping arrangements in the foster home. DCFS indicated the mother for substance misuse by neglect and s ubstantial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. The pla cement worker conducted regular home visits throughout the case. The twins had gained weight at thei r onemonth wellness check. The twins also saw a kidney specialist and began weekly physical therapy follo wing an early intervention evaluation. In January 2022, DCFS received a re port that the foster father was carrying both infants in one child carrier. The report was taken as a licensing referral. The placement wor ker discussed the allegation with the foster father on two occasions and observed two car seats during the c onversations. In May 2022, the foster father informed the twins' doctor that they continued spitting up, and the doctor informed him to continue monitoring the behavior, and noted the twins continued to gain weight. Child No. 61 DOB: 02/2022 DOD: 06/2022 Undetermined Age at death: 4 months Cause of death: Undetermined Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Included in syste mic issue report; report to Dire ctor June 30, 2022 See Death and Serious Injury Investigation 13 Narrative: Fourmonthold was found unrespons ive. Her father reported he had fallen asleep with the infant in a fullsized bed for approximately 15 minutes. Th e infant's maternal grandfather took the infant to a nearby fire station where they unsuccessfully attem pted to revive her. She was transported to the hospital, where she was pr onounced deceased. The father did not live in the home but helped with the infant. The mother was at work at the time of the incident and the infant's siblings were upstairs. DCFS investigated the infant's death and unfounded the father for de ath by neglect. Reason for Review: In midFebruary 2022, DCFS recei ved a report that the infant's 10yearold brother had not been to school since January 2022 because the m other was afraid of COVID. The reporter also stated that when he did come to school he was very behind and wore the same clothes to school every day. In March 2022, the CPI first contacted the family at home. The brother showed off a closet full of clothes and stated he just liked to wear his favorite outfits. The brother reported he bathed every night. The brother and the 5yearold and 12yearold siblings reporte d they felt safe, and the infant was observed to be free of concerns. That mont h, DCFS unfounded the investig ation for inadequate clothing. 91 PENDING Autopsies for the following child de aths have not yet been released. Child No. 62 DOB: 05/2021 DOD: 07/2021 Pending Age at death: 2 months Cause of death: Autopsy pending Reason for review: Closed intact family services case and unfou nded child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twomonthold was found unresponsive in bed with her mother. T he grandfather called 911. First responders noted the infant was pale, cold to the to uch, and rigor mortis had begun to set in. The mother had a toddler bed and a packandplay in her room, but s tated the infant was fussy, so she brought the baby into bed with her. The mother admitted to leaving the infant and her 2yearold halfbrother with the maternal grandmother to use methamphetamine several days pr ior to the infant's death, but stated it was her first use in over a year. The infant's pediatrician rep orted the mother had a significant history of missing appointments for the infant and her 2yearold halfbro ther. Law enforcement noted they found drug paraphernalia in the mothe r's room. A DCFS investigation o f the infant's death remains pending. Reason for Review: In July 2020, DCFS opened an intact family services case durin g a pending investigation for reports that th e 19yearold mother was leavi ng her 1yearold with the maternal grandparents for days to use dr ugs with the father who was abus ive. Recommended services included substance use treatment, counse ling, domestic violence, and par enting education. The mother denied a need for domestic violence services reporting no recent contact with the 1yearold's father, who was a putative father of the infant, and that she had an order of pro tection against him. She admitted to using marijuana but denied using methamphetamine. The investigation w as unfounded for inadequate supervision and substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. In September 2020, DCFS received a report that the mother left home to use drugs without making a care plan for the then 2yearold brother; had left drug paraphernal ia within reach of the child and had reunited with the father. Law enforcement and the CPI responded to the h ome. Family members reported the grandmother became angry when the mother wanted to leave with t he child; the grandmother then assaulted the mother and police arr ested her. The mother, the m aternal grandfather, and the maternal aunt stated the mother informed the aunt she was leaving. The CPI no ted the mother did not appear to be intoxicated and the child appeared healthy. The mother agreed t o a toxicology screeni ng the next day but did not attend the appointment. She completed a screening 10 da ys later that was positive for marijuana. The intact worker stated the mot her smoked marijuana, but they had never seen drug pa raphernalia in the home, and there was no evidence the mother or the brother had b een around the father . DCFS unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physical injury/envir onment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. The mother continued to cooperate with intact family s ervices, including therapy for the mother and early intervention services for the brother, and the mother attended prenatal appointments. The mother also completed parenting classes. The mother had a crib for the infant, and the CPI discussed safe sleep with the mother. In March 2021, DCFS closed the intact case bec ause the mother had completed services. 92 Child No. 63 DOB: 01/2021 DOD: 10/2021 Pending Age at death: 9 months Cause of death: Autopsy pending Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death; unfounded child protection investigation within one yea rof child's death Action taken: Included in syste mic issue report; report to Dire ctor June 30, 2022 See Death and Serious Injury Investigation 13 Narrative: Ninemonthold was pronounced deceased at the hospital. The in fant's mother reported that a few hours before his death, the infant was drowsy and co ngested, so she suctioned him to relieve the congestion and placed him dow n for a nap. Approximately one hour later, she and the infant left to pick up the infant's 8yearold brother from school. While ridi ng public transportati on, the infant became unresponsive, and a transit secur ity guard called 911. The infa nt was transported to the hospital, where he was pronounced deceased. A DCFS investigation of the infant's d eath remains pending. Reason for Review: In October 2020, DCFS received a report that the infant's then 7yearold brother was often tardy and absent from school, the mother was using dr ugs, and the family was living in an abandoned building. The CPI made two attempts to visit the fami ly but did not see them until December 2020. The mother denied the allegations and stated she was kick ed out of her mother's home after an altercation and went to live with her paramour, but her childre n were allowed to stay with the grandmother. She disclosed she was pregnant with the infant. The mother's 7 yearold and 13yearold sons were interviewed at their maternal gr andmother's home. They reported they had lived there for about a year and reported the 7yearold had a school computer but had trouble l ogging in for remote learning. Both denied witnessing their mother using drugs or alcohol in the home. The 7yearold's teacher reported the mother had reached out to the school regarding issues logging in for r emote schooling, and he had been logging in on time and was visible on camera for the previous few weeks . DCFS unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to he alth and welfare by neglect. In August 2021, DCFS received a report that the mother was enrolled in a methad one treatment program but was also believed to be taking illicit substances and breastfeeding the infant; and the mother often had the infant's 8yearold sibling take care of t he infant. The mother was livi ng in a shelter at the time of the report. The CPI communicated with shelter sta ff two weeks later, but shelte r staff reported that the family moved out and they did not know where the f amily was. The investigation r emained pending at the time the child died because the CPI had not located the family. DCFS later ind icated the investigation for substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Child No. 64 DOB: 07/2006 DOD: 11/2021 Pending Age at death: 15 years Cause of death: Autopsy pending Reason for review: Child was a youth in care; indicated child p rotection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fifteenyearold's burned body was found in an alley. The teen had been missing from her placement for two days when the aunt reported the teen left to visit a friend's home and agreed to a curfew, but the teen did not return. That evening, the aunt not iced the teen had left her cellphone behind, which she stated was unusual, and the aunt reported the teen's absence to her placeme nt worker. A police report was filed. The aunt, the placement worker, and the teen' s school attempted to locate the teen until DCFS learned of her death. DCFS di d not investigate the teen's death for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: In September 2021, DCFS opened two investigations following re ports that the teen disclosed a physical alterca tion with her mother and the m other had locked the teen out of the home. School staff stated the teen had reported her mother was physic ally and verbally abusive. The CPI interviewed the teen's 5yearo ld and 9yearold sisters at sch ool, and both denied witnessing the incident, 93 and denied any harm or injuries. Five days later, DCFS took pro tective custody of the teen, though the siblings remained home. No relatives were willing to care for t he teen, and she was placed in a shelter. One week later, the teen's pl acement worker received a report t hat police were investigating a sexual assault and wanted to sch edule a victim sens itive interview wit h the teen. The teen d eclined the interview and stated she did not want to get the suspect in trouble. That day, the teen left the shelter and refused to return. She was brought back to th e shelter. DCFS indicated the teen's mother for lockout and substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and wel fare by neglect. Shelter staff reported the teen's behavior was out of control and pressured her placement worker to find a new placement for her. In October 2021, the teen was psychiatrically hospitalized foll owing an incident at the shelter. The shelter refused to allow her to return to their facility. The teen was discharged to the care of her godmother. Five days later, the godmother reported the teen was aggressive and refused to follow house rules. She requested another placement but did not demand the teen's removal. Six da ys later, the godmother reported the teen fled the home, but returned the following mornin g and was sent to school. The teen was then placed with her maternal aunt. She remained with the maternal aunt for over two weeks and the aunt reported the teen was doing well in her home. Child No. 65 DOB: 06/2021 DOD: 03/2022 Pending Age at death: 9 months Cause of death: Autopsy pending Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death; child of a former youth in care Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Ninemonthold medically compl ex infant was found unresponsive by his mother. The mother reported she had connected the infant to his feeding mac hine and turned it off when it was done early that morning. She found the infant unresponsive three hou rs later. At the time of the death, the mother, the infant, and the infant's then 21monthold sister w ere living with the mother's former foster parent while waiting for the mother's new apartment to be ready . A DCFS investigation of the infant's death remains pending. Reason for Review: At the time of the infant's birth, his mother was a youth in c are who resided in a transitional living program, and she was parenting the infant's then 11monthold sister. Her caseworker noted she reenrolled in school, participated in some services, and kept up with the s ister's appointments. In June 2021, she gave birth to the infant and graduated high s chool. The infant was born with medical complications and remained in the NICU for months following his birth. That fall, the mother found employment and moved into the hom e of the infant's paternal gra ndmother. The infant was discharged to his mother's care. In January 2022, the mother emancipated from DCFS. At that time, she was employed, cared for the infant and his si ster, and worked with a housing advocate to locate her own apartment. That month, DCFS received a report that the infant had been diagnose d failure to thrive. The infant had a genetic condition that resulted in a small jaw and difficulty eating by mouth and was fed exclusively via gtube. Hospital staff informed the CPI the infant had gained weight si nce admission to the hospital, was diagnosed with nonorganic failure to thrive, and was recommend ed for weekly weight checks. Hospital staff added the infant was ready for discharge, but they had be en unable to reach his mother and she had not come to the hospital in a few days. The next day, the CPI m et with the mother and the infant's then 19monthold sister at home. The mother stated she followed hos pital recommendations for the infant's feeding and demonstrated setting up his feeding machine. The mo ther stated the infant's paternal grandmother also cared for the i nfant. The paternal grandmother reported she did not know how to set up the feeding machine, and the infant's mother or father set up t he machine for her when she cared for the infant. In February 2022, medical staff reported the mother had b e e n b r i n g i n g t h e i n f a n t f o r h i s appointments and he had been gai ning weight. Two weeks before t he infant's death, the infant's paternal grandmother reported the mother left home with the infant sever al days earlier, following a verbal 94 altercation. The investigation re mained pending at the time of the infant's death. DCFS later indicated the parents for failure to thrive to the infant. Child No. 66 DOB: 04/2019 DOD: 06/2022 Pending Age at death: 3 years Cause of death: Autopsy pending Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Full investigation pending Narrative: Threeyearold was brought to the emergency room unresponsive where she was pronounced deceased. Medical staff stated the toddler was sever ely dehydrated, appeared malnourished, was the size of an 18monthold child, and lacked muscle tone. The father denied the toddler had any preexisting medical conditions. He reported the family had COV ID two weeks earlier, and the toddler did not get better. The parents have been arrested for child en dangerment. DCFS investigated the death and indicated the parents for death by abuse and death by negle ct. DCFS also indicated the parents for internal injuries by abuse and by neglect; cuts, bruises, welts , abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse and by neglect; malnutrition; and substantial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by abuse and by neglect. Reason for Review: Prior to 2015, the parents' older children were removed from t heir care and parental rights were terminated. The parents retained custody o f their children born after 2015. The parents had three years free of involvement with DCFS. In August 2021, DCFS received a report that the toddler's then 1yearold sister, who was medically complex and had been hospitalized since her birth, was nearly ready for discharge, but the parents were uncooperative with di scharge planning and visited the sister infrequently. The sister had been born at 29 weeks' gestation, displayed minimal brain function, had seizures, and required a trach and gtube. The CPI met with the family at home and documented observing three of the toddler's siblings. The parents stated they attend ed regular training for the sister's care but were unable to attend more than once per week due to financial and transportation constraints. Through the investigation, hospital sta ff reported they felt the parent s had become more engaged since DCFS became involved. Medical staff later reported the sister would most likely remain on a ventilator, and the plan was to have nurses care for th e sister in the home after d ischarge. Hospital staff reported the parents had completed their training, bu t the sister remained in the ho spital and did not have a discharge date. In December 2021, the mother gave birth to another child. That mon th, DCFS unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. 95 ACCIDENT Child No. 67 DOB: 06/2021 DOD: 07/2021 Accident Age at death: 2 weeks Cause of death: Complications of maternal trauma Reason for review: Open placemen t case at time of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twoweekold died at the hospital in the NICU. The mother had been struck by a motor vehicle while crossing the street, when she was 39 weeks pregna nt. The baby was born that day via emergency csection. He did not have a pulse for the first 13 m inutes of his life; medical staff resuscitated the newborn and placed him on life support. He was transported to another hospital for a higher level of care. He later met criteria for brain death and was removed fro m life support. DCFS investigated the newborn's death and unfounded the mother for death by abuse. Reason for Review: At the time of the baby's death, his mother had an open placem ent case for a 9yearold sibling who had come into care in 2017. For almost t wo years, the caseworker recorded no contact with the mother despite numerous attempts and diligent searches. In April 2021, DCFS received a report that the mother was pregnant, and the reporter was conce rned about her ability to care for the baby. DCFS did not take the report for investigation as the baby was not yet born but provided the information to the caseworker. In May 2021, the mother contacted the casewo rker to inform her of her pregnancy and of her plan to give her sister guardianship of the baby. She al so requested the sibling be placed with her sister if possible. The casewor ker requested the mother attend a child and family team meeting to discuss the plan, but the mother did not attend. The mother had no furt her contact before the baby's death. DCFS received a report the day after the birth because the newborn r equired a transfer to another hospital for a higher level of medical care and the mother was in critical con dition and unable to consent. DCFS identified the maternal grandmo ther as a surrogate decision mak er. Child No. 68 DOB: 04/2018 DOD: 07/2021 Accident Age at death: 3 years Cause of death: Drowning in swimming pool Reason for review: Two pending ch ild protection investigations at time of child's death; one indicated and two unfounded child protection investigations wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Threeyearold was found face down in the pool by his 16year old aunt, who jumped into the pool to pull him out and then called 911. The toddler's mot her had left the toddler in the care of his 16yearold aunt while she ran errands and had been out of the home for approximately 3540 minutes. DCFS investigated the toddler's death and indicated both the mo ther and 16yearold aunt for death by neglect and substantial risk of physical injury/environment inj urious to health and welfare by neglect because this was the second incide nt in which the mother had le ft the toddler with the aunt, and the aunt did not supervise. Reason for Review: The mother and her children lived with an adult maternal aunt and her infant child, and a teenage maternal aunt , who was in the guardianship of the adult aunt. In August 2020, DCFS opened an investigation against the adult aunt following a repo rt that she allowed her then paramour, who was using cocaine, marijuana, a nd alcohol and had a history of physically abusing the aunt, back into the home. Everyone in the home denied the paramour lived there. The aunt stated her paramour had come to the home intoxicated and battered her. DCFS indicated the inves tigation against the aunt for substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. In Octo ber 2020, 10 days 96 after the previous investigation closed, DCFS opened an investi gation against the adult aunt following a report that the home was full of garbage and dog urine, and the children were running around unclothed. The reporter called back later that day, wanting to recant the report. The CPI visited the family at their home and observed it to be clean and appropriate, and the child ren appeared safe. DCFS unfounded the investigation for environmenta l neglect. In March 2021, DCFS op ened an investigation against the toddler's mother after police found the then 2yearold toddler and his younger brother walking around the neighborhood unsupervised. When the police found the home, the adult aunt and the mother's paramour were home, but the aunt was asleep, and the mother's p aramour stated he was downstairs doing laundry. The paramour stated he d id not know the children could get over the safety gate and unlock the front door. He reported they ins talled a safety lock on the fro nt door after the incident. The mother was at work at the time of the incident and confirmed the paramour was supposed to be watching the children. The mother and her paramour separated during the investigation and DCFS unfounded the investigation against the mother for inadequate supervision and inadequate cl othing. In May 2021, DCFS opened an investigation against the adult aunt after the then 15yearold aunt admitted to using medication for self- harm. The teenage aunt received mental health services. DCFS at tempted to screen the case into court, but the State's Attorney declined to file a petition. The investiga tion was pending at the time of the death but was later unfounded. Three weeks before the death, DCFS opened an investigation against the teenage aunt after police found the toddler walking down the street alo ne, without shoes or pants. The investigation was pending at the tim e the toddler died. T he investigation was later unfounded agains t the teenage aunt. Family members confirmed the teenage aunt was supposed to be wa tching the children, and the teenage aunt stated they had all been watching television, but she went to her room, then found the toddler was missing when she returned to the living room a few minutes late r. Child No. 69 DOB: 03/2021 DOD: 08/2021 Accident Age at death: 4 months Cause of death: Blunt force trauma to the body Reason for review: Siblings returned home and unfounded child p rotection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fourmonthold was a passenger in his father's vehicle, along with his mother and 4yearold brother, while the father was fleeing from police at high speed and lost control of the vehicle. The vehicle crashed into a tree and a vacant house, and the inf ant and his mother were killed. The infant's 4yearold brother was treated for minor injuries at the hospit al and survived. The father fled the site of the accident on foot. There are criminal charges pending agains t the father. DCFS investigated the infant's death and indicated the father fo r death by abuse and substanti al risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Reason for Review: In July 2019, DCFS took protective custody of the infant's the n 5monthold, 1yearold, and 2yearold siblings. In September 2020, DCFS re ceived a report that the infant's then 1yearold, 2yearold, and 3yearold siblings, who were place d with their maternal aunt, were living with their mother and maternal grandmother. The CPI observed the chi ldren in their mothe r and grandmother's home on an unauthorized overnight visit. DCFS removed the child ren from the maternal aunt's home and placed them with their paternal grandmother. In November 2020, DCFS indicated the mother for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to he alth and welfare by neglect. In March 2021, DCFS received a report that the m other gave birth to the infant , and the staff had c oncerns because of her having four other children in the custody of DCFS. The family's caseworker reported the mother had completed parenting classes, was working toward reunification, and the caseworker had no concerns about the infant's safety in the mothe r's care. The mother's home was assessed to be safe, and the infant was discharged to her custody. That month, the mother began unsuper vised visits with her other children. DCFS unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physic al inju ry/environment injurious to health 97 and welfare by neglect. One week before the infant's death, the court returned the children to their mother's care, with the stipulation that the father was not to have contact with the children because he had not coopera ted with DCFS or completed any recommended services. Child No. 70 DOB: 03/2020 DOD: 08/2021 Accident Age at death: 16 months Cause of death: Asphyxia due to drowning Reason for review: Two indicated child protection investigation s and closed intact family services case within one yea rof child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sixteenmonthold was reported missing from her home around 10 :30pm. Her mother had last seen her approximately 15 minutes before she called 911 wh en she could not find her inside the home. The toddler's 5yearold sister stated she saw the toddler go o ut the front screen door, which was observed to be old, with a latch in poor condition. Multiple law enforce ment and fire department agencies searched for the toddler overnight. Early in the morning, her body was f ound in a nearby pond, and she was pronounced deceased at the scene. DCFS investigated the toddler 's death and indicated her mother for death by neglect and inadequate s upervision because the family knew the door was broken, and the toddler had left the home in a simil ar fashion two days earlier. Reason for Review: In June 2020, DCFS received a report about concerns of domesti c violence, drug use and mental health issues. Approximately one week later, DCF S received a subsequent call from the reporter, who stated they had seen a photo of the mother holdin g a methamphetamine pipe. The parents did not live together, and the fa ther did not cooperate with th e investigation. The mot her denied a current relationship with the father but did allow him access to the ch ildren. She admitted to using marijuana but denied methamphetamine use and t ested negative for methamphetam ine on a toxicology screening. The CPI did not observe any drugs or drug paraphernalia in the home . Law enforcement documented multiple dispatches to the home in the months before the investigation d ue to domestic incidents between the parents. The mother agreed to intact family services. In August 2020, DCFS opened an intact family case and indicated the parents for substantial risk of physical inju ry/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect to the toddler and her 3yearold sibling. The intac t case listed the father as a member of the case, but he did not engage with services, did not live in the home, and there was an active order of protection in place for the duration of the case. The mother re ported a history of using methamphetamine and cocaine. She submitted to random toxicology screenings, all of which were negative. She also completed parenting classes, participated in domestic violence counseling, followed safe sleep practices, and the children received early intervention services. In Decem ber 2020, while the intact case was open, DCFS received a report that the t hen 8monthold toddler was di agnosed with a nondisplaced linear skull fracture and hematoma. The mother had brought her to a local em ergency room due to fever and swelling to the right side of her head and she was released home after a n xray showed no injury. The next day, the mother brought her to a children's hospital after the swelling continued, where a CT scan showed the injury. The mother initially provi ded no explanation for the in jury but later stated the toddler hit her head on the faucet during a bath, her sibling struck her with a toy, and the toddler fell off a bed. The infant's grandfather stated he witnessed the first incident, and the gra ndmother witnessed the second and third; she stated the toddler slept in a twin bed for naps and had once ro lled off the bed, onto the hardwood floor. DCFS did not interview the father, and he had not seen the chil dren since October 2020. DCFS indicated the mother for head injuries by neglect and inadequate supervis ion. In March 2021, DCFS closed the intact case after the mother successf ully completed services. 98 Child No. 71 DOB: 05/2021 DOD: 08/2021 Accident Age at death: 2 months Cause of death: Probable suffocation Reason for review: Open intact family services case at time of child's death; one indicated and two unfounded child protection inves tigations within one year of ch ild's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twomonthold was found unresponsive after cosleeping in an a dult bed, with her parents, in a relative's home. The family called 911 but drove to the hospital before emergency responders arrived. The infant was pronounced deceased at the hospital. DC FS investigated the infant's death and indicated the parents for death by neglect. DCFS took protectiv e custody of the infant's siblings the day of her death. Reason for Review: In January 2021, DCFS opened an investigation nd 9yearold and 8yearold halfsiblings home alone. The 9year old sister told police their mother was at work, and they had no way of contacting her. The 8yearold bro ther stated their mother and the infant's father often left them home alone and he would call 911 from hi s tablet if there were an emergency. The mother arrived approximately five minutes later. Police officer s informed the mother that the family could not remain in the residence because there was no running water and other building code violations. The mother's other children were residing with other family members . Later in January 2021, while the investigation was pending, DCFS opened a second investigation a fter receiving a report that the home was uninhabitable. The CPI attempted a visit to the home that day a nd observed the home to be empty with a notice to vacate posted in the window. The next day, the CPI sp oke to the mother by phone, who reported they were evicted the day before due to the lack of running wat er and the family was staying with the infant's paternal grandmother. The CPI met with the family at t he paternal grandmother's home and told the mother she had submitted a No rman services request to pay t he outstanding water bill and o ffered her intact family services. The CPI assessed the grandmother's home to be safe. In early February, the investigation was unfounded for e nvironmental neglect and an in tact family services case was opened. In late February 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigation for inadeq uate supervision with the rationale that they could call 911 from their tablets and had since moved in w ith relatives. The family's intact family case included services for securing appropriate housing with op erable utilities. The intact worker discussed safe sleeping with the family as the mother admitted to coslee ping despite DCFS providing the family with a packandplay. Throughout the case, the family continued to experience homelessness, living with friends and at hotels, and the sc hool reported attendance issue s. The mother refused to go to a shelter because the father could not stay with her, and she withdrew fr om the Section 8 program. In May 2021, at the time of the infant's birth, her meconium tested positive fo r cocaine and mariju ana, and DCFS opened a new investigation. The mother denied drug use since learning of her pregnancy and tested positive only for marijuana. She was offered substance use and mental health services through her intact case but declined these services. In late July 2021, the mother became u nresponsive to calls from the intact worker. The mother told the CPI she d eclined substance use services bec ause she did not believe her marijuana use was a problem. Four days before the infant's death, DCFS in dicated the mother for substance misuse by neglect after the CPI conducted a closing visit with the fam ily. The mother stated she intended to continue with intact family services and found a possible home. The children were ob served to be free of visible signs of abuse or neglect. 99 Child No. 72 DOB: 07/2021 DOD: 08/2021 Accident Age at death: 3 weeks Cause of death: Sudden unexplained infant death with cosleepin g Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Included in syste mic issue report; report to Dire ctor June 30, 2022 See Death and Serious Injury Investigation 13 Narrative: Threeweekold was found unresponsive at approximately 4:00am in her mother's bed, where they had been cosleeping. The father attempted CPR while the mother called 911. The newborn was pronounced deceased at the hospital. The mother admitted sh e frequently coslept with her children despite having a small crib in her room. A toxicology screening was positive for alcohol. DCFS investigated the death and indicated the mother for death by ne glect and substantial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect because she tested positive for alcohol and had been provided information on saf e sleep from multiple sources. Reason for Review: In September 2020, DCFS received reports that the newborn's 15 yearold paternal halfsister presented f or treatment at the hospital wi th a black eye and a head injury that required staples, appeared nervous to answer questions, changed her stor y regarding how she sustained the injuries, and her parents appeared intoxicated. The CPI made a good faith attempt to see the family that day, then documented no additional activity for two months. In November 2 020, the CPI spoke with the halfsister at school, who reported she and her friends found a golf cart w hile their families were camping and began driving it. She stated she was afraid of getting in trouble for riding the golf cart and tried to get off, but fell, hit her head, and began bl eeding. She stated when she tol d her parents, they did not want to take her to the hospital because they had been drinking, so a friend's m other drove the halfsister and the mother to the hospital, where she received seven staples. The halfsis ter reported that when she got in trouble, the father would take away her phone and the mother would yell at h er. The CPI observed the children were free of outward signs of abuse or neglect and the home was appr opriate. In December 2020, DCFS unfounded the investigation for cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions , and oral injuries by abuse with the rationale that the halfsister was nervous because she did something she knew she was not supposed to do, the parents sough t immediate medical attention, and the halfsister had no other injuries. Child No. 73 DOB: 03/2017 DOD: 09/2021 Accident Age at death: 4 years Cause of death: Multiple injuries due to pedestrian struck by m otor vehicle Reason for review: Child was a youth in care Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fouryearold was playing at the school playground when a car veered off the road and struck her. The child was transported by ambulance to the hospi tal, where she was pronounced deceased. DCFS did not investigate her death for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: The child came into care in 2017, shortly after her birth, and the child's older siblings were already in DCFS care at that time. In the year pr ior to the child's death, the mother had the child's 1yearold and 2yearold siblings in her care. DCFS op ened and unfounded three investigations of the mother during that time. The younger sibli ngs remained i n the mother's care, t he mother remained compliant with services, and her home was assessed as safe and appropriate. The mother received weekly unsupervised visits with the children in her home, and the chil d had sibling visits in her older siblings' foster home. At the time of her death, the child was placed in a licensed foster home. 100 Child No. 74 DOB: 09/2020 DOD: 09/2021 Accident Age at of death: Hypoxic ischemic e ncephalopathy due to drowning Reason for review: Indicated child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twelvemonthold died at the hospital, two weeks after she had been found unresponsive in the bathtub by her grandmot her, who had been babysitting. Th e grandmother stated she placed the toddler and her 2yearold brother in a bath, in water that was deep enough to cover the toddler's legs. She later left the children in the b athtub and went to the kitchen, approximately six feet away, to remove a juice box from the freezer and prepare a bottle for the toddler . The grandmother stated that she no longer heard the children playing, and she found the toddler lying on her back in the bathtub with her eyes closed. The grandmother attempted the He imlich maneuver, then attempted to blow into her nose because she could not tell if the toddler was breathing, then she called 91 1 and began chest compressions at the instruction of the 911 dispatcher. The toddler was placed on li fe support at the hospital and medical providers pronounced her brain dead. The toddler was removed fr om life support and died. DCFS investigated the toddler's death and indicated her grandmother for death by neglect and inadequate supervision to the toddler's 2yearold brother. Reason for Review: In September 2020, DCFS opened an investigation after law enfo rcement arrested the toddler's father following a domestic violence incident in the family's home while the children were present. The parents declined intact family services. In Novemb er 2020, at the close of the investigation, the parents no longer lived together. DCFS indicated the invest igation for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect b ased on law enforcement confirmation of the incident. Child No. 75 DOB: 05/2019 DOD: 09/2021 Accident Age at death: 2 years Cause of death: Drowning Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death Action taken: Included in syste mic issue report; report to Dire ctor June 30, 2022 See Death and Serious Injury Investigation 13 Narrative: Twoyearold was found at the bottom of a neighbor's pool. Mul tiple family members had been at the family home celebrating a birthday, and the mot her announced she had a headache and went inside to rest. Family members later realized the toddler was missing, so they began searching for her and called police. CPR was attempted after the toddler was pulled out of the pool, but they were unable to resuscitate her, and she was ta ken to the hospital, where sh e was pronounced deceased. DCFS investigated the toddler's death and unfounded the mother for d eath by neglect. Reason for Review: Three weeks before the toddler's death, DCFS received a report that the mother left for work with a friend and the father f ollowed them in his car, began hitting the vehicle in an attempt to break the window, threatened to kill the mother, then left w ith the toddler. That day, the CPI made a good faith attempt to see the family at home. There were no add itional investigative tasks documented in the case before the toddler's death. DCFS later indicated the f ather for substantial ri sk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect because he knowingly brought the toddler with him and got into an altercation. 101 Child No. 76 DOB: 10/2008 DOD: 09/2021 Accident Age at death: 12 years Cause of death: Craniocerebral blunt trauma Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twelveyearold was walking with her 11yearold sibling when a car left the road and struck her. The child was transported to the hospital. Medical staff reported she had sustained traumatic brain injury and had a low likelihood of making a meaningful re covery. Eleven days later, the child was removed from life support and died. DCFS did not investigate th e death for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: In August 2021, DCFS received a report that the child disclose d that she kicked her great aunt, then her great aunt's friend punched the child in the face, choked her, and threatened to kill her. The child told the reporter she felt safe in the home, exc ept when the great aunt's friend was there. The reporter stated the child's then 11yearold sister did not corroborate the events. The reporter told the CPI she spoke to the child the day of the incident and did not observe any injuries. The great aunt reported she had chronic obstructive pul monary disease, and the woman id entified as her friend in the report was her home health nurse. She stated she attempted to take the chi ld's phone away to encourage her to get ready for school, and the child kicked her, so the sibling call ed the home health nurse and the police. The CPI spoke with the sibling at school, whose statement aligned w ith the great aunt's statement. The child reported she accidentally kicked her great aunt and the home he alth nurse punched her in the nose approximately an hour before sc hool. Both children reported the y felt safe at home and denied their great aunt used corporal punishment. In September 2021, the CPI's sup ervisor noted the home health nurse was not an eligible perpetrator, as she did not live in the home an d was not in a caretaker role. The investigation remained pending at the time of the teen's death. DCFS later un founded the investigation for substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to health and welfare by abuse. Child No. 77 DOB: 05/2021 DOD: 09/2021 Accident Age at death: 4 months Cause of death: Asphyxia due to wedging between a wall and edge of a bed due to cosleeping in an adult bed with an adul t Reason for review: Open intact family services case and pending child protection investigation; two unfounded child protection inves tigations within one year of ch ild's death Action taken: Full investigati on; report to Director June 22, 2 022 See Death and Serious Injury Investigation 12 Narrative: Fourmonthold was found unres ponsive and wedged between an ad ultsized mattress and the wall. The mother called 911 and a neighbor attempted CPR un til paramedics arrived and transported her to the hospital, where s he was pronounced deceased. The mot her reported she placed the infant in the bed next to her the night before. The mother admitted to using marijuana and alcohol prior to going to sleep. A toxicology screening was positive for marijuana. A pac k-and-play was observed in its carrying case but was missing its mattress. DCFS investigated the infant 's death and indicated the mother for death by neglect. Reason for Review: In June 2021, DCFS received a r eport that the mother had an op en placement case in another state, involving two older siblings in foster care b ecause of mother's history of substance use and mental health issues. She was noncooperative with services and she fled to Illinois where she gave birth to the infant. The mother refused to give the other state 's child protective services access to the infant. The maternal grandfather, who lived in Illinois, reported the m other came to Illinois in April and moved into a shelter. Shelter staff reported the mother had been with them for approximatel y two weeks and she was cooperating with their program . The mother reported she fai led to complete services in the other state because of lack of transportation. She denied she was diagnosed with any mental health conditions. She reported she smoked marijuana which must have been laced with c ocaine. She reported she was on 102 probation in the other state and her probation officer did not know she had moved to Illinois. The mother agreed to intact family services. The CPI assessed the infant a s safe. DCFS opened an intact family services case and unfounded the investigation for substantial r isk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Recommended services included mental health and substance abuse assessments, random toxicology scr eenings and domestic violence classes. In July 2021, the intact worker arrived at the shelter for a scheduled visit and staff reported the mother and infant left a few days earlier. The intact worker found the infant in the care of his maternal grandfather. He disclosed that the mother was arrested for a domestic viole nce incident, and he picked th e infant up. DCFS opened a second investigation. The grandfather expressed willingness to care fo r the infant and the infant was assessed safe in his home. The next day, the maternal grandfather called the CPI to request assistance and stated the mother had been released from jail and was demanding the infant be returned to her care. The CPI directed the maternal grandfather to call police and met them at the hom e. The mother's toxicology was negative for all substances but agreed to leave the baby with the grandf ather. However, four days later, the grandfather told the intact worker he returned the infant to he r mother's care because he could no longer care for the baby without financial assistance. The mother was living in a motel at the time. The intact worker offered to provide a packandplay, which the mother dec lined, and the intact worker discussed safe sleep. The mother denied a llowing the infant to sleep in b ed with her. Two days later, the intact worker delivered the infant's bassinette from the grandfather's house, and the mother reported she did not need anything else. An hour later, the outofstate placement worker notified the intact worker that the mother was seen giving the infant water during a video call with the o lder children, and the mother stated she had run out of formula. DCFS opened a third investigation. The inta ct worker reported the mother received WIC benefits but had not attende d her appointments. The CPI pro vided formula, distilled water, diapers, and clothing. In August 2021, the mother moved out of the motel , into a shelter, but was evicted from that shelter and moved into another shelter. The intact worker repor ted the mother was not participating in services. The intact worker was directed to staff the mother's case with the State's Attorney due to her lack of compliance. The intact w orker made repeated efforts to contact the mother, but she could not be located. Nine days before the infant's death, DCFS unfounded th e third investigation for inadequate food; the second investigation remained pending. Two days later, the mother completed a toxicology screening that was positive for marijuana. I n the week before the infant' s death, the intact worker documented ongoing attempts to contact the mother and reengage her in ser vices but did not receive a reply. Two days before the death, the mother informed the intact worker she was out of town for a funeral but would not disclose where she was residing. DCFS later indicated the secon d investigation for substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Child No. 78 DOB: 05/2021 DOD: 10/2021 Accident Age at death: 5 months Cause of death: Asphyxia due to pr one sleeping position in soft bedding due to cosleeping in an adult bed with an adul t Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Full investigation; report to Director on June 17 , 2022 See Death and Serious Injury Investigation 6 Included in systemic issue repor t; report to Director June 30, 2022 See Death and Serious Injury Investigation 13 Narrative: Fivemonthold was found unresponsive in bed with his mother a nd 911 was called. He had last been seen alive approximately two hours earlier. The i nfant had recently been sick with respiratory syncytial virus a week prior to his death. DCFS investigated th e infant's death and unfounded the mother for death by neglect, environmen tal neglect, and substantial ri sk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. 103 Reason for Review: In September 2020, DCFS received a report that the infant's th en 6yearold maternal halfsister disclosed sexual abuse by her mother's par amour, the infant's father. The next day, the CPI made a good faith attempt to see the child and met with the children's maternal greatgrandmother, who reported the mother and her three children, then 3 through 6 years old, had moved in with her a few days earlier, after the incident with the paramour. The materna l greatgrandmother reported the child disclosed sexual abuse to her and the mother had filed for an o rder of protection, but the paramour had not yet been served. In November 2020, the CPI met with the family at their home and interviewed the child in the presence of her mother, and the child denied the abuse a nd reported she made it up. The children were noted to be free of visible signs of abuse or neglect. In February 2021, the mother reported they were still living with the great grandmother, and she had not kept t he order of protection, because she did not feel it was still necessary. The CPI interviewed the paramour, who denied the allegations. That month, DCFS unfounded the investigati on for sexual penetration. Child No. 79 DOB: 12/2001 DOD: 11/2021 Accident Age at death: 19 death: Combined fenta nyl and despropionyl fentanyl (4 ANPP) toxicity Reason for review: Deceased was a youth in care Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Nineteenyearold became unresponsive after eating candy at th e home of her foster mother's relative, initially thought to be because of a diabeti c coma. The youth was rushed to the hospital, where she was later pronounced d eceased. An autopsy determined she died from toxic levels of fentanyl. The youth's placement worker documented she had been inconsiste nt with medical treatment related to her diabetes and mental health. She was known to use marijuana, but no other substances were reported. DCFS did not investigate the youth's death. Reason for Review: The youth came into DCFS care in 2018, during an investigation in which her father was indicated for lock out after the youth ran away from home. At the time of her death, she was placed with a fictive kin caregiver. She had an almost 2yearo ld child, and her foster mother was reported to be a good support to her and her child. Child No. 80 DOB: 08/2021 DOD: 11/2021 Accident Age death: Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy due to position al asphyxia due to prone position within bassinette, with soft objects Reason for review: Closed intact family services case, one indi cated and one unfounded child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twomonthold was having difficulty breathing, so his father c alled 911. Medical staff reported the infant was stabilized at the hospital but had a br ain bleed and was unresponsive. He later was pronounced brain dead. Five days after hospital admission, he w as removed from life support and died. The infant had been born premature, at 33 weeks gestation, and had been treated in the NICU. At the time of the 911 call, the infant and his 1yearold brother were in the care of their father while their mother was working. At the hospital, the infant also showed signs of sever e dehydration. The infant's crib was observed to have a fullsize pillow, and the parents reported t hey placed the infant to sleep on the pillow that day because he preferred sleeping on his stomach on soft s urfaces. Service providers who worked with the family reported they h ad spoken with the mother at len gth about safe sleep practices. The autopsy revealed the infant died of suffo cation. DCFS investigated the infant's death and indicated the father for death by neglect, indicated the mother for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect, and indicated the parents for in adequate supervision. 104 Reason for Review: In November 2020, DCFS received a report that the mother did n ot bring the infant's then 7monthold brothe r to an orthopedic specialist a nd physical therapist for his legs being bowed, often forgot to give him his medication, and failed to t ake him to appointments. The brother had been diagnosed with failure to thrive at 6 weeks old and had be en hospitalized. Medical staff reported to the CPI that the appointment for his legs was delayed due to th e COVID pandemic, but the brother had been gaining weight, and they did not believe the mother was me dically neglecting the brother. In January 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigation for medical neglect. Fou r days after the investigation closed, DCFS received a report that police responded to a domestic dist urbance at the father's home, in the presence of the brother. Police made no arrests but noted the m other had a red area on her cheek. The father refused to meet with the CPI or provide a statement to D CFS. The mother disclosed the father had previously been physically violent. The mother disclosed that s he was pregnant and agreed to participate in intact family services. Four days into the investigation, DC FS received a report that the infant's then 8yearold maternal halfbrother had been caring for the 8mont hold brother and 6yearold maternal halfsister, who had a burn on her hand, because the infant's f ather no longer watched them. The CPI saw the children that day and verified they were safe and supervise d. The mother reported that when she worked, the 8yearold went to h is father's home and the infant 's maternal aunt watched the 8monthold and 6yearold. The CPI noted the 6yearold's finger did not a ppear burned. DCFS received a similar report one week later. The infant's maternal aunt confirmed she watched the children while the mother worked. At the end of January 2021, DCFS opened an intact famil y case and identified service needs for counseling, housing, and possibly childcare. In March 2021, DCF S indicated the father for substantial risk of physical injury/environment in jurious to health and welfare by neglect because of the police report and the mother's statement. DCFS unfounded the mother for burns by neglect, inadequate supervision, and substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious. The mother did not comply with services during the intact case and in May 2021, the mother stated she wished t o withdraw from intact services. The intact team requested court ordered supe rvision, but the State's Attor ney's Office declined to file a petition, citing that the mother had been unfounded in the previous inves tigation. In July 2021, the intact worker learned the mother and 8monthol d brother were staying with th e infant's father, and the infant's maternal siblings were with their father out of state. The intact worker informed the mother she would close the intact case but needed to see the children before doing so. The mother stated the children were with their fathers, who would refuse to c ooperate with the intact worker, so the intact worker contacted law enforcement to request wellness checks on the children. Law enf orcement reported there had been no domestic disputes at the address of the infant's father since J anuary 2021. The mother agreed to bring the children for an inperson meeti ng with the intact worker, and t hey were noted to appear healthy. In July 2021, the intact case was closed , citing involuntary withdrawal . Child No. 81 DOB: 12/2020 DOD: 11/2021 Accident Age at death: 11 months Cause of death: Thermal injuries Reason for review: Two unfounded child protection investigation s within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Elevenmonthold died at the hospital with partial and full th ickness burns to 90% of his body. The infant, his mother, and her paramour were in a garage with a woodburning stove, and the infant had been placed in front of the stove. There was an explosion, and the infant was engulfed in flames. The infant was transported to the hospital, where he died later tha t day. Hospital staff noted the mother's speech was slurred and she appeared intoxicated. She tested positive f or methamphetamine. The paramour admitted he and the mother had used methamphetamine that mornin g. The mother had partial thickness burns to her hands, arms, and le gs. The infant's siblings were not in the mother's care at the time of the incident. DCFS investigated the infant's death and indicated th e mother for death by neglect and burns by neglect. 105 Reason for Review: In April 2021, DCFS received a report that the parents used me thamphetamine around their children. That day, police completed a wellbeing c heck and reported no concerns. The following day, the father admitted to the CPI that he used meth amphetamine the weekend before and attempted to use someone else's urine for a toxicology screenin g. The father reported the infant's 10yearold paternal halfbroth er and 11yearold brother atten ded school during the day and the infant's maternal aunt watched the infant while the parents worked. The mother reported she took the children out of state that weekend and the father was alone when he used met hamphetamine. The CPI assessed the children as safe at the home. The father signed shortterm guar dianship papers for the infant's paternal halfbrother, and the mother stated she planned to obtain an at torney to get full guardianship. The father was incarcerated for violating the terms of his probation. The mother reported she wi shed to move out of state, where she had more fam ilial support. In June 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to he alth and welfare by neglect because the father relapsed when the children were out of state, he was sen t to prison, and there were no concerns about the mother's ability to care for the children. In August 2021, DCFS received a report that the mother was using methamphetamine and had left the children with relati ves. During the investigation, the reporter stated she did not have eviden ce the mother was using drugs, as other people had told her. The mother stated she left the infant with a friend for one night, then sh e received a call from the paternal grandmother, who stated she planned to call DCFS. The mother's toxicology te sted negative for all substances. In October 2021, DCFS unfounded the i nvestigation for inadequate s upervision and substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Child No. 82 DOB: 05/2020 DOD: 11/2021 Accident Age at death: 18 months Cause of death: Blunt force injuries of the head due to a fall from the stairs Reason for review: Child was a youth in care; one indicated and one unfounded child protection investigations within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Eighteenmonthold fell down the stairs while in the care of a babysitter, her foster mother's adult daughter, while her foster mother moved. The bab ysitter reported the toddler fell down the stairs after she was startled, cried briefly, then became uncon scious. The babysitter took the toddler to the foster mother's home across the street and the family called 91 1. The toddler was transported to the hospital by ambulance, where she was pronounced deceased. DCFS investigated the toddler's death and indicated the babysitter for death by neglect, head injuries by neglect, inadequate supervision, and substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to h ealth and welfare by neglect. Reason for Review: At the time of the toddler's birth, her then 1yearold and 3 yearold sisters had been in DCFS care since March 2020 after their mother had an in dicated child protection investigation. The toddler came into care shortly after birth. After having su rgery for a g-tube placement she was placed with her godmother. In November 2020, DCFS received a report th at the toddler's then 4yearold sister was displaying sexualized behavior. In a forensic interview, th e 4yearold disclosed sexual molestation. DCFS indicated an unknown perpetrator for sexual molestation. I n February 2021, DCFS received a report that the toddler's then 2yearold and 3yearold sisters acces sed a bag of multivitamins while their foster mother was in the shower. The foster mother believed the 2year old may have ingested a few vitamins, so she took her to the emergency room where she was examined an d discharged. DCFS unfounded the investigation for poison and inad equate supervision with the ra tionale that the sisters' pediatrician stated the foster mother acted appropriately and locked all medication s and kept them out of reach of the sisters. The children's caseworker made regular visits to their foster h omes and their mother participated in parenting classes and therapy. In June 2021, the toddler's case was transferred to a private agency for specialized foster care due to her ongoing medical needs, and h er caseworker advised her foster mother on steps she needed to take to b ecome a licensed foster parent. 106 Child No. 83 DOB: 10/2015 DOD: 11/2021 Accident Age at death: 6 death: Multiorgan failu re due to hypoxicischemic enc ephalopathy due to drowning Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sixyearold medically complex child brought to the hospital a fter being found unresponsive and died days late r. In 2019, the child experience d a neardrowning in cident in a pond near her home. She never fully recove red and was intermittently hosp italized for the following two years. DCFS indicated her father for inadequate supervision after the incid ent. The child's medical history included congenital conditions and complica tions from her near drowning. She had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, quadriplegia, neurogenic bladder, dysautonomia, recurren t UTI, dystonia, acute respiratory failure, and hypoxic encephalopathy. DCFS investigated her death and ind icated her father for death by neglect because her death was ruled re lated to her near drowning. Reason for Review: Following the near drowning incident in 2019, the child and he r two foster siblings were placed with the paternal grandparents. In Novembe r 2020, DCFS received a report that the 1yearold foster sister left the house and was running down th e street, and the 3yearold foster brother came close to touching a hot barbecue smoker while at a family gathering. The CPI observed the children to be clean, dressed appropriately, and free of marks or bruise s. The paternal grandparents stated the foster sister left the play area but did not get far away and she was brought back quickly, and the foster brother did reach toward the barbecue smoker but was stopped before he touched it. The investigation was unfounded. In January 2021, the child's foster siblings were re turned to the mother's care. In February 2021, the family's caseworker reported the foster siblings were doing well since their return to the mother's home and the father w as still only allowed supervised visits. Child No. 84 DOB: 11/2007 DOD: 11/2021 Accident Age at death: 14 years Cause of death: Multiple injuries due to motor vehicle striking pedestrian Reason for review: Split custody Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fourteenyearold was crossing the street with a 12yearold f riend when he and his friend were struck by a motor vehicle. The teen died at the scene and his friend was taken to the ICU in critical condition. The driver of the vehicle was arrested on DUI charge s. DCFS did not investigate the teen's death. Reason for Review: The teen had lived with his grandmother since his mother's dea th in 2009. In 2019, DCFS took protective custody of the teen's then 16yearo ld brother on a dependency petition. The teen's brother experienced multip le placements since that time, including relative homes, group homes, incarcerations, and inpatient hospital stays. In May 2021, the family's case was closed because the brother's goal was set to independence. At the time of the teen 's death, the brother resided in a transitional living facility. Child No. 85 DOB: 07/2021 DOD: 12/2021 Accident Age at death: 4 months Cause of death: Asphyxia due to unsafe sleeping environment Reason for review: Child of a youth in care Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fourmonthold was found unresponsive. The infant's mother rep orted they drove the infant to the fire station, and he had no pulse on arrival, so CPR was started. The infant was transported by ambulance to the hospital, where he was pronounced deceased. The mother reported she fed him 107 approximately one hour earlier and fell asleep on the couch wit h him in her arms. The mother is a youth in care and was placed with the infant's paternal grandmother, but the family was on an overnight visit in the home of the infant's maternal grandmother at the time of th e infant's death. DCFS indicated the infant's mother for death by neglect. Reason for Review: The infant's mother came into DCFS care in 2019, when the infa nt's maternal grandmother was in an altercati on with a relative and stabbed t he relative several times. The maternal grandmother was reported to be noncompliant with recommended s ervices. In 2020, the mother was placed with the infant's paternal grandmother, a fictive kin pl acement. The mother was parenting the infant's then 1yearold siblin g and was referred to the Teen P arent Services Network for therapy, parent training/coaching, financial literacy training, and employment/ job training services. The mother communicated regularly with the caseworker through visits and v ideo chats. The home was observed to be clean and free of safety hazards, the infant and his sibling had their own separate sleeping arrangements, and none of the children had ever been observed to have marks o r bruises. The mother was cooperative and compliant with all services r ecommended for the children. T here is no record the infant's father was involved in services prior to the infant's death. Child No. 86 DOB: 07/2021 DOD: 12/2021 Accident Age at death: 5 months Cause of death: Overlay due to unsafe sleep environmen t Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation and s plit custody at time of child's death; unfounded child protection inves tigation within one year of chi ld's death Action taken: Included in syste mic issue report; report to Dire ctor June 30, 2022 See Death and Serious Injury Investigation 13 Narrative: Fivemonthold was found unres ponsive on a couch. His mother c alled 911 and began CPR. The infant was transported by ambulance to the hospital, w here he was pronounced deceased. The infant, his mother, and his 2yearold brother, fell asleep on a couch at the maternal grandmother's home while the mother was waiting for transportation to the shelter where she was staying. When the mother awoke, she found the 2yearold brother lying on top of the inf ant. The maternal grandmother stated she had gone to sleep because she did not feel well, and the infant 's maternal aunt was also in the home and was supposed to watch the infant's siblings. The DCFS investiga tion into the infant's death remains pending. DCFS also opened an investigation against the infant's maternal grandmothe r and unfounded her for inadequate supervision. Reason for Review: The infant's then 1yearold a nd 6yearold siblings came into DCFS custody in November 2020 and were placed with their maternal grandmother. The family's placement worker completed monthly inperson and virtual visits. The mother visi ted the children weekly. The 6yearold sister was referred for screening for a speech delay, and the 1 yearold brother was referred for physical therapy. The mother was referre d for parenting classes and indi vidual therapy. In December 2020, the mother reported she was pregnant. The father of the infant and 1yearold brother initially participated in visits but was not compliant w ith services. In March 2021, the father ceased communication with the placement worker. In May 2021, the then 7yearold sister's fat her had his paternity confirmed and was referred for parenting classes and domestic violence services, but he did not follow through. In July 2021, DCFS received a report of the infant's birth. DCFS opened an in vestigation to determine whether the infant could remain in his mother's care. The mother was compli ant with all services and the siblings' permanency goals had been set t o return home. DCFS unfounded th e investigation for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. The infant was allowed to remain in his mother's care. The placement worker continued regular vi sits and noted the siblings were doing well. The mother had unsupervised visits and was engaged in ser vices, but the placement worker noted her attendance at parenting classes became inconsistent followi ng the infant's birth. In October 2021, the mother reported to the placement worker that the infant's fathe r assaulted her, and she required medical 108 care. The father was arrested, and the mother obtained an order of protection. That same day, DCFS received a report that the mother had a sex offender living in her home and that the home was dirty. Thirteen days before the infant's death, the mother told the pl acement worker that the father broke into her home and set it on fire. She informed the placement worker that she was staying with friends and the maternal grandmother was caring for the infant until she found housing. That day, the CPI went to the maternal grandmother's home and observed the infant and his sib lings. The investigation and the siblings' placement cases remained open at the time of the infant's death . DCFS later unfounded the investigation for environmental neglect and substantial risk of physical inju ry/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Child No. 87 DOB: 03/2007 DOD: 01/2022 Accident Age at death: 14 years Cause of death: Heroin and fentanyl intoxication Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death; three unfounded child protection investigations within one year of child's deat h Action taken: Full investigation pending Narrative: Fourteenyearold was found unresponsive by her mother around 9:30am. Emergency responders found the teen in her mo ther's bedroom, wedged betwe en the wall and bed, and noted the home had dirty dishes in the sink, mouse traps, and stagnant water i n the bathtub. Three days earlier, the teen had tested positive for COVID. The mother reported she had woke n the teen from a nightmare around 4:00am and encouraged her to go back to sleep. DCFS investigate d the teen's death and indicated the mother for death by neglect, envi ronmental neglect, and substan tial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Reason for Review: In June 2021, DCFS received a report that the teen's mother an d her paramour used drugs, allowed a 20yearold neighbor to hit and disciplin e the children, and the children were malnourished. The mother denied d rug use and agreed to obtain a n order of protection against her former paramour, who she stated threatened to call DCFS when she ended the relationship. The CPI documented the teen, her 4yearold sister, and her 7yearold brother app eared healthy, free of marks or bruises, and denied witnessing their mother use drugs or alcohol. The CPI no ted there was adequate food in the home and no concerns about the envir onment. A neighbor reported no k nowledge of drug use in the home and stated the mother was a good parent. The CPI spoke with the mot her's former paramour, who recanted his report to the Hotline. In July 2021, while the first investigat ion was pending, DCFS received a report that the family home was unsanitary, had dead rodents, food left out , and had a foul smell. The next day, the CPI noted the home did not appear as described in the Hotline r eport and had no observable safety hazards. In August 2021, DCFS received a report that there were bags wit h a white powdery residue and straws hidden throughout the home, and there were domestic violence in cidents in the home, but the children were always outside and did not w itness the incidents. The repo rt was taken for additional information on the second investigation. Two days later, law enforcement repor ted to DCFS that they responded to a report of an altercation between t he mother and the former para mour. Law enforcement confirmed the mother obtained an order of protection against the former param our. That month, DCFS unfounded the first investigation for substantial risk of physical injury/env ironment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. DCFS unfounded the second investigation for inadequate supervision, environmental neglect, and medical neglect as mother had obtained an order of protection a nd had a negative toxicology screen. In November 2021, DCFS received a report that the teen, who had au tism, had been living with her father for four days, he left the teen alone 10 to 12 hours, and did n ot have appropriate food as the teen had allergies. DCFS opened a third i nvestigation. The father report ed he knew of the teen's allergies and provided appropriate food, the t een had a physical exam schedul ed for that day, and the teen did not have autism but had ADHD. The teen reported she felt safe with her f ather but uncomfortable in the home because she had never lived with only him; there was always food for her, her father asked a neighbor to 109 check on her when she was home alone, and she knew who to call in an emergency. The CPI observed adequate food in the home. The t een's paternal grandmother repo rted she picked the teen up at school daily and watched her until the father finished work. In Decemb er 2021, DCFS unfounded the third investigation for inadequate food and inadequate supervision. F our days after the third investigation opened, DCFS received a report th at the teen's mother had been arrested and law enforcement found drug residue in her car. The next day, the CPI found the teen's 5ye arold and 7yearold siblings home alone. A neighbor reported the children had been told to go to his hom e after school because the mother had to work, but the children denied being given those instructions. T he CPI interviewed the mother later that evening and the mother stated she arranged for the children to go to the neighbor's home after school, and denied the drugs were hers as she had borrowed the car from a f riend. The investigation remained pending at the time the teen died. DCFS later unfounded the investigati on for substantial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Child No. 88 DOB: 11/2021 DOD: 01/2022 Accident Age at death: 8 weeks Cause of death: Asphyxia due to unsafe sleeping environment Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Eightweekold was found unresponsive by his mother after he h ad been placed to sleep in an adult bed, between his parents. His mother called 911 whi le his father began CPR. The infant was transported to the hospital by ambulance, where he was pronounc ed deceased. The parents reported they placed him in bed instead of in his bassinette because he had b een congested and fussy in the days leading up to his death. Medical records noted the parents brought the infant to the emergenc y room approximately a week before his death for persistent diaper rash, and the tre ating physician noted the rash was likely caused by poor hygiene. Medical staff also noted the infant was underweight, in the first percentile for his age. DCFS investigated the infant's death and indicated the mot her and father for death by neglect. Reason for Review: Two weeks after the infant's birth, DCFS received a report reg arding a domestic violence incident between the parents. The next day, the CPI wa s unable to gain access to the family's apartment, but spoke to the mother by phone, who stated the inf ant was sleeping in his crib in a different room when the incident occurred. She and the infant left to sta y with family in a neighboring state. Law enforcement in the other state conducted a wellbeing check and observed the infant had a safe sleeping arrangement and was free of visible signs of abuse or neglect. Five days later, the CPI spoke with the father at the family's home, who stated the mother grabbed a kn ife and attempted to stab him. The CPI observed the home to be appropriate, with safe sleeping arrange ments for the infant, and completed domestic violence and substance abuse assessments with the fath er. DCFS later indicated the investigation for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious t o health and welfare by neglect after receiving police records that showed a history of domestic viol ence, the father violated an order of protection, and the mother was hospitalized twice following dom estic violence incidents. Child No. 89 DOB: 08/2004 DOD: 02/2022 Accident Age at death: 17 years Cause of death: Blunt trauma to the head due to motor vehicle c rash Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Seventeenyearold sustained f atal injuries while riding as a passenger in a car that struck a tree. Emergency services took the teen to the hospital, where she died of her injuries. DCFS did not investigate the teen's death. 110 Reason for Review: In March 2021, DCFS received a report that the teen's mother w as using cocaine in the presence of the teen. The mother initially agreed to a t oxicology screening, but later declined and stated she previously used cocaine and her children were remove d from her care, but she completed services and her children were returned to her. She admitted to relapsing and using cocaine a few weeks prior but stated she wanted to maintain sobriety had not used i t again. The teen denied her mother used cocaine and reported she did not fear her mother. The school an d a collateral contact reported the teen had been doing well recently and her primary care provider had no c oncerns. Nine days after the Hotline call, DCFS unfounded the investigation at the initial stage for subst antial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfar e by neglect because the teen den ied her mother used co caine. Both the teen and her mother declined services. Child No. 90 DOB: 12/2021 DOD: 02/2022 Accident Age at death: 2 months Cause of death: Positional asphyxia due to prone sleeping in an unsafe sleep environmen t Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Two monthold was found unresponsive by her mother, who called 911. The mother reported she had been breastfeeding the infant around midnight, fell asleep, and awoke several hours later to find the infant was on her stomach and not breathing. DCFS i nvestigated the infant's death and unfounded the mother for death by neglect. Reason for Review: In January 2022, DCFS received a report that the infant's 12y earold brother told classmates he could not play video games because there were coc kroaches inside his game console, and the reporter was concerned about the cockroaches around the inf ant. That day, the CPI met with the family at home. The parents admitted they had seen cockroaches in thei r home, they had set traps and used bait for the past week, and they clean ed regularly. The CPI observed no insects in the home. The infant and her 21monthold, 4yearold, and 12yearold siblings appeared healthy, clean, and appropriately dressed. The 12yearold brother stated he had last seen a cockroach the prior week. The 4yearold brother reported no concerns. Medical staff in the office of the children's prim ary care provider reported no concerns for abuse or neglect. Eighteen days before the infant's death, the CPI returned to the home and the parents reported the home was consistently treated, and they had not se en any insects. The CPI discussed safe sleep with the mother, and the children again appeared healthy, clean, and free of injuries. The investigation remained pending at the time of the death. DCFS l ater unfounded the investigation for environmental neglect. Child No. 91 DOB: 09/2021 DOD: 02/2022 Accident Age at death: 5 months of death: Asphyxia due to wedging Reason for review: Two pending child protection investigations at time of child's death Action taken: Full investigation pending Narrative: Fivemonthold was found unrespons ive between couch cushions b y his mother. His maternal grandfather began CPR an d the family called 911. The i nfant was transported by ambulance to the hospital, where he was pronounced deceased. The mother stat ed the infant usually slept in his pack- and-play at night, but he had w oken up, so she picked him up an d they both fell asleep on the couch. She confirmed a CPI had educated her on safe sleep and provided a p ack-and-play. DCFS investigated the death and indicated the mother for death by neglect. Reason for Review: Five days after the infant's birth, DCFS received a report tha t the mother left the pediatrician's office before tests were completed for the infan t, and the mother did not bring the infant for a scheduled appointment. The reporter noted the infant's biliru bin levels were above the 75% range and 111 could cause developmental delays if left untreated. That day, t he CPI met with the mother at home, who reported she had transportation barriers. During the home visit , the mother rescheduled the appointment and confirmed she had transporta tion. The CPI completed a home safety checklist, found no safety issues, and observed safe sleep arrangeme nts. In January 2022, while th e first investigation remained pending, DCFS received a report that the 20yearold mother, who lived w ith the infant's maternal grandparents, arrived home intoxicated and in itiated a physical altercation w ith the maternal grandmother while the infant was in the room. Police were called to the home and witn essed the mother grab a phone from the maternal uncle while holding the infant, and the phone hit the infant, causing him to cry. The mother was arrested for domestic battery. The mother told the CPI that she was arguing with the maternal grandmother when the maternal uncle intervene d and hit her first. She state d the infant was sleeping during the incident and was not injured, and it was the first time an incident like that had occurred. She denied drinking alcohol but admitted to using marijuana. The maternal grandparents repo rted they were concerned when the mother returned home because she was not acting like herself, s o the maternal grandmother confronted her, the incident escalated, and the maternal grandmother attem pted to restrain the mother so she could not hurt anyone. The grandparents reported the infant was sleep ing in another room at the time. The maternal uncle reported he had b een sleeping during the inciden t and his girlfriend woke him. He stated he grabbed the mother when the argument turned physical, but th e mother kept fighting, and the grandparents also attempted to end the fight. He reported no in cidents had occurred before and he did not see the infant during the alter cation. While in the home, the C PI did not observe safe sleep arrangements for the infant and was informed t he infant slept in bed with hi s mother. The CPI discussed safe sleep with the family and provided and helped set up a pack-and-play. Both investigations remained pending at the time of the infant's death. DCFS later unfounded the first inve stigation for medical neglect with the rationale that the mother brought the infant to his rescheduled appointment and his bilirubin levels had reduced. DCFS indicated the second investigation for substantia l risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by abuse with the rationale tha t the mother was witnessed acting recklessly. Child No. 92 DOB: 06/2004 DOD: 03/2022 Accident Age at death: 17 years Cause of death: Massive internal injuries due to single vehicle acciden t Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Seventeenyearold died in a car accident. DCFS did not invest igate the teen's death for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: In July 2021, DCFS received a report that the teen and her 16 yearold brother were involved in a physical alter cation with their stepfather. The reporter stated the stepfather shoved the teen when she attempted to intercede, and the brother then hit the stepfather and fled the home. All members of the family shared accounts of the incident that conc urred with the Hotline report and neither the teen nor her brother were in jured. The children were assess ed as safe because the brother was identified as the aggressor. The family reported no additional incidents b etween the stepfather and the children. The family reported the teen's brother continued to have behavioral issues but the parents refused services. The CPI completed a domestic violence screening with the mother and advised the stepfather to complete anger management services. In September 2021, DCFS unfounded th e investigation for substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to health and welfare by abuse and by neg lect. 112 Child No. 93 DOB: 04/2018 DOD: 03/2022 Accident Age at death: 3 years Cause of death: Blunt force head trauma due to pedestrian struc k by a semitractor trailer truck Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Threeyearold was struck and killed by a semitruck after he l eft the family's apartment while in his father's care. The m other was not home at the time . The toddler was pronounced deceased at the scene. The father stated he placed the toddler on the floor in the living room, then went into his own bedroom to watch videos using headphones, and he did not hear t he toddler leave. Law enforcement reported they found the main door unlocked and the father was i n a room with the door mostly closed. He was unaware the toddler was gone. The father reported the toddl er had a history of escaping from the home, so they installed a safety knob inside the main front doo r. The parents also reported the lock on the sliding porch door had been broken since they moved in, so they secured it with a rod, but law enforcement observed the rod was not in place. The father admitted to drink ing one to two beers earlier in the afternoon and there were empty beer cans in the room. DCFS investigated t he toddler's death and indicated the father for death by neglect. Reason for Review: In February 2021, law enforcement responded to a report that t he family home lacked heat and hot water, the toddler slept in a car seat, and the toddler had not been bathed in a week. Law enforcement stated the home was dirty with trash piled up, the father admitted to putting the toddler to sleep in a car seat and heating the home with an electric he ater. The CPI met with the family and observed the home to be warm with running water, but dirty and cluttered with beer cans in the parents' bedroom, and a broken water heater. The parents stated they hea ted water on the stove to bathe the toddler. The CPI determined the home needed cleaning but was safe. One w eek later, the CPI observed the home to be cleaner, and the parents were scheduled to receive a new water heater that week. DCFS unfounded the investigation for environmental neglect. Child No. 94 DOB: 03/2022 DOD: 04/2022 Accident Age at death: 2 days Cause of death: Complications of prematurity due to placental a bruption due to maternal trauma; significant contributing conditio n of motor vehicle collision Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twodayold died in the hospital where he had been born premat urely, by emergency csection, at 29 weeks gestation. His mother had been a passeng er in a vehicle involved in a police chase and accident. The newborn was treated in the NICU following his birth. His toxicology screening came back positive for barbiturates. D CFS investigated the death and unfounded the mother for death by neglect but indicated her for substantial risk of physical injury/envir onment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Reason for Review: In June 2021, DCFS received a re port that the mother and her p aramour were involved in a domestic dispute dur ing which the paramour struck and beat the mother with a gun, the mother jumped out of a window to escape, and the newborn's then 1yearold sister and 4yearold brother were present. The mother and the siblings were examined at a ho spital; the siblings were discharged to their maternal grandmother the same day, but the mother remaine d hospitalized. The 4yearold brother was observed to have bruising, a brasions, and marks to his face and medical staff re ported the 1yearold did not sustain any injuries. T he mother reported she had known the man who beat her for approximately five years and had dated him for a short period of time, but he was not her paramour, and they had no history of domestic violence. She stated she asked the former p aramour for a ride to t he mall and grocery store. He agreed to take them, then brought them to his house b ecause he stated he did not have his keys. He then struck and dragged the mother into his home, hit and ch oked the 4yearold brother, held a gun to 113 the brother's face, stated he woul d kill him, and hit the 1yea rold sister in the leg. She stated the incident continued the entire night. She stated the former paramour also attempted to shoot someone outside his home. The mother reported multiple unsuccessful attempts to get help and eventually jumped from an open second floor window, knowing she was unable to take her ch ildren with her, but she was able to call 911. Police arrested the former paramour. The mother sustained two broken bones in her pelvis and spinal injuries. In August 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigation for cuts bruises welts abrasions and oral injuries by abuse and substantial risk of physical injury/envir onment injurious to health and welfare by abuse because the exparamour was not an eligible perpetrator, as he was not the children's father, was not the mother's paramour, and was not placed in a caretaking r ole for the children. The former paramour was found guilty of aggravated ba ttery and sentenced to three y ears in prison. Child No. 95 DOB: 11/2005 DOD: 04/2022 Accident Age at death: 16 years of death: Complications of cocaine and benzodiazepine tox icity Reason for review: Open intact family services case at time of child's death; three unfounded child protection investigations with in one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sixteenyearold was removed from life support after being dec lared brain dead. He had been found unresponsive nine days earlier. The teen had a histo ry of drug use, prior overdose incidents, and hospitalizations for drug use. DCFS investigated the teen's death and unfounded his mother for death by neglect because the mother atte mpted to get him help multiple times. Reason for Review: In the year prior to his death, the teen was on probation, was hospitalized multiple times for drug use and overdose, was enrolled in multiple subst ance use treatment programs with which he was noncompliant, and police responded to the home multiple times for altercations between the teen and his mother. In April 2021, D CFS received a report that the teen had two emergency room visits and 911 calls related to drug use in the previous 24 hours, the mot her was verbally abusive, and the teen sustained a concussion when he in tervened in a fight between hi s mother and maternal grandfather. The mother denied hitting the teen and the teen stated he lied abou t his mother because he was angry at being hospitalized. One week later, the hospital discharged the teen into a 60day inpatient substance use treatment program, but he was discharged for noncompliance afte r 35 days. He participated in a twiceweekly virtual program. In June 2021, DCFS opened an inta ct family services case. The pattern of drug use, hospitalizations, failed treatment, and altercations with his mother continued. In September 2021, the intact worker staffed the teen's case with DCFS Clini cal to pursue additional services and assessments for the teen. In Dece mber 2021, DCFS received a rep ort that the teen and his mother had an altercation and she bit him. This was later unfounded after bot h the teen and his mother denied the allegation. In March 2022, the State's Attorney filed a petitio n due to the teen's failure to complete services. One week later, the t een tested positive for cocaine and benzodiazepine and was admitted to inpatient substance use treatment. Two days after discharge, hi s mother confronted the teen after she found pills in his room and an alterca tion ensued. Police transported the teen to the hospital, and he was medically discharged, but the mother refused to pick him up. DCFS opened an investigation for lock out, but the following day the mother agreed to have the teen discharged to her care and five days later DCFS unfounded the mother. Nine days before the teen's death, the te en had again overdosed and was hospitalized. Hospital staff reported he tested positive for ma rijuana, benzodiazep ines, cocaine, and alcohol and a CT scan showed little brain function. He remained hospitalized until his death. 114 Child No. 96 DOB: 01/2022 DOD: 04/2022 Accident Age at death: 3 months Cause of death: Asphyxia due to being found face down in a port able crib Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Threemonthold was found unresponsive and not breathing by hi s daycare provider, who called 911. The infant was trans ported by ambulance to the hosp ital, where he w as pronounced deceased. Paramedics reported the infant had dried blood around his nostr ils and in the back of his mouth. The daycare provider reported she put the infant down for a nap app roximately two hours before she found him unresponsive. DCFS investigated the infant's death and unfo unded the daycare provider for death by abuse and substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Reason for Review: In November 2021, DCFS received a report that the infant's 10 yearold brother had been involved in a physical a ltercation with another studen t at school, and the infant's father stopped the other student and the other student's sister when they were walking home from school. The CPI interviewed the other student and his sister, who reported the other student had been involved in a fight with the infant's brother. The n ext day, they were walking home from school, near the brother, when a man jumped out of a car and told the brother to punch the other student in the face a nd the brothe r did so. The student and his sister could not identify the man, but late r heard the brother say the man was his cousin. The CPI noted the brother was reluctant to speak and st ated his parents told him not to answer any questions about the incident. The 8yearold brother denied any knowledge of the incident. The school principal reported no major con cerns with either the 10yearol d brother or the other student. The parents both denied the incident. In January 2022, while the investigat ion remained pending, DCFS received a report that the infant tested p ositive for marijuana at birth. The report was taken for related information. In February 2022, the CPI visite d the home, obser ved the home t o be safe and appropriate, and discussed safe sleep with the mother. DCFS unfounded the father for subst antial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Child No. 97 DOB: 09/2020 DOD: 04/2022 Accident Age at death: 19 months Cause of death: Multiple blunt force trauma Reason for review: Three unfounded child protection investigati ons within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Nineteenmonthold was pronoun ced deceased at the scene of a t wocar accident. Newspapers reported the paramour of the toddler's father was dr iving and pulled over to the side of the road, where their vehicle was rea rended by another driver. DCFS did not investigate the toddler' s death. Reason for Review: In July 2021, DCFS received a re port that the father used coca ine and ketamine while caring for the then 9monthold toddler, the toddler had cigarette burns on his legs, and he often had clothing that was torn and wet with urine after visiting with t he father. The mother reported to the CPI that nine days earlier, the child had mouse bites on his face and st omach after the father returned the child to her. She stated she would not allow the child to visit the fath er until after their next family court date in August, and she agreed to bring the toddler to the doctor. The CPI assessed the toddler safe in his mother's care. The father denied the allegations, reported he had alread y scheduled a hair follicle toxicology screening because the mother had accused him of drug use, and s tated the mother violated the custody order because he had not seen the toddler in over two weeks. Co llateral contacts reported no concerns about the father's care, and the toddler's primary care provide r observed no injuries. In August 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigation for burns by neglect and subst antial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Ten days later, DCF S received a report that the toddler had bruises on his face and body after a visit with his father, and the father's home was crowded with animals and had a pest infestation. The mother stated the court had ord ered her to resume visits with the father. 115 She brought the toddler to the emergency room for an evaluation and the treating physician reported no injuries, but noted the toddler a ppeared to have a facial rash and mild diaper rash tha t was resolving. The mother stated she obtained an emergency order of protection aga inst the father. The CPI visited the father's home and observed no signs of infestations. The father denied t he allegations, reporte d the court held the mother in contempt for denying him visits. Nine days after the Hotline report, DCFS unfounded the investigation for burns by abuse; cuts, bruises, welts, abrasio ns, and oral injuries by abuse; environmental neglect; and substantia l risk of physical injury/environment in jurious to health and welfare by neglect. In November 2021, DCFS received a report that law enforcement resp onded to the mother's home for a report that the then 14monthold toddler cried for two hours. The reporter stated police found the door open; the toddler was alone, had a full diaper, and was crying in his crib; and the mother and her paramour appeared intoxicated and drug para phernalia was observed throug hout the home. The mother denied the door was open and stated she had called the landlord because th e door jamb was broken, and she and her paramour believed police had for ced the door open. Both the mot her and paramour denied using marijuana around the toddler and reported they kept all related items out of reach. The toddler was assessed safe. The probation officer of the mother's paramour reported the par amour tested negative for all drugs, had previously served time for battery to the mother, but had compl eted services and reported things were going well in the home. The la ndlord reported no concerns about the family and stated he had no knowledge of the door being damaged prior to the incident. In D ecember 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Child No. 98 DOB: 04/2022 DOD: 05/2022 Accident Age at death: 4 weeks Cause of death: Asphyxiation due to airway obstruction in unsaf e sleep environmen t Reason for review: Open intact family services case at time of child's death; two indicated and two unfounded child protection inves tigations within one year of ch ild's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fourweekold was found unresponsive in her parents' bed by he r mother around 7:30am. The mother called 911 and began CPR. The infant was transported by ambulance to the hospital, where she was pronounced deceased. The mo ther reported she awoke at 4 :00am, removed the infant from her bassinet, and returned to bed with the infant's father and laid the infant on her chest. DCFS investigated the infant's death and indicated the mother for death by neglec t. Reason for Review: The father was the alleged perpetrator in investigations invol ving children with two different women. In August 202 1, DCFS opened two investigat ions involving the infant's parents. The first investigation was ope ned after an altercation between the parents at the father's home and a report that the mother left the 8month old brother in his carrier in the street which both parents denied. The investigation was later unfounded. The second investigation inv olved reports that the father placed his fingers in the mouth of the infant's then 3yearold sister unt il she began choking and gagging, and that the father had previously hit the 5yearold brother. The fathe r denied the incident and the pediatrician had no concerns. The father was unfounded for substantial risk of p hysical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare. In Septembe r 2021 DCFS opened two investiga tions involving the father, the infant's paternal half sibling and that sibling's mother. Allegations in cluded behavioral h ealth concerns of the 8yearold and that the father was abusive to the child's mothe r. The halfbrother's mother downplayed the seriousness of the incident and refused to obtain an order of protection against the father. DCFS indicated both investigations against the father for substantia l risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. The paternal halfbrother's m other declined intact family services but accepted communitybased referrals . In January 2022, DCFS opene d an intact family services case. Recommended services included counseling, domestic violence ser vices, parenting education, and early intervention services for the infant's then 11monthold brothe r. The intact worker conducted weekly visits with the family. The mother repor ted she had an active order of protection against the father and was 116 pregnant with the infant. The intact worker discussed safe slee p with the mother and observed safe sleep arrangements for each of the children. In February 2022, the mo ther completed parenting classes. In April 2022, the mother began domestic v iolence classes and the intact worker's visits were reduced to biweekly because the family was cooperating with services. That month, t he mother gave birth to the infant and the intact worker discussed safe sleep with the mother and confirme d the family had a crib for the infant. The intact case remained open at the time of the infant's death. Child No. 99 DOB: 02/2005 DOD: 06/2022 Accident Age at death: 17 years Cause of death: Multiple injuries due to probable motor vehicle acciden t Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Seventeenyearold was brought to the hospital by friends. The teen's twin reported they had been in a car accident. DCFS received a report that the tee n and his twin required a transfer to a different hospital due to the severity of their injuries, but t heir father refused the transfer. The teen died of his injuries, and the father took the twin out of the hospital against medical advice. The reporter also stated the teen and his twin were involved in a gang. DCFS investigate d the teen's death. Hospital staff reported the teen needed transport to a trauma center but died before th e ambulance arrived. The mother reported she received a call when they were in the accident but was unab le to go to the hospital because she had two young children and called the father to send him to the hos pital. Both parents reported they were not informed of the seriousness of the injuries. The father and the twin reported the twin left the hospital on his own. Law enforcement was unable to locate an accident scene and reported they had been looking for the teen and his twin in relation to a possible carjacking. DCF S unfounded its investigation of the teen's death for death by neglect and medical neglect. Reason for Review: In April 2021, DCFS received a report that the parents allowed the teen and his twin to use and sell drugs and bring guns into the home which w ere left in reach of the teen's then 2yearold sister. The mother reported the father did not live in the home and denied the allegations. She added they lived in Section 8 h ousing and received inspections from the housing authority. The CPI noted no concerns on the home safety checklist. Both the teen and his twin denied the allegations. The CPI observed the twin with casts on his f oot and arm. The twin repo rted he was in a car accident in December 2020 and was in a coma for 10 days. Local police reported they arrested the teen in February 2021 for aggravated unlawful use of a weapon but had no other involvemen t with the family. A collateral contact reported no concerns. DCFS unfounded the investigation due to i nadequate evidence to support the allegations. Child No. 100 DOB: 07/2021 DOD: 06/2022 Accident Age at death: death: Anoxic encephalopathy due to asphyxia (unsafe s leep environment) Reason for review: Closed intact family services case and unfou nded child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Tenmonthold was found unresponsive, in an adult bed, by his maternal grandfather. He was brought by private car to the hospital, where he was intuba ted, then airlifted to a children's hospital. Two days later, he was remove d from life support and pronounced deceased. The grandfather reported he fed the infant, the infant fe ll asleep, and he placed the infan t in an adult bed with a stack of comforters around him to prevent him from falling off the bed. The grandfa ther reported he then went to a neighbor's home. He was out of the home for approximately 40 minutes. The infant's 8yearold brother was playing outside at the time. Another 18yearold grandson was in the ho me at the time, but the grandfather did not 117 tell him he was leaving, and he was not responsible for the chi ldren. The mother reported she had a packandplay for the infant, but when he stayed with his grand father, he would sleep on the grandfather's bed while the grandfather slept on the sofa. The DCFS investiga tion into the infant's death remains pending. Reason for Review: Upon the infant's birth in July 2021, DCFS received a report t he mother tested positive for marijuana, but hospital staff had no medical conce rns for the infant and did not observe withdrawal symptoms. The report was not taken for investigation . One week later, DCFS received a report that the infant was sent to the hospital for failure to thrive due to rapid weight loss and was discharged the same day with strict guidance to take the infant to see his pri mary care provider and return to the hospital the following day, but the mother refused to bring him back to the hospital. The CPI saw the family at home that day, and the mother reported she was in pain from giv ing birth to the infant by csection, and was not supposed to drive, but had no one to help her. The CPI helped the mother make an appointment. The infant's 8yearold sibling reported feeling safe at home. The infant was observed sleeping in a bassinette and the CPI documented discussing safe sleep with th e mother. The CPI spoke to the infant's medical providers, who reported the mother had been following u p with his care, he was gaining weight, and they did not believe the infant was medically neglected. Th e mother agreed to intact family services. In September 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigation for medical neglect. At the beginning of the intact case, the family was living with the children's maternal grandf ather. The intact worker made regular visits to the home and assisted in obta ining an IEP for the 8yearold sibling. The mother obtained a new pediatrician for the infant and brought him for his appointment s consistently. In May 2022, DCFS closed the intact case as su ccessful because the mother cooperated wit h services and obtained housing. Child No. 101 DOB: 04/2020 DOD: 06/2022 Accident Age at death: 2 years Cause of death: Drowning in a swimming pool Reason for review: Closed intact family services case and unfou nded child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Full investigation pending Narrative: Twoyearold was found face down in an aboveground swimming p ool at his aunt's home. The toddler was taken to the hospital by ambulance and wa s pronounced deceased. The toddler had lived with his aunt since 2021, and she had obtaine d legal cust ody. The gate to the pool had been locked, but the fence appeared bent, as if the toddler climbed over it. The aunt reported the toddler knew he was not allowed to go to the pool without an adult and his floaties . The aunt and grandparents were in the front yard at the time of the incident, and the toddler's 8yearold and 15yearold cousins, and a cousin's friend, were inside the home. The aunt reported he was missing only for a few minutes. No one witnessed the toddler going to the pool, but the 15yearold cousin stated sh e had seen the toddler climbing the fence a few days earlier, though she did not tell the aunt about the in cident. DCFS investigated the toddler's death and unfounded the investigation for death by neglect. Reason for Review: In 2020, DCFS opened an intact family services case for the mo ther after the mother admitted to methampheta mine use and having unstable hous ing. Recommended services included substance use treatment, individual therapy, and housing assist ance. The toddler's then 5yearold maternal halfsister went to live with her father fulltime bec ause the mother lacked stable housing. The halfsister's father also offer ed to care for the then 1yearo ld toddler, but the mother refused. The toddler went to live with his maternal aunt. In June 2021, DCFS receive d a report that the mother was using methamphetamine daily while caring for the toddler and was leav ing the toddler with multiple family members because she lacked stable housing. The reporter added t he mother was living with a family member who also used methamphetamine, and the family member's c hildren were currently in foster care. The CPI and intact worker met with the mother at the home of th e maternal grandmother. The mother completed a toxicology screening, but the report noted the sampl e had been altered. The mother had failed 118 to complete several requested t oxicology screenings during her intact family case; the screenings she did complete were negative. While the investigation was pending, th e intact worker spoke with the aunt about obtaining guardianship for the toddler. The intact worker had r equested that a neglect petition be filed but the State's Attorney did not rep ly. In August 2021, DCFS unfoun ded the child protection investigation for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to he alth and welfare by neglect due to insufficient evidence to support the allegation. In September 2 021, the State's Attorney stated they had not yet reviewed the petition. That month, DCFS closed the inta ct family services case unsuccessfully because the mother could not be located and was not engaged in any services. The toddler continued to live with his aunt until his death. Child No. 102 DOB: 10/2004 DOD: 06/2022 Accident Age at death: 17 years Cause of death: Blunt trauma of the head due to motor vehicle c rash Reason for review: Two pending child protection investigations at time of child's death Action taken: Full investigation pending Narrative: Seventeenyearold was a passenge r in a vehicle driven by a fr iend when the car hit a utility pole. The teen was not restrained in the vehicle and di ed from his injuries. The friend was arrested and charged with DUI. DCFS did no t investigate the teen's death for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: In July 2021, DCFS received a report that law enforcement arre sted the teen's mother for battering the teen. The CPI met with the teen and hi s older sister at the si ster's home. The teen had visible scratch marks on his neck. He stated his mother was angry because his uncle had made treatment decisions regarding his grandmother's care. Both the teen and his sister denied the mother had ever attacked them prior to the incident, and both reported the ir mother had been sober, but they believed she was drinking again. The sister and her paramour were not pr esent for the incident . The sister reported she was the mother's power of a ttorney, and the mother had cirr hosis of the liver and heart failure. Family members reported the mother had a history of psychiatric hospit alizations, the teen's grandmother had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and was in hospice care, and the teen's older brother had died of an overdose two years earlier. The sister's home was ob served to be free of safety concerns, and the teen was assessed as safe in th e sister's care. Four days l ater, DCFS received a report that the mother was admitted to a psychiatric hospital following her incarcerat ion. In August 2021, the CPI met with the mother at the hospital. The mother stated she had relapsed on a lcohol, blacked out, woke up in jail, and did not remember hitting the teen. She denied she had ever hit her children before. The mother stated the hospital had connected her with a psychiatrist and therapist an d she had appointments arranged following her discharge. The mother agreed to intact family services, but the case was not opened before the death. In October 2021, while the previ ous investigation remained pend ing, DCFS received a report that the teen was in a household with his mother, who had overdosed multiple times, and someone in the home was in hospice care. The CPI met with the teen at home, who stated his mother was hospitalized at that time, and the name given for his mother in the Hotline report was instead the name of his grandmother, who resided in a nursing home. The teen reported that one week earlier, his mother and grandmother both overdosed. It was believed they both overdosed on morphine, but not at the same time. He stated he lived in the home with his sister and his greatgrandmother, and the home appeare d free of safety concerns. In November 2021, the teen's grandmother died. Both investigations remained pending at the time of the teen's death i n J u n e 2 0 2 2 . D C F S l a t e r i n d i c a t e d t h e f i r s t i n v e s t i g a t i o n f o r cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse. DCFS unfounded the second investigation for substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to h ealth and welfare by neglect. 119 Child No. 103 DOB: 08/2015 DOD: 06/2022 Accident Age at death: 6 years Cause of death: Multiple blunt f orce injuries due to motor vehi cle striking fixed objec t Reason for review: Split custody Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sixyearold and six of his sib lings, ages 1 to 15, were passe ngers in a car driven by their mother when the car crashed into a median. The child was unrest rained, thrown from the vehicle and died four days later. Law enforcement reported only two children wer e wearing seatbelts during the accident. DCFS opened an investigation following the accident. The mother reported all children had been wearing seatbelts, and the 1yearold sister was in a car seat. She tes ted positive for alcohol and marijuana and was charged with an aggravated DUI and child endangerment. DCFS ind icated the mother for death by neglect; head injuries by neglect; internal injuries by neglect; bone fr actures by neglect; cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse and by neglect; and subst antial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Following the death , the court granted DCFS temporary custody of the surviving siblings. Reason for Review: In June 2022, two weeks before the child's death, juvenile del inquency court ordered the child's 16yearold brother to be held in juvenile detention for approximately six weeks, followed by three years of probation and ordered him into the c ustody of DCFS. Recommended services included mentoring, anger manage ment, trauma focused therapy, a nd family therapy with the mother, and brother to comply with probation recommendations. Four days lat er, the placement worker spoke with the mother, who stated she did not need services, and the father al so needed to be held accountable. At the time of the child's death, the 16yearold brother remained in detention and the placement case remained open. Child No. 104 DOB: 07/2019 DOD: 06/2022 Accident Age at death: 2 years Cause of death: Residential swimming pool drowning Reason for review: Open intact family services case and pending child protection investigation at time of child's death; one indicated and two unfounded child pr otection investigations, and closed intact family services case within o ne year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twoyearold was found face down in a pool. The toddler's pate rnal grandparents, who were caring for him at the time, reported the toddler had asked to go swimming, and the grandmother stated she would take him after she put dinner in the oven. A f ew minutes later, the grandparents found him in the pool; they pulled him out and called 911. He was tra nsported by ambulance to the hospital, where he was pronounced deceased. DCFS investigated the toddler 's death and unfounded the grandparents for death by neglect. Reason for Review: In December 2020, DCFS received a report that the father gave the child's 6yearold sibling marijuana. The investigation was unfounded, but the father agreed to an intact family services case. This case closed after the father completed serv ices. In June 2021, DCFS received a report that the toddler's halfbrother required stitches from playing on a trampoline at the mother's home. It was also reported that the mother burned the toddler on the face wi th a cigarette. The mother denied that she burned the toddler, and the investigation was ultimately unfoun ded. In August 2021, DCFS opened another investigation after receiving a report that the mother was usin g drugs. DCFS indicated the mother for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to he alth and welfare by neglect and opened an intact family services case. The intact worker implemented a sa fety plan for the halfbrother to be in father's care. In December 2021, DCFS received a report that th e mother, who was homeless, had been intoxicated while visiting with the child the prior weekend and had recently tested positive for 120 methamphetamine and marijuana. The father reported that he was seeking full custody of the halfbrother. DCFS later unfounded the mother f or substantial risk of physica l injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. In May, DCFS received a report that tha t the halfbrother had a circular mark on his arm while in the care of his father. The intact family serv ices case and child protection investigation both remained open at the time of the toddler's death. DCFS late r unfounded the father for burns by abuse. 121 NATURAL Child No. 105 DOB: 06/2021 DOD: 07/2021 Natural Age at death: 7 days Cause of death: Hypoxemic respirat ory failure due to extreme pr ematurity of 24 weeks gestation due to pulmonary hemorrhage; significant contributing condition s of grade 4 intraventricular hemorrhage, sev ere anemia, severe metabolic ac idosis Reason for review: Open intact family services case at time of child's death; indicated child protection investigation within one year of child's dea th Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sevendayold died at the hosp ital where he had been born and remained until his death. The newborn and his twin sister were born premature, at 24 week s gestation, and the newborn was intubated and cared for in the NICU. The newborn's mother had n o prenatal care and tested positive for marijuana, but the infant's urine toxicology screening was nega tive. DCFS did not investigate the newborn's death. Reason for Review: In November 2020, DCFS received a report that police responded to a verbal disturbance at the hotel the family was living in, and the newb orn's siblings, then 7 months, 2 years, and 4 years, were present. The newborn's 4yearold brother brought the responding officer to the window, where he observed the parents fighting. Police reported there w as an active warrant for the mother's arrest for a seat belt and child safety restraint citation, but they d id not arrest her due to her financial and parental status and overpopulation of the county jail. Police also repo rted the room had a bad odor, and there was trash and food on the floor. The parents admitted to a verbal a rgument but stated they left the room because they did not want to argue in front of the children. DCFS indic ated the parents for inadequate supervision and substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious t o health and welfare by neglect. The parents agreed to intact family services, and DCFS opened the intact ca se at the close of the investigation. The recommended services included hous ing, daycare, and domestic vi olence services. The intact workers noted the parents were wary of caseworkers and minimally cooper ative and not receptive to all services offered. Ten days before the newborn's birth, the mother admitt ed she was six months pregnant and had been afraid to disclose her pregnancy to the intact worker. In June 2021, the newborn and his twin sister were born by emergency csection, and the mother reported the t wins would remain hospitalized for at least three months. The intact ca se remained open at the time o f the newborn's death. Child No. 106 DOB: 02/2002 DOD: 07/2021 Natural at death: of death: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Reason for review: Deceased was a youth in care Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Nineteenyearold was pronoun ced deceased at the hospital foll owing an asthma attack that started while he was playing basketball. The teen used his inhaler, but he still could not breathe. Someone called 911, and he was transported to the hospital by a mbulance. DCFS did not investigate the teen's death. Reason for Review: The teen came into care of DCFS at the age of 6 years. He expe rienced 16 placements while in care, includi ng three hospitalizations. In 2014, the teen was placed in a specialized foster home where he remained until his death. The teen's foste r parent reported he was appropriate in the home, stable in the placement, and he had regular contact with his caseworker. At the time of his death, the teen's permanency goal was independence, and he had been ma king progress toward that goal. 122 Child No. 107 DOB: 02/2021 DOD: 07/2021 Natural Age at death: 4 months Cause of death: Viral pneumonia with bronchitis, meningitis, an d myocarditis Reason for review: Open intact family services case and pending child protection investigation at time of child's death; unfounded child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fourmonthold was found unresponsive around 7:00am. The mothe r reported she awoke at 5:00am to feed him a bottle a nd placed him back in his pack andplay around 5:30am. Emergency medical services transported the infant to the hospital, where he was pronounced deceased. DCFS investigated the infant's death and unfounded the investigation for death by neglect following the results of the infant's autopsy. Reason for Review: In May 2021 DCFS received a report that the infant's 11year old cousin, who was in the care of the infant's parents, frequently came to sch ool with bumps on his head and was recently observed with lacerations on the side of his face. The mother r eported that her nephew, who was nonverbal and visually impaired, had been sent to the United S tates by his mother, who could no longer care for him. School personnel reported that the minor had been observed running into things and hitting his head during school hours. They denied concerns of abuse but felt the family needed support due to the child's special needs. The investigation was unfounded for cuts , bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by neglect against the infant's mother, and an intact family se rvices case was opened. In June 2021, DCFS received a second report after the mother brought the infant to a crisis nursery to be cared for while the infant's cousin was in surgery. The infant was observed with cr adle cap, scratches from long fingernails, and poor grooming. The CPI saw the infant at the nursery and ob served him to be clean and wellnourished, but documented cr adle cap and multiple scratche s. The CPI observed that the home appeared clean and other six children in the home, ranging in a ges from 1 year to 11 years, appeared wellgroomed and free of any pers onal hygiene concerns. The inv estigation was pending at the time of the infant's death. The investigation was later unfounded. Child No. 108 DOB: 11/2004 DOD: 07/2021 Natural Age at death: 16 of death: Left ventricular hypertrophy Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sixteenyearold was at an amu sement park with his family when he began to walk slowly, stumbled, and collapsed. He was transported to the hosp ital, and medical staff were unable to revive him. The teen had a histo ry of developmental delay and p ossible fetal alcohol syndrome. DCFS did not investigate the teen's death. Reason for Review: The teen and his two older bio logical siblings lived with thei r paternal aunt, who had been their legal guardian since 2013. In April 2021, DCFS r eceived a report that the teen's 18yearold sister and then 18yearold brother were locked in their bedroo ms all day, with window s that were nailed shut, without phones to prohibit them from communicating with a nyone, and they were only allowed to leave their rooms to use the restroom or eat. Shortly after the initial report, DCFS received an additional report that the aunt did not pr ovide hygiene pr oducts to the si blings, bullied the children, did not approve of the brother dating a man, and she and her husband used alcoh ol and marijuana. The teen's brother, who shared his room with the teen, stated there was a latch on thei r door because he liked to sneak out at night, and he lost phone privileges fo r sending inappropriate pictures and videos. The teen's sister denied all the allegations in the report. All three youths stated they felt sa fe in the home, and the CPI observed no visible signs of abuse or neglect. The aunt stated the latch on the doo r was installed following an incident when 123 the brother snuck out at night, stole her car keys, and took he r car. She stated the latch was approved by DCFS as long as it was not a fire hazard. The aunt stated the b rother lost his phone privileges for sending nude pictures and videos to a man he met online, and after losi ng his phone, the brother took the sister's phone to contact the man. In May 2021, while the investigation was pending, DCFS received related information reports about the 18 yearold sister's mental healt h issues and her desire to leave the home. DCFS provided the sister with information for a shelter but did not take custody because she was an adult. The sister moved in with the bio logical mother. In May 2021, DC FS unfounded the inv estigation and the aunt and uncle expressed a willingness to continue caring for t he teen and his b rother. Child No. 109 DOB: 07/2021 DOD: 07/2021 Natural Reason for review: ild protection investigations at time of child's death; one indicated and two unfounded child protection investigations wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Included in syste mic issue report; report to Dire ctor June 30, 2022 See Death and Serious Injury Investigation 13 Narrative: Onedayold was born premature, at 35 weeks gestation, with a hole in his diaphragm. He died the following day. His mother received prenatal care and w as aware there would be medical issues. DCFS did not investigate the newborn's death. Reason for Review: In the year before the newborn's death, DCFS opened two invest igations regarding the newborn's mother, one investigation regarding the newborn's great grandmother, and two investigations of the mother's onceparamour and father of the newborn's halfbrother, who was 1 year old at the time of the newborn's death. In September 2020, DCFS received a report that the newborn's great grandmother was seen hitting the newborn's 7yearold sis ter on the back of her head during remote learning. The 7yearold, 6yearold, and 4yearold siblings s tated their great grand mother yelled but did not hit them, and they felt safe with their great grandparents, but they were afraid of their mother. DCFS unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physical in jury/environment injurious to health and welfare by abuse. In November 2020, DCFS received a report that the father of the newborn's then 8monthold halfbrother was on probation for battery charges, recently tested positive for amphetamines and cannabis, had lost significant weight, was getting sores on his face, and was spending substantial time with the 8monthold. The mothe r's then paramour admitted to re cent drug use. In January 2021, DCFS indicated the paramour for substa ntial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect due to his admission of using drugs. In December 202 0, while the investigation against the paramour was pending, DCFS recei ved a report that the newborn's mother molested her 15yearold cousin while babysitting her 12 y ears earlier. In February 2021 , DCFS unfounded the investigation due to insufficient evidence. In March 2021, DCFS received a report th at the paramour was arrested after a domestic violence incident, durin g which the newborn's halfsib lings were present. Police stated the arrest was his third for domestic violence, and they were called to th e mother's home at least once per month. The next day, the mother allowed the CPI to see th e 1-, 3-, and 5-year-old children at the door but did not allow her to interview them. The children were observed to be c lean and free of obvious signs of abuse or neglect. The mother reported the paramour did not live in the h ome. The child protection investigation remained pending at the time of the newborn's death. DCFS later indicated the paramour for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and wel fare by neglect. In June 2021, DCFS received a report that the newborn's 8yearold sister had brui ses on her inner thighs and a pinch mark and bruises on her arm. The reporter stated the mother pinched the 8yearold after the 8yearold pinched her 6yearold sister, but the mothe r told the reporter the bruisin g was from poison ivy. The investigation remained pending a t the time of the newborn's death the following month. CPIs made three unsuccessful 124 attempts to see the children before the newborn's death. DCFS l ater unfounded the mother for cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse. Child No. 110 DOB: 02/2021 DOD: 07/2021 Natural Age at death: 5 months Cause of death: Viral pneumonia with bronchitis Reason for review: One unfounded and one indicated child protec tion investigation and closed intact family services case within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fivemonthold was found unresponsive, on his stomach, in his crib, by his 15yearold mother. The infant's mother reported she fed him a bottle then placed him on his stomach in the crib approximately one hour earlier, and she had checked on him 30 m inutes earlier. DCFS investigated the infant's death and unfounded the investigation for death by abu se. Reason for Review: From June 2020 through May 2021, the mother's 5yearold pater nal halfsister was placed in a fictive kin foster home. In July 2020, DCFS ope ned an intact family services case for the mother's family after the infant's grandfather relapsed in his drug use and stopped assisting with parenting. In August 2020, the infant's then 14yearold mother reported s he no longer wished to live with her mother, the infant's grandmother, and went to stay in the home where the mother's paternal halfsister had been placed. The intact caseworker continued to assist her whil e she was out of the home. The mother received prenatal care. In November 2020, DCFS opened an invest igation against the infant's grandmother after she relapsed in her drug use, required inpatient hospital ization, and could no longer care for the 16yearold sister of the infant' s mother. The mother's 16year old sister went to stay with a relative. DCFS indicated the infant's maternal grandmother for substantia l risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect to the infant's moth er and the mother's 16yearold sister. In December 2020, the court ordered the return of the mother's 5y earold paternal halfsister to the care of her father, the infant's grandfather, and the mother decided to return to his care as well. In January 2021, the intact family services case cl osed as the infant's grandmot her no longer had her children in her care. In February 2021, DCFS opened an investigation of the infant's mother after the infant's birth because the mother reported she planned to live with her parents, who each had a history of drug use. The mother had moved back in with her father, who continued to participate in substance use treatment and completed negative toxicology screenings. The mother took the infant for his regular checkups, the infant's doctor reported no concerns, and DCFS ob served the home to be appropri ate. Eight days after the Hotline report, the investigation was closed as unfounded at the initial stage. Child No. 111 DOB: 12/2008 DOD: 07/2021 Natural Age at death: 12 years Cause of death: Perforation of the cecum due to complications o f chronic constipation Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Full investigati on; report to Director April 6, 2 022 See Death and Serious Injury Investigation 11 Narrative: Twelveyearold was pronounced d eceased at the hospital after going into cardiac arrest during surgery for an intestinal perforation. She had been admi tted to the hospital the day before for gastrointestinal issues including chronic constipation. At admi ssion, her abdomen appeared distended. DCFS investigated the child's d eath and unfounded the investiga tion for death by neglect and substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and wel fare by neglect with the rationale that the mother brought the child to the hospital when she was in pain, and there was insufficient evidence to support that she could have preve nted the intestinal perforatio n. 125 Reason for Review: In September 2020, DCFS received a report that the child and h er three sisters, then ages 6 to 15, h ad poor school attendan ce, the child could not attend school because she did not have an uptodate physical, and her 15yearold sister was not rece iving her medication for juvenile arthritis. The children reported their mother was gone at night and school staff reported concerns about the mother's mental health and possible substance use. The CPI met with the family and learned the child had not been seen by her primary care provider since before the pandemic, an d had a history of irregular bowel movements, for which t he mother gave her nat ural supplements. T he mother scheduled a school physical for the child. The mother reporte d the 15yearold sister had c ompleted lab work for liver function and was receiving treatment. The 15yearold sister watched the oth er children for short periods of time. The children reported they felt safe at home, denied physical abuse , and denied witnessing their mother use drugs or alcohol. A social worker at the hospital where the 15 yearold received treatment reported the sister required monthly treatment, but they had not seen her in over six months and had been unable to contact the mother or leave her voicemail messages. The childre n's primary care provider reported she had last seen the children in 2018. The child was prescribed a laxative for constipation and had been referred to a specialist. The CPI directed the mother to have a ll four children seen by their primary care provider and to take the 15yearold to the hospital for immedi ate treatment. In De cember 2020, the mother stated the children had seen their primary care provider. She s tated the child took laxatives and mineral oil for her gastrointestinal issues, but she was only able to g et her to take it twice per week because the child disliked the medication. The mother stated the 15yearol d was removed from her medication and was given an injection every six months for her arthritis. A co llateral contact reported no concerns with the mother's supervision or care for the children and their med ical issues. DCFS unfounded the investigation for medical neglect, inadequate supervision, and substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to h ealth and welfare by neglect. Child No. 112 DOB: 03/2007 DOD: 07/2021 Natural Age at death: 14 years Cause of death: Malignant neoplasm of connective tissue Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death; unfounded child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fourteenyearold died after sh e had been diagnosed with lung cancer and had been receiving treatment. DCFS did no t investigate the teen's death. Reason for Review: In February 2021, DCFS received a report that the teen's mothe r was physically violent with the teen during a fight with the teen's sibling, a nd the teen did not feel safe around her mother. At the time of the report, the teen was in the hospital for che motherapy and stated she wanted to stay with her maternal grandparents upon discharge. The teen's mother and 12yearold brother d enied the incident happened. The grandparents agreed to take the teen in after dis charge but stated they had no concerns about the mother. The teen's doctor reported no concerns and st ated the mother was consistent with the teen's treatments. A few weeks later, the teen reported she mis sed her mother and siblings and returned home. The CPI visited the teen at home, and the teen reported s he felt safe and recanted her earlier statements. In April 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by abuse. In May 20 21, DCFS received a report that the teen was readmitted to the hospital for pain and dehydration follow ing a surgery, and the mother brought the teen home from the hospital before receiving discharge paperwor k and oxygen for the car ride. The mother admitted to taking the teen home before receiving discharge pap ers and oxygen and stated the teen had never needed oxygen be fore. The CPI assessed the children as sa fe in the home, and the mother agreed to take the teen to urgent care to check her oxygen levels. The ur gent care provider reported the teen did not need oxygen at that time. The inv estigation remained pending at the time the teen died. DCFS later unfounded the mother for medical neglect. 126 Child No. 113 DOB: 07/2021 DOD: 07/2021 Natural Age at death: 0 days Cause of death: Multiple anoma lies in addition to trisomy 18 Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Newborn had been born with Trisomy 18, a known lethal anomaly, and died at the hospital approximately two hours after her birth. The newborn's mother r eceived prenatal care and medical staff had no suspicion of neglect or substance use. DCFS did not inve stigate the newborn's death. Reason for Review: In September 2020, DCFS receive d a report that the newborn's m other and six siblings, ages 1 to 11, lived in a home without running water; the mother and her paramour frequently drank alcohol and fought in front of the children; and the poli ce were often called to the home. The CPI met with the mother and paramour ; the mother reported her child ren lived with family members, but they did visit her home. She stated they had running water, but the pipes leaked in the b asement, so she turned off the water when it was not in use, and the municipality had recently turned off the water. The mother denied drinking, drug use and domestic violence. Her paramour d isclosed a history of domestic violence with the mother and stated the latest incident had happened thr ee months ago and resulted in him spending two days in jail. The children reported they used a neighbor's bathroom when they visited their mother. The children were all observed to be free of visible injuries. The maternal grandmother reported the mother spent a lot of time with the ch ildren at the grandmother's home . In November 2020, DCFS unfounded the investigation for environmental neglect and substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect because the children did not live with their mother, the children's caregivers reported no concerns about the mot her's care, and the children denied witnessing domestic violence between their mother and her paramour. Child No. 114 DOB: 11/2017 DOD: 08/2021 Natural Age at death: 3 years Cause of death: Respiratory distress due to cerebral palsy; sig nificant contributing conditions of hypoxia, ischemic encephalopathy, slow weight gain, and seizure s Reason for review: Open intact family services case at time of child's death; indicated child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Threeyearold medically complex toddler was found unresponsiv e after she had been put down for a nap. The toddler's m aternal grandfather called 911 w hile her mother performed CPR until paramedics arrived. She was pronounced deceased at the hospital . The toddler had diagnoses of brain injury at birth, cerebral palsy, and a history of failure to th rive. The family reported they provided her feedings and medications as usual in the days prior to her deat h. They stated they took the toddler to see her pediatrician three days earlier. DCFS investigated the deat h and unfounded the investigation for death by neglect. Reason for Review: In October 2020, DCFS received a report that the toddler arriv ed at the hospital with a laceration on the side of her head from an injury that o ccurred two days prior. Staff reported concerns as the child had limited mobility due to her medical c onditions. The hospital admitted the toddler for failure to thrive. Medical staff noted no other injuries. T he parents stated they noticed the injury a few days prior, thought it may have b een from a headband or barrett e, and attempted to treat it at home. In March 2021, DCFS indicated the investigation for cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by neglect with the rationale that the injury was not intentional, but the toddler was not mobile or verbal, had a complex medical history, and she was not brought to the ER im mediately. DCFS opened an intact family 127 services case. The toddler's primary care provider stated her o nly concern was the toddler's weight and that the family seemed to struggle sometimes with understanding how to use her medical machines. She later stated she felt the family needed better communication fr om the toddler's care team to reduce confusion and mixed information. The family's visits were held inperson weekly until July 2021, at which point they were reduced to every other week because the family was making progress in their services. Six days before the toddler die d, the family was informed their case would be closed and a final visit was scheduled for the day after the toddler's death. The intact fam ily services worker learned of the toddler's death when she arrived at the home for the final visit. Child No. 115 DOB: 10/2012 DOD: 08/2021 Natural Age at death: 8 years Cause of death: Multisystem organ dysfunction due to SARSCOV2 pneumonia due to E. coli urinary sepsis due to enterococcus urinary sepsis Reason for review: Indicated child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Eightyearold medically complex child died at the hospital, w here she had been admitted approximately one week earlier for multiorgan dysfunction synd rome, E. coli infec tion, an enterococcus saecalus uroseptis infection, and COVID pneumonia. The child ha d existing neurological delays, quadriplegic cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, obstructive slee p apnea, hip dysplasia, and profound intellectual disability. She required supplemental oxygen, a g tube for feeding, and other home medical equipment. The child's mother had been exposed to someone with COVID two weeks before the child's death and attempted to stay away from the child. Three days lat er, she noticed the child appeared unwell, so she took her for evaluation and found the child had COVID bu t stated the child had been okay. One week before her death, the mother noticed the child was having difficulty breathing, so she called 911, and the child was transported to the hospital. DCFS did not inv estigate the child's death for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: In June 2020, DCFS received a report that the mother failed to keep the child's medical appointments or refill her seizure medication. The moth er stated she had taken her to appointments prior to the COVID pandemic, but she felt it had become unsafe to do so, and she maintained contact with the hospital social worker. The family received inhome care du ring the day and overnight. The child was nonverbal but appeared jovial and free of injuries. The CPI ob served the child's medical equipment and adequate food for the child. The home was assessed as safe. The mother declined intact family services. In July 2020, the CPI submitted a nursing referral. The child's primary care physician stated the child's medical team communicated to ensure the child could be seen by all her providers when she was in the clinic, and they had become frust rated with the m other missing appointments and lack of communication with the treatment team. The child had an appointment scheduled for the following day, but the transportation company had canceled her transport. Medical staf f reported the child was scheduled for an appointment in August 2020. Three days before the appointment, the CPI met with the family to confirm the child would attend the appointment and the mother stated th e appointment was rescheduled for the following month. The CPI called and spoke with the medical staf f, who confirmed the child's next appointment had been rescheduled for September. The mother agai n declined intact family services and stated the difficulty with keeping appointments was due to unre liable transportation. The child's inhome nurses denied any concerns about the mother's care for the chil d. The CPI requested a courtordered intact family services case to monitor the child's medical appointment s and assist with arranging transportation, but the State's Attorney did not file a petition. DCFS indicate d the mother for medical neglect due to the severity of the child's medical conditions that could result in longterm damage if not treated appropriately. 128 Child No. 116 DOB: 06/2021 DOD: 08/2021 Natural Age at death: 6 of death: Cardiorespiratory arrest due to congenital hypo plastic left heart due to high risk following complex heart surgery Reason for review: Closed intact family services case and unfou nded child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sixweekold was pronounced deceased at the hospital after bei ng found unresponsive at home.

At the time of the investigation, the infant's mother and father lived together, a nd the siblings' mother came to pick up her children from the home. The father reported the paternal siblin gs' mother instigated the altercation, not the infant's mother. DCFS unfounde d the infant's mother and fat her for substantial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. The int act family services case closed in July 2021. Child No. 117 DOB: 11/2003 DOD: 08/2021 Natural Age death: 17 of death: Left ventricular hypertrophy Reason for review: Open intact family services case and pending child protection investigation at time of child's death; two unfounded child protection investiga tions within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Seventeenyearold died at the hospital where she had been bro ught during an asthma attack. During intubation, she stopped breathing and medical st aff had difficulty inserting the breathing tube due to food in her esophagus. DCFS did not investigate the teen's death. Reason for Review: In December 2020, DCFS received two reports on the teen's fami ly. The first report stated the mother's home had garbage and rotting food st rewn throughout, a pest infestation, and the teen and her 9yearold and 15yearold sisters possibly ha d lice or fleas. The mother denied environmental neglect and was able to navigate her home in her wheelchair. The relative who owned the home denied any concerns. The ch ildren appeared clean, with no signs of abuse or neglect, and reported having enough to eat. In March 2021, DCFS unfounded the investi gation. The second report alleged medical neglect to the teen's 15yearold sister because the sc hool reported that mother did not follow through with a Screening Assessment and Support Services (SASS) evaluation. The mother told the CPI she contacted SASS, but they did not come to the home. The sist er admitted to mental health concerns in the past year but denied present concerns and felt safe in the home. The 15yearold's physician stated the mother demonstrated appropriate concern and difficulties with s cheduling appointments were due to the COVID pandemic. In February 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigat ion. In June 2021, DCFS received a report that the teen's 15yearold sister had not received care for her diabetes since 2019, did not have a 129 primary care physician, had not had her asthma medication refil led, and the sister refused to attend school or participate with mental health services. The CPI met with th e family; the sister reported she had her asthma medication, and her school social worker was trying to l ocate a therapeutic school for her. The mother reported difficulty getting the sister to appointments b ecause of her own medical issues, and the sister sometimes refused to attend her appointments. The 9year old sister reported no concerns and appeared healthy. At the time of the investigation, the teen wa s living with a friend, but had frequent contact with the mother. The inv estigation remained pending at the time of the teen's death. DCFS later indicated the investigation for medical neglect to the teen's 1 5yearold sister. The family's intact family services case opened in July 2021, to assist the family with ma naging the sister's diabetes. The family continued to receive intact family services after the teen's de ath. Child No. 118 DOB: 02/2020 DOD: 09/2021 Natural Age at death: 18 months Cause of death: Complications of prematurity Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Eighteenmonthold was in the care of a maternal relative when she began having trouble breathing. The relative reported the toddler and her five sibli ngs had been in her care for four days. The toddler had a fever when she came to the home, which the mother attributed to teething. The toddler continued to worsen over the coming days, and the relative call ed 911 when the child had distressed breathing. The toddler was transported to the hospital, where s he died. The toddler had been born prematurely, at 25 weeks gestation, and had longstanding medica l conditions. DCFS investigated the toddler's death and unfounded the maternal relative for death b y abuse. Reason for Review: In August 2020, DCFS received a report that the toddler's 8ye arold sister disclosed that a family friend had exposed himself to her and m ade her remove her clothing. The mother reported the family friend was a former paramour with whom she remained friends, and he did not live in the home but had recently babysat . The mother contacted police, scheduled a forensic interview for the sister, and stated she would not allow the former paramour to s ee the children. In a forensic interview, the 8yearold reported she was not scared of anyone except for the former paramour. The family missed their additional forensic interviews and the mother had not responded to attempts to contact her. The former paramour was a registered sex o ffender who was noncompliant wi th weekly reports. His address in the sex offender registry was listed as \"homeless,\" and the CPI was unable to locate him for an interview. Police suspended their criminal investigation. In October 2020, DCFS unfounded the former paramour for sexual exploitation and substan tial risk of sexual abuse due to insufficient evidence and noncooperative witnesses. Child No. 119 DOB: 07/2021 DOD: 09/2021 Natural Age at death: 2 months Cause of death: Bacterial bronchopneumonia of the lungs Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death Action taken: Included in syste mic issue report; report to Dire ctor June 30, 2022 See Death and Serious Injury Investigation 13 Narrative: Twomonthold was found unresponsive at home by his mother, wh o called 911. The infant was transported to the hospital by ambulance, where he w as pronounced deceased. DCFS investigated the infant's death and unfounded the mother for de ath by neglect. Reason for Review: In August 2021, DCFS received a report that the family's home was uninhabitable, and the infant and his siblings were running aro und unclothed. The CPI met with the mother and observed the home to be clean and appropriate, with safe sl eeping arrangements, working utilities, 130 and food. The CPI did not see the children before the infant di ed. DCFS later unfounded the investigation because the home was found to be clean and orderly. Child No. 120 DOB: 08/2021 DOD: 10/2021 Natural Age at death: Bronchopneumonia a nd myocarditis due to systemi c viral infection Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Full investigation pending Narrative: Twomonthold was found not breathing around 7:30am by his mot her, who called 911 and attempted CPR. The mother stated she had last seen the infa nt alive around midnight, when she fed him and placed him on his back in a sleeper in the parents' bed . The sleeper had a hard barrier and was observed with two bottles, a pacifier, and blankets inside. Fir st responders noted it appeared the infant had been deceased for a while. In the three weeks before his death, the infant was seen by his pediatrician, who recommended adding formula ; he was brought to the hospital for difficulty breathing, where he was diagnosed with a viral upper respiratory tract infection; and h e received immunizations. DCFS investigated the infant's death and unfounded his parents for d eath by neglect. Reason for Review: In November 2020, DCFS received a report that the infant's mat ernal aunt left her three children, the infant's cousins, in the care of the in fant's parents while she went out of state. The cousins were then between the a ges of 4 months and 2 years. The reporter stated it was unknown when the maternal aunt would return, the maternal aunt knew the infa nt's father was a registered sex offender, the home was dirty with animal feces and urine, there was marij uana within the cousins' reach, and the then 4monthold cousin had not seen a doctor since birth. Thre e days after the report, following two good faith attempts to see the family, the CPI met with the maternal aunt at her home and observed the children. The maternal aunt stated the infa nt's mother had previously liv ed with her but had t o move out when she became involved with the infant's father. She stated the infant 's mother informed her the father came to the front door to drop off money, but he did not come inside th e home. The CPI completed the home safety checklist and marked the cousins as safe. In August 2021, the i nfant was born. That month, the CPI spoke with staff in the office of the cousins' pediatrician, who repo rted the then 13monthold cousin had not been seen since July 2020, but the then 2yearold and 3yearo ld cousins had been seen in April 2021 for school physicals, and the pediatrician reported no concerns. Fi ve days later, the CPI met with the infant's mother for the first time. The mother reported that at the time of the incident in November 2020, the infant's father, a registered sex offender, did not live with h er because the home was within 500 feet of a school. She reported the father had dropped off money and looke d for something in the shed but did not have access to the children at any time. She reported no plans to watch the infant's cousins in the future. The mother stated the father was on probation and could not hav e unsupervised contact with children under 18, but his probation officer and attorney were aware of the infant's birth and had not imposed any limitations. The CPI spoke with the father, who confirmed the m other's report. In September 2021, DCFS unfounded the parents for substantial risk of sexual abuse by n eglect. Child No. 121 DOB: 09/2005 DOD: 10/2021 Natural Age at death: 16 years Cause of death: Pulmonary hemorrh age due to pulmonary infection due to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sixteenyearold died at the hospital, where he had been admit ted five weeks earlier for ongoing medical issues. The teen had been born with a congenita l heart defect and had received two heart transplants during his life. DCFS did not investigate the teen' s death for abuse or neglect. 131 Reason for Review: In September 2021, DCFS received a report that the teen had be en admitted to the hospital, and it was reported that the teen had witnessed h is father punching his mother in the face, causing her teeth to fall out. The CPI attempted to interview t he teen at the hospital, but staff reported the teen was sedated and resting. The father was present at the hos pital and denied the allegations. The CPI later met with the mother, who reported she moved into a new ho me with the teen's 13yearold brother and reported she had been in the hospital for medical and menta l health issues at the same time the teen was hospitalized. She denied the allegations but admitted to pa st domestic violence issues and stated she no longer lived with the father. The mother declined intact fam ily services. The teen's brother stated he had never witnessed domestic violence between his parents, the father did not live with them, and he felt safe at home. The teen's maternal aunt was at the home and repo rted she was staying with the family to help the mother. She confirmed th e father no longer lived with the family, and the parents were no longer in a relationship. She stated she spoke to hospital staff about the father abusing the mother because she was concerned for the mother's safety. The CPI screened the cas e with the State's Attorney because the mother declined intact family services. The State's Attorney de clined to file for courtordered services. In January 2022, DCFS unfounded the in vestigation for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Child No. 122 DOB: 11/2018 DOD: 10/2021 Natural Age death: Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy due to hypovole mic and septic shock due to SAM syndrome Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death; unfounded child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twoyearold was vomiting, so his mother gave him Pedialyte an d took him to the doctor, who instructed the mother to take him to the hospital. The moth er reported they went home, the toddler collapsed, the mother began CPR , and called for an ambulance. T he toddler was transported to the hospital, where he went into cardiac arrest; he was transferred to a chil dren's hospital where a CT scan showed brain swelling. The toddler died three days later. The toddler had SAM syndrome, a rare and lifeth reatening genetic condition. DCFS did not investigate the toddle r's death for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: In February 2021, DCFS received a report that the toddler rece ived nursing care during the day but was left alone in the basement and not recei ving proper care at night, including feedings, application of ointment every tw o hours per physician's orders, and diaper changes. The toddler's mother denied the allegations and provi ded a letter from the toddler's medical specialist that stated the family was following the toddler's care and was experiencing harassment fr om the nursing agency. In March 2021, DCFS received a similar report. In April 2021, a supervisor at the nursing agency reported the agency had no concerns about the family, and a new nurse had been assigned to the family. The toddler's genetic specialist and primary care physic ian reported no concerns abou t the toddler's care. In April 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigation for medical neglect and inadequate supervision. In September 2021, DCFS received a report that the toddler's crib was soiled with dried vomit, and the toddler was dirty and was not receiving appropriate care when nurses were not in the home. Th e CPI observed the toddler and his crib to be clean. The mother reported she was trained to and did car e for her son, and the family had nurses in the home nearly 24 hours per day. The investigation remained pe nding at the time of the toddler's death. An inhome nurse who took care of the child in the days before his death reported his needs were being met and she had no concerns about his care. DCFS later unfounde d the investigation for cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by neglect and environmenta l neglect. 132 Child No. 123 DOB: 10/2021 DOD: 10/2021 Natural Age at death: 3 days Cause of death: Cardiogenic shoc k due to severe pulmonary hyper tension Reason for review: Two unfounded child protection investigation s within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Newborn died at the hospital three days after he was born by e mergency csection at 34 weeks gestation. An ultrasound had identified birth defects tha t required immediate intervention. DCFS did not investigate the newborn's death. Reason for Review: In September 2020, DCFS receive d a report that the newborn's t hen 4yearold maternal half-sister was being sexually abused by her father's wife. The sister made no disclosure during a forensic interview, her pediatrician reported no concerns abo ut her care in her father's home, and her therapist stated she had not made any outcries during individua l therapy. Law enforcement reported the mother and the sister's father had ongoing issues and frequent ly made reports against each other. In November 2020, DCFS unfounded the i nvestigation for substantial risk of sexual abuse and substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and wel fare by abuse. That same month DCFS received a report the mother's home had holes in the floor and broken windows, and there was domestic violence between the mother and he r paramour. The newborn's sis ter appeared healthy, clean, and unharmed. The mother told the CPI the sister lived with her dur ing the week and with her father on weekends. The CPI did not observe any broken windows but did ob serve an area in the living room where a rug covered a dip in the floor. The mother stated the sister knew to walk around the area, and her paramour stated they tried to get assistance from a community p rogram to repair the floor, but they did not qualify. The mother and para mour planned to fix the floor t hat weekend and five days later, sent the CPI photos of the repairs. In Ja nuary 2021, the mother reported she and the sister moved in with the sister's father. The home appeared safe a nd appropriate. In January 2021 , DCFS unfounded the investigation for inadequate shelter. Child No. 124 DOB: 01/2020 DOD: 11/2021 Natural Age at death: 21 months Cause of death: Respiratory failure due to congenital heart dis ease Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Oneyearold was pronounced decea sed at the hospital from medi cal complications. Her mother called 911 after she had started coughing and turned blu e during a bath. The toddler had been diagnosed with congenital heart disease and heteroataxy syndrom e, which affects the major organs. She had undergone at least six heart surgeries. DCFS did not invest igate the toddler's death. Reason for Review: In February 2021, DCFS received a report that the toddler was brought to the hospital by ambulance for fever and difficulty breathing. The c hild required use of a trach and feeding tube. Medical staff attempted to treat her and requested an amb ulance to transfer her to a children's hospital, but her parents refused the transport and drove her t o the children's hospital in their own car. The toddler was admitted to the PICU for stabilization and observat ion. The toddler's cardiologist reported no concerns for medical neglect because the toddler's mother had b een invested in the toddler's care since birth, had the necessary training to care for the toddler's com plex care, and had kept all appointments. The mother stated that on the day of the incident, EMTs transported her to the nearest hospital, despite her request that she be transported to the children's hospital, so when they were told she would need to be transported to the children's hospital, she became upset. Medic al staff involved in the child's care stated the mother had not refused treat ment as she sought medical care immediately and knew that the first hospital the child was transported to was not equipped to treat her. Hospital staff informed the CPI that the toddler would need wraparound services after discharge and a nursing referral was completed. DCFS unfounded the investigation agains t the mother for medical negl ect. 133 Child No. 125 DOB: 07/2018 DOD: 11/2021 Natural Age at death: 3 years Cause of death: Viral pneumonia, significant contributing condi tion of multiple congenital anomalies Reason for review: Open intact family services case and two pen ding child protection investigations at the time of death; one indicat ed child protection investigat ion within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Threeyearold was found unresponsive, in a prone position, wi th her trach not attached, by her home health nurse. The toddler was transported to the ho spital, where she was pronounced deceased. She had an extensive medical history, including Treac herCollins syndrome, a rare genetic disorder resulting in distinctive abnormalities of the head and face; low weight gain; chronic respiratory failure; cleft palate; hearing loss in both ears and anophthalm ia, the absence of one or both eyes. She required a trach due to an undersized lower jaw and a gtube fo r feeding. At the time of her death, she had an upper respiratory infection for which she was receiving oxyg en therapy. Her mother reported she heard noises coming from the toddler's room approximately an hour bef ore she was found unresponsive, but the noises were not uncommon for her. The mother believed the toddl er had gone back to sleep, and when she checked on her 30 minutes later, the toddler appeared to be sle eping. The autopsy report noted the toddler showed no signs of abuse or neglect. DCFS investigated the todd ler's death and unfounded her parents for death by neglect and substantial risk of physical injury/enviro nment injurious to health and welfare by neglect based on the findings of the autopsy. Reason for Review: In September 2020, DCFS opened an intact family services case for the family during an investigation that was later indicated for medical ne glect to the toddler. In November 2020, the intact worker documented the toddler was in a skilled nursing f acility following surgery and could not return home until nursing services were in place. The Division of Specialized Care for Children (DSCC) reported difficulty securing nursing services due to an ongoing roach infestation in the home, because nurses were concerned about roaches getting into her trach. In January 2021, nursing services were secured, and the toddler was discharged home. In March 2021, DC FS received a report that the toddler had missed multiple appointments, and the toddler's gtube had fallen out numerous times. During the investigation, the toddler misse d additional appointments and w eight checks. In May 2021, DCFS indicated the parents for medical neglect. In June 2021, the pe diatrician reported she knew the toddler had lost weight, so they were working with a specialist to determin e the cause, and the mother had become consistent with appointments. Dur ing an unannounced home visit, the intact worker found an inhome nurse was not present a nd learned the assi gned nurse refused to return to the home because of an ongoing roach infestation. The intact worker continued making weekly vi sits to the home and assured nursing services were reinstated. The family had also been offered hous ing services, counseling, and parenting classes, but the mother did not engage in services. In October 2021, the mother reported she no longer wanted intact services. The next day, DCFS received a report th at the toddler's 1yearold brother had bruises under both eyes, across the bridge of his nose, and on his forehead. The mother stated the bruises were from the toddler's 2yearold brother pinching him and fal ling from a bed. The mother stated she did not report the bruises or seek medical care because she did not think it was needed. The CPI advised the mother to take the 1yearold to the hospital that day, and his CT scan was negative for fractures. DCFS determined the intact worker would continue weekly visits as a result of the new investigation. The investigation remained pending at the time of the toddler's dea th. The investigation was later indicated for inadequate supervision and unfo unded for cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse. Three days before the child's death, DCFS received a report that the toddler's 1yearold brother had a large, plumsized bruise on his right upper arm and three peasized br uises on his left hip. The reporter stated the child did not have the bruises a few days before. The day b efore the toddler's death, the brother was taken for a medical exam, and medical staff did not have concer ns about the bruises but noted the large bruise was consistent with a bite mark. The mother provided inci dentreports from the brother's daycare 134 and maintained she did not know how the brother received the bi te mark. The toddler's 4yearold sister reported no concerns of her brot hers being intentionally injure d. The investigation remained pending at the time of the toddler's death, and was later unfounded for cu ts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse. Child No. 126 DOB: 05/2014 DOD: 11/2021 Natural Age at death: 7 years Cause of death: Escherichia coli sepsis due to diabetic ketoaci dosis - new onset diabetes due to large bowel necrosis Reason for review: Child was a youth in care; indicated child p rotection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sevenyearold was removed fro m life support after complicatio ns from type 1 diabetes. The child had been diagnosed with d iabetes just three days earl ier when his relative foster mother brought him to urgent care because of we ight loss and lethargy. He was transferred to the hospital, developed e coli, and became septic. The child went into cardiac arrest aft er emergency surgery to relieve the pressure from his enlarged stomach: he was revived and intubated. His co ndition deteriorated, and he had no brain activity. He was removed from life support at his family's requ est. DCFS did not investigate the child's death. Reason for Review: In October 2020, DCFS received a report that the child had bru ising on the left side of his jaw, abrasions on his right cheek and neck, and a h ematoma on his forehead. The child stated his stepfather kicked him and hit him with a metal cooking spoo n as punishment. DCFS took protective custody of the child that day. DCFS indicated the child's mothe r and stepfather for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect to the child and his 6monthold brother. The stepfather was al so indicated for cuts, bruises, w elts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse to the child. The children were placed in a licensed foster home w ith their maternal aunt. The stepfather was criminally charged with aggravat ed battery to the child. Recomm ended services included individual therapy, family therapy, parenti ng education, and parenting coa ching. The caseworker documented the child's parents participated in services and made satisfactory progress towards the goal of return home, but they continued to deny the a llegations. Two weeks before th e child died, a clinical staffing took place because the mother remained in a r elationship with the stepfathe r. Child No. 127 DOB: 08/2019 DOD: 11/2021 Natural Age at death: 2 years Cause of death: COVID 19 acute respiratory failure; significant contributing conditions of epilepsy, SPTAN 1 mutation, conge nital hypotonia, microcephaly Reason for review: Pending child p rotection investigation at ti me of child's death; closed intact case and unfounded child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twoyearold medically complex child died at the hospital from COVID pneumonia. The day before her death, the mother brought the toddler to the hos pital, and she was admitted to the PICU. The toddler had been born with a rare congenital disorder, SPTA N1 mutation; congenital hypotonia; microcephaly and intractable epilepsy. She required a feeding t ube and oxygen at night for obstructive sleep apnea. In the fall of 2021, her condition deteriorated, a nd her parents began palliative care and signed a DNR (do not resuscitate) order. DCFS did not investigate the toddler's death. Reason for Review: Following reports of domestic violence and substance use, an i ntact case was opened in June 2020. In December 2020, DCFS received a report t hat the toddler's 15yearold halfsister disclosed that the mother's former paramour sexually molested h er when she was 5 years old. Police 135 reported attempts to interview th e halfsister, but she did not cooperate. The CPI observed the former paramour's children and assessed them to be safe with their pat ernal grandparents, with whom they lived, and the former paramour agreed to stay away from the home durin g the investigation. The mother also agreed to keep the children in h er care away from the former pa ramour and stated the toddler's then 9yearold halfbrother, who was the former paramour's child, w as the only child who saw him regularly. During an interview at the Children's Advocacy Center, the 15y earold halfsister reported that 10 years earlier, the former paramour lifte d her shirt and rubbed her le gs and stomach while she was sleeping. She denied any penetration. The 9yearold halfbrother denied anyo ne ever touched him inappropriately. In April 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigation for sexual molesta tion and substantial risk of sexual abuse. In March 2021, after the parents had been uncooperative with se rvices, a court petition was filed, and the parents were court ordered to cooperate with services. The moth er reported plans to reapply for inhome nursing care for the toddler. The toddler had been hospitalized multiple times for viral infections, continued to have difficulty breathing, and her seizures were i ncreasing in frequency and duration. She was monitored by her primary car e physician as well as speciali sts. In April 2021, the toddler's 15yearold halfsister was psychiatrically hospitalized for two weeks afte r refusing to participate in outpatient mental health services. In May 2021, DCFS received a report that the 1 5yearold halfsister stated she did not feel safe at home. The other children reported feeling safe at home and stated the parents disciplined them by removing electronics and grounding them. The toddler was obs erved to be free of visible concerns. The investigation was unfounded. In June 2021, the toddler began re ceiving 56 hours of nursing services per week. That month, the father completed a domestic violence asse ssment and began classes. In October 2021, the mother had successfully completed domestic violence s ervices. The court ordered the case closed. The day before the toddler died, DCFS received a report that the toddler's father locked the 15yearold halfsister out of the home around 2:00am the night before, so she walked to a gas station to call her grandmother. The halfsister stated the father was the only adult home at the time because the mother was at the hospital with t he toddler. The investigation remained pending at the time of the toddler's death. DCFS later unfounded the i nvestigation for inadequate su pervision. Child No. 128 DOB: 07/2019 DOD: 11/2021 Natural Age at death: 2 years Cause of death: Complications of Williams syndrome Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twoyearold was found unresponsive, with his trach disconnect ed, after his ventilator alarm began ringing. His parents called 911 and began CPR, and he was transported to the hospital by ambulance, where he was pronounced deceased. The toddler had mu ltiple medical diagnoses, including Williams syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that includes growth delays, cardiac defects, and musculoskeletal defects; aortic valve stenosis, a condition tha t blocks blood flow in the heart; and liver issues. He had undergone several cardiac surgeries and required a ventilator and feeding through a g tube. DCFS did not investigate the toddler's death. Reason for Review: In December 2020, DCFS received a report that the toddler had been admitted to the hospital three days earlier and had unexplained bruising th at looked like handprints on his torso, legs, back, spine, and abdomen. The hospital later determined the bru ising was due to a blood platelet abnormality, and they did not suspect abuse. Doctors discharged the toddler to his parents. The inhome nursing service reported working with the family since the todd ler's birth and had no concerns of maltreatment. DCFS completed a nursing referral. In March 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigation for cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse. 136 Child No. 129 DOB: 10/2013 DOD: 11/2021 Natural Age at death: 8 years Cause of death: Renal failure due to resolving peritoneal absce ss as a consequence of peritoneal dialysis dependent end state renal disease Reason for review: Child was a youth in care within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Eightyearold was found unresponsive and not breathing in his bedroom while undergoing athome dialysis. The child had been diagnosed with kidney failure at birth. The child's mother called 911 and the child was transported by ambulance to the ho spital, where he was pronounced deceased. The coroner reported the child's d ialysis records showed his mo ther used the dialysis machine correctly. DCFS investigated the child's death and unfounded his mother fo r death by neglect. Reason for Review: The child came into DCFS care in 2019. In July 2020, the court returned the child to his mother's care, but his DCFS case remained open. His case worker continued weekly visits, and the agency's nurse continued monthly visits. In January 2021, the c hild had surgery to close an opening in his neck. In June 2021, he had a consultation for kidney transplant eligibility. In August 2021, the court closed the family's case and returned the child's guardianship to his mother. Child No. 130 DOB: 04/2021 DOD: 11/2021 Natural Age at death: 7 months Cause of death: Undetermined natural causes Reason for review: Open intact family services case at time of child's death; one indicated and one unfounded child protection inves tigation within one year of chi ld's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sevenmonthold began wheezing and gasping for air, so his mot her called 911 and he was transported to the hospita l, where he was pronounced deceas ed. The day before his death, the mother brought him to the hospital b ecause of congestion and labored b reathing. The baby was diagnosed with pneumonia, provided antibiotics, and discharged that evening. D CFS did not investigate the infant's death. Reason for Review: In April 2021, DCFS received a report that the infant and his mother tested positive for amphetamines and mar ijuana when the infant was bor n. The mother admitted to taking Adderall (amphetamine/dextroamphetamine) that was not prescribe d to her, and she reported she had mental health issues as a teenager. DCFS placed the infant and the 3yearold sister with a maternal aunt under a safety plan. The mother engaged with a substance use tr eatment program and declined intact family services. DCFS indicated t he mother for substance misuse by neglect and substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. In August 2021, police contacted DCFS when the infant's father reported the mother had left the infant in a carrier outside his apartment building, and he could not care for the baby. In addition, the mother told him she had thoughts of harming herself and the infant. The moth er told police she did not have transportation to pick up the infant. DCFS took separate reports on each parent. The father told the CPI h e could care for the baby for the next few days and declined services. The mother reported the father knew she was bringing the infant to his home and handed the infant directly to him. The mother admitted to t elling the father she wanted to harm herself but denied she said she would harm the infant. The mother compl eted a mental health assessment and began counseling and medication ma nagement. The family's primar y care physician reported no concerns with the mother's ability to care for the children and reported the infant was meeting his developmental milestones. The mother reported no plans to remove the 3yearo ld from her maternal aunt's care. DCFS unfounded the parents for inade quate supervision, and the mothe r was also unfounded for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect.

The toddler's paternal grandm other, with whom he was placed, reported that the day before he died, she took him to a wellness appoint ment with his pediatrician. She stated the clinic would not see the toddler because he had C OVID symptoms. The toddler was taken to the hospital, where he tested negative for COVI D and tested negative for all substances except those administered by the hospital.

The infant was placed on an extracorporeal membra ne oxygenation machine to support his heart and lungs and was on a list for an organ transplant when his organs began to fail. DCFS did not investigate the infant's death. Reason for Review: In 2020, the infant's siblings, then ages 5 months, 4 years, 1 2 years, and 15 years, came into care. The children we re initially placed together wit h their maternal grandmother, but later moved to separate relative and fictive kin homes. The mother pa rticipated in visits with the children, completed parenting classes and anger management classes, atten ded therapy, attended psychiatric assessments and services, and attended domestic violence servic es. In September 2021, DCFS opened a new investigation against the mother following the infant's bir th due to her history with DCFS.

The mother repor ted she fell asleep with the infa nt for approximately 30 minutes, and when she awoke, she found the infant on her back, unresponsive. The mother reported she had been living at a hotel with the infant and her 2yearold for approximately one week due to domestic violence, and the older siblings were with a relative. DCFS investigated the infa nt's death and unfounded her mother for death by neglect and medical neglect. Reason for Review: In October 2021, DCFS received a report that police responded to the family home for a domestic violence incident. The reporter stated the infant's father attempted to strangle the mother and the infant's 12yearold maternal half-brother, and both received medical care for injuries. Police arrested the father. The mother reported the incident wa s the first time he physically assaulted her or the children. The 12yearold reported he intervened when he observed the infant's father hurting his mother, and he believed both a dults sometimes drank alcohol. Th e 8yearold brother also witnessed the altercation. The CPI observed the infant and his 2yearold sis ter to be clean and appropriate. The children all reported they felt safe with their mother. The mother obtai ned an order of protection against the infant's father. The father denied phys ically assaulting the mother and children. The mother declined intact family services and stated she and her children planned to move in wit h her mother. One week after the first investigation opened, DCFS received a report that the infant wa s losing weight, and doctors had concerns about failure to thrive. The infant had medical complexities.

The newborn died approximately two hours after his birth. The twin died in the w omb and was considered a stillbirth. DCFS did not investigate the newborn' s death for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: The newborn's 18yearold mother lived with her mother, the ne wborn's maternal grandmother. The mother's seven siblings and the grandmother's paramour also lived in the home. In November 2020, DCFS opened an investigation against the grandmo ther, who had been arrested for being asleep at the wheel of a car, had a high blood alcohol level, l acked a valid driver's license, and was pregnant. In January 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect because no children were with her. However, DCFS opened an intact family services case for the family due t o the investigation. The grandmother's paramour moved out of the home after the intact case opened. Th e grandmother was re ferred for and began substance use treatment. The intact worker provided cribs and b aby equipment to the family, helped enroll the mother's siblings, who were under the age of 5, in daycare and Head Start, and re ferred the family for communitybased services for hous ing advocacy and transportatio n assistance. The family also participated in family counseli ng, and the grandmother particip ated in parenting classes. In September 2021, the intact worker learned the newborn's then 17yearold mother was pregnant and had applied for housing in the same complex where the grandmother lived. In Nov ember 2021, the grandmother completed substance use services. In December 2021, the grandmo ther requested that DCFS close the intact family services case. The intact case remained open at t he time of the newborn's birth and death.

The toddler's father and paternal aunt took the m other to work approximately 30 minutes earlier. The toddler had encephalopathy, spastic quadriplegic c erebral palsy, and a seizure disorder, and he required a trach. Medical staff noted he lived longer than e xpected with his conditions. DCFS investigated the toddler's death and unfounded the paramour for death by neglect. Reason for Review: In January 2021, DCFS received a report that the toddler's the n 5yearold brother had lost weight and asked for extra food at school, the toddler 's then 7yearold brother lacked a winter coat and had poor hygiene, the family lived in a onebedroom ap artment with six adults and four children, and the 5yearold brother reported he slept in a closet with a dults.

Her father's paramour called 911 and began CPR. The child was transported to the hospital by ambulance, where she was pronounced deceased. The child had a history of seizures si nce 2016. She had been taken to the emergency room seven times and w as admitted to the hospital twi ce, but none of her earlier seizures were deemed life threatening. Her paternal grandmother, who was her adoptive mother, reported she sometimes watched the child to assure she took her prescribed medication to manage her seizures, as the child did not like it. She stated the child had not had a seizure in over sev en months. The child had last been seen by 141 her neurologist November 2021, who noted her medication levels were appropriate. Medical staff noted that missing one or two doses of the medication could cause sei zures. The child had been staying with the paramour since the day before her death due to her paternal gra ndmother's work schedule, and the grandmother confirmed the child packed her medication. The para mour lived with her 6yearold and 12yearold children. Her 12yearold son later alerted her tha t he attempted to wake the child to play and found her bleeding. DCFS investigated the child's death and unf ounded the paramour for death by abuse. Reason for Review: The child came into care in 2016, at 4 years old, along with h er twin sister and then 2yearold brother. In 2020, the children were placed with their paternal grandmother.

The parents reported they had last seen he r alive approximately two hours earlier. She had been treated at the hospital a few days prior for possible food poisoning and was discharged the same day with an antibiotic and anti nausea medication. DCFS did not investigate the child's death. Reason for Review: In December 2021, DCFS received a report that the child's 17y earold sister was assaulted by her maternal uncle, who was intoxicated, and the s ister sustained knots on her head. The child stated the uncle also hit her, but she did not sustain any inju ries. The reporter stated the sister disclosed wanting to harm herself. Police arrested the uncle for domestic battery to the sister. The uncle did not live in the home. The mother was at work when the incident occurred and stated the uncle went to the home to bring groceries and found the sister and her friend smoking mar ijuana. The child stated her uncle started arguing with her sister, her sis ter and uncle were both hitting each other during the altercation. The child said she had never seen her uncle hit her sister before. The mo ther stated the sister frequently ran away from home and did not attend school. In January 2022, DCFS unfo unded the investigation for cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse and substantial ri sk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by abuse because the uncle did not live i n the home and was not in a caretaking role for the children and was theref ore an ineligible perpetrator. Child No. 139 DOB: 05/2020 DOD: 02/2022 Natural Age at death: 20 of death: Asphyxia due to febrilerelated seizure disorde r Reason for review: Child was a youth in care Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twentymonthold was found unresponsive in his crib. The foste r mother called 911, and he was pronounced deceased at the scene. Hospital staff reporte d the toddler had a seizure around 9:00pm the evening before but did not require medical attention. The f oster mother reported they put the toddler to bed around 10:30pm and checked on him one hour later. DCFS i nvestigated the toddler's death and unfounded the foster mother for death by neglect. Reason for Review: The toddler came into DCFS care at the age of 4 months. The mo ther never participated in services, and her whereabouts remained unknown throughout the toddler's involvement. The father completed an inpatient substance use treatment progr am but was inconsistent in maintaining 142 sobriety and visiting the child. In January 2022, the toddler's foster mother reported the toddler had a febrile seizure due to respirator y syncytial virus. She stated fevers triggered the toddler's seizures. The toddler was under medical care for the seizures. Child No. 140 DOB: 11/2020 DOD: 02/2022 Natural Age at death: 14 months of death: Cerebral palsy and epilepsy; significant contri buting conditions of viral upper respiratory tract infection, unsafe sleep environment (bedshar ing with blankets and pillows) Reason for review: Two unfounded child protection investigation s within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fourteenmonthold was found unresponsive by his mother. The t oddler had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, a seizure disorder, hypotonia, o bstructive sleep apnea, and was fed through a gtube. The mother called 911 and began CPR. The toddler died in the ambulance enroute to the hospital. Shortly before the death, the parents had separated, and the mo ther had been staying with a friend and the friend's 3yearold child for five days.

The mother stated she regularly coslept with the toddler, and she admitted to drinking the night b efore, but stated she had not b een drunk. The child required oxygen for his sleep apnea, but first responders observed no oxygen tanks. Med ical staff reported the toddler would have run out if he had been provided the oxygen as prescribed, and t here was no record his oxygen had been refilled. The mother admitted she did not always provide the ox ygen, and she did not take all of the toddler's medical equipment when she left the father's home. DC FS investigated the toddler's death and indicated his mother for death by neglect. Reason for Review: In August 2021, law enforcement responded to a call that the t oddler's 2yearold paternal halfbrother was found running around the neighborhood without supervision. At the time of the incident, the brother was in the care of his paternal grandmoth er, who stated the brother left the home while she was using the bathroom . The family installed a chain lock at the top of the door to prevent additional incidents. DCFS unfo unded the paternal grandmother f or inadequate supervision. In October 2021, DCFS received a report that the then 10monthold was adm itted to the hospital for seizures, and the father disclosed to hospita l staff that the toddler had not taken some of his medication for a few days. Medical staff reported the toddler had missed three appointment s in September 2021 and not seen his primary care doctor in over six months. Medical staff told the CPI the parents were observed to be appropriate with the toddler but did not appear to be educated on caring for his medical conditions. They also reported concern that the parents were not feeding him pro perly through his g-tube, as he was underweight. The mother told the CPI the toddler had been witho ut two of his medications for approximately one month. The mot her reported problems with tran sportation to the neurologist's office, which was three hours away, and they could not find one closer. Also, pandemic rest rictions forced them to try and find childcare for their other children while they a ttended appointments. She stated they also had financial barriers in affording the toddler's specialized f ormula. The mother reported the toddler had weekly physical and developmental therapy at home. Two weeks af ter the Hotline report, the toddler was discharged from the hospital. In December 2021, the CPI met wit h the family at home, observed beds for each of the children, discussed safe sleep with the mother, and observed no marks or bruises on the toddler or his siblings. The mother re ported the toddler had been doing well since re-starti ng his medication. She agreed to intact family services; a referral had been submitted , but the case ha d not yet opene d at the time of the death. The investigation was unfounded for medical negle ct. 143 Child No. 141 DOB: 09/2015 DOD: 02/2022 Natural Age at death: 6 years Cause of death: Hydrocephalus due to prematurity Reason for review: Closed intact family services case within on e year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sixyearold died in the hospital.

He was pronounced brain dead following a brain surgery complete d the month before. DCFS did not investigate the child's death. Reason for Review: In February 2021, DCFS closed an intact family services case t hat had been opened in 2020 after the mother was indicated for inadequate su pervision and later indicated for medical neglect. During the intact case, the mother completed therapy s ervices, parenting services, and continued to follow up on the child's medical appointments.

The mother reported she fed the infant approximately two hours earlier and burped him, then he fell back asleep. She reported he had been wheezing in the m ornings but would get better through the day. DCFS investigated the infan t's death and unfounded his mot her for death by neglect. Reason for Review: In July 2021, DCFS received a r eport that police were called t o the family home for a domestic dispute between the parents, in the presence of the infant's 2yearold and 3yearold maternal halfsiblings, while the mother was pregnant with the infant. The father left the home after the maternal uncle confronted him. Police located and arrested the father. The children were assessed as safe in the home. Police and hospital staff who treated the mother r eported she stated the father struck her in the face, arms, and stomach, but the mother denied these statem ents to the CPI.

The teen had not been diagnosed with dia betes prior to his death. The teen had last seen his primary care physician in August 2021, who reported th e teen's lab results were normal at that time. DCFS did not investigate the teen's death. Reason for Review: In November 2021, DCFS received a report that the teen disclos ed his father hit him with a water hose after he got in trouble at school for pun ching another student in the stomach. The CPI made a good faith attempt to see the child the next day. Ov er two months later, in January 2022, the CPI met with the teen at school. The teen stated the incident t ook place a long time ago and he felt safe at home. He denied his father hit him and stated he was punished w ith removal of electronics. The reporter 144 stated they did not observe any injuries on the teen who had ne ver disclosed prior abusive incidents. That day, the CPI spoke with the father, who did not speak English w ell. The father denied hitting the teen and did not recall the incident. The CPI made plans to call the fat her back because the language line was not working that day. Five days later, the CPI called the father wi th the help of the language help line and learned the teen had died. DCFS unfounded the father for cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse. Child No. 144 DOB: 07/2016 DOD: 02/2022 Natural Age at death: 5 years of death: Vascular malformation of left superior frontal gyrus with rupture into the ventricular system Reason for review: Child returned home within one year of child 's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fiveyearold was found unresponsive by his mother, who called 911. Law enforcement found the child in his bed with vomit around him. Paramedics be gan CPR upon arrival and transported the child to the hospital, where he was pronounced deceased. The fa ther had a hereditary d isorder that causes multiple abnormalities with blood vessels, and the child's pedi atrician had referred the child to a specialist for evaluation. At the time of the child's death, he was on a w aitlist to see the specialist. DCFS did not investigate the child's death. Reason for Review: The family had a placement case dating back to 2019. The child 's mother initially began services, disengaged, and reengaged with services. In Ma rch 2021, she was granted unsupervised visits. In September 2021, the children were returned to her ca re after she completed services. Six months of aftercare services were ordered for the mother. The mother agreed to move in with the child's greatgrandparents until she could obtain stable housing. The c hild's caseworker last saw him approximately three weeks before his death via video call.

The mother stated the father had not allowed he r to come into his home after they separated over two months earlier. She reported the toddler's 3 yearold sister had been with the father all week, and the twins had been with him since the day prior to th e death. DCFS investigated the toddler's death and unfounded the father for death by neglect but indicat ed the father for environmental neglect to all three children based on the condition of the home. Reason for Review: In July 2021, DCFS received reports that the then 7monthold toddler and his twin brother were very dirty, and their parents brought them to a gathering without bottles, formula, or food for them. When the CPI wen t to the home to see the childre n, the father began to yell and denied the CPI entry to the home. The mother yelled that they had plenty o f baby food, and the father brought out 145 five large containers of formula. The parents allowed the CPI t o observe the twins and the then 2yearold sister outside the home. They were clean and free of marks or i njuries. A collateral contact reported the parents did bring formula to the gathering, but it was not enou gh, so they were given Pedialyte.

She was nonverbal and immobile. A month p rior to her death she was hospitalized for six days with COVID pneumonia. DCFS did not investigate the teen's death. Reason for Review: In 2010, at 2 years old, the teen came into DCFS care. Since 2 015, the teen had resided in a residential care facility and was receiving 24hou r medical care. She was also followed by multiple medical specialists and received physical therapy, occ upational therapy, and speech therapy. Her mother was allowed supervised visitation but did not visit with the teen. Her siblings had all been adopted. At the time of her death, the teen's permanency goal was \"canno t be provided for in a home environment.\" Her placement worker made regular inperson and video visits, i ncluding a meeting four days before her death during which her medical status was discussed. Child No. 147 DOB: 01/2022 DOD: 02/2022 Natural Age at death: 3 of death: Multicystic displastic kidney due to pneumothor ax of newborn due to prematurity, birth weight 1,750-1,999 grams, with 33-34 weeks o f gestation due to respiratory failure Reason for review: Open placement case and pending child protec tion investigation at time of child's death; four indicated and four unfounded child protection inves tigations within one year of child's death Action taken: Full investigation pending Narrative: Threeweekold died in the hospital. She had been born prematu re, weighing 4 pounds, and had life-threatening medical issues, including bilateral dy splastic kidney disorder, that required her to be transferred to a children's hospital for a higher level of c are. She remained hospitalized until her death. At the time of her birth, the mother and the newborn's cord blo od tested positive for methamphetamine. DCFS opened an investigation and later indicated the mother for substance misuse by neglect. DCFS did not investigate the death for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: The newborn had two older brot hers who were youth in care and had been subjects of eight child protecti on investigations in the year p receding her death. In February 2021, DCFS opened an investigation after re ceiving a report that the newbo rn's siblings were frequently absent from school, and the reporter said the mother appeared under the inf luence of drugs when they visited the home. The mother denied recent drug use but refused to take a toxicol ogy screening without a court order. The newborn's then 9yearold brother denied the mother used dr ugs other than marijuana, and l ocal police 146 reported the mother had no history of drug use or possession ch arges. The mother declined intact family services. The investigation was ultimately unfounded. In March 2021, DCFS opened an investigation after receiving a report that the newborn's 9yearold brother was fr equently transported to school by various individuals because he did not wan t to be in his home, he had b een observed carrying a large trash bag of his belongings, he frequently asked for food, and he had poor h ygiene. DCFS received another report of bruises to the child, and that the brother was frequently unsup ervised and had missed 57 days of school, which was taken for related info rmation. The child reported he had bruises because he hit his head on a nail during a pillow fight. Four days later, DCFS opened an inv estigation after receiving a report that the 9yearold and 11yearold brothers had been seen riding their bikes after 2:00am and were rarely supervised. The CPI learned the11yearold brother was at a slu mber party the night of the reported incident, and both the family hos ting the slumber party and a f amily friend who had been caring for him as part of a childcare plan denied the brother had been riding their bicycles that night. The mother again declined services. The CPI submitted a request to the State's A ttorney asking that they file a neglect petition. DCFS unfounded both of t he March 2021 investigations. In September 2021, DCFS opened four separate investigations. First, DCFS received a report that the 9yearold brother had been attending school in dirty clothes, the 11yearo ld had displayed escalating beha viors at school, the 11-year-old had not been receiving his ADHD medication, and the family home was uninhabi table. The CPI observed that the home met minimal standards with working utilities, including a worki ng washer and clothesline. The mother reported the children often stay ed with friends throughout the week. The mother did not appear under the influence and refused a toxicology screening. She reported the 11yearold's ADHD medication was being changed to a slow-release version. The mother stated she needed help with an application for food stamps but declined intact family services. She disclosed she was thre e months pregnant. Eight days after the initiation of the first September 2021 investigation, DCFS open ed an investigation after receiving a report that the mother was using needles and methamphetamine in the ho me in front of the 9yearold, the mother's paramour had also been seen coming into the home with needles, and the brothers stayed with friends. The 9yearold disclosed he had found needles in the h ome, had seen the paramour with a needle in his arm, and had seen his mother doing something with needle s. The mother denied using drugs and declined intact services. Five days later DCFS opened a third i nvestigation after receiving a report that the brothers were often outside at night unsupervised. The next day , the fourth investigation opened after the 9yearold stated he did not feel safe at home, he had been abs ent from school because hi s mother did not wake him up, he bro ught money to school because he did not want his mother to steal it, and the home was dirty. In October 2021, the CPI sent a neglect petition to the State's Attorney, who reported he had not yet filed one. DCFS unfounded th e first September investiga tion and indicated the other three. In November 2021, DCFS opened an inv estigation after receiving a r eport that the mother was using methamphetamine, and the 9-year-reported he had been sleeping o utside because the mother sold his bed to purchase drugs. DCFS took protective custody of both boys an d placed them with a relative and indicated the investigation for inadequate superv ision and subs tantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. In January 2022, DC FS opened an investigation after the newborn tested positive for methamphetamine. The investigation remained pending at the time of the newborn's death. In March 2022, DCFS indicated the investigatio n for substance misuse by neglect and unfounded the investigation for medical neglect. The newborn's brothers remained in foster care. Child No. 148 DOB: 03/2011 DOD: 02/2022 Natural Age at death: of death: Candidal and en terobacter decompensated septic shock due to acute respiratory distress syndrome due to post transplant lymphoproliferative di sorde r Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records 147 Narrative: Tenyearold died at the hosp ital. She was medically complex a nd had received an organ transplant in 2021. In November 2021, the child had been diagno sed with COVID. DCFS did not investigate the child's deat h for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: In September 2021, DCFS receive d a report that the child said she was afraid of her father, who had hit her face and had a drinking problem, an d the parents argued in front of the children. The CPI met with the child's twin sister at school, who denied the allegations and reported she felt safe with her parents. The twin stated the mother was their primary caregiver, and both parents worked daily. The CPI met with the child and her mother at the hospital. The mother stated the child had been hospitalized due to an organ transplant she received six months earlier. The mother denied the father had an alcohol problem and reported th e child experienced psychosis . She stated the child was homeschooled due to her medical conditions. The mother agreed to complete do mestic violence and substance use assessments through a community resource. The child stated she was not afraid of her father and felt safe at home. She stated her parent s avoided arguing around her and her twin sister. The child was observed to be free of visible injuries, excluding her medical treatment si tes. The child, her twin, and her mother all reported the parents disciplined the children with removal of s creen privileges. The CPI spoke with the reporter, who reiterated concer ns about the father's drinking a nd stated the father was inappropriate with hospital staff and verbally aggr essive toward the mother but wa s unable to provide examples. The next day, the CPI met with the father at home, and he denied the all egations. He agreed to complete a substance use assessment. In October 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigati on for substantial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by abuse and by neg lect. Child No. 149 DOB: 06/2021 DOD: 02/2022 Natural Age at death: 8 months Cause of death: Sudden unexplained infant death Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Included in syste mic issue report; report to Dire ctor June 30, 2022 See Death and Serious Injury Investigation 13 Narrative: Eightmonthold was found cold and unresponsive by her babysit ter, who called 911. The infant was transported to the hospital in cardiac arrest where she was pronounced deceased. DCFS did not investigate the infant's d eath for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: In September 2021, DCFS received a report that the infant's fa ther often left guns in reach of the children, was gangaffiliated, and the mother f requently left the children unsupervised. The reporter added there was domestic violence between the parents. The CPI did not see the family until almost four months later in January 2022. The family denied the presence of guns and violence in the home. The then 3monthold infant and her 1yearold sibling we re assessed as safe. That month, DCFS unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physical in jury/environment injurious to health and welfare by abuse and by neglect and inadequate supervision. Child No. 150 DOB: 06/2020 DOD: 03/2022 Natural Age at death: 20 months Cause of death: Cardiopulmonary arrest due to complications of cerebral palsy; significant contributing conditions of COVID19 viral infection Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death; closed intact family services case, and one indicated and two unfounded child protection investigations within one year of child's death Action taken: Full investigation pending Narrative: Twentymonthold was found unresponsive at home. The toddler w as not breathing when paramedics and law enforcement responded. CPR was initiated, and the toddler was transported to the 148 hospital, where he was pronounced deceased. The toddler had bee n born premature, at fewer than 24 weeks gestation, and spent the first eight months of his life in the NICU. He had been diagnosed with several lung and heart conditions and required a feeding tube. The moth er reported the toddler had been breathing normally one hour earlier. Emerg ency responders reported the ho me was dirty, and the toddler had a bed but there was no indication he slept in it. DCFS investigated t he toddler's death and indicated the investigation for death by neglect. Reason for Review: In 2020, DCFS opened an intact family services case after the toddler was born substance exposed. In February 2021, the family's intact worker noted the mother had been inconsistent with program recommendations, and the intact case would be clos ed unsuccessfully. in March 2021, the intact case had not yet been closed when DCFS received a report that the then 8monthold medically complex toddler was ready for di scharge, and hospital staff wer e concerned the family could not provide the level of care the toddler would need because the father had not attended training sessions. Hospital staff stated the mother had rescinded all authorizations for th em to communicate with the family's intact worker. The CPI administered a toxicology screening to the moth er, who tested positive for cocaine and marijuana. One day prior to the toddler's discharge, hospital s taff reported the mother had completed training successfully and had no concerns about her ability to care for the toddler. One week later, the CPI completed a nursing referral. D CFS unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. In Apri l 2021, the intact worker again documented the mother was uncooperative with intact services. That day, DC FS received a report that the mother hit the toddler's then 16yearold sister on her head, and the 15y earold and 18yearold siblings had scratches from the mother's param our. The three siblings were t ransported to the hospital for treatment. The 16yearold reported her mother was intoxicated and hit her 15yearold brother. The mother stated she had to defend herself from her children, and the stepfather broke up the fight. The children were placed in a safety plan with a maternal cousin. One week later, the 16 yearold sister reported she wanted to go home, and the incident had been blown out of proportion. Hospit al staff reported the toddler had presented for all followup appointments, a nd they had no concerns for hi s care. The mother was in a substance use treatment program at that time and was compliant with her treat ment. DCFS unfounded the investigation for cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse . In June 2021, the family's intact family services case was closed. In February 2022, DCFS received a rep ort that the toddler had missed several appointments despite efforts to contact the mother to coordinat e care and address potential barriers. The day before the infant's death, t he CPI documented seeing the in fant and his mother in a DCFS office and noted the infant was a healthy weight. The mother acknowledged she missed some appointments but stated she chose to do online appointme nts because the hospital was ne arly two hours away. The CPI went to the home the following day and was informed the toddler was decease d. DCFS later indicated the investigation for medical neglect. Child No. 151 DOB: 09/2012 DOD: 03/2022 Natural Age at death: 9 years Cause of death: Cardiac arrest Reason for review: One unfounded and one indicated child protec tion investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Full investigation pending Narrative: Nineyearold medically complex child was brought to the hospi tal and pronounced deceased. She had been diagnosed w ith cerebral palsy, cardiac i ssues, hydrocephalus, seizure disorder, hypothyroidism, and anemia. She ha d undergone numerous surgerie s, including open heart surgery, and required a gtube, a shunt, a col ostomy bag, and a wheelchair. DCFS did not investigate the child's death for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: In May 2021, DCFS received a report that the child was not rec eiving appropriate medical care. The reporter stated the child had been brought to her neurologist after she removed her 149 gtube the day before and had not received food or liquids, res ulting in dehydration. The mother refused to admit her for fluids and tests. The neurologist allowed her to go home with the mother with instructions to return to the clinic the next day, but the mother did not do so. Staff reported that in the last 18 months the mother missed several appointments, including her yearly MR I, which was unusual. The mother told the CPI that an MRI had been scheduled, but medical staff were unable to find a vein to administer sedation for the MRI because the child had pulled out her feeding tube a nd became dehydrated. Medical staff offered to hospitalize the child overnight and conduct the MRI in the morning, but she declined because the child was upset, and she was concerned about the child cont racting COVID in the hospital. The mother was receptive to intact family services and stated the child ne eded a new medical bed, new wheelchair, leg braces, water therapy, and sign language services. In July 2021, DCFS received another report alleging medical neglect because the child had missed six scheduled appo intments. When the CPI went out the mother reported the child had b een seen that day. The CPI noted she had submitted intact family services and nursing referrals. The child 's primary care physician repor ted the child's frequency of missed appointments increased during the pandemic and noted the mother was concerned about the child contracting COVID, and the family had barriers with transportat ion. The doctor added that while attempting to coordinate care with the child's other providers, there was concern expressed about the mother's lack of follow through. The doctor stated the case met the criteria for medical neglect as defined but did not feel it was medical neglect at that time. The physi cian added the child's treatment team could work together to improve the fam ily's compliance. The child's n eurosurgeon initially stated the missed appointments constituted medical neglect, but later expressed a willingness to work with the family to improve compliance and stated it would only constitute medical neglect if the child missed her next appointment. In August 2021, DCFS indicated the mother for medi cal neglect in the first investigation. The mother later declined intact family services, as she was re ceiving other services and did not need services duplicated. In October 2021, DCFS unfounded the mother for medical neglect in the second investigation. Child No. 152 DOB: 10/2004 DOD: 03/2022 Natural Age at death: 17 years Cause of death: Anoxic brain injury due to brain death Reason for review: Child was a youth in care; two indicated chi ld protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Seventeenyearold was taken to the hospital in cardiac arrest and put on life support. He was pronounced deceased four days later. The teen was living in a transitional care center, had multiple disabilities, and had been diagnosed with scoliosis and Duchenn e muscular dystrophy, a terminal degenerative disorder. Five days before his death, the teen was taken to the children's hospital for respiratory issues, where he was intubated as a life-saving mea sure. DCFS did not investigate the teen's death. Reason for Review: In June 2021, DCFS received a report that the teen was in the hospital for stomach pain and had not recei ved any medical care for over a year. The mother, who brought him to the hospital, appeared intoxicated and later tested positive for cocaine and opiates. The teen was discharged to the mother's care. The CPI spoke to the mother, who reported she mo ved out of state. Three weeks later, while the investigation was pending, DCFS received a report that the mother was living in a homeless shelter and left the teen alone. Shelter staff reported the mother had been at the shelter for 17 days and had been written up for numerous violations of the program. The next day , DCFS took protective custody of the teen, and he was admitted to a children's hospital. During that investigation the teen tested positive for cocaine. DCFS indicated the mother in the first investigation f or medical neglect and inadequate supervision. DCFS indicated the mother in the second investigat ion for substance misuse by neglect and inadequate supervision based on the teen's positive toxicology report and sufficient evidence the mother 150 left the teen alone in the shelter. The mother was recommended to complete a substance use assessment, treatment, and individual counseling, but she did not contact t he caseworker until January 2022. DCFS had difficulty finding placement for the teen, and he remained hospitalized at the children's hospital. In February 2022, the teen was transferred to a transitional care center. His mother was approved for supervised video visitation. Child No. 153 DOB: 12/2021 DOD: 03/2022 Natural Age at death: 2 months Cause of death: Complication of extreme prematurity Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twomonthold was pronounced deceased at the hospital. She had been born premature, at 23 weeks gestation, and she remained hospitalized until her death. Her mother received prenatal care. At the time of her birth, the infant's mother tested positive f or COVID, but the infant tested negative. DCFS did not investigate her death for abuse or neglec t. Reason for Review: In May 2021, DCFS received a report that the infant's siblings were regularly left home alone, and the people who lived there were drug dealers an d involved in gang activity. The reporter added that law enforcement had r ecently been called to the home . The CPI saw the infant's 4yearold and 6yearold sisters, and her 6y earold cousin. They denied bein g left home alone. The mother reported that the day of the alleged incident, she was at home and had a heat ed disagreement with a neighbor, but police did not come to her home. The CP I checked with local police who confirmed that they had not been called out to the home on the day of the alleged incident. The childre n's maternal grandmother reported no concerns with the mother's parenting and denied the mother was involved with drug dealers. One week after the Hotline report, DCFS unfounded the investigation for inadequate supervision and substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Child No. 154 DOB: 01/2022 DOD: 03/2022 Natural Age at death: 6 death: Bronchopneumonia of the lungs; significant cont ributing conditions of prone sleeping position and cosleeping /bed sharing with an adul t Reason for review: Pending child welfare services referral at t ime of child's death; two unfounded child protection investigations within one yea rof child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sixweekold was found face down, not breathing, in a bed with her mother and a sibling. The mother reported she fed the infant, then laid on the bed wi th the infant next to her, and she found the infant was not breathing when she awoke. The father did not liv e in the home and was not present at the time of the death. DCFS investigated and unfounded the mother f or death by neglect. Reason for Review: The infant had two older maternal halfsiblings who lived with their father and had visits with the mother. In January 2021, DCFS received a re port that the infant's then 5yearold and 10yearold maternal halfsibli ngs were exposed to drugs in the ir paternal grandmother's home, the 5yearold had injuries on his arm, and the 10yearold was bei ng abused by her father. The siblings' father denied the allegations, the 5yearold did not have injuries, a nd the 10yearold denied she had been abused. DCFS unfounded the investigation for cuts, bruises, wel ts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse and substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious t o health and welfare by neglect. In July 2021, DCFS received a report that the siblings' father left the then 6yearold in the 11yearold alone at night, the 6yearold had bruises on his ribs, and the reporter heard the father was selling methamphetamine out of the home. The CPI met with the family at their home. The siblings' father and his paramour denied the allegations. The 11yearold halfsiste r denied the allegations, stated the mother 151 wanted her and her brother removed from their father's care, an d stated her mother made the reports to DCFS. The halfsister reported th ey went to their grandmother's home when their father had to go somewhere without them. The 6y earold half-brother had slight bruising, but they did not appear to be abusive, and the child said he d id not know where the bruises c ame from. The siblings' father stated he saw the bruises after the childre n returned from a visit with t heir mother, during which they went to a water park, and he believed the child received the bruises ther e. The siblings' father declined services. DCFS unfounded the investigation fo r inadequate supervision and substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. The day of the infant's birth, DCFS opened a child welfare services referral due to the mother's history w ith DCFS prior to 2021. The referral remained pending at the time of the infant's death. Child No. 155 DOB: 10/2021 DOD: 03/2022 Natural Age at death: 4 months Cause of death: Severe chronic lung disease due to extreme prem aturity Reason for review: Open intact family services case at time of child's death; two indicated child protection investigations within one yea rof child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fourmonthold died at the hosp ital. She was born premature, a t 25 weeks gestation, and had remained hospitalized in the NICU with a lung infection. DC FS did not investigate the infant's death for abuse or neglec t. Reason for Review: In May 2021, DCFS received a report that the infant's then 1y earold maternal halfsister was brought to the hospital twice within one week w hile in the care of her mother's paramour, the infant's father. At the first hospitalization, she was unre sponsive, had to be resuscitated, and remained in the hospital for a few days. Five days later, she was admitt ed with similar symptoms and possible seizures. An MRI revealed significant old and new brain trauma which were highly su spicious for abuse, and the family had not reported any previous injuries. An MRI t he year before to diagnose optic dysplasia showed no brain bleeds at that time. DCFS implemented a safety plan barring the infant's father from the family residence and from having contact with the children. The infant's 3yearold maternal halfsister denied the infant's father ever hurt her or her sister. The inf ant's father admitted he would sometimes hold the sister about a foot above the bed and drop her, and stated he was not gentle or careful when he flipped her over when she was choking, but he denied forceful actions a gainst her. Medical staff reported the actions the father described were unlikely to cause the brain t rauma, and there would need to be more force involved. In June 2021, D CFS ended the safety plan becaus e the infant's father no longer resided in the home and confirmed the mother was at work when both inciden ts occurred. In July 2021, DCFS opened an intact family services case for the mother. Recommended serv ices included parenting classes and domestic violence counseling. In September 2021, DCFS indicated the infant's father for head injuries by abuse. In November 2021, while the intact case remained open, D CFS received a report that the mother gave birth to the infant, and the infant was admitted to the NI CU. The reporter stated the mother had been seen with a black eye, and the parents had been removed from ho spital housing due to loud screaming and fights between them. The family 's intact worker reported no kno wledge of the father living in the family's home, the mother had been cooperative with services, and the fa ther had been offered services shortly before the infant was born. The mother denied any arguments wit h the father and stated she received the black eye when she hit her head on the bed rail during labor. T he father was denied access to the infant and was barred from the housing near the hospital, but the moth er was allowed to stay. The infant's 3yearold maternal halfsister reported the infant's father sp ent significant time in their home, and he sometimes stayed in the home while the mother ran errands. The mother denied she was in a relationship with the father and stated her only contact with him was advisi ng him of appointments. She stated the 3yearold did not understand tim e frames. The father reported he was homeless and sleeping in his car. In November 2021, DCFS allowed the father supervised visits wit h the infant in the hospital. In December 152 2021, DCFS indicated the father for substantial risk of physica l injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect due to credible evidence he created an envir onment likely to harm the infant. DCFS unfounded him for substantial risk of physical injury/environme nt injurious to health and welfare by abuse because he had no unsupervised access to the infant since her b irth. The family's intact case remained open when the infant died. Child No. 156 DOB: 07/2020 DOD: 03/2022 Natural Age at death: 20 months Cause of death: RSV infection due to obstructive sleep apnea du e to dilated cardiomyopathy Reason for review: Child was a youth in care; indicated child p rotection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twentymonthold medically complex child was found unresponsiv e and not breathing by his maternal grandmother, with whom he was placed.

The toddler's diagnoses included bialle lic mutation of the TTN gene , central cleft soft palate, neonatal hypotonia, micrognathia, supraventr icular tachycardia, and torticollis. DCFS did not investigate the toddle r's death for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: In March 2021, DCFS received a report that after the toddler b een admitted to the hospital for difficulty breathing, he gained more weight in two days than he had in the two months prior, so they suspected failure to thrive, and the mother was not bri nging the toddler to his medical appointments. The CPI spoke with the toddler's treating physici an, who stated the mother missed six appointments for the toddler, ha d refused medical consultation, and was not feeding the toddler properly. The mother denied the allegations. She stated the toddler gaine d weight because the hospital changed his formula. She said she missed appointments because of lack of tr ansportation and declined the medical consultations because she wanted to be present. The mother adde d she wanted the toddler discharged. The next day, DCFS took protective custody of the toddler, his 2ye arold sister, and his 3yearold brother. The children were placed with the paternal aunt. DCFS indicated the mother for failure to thrive, malnutrition, medical neglect of disabled infants, and substant ial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. In July 2021, they were placed with their maternal grandmother. In September 2021, the children contracted COVID, and the toddl er required hospitalization. He was discharged six weeks later. The mother visited him regularly bu t refused to engage in services and stated she would not cooperate until she had unsupervised visits with the children.

The child particip ated in occupational and physica l therapy services, attended school 153 remotely due to the COVID pandemic, and his caseworker complete d monthly visits. He attended medical appointments as scheduled, and the paternal grandmother worked with the child on his therapies at home. In June 2021, the paternal gra ndmother's adoption of the child was finalized.

The father began CPR, and the baby was transported by ambulance to the hos pital, where he was pronounced deceased. The baby had last been seen alive the night before an d slept in the same bed with his parents. The newborn had been born premature but had no other known medi cal complications. DCFS did not investigate the death for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: T h e n e w b o r n l i v e d w i t h h i s p a r e n t s . H e h a d t w o p a t e r n a l h a l f b rothers and a maternal halfbrother. In March 2021, DCFS received a report th at the father hit the newborn's then 6yearold paternal halfbrother with a belt and left a bruise.

The mother of the paternal half-brothers sta ted she had not been concerned in the past. The CPI met with the newborn's mother, who lived with the fathe r. She reported she had never seen the father hit the children with a belt nor had she observed marks on their bodies. The father stated he had spanked the 6yearold with a belt months earlier and had only used his hands to discipline the children since that time. He stated he be lieved the mark on the 6yearo ld's bottom came from him scooting down the stairs. In May 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigation for c uts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse. Child No. 159 DOB: 07/2004 DOD: 04/2022 Natural Age at death: 17 years Cause of death: Cerebral palsy Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Seventeenyearold was found in his bed, cold to the touch, wi th labored breathing. The mother called 911. Responding paramedics performed CPR but were unable to resuscitate him. The teen was medically complex, with diagnoses of cerebral palsy, chroni c respiratory disease, epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and developmental delays. He was confined to his bed and had a trach and gtube. DCFS did not investigate the teen 's death for abuse or neglec t. Reason for Review: In October 2021, DCFS received a report that the mother struck t h e t e e n ' s 10yearold sister on her ear. The mother denied injuring any o f her children and stated she sometimes disciplined her children with a n openhand hit to the arm, bott om, or back. The 6yearold sister reported she felt safe at home and received discipline through timeouts . The 10yearold reported her mother struck her but stated it was an acciden t, and her mother never hit her hard. The CPI noted no concerns when she observed the children. The CPI observed the teen, who had a dai ly inhome nurse. The children's pediatrician reported no concerns about their care and stated t he mother called the clinic when she had concerns. In December 2021, DCFS unfounded the mother for subst antial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by abuse. 154 Child No. 160 DOB: 08/2009 DOD: 04/2022 Natural Age at death: 12 years Cause of death: Sepsis due to cellulitis Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation at ti me of child's death; indicated child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twelveyearold was found unresponsive in her bedroom by her m other, who went to her room to administer her morning feeding and medication. The moth er called 911 and performed CPR until first responders arrived. The child was transported to the hosp ital by ambulance, where she was pronounced deceased. She had cerebral palsy, required a gtube, was quadriplegic, and received care from an inhome nurse five days per week. The child had been treated for cellulitis on her face four days before her death. Her mother reported she fed and gave the child her m edication around 10:00pm the night before and checked on her again around midnight, and the child had a s light temperature but was otherwise normal. The DCFS investigation into the teen's death remains pe nding. Reason for Review: In July 2021, DCFS received a report that the mother's paramou r kicked in the door after the mother asked him to leave. The mother denied her paramour was physically violent with anyone in the home after kicking in the door, but the children were present. At that time, the mother was pregnant with the paramour's child. DCFS closed the investigati on after the mother reported she was not in a relationship with the paramour, had not seen him since the incident, and was not in need of services. In December 2021, DCFS received a report that the paramour went to the mother's home and again kicked in the door when no one answered. He then reportedly punched th e mother and knocked over a swing in which his then 3monthold son was sitting. After the paramour left, the mother called police. Police stated the paramour would be arrested when he was located, and they pr ovided information for the mother to obtain an order of protection. Police observed no injuries to t he mother or the 3monthold. The child's 6yearold halfbrother reported he was asleep when his father kicked in the door and denied observing the incident or seeing anyone fight in the home. The 9yearold halfbrother reported he witnessed the incident and saw the paramour yell at his mother. The mother re ported that after the paramour came in, he tripped over the baby swing, retrieved a jacket, hit her, then left. The CPI observed no visible signs of abuse or neglect to the child or the 3monthold. The child's i nhome nurse denied concerns about the mother's ability to care for the child. In January 2022, police arrested the paramour for the incident, and the mother continued to report that she had not had contact wit h the paramour since the incident. She declined intact family services and reported she planned to pur sue community resources. The children denied any recent incidents with the paramour. The child's pedi atrician had no concerns about abuse or neglect. DCFS indicated the paramour for substantial risk of ph ysical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by abuse and by neglect. Six days before the death in April 2022, DCFS received a report that the paramour had been seen assaulting the mother an d hurting a child while leaving the mother's home. The 6yearold and 9yearold siblings denied the paramou r had been in the home. The mother acknowledged past incidents of dom estic violence but denied the new report. The CPI confirmed there was no recent police involvement. The child died while the inve stigation remained pending. DCFS later unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physical in jury/environment injurious to health and welfare by abuse and by neglect. 155 Child No. 161 DOB: 10/2010 DOD: 04/2022 Natural Age at death: 11 years Cause of death: Life threatening event at 5 months of age due t o severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy due to chr onic ventilator dependency Reason for review: Child was a youth in care Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Elevenyearold was found unresponsive and was transported to the hospital by ambulance, where she was pronounced deceased. The child had liv ed in a pediatric longterm care facility since she was a toddler, as she required 24hour care due to he r persistent vegetativ e state and inability to survive without medical technology. Diagnoses included cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and severe hypoxic encephalopa thy. DCFS did not investigate the child's death for abuse or neglec t. Reason for Review: At the age of 5 months, the child was brought to the hospital in full cardiac arrest, and an EEG at the hospital displayed no brain activity. DCFS to ok protective custody of the child upon her discharge from the hospital. DCFS indicated her mother for medical neglect, inadequate supervision, and substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious t o health and welfare by neglect. She was eventually transferred to the l ongterm care facility she lived in at the time of her death. Her permanency goal was \"cannot be provided for in a home environment.\" Her ca seworker completed monthly visits and had regular contact with her case manager at the facility. Child No. 162 DOB: 04/2022 DOD: 04/2022 Natural Age at death: 8 days Cause of death: Fulminant hepatic necrosis and failure due to i nterstitial pneumonia of the lungs and herpes simplex virus 2 infection Reason for review: Pending child protection investigation and p ending child welfare services referral at time of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Eightdayold was brought to the emergency room by her parents , who reported she had not been feeding that day then vomited. She became unresponsive in the emergency room and was pronounced deceased. It was reported the newborn was dirty, had a possible yeast infection, and injuries including a small laceration on the side of her head and a smal l, inflamed laceration to her anus. The mother reported a vacuum was used during childbirth, which hosp ital staff stated may have caused the injuries. At autopsy, there was no sign of blunt trauma or abus e. DCFS investigated the newborn's death and unfounded the parents for death by abuse. Reason for Review: When the mother gave birth, D CFS received a report for a child welfare services referral after hospital staff learned the father had previous D CFS involvement, though no concerns were noted. The father had an unfounded report with another mother t wo years earlier during a custody dispute. The caseworker met the parents in the hospital, who reported th ey did not want services. The afternoon of the newborn's death, the casewor ker visited the home and observ ed animal feces, trash, soiled carpets, and clutter. The caseworker called the Hotline to report the he alth and safety issues in the home, which was taken for investigation. The parents took the newborn to th e hospital that evening. The assigned CPI did not see the newborn before s he died. DCFS later indicated t he parents for environmental neglect. 156 Child No. 163 DOB: 01/2013 DOD: 04/2022 Natural Age at death: 9 years Cause of death: Neuroblastoma Reason for review: Indicated child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Nineyearold of neuroblastoma (cancer of the adrenal gla nds). DCFS did not investigate her death for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: In August 2021, DCFS received a report that police responded t o the family home after the mother's paramour re portedly yelled at the child and pressed on her neck. The paramour fled the scene before police arrived. The mother told the CPI that the p aramour grabbed the child and threw her on her bed when he became angry. The mother stated she was coop erating with police. She reported her paramour sometimes became upset but had never before become phy sical. The child corroborated the mother's statement. The child sta ted she was afraid of the para mour but felt safe with her mother. The CPI did not observe any marks or bru ises on the child. The child's 5yearold and 4yearold siblings denied witnessing the incident and denied any abuse. The CPI documente d the mother had changed the locks. The home was observed to be appropriate, and the children were assessed as safe. The CPI made multiple unsuccessful attempts to see the paramour. DCFS indicated the p aramour for substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to h ealth and welfare by abuse. Child No. 164 DOB: 04/2016 DOD: 05/2022 Natural Age at death: 6 years Cause of death: Complications o f congenital abnormalities and c hronic health conditions Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Full investigation pending Narrative: Sixyearold medically complex child became unresponsive; the child was transported to the hospital by ambulance and pr onounced deceased. The parents reported he had been congested for approximately two weeks and bega n vomiting the Friday before hi s death. The following Monday morning, they contacted his primary care physician to report hi s condition had not improved and were told to take him to the hospital and were preparing to do so when he collapsed. The child's diagnoses included GNAO1 gene mutation, a seizure disorder, gross motor delay, swa llowing dysfunction, and he relied on a gtube. DCFS did not investigat e the child's death for abuse or neglec t. Reason for Review: The child had three foster siblings, ages 12 to 18, who were i n the care of his mother. In August 2021, the court changed the permanency goals for the child's 12yearold and then 14yearold foster siblings to gua rdianship anged l for the sibling to independence. That day, DCFS re ceived a report that the fost er siblings' biological mother had a bed in the home of the child's mother, a nd the reporter was concerned about the foster siblings' biological mother having access to her children. The c hild's mother and foster si blings all denied that the biological mother stayed overnight or was allowed unsupervised visits. DCFS unfou nded the investigation for substantial risk of physical injury /environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. 157 Child No. 165 DOB: 04/2013 DOD: 05/2022 Natural Age at death: 9 years Cause of death: Hypoxic respiratory failure due to progression of malignant brain tumo r Reason for review: Child was a youth in care; pending child pro tection investigation at time of child's death; one unfounded child protec tion investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Nineyearold died at the hosp ital two days after his maternal grandparents brought him there due to respiratory distress. The child had been diagnosed with malignant neoplasm of the brain when he was 2 years old and had undergone several treatments. DCFS d id not investigate the child's death for abuse or neglec t. Reason for Review: The then 6yearold child and his then 5yearold brother came into DCFS care in 2020, during an investigation in which his mother was later indicated for burns by abuse; cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse; and substantial r isk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. They were placed with their m aternal grandparents. In February 2021, DCFS received a report that the child's then 6yearold brother disclosed his father had held a knife to him, and the father had a history of drug use. Following a form al investigation that included a victim sensitive interview, DCFS unfounded the investigation for menta l injury, sexual penetration, and substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to he alth and welfare by abuse. In March 2022, DCFS received a report that the child's then 7yearold brother had bruises on his arm, and the brother reported his father grabbed him during a visit. The CPI met wit h the brother and spoke with the maternal grandmother. She added the child 's prognosis related to his bra in cancer was poor. The children were assessed as safe because they were not in their father's care. The investigation remained pending at the time of the child's death. DCFS later unfounded the investigati on for cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse. Child No. 166 DOB: 03/2022 DOD: 05/2022 Natural Age at death: 2 months Cause of death: Sudden unexpected infant death Reason for review: One indicated and two unfounded child protec tion investigations within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Twomonthold was found unrespon by his mother, facedown, in his bassinette at 4:00am when she returned home from work. His mother began CPR a nd he vomited; she then called 911. The infant was transported to the hospital by ambulance, where he was pronounced deceased. The infant and his sister had been in the care of their father while the m other was at work, and the father left the home upon the mother's return. The father reported he fed the infant a bottle around 2:40am and placed the infant back in his crib. At the time of the death, the father h ad been ordered not to have contact with the mother due to two pending counts of domestic battery stemming f rom an incident in March 2022. However, the mother admitted she violated the no contact order because she did not have other childcare for the children while she worked. DCFS investigated and unfoun ded the father for death by abuse, and unfounded the mother for death by neglect. Reason for Review: In November 2021, DCFS received a report that the parents had a history of domestic violence in the presence of the 1yearold sister. The mother was residing at a shelter and had obtained an order of protection against the father. The next da y, the CPI met with the mother, who confirmed she was living in a shelter and had been having troub les with the father. She denied physical incidents but stated the father yelled and intimidated her, and he had pushed her in the past. She stated she was pregnant but did not wish to reunite with the father. The s ister was observed to be clean, free of injuries, and appeared comfortable with the mother. The father stated there was no current order of 158 protection, though there had been one in 2020. The father state d he watched the sister daily while the mother worked. DCFS unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. In March 2022, DCFS received a report that the infant had been born substanceexposed, and the pa rents engaged in a verbal arg ument at the hospital regarding the infant's paternity. Hospital staff stated neither security nor police we re called following the argument. Doctors reported the infant's umbilical cord tested positive for mariju ana, but the infant did not have withdrawal symptoms and had been discharged. The mother admitted to using marijuana during pregnancy. She denied using any other drugs. T he mother reported she did not r eside with the father. The CPI observed a bassinette and crib for the infant and his sister, provided a p ackandplay, and discussed safe sleep with the mother. Less than one week later, while the investigation w as pending, DCFS received a report that the parents engaged in a verbal altercation with the children p resent, and the mother called 911 for assistance. The CPI spoke with the father, who admitted to stri king his car dashboard out of frustration during an argument but denied p hysically assaulting her and den ied being in a verbal argument at the hospital. Eleven days before the infant's death, DCFS unfounded the second investigation for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and wel fare by neglect. Four days before the infant's death, DCFS indicated the father in the third investig ation for substantial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect; DCFS un founded the mother for the same allegation. Child No. 167 DOB: 01/2022 DOD: 05/2022 Natural Age at death: 4 months Cause of death: Acute pneumonia Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Fourmonthold arrived at the emergency room by ambulance in c ardiac arrest and later died. He and his twin brother had been brought to the hospital the day before for cough and congestion. The infant was discharged home with instructions to follow up i n two days if his condition worsened. Medical staff advised the parents to give ibuprofen or acetamin ophen. The infant's twin was in acute respiratory distress and was transferred to an outofstate NIC U because he was born with a cardiac issue. That evening, the parents left the infant and his 2yearold si ster with an aunt while the parents visited the twin out of state. The aunt noticed the infant's condition was getting worse, and she called the parents and then called 911. The DCFS investigation into the infant's death remains pending. Reason for Review: One week after the infant's birth, DCFS received a report that police responded to the family home for a physical altercation between the paren ts that occurred in the presence of the infant's then 1yearold sister. Police separated the parents b ut made no arrests. The CPI made a good faith attempt to see the family t he following day. The CPI spok e with the mother by phone, who reported she recently gave birth to twins, who were in the NICU. The mot her stated that the day of the incident, the father had been drinking and they began arguing, but she denied that the argument became physical. She stated the 1yearold sister had been present while they argued . Later that day, the CPI went to the home and completed a home safety checklist and observed the home was appropriate and had safe sleeping arrangements. Five days later, the CPI spoke with the father, w ho denied the argument became physical, and provided the father with a referral for a communitybased d omestic violence resource. The next day, DCFS unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physic al injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect because both parents denied their argume nt became physical. 159 Child No. 168 DOB: 04/2022 DOD: 06/2022 Natural Age at death: 6 of death: Interstitial and bronchopneumonia of the lungs; significant contributing condition of prematurity Reason for review: Open intact family services case at time of child's death; unfounded child protection investigation within one year of child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Sixweekold was found unresponsive by her mother, who called 911. The infant had been born premature around 32 weeks gestation. The autopsy report no ted the infant was wellnourished and exhibited no signs of trauma, cosleeping, overlay, or drug int oxication. DCFS investigated the infant's death and unfounded the investigation for death by neglect. Reason for Review: In October 2021, DCFS received a report that the infant's then 4monthold brother was not bathed regularly, the mother missed WIC and doctor's ap pointments, and the mother had previously had a child removed from her care. The reporter adde d the parents were no longer together, and she was concerned about how the mother could care for the b rother. The CPI met with the family at a hotel where they were staying. The mother reported they had bee n living with the infant's paternal greatgrandmother until one month earlier, when the mother and father each moved back in with their mothers for additional support. The mother reported she took th e brother to a wellness exam and vaccinations one month earlier, and she needed to reenroll in WIC services because she had moved. She stated both she and the father worked fulltime. She stated she had a 3yearold child, who resided with his father. The infant's father reported he was on probation fo r battery. The father denied any drug use and stated he no longer drank alcohol. The parents stated they wanted to obtain an apartment but needed assistance, and they were willing to engage in intact family se rvices. The infant's brother appeared clean, healthy, and the CPI noted the parents were attentive to his ne eds. The investigation was unfounded for environmental neglect. In November 2021, the intact family serv ices case opened. Throughout their intact family services case, the intact worker made regular visits and followed up with service providers. Recommended services included pa renting classes and mental heal th services for the fa ther; parents were compliant. Both parents were employed fulltime and maintained their apartment. The infant's brother continued to thrive. The intact w orker documented multiple disc ussions regarding safe sleep practices. In March 2022, the intact worker learned the mother had only atten ded one prenatal visit while pregnant with the infant, and the brother had not been seen for his 9month w ellness exam. The mother expressed being overwhelmed at the many appointme nts she had to manage. The int act worker offered assistance, and the mother agreed to keep her appointments. The parents remained en gaged in parenting classes and reported they attended counseling. In April 2022, the infant was born pr emature. In May 2022, the mother reported she and the father had separated , and she was concerned about t he father having visits because she believed the father was using drugs not prescribed to him. The parents' attendance in parenting classes became inconsistent. Two weeks before h er death, the infant was discha rged from the hospital. Two days later, the intact worker met with the family at home, discussed safe sleep , and observed the infant's feeding log was incomplete. The intact worker discussed the feeding log with th e parenting educator, who had reported she was to meet with the family a t home twice per week to ensur e the infant received adequate nutrition due to her strict feeding schedule and small size. The children 's pediatrician reported they had been seen that day, and there were no concerns. The mother reported she a nd the father decided to work on their relationship. Three days before the infant's death, the intact worker received a questionnaire from WIC that stated the infant had been seen at a WIC office and the fa mily was unable to purchase the infant's prescribed formula. The intact worker contacted the father, who reported they had an ample supply of formula. 160 Child No. 169 DOB: 09/2021 DOD: 06/2022 Natural Age at death: 8 months Cause of death: Viral pneumonia with focal bacterial pneumonia, significant contributing condition of mild viral myocarditis Reason for review: Open intact family services case at time of child's death; two unfounded child protection investigations with in one year of child's death Action taken: Full investigation pending Narrative: Eightmonthold was found unresponsive in his pack-and-play wit h a blanket wrapped around his neck. The mother called 911, and he was transported to the hospital by ambulance, then was transferred to a second hospital. CT scans s howed extensive hypoxia from la ck of oxygen, and medical staff reported he had old and new brain injuries and was having seizures. Two days later he was pronounced deceased. The mother had two roommates liv ing with her at the time of the infant's death that she reported had been in the home for a few weeks. The mother reported that a few day s before the incident, she had asked one roommate to watch the infant for approximately 45 minutes while s h e w e n t t o t h e s t o r e . T h e m o t h e r reported she found a knot on the infant's head when she returne d, and she had not left the infant alone with the roommates since then. DC FS investigated the infant's d eath and unfounded his mother for death by neglect and internal injuries by abuse, but indicated her fo r substantial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. Reason for Review: The mother had an intact family services case dating back to 2 019. The mother had developmental delays and a significant history of trauma. I n June 2021, the court ended the shortterm guardianship of the infant's th en 2yearold sister, who had be en placed with her grandparents, but the mother was advised she needed to put daycare services in place before the sister coul d be returned to her care. In September 2021, DCFS received a report the mother and infant tested positive for cannabis upon the infant's birth, and the moth er disclosed she had an open DC FS case. The mother reported she had a medical marijuana card and used marijuana to help with an eatin g disorder. She denied using other drugs. The family's intact worker and CPI made a joint visit to the ho me. They observed safe sleeping arrangements for the infant and assessed the home as safe. The intact worker told the CPI at an earlier visit drug paraphernalia was observed, and the father was advised tha t the parents could not use marijuana while caring for the children. DCFS unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physical injury/ environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect. In Octo ber 2021, DCFS received a report that the mother was engaged in selfharming behavior. The intact worker informed the CPI she had no concerns the mother would selfharm and sh e had observed the mother to b e able to care for the children properly. The intact worker reported that the mother had participated in psychological evaluations. The CPI and intact worker met with the mother and observed no recent injuri es. The mother admitted to earlier selfharm but denied any selfharm since the infant's birth. Th e mother reported the sister still lived with the maternal grandparents. The parents completed toxicology scr eens that were positive for marijuana. DCFS unfounded the investigation for substantial risk of physic al injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect due to a lack of evidence to support tha t she placed the children at risk of harm. The intact family services case remained open at the time of th e infant's death. Child No. 170 DOB: 06/2004 DOD: 06/2022 Natural Age at death: 17 years Cause of death: Complications o f haemophilus influenza pneumoni a and acute bacterial cystitis with prostatitis Reason for review: Unfounded child protection investigation wit hin one year of child's death Action taken: Full investigation pending Narrative: Seventeenyearold medically com plex child was at the home of his mother's former paramour when he had a seizure. The former paramour called 911, and the teen was transported to the hospital, where he was pronoun ced deceased. The teen's diagnose s included cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and 161 cytomegalovirus. At autopsy, the medical examiner noted his bla dder was infected. Staff in the teen's primary care office reported no prior concerns. After the death concerns arose that the teen had been having seizures that were not reported and his anti-seizure med ication had not been refilled for months. DCFS investigated the teen's death and indicated the former par amour for death by neglect and medical neglect and indicated the mother for medical neglect. Reason for Review: In October 2021, DCFS received a report that the teen had been observed with bruises. School staff told the CPI the teen, who was nonverbal and had multiple physical and cognitive disabilities, had bruising on his arm that appeared to be in va rious stages of healing as well as a wound on his leg. They reported the teen 's mother was appropriate, but s he would not pick him up if the school called her. The mother stated the bruises were from the teen bi ting himself and that he had engaged in selfharm behaviors since infancy. She acknowledged there had b een a few instances in which she did not pick him up from school and stated the school nurse called them often. The teen's four siblings, ages 4 to 12 years, all reported they felt safe at home, and they reporte d the teen bit himself; the former paramour corroborated this. The mother's f ormer paramour reported that t hough he was no longer in a relationship with the mother, he regularly cared for the children. The child ren's primary care physician reported no concerns. In December 2021, DCFS unfounded the investigation fo r cuts, bruises, welts, abrasions, and oral injuries by abuse. Child No. 171 DOB: 04/2021 DOD: 06/2022 Natural Age at death: 13 months Cause of death: Liver failure due to chronic health condition Reason for review: Open intact family services at time of child 's death; two unfounded child protection investigations within one yea rof child's death Action taken: Investigatory review of records Narrative: Oneyearold underwent a corrective surgery for biliary atresi a, a condition that results in liver failure if not treated with surgery, in February 2022. Th e surgery was unsuccessful, and the toddler remained in the hospital and was placed on a transplant list. F our months later, the toddler died. DCFS did not investigate the toddler's death for abuse or neglect. Reason for Review: In October 2021, DCFS received a report that the hospital coul d not contact the mother to inform her to bring the then 5monthold toddler to t h e e m e r g e n c y r o o m a f t e r l a b r e s u l t s indicated he required immediate medical attention. The CPI was able to contact the family who agreed to take the toddler to the hospital immediately. The CPI met with the family at the hospital, assessed the child as safe and offered services to the family which they declined. DCFS unfounded the investigation for medical neglect. In January 2022, DCFS received a report that t he toddler had not been seen by his pediatrician since October 2021 despite repeated attempts to co ntact the family, and the hospital had also been unsuccessful in contacting the family since November 2021. Four days after the Hotline report, the CPI contacted the family after several good faith attempts. The parents agreed to take the toddler to the hospital and provided an updated phone number and collateral co ntact. They stated the toddler had missed his November 2021 appointment, but no one answered the phone wh en they tried to reschedule. They added they were not able to read the toddler's discharge paperw ork, or the letter sent by the hospital because the documents were in English, and their primary langua ge is Spanish. The CPI assisted the parents with scheduling a new appointment and connected the fam ily with an interpreter who would also attend the appointment. The agency that provided the interprete r reported they were also assisting the family with housing and utilities. The hospital reported the to ddler was on the list for a liver transplant and was on a feeding tube. The hospital then provided an interp reter to train the mother how to use the toddler's feeding tube. In March 2022, DCFS opened an intact fa mily services case. DCFS unfounded the investigation for medical neglect. In February 2022, the toddle r had surgery for biliary atresia. He remained hospitalized, and the pa rents visited the toddler dail y. The intact worker made regular visits to the family home and had no con cerns about the wellbeing of the toddler's 4yearold sibling. 162 163 TWENTY -YEAR DEATH RETROSPECTIVE FISCAL YEAR 2003-16 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2003-2022 TOTAL AVERAGES CASE STATUS # % # % # % # % # % # % # % # # % Youth in Care 316 21.4% 20 18.5% 16 16.3% 22 17.9% 21 14 11.5% 11 6.4% 169 8 7.7% Child of Youth in Care 41 2.8% 1 0.9% 1 1.0% 2 1.6% 1 1.0% 0 1 47 2.1% Intact 13.6% 13.9% 8.2% 8 13 12.7% 14 23 282 12.8% Intact 4.3% 5.6% 3.1% 7 5 6 110 5.0% Placement/ Home 1.8% 0.0% 2 1 1.0% 3 2204 110 100% 164 FISCAL YEAR 03-16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Totals 03-22 Total Deaths 1480 108 98 123 102 122 171 2204 Youth in Care 316 20 16 22 21 11 26 432 Natural 168 6 5 9 7 5 9 209 Accident 41 3 4 5 4 2 3 62 Homicide 74 6 4 6 4 2 9 105 Suicide 18 3 0 0 3 1 1 26 Undetermined 15 2 3 2 3 1 4 30 Unfounded Investigation 348 33 37 47 29 45 53 592 Natural 112 8 12 8 11 21 23 195 Accident 120 13 12 16 13 8 11 193 Homicide 56 6 4 11 1 6 11 95 Suicide 14 1 0 3 1 3 3 25 Undetermined 46 5 9 9 3 7 5 84 Pending Investigation 203 22 12 19 11 20 34 321 Natural 62 7 2 4 7 7 11 100 Accident 50 8 4 7 3 6 9 87 Homicide 39 2 4 2 1 3 6 57 Suicide 5 0 0 2 0 0 1 8 Undetermined 47 5 2 4 0 4 7 69 Indicated Investigation 98 8 15 9 14 14 11 169 Natural 32 3 4 3 6 4 4 56 Accident 34 3 2 3 3 4 2 51 Homicide 14 1 4 1 2 2 4 28 Suicide 3 0 0 1 1 2 0 7 Undetermined 15 1 5 1 2 2 1 27 Child of a Youth in Care 41 1 1 2 1 0 1 47 Natural 18 1 0 2 0 0 0 21 Accident 8 0 0 0 1 0 1 10 Homicide 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 Suicide 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Undetermined 9 0 1 0 0 0 0 10 Open Intact 201 15 8 8 13 14 23 282 Natural 91 5 0 2 4 5 11 118 Accident 50 4 5 0 5 3 5 72 Homicide 26 2 1 2 2 3 4 40 Suicide 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 4 Undetermined 31 4 2 3 2 3 3 48 165 FISCAL YEAR 03-16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Totals 03-22 Closed Intact 64 6 3 7 5 6 8 99 Natural 19 2 1 5 4 2 2 35 Accident 19 1 1 2 0 2 3 28 Homicide 15 2 0 0 0 0 0 17 Suicide 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 Undetermined 11 1 1 0 1 2 2 18 Open Placement/ Split Custody 83 2 3 4 2 9 6 110 Natural 50 2 2 2 1 4 2 64 Accident 16 0 0 1 0 0 3 20 Homicide 9 0 1 1 0 1 1 13 Suicide 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 Undetermined 8 0 0 0 1 3 0 12 Adopted 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 Former Youth in Care 17 0 0 0 0 0 4 20 Closed Placement/ Return Home 27 0 0 2 1 3 3 36 Interstate Compact 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 Preventive Services 34 1 1 0 0 0 0 36 Subsidized Guardianship 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 Child of Former Youth in Care 4 0 0 1 2 0 0 7 Extended Family Support 14 0 0 0 0 0 0 14 Child Welfare Referral 25 0 2 2 3 0 2 34 * Autopsies that remain pending at time of publication are included in \"Undetermined\" manner.

In additio n, the vendor fraudulently reported compliance with the provision. The Department contracted with the for-profit consulting firm to review DCFS Youth in Care client files to determine eligibility for SSI and complete applications/ renewal applications for SSI benefits for those youth deemed el igible. The five-year, $4.8 million contract included an Illinois Department of Central Management Service's Business Enterprise Program (BEP) provision, whereby, the consulting firm was required to identif y a predetermined certified Illinois BEP subcontractor to be used for 10% of the contract ($480,000). To become an Illinois certified BEP subcontractor a company must submit an application with documentation that th e company is 51% owned and controlled by minorities, females, or persons with disabilities. The BEP prov ision of the contract was signed by both the consulting firm and the BEP certified subcontractor. The BEP pr ovision stipulated that the vendor cannot amend the BEP plan after execution of the contract unless the vendor receives prior written approval from the Department. The contract further required the consulting firm t o notify the Department of any change in subcontractor. In FY 2014, the consulting firm r eported to the Illinois BEP mo nitor a BEP expenditure of $102,398. However, financial records obtained by OIG investigators revealed that t he consulting firm's total amount reported to BEP included their use of the BEP subcontractor for other contr acts, unrelated to the Department's SSI contract. OIG investigators found that for work specifically performed fo r the Department's SSI contract, the consulting firm paid the BEP subcontractor $15,148; $87,250 less than orig inally reported to the BEP monitor. In January 2016, as a profit driven decision, the consulting fi rm changed from the original BEP subcontractor to a different subcontractor, which was not BEP certified, for a 5% savings. The firm m ade the change without prior written approval from the Department, as required by the contract. The new subcontractor was not an Illinois certified BEP business, nor did they meet the criteria to become certified. Though company emails indicate the consulting firm's legal department reviewed the co ntract for BEP compliance prior to the change, the consulting firm's legal counsel admitted to OIG investigato rs that the consulting firm erroneously interpreted the BEP provision of the contract as an \"encouraged goal.\" In August 2016, the Department re quested that the consulting fi rm report their use of subcontractors but received no response. After repeated requests, in April 2017 th e consulting firm falsely informed the Department that they did not have any subcontracts. However, OI G investigators found that the firm had been subcontracting with the non-BEP certified subcontractor for the previous 15 months. Th e consulting firm's program manager and legal counsel stated to IG investigators th at they again erred, explaining that the program manager did not consider the non- BEP certified subcontractor a \"subcontract.\" In July 2017, the Department requested an accounting of the con sulting firm's BEP compliance. OIG investigators found that the inquiry prompted a series of inter nal consulting firm emails assessing whether they COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION 168 were required to comply with BEP. In one of the emails, the pro gram manager acknowledged the consulting firm had not been using a BEP subcontractor. In an internal res ponse to this email, another employee confirmed that the contract contained the BEP obligation, quoting the BEP provision language within the email. Following the internal communications and before reporting compliance to the Department, the consulting firm attempted to cover their alleged prior misinterpretation of the contract by contracting with the initial BEP certified company and reassigning personnel to that company. However, tha t company was now under new ownership, with a new company name and was not BEP certified. OIG investig ators found the consulting firm knew that this subcontractor lacked BEP certification and again failed to inform the Department of a change in subcontractors. Following the change in subcontractors, the consulting firm fra udulently reported to the Department a $6,463 BEP expenditure in FY 17 using the initially i dentified BEP subc ontractor, despite not using that subcontractor since December 2015, 18 months earlier. The consulting firm's p rogram manager claimed to OIG investigators that the consulting firm erred wh en they reported continued use of the initial BEP certified subcontractor on the compliance form. The OIG investigation found that the new subcontractor misrepre sented to the consulting firm that their Illinois certified BEP status was pending approval, when in fact the sub contractor had been denied certification, as it was not deemed to be 51% owned and controlled by minorities, fe males, or persons with disabilities. The consulting firm's legal counsel stated to IG investigators that that they changed to the new subcontractor in good faith, believing that the subcontractor's certification wa s pending. However, despite the subcontractor's misrepresentation, a pending application does not fulfill the B EP requirement. The consulting firm continued to contract with the company for a year and half without BEP ce rtification and without approval from the Department. The consulting firm hindered th e OIG investigation by providing inaccurate and misleading documentation. The consulting firm initially falsely reported to OIG investiga tors a total BEP expenditure of $280,866. However, after elimination of billings of both non-BEP certifie d contractors, unapproved non-background checked personnel and duplicate billings, IG investigators foun d that in fact the BEP expenditure over the five- year contract period was just $64,232. In addition to the BEP expenditure findings, it was reported to IG investigators that the youth in care SSI applications were not being completed by the consulting firm in a timely manner. It was alleged that the consulting firm's management regul arly instructed staff who wer e not working on the Department's SSI contract to bill the Department's SSI billing code, potentially reducing the number of staff working on the Department contract. This action reportedly increased staff on the firm's less profitable contracts with other institutions. The OIG investigation found that over the full five-year contra ct period, the consulting firm fulfilled just 13% ($64,232) of the contract's total BEP obligation ($480,000). Th e investigation found that on two occasions the consulting firm fraudulently reported their BEP expenditure and attempted to conceal their change in subcontract by falsely reporting use of the initial BEP subcont ractor. The consulting firm has additional contracts with other Illinois state and local agencies. In Nove mber 2019, upon completion of the OIG investigation, the OIG referred this matter to the Illinois Att orney General's Special Litigation Bureau. The Attorney General's Office's investigation is pending. 1. This report should be shared with any entity in Illinois con tracting with the consulting firm including but not limited to the Illin ois Department of Aging, the Illinoi s Department of Healthcare and Family Services, the Illinois Department RECOMMENDATIONS 169 of Human Services, and the Chicago Public School System for con sideration in connection with a review of their respective contracts for compliance. The Department agrees. The r eport has been shared. 2. This report should be shared with the Illinois Department of Central Management Service's (CMS) Business Enterprise Program (BEP) for consideration in connecti on with any application submitted by the subcontractor and any future BEP Utilization Plans submitte d by the consulting firm. The Department agrees. The r eport has been shared. 3. This report should be shared with the Office of the Governor . The Department agrees. The r eport has been shared. 4. The report should be shared with all Illinois Agency Procure ment Officers. The Department agrees. The r eport has been shared. 5. This report should be shared with the Illinois Auditor Gener al. The Department agrees. The r eport has been shared. 6. The Department should not ent er into any future contracts wi th the consulting firm. The Department agrees. The Department agrees that there should be no further contracts with the vendor. DCFS does not have the authority to comply with this recommendation. To be consistent with 30 ILCS 500/50-65, the Department must follow the determ ination of the Chief Procureme nt Officer for the State of Illinois regarding future contracts with the vendor. The Department will share thi s report with the Chief Procurement Officer and recommend that they cease any fu ture contracts with the vendor. GENERAL INVESTIGATION 2 A 14yearold youth in care was alleged to have lived in an un authorized placement for almost a year with an aunt, who had a substantial history o f drug use including a conviction for involuntary manslaughter after injecting a man w ith a lethal dose of heroin, and who had lost custody of her own children. While living with the aunt, the au nt brought the youth in care to the emergency room for complications of an unt reated sexually transmitted dis ease. Hospital staff reported that the aunt appeared intoxicated and left with the youth in care prior to r eceiving treatment. In 2009, the then 3yearold youth in care first came to the at tention of the Department, as she was taken into protective custody, and her p arents were indicated for neglect. The court returned the child to her mother two yea rs later in 2011. In 2015, an intact family services case was opened after the mother was indicated for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare to the minor. A few months later, the mother , who was heavily involved in drugs, gave guardianship of the then 10yearold minor to the aunt. Over th e next two years the minor lived with the aunt as well as two other family members. In January 2018, after the aunt pleaded guilty to multiple drug charges and involuntary manslaughter for injecting a man with a lethal dose of heroin, the aunt was sentenced to six COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION 170 years' incarceration and imprisone d. The mother gave guardiansh ip of the then 12yearold minor to her 31yearold second cousin. In April 2018, the Department was gr anted custody of the youth after the second cousin was indicated for sexual pe netration and substantial ris k of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare to the minor. The now youth in care's placem ent case was assigned a private agency. Within the next three months, the youth in care lived in two foster ho mes and was psychiatrically hospitalized for suicidal ideations. From July 2018 to September 2019, the youth in care lived in th ree different specialized foster homes, and within days of being placed in the third home, the 14yearold youth in care ran away to stay with the aunt who had been paroled a few months earlier. The private agency worke r did not contact the Department's placement clearance desk at the time of the unauthorized placement. The p rivate agency worker and supervisor told OIG investigators that they knew the aunt had a felony, per the aun t's self-report, but did not know the specifics of the conviction and that because they knew the aunt would not pa ss placement clearance it was unnecessary to run the clearance. OIG investigators found that had the worker contacted placement clearance the worker would have been informed that the aunt had recently been paroled afte r a prison sentence for involuntary manslaughter, had a history of convictions for drug possession, fraud, burgla ry/theft, and probation violations. Additionally, the worker would have been informed that the aunt had been indi cated by the Department for substance misuse by neglect after giving birth to an infant who tested positive for opiates and amphetamines and lost her parental rights to her children in 2012. All of which, the worker told O IG investigators, she was unaware. OIG investigators found that while living with the aunt, the yo uth in care did not attend school or counseling and did not take her psychotropic medications. The youth in car e also had a 19yearold boyfriend from whom it is believed she contracted an STD that resulted in her being hospitalized. The youth in care frequently did not come home and the aunt provided little supervision and directio n. Additionally, there was frequent police involvement at the aunt's home. During the unauthorized placement with the aunt, the private ag ency worker made minimal in person visits to the aunt's home and in 2020 made just one visit in seven months , though the worker documented meeting with the youth in care in the commun ity and frequently texting with the youth in care. OIG i nvestigators found that the worker made little contact with the youth in care's school and did not follow up with medical providers to determine if she was keeping psychiatric or medical appointment s or taking her medication. The worker also did not contact the aunt's parole officer to check whether the aunt was compliant with toxicology screening and other services. The worker made little or no attempt to place t he youth in care in an approved foster home. A Department permanency achievement specialist offered to assist the worker in finding an appropriate foster home, but the offer was declined by the private agency supervis or. Though both the youth in care and the aunt expressed repeated concerns for the youth in care continuing to reside in the aunt's home due to behavioral problems by the youth in care, the worker on multiple occasions attempted to negotiate the youth in care staying in the placement. Though there wa s repeated discussion that the youth in care may be a candidate for residential placement the worker never facilita ted a clinical referral to d etermine if residential would be appropriate until after the 15yearold youth in care was removed from the aunt's home due to a new child protection investigation called into the Hotline. In September 2020, the Department initiated a child protection investigation after receiving a report that the then 15yearold youth in care came to the emergency room with complications of a sexually transmitted disease that was suspected to be caused by the youth in care's 19year old boyfriend. The reporter stated the aunt accompanied the minor to the hosp ital but was suspected to be u nder the influence of drugs and was nodding off. The reporter told the Hotline that the youth in care and a unt were informed that the minor had an infection that needed to be treated by a specialist at a pediatric hospit al, but the aunt took the youth in care and left the emergency room against medical advice. Due to the child protect ion investigator's intervention, the youth in care was transported to the hospital the next day and treated. The youth in care was then placed with another 171 relative. The aunt tested positive for amphetamines and methamp hetamines and was indicated for substantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and wel fare by neglect. An emergency hearing regarding the youth in care's unauthorized placement was conducted. The Assistant State's Attorney and GAL expressed concern about the length of time the youth in care had been left in the home and failure to report the a unt's history per requirements in periodic court reporting by the caseworker. The juvenile court judge ordered the youth in care's case to be removed from the agency and reassigned to the Department. 1. This report should be shared with the involved private agenc y. The agency should pursue disciplinary action in accordance with the agency personnel policy. The Department agrees. The OIG s hared the report with the priva te agency. 2. The Department should develop procedures for monitoring of u nauthorized placements. The procedures should include frequency of required home visits, co ntact with school and other service providers and GAL notification requirements. For youth in care under the age of 17, procedures should require a minimum of three visits per month. The Department agrees. A multi-disciplinary workgroup met to re view existing policy, current practice issues and barriers and make initial recommendations related to unauth orized placements. Th e workgroup submitted recommendations to the Departme nt's leadership team. In additio n, the Department and private agency partners conducted a review of youth currently in unauthorized placement s to ensure a plan is in place for those youth. The Department's next steps will include continued identificati on of needed policy changes and processes for youth in care who are in unauthorized placements. 3. Any unauthorized placements for youth in care under the age of 17 and that last more one month should be referred for a Clinical Intervention Placement Preser vation staffing. The Department agrees. A multi-disciplinary workgroup met to re view existing policy, current practice issues and barriers and make initial recommendations related to unauth orized placements. Th e workgroup submitted recommendations to the Departme nt's leadership team. In additio n, the Department and private agency partners conducted a review of youth currently in unauthorized placement s to ensure a plan is in place for those youth. The Department's next steps will include continued identificati on of needed policy changes and processes for youth in care who are in unauthorized placements. RECOMMENDATIONS 172 GENERAL INVESTIGATION 3 While conducting a separate investigation, OIG investigators id entified deficiencies in a child protection investiga tion regarding allegations that a then 23yearold adult son living in a specialized foster home sent a photograph of hi s genitals to a then 14yearold youth in care and that there was sexual contact b etween the adult son and the 14ye arold youth in care. The Department placed the then 12yearold youth in the special ized foster home in July 2018, after removing her from the home of her relative gua rdian, who the Department indicated for sexual pe netration and substantial ris k of physical injury/environment injurious to the health and welfare of the youth. The Department referred the yo uth's placement case to a private agency, and the youth's clinical staffing report stated she was experiencin g depression and PTSD symptoms attributed to the sexual abuse but had no behavioral issues. However, over th e following year, the foster parents reported the youth became increasingly difficult, stating she stayed out pas t curfew and posted inappropriate pictures of herself on social media. In June 2019, the foster mother gave n otice of removal for the then 13yearold youth due to concerns regarding her beha vior, and the youth moved to a different placement on that same day. In September 2019, the Departm ent initiated a child protection investigation after the then 14yearold youth disclosed to her caseworker tha t the 23yearold adult son from her previous foster home sent her a picture of his genitals. It was additionally reported that the youth state d there was also \"some physical contact\" regarding the adult son, but the 14yearold claimed it was consensual. T he youth declined a victim sensitive interview at the Child Advocacy Center (CAC), stating she previously partici pated in one regarding her relative guardian and did not want to go through that again. The youth also repor ted she told her caseworker in May 2019 that the adult son was touching her, but the caseworker did not beli eve her. In her OIG interview, the caseworker stated the youth had not previously reported sexual contact wit h the adult son; however, OIG investigators found prior statements from that same caseworker in which she m inimized the allegations that the youth disclosed about sexual contact w ith the adult son while she was still living in the specialized foster home. During the child protection investigation, the child protection investigator received an email from a different caseworker relaying information that another youth, who was 12 yearold at the time, had at least two respite stays at the same specialized foster home where the adult son l ived. The email noted there was suspicion of grooming behaviors towards the 12yearold, though the 12year old did not disclose any behaviors that rose to the level of abuse. In this email, the caseworker inquired i f this information could help with the current investigation and if the 12yea rold should partake in a CAC in terview. OIG investigators found that the child protection investigator never followed up on the information or responded to the caseworker. The child protection investigat or spoke with law enforcement af ter they interviewed the 23yearold adult son, who confirmed it was his genitals in the picture but claimed th e youth stole the picture from his unlocked computer. The adult son further alleged that after the youth le ft the specialized foster home, she attempted to use the picture to blackmail him for money. The police officer told the child protection investigator that he believed the adult son was telling the truth, because the offic er knew him, and he never had any prior complaints about him. The child protection investigation file contained a copy of the police report, which did not indicate that law enforcement forensically analyzed the adult son's comp uter, phone, or picture to verify his statement. The police report also contained screenshots of the text messag es between the youth and the adult son, and the child protection investigator summarized in SACWIS the messages in which the youth asked the adult son for money in exchange for deleting th e picture. The child protectio n investigator did not document the other text messages from the police report that appeared to corroborate th e youth's statement, including one in which the adult son appeared to admit to sending the youth the picture. T here was no indication that the child protection investigator nor law enforcement questioned the adult son about the discrepancies between his statement and the information in the text messag e exchange. It also appeared no one inte rviewed the youth to reconcile the COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION 173 conflicting statements or attempted to create a timeline to det ermine if the photograph came into the youth's possession while she was living at t he specialized foster home or in the three months since she left the home. Almost two months after the call to the Hotline, the child prot ection investigator contacted the reporter, who confirmed the information in the Hotline report. The reporter a dded the youth's caseworker first called the Hotline after speaking with the youth and seeing the picture an d related messages from the 23yearold son; however, the Hotline worker coded the call as information only and did not initiate an investigation. The reporter disagreed with that decision and called the Hotline th e next day, which then initiated the child protection investigation. Hotline administrators stated to OIG investigators that the caseworker's call should have been taken as an investigation and addressed the matter wi th the Hotline worker. The child protection investigator did not speak with the youth's caseworker, telling OIG investigators that she attempted to contact the caseworker but was unable to reach her. The child protectio n investigator did not document these attempts. However, the caseworker confirmed to OIG investigators that the youth showed her the picture and messages from the adult son that prompted her to call the Hotline, repor ting after the adult son sent the picture, he then messaged the youth, stating he sent the picture by accident and intended to send it to someone else. This report contradicted the adult son's statement that the youth stole the picture off his computer. The Department unfounded the adult son for sexual exploitation of the 14yearold youth and closed the investigation. In her OIG interv iew, the child protection inves tigator stated she found no corroborating evidence that the adult son sent the inappropriate picture to the youth. The child protection investigator explained the adult son denied the allegations, the foster mother reported ob serving no issues between her adult son and the youth when she lived in the foster home, and anyone in the home could access the son's unprotected computer. 1. The Department should pursue disciplinary action against the primary child protection investigator in the September 2019 investigation. The Department agrees. The child protection investigator receiv ed an 8-day suspension. 2. This report should be shared with the involved caseworker's private agency. The agency should pursue disciplinary action of caseworker in accordance with the agency 's personnel policies. The Department agrees. The OIG s hared the report with the priva te agency. GENERAL INVESTIGATION 4 A Department caseworker violated professional boundaries by dev eloping a personal relationship with a youth in care assigned to her case load. It was alleged that the caseworker regularly took the youth in care to the cas eworker's church, referred to the youth in care's baby as her granddaughter, and placed the youth in care's baby with a church friend after the baby came into the care of the Department. The subject youth in care was in foster care from 2004 to 2012 when she was adopted at the age of 10. In January 2019, the adoptive parents reporte d to police that the then 16yearold youth ran away and was missing. The police fou nd the youth three weeks later, and the Department initiated an investig ation after the adoptive parent s refused to take the youth home. The adoptive parents were later willing to bri ng the youth home, but the you th refused, stating she wanted a fresh start. RECOMMENDATIONS COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION 174 In February 2019, the Departmen t was granted temporary custody of the 16yearold youth in care under a no- fault dependency. The case remai ned with DCFS, and the youth in care was placed in a traditional foster home. The youth in care first encountered the caseworker named in the OIG complaint while the caseworker was visiting another youth in care in the foster home; at this time , the subject caseworker was not assigned to the subject youth in care's case. During the visit, the 16yearold youth in care told the caseworker that she knew the caseworker's children and asked about the caseworker's daug hter. Six weeks later, the youth in care ran away from the foster home. In May 2019, the youth in care's case was transferred to the ca seworker named in the OIG complaint. In violation of the DCFS Code of Ethics for Child Welfare Professi onals, the caseworker did not tell her supervisor that the youth in care knew her children. In July 2019, the you th in care was found at a relative's home. She tested positive for marijuana, and a medical exam confirmed she was pregnant. The youth in care was returned to the former foster home with a plan to move her to a maternit y home for pregnant women and their children. The maternity home was not licensed by the Department and rarel y served youth in care. The caseworker's supervisor informed OIG investigators that the area lacked reso urces for pregnant and parenting youth in care, and other placement resources were not available. The superviso r and caseworker could not remember if they discussed with the foster family about the youth in care remain ing in the home. The foster mother told OIG investigators that she was willing to maintain the youth in car e's placement, but the permanency team presented the youth in care's return to th e foster home as temporary. In August 2019, the then 17yearold youth was placed at the ma ternity home, transferred to the local high school, and tested negative for all drugs. Procedures dictate t hat the Department issue a monthly board payment to the foster parent or facility with which a youth in care is placed. The Department, however, did not have a contract with the unlicensed mater nity home and, as such, did n ot issue a board payment nor provide the youth in care with any financial suppor t during her nine-month stay a t the maternity home. Over the next months, the youth in care received routine prenat al care, engaged in parenting services, and missed some school. The youth in care started individual counse ling but was hesitant to engage in the sessions. The caseworker updated the youth in care's service plan to refl ect her participation in these services and identified substance use as a risk factor due to the youth in c are's previous marijuana use. The caseworker, however, did not include tasks in the service plan to address t he youth in care's marijuana use and did not refer the youth in care for a subs tance abuse assessment. In December 2019, the caseworker and her daughter were present at the hospital when the youth in care's baby was born. The caseworker failed to document her presence at the hospital in SACWIS or in the Child/Youth Incident report. The caseworker asserted to OIG investigators t hat her daughter and the youth in care became friends independent of the youth in care's case; both girls att ended the same high school. The youth in care informed OIG investigators that the caseworker was the only adu lt she knew in the area when she moved to the maternity home. Multiple maternity home staff members reported that caseworker took the youth in care and her baby to church with the caseworker's entire family. The cas eworker confirmed that she and her family would regularly take the youth in care and her baby to church, spend all day with them, and then go out for dinner for a period of four to five months. Contrary to the cas eworker's statements to OIG investigators, the caseworker's supervisor was unaware that the caseworker was tak ing the youth in care and baby to church. In January 2020, the permanency s upervisor documented the youth in care was cooperative with school, counseling, and medical appointments and the caseworker did not have concerns about the baby being in the young mother's care. The maternity home administered two toxico logy screenings to the youth in care that month, and both were negative for all drugs, including marijuan a. The therapist documented the youth in care made progress in therapy; the therapist did not indicate a need for nor recommend the youth in care cooperate with a psychiatric assessment. At the end of January 2020, the caseworker faxed documents to the maternity home on DCFS letterhead permitting the caseworker's daughter to transport the youth in care and her baby to 175 school and daycare respectively. Among the faxed documents was a consent form signed by then 17yearold youth in care, allowing maternity home staff to discuss the you th in care's case around or with the caseworker's daughter. The consent was not signed by the DCFS Guardianship A dministrator. The caseworker told OIG investigators that the youth in care refused to get up for scho ol, and it was the maternity home's idea to have the caseworker's daughter drive the youth in care; maternity ho me staff, however, did not remember how the arrangement came about. The casew orker told OIG investigators t hat her supervisor direct ed her to get a consent form to protect herself, but the supervisor said that she had n ever seen the documents. In April 2020, the Department initiated an investigation after the then 18yearold youth in care left the maternity home with her then 3m onthold baby. The reporter sta ted the youth in care went to the residence of a female friend, where there was prior drug use. The Hotline wo rker noted the youth in care had previously lived with this female friend until the youth in care was remov ed from the home due to using drugs with the woman. There was, however, no record that the youth in care was ever placed with the woman or removed from her care, but the misinformation would later be incorporated in to the youth in care's DCFS records. The caseworker told the child protection investigator that the yout h in care had mental health and substance use issues that the youth in care refused to address. The caseworke r also stated the youth in care was told that protective custody of the baby would be taken if the youth in c are left her placement, as the youth in care did not have the mental capacity to care for the baby on her own. T he Department staff asked if the youth in care had anyone for support, and the caseworker identified herself a s a positive support for the youth in care, adding her supervisor had asked the caseworker about being fictive kin for the baby. The supervisor confirmed to OIG investigators that she asked the caseworker if she considered b eing fictive kin for the baby, because at the time, the supervisor thought the youth in care would be in favor of t his. The supervisor also stated the case would have been reassigned if the caseworker served as a placement fo r the baby. The next day, the youth in care returned a call to a child prot ection investigator and provided her location. The youth in care stated she did not want the caseworker to accompa ny the child protection investigator, nor did she want the Department to take her baby. The youth in care was fou nd at a relative's home who had previously been approved as a visiting resource. The child protection inve stigator found the baby was safe and cared for, but she took protective custody of the baby because the youth i n care left the placement. The child protection investigator advised there were concerns about the youth in car e's mental health and substance use issues, and the youth in care replied she was in therapy and did not have s ubstance use issues. The child protection investigator spoke to the youth in care's therapist, who report ed the youth in care called into her session the previous week. A maternity home staff member told the child pro tection investigator that the youth in care had recently stopped participating in services, missed two counseli ng sessions, and was not meeting the baby's emotional needs. The youth in car e's parenting co ach told OIG i nvestigators that she r egularly spoke with this staff member, who did not report these same concerns. At the ti me of the OIG's investigation, the staff member no longer worked for the matern ity home and was employed in a l eadership position at CASA. The baby was brought into care and placed in a licensed foster home. The temporary custody order stated the youth in care displayed erratic behavior, did not have skills t o care for or protect the baby, and did not complete services. The youth in care's family case with the baby was ass igned to the caseworker, who continued to be the primary worker on the youth in care's dependency case for t he next four months. The supervisor told OIG investigators that at the time of the assignment, she was unawa re that Department Procedures prohibited the same worker from being assigned to both cases. Over the next fe w months, the youth in care provided updates to the caseworker about where she was living, obtaining employm ent, and continuing services with the parenting coach. The caseworker established the initial service plan for the youth in care's family case, which tasked the youth in care to meet with a psychiatrist on a regul ar basis, complete psychological and substance abuse assessments, and comply with the assessment's recommendat ions for treatment. The service plan also required the youth in care to take her prescribed medication, b ut there was no documentation that the youth in care was ever prescribed medication. The caseworker did not ref er the youth in care for a psychiatric or a 176 substance abuse assessment but told her supervisor and other st akeholders that the youth in care refused to participate in these services. The caseworker documented the yo uth in care made unsatisfactory progress on the service plan for the youth in care's dependency case. Additiona lly, the caseworker did not ask the youth in care to submit to a toxicology screening in July 2020 when the youth in care needed placement and cooperated with a Healthworks exam. The casework er placed the youth in care wit h an unlicensed fictive kin family that the caseworker set up through her c hurch. The youth in care told OI G investigators that she met the family at the caseworker's church, and she did not have a prior relationship with the family. The caseworker informed OIG investigators that she and the mo ther of the family had been cl ose friends for years, and the caseworker was trying to find a home that youth in care would not run from. In early August 2020, the youth in care completed substance abu se and mental health assessments, which determined she did not meet the criteria for substance use diso rder treatment nor psychiatric services; the referrals were completed by a private agency program working wi th the youth in care. Three weeks later, the youth in care's dependency case was transferred to a private ag ency (POS) caseworker. The POS caseworker told OIG investigators that she had concerns about the youth in care's dependency case, stating the service plan was flawed, and the DCFS caseworker should not have rated the y outh in care unsatisfactory on services she had previously completed. The POS caseworker also informed OIG investigators that during the transition meeting, the DCFS caseworker and her supervisor talked about th e youth in care's close relationship with the caseworker's daughter. In September 2020, an assistant state's attorney (ASA) contacte d the DCFS caseworker regarding the upcoming dispositional hearing for the youth in care's family case, as t he ASA did not see any evidence of the youth in care's inability to care for the baby. The DCFS caseworker resp onded that the youth in care was not mentally ready to parent the baby, as the youth in care was not cooperat ing with the Department and was manipulative with her POS caseworker and foster family. The DCFS caseworker sent her draft of the dispositional court report to the ASA, in which the DCFS caseworker wrote the youth in care was not completing her service plan, abusing marijuana and alcohol , not completing her classes, and not following the rules of the foster home. The youth in care's living arrangement in her foster home becam e strained, as the then 18yearold youth in care stayed out past curfew and consumed alcohol and marijuana. The youth in care confided to her POS caseworker that she was becomi ng increasingly uncomfortable and confused regarding the dual relationships between her, her foster family, and the DCFS caseworker. In Oct ober 2020, the POS caseworker arranged for the youth in care to move into transitional living program. The following week, the youth in care began individual therapy with a new counselor, who noted the youth in care exhibited a high level of willingness to participate in services and seemed motivated. The therapist lat er diagnosed the youth in care with adjustment disorder but did not recommend a psychiatric evaluation. At the end of October 2020, duri ng the dispositional hearing fo r the family case (assigned to DCFS), the POS caseworker reported that the parenting coach expressed no conce rns regarding the youth in care, who was doing well and appeared bonded with her baby. The POS caseworker stat ed the youth in care was earning good grades at night school, and although there had been reports of the you th in care being under the influence of substances, the substance abuse assessment did not reveal the need for trea tment. The judge set the goal for the baby to return to the mother's care by December 2020, further stating t he Department should triple the youth in care's visits with her baby and begin overnight visits the following w eek to prepare for the baby's return. After the hearing, the DCFS caseworker ga ve her supervisor a copy of the court order, and the two discussed the need to increase visitations. The caseworker told her supervisor that t he judge only alluded to overnight visitation. The supervisor informed the ASA that they w ould increase the visits , but the visits would r emain supervised due to the youth in care's lack of enga gement in services and noncompl iance with psychiatric care and mental health. The supervisor told OIG investigators that at the time, she bel ieved the DCFS caseworker's reports about the youth in care's noncompliance and assumed the Department had re cord of this. 177 The ASA informed the supervisor that her interpretation was inc orrect, and if the Department did not follow the judge's instructions, she woul d have him sign a more detail ed order. A week after the hearing, the youth in care and her POS caseworker met with the assigned DCFS supervis or to express frustration over the lack of increased visits. The supervisor advised that supervised visits would increase until the youth in care submitted to a toxicology screening, took another substance abuse assessm ent, and someone confirmed that the youth in care had never been prescribed medication. The youth in care st ated to her knowledge, she had never been prescribed medication besides prenatal vitamins. The supervisor told OIG investigators that the caseworker told her that the youth in care had been on medication for ADHD and an untreated psychiatric condition. The next day, an emergency hearing took place, and the ASA reported that the DCFS caseworker and supervisor were not complying with the judge's orders regarding the increased v isitations. The judge stated his orders needed to be followed and clarified that the youth in care did not nee d to complete another substance abuse assessment, as it was not court ordered for the youth in care to do so. Five days after the emergency hearing, the youth in care's fami ly case was reassigned to another DCFS caseworker. The DCFS supervisor remained unchanged, and the sup ervisor documented that there was no record of psychotropic medication for the youth in care, and so psychiatric care and medication had been ruled out. The supervisor also noted a test was needed to verify any marijuana and alcohol use and that results from a recent toxicology screening administered by the previous DCFS caseworker were unknown. The new DCFS caseworker referred the youth in care for a drug and alcohol to xicology screening the next day, and the youth in care tested positive for marijuana. This was the first time the youth in care was referred for a drug and alcohol screening since her family case opened six months earlier. In late January 2021, the baby's foster parents gave notice for the baby's removal, and the baby was placed with the youth in care's former fictive kin placement, who were also the DCFS caseworker's church friends. The youth in care informed OIG investigators that she identifie d the family as a placement for her baby, stating if she did not have baby placed there, the permanency superviso r mentioned sending the baby away to a long- term placement. The foster family agreed to supervise visits be tween the youth in care and baby during church services. The youth in care's now former DCFS caseworker told O IG investigators that she and her family spent time with the baby at church, adding the caseworker's daughter was attached to the baby, and the baby would refer to the caseworker as her grandmother. OIG investigators f ound photos of the baby on the DCFS caseworker's Departmen t-issued cell phone that were taken at th e church in March 2021, which was about four months after the DCFS caseworker was no longer assigned to the baby's case. In August 2021, the youth in care told the permanency staff that she did not want any contac t with her former DCFS caseworker but was afraid of the repercussions. 1. The caseworker should be disciplined, up to and including di scharge, for the following: (a.) failure to report her personal relation ship with the youth in care; (b.) falsely identifying members and/or frie nds of church as fictive kin to the youth in care; (c.) wrongly reporting to various stakeholders that the y outh in care had previously unreported mental health disorders that required psychotropic medication - including bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - without a dia gnosis of such; (d.) f ailure to provide the youth in care with necessary service referrals, such as for a p sychiatric evaluation and substance use disorder services; and (e.) encouraging and facilitating her da ughter's involvement in case-related tasks for the youth in care's dependency case. The Department agrees and has begun the disciplinary process. 2. The permanency supervisor should be counseled for her failur e to identify the conflict of interest between the youth in care and the caseworker. RECOMMENDATIONS 178 The Department agrees and has begun the disciplinary process. 3. The Department should review the 2019 family case, the youth in care's dependency case, the youth in care's 2020 family case, and April 2020 child protection invest igation to correct the following: (a.) The youth in care's noncompliance with medication and mental health services, and (b.) references to the fact that upon leaving the residential facility in April 2020, the y outh in care went to a former caregiver's home that she was removed from due to drug use with that caregi ver. The Department agrees. The case will be reviewed to correct the identified service areas. 4. The Department should develop procedures to ensure youth in care who are placed in a private institution, not contracted with the Department, receive a mont hly stipend for basic goods and necessities. The Department agrees. Youth in care will be required to be pla ced with licensed or contracted organizations. Approval for a non-contracted placement will only be authorized at the Chief Deputy level. The Department will develop procedures to address this issue. Youth placed in a private institution that is not currently contracted with the Department will receive a monthly stipend f or basic goods and necessities as part of an approved placement plan. 5. The youth in care should be referred for grief counseling to help cope with the death of her adopted father. The Department agrees. The youth in care will be referred for g rief counseling. GENERAL INVESTIGATION 5 A private agency approved a friend of the mother to supervise t he mother's visitations with her 8monthold baby. After seven weeks of thi s arrangement, the baby returned from a visitation hysterically crying and later t ested positive for methamphetamines. Both the mother and her friend were allege d to have had a history of sub stance use. The Department received a report alleging the then 19yearold mother was pregnant with the baby and using methamphe tamine while the then 23year old father used heroin. As the baby was not ye t born and the couple had no othe r children, the Department lacked jurisdiction and could take no further action. Three months later, the Depar tment initiated a child protection investigation after the mother gave birth, and the father showed signs of wit hdrawal throughout the labor and delivery process. The evening of the baby' s birth, law enforcement arres ted the father at the hospital for an outstanding warrant. The mother told the child protection investigator that she used methamphetamine for about six months prior to discovering her pregna ncy. The Department took protect ive custody and placed the infant with a maternal relative. The Department indicated the parents for sub stantial risk of physical injury/environment injurious to health and welfare by neglect, and the court award ed custody of the infant to the Department. The Department referred the family's placement case to a privat e agency, and the relativ e foster mother agreed to use her home to supervise th e mother's visitations with the baby. The foster mother subsequently told the assigned caseworker that she no longer wanted to supervise visi tation at her home and did not feel comfortable supervising visits with the father, who was to be released from prison, in her home. The foster mother also reported concerns about the mothe r's lack of attention and inte raction with the infant during visits. Due to the foster mother's concerns and in accordance with pandemic restri ctions, the caseworker arranged for virtual visits. The caseworker planned to utilize a case aide for futur e in-person visits at the office, but the agency COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION 179 experienced a case aide shortage. The caseworker's supervisor t old OIG investigators that during the pandemic, the agency's program director advised visitations could not be conducted in the office unless there were extenuating circumstances and in office visits required the pro gram director's approval. In December 2020, the caseworker referred the mother for three toxicology screenings per month, but the mother failed to comply in the first month. The father was also referred for toxicology screenings after his release from prison. The caseworker told OIG investigators that she spoke to the parents after they missed their toxicology screenings, explaining the need to participate in se rvices to have their child returned, and that she was required to report noncompliance to the court. In her Janua ry 2021 court report, the caseworker recommended for the parents to engage in parenting classes, cou nseling, and substance abuse assessments and treatment. As the placement case continued, the relative foster mother rep orted concerns about the mother to the caseworker, and the mother repor ted her relationship with the f oster mother was deteriorating. The mother requested that a friend be able to supervise the visits at the parents' home. Following the background check which the friend cleared, the caseworker conducted a home safet y checklist at the parents' residence and documented that the parents appeared to be under the influence of drugs while she was at the home. The caseworker also saw the mother's friend at the home and noted s he also appeared to be under the influence. The next day, the caseworker sent the parents for a toxicology scre ening, and the mother tested positive for amphetamines/methamphetamine and the father tested positive for opiates and amphetamines/ methamphetamine. The caseworker told OIG investigators that she had no experience working with clients with substance use issues. The caseworker also stated she told the p arents that the friend could not supervise their visits. In her OIG interview, the caseworker stated that Depart ment and private agency staff encourage visits to occur at the parents' residences when the child's permanency go al is return home, and the caseworker did not know she could move visits out of the parents' home. In separat e OIG interviews, the caseworker and supervisor reported they did not reassess the appropriateness of the visit s at the parents' home or require them to demonstrate sobriety prior t o visits with their baby. The following week, the father entered a 30-day inpatient subst ance use disorder program as referred from his criminal court case, which he later completed. The caseworker r eturned to the parents' home approximately seven weeks from when they appear ed under the influence; howeve r, this time the caseworker noted almost no concerns during the inspection. The agency approved a different relative to supervise the visitations at the parents' home, and the mother also submitted a request for anot her friend to supervise the visits, The background check indicated the friend was charged the previous year with possession of a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia, but no convictions. The private agency approved the friend to supervise the visitations. Over the following month, the mother missed her counseling sess ions and toxicology screenings and did not complete a substance abuse assessment. The father also failed t o initiate his parenting class, submit to toxicology screenings, or cooperate with his probation, resulti ng in serving 60 days in county jail. However, before he reported to jail the father was shot in the leg and s ubsequently hospitalized. The mother told the caseworker that a man attempted to rob the father and shot him. The caseworker attempte d to obtain the police records of the incident, but the request was denied because it was an ongoing criminal investigation. In her OIG interview, the supervisor confirmed the denied request for poli ce records and added the agency received a copy of the police report two months later, after the incident of th e child testing positive for methamphetamines. The supervisor stated if they had r eceived the report when they ini tially requested it, they would have learned the police suspected drug involvement during the shooting. The poli ce report also documented the mother admitted to an officer that she and the father used drugs at the home. L ocal law enforcement informed OIG investigators that law enforcement routinely wo rks with Department child prot ection investigators and provide reports and information during child protection investigations, but not wit h private agency staff, stating private agency workers were required to submit a FOIA request for police repor ts. 180 In April 2021, the mother's friend began to supervise the visit s at the parents' residence. Over the next three weeks, the caseworker and supe rvisor conducted two unannounced visits to the parents' home to observe the visits and noted no concerns. In the seven months since the pla cement case opened, this was the first time the caseworker documented observing a visit, and the caseworker tol d OIG investigators that at that time, she did not know DCFS Procedures required caseworkers to routinely obse rve visits. Less than three weeks later, the father reported to the county jail. The following week, the cas eworker went to the home and informed the mother that the court changed th e permanency goal from return h ome within 12 months to return home pending a status hearing. The caseworker explained to the mother that t his change meant she was at risk of losing her child if she did not participate in her services, and the mothe r stated she would follow through. The next week, the Department initiated a child protection inve stigation after receiving a report that the 8monthold baby tested positive for amphetamines in the emerge ncy room. At the hospital, the child protection investigator spoke to the foster mother, who stated the baby wa s hysterically crying when the baby returned from a visit with his mot her. The fost er mother tried to calm t he baby for hours and then took him to the emergency room, where the baby tested positive for the drug. Th e child protection investigator and law enforcement went to the mother's home. The mother denied knowin g the cause of the child's exposure, stating she did not have drugs in the home. However, the child protecti on investigator documented observing drug paraphernalia througho ut the home including, a bong, a pill on the floor, a baggie with Narcan, and syringes with one containing brown liquid. When asked about the parapher nalia, the mother admitted to using drugs in the home. The mother reported cleaning the home before the visi t but stated the baby may have found something. The mother tested positive for amphetamines/methamph etamines. Law enforcement arrested the mother for endangering the life and health of a child, and the Department indicted her for substance misuse by neglect. During the child protection investigation involving th e mother and father, the Department initiated a companion investigation into the friend who supervised the visi t and indicated her for inadequate supervision. Eight months later, the court terminated the mother's parental rights, and the father surrendered his rights to the child. The court changed the perm anency goal to adoption, and t he foster mother committed to adopting the baby. 1. This report should be shared with the private agency for the purpose of training staff on assessment i ssues in case management as we ll as the importance of obtaining collateral information from law enforce ment. The Department agrees. The OIG shared the report with the priva te agency. The DCFS agency performance team monitor will follow-up with the agency to review their pla n to address the practice issues outlined in the report. 2. The Department's Division of Clinical Practice's Behavioral Health Substance Use Group should use this report for the development of an informational reference g uide for staff on recognizing signs of client substance misuse. The reference guide should also include infor mation for both professionals and non- professionals in a supervisory role during parent child visitat ion. The Department agrees. The redacted report was shared with the Deputy of Clinical Practice and the Statewide Administrator of Substance Use and Recovery for review. The Dep artment will develop a reference guide with a target completion date of spring 2023. RECOMMENDATIONS 181 GENERAL INVESTIGATION 6 A daycare provider was an alleged perpetrator in a child prote ction investigation and agreed to voluntarily close her daycare pending the outcome of the investigation. However, the provider kept the daycare open creating a risk of harm to children attending the daycare and billed for payments from a childcare resource and referral (CCRR) agen cy, resulting in an over payment of more than $20,000 to the provider, which the CCRR agency is attempting to recoup. The Department initiated a child p rotection investigation into a daycare owner after receiving a report of a 1yearold child returning home from th e daycare with bruising on her face and ears, and a limp arm. A medical specia list diagnosed the child's arm to have a spiral fracture and concluded the injuries were inflicted in an abusiv e manner within three days of the initiation of the investigation. A child protection investigator interviewed the two sole workers at the daycare, the owner and her assistant, who both denied witnessing injuries on the child that day. Within six days, the daycare owner and assistant turned themselves in a nd were charged with child enda ngerment. Although the daycare owner was na med as the allege d perpetrator in the Hotline call, the call floor worker did not mark the intake form to alert the assigned child protection investigator that the report involved a licensed facility which would have prompted the child protection investi gator to notify the facility's licensing coordinator, as the child protection investigator and licensing representative must jointly plan their respective investigations and regularly exc hange investigative information . The daycare's licensing supervisor did not become aware of the child protection investigation until nine d ays after the Hotline call, when the daycare owner called the licensing supervisor, informing her of the inv estigation. The following day, the licensing supervisor initiated a licensing investigation and traveled to the daycare to complete a protective plan to limit contact between the alleged perpetrator and the child victim. B ecause the child protection investigation involved both daycare workers, the supervisor informed the daycare owner she needed to close the daycare during the child protection investigation. The licensing supervisor told O IG investigators that she carefully reviewed the protective plan with the daycare owner, explaining the daycare' s closure during the investigation and that the owner must comply with the licensing worker's weekly monitoring visits to confirm the closure. The supervisor reported the daycare owner seemed cooperative, appeared to unde rstand the explanation, accepted the protective plan, and agreed to close her da ycare that same day. However, t he daycare owner never closed her daycare instead keeping it open for four m onths during the child protec tion investigation. The daycare owner told OIG investigators that she was unaware that by signing the protecti ve plan that she was agreeing to close the daycare. Less than a week after the daycare owner signed the protective plan to close the daycare, the licensing supervisor sent a copy of the plan to the child protection investigator; h owever, the child protecti on investigator had been at the daycare earlier that same day and interviewed some of th e children on the premises. In her OIG interview, the child protection investigator disclosed she did not notice the effective date of the protective plan and did not realize the daycare should h ave been closed when she interv iewed the children. More than three months after the daycare owner signed the prote ctive plan, the licensing worker documented making her first visit to the daycare to monitor the owner's co mpliance with the plan. Upon arrival to the daycare, the licensing worker called the owner, who declined to allow the worker inside, stating her attorney told her that she did not need to close her daycare during the child protection investigation. The licensing worker told OIG investigators that she did not attempt to assess the d aycare from the outside to determine if it was open and operational, as the owner's aggression made her nervous. Ho wever, the licensing worker was concerned that the daycare owner could be still caring for children and n otified the licensing supervisor of the incident. Three weeks later, the Department indicated the daycare owner a nd her assistant for physical abuse to the 1yearold child and substantial risk of physical injury/enviro nment injurious to health and welfare by neglect to three other children in the daycare on the day of the incide nt. That same day, the child protection investigator informed the licensing supervisor of the completed investigatio n and that the daycare owner was recently seen INVESTIGATION COMPLAINT 182 caring for small children. The next day, a different licensing worker made an unannounced visit to the daycare but was not admitted inside and left a monitoring note to remin d the owner that she agr eed to comply with the protective plan. The same day as the second licensing visit, the supervisor cont acted the local CCRR agency, who confirmed that the daycare owner billed the CCRR for payments despite agr eeing to close the daycare four months earlier. The payments were from the Illinois Department of Human Service s (IDHS) through its the Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP), in which low-income families apply f or subsidized co-payments for childcare. The State's portion of the co-payments are paid to the particip ating daycare providers through CCRR agencies. The daycare owner reported to her CCRR agency that her daycare cared for 10 children for the four months she was supposed to be closed during the investigation, which total ed over $20,000 for that period. The CCRR agency told OIG investigators that they were not notified of th e daycare's closure until the licensing supervisor's call to inquire about the payments. The CCRR agenc y also stated the only mechanism for the CCRR agency to stop payments is to receive notification from th e DCFS licensing workers that a daycare has been closed, but the DCFS has not been consistent in providing this information. After receiving notification of a daycare's closure, the CCRR agency sends notices to the pr ovider and families that the CCRR agency will no longer make payments to the p rovider and assists the familie s in finding a new daycare. The following week, the licensing worker completed a third unan nounced visit to the daycare, where she was allowed access to the premises, conducted a walk -through, and s aw no evidence of a day care in operation. The licensing worker told OIG investigators that although the licen sing file contained only three documented visits, she did make weekly announced visits to daycare, calling at lea st a day ahead, and observed no children present. The licensing worker had no expl anation as to why the weekly co ntact notes were absent from the licensing file and the licensing supervisor had no knowledge of the worker mak ing weekly visits. The licensing supervisor told OIG investigators that there are limited options when providers refuse to comply with protective plans, except to call the provider and attempt to convince them to comply. The supervisor stated she knew of no quick solution to close a daycare, adding the pr ocess to revoke or suspend a license is lengthy. However, Department management told OIG investigators that when the daycare provider refused to comply with the protective plan, the licensing worker could have attem pted more visits at varying times to see if children were present, called law enforcement to obtain access to the da ycare, or sought an administrative order of closure. However, Department management stated the order of clo sure has never been used during a pending child protection investigation. Department procedures note: \"DC FS may issue an administrative order of closure when continued operation of the facility jeopardizes th e health, safety, morals, or welfare of children served by the facility.\" When the Department issues an administ rative order, it requires the immediate closure of a licensed daycare, and the Department has 10 working days t o revoke or refuse to renew the daycare's license. Licensing staff would compile information regarding th e licensing investigati on and reason immediate closure was necessary and obtain required approval from the dep uty director of licensing and the director. The Department procedures do not specify if the Department can issu e an administrative order of closure during a child protection investigation. 1. The Department should ensure CCWIS includes a mechanism for direct notification to licensing of a child protection investig ation involving a facility. The Department agrees. The recommendation will be incorporated in the new CCWIS. In the meantime, the Division of Child Protection is editing the CANTS 21 form, Notification of Child Abuse or Neglect Investigation in a Licensed Foster Home or Facility , to be used in all facility reports-licensed or unlicensed. In addition, at Child Protection Statewide Meetings for supervisors and area ad ministrators, the need for child protection to notify licensing at the onset of any facility repor t-licensed or unlicensed has been emphasized. RECOMMENDATIONS 183 2. The Department should review and clarify the use of an admin istrative order of closure during a pending child protection investigation. The Department agrees. Use of an administrative order of closur e during a pending child protection investigation was reviewed with new daycare Licensing staff in September 2022 and all existing daycare licensing staff received a refresher training on Procedures 383 , Licensing Enforcement in December 2022, which included instruction on the use of an administrative orde r of closure during a pending child protection investigation. 3 . T h e D e p a r t m e n t s h o u l d d e v e l o p p r o c e d u r e s f o r n o t i f y i n g t h e l ocal Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS) Child Care Assistance Program when a protection plan is implemented, and a daycare is temporarily voluntarily closed . The Department should also i mmediately notify IDHS Childcare Assistance Program of a change in the status of the protection plan for the daycare facility. The Department agrees. Procedures 383.45, Protective Plan, will be revised to require that Day Care Licensing staff notify the local IDHS Child Care Assistance Program when a signed receipt of a protection plan that requires a daycare's temporary voluntary closure is issued and when and if the day care is reinstated. In addition, IDHS will be informed that they may need to review childcare pa yments in the event of a temporary voluntary closure. 4. The Department should share this report for training and dis cussion purposes with the Deputy Director of the State Central Register, the Deputy Director of Daycare Licensing, and the Assistant Deputy Director of Daycare Licensing. The Department agrees. The report has been shared and discussed with the involved staff. GENERAL INVESTIGATION 7 A Department employee fraudulently claimed she was on state bus iness and used her Department employee credentials in an attempt to obtain dis counted state government official travel rates from an ou t-of-state hotel. According to hotel records, the Department employee selected th e discounted state government employee rate when she booked two rooms for three da ys through the out-of-state hotel's website. Per the hotel's policy, the state government rate did not apply to out-of-state employees not conducting official state business. Prior to the Department employee's arrival, the hotel staff informed the employee of this policy, stating to qualify for th e discounted rate, the employee would need to present a government employee ID from that state and a document authorizing travel for official government business. The hotel staff stated to OIG investigators that the Department employee agreed to fulfill these requirements, but that the employ ee attempted to c heck in to th e hotel by provid ing her Illinois Department ID and a letter on Department lette rhead that she had signed herse lf. Hotel staff informed the Department employee that she did not qualify for the state government rate. The Dep artment employee made multiple attempts to receive the discounted rate by telling different hotel staff th at she was there for official state business. The Department employee stated that prior to arriving at the ho tel, hotel staff informed her that she needed to provide proof that she was a state employee because she had mad e the reservation under the discounted state government rate. During the OIG interview, the employee told OI G investigators that she stayed at the hotel while on vacation and denied she told hotel staff that she was conducting official state business. COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION 184 The Department employee's pers istence in fraudulently claiming she was on state business to receive a reduced rate for hotel rooms violated the standards of professional con duct required of Department employees. Department employees are in a position of public trust and are prohibited from participating in dishonest behavior and from misrepresenti ng their duties and professional credentials. 1. The Department should take appropriate disciplinary action a gainst the employee for misuse of her DCFS authority and violating the principles of professional conduct. The Department agrees. The employee was issued an oral repriman d. GENERAL INVESTIGATION 8 A Department administrator interfered in a pending child prote ction investigation of a family with whom the adminis trator had a personal familial relationship. It was also alleged that the administrator was improperly provided acc ess to the child protection investigation access in SACWIS. A report was made to the Hotline regarding the safety of a 2ye arold child who was under the care of her father. The reporter stated the father fo und the mother deceased earlier that day, and the reporter believed the father was resp onsible for her death due to prior domestic incidents. The reporter also alleged the paternal family member s were receiving confidential information about the investigation from the administrator. The assigned child pr otection investigator contacted the reporter, who stated the administrator was a family friend of the father's an d was interfering with the child protection investigation. The Department reassigned the investigation to a child protection investigator outside of the administrator's jurisdiction and restricted access to the inves tigation records by reclassifying the investigation in SACWIS. The reporter who alleged the admi nistrator interfered with the investigation was unable to provide any specific reasons or information regarding the allegation to OIG investig ators, except that the administrator worked for the Department and was a family friend of the father. OIG inves tigators also interviewed the child protection investigator under the administrator's jurisdiction who was ori ginally assigned to the investigation, and she stated he was never contacted by nor spoke to the administrator about the investigation. Lastly, OIG investigators contacted the deputy coroner and police officer a ssigned to the mother's case, as well as the mother's neighbor, and they all reported having no recollection of speaking to nor being contacted by the administrator. Analysts from the DCFS Office of Information Technology Service (OITS) and Department of Information Technology (DoIT) were asked to review the administrator's acti vity in SACWIS to determine if the administrator accessed the investig ation records. The analysts found that approximately two weeks after the investigation was reassigned, the administrator's security acce ss level in SACWIS was changed so the administrator could view additiona l investigations outside of h er jurisdiction. DoIT staff found that the change was made by a child protection supervisor who was not within th e administrator's jurisdiction. However, the OIG investigators f ound the change to the administ rator's access level did not allow the administrator to access records for that particular investigati on. The supervisor most likely mistakenly changed the administrato r's access level when the supervis or attempted to have the admin istrato r review a different and RECOMMENDATIONS COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION 185 unrelated child protection investigation as per normal operatio ns. OIG investigators found that the administrator and supervisor worked in differe nt regions of the state, there was no evidence of a personal relationship between the administrator and child protection supervisor nor any motiv e for the supervisor to grant the administrator the enhanced security access in SACWIS. The ability to change access levels in SACWIS was intended to b e limited to two specific OITS/DoIT employees. However, the supervis or's ability to change the acce ss levels in SACWIS was due to a programing error that allowed Department emp loyees in a supervisory or hig her positions to change the access level. This also meant that the administrator did not need the supervisor t o change her access in SACWIS, because the administrator could have granted herself the change at her curr ent security level. If the system had worked correctly, the supervisor would never have been able to change the access levels. This programing error was corrected, and only the two speci fic OITS/DoIT employees can ch ange the access levels in SACWIS. 1. This report should be shared with the administrator's superv isor. The Department agrees. The report was shared. RECOMMENDATIONS 186 187 DEPARTMENT UPDATE ON PRIOR SYSTEMIC RECOMMENDATIONS The Office of Inspector General's systemic recommendations are designed to strengthen the child welfare system to better serve children and families. The OIG tracks an d monitors the implementation of recommendations accepted by the D epartment. The following syste mic recommendations were made in prior fiscal years and were pending when last year's OIG Annual Report was issued. The Department's current implementation status is detailed below in the followin g categories: CHILD PROTECTION COMPREHENSIVE CHILD WELFARE INFORMATION SYSTEM (CCWIS) DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INTACT FAMILY SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH PERSONNEL SERVICES CHILD PROTECTION FY 2021 The Department should amend Pr ocedures 300, Appendix B, Allegat ion of Harm #79-Medical Neglect to include the following required activity, \"If a child has special health care needs, as defined in Procedures 302, Appendix O, Referral for Nursing Consultatio n Services, the Child Protection Specialist must complete a DCFS nurse referral.\" (from OIG FY 2 021 Annual Report, Death and Serious Injury Investigation 1). FY 2022 Department Update: Allegation #79, Medical Neglect is in the process of being revised. The recommendation will be incorporat ed in the revisions to procedu res. FY 2021 The Department should incorporat e the Subsequent Oral Report Me mo into Procedures 300, Reports of Child Abuse and Neglect (from OIG FY 2021 Annual Report, Death and Serious Injury Investigation 6). FY 2022 Department Update: The Department issued Policy Transmittal 2022.07, Procedures 300 and CANTS 33 on September 9, 2022. New subsections from the SOR memo were ad ded to Procedures 300.50 that outline specific activities that need to be undertaken wit h each child protection investigation including: Section 300.50(a) titled \"Required Activities Prior to Initiati ng Contact with Subject of Report,\" which details the use of the SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment/ Analysis, Recommendation) tool, required pre-commencement activities, and the formation of an Initial In vestigative Plan; and Section 300.50(b) titled \"Offering of Voluntary Int act Family Services,\" which de tails the assessment process for Intact Family Services. The updates to Procedures 300 provide clear di rection on the use of a family's prior history 188 to inform and direct investiga tive activities. The updates to P rocedures 300 were reviewed in 9 subregional in person meetings with Child Pro tection Supervisors, Area Admi nistrators and Regional Administrators. FY 2021 Child protection investigations initiated within six months aft er the closure of the family's placement or intact family services case should require heightened review and consultation from the child protection Area Administrator (from OIG FY 2021 Annual Report, Death and Serious Injury Investigation 9). FY 2021 Department Response: The Department agrees. Child Protection and the Office of Lega l Services are currently incorporating the subsequent oral report memo int o Policy and Procedure. FY 2022 Department Update : The Department agrees that hei ghtened review must occur when making a final determination on an inves tigation that occurs w/in 6 mont hs of the closing of an intact report. In September of this year, in order to best provide investigators and supervisors with clear direction on how to use critical thinking in every s tep of investigations, the D epartment released significant updates to Procedures 300 that include required pre-commencement activitie s and complete analysis of the Situation and Background in every decision throughout the investigation. The Department believ es that building the critical thinking at the worker and supervisor level is the bes t mechanism to achieve safety in these cases. We believe the recommendation of close scrutiny is achieved at the worker/PSA level, and not by adding an additional task to Area Administrator requirements. The divi sion of child protection will continue to evaluate this approach, make it a point of emphasis between Are a Administrators and supervisors and make future adjustments to the hei ghtened review process as needed. FY 2021 In the absence of the Public Service Administrator, only the Ch ild Protection Advanced Specialist or Area Administrator should be allowed to approve a Child Endange rment Risk Assessment Protocol and/or provide a Final Supervis ory Decision (from OIG FY 2021 A nnual Report, Death and Serious Injury Investigation 6). FY 2022 Department Update: The Department has selected a new safety decision tool to repla ce the Child Endangerment Risk Assessment Protocol (CERAP) and the implement ation planning is underway. FY 2021 The Department must ensure that investigative teams have the re sources to adequately execute the requirements outlined in the Fe bruary 2020 Subsequent Oral Repo rts memo (from OIG FY 2021 Annual Report, Death and Serious Injury Investigation 7). FY 2022 Department Update: The Department issued Policy Transmittal 2022.07, Procedures 300 and CANTS 33 on September 9, 2022. New subsections were added to Procedures 300.50 that outline specific activities that need to be undertaken with each child protectio n investigation including: Section 300.50(a) titled \"Required Activities Prior to Initiating Contact with Su bject of Report\" which details the use of the SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment/Analysis, Recommendatio n) tool, required pre-commencement activities, and the formation of an Initial Investigative Plan; and Section 300.50(b) titled \"Offering of Voluntary Intact Family Services\" which details the assessment process for Intact Family Services. The updates to Procedures 300 provide clear direction on the use of a family's prior history to inform and direct investigative activities. The updates to Procedures 300 were re viewed in 9 subregional in person meetings with Child Protection Supervisor s, Area Administrators and Regi onal Administrators. 189 FY 2021 The Office of Learning and Professional Development should revi ew Foundations Training for child protection and incorporate training material on the use of a fa mily's prior history to assess risk (from OIG FY2021 Annual Report, Death and Serious Injury Investigatio n 6).

The Chief Deputy Director of Child Protection and SCR along with the Depu ty of Child Protection met with the Deputy and every trainer in the Office of Learning and Professi onal Development and provided training on this new procedure and how to train new hires on this important investigative function. FY 2021 The Department should establish pr ocedures for developing and m onitoring care plans during child protection investigations and for informing parents of their ri ghts in the event a care plan is put in place (from OIG FY 2021 Annual Re port, General Investigation 7) . FY 2022 Department Update: The Department agrees and is in the process of implementing a n ew Safety Decision Tool called the SAFE Model, that addresses this very i ssue by including a mechanism to ensure the safety of children when absent a determination of \"UNSAFE\" but there is an agreement by the family to make 'care plans' formally. FY 2021 In child protection investigat ions involving facility reports i n which biological children are involved, the Department should modify pro cedures/SACWIS to allow the Chi ld Endangerment Risk Assessment Protocol to be conduc ted on the biological/adopted c hildren (from OIG FY2021 Annual Report, General Investigation 7). FY 2022 Department Update: The Department has selected a new safety decision tool to repla ce the Child Endangerment Risk Assessment Protocol (CERAP), and the implemen tation planning is underway. FY 2020 The Department should communicate a more consistent application of \"blatant disregard\" to child protection staff (from OIG FY 2020 Annual Report, Death and Ser ious Injury Investigation 5). FY 2022 Department Update: The recommendation was addressed in a Practice Memo dated Novem ber 16, 2022, that was shared with Ch ild Protection staff, the Offi ce of Learning and Professional Development staff, Regional Administrators and Area Administrators with the direction to share at the team and worker level. Additionally, to ensure c onsistent application of \"blata nt disregard\" where there is a sleep related death, the Department has updated Procedure 300.75 requiring th e Area Administrator to send reports to the Associate Deputy Director of Child Protection for review. T his update is currently with the Office of Child and Family Policy. 190 FY 2019 The Department should consider strengthening Procedures 300.80, Child Protection Supervisor/Area Administrator Waivers , when an alleged child victim is inaccessible and ensure inves tigators are trained accordingly (from OIG F Y 2019 Annual Report, General In vestigation 13).

FY 2005 The Child Endangerment Risk Assess ment Protocol (CERAP) should be amended to require that workers note when a risk factor cannot be answered because of i nsufficient information. Under such circumstances, workers should be required to perform diligent i nquiry into relevant facts for assessment within 48 hours. The Department should develop proce dures to ensure that there is follow-up and resolution of unknown variables (from OIG FY 05 A nnual Report, Death and Serious Injury Investigation 9). FY 2022 Department Update: The Department has selected a new safety decision tool to repla ce the Child Endangerment Risk Assessment Protocol (CERAP), and the implemen tation planning is underway. COMPREHENSIVE CHILD WELFARE INFORMATION SYSTEM (CCWIS) FY 2021 When child protection investigators or caseworkers discover a v ideo posted on social media that depicts the family engaging in behavior that is dangerous to th e welfare or safety of minors within the household, the investigator o r caseworker should immediatel y make a copy of that video before the video can be removed from social media. The CCWIS committee should ensure that the Department's new data system is able to accommodate social medi a files (from OIG FY2021 Annual Report, Death and Serious Injury Investigation 9). FY 2022 Department Update: The recommendation will be incorporated in the new CCWIS. The Department will ensure the new system is able to store multimed ia files, including video, as part of the intake, investigation, case, expenditure, or persons and will i nvestigate the feasibility of recording media from various social media platforms. FY 2021 There should be an automatic electronic notification process to notify the Area Administrator where there is physical abuse to a child under 3, and the Area Admini strator must review the case prior to closure (from OIG FY2021 Annual Report, Death and Serious Injur y Investigation 3). FY 2022 Department Update: The recommendation will be incl uded as part of the functional design requirements in the new CCWIS. In the meantime, the Area Admini strators get a weekly report of the children under age 3 and are required, per procedure, to docume nt their assessment at the time of the safety decision. 191 FY 2020 DCFS should ensure that the new CCWIS has an indicator to alert SCR staff when a subject in a Hotline report has had their parental rights terminated. In the interim, this indicator should be added to the existing SACWIS system (from OIG FY 2020 Annual Report, General Investigations 2). FY 2022 Department Update: The recommendation will be incorporated in the new CCWIS. The Department will ensure there is an indicator to alert State Cen tral Register staff when a subject in a Hotline report has had their parental rights terminated. In addition, a request has been submitte d to the Department of Technology and Innovation (DOIT) to ensure SCR staff are ale rted when a subject in a Hotline report has had their parental rights terminated. FY 2020 With the development of the new CCWIS program the Department sh ould request that the program be able to track the CANTS and LEADS searches of individual use rs (from OIG FY 2020 Annual Report, General Investigations 3). FY 2022 Department Update: The recommendation will be incorporated in the new CCWIS. The Department will ensure that the new system tracks CANTs and LEA Ds searches of individual users. FY 2020 The Department should ensure that SACWIS and/or the new CCWIS h as all previous history of individuals linked to that person and accessible from clicking on the person's name (from OIG FY 2020 Annual Report, General Investigations 4). FY 2022 Department Update: The recommendation will be inc orporated in the new CCWIS. FY 2019 The SACWIS version of the Adult Substance Abuse Form should be amended so that the collateral section cannot be bypassed without a waiver.

FY 2022 Department Update: The Office of Employee Services developed a process for verific ation of an applicant's Child Welfare Empl oyee License. In addition, additi onal screening questions related to the applicant's CWEL was added to the CFS-717H, preliminary hire form for candidates. 197 FY 2021 Department procedures should be amended to provide that licensi ng complaint investigations involving DCFS workers should be conducted by personnel from a different field office (from OIG FY2021 Annual Report, General Investigation 10). FY 2022 Department Update: The recommendation was incorpor ated in changes to Procedures 43 7.40, Segregation of Duties which was issued July 5, 2022. FY 2020 DCFS should develop guidelines, training, and Rules applicable to child welfare staff considering adoption of a child from a family that the staff (DCFS or priva te agency) had professional involvement with. The guidelines should contain the following e lements: 1) ensuring the involvement of a neutral third-party adoption agency as the decision maker; 2) advising that staff should not approach former clients directly or with current workers, becau se there is too much risk of role confusion or inadvertent coercion; and 3) advising that staff s hould respect former clients' privacy and not use their contact inform ation for personal reasons (fro m OIG FY 2020 Annual Report, General Investigation 13). FY 2022 Department Update: The Divisions of Licensing, Permanency and the Office of Legal Services will convene a workgroup and will have a final policy recommend ation on or before January 31, 2023. FY 2019 The Department should create a timekeeping process with a form separate from timesheets to formalize and document temporary assignments (from OIG FY 2019 Annual Report, General Investigation 16). FY 2022 Department Update: DCFS Labor Relations and the Office of Employee Services (OES), i n conjunction with Payroll, created a form and timekeeping proces s to document temporary assignments. The form is to be completed by the requesting employee and their su pervisor and returned to Labor Relations/ OES for tracking and sign-off. O nce approved, a copy is sent to Payroll as well as the requesting employee and supervisor for their records. This new process and form wil l remain in place until the new time keeping system (ERP/Human Capital Management Project) has officially be en implemented, which is tentatively expected to occur between 2023-2024. SERVICES FY 2021 The Department must review Procedures 307, Indian Child Welfare Services, to ensure compliance with the 2016 federal rule regarding the Indian Child Welfare A ct (from OIG FY2021 Annual Report, General Investigation 5). FY 2022 Department Update: The Division of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion will work with the Division of Child and Family Policy to r eview Procedure 307 and address the recommendation in 2023. 198 FY 2020 The Department should issue a policy memo clarifying the proces s for determining foster home capacity based on Rule 402, Licensing Standards for Foster Family Homes , Appendix C and should be consistent with placement cl earance desk procedures (from OI G FY 2020 Annual Report, Death and Serious Investigation 7). FY 2022 Department Update: Rule 402-Non-Safety Standards Tr aining is now available on the Virtual Training Center (VTC) as of Augus t 15, 2022. The training cover s expanded capacity and directed staff to Rule 402 and Appendix B, and C, which provides a break-down of how to determine cap acity. In addition, the Office of Child and Family P olicy will issue an information transmittal informing staff of the available training. FY 2020 The Department should reconsider and clarify procedures for any language testing for Spanish speaking foster parents. The 2019 protocol provides that licens ing workers will be administering verbal tests to all foster parents with Spanish-speaking foster children. Unless the Department establishes a standard of fluency, this provision may result in grading disparities like those identified in employee-certification testing (from OIG FY 2020 Annual Repo rt, General Investigations 11). FY 2022 Department Update: A policy transmittal was drafted and submitted to the Office of Child and Family Policy to finalize the process for foster home licensing staff to designate a foster home as a Spanish- speaking home. FY 2019 The Department should create clear procedures for workers to ha ve when confronted with an issue pertaining to the ever-growing field of electronic access to sc hool records, particularly when the Department has custody and guardi anship of a minor. Caseworkers should have clear direction as to when it would be appropriate to request a non-custodial parent' s access be denied or restricted to school records. Further, the Department should determine whethe r caseworkers should request that the access be restricted from the school or through a court ord er. This should be developed in consultation with school districts and/or the Illinois State Bo ard of Education (from OIG FY 2019 Annual Report, General Investigations 13). FY 2022 Department Update: Representatives from the Division of Permanency, the Guardian's Office, Office of Child and Family Polic y and Office of Legal Services met on November 21, 2022 to determine whether a court order should be required to disallow biological parents access to electronic educational records. The results of this meeting will be shared with Illino is State Board of Education (ISBE) at a later date to establish Illinois' policy, practice and procedure rela ted to parental access to educational records. FY 2019 All placement supervisors and ca seworkers must be trained on Po licy Guide 2019.04 , Requirements for Reunification and After Care Services (from OIG FY 2019 Annual Report, Death and Serious Investigation 1). FY 2022 Department Update: The Child Welfare Advisory Committee has established a subcommi ttee to address an improved reunification training. 199 FY 2017 The Department should develop a policy for accessing publicly p osted social media for information relevant to investigative, intact and/or placement cases (from OIG FY 2017 Annual Report, General Investigations 4). FY 2022 Department Update: The current administration agrees with the recommendation and b elieves social media can be useful while investigating or providing cas ework. DCFS will continue to explore options for allowing investigators and caseworkers to access so cial media as part of their practice without violating Illinois Department of Innovations and Technology's p olicies. FY 2022 OIG Comment: This recommendation has been pe nding for 5 years. Given the br oad use of social media in our society this recommendation continues to be relevant and has a direct impact on how front-line staff can effectively execute their job dutie s. FY 2017 Prior to return home, caseworkers must develop a reunification plan that identifies basic necessities that must be in place before return home (food, beds, diapers, etc.); support services that must be in place before return home (homemaker, visiting nurse, counseling , early intervention, Head Start, day care, school, respite care, etc.); and community resources appr opriate and available within two miles of the family's home (WIC, food pantry, local library, etc.). T he Department must ensure that the family is securely anchored to supportive services (from OIG FY 2017 Annual Report, Death and Serious Injury Investigation 2). FY 2022 Department Update: The Child Welfare Advisory Committee has established a subcommi ttee to address an improved reunification training. 200 201 APPENDIX APPENDIX DELAY IN SEEING CHILDREN CLUSTER REPORT .............................................................. ........................

On January 24, 2022, the OIG re ceived a general complaint regar ding this family. An OIG investigator conducted a public aid and Medicaid search for the family. The OIG investigator did a SACWIS/CYCIS search and learned that the mother was an alleged perpetrator o n seven other child protection investigations, and had two other children in her care, a 13yearold and 14ye arold. On February 7, the OIG investigator called the supervisor, and provi ded information to the supervis or regarding the other children.

On December 24, 2020, DCFS closed and indicated the investigati on against the mother for allegation #60- Substantial Risk of Physical Injury/Environment Injurious to He alth and Welfare by Neglect due to her history of domestic violence a nd testing positive for marijuana . DCFS unfounded the investigation against the mother for allegation #82-Environmental Neglect. ANALYSIS During the OIG's review of complaints and child deaths from FY 20 through FY 22, the OIG identified a systemic pattern in child protection investigations where there was a significant delay in child protection investigators making initial contact with the child(ren) after a Hotline call. In this sample of child protection investigations, OIG investigators found that child protection i nvestigators and their supervisors failed to assess the safety of the alleged child victims in a timely mann er. The OIG review found that 11 of the 24 child protection investigations reviewed involved children unde r 1 year old; 20 of the 24 child protection investigations involved children 3 years and under; and 22 of t he 24 child protection investigations involved children 5 years and under. The review also found that this occ urrence was statewide and included both abuse and neglect allegations. The time frames ranged from just under a month to over 100 days before A-24 contact was made with the child(ren). In several of the investigations, it was not until the investig ation came due, a subsequent Hotline call was made, or a child died, that further attempts were made to see the family. Staff shortages, high caseloads and the COVID-19 pandemic have no doubt made the job of child protection more difficult, yet the basic f unction of promptly seeing the a lleged victims of abuse or neglect remains. For the Department to fulfill its mission to protect children w ho are reported to be abused or neglected, more must be done to ensure a timely assessment of child safety . Too often, investigations linger for months and when a child is finally seen, the assessment is superficial . The urgency has passed for both the investigator and the family. It can become a task to complete a nd check off, rather than an assessment of the child's safety and the parent's ability to care for their c hild. An investigation open for a long period of time with no activity serves neither the families nor the Depar tment. The Department has an obligation to the public and the families they serve to investigate reports o f abuse and neglect in a timely manner. Barriers such as a family moving and families not being at home can prevent contact. However, only a few child protection investigators documented completing a diligent search or using the IES system to locate the family. In addition, using schools and daycares as a resour ce to locate the family were often not utilized until later into investigations, if at all. Police were also no t called to request well-child checks in the event the investigator was unable to make contact with the family. Al l shift alerts (Cook) or on-call workers (non- Cook Counties) were rarely utilized . The Department has resourc es such as all shift alerts and on-call workers; Department administrati on must determine under what ci rcumstances these should be used when DCP is having difficulty locating the family. Supervisors routinely instructed investigators to continue maki ng attempts. A reminder to make another attempt should be accompanied by a plan and evaluation of why p revious attempts were not successful. Part of the plan should include u sing information found in prev ious investigations (i. e., names and contact information of relatives, schools, daycares, and doctors) or ca lling police who may have had contact with the family. Certainly, there exists no one remedy. Area and Reg ional Administrators may need to assist investigative teams when a ch ild has not been seen. On a macro level, administrators should be forming contacts with other agencies, such as local law enforcement, sc hool districts and community providers so they can assist in locating families. Procedurally, the importance of seeing children is evident thro ugh the extensive guidelines set forth in Procedures 300. Procedures 300.50(c), Initiation of the Investigation , requires that \"the safety of all alleged child victims must be assessed bef ore an investigation is consi dered initiated\" and tha t the child protection specialist shall take whatever steps are necessary to obtain th e current location of the alleged child victims and proceed immediately to their location. Good faith attempts must be made every 24 hours or sooner, including weekends and holidays, until the alleged child victim is seen, unless a waiver is granted by the Child Protection Supervisor. Procedures notes that, \"the fact t hat a good faith attempt was made and that the 24-hour mandate was technica lly met does not relieve the Ch ild Protection Specialist of the responsibility for continuing to attempt to establish in-person contact with the alleged child victim as soon as possible.\" The OIG recognizes that child protection investigations reviewe d by the OIG are only a small sample of the total number of child protection investigations completed a nd may not be representative of all child protection investigations However , this sample covers all regio ns, indicating it could be a statewide issue. The Department should review the current status of this issue. In addition, Department Administration must develop a plan to ensure that more efficient efforts are made t o meet with alleged child victims at the inception of the investigation. A-25 RECOMMENDATIONS 1. The Department should review the c urrent status of children tha t have not been seen in child protection investigations within a week of the Hotline call and develop a plan to ensure that the safety of the children has been immediately assessed. 2. Department Administration must develop a plan to ensure that mo re efficient efforts are made to meet with alleged child victims at the inception of the investi gation. 3. The OIG reiterates the previ ous recommendation from 2021 IG 006 9. The Department should increase the number of Emergency Services workers available for after-hours and on weekends to ensure that children are bei ng seen in a timely manner. 4. The OIG reiterates the previ ous recommendation from 2013 IG 110 9, that if child protection investigators cannot meet their obligation to assess child(ren) in a timely manner the supervisor should assure that the police are contacted for a welfare check .

To ensure the confidentiality of all persons and servi ce providers involved in the case, identifying information has been changed. All names, except those of professional references, are fictitious. File No: 2022 IG 0623 Child: Camille Ball (DOB Subject: Child Death SUMMARY OF COMPLAINT Fourmonthold Camille Ball was discovered by her mother, Maria Ball, unresponsive and wedged in between an adult sized mattress and the wall. Camille had been placed in the adult sized bed by her mother the night before and Ms. Ball de nied hearing Camille during the night. Ms. Ball calle d 911 and a neighbor attempted CPR prior to first responders arriving. Camille was t a k e n t o t h e h o s p i t a l , w h e r e s h e w a s pronounced deceased. Ms. Ball has an extensive history of child neglect in another state, including an open placement case involving her two older children due to ongoing concerns for Ms. Ball's mental health and substance abuse. Maria Ball fled to Illinois to give birth to C amille presumably to avoid Child Protective Services from taking custody. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) investigated the deat h pursuant to its directive to investigate the deaths of Illinois children whose families have been involved w ith the Department of C hildren and Family Services (DCFS) within the preceding 12 months. There was an op en Intact Family Services Case and a pending child protection investigation at the time of Camille's death, as well as two unfounded child protection investigations within the year. INVESTIGATION Background Camille Ball was born in May 2021, to Maria Ball (DOB 07/1996) and Nate Levin (DOB and H enrik Knowles (DOB 05/2019), who were removed from her custody in 2019 by another state's child protective services agency and remained in their placements in that state . Ms. Ball had an extensive hi story with the other state's child protective services agency dating back to 2016 due to ongoing concerns reg arding her mental health, substance use, medical neglect, and inadequate supervision. Ms. Ball had an op en case in the other state to receive supportive services in order for the family to remain intact bu t signed an affidavit which stated that she was \"temporarily unable to provide for her children.\" The case was taken to juvenile court and in September 2019, Jasiah and Henrik were placed into foster care. Ms. Ball was not compliant with services and continued to use drugs. B-2 SCR #2222222A June 3, 2021 - July 2, 2021 Allegation #60- Substantial Risk of Physical Injury/ Environment Injurious to Health and Welfare by Neglect to Camille Ball by Maria Ball- Unfounded On June 3, 2021, a worker with child protective services from t he other state called the Illinois Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline to report the following: Ms. Ball has an open case with CPS in another state where her t wo older children have been placed in foster care. Ms. Ball tested positive for cocaine on a hair follicle test in July 2020 and was positive for marijuana in January 2021. Ms. Ball has been n on-cooperative with her services, and she was informed tha t this baby would need to be seen and assessed by someone from CPS. Ms. Ball has fled to Illinois and has refused to give CPS in the other state any access to the baby. There are serious concerns for her mental health a nd drug use and how it pertains to the safety and risk to the baby. The Department opened an investig ation for substantial risk to Camille by her mother, Ms. Ball. The investigation was assigned to Child Protection Investigator (CP I) Coral Majors, 1 s u p e r v i s e d b y P u b l i c Service Administrator (PSA) Yolanda Barnes.2 CPI Majors spoke with the reporter who stated that Ms. Ball has a pending child protection investigation in another st ate, and the reporter was the assigned investigator. The other state's child protective services worke r explained that Ms. Ball had a history of substance abuse and mental health concerns; she had not been co mpliant with the placement worker or services, and the case was moving towards termination of Ms. Ba ll's parental rights. Ms. Ball reportedly did not know who Camille's father was. Ms. Ball had reportedly been homeless, and it was believed she was staying in a domestic violence shelter in Illinois. CPI Maj ors then spoke with the placement case worker from the other state, caseworker Ruby Moss. Caseworker Moss rep orted that Ms. Ball's case came to the attention of the state's family services agency due to medical neglect of Ms. Ball's son, and they discovered that Ms. Ball had a history of unaddressed mental health and su bstance use issues. Caseworker Moss reported that Ms. Ball had requested that the children be taken into custody due to Ms. Ball being unable to care for the children.3 Ms. Ball had not been compliant with toxicology screenings or in person visitation with the children. Ms. Ball co mpleted a psychological evaluatio n and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, hypomania, and chemical misuse. M s. Ball had been recommended t o follow through with mental health treatment and medication although failed to do so. Ms. Ball had not completed recommended substance abuse evaluation or parenting services and had failed to mainta in adequate housing and employment. Caseworker Moss reported that Camille would have been taken int o custody if Ms. Ball had delivered in the other state and noted that Ms. Ball had stated that \"they w ill have to kill her (Ms. Ball) first to get the baby (Camille).\" Ms. Ball was on probation, which Caseworker Mo ss believed was another reason that Ms. Ball fled, as she did not want to deliver the baby while in jai l. Caseworker Moss believed Ms. Ball may be staying with her father, Samson Ball, and provided Mr. Ball's a ddress in Pavlov, IL. On June 4, CPI Majors went to the home of Ms. Ball's father, Sa mson Ball. Mr. Ball reported that Ms. Ball and Camille were at a shelter. Mr. Ball reported that he was wi lling to help Ms. Ball as much as possible to get her back on her feet and that Ms. Ball came from the other state in April. 1 CPI Majors started with the Department in January 2019, and pr eviously worked as a placement and Intact CWS with a private agency for three years. 2 PSA Barnes has been working in child welfare for 22 years and started with the Department in 2008. 3 Child welfare documents from the other state indicated that Ma ria had signed an affidavit which stated that she was \"temporarily unable to provide for her children.\" The case was taken to court and the children were placed in care in September 2019. CPI Majors told OIG investigators that she requ ested the other state's child welfare documents, but they were not received prior to t he investigation closing. CPI O'Neal requested the records again while the B- and C- sequence investigations were pending, but they were not receive d until September 2021. The other state's records were in the DCP investigation a ttachments and OIG investigators reviewed the other state' s child welfare records. B-3 CPI Majors then traveled to Delta Refuge to meet with Ms. Ball and Camille. CPI Majors reported that she spoke briefly to Delta Refuge st aff who reported that Ms. Ball had been at the shelte r for about two weeks and had been cooperating with the program thus far. CPI Majors then spoke to Ms. Ball, who reported that she was working with Delta Ref uge's program to obtain transitio nal and stable housing. Ms. Ball reported to CPI Majors that she came to Illinois as there were no resour ces to help her in the other state. Ms. Ball reported that her older two children were in foster care, and s he had been unable to complete recommended services due to lack of transportation. CPI Majors told OIG inv estigators that the other state's placement worker did not report that transportation was a barrier to Ms. Ball engaging in services. Ms. Ball told CPI Majors that the only service required for the children to be re turned to her care was for her to obtain appropriate housing. Ms. Ball re ported that she completed a psy chological evaluation but denied that she was diagnosed with any mental health conditions. She reported t hat she did not know that mental health treatment and medication had been recommended. Ms. Ball denied use of cocaine and reported that the only way she could have tested positive for cocaine was if the marijuana she smoked was laced unbeknownst to her. Ms. Ball repor ted previous domestic violenc e with her older children's father and reported that she did not know w ho Camille's father was but bel ieved that people called him \"Nate.\" Ms. Ball reported that she was on probation in another state for as sault against a family member, but her probation officer did not know she was in Illinois. CPI Majors directed Ms. Ball to notify her probation officer of her move to Illinois. CPI Majors reported to OIG inv estigators that she did not request contact information for Ms. Ball's probation officer and CPI Majors did not speak with the probation officer during the investigation. CPI Majors did not speak to Ms. Ball about t he possible consequences of Ms. Ball leaving the state while on probation and CPI Majors did not request an out of state LEADS. CPI Majors explained Intact Family Services and Ms. Ball agreed to services. CPI Maj ors gave full disclosure that should Ms. Ball not cooperate with services, her baby may come into care. While at the shelter, CPI Majors observed Camille and noted no visible signs of abuse or neglect. Camille was assessed safe. That day, CPI Majors completed a CERAP and d etermined Camille was safe. The safety decision stated, CPI met with mother and child at Delta Refuge in Pavlov. Mother m o v e d i n P a v l o v approximately one month ago and has been at the shelter for app roximately 2 weeks. Mother moved to Pavlov to get back on her feet and has support in Pavlov. Mother does have an open placement case in another state but failed to get the support from her placement worker to get back on her feet. Mother has a service plan at Delta Refuge and is working on getting into the transitional living program, Epsilo n CPI offered an intact family service case and mother accepted. No safety concerns at this time. CERAP is safe. CPI Majors reported to OIG investigators that protective custod y was ruled out because Ms. Ball was participating in services at Delta Refuge, had a service plan, Camille was not born s ubstance exposed, and Ms. Ball agreed to Intact Family Services. PSA Barnes reported to OIG investigators that protective custody or implementation of a safety plan was ruled out because \"mom h ad gotten herself signed up for WIC, she was getting assistance, she had gotten herself into Delta Refug e, baby appeared healthy, people at Delta Refuge said mom appeared to be doing great with the baby, she a greed to Intact services, she was cooperating, she said that she wanted assistance. We really did n't see anything at that point to suggest the baby was unsafe.\" PSA Barnes went on to report the decision to open an Intact case was \"made very quickly\" as the public service administrator and child protecti o n i n v e s t i g a t o r d i d n o t f e e l t h e r e w a s \"immediate and urgent\" need to take protective custody, but tha t Ms. Ball needed services and needed to be linked up with services in Illinois. PSA Barnes reported to OIG investigators that if they took protective custody at that time, the case would not \"get through court,\" b ut acknowledged that more information should have been obtained prior to closing the investigation. B-4 On June 8, CPI Majors sent a request to Pavlov Police Departmen t for all records on Ms. Ball and was informed that no records existed . A handoff was completed with DCFS for Intact Family Services on June 11, and the transitional visit took place on June 15. CPI Major s confirmed with Camille's pediatrician that she was up to date with well child exams. On June 25, PSA Barnes entered a final supervisory note stating : The allegation was made that Maria Ball neglected her infant da ughter due to a history of drug abuse and domestic violence in the other state. CPS staff in an other state have an open placement case due to Maria's older children being in foster ca re. They planned to take protective custody of this baby when they learned that Maria fl ed from the other state to be with her family in Illinois. Maria had the baby two weeks prior to the receipt of this report and was living in a shelter. CPI met with her, and Maria reported t hat she left the other state because she needed to get away from pe ople who were bad influences and needed to be closer to family who could be supportive. She is getting counseling at the shelt er and was willing to have an Intact Case in Pavlov to address ongoing issues. Baby Camille a nd Maria did not test positive for any substances at the time of birth. CPI spoke with profess ionals and relatives with knowledge of Maria. CPI did not gather information to support t hat Maria had created a risk of harm to her newborn at this time. Despite her history with prio r children, this child was assessed as safe, and an Intact Case was opened to provide oversight and support. CPI recommends that the allegation #60 be unfounded . PSA agreed with CPI's recommen ded finding. The investigation was unfounded and closed on July 2, 2021. PSA Barnes reported to OIG investigators that if Ms. Ball's placement case had been in Illinois, the dec ision to unfound the allegation would likely have been different as the child protection investigator and pu blic service administrator would have had immediate and direct access to Ms. Ball's history with the Depa rtment. Intact Family Services Case June 15, 2021 - March 15, 2022 4 The case was assigned to child welfare specialist (CWS) Marcus Holmes5, supervised by PSA Leslie Booker6 with DCFS for Intact Family Services.

CPI Marley report ed to OIG investigators that she did not ask Ms. Ball where Camille had been s leeping prior to the pack and play being assembled.

B-8 staffing occurred with PSA Long where Camille was assessed as S afe.14 PSA Long noted that Camille had been \"screaming and was clearly hungry and immediately took a b ottle\" upon CPI Marley's arrival. The Intact supervisor, PSA Booker, documented a conversation wi th CWS Holmes, who reported that following the visit with Ms. Ball and Camille, CWS Holmes dropp ed his car off at the mechanic. CWS Holmes reported that on-call CPI Sherry Marley contacted CWS Ho lmes and \"demanded\" that CWS Holmes or PSA Booker meet her at her office. PSA Booker then sp oke with CPI Marley who reported that \"it was her opinion that the re port should not have been made. CPI stated that it was her opinion that it was called in so that an investigator would take formula to the hom e rather than the intact worker having to take it.\" PSA Booker documented that CPI Marley went on to state tha t \"this is a parenting issue\" and recommended service providers for Ms. Ball to be referred.15 PSA Booker attempted to explain to CPI Marley that there were larger concerns for Ms. Ball's ability t o appropriately provi de for Camille rather than Ms. Ball simply running out of formula. PSA Booker reporte d to OIG investigators that Ms. Ball's failure to utilize CWS Holmes as a resource and the choice to n ot be forthcoming about a need for her baby in order to prevent her from \"getting in trouble\" was concernin g for Ms. Ball's ability to provide appropriate care for Camille. PSA Booker offered to assist CPI Marley with getting Camille formula which CPI Marley declined. On July 27, PSA Booker noted that CWS Holmes received a message from Ms. Ball over the weekend stating that she needed assistance as she was unable to pay for the hotel where she and Camille were staying. CWS Holmes attempted to call both Ms. Ball and Mr. Ball to dete rmine Camille's whereabouts but there was no answer.

According to Blue Sky Shelter staff, Cami lle was having problems taking a bottle while in their childcare. Ms. Ball reported that Camille was ju st upset to be in someone else's care and was \"fine\" after returning to Ms. B all's care. It was noted that Ms . Ball was not doing wha t she had been asked to do, such as working with agencies to obtain her ID and birth certificate. PSA Beckman noted that although the tasks are menial, they are important because they are required to obtain housing, employment, or benefits. It was noted that Ms. Ball was providing the bare minimum of support to Camille and did not appear to take caring for the child seriously. PSA Beckman note d that on August 4, Ms. Ball was kicked out of the shelter where she and Camille were staying because M s. Ball refused to follow the rules and went on a walk. Ms. Ball reported to CPI O'Neal that she had taken C amille on the walk with her and returned to Delta Refuge after being kicke d out of BlueSky Shelter demon strating a disregard for responsibility for Camille's needs. PSA Beckman dir ected CPI O'Neal and CWS Holmes to admonish Ms. Ball that if she cannot demonstrate a desire or commitment to ensuring that she has food and finding stable housing, then protective custody of Camille may be taken. In an interview wit h OIG investigators, PSA Beckman reported that although Ms. Ball's behavior was considered \"high risk,\" t he Department did not have \"urgent and immediate\" necessity to take protective custody. PSA Beckman an d CPI O'Neal both reported to OIG investigators that Ms. Ball was not officially homeless and was meeting Camille's needs appropriately. 14 No safety threats were identified on the CERAP. 15 CPI Marley denied referring to this incident as a \"parenting i ssue\" to OIG investigators. B-9 During the staffing, CWS Holmes was directed to inquire if Cami lle was seen by a doctor or not.16 Ms. Ball still needed to obtain her birth certificate, ID, and social se curity card which would ensure Ms. Ball's ability to secure appropriate housing and receive WIC benefits to make sure that Ms. Ball has adequate formula for Camille. In addition, CWS Holmes was to complete a referral for homemaker services to assist with these tasks as well as provide transportation to necessary appo intments. CWS Holmes reported to OIG investigators that he provided Ms. Ball with bus passes to assi st with transportation and she declined additional transportation assistance offered by CWS Holmes. On August 10, CPI O'Neal and CWS Holmes met with M s. Ball at De lta Refuge. Ms. Ball agreed to go to WIC on August 11, stated that she had a counseling appointment for August 12, and agreed to comply with anger management, homemaker services, and parenting classes. Ms .

During supervision on August 11, it was noted that Ms. Ball was engaged in domestic violence services through Delta Refuge and that Ms. Ball had acquired WIC service s. CWS Holmes directed Ms. Ball to have service providers from the shelter contact CWS Holmes so that C WS Holmes could confirm Ms. Ball's cooperation in services. 17 CWS Holmes and CPI O'Neal met with Ms. Ball, who reported that she had formula but could use more. CWS Holmes and CPI O'Neal both repo rted to OIG investigators that Camille was regularly observed to appear well fed and developing approp riately for her age. On September 1, CWS Holmes met with Ms. Ball and Camille and in troduced the homemaker service provider 18 to Ms. Ball. CWS Holmes again explained that Ms. Ball needed t o have Delta Refuge service providers contact CWS Holmes to confirm Ms. Ball's participatio n in services. CWS Holmes discussed the possibility that Ms. Ball may be asked to leave if she was not engaging in services. CWS Holmes confronted Ms. Ball that little to no progress has been made since case op ening and explained that this would need to be staffed with PSA Booker. CWS H olmes completed a 90-day CERAP , identified no safety threats, and Camille was assessed safe. CWS Hol mes again met with Ms. Ball a nd Camille approximately three weeks before Camille's death and CWS Holmes directed Ms. Ball again t o have domestic violence and mental health service providers contact CWS Holmes to confirm Ms. Ball 's participation and progress in services.19 Ms. Ball reported that Delta Ref uge would allow her and Camille to stay in the shelter for a few more weeks, at which point they woul d hold a review of Ms. Ball's ca se to address Ms. Ball's lack of compliance in group attendance. Ms. Ball reported that she was exploring h ousing in another town. CWS Holmes observed Camille and noted no concerns. CPI O'Neal continued to meet with Ms. Ball and Camille through the conclusion of the B- and C-sequence investigations. In September, CP I O'Neal requested all records from Ms. Ball's case in the other state. CPI 16 CPI O'Neal spoke with the primary care physician who reported that Camille was seen on June 29 for a well child exam but missed well child exams scheduled for August 3 and Aug ust 24, which resulted in Camille being behind on immunizations. 17 CWS Holmes obtained DCFS consent s but reported to OIG investig ators that Delta Refuge does not accept DCFS consents and require their residents to sign Delta Refuge conse nts, which need to be updated every 30 days. CWS Holmes reported that Maria did not complete Delta Refuge consen ts to allow for CWS Holmes to receive information regarding Maria's progress. 18 Private contractor to DCFS, Meredith Lang. 19 CWS Holmes reported that Delta Refuge required clients to comp lete Delta Refuge consents in order to provide information and Maria did not si gn Delta Refuge consents. CWS H olmes attempted to call Delta Refuge on multiple occasions and was told that inf ormation could not be released w ithout Delta Refuge consents. B-10 O'Neal also noted that two weeks prior to Camille's death, Ms. Ball reported to CPI O'Neal that she believed her older children shoul d remain in their grandmother' s care in the other state. CWS Holmes received supervision two days after the last meeting with Ms. Ball and Camille. CWS Holmes reported that Ms. Ball had not participated in parenting servic es, that he could not verify Ms. Ball's engagement in domestic violence and mental health counseling, a nd that Ms. Ball may be asked to leave her current shelter in a few weeks. PSA Booker directed CWS Hol mes to staff the case with the State's Attorney due to Ms. Ball's hes itation to cooperate with the Int act Family Services program. PSA Booker reported to OIG investigators that this was the first time a pe tition to the State's Attorney was considered as the Intact program usually allowed participants time to enga ge in services prior to referring the case to court. PSA Booker reported that it became apparent that Ms. Bal l was unwilling or unable to comply with Intact recommendations and therefore court involvement would be required. PSA Booker noted that Ms. Ball's placement case in the other state was due in court the n ext week and CWS Holmes would request information from the caseworker i n the other state regarding th e outcome of the hearing. CWS Holmes made continued efforts to meet with Ms. Ball and Cam ille and reached out to involved service providers who also reported that they had been unsuccessful in locating Ms. Ball since the last meeting with Ms. Ball and Camille. Approximate ly two weeks before Camille's death, another staffing was held with CPI O'Neal, PSA Beckman, CWS Holmes, and Intact PSA Booker and it was noted that Ms. Ball was about to be dismissed from another shelter due to noncompliance. Ms. Ball's extensive history with the Department was discussed and it was noted that Ms. Ball had not been compliant with taking Camille for well child exams or immunizations and having appropriate food f or Camille. CWS Holmes was directed to refer the case to court. PSA Beckman directed that Camille woul d need to be taken for a physical exam as she was behind on regular care. PSA Beckman reported to OIG inv estigators that protective custody was not considered at this time as there were still no safety issue s identified that would warrant protective custody. CPI O'Neal reported to OIG investigators that although Ms. Ball was not making progress and was inconsistent with services, there was no urgent or immediat e threat identified to justify taking protective custody of Camille. 20 The next day, CPI O'Neal received a call from Ms. Ball after on going attempts to contact her, and Ms. Ball reported that she had returned to Delta Refuge. Ms. Ball report ed that her phone had broken, and she was not trying to avoid CWS Holmes or service providers. CPI O'Neal transported Ms. Ball and Camille for a wellness exam at an urgent care clinic for Camille, who was not ed to be in the 91st percentile for height and weight and no concerns were identified by the doctor. Camille w as referred to follow up with a primary care physician to bring Camille up to date with immunizations a nd well child exams. Ms. Ball reported to CPI O'Neal that she would be forced to leave Delta Refuge due t o not attending group sessions but that she was not given a specific date of when she would be required to leave. In an interview with OIG investigators, CPI O'Neal reported that Ms. Ball had stated tha t she wanted to obtain housing on her own but also spoke of a connection with a church that may be able t o assist with housing.21 CPI O'Neal informed Ms. Ball that a referral had been made to court as Ms. Ball had not engaged in services and again reiterated the need for Ms. Ball to engage in services. CPI O'Neal then sp oke with CWS Holmes to update him on Camille's medical exam. In a final child protection supervisory note nine days before C amille's death, PSA Beckman noted that although Ms. Ball had run out of formula and had been giving Ca mille water and Pedialyte, Camille was 20 PSA Beckman and CWS Holmes both spoke of challenges with court referrals in their inte rviews with OIG. It was reported that the court is dealing with an especially high numb er of cases and referrals, and it can take up to six months from the time the court referra l is filed to getting a first ap pearance date. 21 CPI O'Neal did not obtain information regarding the housing op tion through the church and reported to OIG investigators that she was unaware of what CWS Holmes was doing in order to address housing with Maria. B-11 not in any distress and was overall healthy. Additionally, alth ough they did not know how long Ms. Ball was not giving Camille formula, Camille was assessed by a medic al professional and was found to be in the 91st percentile, so the lack of food at least for that day/moment d id not appear to have been significant enough to impact the child. CPI O'Neal and CPI Marley both repo rted to OIG investigators that Ms. Ball was not directly asked how long she had been without formula fo r Camille, and it was determined that the incident did not rise to the level of neglect as it was identif ied and addressed quickly. The C-sequence investigation was unfounded, and Ms. Ball was directed to conti n u e t o c o m p l y w i t h t h e I n t a c t F a m i l y Services program. CPI O'Neal reported to OIG investigators that the decision was made to unfound and close the C-sequence investiga tion because \"it was an education al issue\" that had been corrected. CPI O'Neal reported that a decision was made to keep the B-sequence open in order to receive and review the records from the other state and that the allegations in the B- sequence investigation were \"more pressing.\" Continued Intact Case The day after the child protection investigation closed, Ms. Ba ll completed a toxicology screening as was referred by CWS Holmes. The screening was positive for marijuan a and negative for all other substances. During supervision the next day, PSA Booker documented that Ms. B a l l n e e d e d t o r e e n g a g e w i t h t h e homemaker as Ms. Ball missed three consecutive appointments and that CWS Holmes had sent a referral to Blacksmith County State's Atto rney. CWS Holmes documented ad ditional ongoing attempts to contact Ms. Ball to schedule visits, wh ich Ms. Ball did not answer or r eply. Five days later, Ms. Ball texted CWS Holmes to inform him that she was out of town for a funeral and CWS Holmes explained that they needed to schedule a visit as CWS Holmes needed to see Camille. Two days after CWS Holmes received the text from Ms. Ball, it w as reported to the Hotline that Camille had died. (See SCR #2222222D below.) CWS Holmes noted he had directed Ms. Ball to notify him if she moved, as CWS Holmes would be required to assess the living environment a nd ensure Ms. Ball had approp riate sleeping arrangements for Camille. CWS Holmes noted that he did n ot know Ms. Ball had moved until being notified of Camille's death. The B-sequence child protection investigation was closed after the death. In November, a final supervisory note stated that the investigation would be indicated as there were concerns for Ms. Ball's ability to care for Camille. Ms. Ball left Camille with the grandfather and \"di sappeared,\" and her other children had been previously removed from her care in another state. Police recor ds obtained by CPI O'Neal indicated that Ms. Ball was involved in a domestic violence incident at a hote l in July 2021 with Camille present. Ms. Ball was arrested and failed to cooperate with the Intact Famil y Program. PSA Beckman noted that \"while this report was pending, another report was called in after the baby had been found deceased due to alleged unsafe sleep conditions.\" DEATH SCR #2222222D September 2021 - December 2021 Allegation #51- Death by Neglect to Camille Ball by Maria Ball- Indicated It was reported to the Hotline t hat 4monthold Camille was pro nounced dead at the hospital.

Both the child protection investigator and the Intact child welfare specialist documented discussing safe sleep practices with Ms. Ball on numerous occasi ons. Assigned CPI Bill Lerner23 went to the hospital to observe the child victim. CPI Lerner noted that Camille had no notable outward si gns of physical abuse and that life saving measures were attempted by both the responding EMTs and the hos pital medical staff. CPI Lerner spoke with a hospital nurse who reporte d that Camille arrived at the hospital at 8:26am unresponsive and the last time Camille was seen alive was at midnight. The nurse noted th at Ms. Ball appeared nonchalant but became emotional when she found out t hat Camille was deceased.

Ms. Ba ll admitted to co-sleeping and said that she knew she was not supposed to. Ms. Ball was indicated for Al legation 51 - death by neglect due to her blatant disregard for Camille by not taking reasonable, precaut ionary measures to ensure her safety. ANALYSIS A determination that a child s hould be removed from their paren t should only be made if there is reason to believe that leaving the child i n the care and custody of the p arent presents an immediate safety threat to the child, even if services are provided to the family. Camille 's mother had a significant history with another state's child protective services dating to 2016, which include d her two older children being removed from her care in September 2019. She was not compliant with services and her case was moving towards termination of parental rights. In April 2020, prior to Camille 's birth, her mother fled from the other state and moved to Illinois, presumabl y to avoid Camille from being t aken into custody. The Department failed to use the mother's history in the other state in assessing the current situation. In the four months that the mother was in Illinois, she showed little stability and was inv olved in three child protection investigations. Each time, the infant was assessed as safe, and it was determin ed that there was not \"urgent and immediate\" necessity to remove Camille from her mother's care. The first investigation involving this family opened June 3, 20 21, after another state's child protective services investigator reported to the Hotline that the mother f led to Illinois to give birth after she was informed that her newborn would need to be seen and assessed. C PI Majors, the assigned DCFS child protection investigator, spoke to the reporter and to the mothe r's placement caseworker from the other state that day, who both expressed serious concerns for the safety of the new baby due to the mother's unaddressed mental health and substance abuse issues. The other state's placement worker told CPI Majors that the mother had not followed through with any recommended s ervices including mental health treatment, substance abuse evaluation, parenting services, and maintaining adequate housing and 23 CPI Lerner is no longer a child protection investigator and cu rrently works for the DCFS Office of the Inspector General. B-13 employment. In addition, the mother was currently on probation in another state for assault of a family member. The other state's worker said that Camille would have b een taken into custody if she had been born in that state. The next day, CPI Majors located the mother and newborn at a sh elter. The mother told the investigator that she came to Illinois because there were no resources to he lp her in the other state. She confirmed her two older children were in foster care and said she was unable to complete recommended services due to transportation issues. The mother reported she completed a psyc hological evaluation but did not know mental health treatment and medication had been recommended. Sh e admitted to being on probation for assaulting a family member and reported that her probation offi cer did not know that she was in Illinois. The mother reported working with the shelter to obtain stable h ousing. The investigator completed a SAFE CERAP noting \"the mother does ha ve an open placement case in an other state but failed to get the support from her placement worker to get back on her feet,\" and the mot her agreed to intact family services. In child protection investigati ons, the child protection invest igator must assess and weigh all the evidence gathered during the investigation. While uncertainty in child p rotection is unavoidable, information sharing between professionals is key to valid risk assessment and shoul d result in better decision-making. In this case, the other state's child wel fare professionals shared ampl e information with DCFS about the mother's case history, lack of compliance, and current concerns for Cami lle's safety. Additionally, they reported that had Camille been born in the other state, she would have come i nto care. Despite this, DCFS did not take protective custody and allowed Ca mille to remain in her mother' s care and opened an intact family services case. The mother's self-report was seemingly given more weight in this decision-making process than child welfare professionals, who arguably have no ulterior motives to distort the facts unlike parents who may have powerful motives to m isconstrue information. Additionally, a court in another state had removed the mother's two older children in 2019 and determined that they had been abused and/or neglected. The mother was not compliant with services and the case was moving towards termination of her parental rights. When any cou rt finds that it is necessary to remove a child from the parent's care due t o abuse or neglect, there sho uld be a presumption that the same risks exist for any other minor in the care of that parent who has not made progress in correcting the reasons for child welfare involvement. Risks can change as circumstances change and should be assessed on an ongoing basis. Information gathering is a continual process, with new information needing to be incorporated with what is already known. The new information requires a review of past decisions and a reassessment of risk of harm. Critical analysis of the new information needs to occur in order to dete rmine its significance for the safety of the child. In the four months that the mother was in Illinois, she demonstrated little stability and was uncooperative with intact services. During this time, the mothe r regularly moved between shelters, motels, and relatives without notifying the intact worker; was terminat ed from services because she no longer resided at the shelter; was arrested for a domestic incident in volving another woman; and was observed feeding Camille water and Pedialyte, while admitting to not hav ing formula despite being eligible for WIC. Based on these new concerns, the intact worker made two additio nal Hotline calls - the first three weeks after the intact case opened and the second two weeks after tha t. During the subsequent child prot ection investigations, the Depa rtment had an opportunity to revise their initial risk assessment and correct their faulty logic relied u pon during the in itial investigation. Instead, the faulty logic guided future decisions, and in both investigation s, it was determined that Camille remained safe in her mother's care. CWS Holmes first contacted the Hotli ne after learning that the mother and infant were no longer residing in the w omen's shelter. The assigned in vestigator, CPI O'Neal, was instructed by her supervisor to speak with CWS Holmes to determine if there w ere safety issues with the mother caring for the child and if there were additional concerns because she left the shelter. That day, CPI O'Neal B-14 observed the 6weekold infant in the care of her maternal gran dfather, who was caring for the infant while the mother was in jail. While this investigation was pending, t he intact worker called the Hotline for a second time after receiving a call from the other state's casew orker who had done an online visit with mother and observed her feeding the infant only water. When assessing risk to a child, if the family has an open servi ces case with the Department, the child protection specialist must consider the degree of parental coop eration with services and the extent to which the provided services address the current allegation. This fami ly had open child welfare cases, a placement case in another state and an intact case in Illinois, and the m other was not cooperative with either. Rather than focusing on the outcome, assessments of decisions should c oncentrate on whether they were reasonable and appropriate for the circumsta nces existing at the time. The Department ignored information that supported a decision to remove the infant from the mother's car e. The information was readily available that the mother had a history of not cooperating with child wel fare services and posed a risk to her children due to her untreated mental hea lth and substance abuse issues. Within five weeks of the intact case opening, the intact worker had called the Hotline twice because of the mother's instability. The intact caseworker and the intact supe rvisor recognized that the risks to the infant continued and heightened as the intact case continued. They com municated their concerns about the mother's ability to care for her infant to the child protection investigator and supervisor. However, the child protection team believed they d id not have enough information t o take protective custody of the infant citing lack of urgent and immediate necessity. Intact staff als o communicated with the other state's child welfare staff, who expressed thei r continued concerns about the mother's ability to care for the infant. The mother was not meeting minimal pa renting standards. The intact worker and supervisor worked with child protection to provide the mother with formula and pack and play s and attempted to address her housing instability. The investigations r emained pending, and the intac t worker continued to struggle with engaging the mother in services for two months before Camille died. RECOMMENDATIONS 1.
