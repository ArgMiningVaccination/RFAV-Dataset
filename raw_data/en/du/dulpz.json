This kit is developed and manufactured through Genekam Biotechnology AG. It can be used on different kinds of samples e.g. serum, plasma, blood, tissue, cell cultures, vaccines, biopsies, oral swabs, nasopharyngeal samples etc. Isolated RNA is very pure to be used in different applications of real time as well as conventional PCR. It is simple to use and does not need expensive instrument except a magnetic rack. The isolated RNA can be isolated to conduct the analysis from different fields like virology (HCV, Influenza, Zika virus, dengue, West Nile virus, TBE, regenerative medicine, medical entomology, neurology, cell cultures etc. Isolation of RNA from the whole blood is a challenging issue in molecular biology. Genekam RNA isolation kit isolates RNA from different kinds of blood samples easily to provide user highest quality of RNA to conduct the various analysis. Isolated RNA can be stored for long term. Isolated RNA can be used directly in applications like one step PCR as well as two step PCR (where cDNA is synthesized). Quality of isolated RNA can be controlled through different instruments e.g. spectrophotometers as well as PCR assays like real time and gel agarose. Genekam has developed here the PCR kits to control the quality of isolated RNA. OD 260/230 or 280 can be calculated for each sample as this ratio should be more than 2.0 each sample. To prepare the NGS libraries, there is requirement of minimum concentration of RNA per ul in each sample. This varies between different methods raning from 2ng to 100 ng / ul. Genekam RNA isolation is quick, simple and economical. It is an universal kit to be used with vast variety of samples. 28S / 18S ratio is an important indicator of the quality of RNA to be used in next generation sequencing (NGS). RNA integrity is an important parameter for the success during NGS. Isolated RNA is meeting these requirements. NGS needs larger amount of high quality RNA, which can be isolated through this kit. In NGS, there are transcriptomes, which are easy to sequence. This kit is a right choice here. During RNA isolation, RNA can be eluted in molecular water and volume of eluted RNA can be between 50-200 ul. This amount is sufficient to conduct the NGS. Applications of isolated RNA are as follows: - Microarray analysis In situ hybridization assay RNA mapping In vitro translation cDNA library construction Northern blot analysis Next generation sequencing Real time PCR Conventional PCR Isolation of RNA from the whole blood is a challenging issue in molecular biology.
