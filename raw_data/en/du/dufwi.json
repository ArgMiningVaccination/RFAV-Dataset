Ayurveda medicine is an ancient system that only rishi-Muni or Rajvidhya knew about it but now many people are interested to know about the Ayurveda medicinal plants. A traditional method for the prediction of suitable herbs where the Rajvedhya examines the pulse is known as Nadi Priksha now the scenario is changed many technologies is developed, and machines are able to perform such a task. The main purpose of this research is to design a system for all the people who prefer to use herbal medicine for diseases. In this paper, we predict the suitable herbs for the disease by the characteristics of Ayurveda herbs by using the classification technique of machine learning. For this, we collected data on 200 herbs and define the suitability of herbs for disease.", "sitename": "ieeexplore.ieee.org", "date": "2023-09-10", "cleaned_text": "A not-for-profit organization, IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.\u00a9 Copyright 2023 IEEE - All rights reserved.
