It helps more than 300 enzymes work. It's needed for nerve and muscle activity. It also controls the electrical and muscle activity of the heart. Magnesium is in many antacids and laxatives. It's found in many foods. Because of this, magnesium deficiency is rare. Magnesium is needed for many functions in the body. These include: Magnesium helps bone and tooth enamel form. It's needed to convert protein, carbohydrates, and lipids into energy. It also helps make protein, RNA, and DNA. Magnesium helps break down (metabolize) many substances in the body.

Magnesium citrate is given to cleanse the bowel before taking X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs of the abdomen. It's used in some treatments for heartburn and upset stomach due to acid indigestion. Magnesium is also used to prevent and treat low magnesium levels. This is called hypomagnesemia. In hospitals, magnesium is used to treat preeclampsia and eclampsia. These issues can happen in pregnancy and right after childbirth. Magnesium works with calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone to make healthy bone tissue and tooth enamel.
