A Thesis Submitted to the School of Graduate Studies in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy McMaster University \u00a9 Copyright by Gail Butt, March 2009 ii DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY (2009) McMaster University (Nursing) Hamilton, Ontario TITLE: Partnership and Population Outc ome Relationships in Four Nurse-Led Hepatitis C Integrated Prevention and Care Projects AUTHOR: Gail Butt, M.H.Sc. (McMaster University) SUPERVISOR: Dr. Gina Browne NUMBER OF PAGES: ix, 106 (plus appendices) iiiABSTRACT Purpose : To examine four nurse-led integrated hepatitis C prevention and care projects on selected variables and thei r interrelationships: program development and composition, client/population reach and partne rship structure and functioning. Methods: A multi-method, descriptive comparative study of four projects from 2001 to 2007. Data were obtained from historical doc uments, a survey of project partners and two administrative datasets. Study assumptions were based on literat ure reviews and the study's conceptual model. Results : Between 2001 and 2004, four nurse-led pr ojects were initiated in small urban/rural areas in BC. Project nurses, recruited from public health, provided a continuum of services by expanding their scope of practice an d partnering with 216 professionals in health services, public health and ancillary services . The projects were similar in the type and number of services provided; the populations reached, and partner diversity and quality of functioning. Nurse- partner paired ratings for each project revealed high agreement indicating relationshi p stability. Significant differences between the four partnerships were found for the number of partners, mean depth of involvement (integration), and differences between e xpected minus observed involvement. The youngest project had the fewest partners (n= 29) and the greatest partner involvement while the oldest project evidenced the opposite characteristics (n= 68). Analysis of 2512 client records revealed that 72-80% attended for assessment; of those 26-32% initiated therapy, 12% withdrew because of adverse effects and 57-76% achieved a sustained viral response. Unadjust ed estimates indicated three of the four projects reached 25% of the infected population while adjust ed estimates indicated 29- 42% population reach. Conclusions : This is the first Canadian study to describe the relationship between nurse- led integrated services, interprofessional partnerships and population reach. Client/ population outcomes were similar to or better than those reported in the literature. This study extends knowledge of nurse leadership to front-line nurses working in community settings. Future studies should expand meas urement approaches to include input from care recipients and managers at particip ating organizations. Policy makers should consider expanding the role of public health nurses to include disease management for those with chronic infectious diseases where disease management services are underdeveloped. ivACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This thesis would not have been po ssible without the support, advice and encouragement of many people.

Services integration has now reache d that stature ...(p2).\" (Shields, 1999) 1 INTRODUCTION Partnerships have currency in the literature as a primary means to increase capacity for comprehensive chronic illness preven tion and care. Although the rationale for partnerships is logical, the li terature lacks a solid theore tical and empirical base. To increase our understanding of how nurses and other community-based practitioners partner to build capacity, studies are required that describe ho w partnerships form and the relationship between partners hip characteristics and clie nt/population outcomes. The purpose of this dissertation is to describe the demonstration project s and to measure and determine the relationship of partnership st ructure and functioning to population outcome measures of population reach in four, nurse-led hepatitis C integrated prevention and care demonstration projects that differ in year s of operation and geographic location. This dissertation proposes a theory-derived model of front-line interprofessional partnership and draws on the assumption that interprofe ssional partnerships (IP) arise through the provision of client/population-cen tred services. In the litera ture, the terms partnership, collaboration, and teamwork are used intercha ngeably to \"reflect th e idea of individuals coming together for a mutually accepted goal or mission\" (Boswell & Cannon, 2005). In this dissertation, interprofessional is the term used to describe the process of multiple disciplines working together, while the term partnership is used to indicate the collaborative nature of the process. In response to the epidemic proportions of viral hepatitis in BC, the provincial Ministry of Health funded the formation of BC Hepatitis Services at the BC Centre for Disease Control in 2001. The funding was provided for the development and implementation of a provincial approach for integrated viral hepatitis prevention and care. The concept of integrating the needs of populations (prevention) and individuals (care) recognized the paradox of trying to address the needs of affected individuals while serving the needs of the population. This disse rtation focuses on a ma jor initiative in BC Hepatitis Service's response to the hepatitis C (HCV) epidem ic through partnerships with Regional Health Authorities. Through partnerships with Regional H ealth Authorities (RHA) and nursing leadership, demonstration projects were esta blished in four geogra phic areas with high HCV prevalence rates: Campbell River, Ka mloops, Prince George and Surrey. The aim of the demonstration projects was to expand th e reach of hepatitis C services to small urban and rural areas throughout BC. The impl ementation of these demonstration projects was staged over three years, from 2001 to 2004. PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 21.1 Statement of the Problem 1.1.1 Why study partnerships? Within Canadian healthcare systems the de velopment of IP partnerships is being explored for the provision of comprehensiv e community-based chronic illness care to decrease costs, reduce gaps and improve services for an incr easingly long-lived population where chronic illness forms the ma jor burden of care (Epping-Jordan, Pruitt, Bengoa, & Wagner, 2004; Marriott & Mable, 20 02; Naylor, 1999). Chronic illness care requires a collaborative approach with multiple professionals contributing specialized and complementary knowledge to meet the divers e client/population needs (Curry & Hollis, 2002; Weaver, 2001; Zaccaro, Rittman, & Mark s, 2001; Zigurs, 2003). Chronic illness responses require interprofessional linkages between providers in public health and personal health services s ectors (Epping-Jordan, 2005). A lthough both sectors share the goal of a healthy population (L ubetkin et al., 2003), their difference in focus (i.e., prevention vs. care), has produced parallel sy stems with weak collaboration and linkages (El Ansari, Russell, Spence, Ryder, & Chambe rs, 2003; Public Health Agency of Canada, 2004; Shaw, Ashcroft, & Petchey, 2006). Persona l health services, usually provided in primary and tertiary care sett ings, are organized around a cura tive model largely confined to the biological and individua l aspects of health (St-Pierre , Reinharz, & Gauthier, 2006) whereas public health utilizes a population-ba sed preventative approach that includes the social and environmental aspects of health (Shaw et al., 2006). Adequate prevention and management of chronic illnesses requ ires a mix of these perspectives. Technological advances in communication that permit rapid information sharing within and between organizations open up ne w possibilities for the development of IP beyond the traditional approach in which me mbership is largely constrained to a particular organization (Rayport & Sviokla, 1995). Technological advances enable interprofessional services that include coor dination of providers working for multiple autonomous organizations through the use of electronic communicati on devices such as telephones, faxes, e-mail, e-bulletin boards, ch at lines and groupware such as Share Point and First Class (Townsend, DeMarie, & Hendrickson, 1998). IP of providers from multiple organizations can be developed thr ough formal or informal mechanisms and at different levels of the system. For example, partnerships can be formed through formal negotiations between managers in the various organizations as well as through informal collaborations between front-line providers du ring the planning and provision of chronic illness care (Sorrells-Jones & Weaver, 1999a). The initiation of informal IP by front-line staff utilizes leadership that is based on influence and trust rather than power and control (Sorrells-Jones & Weaver, 1999b). Nurses, as co re front-line providers in public health and primary care, are well-positioned to devel op and coordinate front-l ine IP but little is known about the nurse's role in community settings (Ciliska, Underwood, Ahluwalia, & King, 2007). There is evidence that nurses with basic as well as graduate level preparation provide leadersh ip in the prevention and management of HCV in the community especially regarding the provision of antiviral therapy (Ahern, Imperial, & Lam, 2004; Leone, 2002. PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 31.2 Why study partnerships in the target population? Chronic disease management approaches are applicable to HCV as the illness course is slow and progressive even in the advanced stages which include liver failure (Alter et al., 1992; Seeff et al., 2000). Features of chr onic disease management programs such as interprofessional and inter-sec toral partnerships, population/ client engagement, trust- building and peer support have been identif ied as applicable to HCV (Naffah, 2007; Zevin, 2007). As HCV is a relatively new disease, first identified in 1989 (Lauer & Walker, 2001; Lindenbach & Rice, 2005), serv ice delivery systems ar e still developing and professional service delivery mechanisms are not yet entrenched in the various sectors. Since HCV is both a chronic and hi ghly-infectious disease spread by blood-to- blood contact and there is no preventative vaccine, care of thos e infected requires interventions that bridge th e public health and personal he alth services sectors. HCV provides an ideal test case for examining IP because no single service modality or sector can address the complex needs associated with HCV and therefore it is thought that partnerships must be used to provide effective services. IP that bridge sectors afford opportunities to try new approaches to controlling the disease spread, reducing service gaps and applying lessons learned by others as we attempt to meet the need and increase acce ss and capacity for this new disease. For example, although HCV care was initially consider ed as a tertiary care specialist model (Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care, 2000; Herrera, 2007) it is now clear that specialists cannot meet the demand for services or provide for the comprehensive management of what for mo st is a chronic illness (Myers, Liu, & Shaheen, 2008; Zevin, 2007). Approaches that include public health, primary care and specialist services ar e called for to reduce the burden of HCV (Wong & Lee, 2006). In addition, interprofessional inter-sectoral partnerships increase the communication pathways required to assist providers to keep current with developments in the emergent and ever changing field of HCV. A summary of the state of know ledge of HCV, its management and associated issues is useful to illustrate the intertwining of cu rrent issues for provider s in public health and personal health services. As di agnostic testing for this small, single-stranded RNA virus, has been available only since 1990 (Clark & Ghalib, 1999; Pearlman, 2004) and population-based testing has yet to occur, pr evalence rates are based solely on estimates (Remis, 2004). Estimates may be low as they do not include data on some populations at high risk for acquisition of HCV such as the homeless and incarcerated (Edlin & Carden, 2006). However, present figures reveal that HCV is the second most common chronic viral infection in the world affecting a bout 3% of the population or 170 million people (Perz, Farrington, Pecoraro, Hutin, & Armstrong, 2004). Annually, 100,000 deaths are attributed to HCV and the rate is expect ed to triple by 2020 (Davis, Albright, Cook, & Rosenberg, 2003). In Canada approximately 250,000 individuals, including 60,000 British Columbians are chronically infected with HCV (Arm strong, 2003; Murray & Sherman, PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 41998) and only two-thirds of infected indi viduals have been identified (Remis, 2004). Across Canada, the highest rate s of infection are in BC followed by Ontario and Quebec (Remis, 2004). Costs associated with HCV in Canada are $500 million per year but are expected to reach $1 billion by 2010 (Leigh, Bowlus, Leistikow, & Schenker, 2001). The increasing burden on the health care system poi nts to the need for strategies to prevent HCV infection and reduce the disease impact by increasing access to services including provision of antiviral therapie s (Myers, Liu, & Shaheen, 2008). Engaging those affected by HCV requires knowledge of the modes of transmission and the differing populations affected. In de veloping nations, the major risks for HCV transmission are from the unsafe administration of therapeutic injections and transfusions from unscreened donors (Shepard, Finelli, & Al ter, 2005). In develope d countries illicit drug use accounts for 60 to 75% of infec tions and 15% from contaminated blood products prior to donor testing for HCV in 1990 (Chou, Clark, & Helfand, 2004; Remis, 2004; et al., 1998; Zou, Tepper, & El S aadany, 2000). The remaining risk factors are associated with high-risk sexual activity, and perinatal and occupational transmission (Remis, 2004; Shepard et al., 2005). HCV pr evalence rates are highest among illicit drug users ranging from 50%-95% (Patrick et al., 2001), meaning that this group is most at- risk for ongoing transmission. In Canada, 50-70% of existing infections are attributed to illicit drug use (Patrick et al., 2001; Zou, Tepper, & Giulivi, 2000). Data from the Public Health Agency of Canada national enhanced surveillance system suggest illicit drug use accounts for 65-93% of newly acquired HC V infections (Hong-Xing et al., 2006). Knowledge of exposure risks is important for case-finding as t hose newly-infected with HCV, even if they have access to hea lth services, will infrequently be diagnosed through clinical presentation. Most individuals are asympt omatic with only 15-30% of individuals reporting mild flu- like symptoms within 5-12 week s of exposure that last for 2-12 weeks (Marcellin, 1999; Orland, Wright , & Cooper, 2001). Of those infected 15- 40% will spontaneously clear the infection wi thin 6 months (Alter, 1993; Jauncey et al., 2004). Those with HCV infection beyond 6 mont hs, 55 to 85% of those infected (Seeff & Hoofnagle, 2002) are considered chronically infected. The ma jority of individuals with chronic HCV are thought to remain asymptom atic unless liver damage occurs, at which point their symptoms can be clearly linked to the disease. The most commonly reported symptoms, regardless of the stage of liver disease, are fatigue, difficulty with memory and concentration (\"brain fog\"), and chronic mu scle and joint pain leading to disabilities and reduced quality of life (Forton, Taylo r-Robinson, & Thomas, 2003; Hussain et al., 2001; Poynard et al., 2002). Lack of acknowle dgement or dismissal of these symptoms by health care providers has led to those affected feeling alienated and stigmatized (Golden, Conroy, Marie O'Dwyer, Golden, & Hardouin, 2006; Zickmund, Ho, Masuda, & LaBrecque, 2003). The issues associated with HCV discusse d extend beyond the disease. Populations affected by HCV are often stigmatized, have multiple health issues, are difficult to reach and engage, and have concurrent social and economic needs (Butt, Paterson, & McGuinness, 2008; Paterson, Butt, McGuinne ss, & Moffat, 2006). However, there are disease specific issues that must be consider ed in the response to the epidemic. Research PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 5has identified that progressive liver fibrosis, leading to cirr hosis, end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma will be experienced by 5% to 20% of individuals after multiple decades of infection (Seeff & Hoofnagle, 2002; Strader & Seeff, 1996). Emerging research links diseases such as t hose associated with auto-immune dysfunction such as arthritis, mixed cryoglobulinemioa and lymphoma to HCV (Craxi, Laffi, & Zignego, 2008). Once HCV is diagnosed a number of factor s must be considered in predicting progressive liver disease. Th e factors associated with in creased progression of liver disease include younger age at infection lberti, al., 2000), male gender (Poynard et al., 1997), co-infection with HIV (Benhamou et al., 1999; Darby et 2001; Graham et al., 1998; Ragni & Belle, 2001; Soto et al., 1997), non-alcoholic steatohepati tis (Adinolfi et al., 2001; Hui et al., 2003) and heavy alcohol consumption (Coelho-Li ttle et al., 1995; Corrao Locarnini, & Desmond, 1998; Pessione et al., 1998). Untreated, progressive liver disease from ch ronic HCV infection is associated with significant morbidity and premature death (S eeff & Hoofnagle, 2002; Strader & Seeff, 1996). For some, the availability of antiviral therapy is an importa nt means of clearing the virus and reducing the impact of liver di sease and its complications. Viral clearance following therapy has been shown to impr ove liver histology and prognosis (Lauer & Walker, et al., 2001; Niederau et al., 1998; Shepard et al., 2005), improvement in health relate d quality of life (Bernstein, Kleinman, Barker, Revicki, & Green, 2002), decreased likelihood of developi ng hepatocellular ca rcinoma (Hung et al., 2006) and improved survival (Yoshida et al., 2002). Overall, antiviral therapy has been shown to be cost-effective for reducing dis ease mortality and morbidity (Manns, 2004; Wong, 2006). Although treatment could potentially cure ~55% of individuals with HCV, it is estimated that only a small proportion of t hose infected have ever been referred for specialist consultati on and follow-up (Dalgard, Jeanss on, Skaug, Raknerud, & 2003; Mele et al., 2000). In addition, only 30% of people who are infect ed are eligible for treatment (Falck-Ytter et al., 2002; Fleming, Craven, T hornton, Tumilty, & Nunes, 2003). Of those who are eligible, many will refu se or find treatment intolerable because of its debilitating side eff ects (Pearlman, 2004). Presently, mo st of those infected will experience the impact of HCV as a chronic illness for decades and probably for life (Richmond, Dunning, & Desmond, 2004). For the small proportion of individuals who access current therapy, pegylated interferon and ribavirin, a cure, defined as a sustained viral response (SVR) 24 weeks after end of treatment, is possible. About 50% of individuals infected with the most common genotype (type 1) and up to 80% in those infected with genotypes 2 and 3 (Strader, Wright, Thomas, & Seeff, 2004) can attain a SVR. The standard course of therapy is 48 weeks for those with genot ype 1 and 24 weeks with genotype 2 and 3. PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 6However, this therapy is relatively new so optimal dosing and therapeutic duration has yet to be fully determined. Shorter durati ons of therapy could improve tolerability, enhance compliance and reduce the likelihood of premature discontinuation of therapy. Factors associated with the decision to undergo and/or complete antivir al therapy are: the duration of therapy, the comple xity of the therapeutic regi me (which requires intense laboratory and clinical monito ring), the likelihood of si de effects requiring dosage reduction and or treatment cessation (Falck -Ytter et al., 2002; Fleming et al., 2003; Zeuzem et al., 2004), and the social and financial hardships which often accompany treatment. Those that embark on therapy require a gr eat deal of support and close monitoring due to the variety of extra effects from the drugs and the associated difficulties of coping with added stressors. There are multiple extra effects from peginterferon with flu-like symptoms, muscle and joint pain and fati gue the most common (Fried et al., 2002; Hadziyannis et al., 2004; Manns et al., 2001). Neuropsychiatric side effects including depression, anxiety, irritiablit y, sleep disturbance and difficu lty concentrating frequently occur irrespective of a history of mental health disord ers (Ho et al., 2001; Mulder et al., 2000; Trask, Esper, Riba, & Redman, 2000). Other extra effects include cytopenia, anorexia, skin rash, headache, dizziness, and paresthesia. The most frequent extra effect from ribavirin requiring dosage reduction is anemia (Fried et al., 2002; Hadziyannis et al., 2004; Manns et al., 2001). Additionally, sinc e ribavirin is terat ogenic, adherence to birth control measures is required for both men and women receiving this drug. The frequency of occurrence of extr a effects and the complexity of their clinical management adds to the clinical time required with each cl ient to successfully manage their individual therapeutic regime. In summary, there are many facets to th e burden of disease presented by HCV and much is yet to be discovered. HCV is a disease of heteroge neous presentation and unclear symptomology. Those affected are largely di senfranchised groups, who have multiple needs associated with the disease and thei r life circumstances. A fragmented system creates additional barriers to meeting thei r diverse needs. Approaches to the HCV epidemic thus require consideration of impor tant aspects of lifest yle and other social determinants of health as well as disease specific aspects such as transmission and prevention, stages of illness, symptoms, prevention of progression, and options for antiviral therapy (Zevin, 2007, Naffah, 2007) . Prevention strategies are based on increasing knowledge of dis ease transmission modes within the population as well as changing and maintaining client behaviour to prevent furthe r transmission. In addition, although HCV infection may clear either spontan eously or through antiviral therapy there is no lasting immunity and reinfection can occur requiring continua l reinforcement of prevention education and vigi lance (Farci et al., 1992). 1.2.1 Interprofessional Partnerships for HCV prevention and care To situate and enable comparison of integrat ed services in the de monstration projects, a search of the research lite rature was undertaken to determine the nature and extent of the research on IP for HCV prevention and care and outcome indicators.

Butt McMaster - Nursing 8 strategy method and inclusion criteria are summ arized in Table 1.1. A total of 487 articles were identified, each title and abstract was re viewed for relevance. Seventeen articles were deemed relevant and retrieved for full review and data extraction. All but three of the studies were performed in the US. The re sults summarized in Table 1.2 reveal that research regarding HCV service configura tions has emerged mainly since 2005. These results are consistent with a similar sear ch by Stringari-Murray, Clayton & Chang (2003) covering 1998-2002 which failed to yield any ar ticles. All the studies were descriptive accounts of new or augmented health servi ces for those with HCV and/or HCV/HIV coinfection. The majority of studies covered sh ort time periods of a year or less. As the studies were descriptive in nature it was expected that theoretical frameworks would have been employed to guide identification of indi cators and interpretation of results however this was not the case. No cohort or other types of comparison st udies were found. Only one study included a 2-month before and 2-month after cross-ov er design to allow for comparison of usual practice, HIV testing only, with a new practi ce, combined HIV and HCV testing (Stopka, Marshall, Bluthenthal, Webb, & Truax, 2007). St udies that involved more than one site reported only aggregate results so no betw een-site comparisons were obtained (Arora, Thornton, Jenkusky, & Krajden, 2007; Kresina, Stopka et Stringari- Murray et al., 2003; Zimmerman, Finley, Rabins, & McMahon, 2007). Most studies provided descriptive accounts of service augmentation by interprofessional teams within single organi zations with the main focus on improvements in the process of care (e.g., improved case findi ng). Two studies repor ted IP comprised of professionals from autonomous organizations (Arora et al., 2007; Hill et al., 2008). No studies attempted to measure the structure or quality of the interprofessional processes as an indicator of integration effectiveness. A few studies described pr ofessionals' attitudes towards the provision of the new services but the comments were focused on demands emanating from program changes that increas ed work loads (Heseltine & McFarlane, 2007; Stopka et al., 2007). Most studies described programs that in tegrated individual client-based HCV prevention services into exis ting clinics where those at hi gh risk for HCV were thought likely to be found such as HIV (Clanon et al ., 2005; (Gunn, & Margolis, 2001; Subiadur, Harris, & Rietmeijer, 2007; Zimmerman et al., 2007), addiction services (Fahe y, 2007; Gunn et al., 2005; Litwin Sylvestre & Zweben, 2007), correctional faci lities (Klein et al., 2007), and general practice (Arora et al., 2007). Prevention serv ices included case finding th rough HCV antibody testing, education on transmission prevention and risk reduction, hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination, and advisement to seek medical evaluation and care.

Butt McMaster - Nursing 14Ongoing medical services, although integral to HCV care, were found to be difficult to access. Medical services were reported to be most accessible for those with HCV who were coinfected with HIV due to special f unding mechanisms for HIV services. For those with HCV infection alone some programs provided linkages to medical care by giving clients written information on how to access medical services (Gunn et al., 2001; Zimmerman et al., 2007), while others attempte d to facilitate referrals directly (Subiadu et al., 2007). One program reported a novel a pproach to increasing capacity for medical assessment and treatment by electronically li nking medical specialists with generalist physicians in rural areas (Arora et al., 2007). The specialists provided education and consultation services remotely using telemedicine techniques. Three studies reported that in addition to prevention services they were able to provide HCV specialty assessment, illne ss management and treatment through the addition of nursing positions and consultative support from specialists (Fahey, 2007; Hill et al., 2008; Stringari -Murray et al., 2003). The nurses provided initial assessments, education and support services to clients. For those on antiviral-therapy the nurses independently monitored and managed the ther apeutic regime including the management of adverse effects, dosage adjustment and laboratory monitoring. These nursing practices were supported by evidence-based therapeutic protocols and specialis t consultations as required. Both baccalaureate and masters prepared nurses performed these expanded roles. Study indicators and their anal yses comprised counts of se rvice utilization for new client services. Counts of positive anti body tests and information on the source of infection were reported as indicators and also for surv eillance purposes. The most frequently reported prevention service indi cators included the number of clients seen, vaccinations given, and antibody tests perfor med. While six studies reported on the number of antibody positive tests (Gunn et al., 2005; Gunn et al ., 2001; Subiadur et al., 2007; Zimmerman et al., 2007) only three studies reported on the number of clients who attended for a second visit to receive their test results (Gunn et al., 2001; Stringari-Murra y et al., 2003; Subiadur et al., 2007). Indicators for clinical management of HCV mainly captured the number of clients who received services or those provided with anti viral therapy. Five studies included the number who achie ved a sustained viral respons e following therapy (Clanon et al., 2005; Hill et 2008; Knott et al., 2006; Sylvestre & Zweben, 2007; Taylor, 2005). Overall, six studies reported on-site staff education as a new service but no statistics were provided (Arora et al., 2007; urray et al., 2003). One study reported the number of education credits issued for formal off-site education (Aro ra et al., 2007). This particular study was the only one that include d costs of antiviral therapies that were accessed from pharmaceutical companies for underinsured clients. No indicators were found related to cost-effectiv eness of the new services. The applicability of the US studies to th e Canadian context is constrained due to differences in healthcare systems. Central to the need for surveillance and case-finding services in the US was the issue that the populations targeted were mainly underinsured PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 15and lacked the financial resour ces to obtain the services. Stud y funds were used mainly to cover the costs of laboratory tests. Similar fi nancial barriers also limited accessibility to physician services. The identification of fina ncial barriers precipit ated questions on the appropriateness of screening populations for whom services are not a ccessible (Heseltine & McFarlane, 2007; Subiadur et al., 2007; Zimmerman et al., 2007). Although access to HCV services regardless of geographic loca tion is an issue in Canada (Myles, Wang, Krahn, & Mugford, 2008) the reasons are not asso ciated with those of a private health care system as Canada provides universal h ealth care for its population. For example, laboratory testing for HCV is free for users a nd readily available. Te sting patterns in BC indicate that high-risk populat ions actually test frequently for HCV antibodies (Dr. M. Krajden, personal communication, June 16, 2008) . In summary, there is a dearth of theory-based research and little published evidence to help de scribe, compare or evaluate integrated HCV models of care and almost none that is appropriate for the Canadian healthcare context. 1.3 Rationale for this study The findings from the literature review of HCV service integration are similar to those from studies of service integration for other diseases. There is a lack of comparative research to assist our understand ing of what type of service integration, in which context, results in improved client /population outcomes (Ouwens, & Pillen, 2004). Whether integrated care is more cost effective than traditional care is yet to be demonstrated (Fireman, Bartlett, & Selby, 2004). It is uncommon for models of integrated care to be replicated for comparison so information on what components of integrated models are unique to the local context and what could be more wide ly applied are unknown. The uniqueness of the local configurations along w ith the complexity of integrated care models compounds the challenges for evaluation of their effectiven ess (Pawson & Tilley, 2003). This type of research requires multiple methods, is time consuming and, given the newness of the field of inquiry, may add to our theoretical understanding but lacks definitive or clear results. The measurement of HCV integration woul d be advanced by the use of a common framework for evaluation based on a shared unde rstanding of integration and consistent use of selected performance measures (W ard & Fenton, 2007). In recognition of the context-specific nature of integration, th e proposed research is grounded in a theory- based model for the evaluation of integrated care in the context of IP within autonomous organizations at the front-line service provide r level. The model provides the basis from which the results can be interpreted. A pplication of the study methods to four geographically-dispersed programs and comp arison of the results will increase our understanding of what aspects of interprofe ssional service integr ation are unique and which are similar regardless of local circumstances. PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 161.4 Theoretical perspective In this study, a theoretical perspective and the partnership context are both assumed to be required elements to understanding IP. To provide the theoretical base for the exploration and measurement of IP of front- line staff a conceptual model was developed and used to validate tools to measure IP functioning. The model is grounded in complexity theory, a contemporary form of sy stems theory. Complexity theory has been applied for some time in the biological and phys ical sciences and more recently to the science of health services (Capra, 1996; McDaniel & Driebe, 2001; Prigogine, 1997). Complexity theory approaches require explor ation of the system's parts as well as the pattern of relationships among the parts (Cil liers, 1998; Wheatley, 1992). The conceptual model details the salient attribut es of IP processes, an important focus of measurement in this study, and identifies inte rrelated moderating factors and outcomes. A full description of the model constitutes Chapter Two. 1.5 Study Purpose This multi-method, descriptive comparativ e study was designed to describe the development of the projects and explore th e nature of the stru cture, function and outcomes of front-line staff partnerships created to provide comprehensive HCV prevention and care services in four comm unities. A secondary purpose was to explore the relationship of partnership structure and function to outcome measures of reach in four nurse-led hepatitis C in tegrated prevention and care de monstration pr ojects that differ in years of operation and geographic location. Reach includes measures at the individual clinical servic e and population level. 1.5.1 Objectives The following specific objectives were developed for the study: 1. Describe how the four integrated HC V prevention and care developed in each regional health authority. 2. Describe and contrast the partner structure in each of the four demonstration projects. 3. Describe and contrast the partnership func tioning in each of the four demonstration projects. 4. Describe and compare the outcomes of popul ation reach in the four demonstration projects by year of operation. 5. Describe the relationship between measures of structure, function and population reach. 1.5.2 Research Questions: On the basis of the literature review and the IP conceptual model, questions were developed to explore the relationship between the dependent variables, partnerships structure and processes and sp ecific population outcomes, and the independent variables, the setting and the ye ars of operation. PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 171. How were the four demonstration projects developed and what services do they provide? 2. Is there a difference among the demonstra tion projects and the outcomes related to population reach when compared by year of operation? 3. Is there a difference in the structure (numbe r, type of the partne rs and the strength of their linkages) in each of the four de monstration projects? 4. Is there a difference in measures of partnership functioning in each of four demonstration projects? 5. Is there a relationship among the demonstrati on projects and the va riables structure, function and years of operation? 6. Is there a relationship among the demonstrati on projects and the va riables structure, function, years of operati on and population reach? 1.5.3 Research Assumptions: The study's assumptions are derived from the th eoretical model and the literature review: 1. Integration of services through IP of front-line staff increases reach 2. The number and type of partners is cont ext specific (i.e., dependant on the specific HCV client needs and the local resources) 3. The number and diversity of partners will be larger in demonstration projects that have been in operation for greater lengths of time 4. Partnerships will extend beyond the ge ographic referral area served by the demonstration project 5. Less difference or greater congruence be tween the expected minus the observed scores on the IHSM indicates partne rs achieved what they expected. 6. Stronger linkages, indicated by higher scores on the IHSM, will predict higher synergy scores on the PSAT 7. Use of services is reflective of the need for services 1.6 Study Design: This research was designed as a multi-me thod, descriptive comparative study of four demonstration projects. Its aim was to colle ct and describe specific data about the partners involved in the four integrated prevention and care demonstration projects and to compare relationships between the independe nt and the dependent variables described below in 1.6.1. The study is presented from an insider perspective as the researcher was directly involved with and responsible for initiating th e negotiations for the development of the demonstration projects and facilita ting communication between the demonstration projects and the financial sponsor, BC Hepatitis Services, since inception. The study has three distinct but interrelated components: 1. A historical document review to determ ine how the hepatitis C prevention and care projects developed in each of the f our RHA and what services they provide, 2. An analysis of administrative data to determine the population reach of each of the four demonstration projects, and PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 183. A survey, given to the partners in each of the four demonstration projects, which included questionnaires to measure pa rtnership structure and functioning. 1.6.1 Study variables for components 2 and 3 above The dependent variables of this study cons ist of selected characteristics of the demonstration project partnerships (structure and function), and th e population reach of each project. The independent variables comprise the setting and the number of years of operation. 1.7 Limitations of the study The results, while specific to the four dem onstration projects, may be of interest to others planning partnership-ba sed service delivery models with consideration of the following limitations. The study was limited to the four demonstration projects within regional health authorities in BC and as such may not generalizable to other regions or programs. Generalizability of the results wa s also limited by the lack of comparative research and rigorously tested models to underpin the implementation and evaluation of IP of front-line staff in community-based inte grated care. As the partnership survey was completed at one point in time the results co uld not provide insights into changes in each project's partnership structures and functions over time. 1.8 Dissertation Plan This dissertation contains five chapters including this introdu ctory chapter. The second chapter presents the con ceptual model that serves as the theoretical guide for this research study of IP of fr ont-line service providers of HCV prevention and care. A previous version of the model was published in the International J ournal of Integrated Care (Butt, Markle-Reid, & Browne, 2008). Chapter three describes the study methods. Chapter four contains the results organized in the following sequence: a historical review of the project development and services, a summary of the project's population reach including demographics of the populations served and selected clinical outcomes for each year of operation, a summary and comparativ e analysis of the survey data of each project's partnership structur e and functioning. Chapter five, the final chapter concludes the thesis with a discussion of the major findings and their relevance to policy and practice. Included is a discussi on of revisions to the IP mode l presented in chapter two. PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 192 CONCEPTUALIZING AND TESTING PART NERSHIPS IN HEALTH CARE SETTINGS Partnerships are increasingly us ed to enhance health servi ce delivery in response to an explosion in chronic disease prevalence. A lthough partnerships will ultimately redefine how health services are c onfigured and delivered, little is known about how these partnerships function and th eir impact on outcomes (Polivka, Dresbach, Heimlich, & Elliott, 2001; Weiss, Anderson, & Lasker, 2002). The focus of this chapter is on the conceptualization and measurement of interp rofessional partnerships (IP) at the front- line, service provider group level. In the li terature, the terms part nership, collaboration, and teamwork are used interchangeably to \"reflect the idea of individuals coming together for a mutually accepted goal or mission\" (Boswell & Cannon, 2005). However, in this analysis, interprofessional is the term used to describe the process of multiple disciplines working together. Partnership is used to indicate the collaborative nature of the process. The multiple and often complex needs of populations affected by the epidemic of chronic illnesses require approaches that in clude both health and social services, and extend beyond traditional acute episodic health care and the services of any single organization (Barr et al., 2003; Conrad, 1993; Fleury & Mercier, 2002; Wagner, Austin, & von Korff, 1996; World Health Organization, 2005). In response, healthcare policies in Canada, as in other Western countries, require services to be integrated, often through pa rtnerships to meet increased demands (Department of Health, 1998a, 1998b; Glouberman & Zimmer man, 2002; Romanow, 2002; World Health Organization, 2005). Support for IP is so st rong in the UK that the National Health Service has legislation requiring mandatory he alth and social serv ice partnerships to break down traditional disciplinary barriers to collaboration (Department of Health, 1997; Glendinning, 2003). The span of IP can in clude anything from the coordination of individual clinical care by front-line staff to the manage ment of medical and social support services for specific populations th rough the creation of large health care organizations (Leutz, 1999). Goals common to all approaches are to provide the best quality, most appropriate and effective services, and reduce overlap, duplication and gaps in care (Leatt, Pink, & Guerriere, 2000; van Eyk & Baum, 2002). Research on coordination of individual care demonstrates that proactive and comprehensive care that includes health and social services improves health outcomes (Browne et al., 2001; Hay et al., 1999). The quantity, type and source of comprehensive care will vary according to the ne eds and resources of the clie nt at particular points in time (Browne et al., 2001; Browne et al., 1999). For example, clients with chronic hepatitis C, a chronic infectio us illness spread by blood-to -blood contact, present with multiple and changing needs associated w ith the disease and compounded by social, economic and psychological factors (Butt et al., 2008; Paterson et al., 2006). Responses to these needs increase partnership linkage s, through social services, to other human services representing the broad determinants of health such as welfare, employment, and wage replacement (Leatt, 2002). PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 202.1 Interprofessional Partnerships: History and Function IP in health care have a long histor y (Mackay, Soothill, & Webb, 1995; Rawson, 1994), as both public and not-for-profit agenci es have worked together to coordinate services, pool resources and achieve sh ared goals (Alter & Hage, 1993; Herman, Wolfson, & Forster, 1993). The public health li terature contains many descriptions of IP and guidelines for their formation (Bolton, Georges, Hunter, Long, & Wray, 1998; Lezau, Kingsbury, Lenz, Nelson, & Voehl, 1993). IP are initiated through formal and/or informal relationships in and across orga nizations and based on a common value, a holistic person-centred approach to care (Pirki s et al., 2001). Nurses, as core providers in the provision of chronic illness care, freque ntly coordinate IP (Sibbald, Laurant, & Reeves, 2006). Communication can occur in-per son or through a vari ety of means such as phone, fax, e-mail and internet portals. IP function in wa ys that transcend organizational boundaries (Provan, Nakama, Veazie, Teufel-Shone, & Huddleston, 2003) resulting in the emergence of virtual intero rganizational structur es (Durbin, Rogers, Macfarlane, Baranek, & Goering, 2001). IP are defined in this paper as virtual interorganizationa l structures formed around client n eeds through formal and/or informal relationships of front-line service providers from various organizat ions who collaborate to provide comprehensive and integrated care and support serv ices to those with chronic conditions. Although partnerships are widely embraced, research on the factors that influence their collaborative processes and outcomes is not well established (Polivka et al., 2001; Weiss et al., 2002) and evidence of effectiv eness is lacking (Bu tterfoss, Goodman, & Wandersman, 1993; Morris, 1996; Zwarenstein & Reeves, 2000). There is evidence that partnerships frequently fail (Kreuter, Lezin, & Young, 2000), they are complex to administer, time consuming to establish, requ ire investment of scarce resources and have a potential for loss of decision-making control (Alter, 1993; Cheadle et al., 1997; Wandersman, Goodman, & Butterfoss, 1997). Th e increased emphasis on health system performance improvement through partnerships and the concomitant need to demonstrate that partnerships are functioning efficiently underscores the need to review partnership measurement issues, develop an IP conceptu al model and identify measurement tool(s) for its evaluation (Halliday, Asthana, & Richardson, 2004). 2.2 Methods: Search and Data Analysis To conceptualize IP and evaluate measur ement tools, a lite rature review was performed on published papers from Canada, USA, UK, Europe and Australia retrieved through three interrela ted searches (Table 2.1). The literat ure was searched to identify: 1) issues associated with the m easurement of partnerships, 2) the salient attributes of IP processes at the front-line staff level and the interrelated contextual factors of importance for measurement, 3) tools to measure IP f unctioning at the front- line service provider group level. The second search did not aim to identify literature for the development of a predictive model with weighted criteria. The search method was iterative starting with broad searches of online databases and the authors' personal libraries, selecting releva nt articles, identifying the articles' main PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 21Table 2.1: Search strategies Timeframe 1990-2007 Key words and terms combined for Search 1: Partnership measurement & Search 2: Partnership characteristics Search 3: Partnership measurement tools 'Partnership' and 'interprofessional' and 'measurement'. Search 2 dropped measurement term. Synonyms and variations of keywords were employed in the first 2 searches to expand and refine the search scope. Synonyms included: 'scales', 'tools' and 'questionnaires'. Restrictions English language, peer reviewed systematic reviews, primary research, conceptual articles, government research reports and books Databases searched Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Clinical Evidence, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsychINFO, & Health and Psychosocial In struments, Google, Google Scholar Hierarchy of evidence In ascending order systematic review articles (e.g., syntheses of research, concept analysis), single studies, articles and books. Types of literature Nursing, medici ne, social sciences and psychology (including selected refere nces from organizational development) Other documents added to the literature review Seminal works added as requi red to complete writers' understanding of the concepts. Reference sections were hand searched to ensure completeness. Mesh Headings, and repeating the electronic se arch using refined terms and, for selected articles, using the online \"find similar\" re ference feature. Hand searching reference sections of selected articles and electr onic searches of leading authors was also conducted. The thematic analysis (Charmaz, 2002) of the literature retrieved was guided by complexity theory which is further discussed in section 2.4. For example, complexity theory was used to guide the selection of attr ibutes to be measured, cluster the attributes into themes and conceptualize the pattern of in terrelationships within the context of an IP as a complex adaptive system (Anderson & McDaniel Jr., 2000). The literature obtained from search one was analyzed to identify the issues and gaps of partnership measurement. Th e literature from search two was analyzed to identify the salient attributes of IP processes at the front-line staff level and the interrelated contextual components of the conceptual framework. Salient attributes were defined as the recurrent PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 22characteristics of the concept of IP found within systematic reviews and concept analyses (Rodgers, 2000). All articles were read severa l times by the author to identify and code the themes. Qualitative analysis software, NVivo 7, was used to facilitate inquiry, refine the coding structure and organize the thematic relationships. The pr ocess was repeated by a trained research assistant to ensure that consensus was achieved. Tools to measure partnership functioning id entified in search three were required to meet all of the following criteria to be cons idered for full review: a) the purpose of the instrument is to assess partnership processes at the level of the gr oup, b) the tool has good theoretical concordance with our conceptualization (i.e., the salient attributes and theory base), c) there is at least one published reliability and validity assessment, d) the instrument is suitable for self -report and, e) is cu rrently available for use. The criteria were applied in ascending order and tools were rejected at the first failed criteria point. This process was necessary to ensure that the most robust and well-developed tools would be located and evaluate d (Streiner & Norman, 2003) and would fit with the chosen theoretical framework of complexity theory. Review of the selected instruments, gui ded by criteria identified by Streiner and Norman (2003), included a description of the to ol, the history of development, theoretical relevance, ease of use, reliability, and validit y. Reliability included appraisal of test-retest and internal consistency and sensitivity. A ssessments of validity included a review of face, content, construct, predictive, criterion, and discriminant validity. 2.3 Issues Associated with the Measurement of IP IP measurement is complicated by the fact th at there is no standa rd interpretation of the concept of partnershi ps (Ahgren & Axelsson, 2005) . Other challenges involve variations in form, content and change over ti me. Partnerships occur in numerous forms, vary in depth of involvement, number and di versity of members (including diverse views and agendas), and are established through a pr ocess of negotiation (H alliday et al., 2004). Even if the members remain constant their relationships can change over time (Goldberg & Comins, 2001). Comparing the findings from partnership re search is problematic due to the conceptual variation, the variety of research methods used and the tendency of disciplines to work within their respec tive research paradigms and theoretical perspectives with little crossover or mutual recognition (evidenced through lack of cross- discipline citations) (Ahgr en & Axelsson, 2005; Alexander et al., 1996; Bolland & Wilson, 1994; Lasker & Weiss, 2003a). Additionally, different stakeholders may attach different weights to success criteria (Boyne , Farrell, Law, Powell, & Walker, 2003; Glendinning, 2002; Sullivan & Skelcher, 2002) . The diverse views associated with partnerships and their measurement has added breadth to the field but a consensus view of partnerships has not yet emerged. There is an abundance of support for partners hips and rhetoric on their advantages in the literature but th e evidence-base is l acking (Butterfoss et al., 1993; Morris, 1996; Zwarenstein & Reeves, 2000). Part nerships have been evalua ted in a few studies that measured outcomes in client or populati on health and the qua lity of the group's PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 23collaborative process but the results are inconclusive (B ickman, 1996; Lehman, Postrado, Roth, McNary, & Goldman, 1994; Provan & M ilward, 1995). Aside from methodological deficiencies, an explanation for the lack of positive clinical outcomes is that these outcomes may take years to re alize and would fall outside most study timeframes (Provan et al., 2003). Partnership pro cess outcomes, on the other ha nd, occur earlier and can be measured at different time points. However, the literature on front-line staff collaborative processes focuses on relationships with clie nts, largely ignoring relationships with colleagues (Robinson, 2005). The research on healthcare teams has focused on single elements that have been studied individually within the context of formal meetings (Cott, 1997). Collaboration that occurs outside meetings is unstudied. For the purposes of this analysis, the assump tion is made that collaborative processes may not be sufficient to improve health outcomes, but that quality interprofessional collaborative processes are necessary precurs ors to improved services and outcomes for individuals and populations with chroni c conditions. Thus, the measurement of interprofessional collaborative processes is a necessary step in understanding whether quality processes contribute to better health outcomes. 2.4 Applying complexity theory to IP functions IP are complex adaptive systems as c onceptualized through complexity theory (Anderson, Crabtree, Steele, & Mc Daniel, 2005). As such, IP were considered as self- organizing interorganizational systems that experience change within the group and are influenced, but not controlled by factors extern al to the group. For example, as nursing and other providers self-organize in response to the needs of those w ith chronic illness, IP are created through increases in connectivity (number of partners), diversity (type of partners) and interactions (fre quency of interactions). The increase in information flow and feedback loops precipitate mutual adjustme nt of, for example, behaviours, beliefs, or plans in response to changing demands. Mutual adjustment occurs through learning that allows for creativity, reflection and evaluation. Mutual adjustment is a type of change process in which the outcomes are unpredictabl e and small changes can have large effects by changing the context for ot hers in the partnership (P lsek & Greenhalgh, 2001). The culmination of change through mutual adjust ment is termed 'adaptation' otherwise referred to as emergence, innovation and synergy (Holden, 2005; Lasker & Weiss, 2003b). Thus the complexity of chronic illnes s management requires IP be responsive to unpredictable changes in clie nts' chronic condition/problem s (Rowe, Jacobs, & Grant, 1999). Adapting plans and practices to cha nging conditions requires responsive and flexible partnership processes in order to produce the desired outcomes and impact (Capra, 2002; Wheatley, 1999). 2.5 Identification of Salient Attribut es and Conceptual Model of IP The analysis began with revi ew papers in accordance with the hierarchy of evidence in Table 2.1. The papers from which the salient attributes of IP were primarily selected were reviews of empirical studies of the de terminants of interprofessional collaboration (Center for the Advancement of Collaborativ e Strategies in Hea lth, 2006; Curran, 2004; PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 24San Martin-Rodriguez, Beaulieu, D'Amour, & Fe rrada-Videla, 2005), a review of theory and research on interagency collaboration in the public sector (Hudson, Hardy, Henwood, & Wistow, 1999), and concept analyses of hea lth care partnerships (Bidmead & Cowley, 2005; D'Amour, Ferrada-Videla, 2005; Hook, 2006; San Martin-Rodriguez et al., 2005). The attributes of IP to be measured that were selected from the data are itemized in Table 2.2 within four thematic areas; 1) agreem ent of the need to partner, which was the most frequently recurring theme in the literature, 2) collegial relationships, a theme which contains items related to interprofessiona l communication, 3) inte rdependency, a theme that is stressed in th e literature as central to group functioning and, 4) a final cluster, entitled power and leadership, which represents attributes consistent with shared power and leadership through influence. The attributes selected are congruent with complexity theory (i.e., attributes which contribute to self-organ ization, connectivity, diversity and interactions). Agreement of the need to partner is a necessar y, if not sufficient, requireme nt for self-organization. It affects the number and diversity of partners and the frequency of their interactions. Collegial relationships impact the information flow of a system, affecting the level of mutual adjustment and resulting interdependenc y. Attributes of leadership and power are characteristic of a self-organizing system as they emphasize a shared process that occurs through influence rather than a pos ition of power and control. Figure 2.1 displays the conceptualization of the attributes of interprofessional collaborative processes to be measured situated within the interorgan izational system that contains external influences or moderating factors and out comes. The processes within and between the components of the system are dynamic but displayed as linear for the purposes of heuristic simplic ity. The external factors th at influence IP member's participation found in the literature are termed 'organizational' and 'systemic' factors, detailed in Table 2.2 and displayed in Figur e 2.1. Organizational and systemic influences are conceptualized as moderating or influencing factor s as they can act as both barriers as well as enhancing factors (El Ansari, Phill ips, & Hammick, 2001). Finally, outcomes of interprofessional processes complete the conceptual model in Figure 2.1 and are presented under the categorie s of Partnership Functioning , System Capacity and Individual/Population Health Outcomes . These outcomes are interrelated and assumed to be time dependent with quality partnership processes leading initially to beneficial outcomes for the partnership. Feedback loops wi thin the system could result in changes in the moderating factors such as benefits to th e partner's parent orga nization or changes in wait time policies. Outcomes related to moderating factors are termed 'system capacity' in Figure 2.1. The final category, Indi vidual and Population Health Outcomes , includes partnership outcomes such as client satisfac tion, improved health and quality of life, and reduced incidence of disease.

Butt McMaster - Nursing 282.6 Evaluation of Tools to Measure IP Functioning A total of 171 instruments were screened for review, of which, 168 were rejected because they did not have an explicit theory base from which to determine concordance with the conceptual model as required by the second inclusion criter ia. Of the remaining 3 instruments, one instrument\u2014the Task Force Member survey\u2014was grounded in theory but rejected as I was unable to obtain the instrument or a history of its development and testing (McMillan, Florin, Stevenson, Ke rman, & Mitchell, 1995). Thus, only two instruments met the stringent selection crit eria, the Partnership Self-Assessment Tool (PSAT) (Center for the Advan cement of Collaborative Stra tegies in Health, 2006), and the Team Climate Inventory (TCI), (Anderson & West, 1998). The Partnership Self-Assessment Tool (PSAT), was developed by public health specialists for practical use by groups working to promote h ealth and well-being in their communities (Weiss et al., 2002). It measures partnership synergy and other related dimensions of the partnership process (L asker, Weiss, & Miller, 2001). This self- administered tool takes 20 minutes to comp lete and contains 11 domains and 67 clearly written and easily understood items. Seventeen items employ a dicotomous yes/no scale and 50 use a 5-point Likert scale. The origin ators caution that the PSAT is not intended for use by external evaluators to avoid the social desireability bias inherent when evaluations are perceived to be tied to funding decisions. The Team Climate Inventory (TCI), a self-administered measure of team innovativeness, was rigorously developed by organizational psychologists Neil Anderson and Michael West (Anderson & West, 1994). It was developed for research and practical use to evaluate team functioning at the level of the group (Anderson & West, 1994). The TCI has three versions, with 61, 38 or 14 clearly written and easily understood items that are scored on 5 to 7-point Like rt scales (Anderson & West, 1998). The 38-item scale which contains an additi onal six items inserted to meas ure social desirability bias (Mathisen, Einarsen, J\u00f8rstad, & Br \u00f8nnick, 2004) is referred to in this paper as a 38-item scale. It is the most frequen tly reported version, is availabl e for purchase (starter kit $495 USD, group norms and scoring software prov ided), and requires only 15 minutes to complete. The level of analys is is the group (permanent or semi-permanent) within an organization. The items in both the PSAT and TCI exhibit concordance with the salient attributes of IP as illustrated in Table 2.3. The TCI does not have an item match in theme 1, Agreement (agreement to participate is a ba sic assumption of their theory), while the PSAT had item matches in all themes. Item matching of the TCI with the PSAT, shown in Table 2.4 with the identified attributes of IP, re veals that the TCI matches are mainly related to group synergy which is in accordan ce with the stated purpose of the tool. Both measures have well-described theoreti cal frameworks that are consistent with complexity theory as both take a complex adaptive systems persp ective toward group PhD Thesis - G.

Butt McMaster - Nursing 30process. The PSAT is based on partnership synergy theory (Lasker & Weiss, 2003a; Weiss et al., 2002). Synergy is defined as \"t he breakthroughs in th inking and action that are produced when a collaborative process successfully combines the complementary knowledge, skills and resources of a group of participants\" (Lasker & Weiss, 2003b). Attributes of improved thinking include crea tivity, invention, challe nging the status quo and innnovative problem-solving (Gray, 1989; Richardson & Allegrante, 2000). The theory considers synergy a proximal outco me of good quality pa rtnership processes (Lasker et al., 2001). The concept of synergy, as used in the PSAT, is a surrogate for the concept of adaptation in complexity theory. Both con cepts are assumed to represent the ultimate proximal outcome of successful partnership pr ocesses. Additionally, successful processes require the ability of partners to interact effectively in order to understand and address complex problems and sustain interventions. Success is related to who is involved (number and diversity of members) and how th ey are involved which includes fluent and frequent interactions and sh ared leadership (a bottom up, self-organized approach to problem-solving). The TCI is based on the four-factor theory of climate for innovation (West, 1990), a well-studied model of team innovation (Mathi sen et al., 2004). This theory assumes teams are the principal means in which a clim ate of sharing grows, through active social construction, and becomes embedded with in the organization (Hosking & Anderson, 1992; West, 1995). Three criteria determine a te am: 1) work interactions occur at least infrequently, 2) a common goal or outcome se rves as the impetuous for collective action, and 3) interdependent tasks require the group members to develop a shared understanding and expected patterns of response (Hoski ng & Anderson, 1992; West, 1995). Climate for innovation is defined as, \"the manner of work ing together that the team has evolved\" (Anderson & West, 1994). Innovation is define d as \" the intenti onal introduction and application within a role, group or organization of ideas, processes, products or procedures, new to the relevant unit of a doption, designed to specifically benefit role performance, the group, the organization or the wider society\" (West & Farr, 1989). Creativity is considered to be part of the innovation process (Amabile, 1996). Innovation, as described in the four-factor theory, is synonymous with the concept of adaptation within complexity th eory (i.e., the intr oduction and application of new ideas or processes that benef it the group, organization or societ y). Climate is presented as a collective level phenomena requ iring self-organiza tion, connectivity a nd feedback loops as precursors to innovation. For example, task interdependence leads to shared understandings and expected le vels of behaviour. Interactio ns are participatory and new ideas are encouraged in congruence with a bottom up approach. A common goal or attainable outcome (agreement of the need to collaborate, an assumption in their model) unites individuals to collec tive action (feedback loops). Both the PSAT and TCI have reported measur es of reliability and validity which are summarized in Table 2.5. The PSA T is in the early stages of testing with the data PhD Thesis - G.

Establishmen t of face and content validity during development of the PSAT items was rigor ous. It included data from qualitative interviews with members of community hea lth promotion partnerships, an extensive review of relevant literature and measures, as well as input from a panel of experts (Weiss et al., 2002). Items were constructed at the group level and pretested in 2 series (N=11x2) of cognitive (think-aloud) interviews to be sure the items were relevant, clear and consistently interpreted, reduce the likeli hood of measurement e rror, improve content validity and minimize the burden on participan ts (Forsyth & Hubbard, 1992; Streiner & Norman, 2003). The PSAT was tested in 63 health-related part nerships in operati on at least 18 months in urban, suburban or rural areas in the US (Weiss et al., 2002). Reliability testing of PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 33internal consistency of the scales with the total score as measured by Cronbach's (.82 to .97) was good. Construct validity through factor analysis of the nine items on the synergy scale (.742 to .893) indicated good internal construct validi ty. Between group discriminant validity evaluated by one-way anal ysis of variance tests indicated that the PSAT adequately discriminates between gr oups. Criterion validity demonstrated through comparison of the PSAT with two more and less related measures evidenced that the PSAT measures different but re lated constructs. The closel y related measure showed a moderate correlation of .71 (p<.01) . Exploratory factor analysis of the items in each tool revealed each had a major and distinct fact or, synergy for the PSA T and collaborative group performance for the comparator (Weiss et al., 2002). The PSAT had a low correlation (r = .13 to .36) with the less related measure of partnership structure (Browne et al., 2004). The TCI has performed well on re liability and validity testin g in several countries and organizational cultural contexts including co mmunity-based health and social services settings. Face and content validity were es tablished through a rigorous process of initial scale development (Anderson & West, 1994). For example, items were selected from the literature and other published m easures of climate only if they were relevant to the four- factor theory and occurred at the group level. Reliability tests of internal consistency have consistently be en within recommended ranges. The items are moderately correlated with each other ( coefficient 0.35 to 0.62) (Anderson & West, 1998). Internal consistencie s of tool scores are consistent across countries. For example, an -coefficient of 0.84-0.94 in the UK (Anderson & West, 1998), 0.86-0.91 in Sweden (Agrel l & Gustafson, 1994) and an -coefficient of 0.84 to 0.90 in Canada (Loo & Loewen, 2002). Only one study has reported on the TCI's ability to measure change (sensitivity) (Loo & Lo ewen, 2002). Measures taken 9 weeks apart on both the 38-item and 14-item TCI showed high positive correlations between the scores on the scales at both administrations ( .61 to .87). However, it was predicted that a sensitive measure would show a change as the teams were given traini ng to increase team work at the beginning of the project. It is po ssible that change occurred but the TCI was not sensitive or the study timef rame was too short for significant change to occur within the newly formed teams. Criterion validity tested through comparis on with the Team Production Questionnaire showed a positive correlation of 0.14 to 0.51 but the power of the sample (N=16 teams) was small and not all correlations were statis tically significant indicating that the TCI may be measuring similar as well as different constructs . However, several studies have compared external evaluations of innovativen ess of the teams with the TCI scores and found good concordance evidencing criteri on validity (Agrell & Gustafson, 1996; Burningham & West, 1995; Mathisen et al., 2004; West, Smith, Feng, & Lawthom, 1998). Construct validity of the 61 and 38-item versions of the TCI tested through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis by several re searchers has produced mixed results on whether the TCI contai ns four or five factors. E xploratory factor analysis on PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 34the longer version in the UK indicated ther e are five interrelate d factors (Anderson & West, 1998). Confirmatory factor analysis co mpleted in the UK on the 38-item version of the TCI was equivocal for the four and five factor model (Anderson & West, 1998). The authors chose the five factor version to ma ximize the predictive uti lity. Ragazzoni et al. (2002) confirmed five factors in the 38-item Italian versi on. Testing by Kivim\u00e4ki et al. (1997) on a Finnish sample of 2,265 local gover nment employees indicated that the five factor version performed better than the four factor version in work groups with high job complexity while the four factor version was adequate for those with low job complexity. The findings indicate that the five factor sc ale is the most relevant for IP due to the complexity of their work. Between-group discriminant validity was adequate. Williams & Laungani (1999) demonstrated the TCI distinguished primary h ealth care teams from three other types of health care teams and Bain, Mann & Pirola-M erlo (2001) showed the TCI discriminated between research and developm ent teams (N= 38). Several studies have shown the TCI is predictive of team innovation (Agrell & Gustafson, 1994; Anderson & West, 1996; Forrester, 1995). For example, Anderson and West (1996) found that the factor, support for innovation, predicts overall innovation (accounting for 46% of the va riance) and innovative novelty. The factor, participative safety, best predicts the nu mber of innovations and team self-reports of innovativeness while task orientation predicts administrative effectiveness. 2.7 Summary of the PSAT and TCI evaluation The PSAT and TCI theoretical frameworks were compatible with the conceptual model. The PSAT items demonstrated a better fit with the entire model while the TCI items exhibited a fit specifically with the sa lient attributes. Both tools have rigorously demonstrated face and content validity. The PSAT is relatively new and has had minimal reliability and validity testing. The TCI is a mature tool that has performed well on a diverse array of tests, in many cultures and contexts. Bo th measures are appropriate for health and social services groups. Neither measure has demonstrated utility as a longitudinal measure of change. Both coul d be used for IP measurement research. 2.8 Discussion of the Conceptual Model a nd Selection of the Measurement Tool A broad and diverse literature review hi ghlighted the issues relevant to the measurement of IP of front-line staff within an interorganizational context. IP were presented as necessary for the delivery of se rvices to individuals and populations with chronic conditions in order to meet changing client needs. A new conceptual model was presented that assumes interrelatedness between the salient attribut es of group process, the external factors that influence group process and outcomes. The conceptual model contains both a theoretical perspective and th e partnership context as necessary elements (Granner & Sharpe, 2004). This model addresses limitations pointed out by Allen and Hecht in their review of the effectiveness of organizational team s \"the organizational context in which teams operate is rarely cons idered even though cont ext is quite likely to influence team success\" (Allen & Hecht, 2004, p.452). PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 35The complexity theory-bound conceptual model may be useful for IP that go beyond the front-line staff level as reviews of empirical resear ch in the UK suggest that partnerships have common principles regardle ss of the organizationa l level (Halliday et al., 2004). Refinement and testing of the model from multiple perspectives would improve the theoretical formulation and c ould lead to a mid-range theory to ground research and clinical practice. The evaluation of two tools, the PSAT and TCI, provided evidence of their validity for IP process measurement. While both tool s have a good theoretical fit with the model and the salient attributes of IP only the PSAT included measurement of contextual influences. The TCI would require supplementa tion with qualitative re search to uncover effects of contextual influences. The eval uation also included c onsideration of the instruments' psychometric properties. There was ample evidence that the TCI has strong psychometric properties while knowledge of the PSAT's performance is limited. However, the best tool is one that matches the partnership model, the community context, needs and goals of the partnership members a nd other stakeholders and the goals of the researcher (Granner & Sharpe, 2004). In c onsideration of the above, the PSAT was chosen as the instrument to test partnershi p functioning in four IP comprised of members from several agencies dedicated to providing care to those with chronic hepatitis C in small urban environments. PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 363 METHODS A multi-method approach was employe d that utilized both qualitative and quantitative methods for the th ree distinct study components: historical document review, statistical analysis of administ rative data and of pa rtner survey data. Qu alitative data from historical documents and the two open-ende d questions on the IHSM (partner survey measure) were subjected to thematic analysis (Charmaz, Sandelowski, 2000; Thorne, Kirkham, & MacDonald-Emes, 1997). obtained from the two survey measures (IHSM and PSAT) and admini strative data housed at the BC Centre for Disease Control were subjected to descriptiv e analytic techniques for parametric and non- parametric data. The data collection periods for each component of the study overlapped. The timeframes for data collection are repo rted separately for each component. 3.1 Data Sources and Timeframes 3.1.1 Historical Documents and Reports The historical data were contained in written documents from 2001 to 2007. The documents included program descriptions, annu al reports, manuscripts and information presented at yearly meetings in which repres entatives from the projects, mainly front-line project nurses and their managers, and BCHS shared and compared their progress and experiences. 3.1.2 Administrative Data Administrative data, hous ed at the BCCDC, were obtaine d as secondary data through exports from the demonstration project da ta set that contained non-nominal client information and service outcomes (e.g., treatm ent outcomes), as well as exports of non- nominal hepatitis C surveillance data containe d in the public health information system (iPHIS). The researcher di d not access client specific identifiers, to maintain confidentiality of the HCV population studied. The timeframes for administrative data exports were: 1) From the initiation of clie nt services at each site to December 31, 2007 for the demonstration project data set and 2) from 1992 when HCV reportability began to December 31, 2007 for iPHIS. Data from the demonstration project data set were captured pros pectively in a custom database that was used by each project. Sta ndardized data were collected on demographic variables, disease characteristics (co-morbid diseases, genotype, etc.), mode of HCV acquisition (i.e., transmission r oute), and clinical interven tions provided. The duration and nature of clinical interventions, and th e type of the provider, client status and outcomes of therapy were also collected. Me dical parameters, such as liver biopsy or laboratory test values, were not collected. Anonymized data (i.e., without personal identifying information) were exported to th e BCCDC quarterly, and each client record was assigned a unique case number. Algorithms incorporated in the database helped to improve data accuracy by identifying mi ssing and out-of-sequence data, so that corrections could be made at source by each project. Since the implementation of the projects was staged from 2001 through 2004, da ta were grouped by operations year (i.e., PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 37year 1, year 2, etc.) to ensure that comparis ons across projects reflected their years of experience. No partial years we re included in th e analysis. 3.1.3 Partner Survey Subsequent to approvals from relevant ethi cs review boards the nurses at each project developed a list of inter- and in tra-agency partners with whom they had contact within six months. The 216 partners identified (include s the project nurses) were mailed a self- administered survey package between Ma y 30 and June 4, 2007, and a reminder letter June 15 and June 30. As the survey ran into the summer vacation period participants were afforded up to 6 weeks to complete the 20-mi nute survey to allow for interruptions in availability. 3.2 Partner Survey Measures The structure and function of the partners hips was measured using two previously developed instruments: the Integration of Human Services Measure (IHSM) (Browne, Kingston, Grdisa, & Markle-Rei d, 2007; Browne et al., 2004; Browne, Roberts, & Loney, 2007) and the Partnership Self-Assessment Tool (PSAT) (Center for the Advancement of Collaborative Strategies in H ealth, 2006). These tools were developed for descriptive and evaluative purposes. Published information on th eir reliability and validity is summarized in Table 3.1. Although the tools are based on a systems perspective each measures a distinct partnership dimens ion; structure for the IHSM and function for the PSAT. Measurement of both dimensions is necessa ry for the comprehensive description and evaluation of partnerships (Browne et al., 2007; Donabedian, 2005). Both measures are relatively new with reliability and validity evaluations limited to the instrument originators as would be expect ed in area of where a focus on empirical evaluation is just beginning to emerge. Integration of Human Services Measure : The IHSM was developed specifically to list the partners from autonomous organizations th at comprise the partnership and to measure the strength or depth of their linkages. The us er friendly measure al lows for calculation of the strength of the observed (present) and e xpected (desired) linka ges at the individual and group level. Content, face and discrimina te validity are reported by the originators (Browne et al., 2004). This tool is being used in a large scale study tr acking integration in AIDS services organizations in Ontari o (G. Browne, personal communication, June 2006). All identified partner members are listed on the IHSM and the members are asked to rate the observed and expected strength of their linkages with each partner on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from: 0 = No awareness (your service is not aware of the other service); 1 = Awareness (you have knowledge of the other service although no effort is taken to organize activities according to a ny principles except t hose that conform to individual agency/service mi ssions); 2 = Communication (you and the other service have an active program of communication and inform ation sharing); 3 = Cooperation (you and the other service each use your knowledge of the other's servic e to guide and modify your own service planning to obtain a better set of links between services); 4 = Collaboration PhD Thesis - G.

To provide cont extual information two open-ended questions complete the measure: a) What helps you wh en collaborating with other agencies? Why? b) What hinders you from collaborat ing with other agencies? Why? Partnership Self-Assessment Tool : This tool measures the functioning of the partnership, at the level of the group, in terms of the shar ing of perspectives, knowledge and skills. The questionnaire contains 67 ite ms orgnized into 11 domains or categories. Nine categories comprise 5-point Likert scal es and 2 have yes/no dicotomous scales. The responses are summed for each category to provide total category/domain scores. This tool is complementary to but not duplicativ e of the Integration of Human Services Measure as indicated by a weak correlation of r = 0.13 (Brown e et al., 2004). Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) of the six constructs measur ed by scales is adequate (range from 0.83-0.97) (Weiss et al., 2002). A co mplete description and evaluation of the measure was provided earlier in Chapter 2. PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 403.2.1 Partner survey inclusion criteria and participant recruitment The survey aimed to utilize the total popul ation of partners participating in the demonstration projects rather than a select ed or random sample. The convenience sample was composed of the front-line nursing staff at each of the 4 demons tration projects and the partners they nominated as partners in the provision of HCV prevention and care services. The inclusion criteria required partners be able to read English. Those listed were mailed a survey package which contained information on the voluntary nature of participation, the purpose of the study, the measures (IHSM and PSAT) and a self- addressed stamped return envelope (see APPE NDICES ). The survey package contained information on the right to withdraw at any time and details of how their information would be removed from the re cords. All partners were id entified on the IHSM by their agency or service name with the exception of physicians, whose se rvice was associated with their name 3.3 Data Analysis 3.3.1 Data management Qualitative data from electronic versions of historical documents and electronically transcribed data from the two open-ended su rvey questions on the IHSM were housed in an NVivo 7 software folder. Administrative data exported from the de monstration projects was housed in Excel folders. Survey data were double entered by tw o research assistants onto a customized electronic entry form using Access data base software, verified for accuracy, and all discrepancies rectified to reach 100% agreemen t. The verified survey data were then exported to an Excel folder. The following criteria were employed for handling missing survey data: For the PSAT, if a response was missing for half or fewer questions of a subscale (e.g., leadership, satisfaction), the mean of the other questions for that subscale was substituted. If more than ha lf of the responses on a subscale were missing the respondent data were subjected to pair-wise deletion in th e subscale analysis. For the IHSM, scoring criteria were developed through discussion with the originators (Browne, Roberts & Gafni, pe rsonal communication, November, 28, 2008): 1. If a response was missing from either the Observed or Expected column, the missing data point was replaced with the sa me value available in the other column 2. If both Observed and Expected data point s were missing it was interpreted to mean 'no relationship' and the mi ssing data points were repla ced with zero, with a few exceptions that are covered in #3. 3. When a partner was part of a group from a single agency and did not rate the partners from that agency (because the inst ructions stated that the partner should not rate their agency) then a \"4\" replaced the missing data point. The rationale is that if a partner was part of the same agency they worked closely together and were already collaborating. PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 413.3.2 Qualitative Data Analysis Historical documents and responses to the two IHSM open-ended questions were analyzed using thematic analytic technique s (Sandelowski, 2000; Thorne et al., 1997). Thematic analysis requires familiarization with the data by reading and rereading the data sources, coding or organizing the data into themes, and rereading to refine the thematic structure. The software package NVivo 7 was used to facilitate coding and sorting of data into themes. 3.3.3 Quantitative Data Analysis Quantitative data from the survey and the administrative dataset were analysed using Excel, and/or exported to a Statistical P ackage for the Social Sciences (SPSS) or Statistical Analysis Software (SAS \u00ae) as required. Questionnaire items were scored as a single summary score and, where applicable, as composite scores of domains represented by the questionnaire. Analysis in cluded descriptive statistics (counts, means, frequencies, percentages) and inferential stat istics (e.g., correlation, chi-squa re or Fisher's exact test, t- test and ANOVA). Selected data were analysed and displayed on a map of BC using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tech niques and ArcInfo\u00ae version 9.0 software (Environmental Systems Research Institute-E SRI). GIS is a multi-dimensional computer system that is capable of storing, laye ring and analyzing geographically-referenced information. GIS allows the user to view mu ltiple layers of information simultaneously, thereby allowing the user to see complex re lationships between entities such as the partners in this study. The current study used GIS in two ways: 1) to illustrate the geospatial relationships between partners and selected measures of their linkages and; 2) to illustrate the populations affected by hepa titis C and those reached by the projects in their referral areas (surveillan ce data). Surveillance and part ner data were geocoded using postal code and located on a map of the region. All displayed data were imported into the GIS application, ArcInfo\u00ae version 9.0. The da ta files were used by ArcInfo to create base maps of each region. The demonstrati on project sites were used as the central reference point for each regional map. Due to overlapping addresses for data, the true geographic location was slightly altered or disaggregated fo r visual clarity. 3.4 Ethical Considerations/Consent: Ethics approvals were obtained from the University of British Columbia and the revelant institutional review board in each Regional Health Authority. No individuals were identified in the results of this reseach or the dissemination of the findings. The investigator and project res earch assistants had access to the questionnaire responses. Instructions were provided to all members of the research team regarding confidentiality and the proper handling a nd storage of data. In accordance with British Columb ia's FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND PROTECTION OF PRIVACY ACT and the Tr i-Council Policy Statement regarding disclosure and storage of c onfidential information, study docum ents are kept in a locked filing cabinet in the locked o ffice of the writer at BCCDC. All study computer files were password protected. Data will remain secu rely stored for ten years. Electronic PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 42questionnaire data will be erased at the e nd of that time using a program to ensure complete removal of all data. Any paper documents of data will be shredded. All subjects invited to participate in the research will be mailed a summary of the research findings regardless of whether they participated or not. 3.5 Expected Contributions of this study The results will contribute to the refine ment of the conceptual model for IP measurement developed for the study and desc ribed in Chapter 2. A thorough description of the demonstration project services and outcomes may fo ster portability to other geographical areas where care is provided fo r hepatitis C and perhaps to other chronic illnesses. Further benefits associated with this research may derive from knowledge generated that could identify areas where partnerships coul d be strengthened thereby increasing the provision of accessible, a ppropriate, comprehensive, continuous and effective hepatitis C prevention and care. This could lead to an increase in system capacity to provide hepatitis prevention and care. There were no known risks associated with this research. PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 434 RESULTS Since multiple analyses were employed in the study, the results are organized in the following sequence: Section 4.1 describes the development of the f our demonstration projects and the services they provide. Section 4.2 describes the demonstration pr ojects' clinical outcomes as dependent variables with years of operation as an inde pendent variable (administrative data). The clinical outcomes presented are those related to reach. Section 4.3 describes the results of the analysis of the partner survey data from the IHSM and PSAT. To facilitate the analysis of the IHSM and PSAT, their results are organized as follows: Section 4.3.1 describes the results from the thema tic analysis of the re sponse to the open- ended questions on the IHSM. Section 4.3.2 describes the results of the anal ysis of the quantitative data from the IHSM, a measure of the number and type of partners and the strength of their linkages, as a dependent variable, for the four demonstrati on projects. Geographic location and years of operation are independent variables. Section 4.3.3 describes the analysis of the PSA T, a measure of partnership functioning at the level of the group, as a dependent variab le, for the four dem onstration projects. 4.1 Development and program structure of the four demonstration projects This section presents a summary of the anal ysis of historical documents from 2001 to 2007. The review was completed to address th e first study question: How were the four integrated hepatitis C prevention and care proj ects developed and what services do they provide? 4.1.1 How the four integrated prevention and care projects were developed In 2001, HCV knowledge was advancing rapidly, health care providers had difficulty keeping up and misinformation to clients was common. Effective drug therapy for HCV was emerging that could potentially cure some clients and/or improve their liver function. In recognition of the emerging needs associated with HCV as a new di sease, and the fact that 60,000 British Columbians who were inf ected, BC Hepatitis Services (BCHS) was established at the BC Centre for Disease Control to coordinate a multifaceted and integrated approach to rapi dly build provincial capacity for HCV prevention and care services through partnerships. Multiple facets that required coordination were: surveillance for new acute and chronic infectio ns, research (e.g., self care and advocacy), policy development (e.g., practi ce guidelines for diagnosis and laboratory monitoring of response to treatment), hea lthcare professional and consum er education and capacity development for integrated prevention and care se rvices. Initial strategies were targeted at two key but interconnected area s: 1) education of health care professionals, and 2) development of locally accessible integrat ed prevention and care services. These strategies were executed in collaboration with British Columbia's five geographically- PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 44defined regions, termed Regional Health Au thorities (RHA). The RHA are responsible for the provision of health services including public health, acute and long term care. At that time, major health care access point s for those with HCV were public health nurses throughout the RHA and a few specialis t physicians at the provincial tertiary referral centre in Vancouver. Public health nurses receiv ed laboratory reports of all positive HCV tests in their juri sdiction, determined if the results represented new cases, documented new cases into the integrated pub lic health surveillance system (iPHIS) and sent letters to the ordering physicians inform ing them that their c lients and those in the client's social network who were at-risk of HCV infection were eligible to receive hepatitis A and B vaccines free of charge from public health. The provision of vaccines provided public health nurses opportunities to engage those with or at-risk of HCV, gain an understanding of their needs, and provide prevention and health promotion education. Thus public health nurses throughout BC pr ovided an important primary health care access point for those with HCV but thei r services were limited in scope. In order to expand HCV services, BCHS work ed with public health decision-makers in four RHA (Interior Health, Vancouver Is land, Northern Health and Fraser Health Authority) and interested local physicians to develop HCV integrated prevention and care demonstration projects in their jurisdicti ons. To support the educational needs of the health care provider partners in the demons tration projects and others, BCHS worked with the fifth RHA, Vancouver Coastal, to de velop an interdiscipl inary mentorship and training program on Viral Hepatitis. The progr am included clinical mentorships and an annual intensive 3-day interdis ciplinary workshop on viral he patitis prevention and care for participants in the demons tration projects, general and specialist physicians, public health physicians and nurses, Aboriginal community health nurses, nurse clinicians, social workers, advocacy leaders, pharmaceuti cal industry representatives and laboratory scientists. The workshop content was provided by experts from multiple disciplines, using large-group lectures and small-group problem-based discussion sessions. The content included epidemiology and preventi on, liver physiology and histology, laboratory testing, clinical assessment, the experience of living with HCV as a chronic illness, HCV treatment and side effects, and end stage liv er disease. The workshop content is updated annually and registration continues to exceed attendance targets each year. The four integrated prevention and care de monstration projects were established in geographic areas with moderate (81-160 cases per 100,000) to high (>160 cases per 100,000) HCV prevalence rates. Implementatio n was staged over three years starting with Kamloops (155.7/100,000) in Inte rior Health in 2001, Campbell River (182.1/100,000) in Vancouver Isla nd Health, Prince George (122.5/100,000) in Northern Health Authority in 2002, and Surrey (76.6/100,000) in Fraser Health Authority in 2004. In the case of Surrey, although the HCV rate for the city is low, the target region included several areas with high rates (223.9/100,000) housing correctional f acilities as well as an inner city population whose HCV rate could not be calculated separate ly but was reported to be high. PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 45The staging of project implementation fac ilitated a rapid change/quality improvement approach to program design. BCHS facilitate d inter-project comm unications to support knowledge exchange and process improvements. The projects rece ived a $25,000 start-up grant to help defray planning and impl ementation costs and $75,000 in annual funding from BCHS. The projects used their annual funding for dedicated nursing staff and other personnel as displayed in Table 4.1. The projec t nurses were mainly public health nurses with experience in communicable disease prevention. Three projects had two nurses working part-time for a total of .8 full-time equivalents (FTE) while Kamloops had three nurses working part-time for .9 FTE. In Kaml oops, two of the nurses provided clinical services while the third concentrated on community education/development. Both Campbell River and Surrey dedicated .2FTE for me ntal health and addictions services. In Campbell River these services were provided onsit e at the project's clinic while in Surrey the services were provided offsite at a mental health and addictions clinic. Table 4.1: Funding utilization per site Kamloops Campbell River Prince George Surrey 3 PHNs each at .3 FTE .1 FTE Clerical support 1 PHN & 1 hospital outreach nurse each at .4 FTE, 1 mental health & addictions counsellor, .2 FTE In-kind clerical support 2 PHNs each at FTE In-kind clerical support 1Physician session/ month 2 PHNs each at .4 FTE 1 mental health & addictions counsellor, .2 FTE .2 FTE clerical support * PHN= public health nurse * FTE= full time equivalent Some projects, received small grants fr om pharmaceutical industry partners to sponsor community education events and/or purchase additional nursing hours. All other personnel and administrative resources includi ng physical space were provided through in-kind contributions of partners. For ex ample, an administrative database was collaboratively developed together with BCH S to collect information on demographics, risk factors, transmission r outes, diagnostic procedures, clie nt status in the program and treatment outcomes. The database was also de signed to assist the nurses in monitoring complex hepatitis C treatment regimes, ensure laboratory testing pr otocols were followed and document the client's progress. BCHS admi nisters the database and receives monthly non-nominal data from each site to co mpile statistics and produce reports. BCHS brings the project nurses and their ma nagers together yearly to exchange lessons learned and plan the following year's objectives. In 2004, BCHS funded a qualitative project review (Butt, Barichell o, Trustham, & Hill, 2004) which described the projects' progress, accomplishments, lessons learned and made recommendations for future directions. In 2007, BCHS analysed the treatment outcomes of all those who PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 46received antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon a nd ribavirin and found outcomes which were comparable to clin ical trials (Hill et al., 2008). 4.1.2 Services provided by the four projects Although each project developed their ow n program, the commonalities are striking. The common theme within their goal statements was to enhance the capacity of individuals, communities, and health and social service agencies to prevent and manage hepatitis C using partnerships and the a ddition of dedicated nursing resources. The services at each location comprised indivi dual client services as well as community development/ education. To facilitate easy access to client services and maintain confidentiality of diagnosis each project established a 'liver clinic'. Kamloops, Prince George and Surrey each established their c linic in a public health unit while Campbell River located their clinic in the hospital outpatient area. The individual-based clinical services were developed and provided by the project nurses in collaboration with the physician specialists and other agency/professional partners. Clients accessed serv ices through self or physician referral. The project nurses worked within an expanded scope of practice providing comprehensive client assessments and follow-up, client/family e ducation, intensive monitoring and support during antiviral therapy and palliation. Nurse assessments and interventions were instigated prior to medical c onsultations to assist the cl ients to learn about HCV and important aspects of self-management, stabil ize their life s ituation, initia te lifestyle changes, and/or prepare for the psychological and physical si de effects of antiviral drug therapy. Some clients with end stage liver disease were unable to undergo therapy, but required close monitoring and support as they awaited transplantati on or other tertiary care services. For clients on treatment the nurses provided traini ng in self-injection, monitored their response to antiviral thera py through clinical obser vation and laboratory tests, managed side effects and adjusted drug dosages in consultation with physicians, and supported client adherence to the manageme nt plan. Nurse services were provided by phone and in person at the project's clinic si te. The nurses worked closely with referring physicians and the physician consultants, who vi sited the project sites two to four times a month to provide HCV medical consultations and determine which clients to start on treatment. Physician consultants also worked collaboratively with th e nurses to develop and update their clinic protoc ols especially those used to assist the nurses with monitoring clients during their six to twelve month complex antiviral therapy regimes. Physician consultants varied by site and included specialists in gastroenterology, internal medicine, infectious disease and a gene ral practitioner experienced in HCV and addictions medicine. In addi tion to physician consultations, the nurses linked clients with other health professionals or ancillary services and coordina ted care in order to assist clients in meeting their multiple and complex needs. For example, individuals were referred to housing agencies to stabilize thei r living arrangemen ts, public health communicable disease clinics for immuniza tions (hepatitis A, B, pneumonia and influenza), or mental health and addic tions counsellors for behaviour therapy. PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 474.1.3 Community-based awareness/education The project nurses worked with a variety of partners to build community awareness and knowledge of HCV. Community awarene ss and education of HCV was accomplished through educational presentations to health and social service providers, staff in addictions support agencies, re sidents and/or staff in corr ectional facilities, advocacy groups, and the public. For example, in one si te the nurses developed a skit to present HCV health promotion and prevention messages that were well received in a variety of cultural contexts, age groups and educational backgrounds. Public health was a key partner in commun ity-based projects due to their experience in partnership work and community developm ent. For example, a public health partner with expertise in Geographic Informa tion Systems (GIS) mapped socio-economic indicators associated with vul nerability to HCV and other de mographic data to determine areas of the city where vulnerable populati ons lived. This information was subsequently used strategically to plan the content and location for educational activities. In one site, a project nurse partnered w ith local businesses, law enforcement and municipal government officials to devel op a community-owned harm reduction program. As part of the program, an education campa ign taught citizens how to safely pick up discarded needles and syringes in parks a nd downtown areas. To improve child safety, the campaign included development of pamphlet s and posters to teach children to alert adults when they found discarded needles and syringes. The program included placement of needle deposit boxes in affected parks a nd training of local me rchants and municipal workers in the safe removal and replacement of the needle deposit boxes. Thus, while the nurse facilitated the project the co mmunity owned and maintained it. Summary: Four integrated prevention and care de monstration projects were initiated in small urban/rural areas between 2001 and 2004 to meet the needs of those with HCV and improve local access and capacity. The projec ts were initiated through partnerships, sharing of resources and the expansion of nursing services. The project nurses extended the partnerships through the provision of individual cl inical and community-based services. Although the projects started at differe nt times and are located in geographically distinct regions they have common goals and provide similar services with some local variations. Each project has a clinic site where client se rvices are provided by project nurses in close partnership with visiting c onsultant physicians. Campbell River is the only project with a visiting ment al health and addictions co unsellor. Other professional services are obtained through referrals coordinated by the project nurses. 4.2 Demonstration Projects Outcomes and Administrative Data Results This section addresses the second study question: Is there a difference among the demonstration projects and the outcomes wh ich are related to population reach when compared by year of operation? The clinical outcomes of the demonstration projects are viewed as dependent variables with years of operation as an inde pendent variable. The clinical indicators selected ar e those related to two study assu mptions: 1) use of services reflects the need for services and, 2) integrat ion of services increas es population reach. PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 48The administrative database contained information of 2651 clients; however, 139 clients were removed prior to analysis ( 118 referrals after operational year cutoff, 10 referrals prior to project initiation, and 11 c lients with no referral date). The remaining 2512 client records from 2001 to 2007 were grou ped and analyzed by operations year for a total of 20 years of operations (i.e., Kamloops 6yrs., Campbell River 5yrs., Prince George 5yrs., and Surrey 4 yrs). Table 4.2 pr ovides a summary of the number of clients referred to each project, demographics, diseas e characteristics, and referrals to other services on intake. The largest number of referra ls occurred in Year 1 for all projects and declined slowly thereafter. Most clients (72% ) were in the 40-59 age groups; the majority were White (83%) or Aboriginal (11%). The second most frequent ethnicity varied by project; Surrey had 18 % East Indian clie nts, Prince George, Campbell River and Kamloops had 21%, 13%, and 7% Aboriginal clients respectively. On referral, 40% of clients were married, only 40% were employed full or part -time and large proportions were on disability (18%) or not employed ( 19%). The overall propor tion of clients at each project who were on disability or not employed was: Kamloops 36%, Prince George 33%, Campbell 31%. Of the 8% of HCV clients with a secondary diagnosis, 46% had advanced liver disease (e .g., cirrhosis, liver can cer, and end-stage liver disease), 23% had diabetes and 16% were co-infected with HIV. Of the 92 clients reported to have advanced liver disease Ca mpbell River had the greatest proportion (n= 48, 65%). The majority of clients had HCV genotype 1, (65%). Approximately 10% (248/2512) of referred clients (or 13% of a ssessed clients) were referred to other services after their first visit. Mental health and addictions accounted for th e majority (87.1%) of these referrals. Eighty-two percent of the 216 referrals to ment al health and addictions originated in Campbell River, where a mental health and addictions professional visited the project clinic to provided onsite serv ices. Although the Surrey project dedicated funding for mental health and addictions services similar to Campbell River they accounted for only 8% of the 216 referrals. Su rrey referrals were identical to Kamloops where no funding was dedicated to mental health and addictions resources. The disparity in referral rates may be related to accessibi lity (i.e., client reluctance to engage with unfamiliar staff in an unfamiliar location). There was slight variation in the proportion of referred cl ients who attended for clinic services: 72% Prince George, 74%, Kamloops and Surrey, and 80% Campbell River. Clinic visits could consist of either a nurse assessment , physician consultation or both. Table 4.3 reveals that most cl ients received both with some variation between projects but little variation by operations year. Inte restingly, 21-43% of clie nts received services exclusively from the nurse. Mean times from referral to first assessment were calculated for all clients and two client sub-groups: those who received anti-vir al therapy and those who received only education and support. A surprising observati on for each year of operation was a shorter mean time from referral to first clinic visit for clients who received antiviral therapy than those who received solely educati on/support as shown in Table 4.4.

Excluded from the analysis were 615 referred clients who never attended th e clinics, 27 clients whose assessment date occurred before the referral data and 41 clie nts who delayed their initial visit beyond 360 days. Using ANOVA there was a significant diffe rence, p= < .001, in wait times between projects, and the Tukey a identified wait times for Prince George, M=35 days, were significantly shorter than for Campbell Rive r, M= 48 days, or Kamloops, M= 50 days, when all years of operation were considered. In order to account for the variation in years of operation among the projects, the analysis was repeated to include only years for which all four projects had comparable data (years 2, 3 and 4). Year 1, the start up year, was excluded as the projects had wide vari ation in the amount and type of nursing resources and a pent up need for services. Ye ars 5 and 6 were exclude d as not all projects were operational in those year s. Data analyzed on 996 eligib le clients revealed similar pattern of significant differences between the projects p= < .001, with wait times for Prince George, M=37 days, significantly shorter than for Campbell River, M= 52 days, or Kamloops, M= 56 days, when these three years of operation were considered. To further explore differences between proj ects, separate analyses were completed for years 2, 3 and 4 for each project. For Year 2, wait times for Prince George, M=37 days, and Kamloops, M= 44 days were significantly shorter than Ca mpbell River, M= 65 days. In Year 3, wait PhD Thesis - G.

In Year 4, wait times for Prince George, M=28 days were significantly shorter than Kamloops M=65 da ys. Overall, when the projects were compared by years of operation, Prince George consistently evidenced shorter mean wait times. Significantly longer wait times occu rred in Campbell River and Kamloops. The significant difference in Campbell River mean wait times occurred in Year 2, in contrast to Kamloops where significant differences occurred in both Years 3 and 4. To explore differences within projects sim ilar analyses were completed for Years 2, 3 and 4 for each project. Campbell River had si gnificantly longer mean times from referral to first visit in Year 2 (M=65 days) than Year 3 (M=38 days) or Year 4 (M=46 days). Surrey also had significantly longer mean time s from referral to first visit in Year 2 (M=64 days) than Year 3 (M=34 days) or Y ear 4 (M=44 days). While Kamloops had the opposite experience with a signi ficantly shorter mean tim es for Year 2 (44 days) compared only to Year 4 (M=65 days) and Pr ince George had no significant differences p=0.15 in mean times. Overall, Prince George had the most consistent mean wait times from referral to first visit for Years 2, 3 and 4. Campbell River and Surrey have experienced a reduction in the mean times, while Kamloops has experienced an increase. There is variation between and within the f our projects in the mean time from referral to first visit. Prince George has the shortest mean wait times and the least variation by comparable operations years. The differences may be related to differences in referral volumes, client populations and fluctuations in availability of project nursing staff due to extended absences and staff changes that requi re service reductions during the intensive orientation and training period. On discussion of the variations in wait times at a recent meeting, the project nurses (personal comm unication, March, 06, 2009) reported that they adjust appointments based on cl ient preferences and urgency so that clients can have ready access to services. For example, client s who received anti-viral therapy may have been more motivated to access services a nd this could account for their shorter wait times. Table 4.5 provides a summary of treatment end-points and therapy outcomes (non- responder or responder) for clients with ge notype 1 and genotype non-type 1. Treatment end-points were: adverse events, no EVR ( early virological response at week 12, genotype 1 only), patient choice (not due to adverse events), and course of therapy completed. The majority (76%) of those ini tiating therapy completed the full course of therapy. However, for genotype 1, which re quires 48 weeks of therapy, 65% of clients completed therapy. For genotype non-type 1, a 24-week course of therapy, 87% of clients completed therapy. Adverse events accounted for 12 % of the overall stopping reasons and this also was higher in genotype 1 (15%) vs. genotype non-type 1 (9%). For genotype 1, EVR was evaluated at week 12 to identify clients for whom further therapy was futile (18%). Overall, 62% of those who entered therapy obtained a sustained virological response (SVR). The response ra te for genotype 1 clie nts was 48%, and for genotype non-type 1, 78%. Response rates calcul ated for each of the four projects for a subset of clients (operations years 2 and 3) and reported in Table 4.6 reveal wide variation in response rates between projects es pecially for genotype 1 clients (max 69%, PhD Thesis - G.

As the number of treated clients is small these di fferences may be related to variation in the population. Although there was no standardized method fo r recording cause of death, projects endeavoured to obtain the cause of death and annotate the client's record. Death was recorded for 58/2512 (2%) clients (Table 4.7). Liver disease was the most commonly observed cause of death (33%), followed by unknown causes (26%), heart disease (10%), and suicide (9%). To calculate population r each, the community of origin was recorded in the administrative database for each refe rral, as well as the number of hepatitis C antibody positive individuals reported in each community in iPHIS. Population reach was therefore calculated as the number of i ndividuals referred divided by the number of reported HCV cases and expressed as a percen tage. To simplify analysis, cases whose origins were from metropolitan areas of the province (e.g.,Vancouver, Victoria, etc.) that were not serviced by the project sites were excluded from the analysis and cases where the total number of clients referred to the clinic was less than three. A GIS map was produced showing the percentage population reach in the ge ographic area (Figure 4.1). PhD Thesis - G.

At these sites, the map demonstrates extensive reach into rural and remote locations, one of the main object ives of the projects. When po pulation reach is calculated by individual communities within a project site's catchment area, there are a few communities that have had over 50% of reported cases referred for assessment. In contrast, the Surrey location reac hed 2% of all reported cases. However, it must be noted PhD Thesis - G.

Table 4.8 shows the number and proporti on of clients referred from the community in which the project clinics are located. The table shows that Kamloops, Prince George and Campbell River begin their operati ons with a high proportion of clients that reside in the project clinic community. These proportions decline over time, indicating increasing reach over time to more remote communities, as illustrated in the GIS maps (Figure 4.1). This pattern is reversed in Surrey, where th e proportion of clients residing in Surrey increases over time, likely related to th eir project's goal to focus on inner-city populations. Table 4.8: Number and proportion of refe rred clients living in the project site community by year of operations . Summary: The administrative data analysis reveal ed that all four pr ojects were being accessed by the target population, individuals wi th hepatitis C. The projects had similar patterns of referrals with the greatest number of referrals in the first year of operation suggesting a pent up demand for services. Alth ough the Prince George project had shorter wait times from referral to assessment than Campbell River and Kamloops, all projects had a gap in uptake of servi ces in that 20-28% of thos e referred did not attend for services. Population reach measures were also similar for three of the four projects, (i.e. Prince George, Campbell River and Kamloops). The geographic catchment and population base for Surrey was much larger than the other projects resulting in a significantly smaller proportion reached. This may reflect a shortcoming of applying this method of calculating population reach in ur ban regions where special populations are targeted but are also difficult to quantify.

The IHSM, a measure of structure, contained qualitative and quantitative data while the PSAT, a measure of group functioning, contained only qu antitative data. Data from the IHSM were analysed to address the third study ques tion: Is there a differe nce in the structure (number, type of the partners and the extent/d epth of their linkages) in each of the four demonstration projects? The PSAT data were analysed to deal with the fourth question: Is there a difference in measures of partnershi p functioning in each of four demonstration projects? Finally, rela tionships between the IHSM and PSAT data were examined in response to question five: Is there a relati onship among the demonstration projects and the variables structure, func tion and years of operation? 4.3.1 Survey results for the quantitative data from the IHSM This section contains the results from the analysis of the quantitative data from the IHSM, a measure of the number and type of partners and the depth or extent of their linkages, as a dependent variable, for th e four demonstration projects. Geographic location and years of operation of the pr ojects are independent variables. The objective of the analysis was to describe : 1) the characteristics (number, type and location) of the partners at each of the four sites, 2) the de pth or extent of the linkages between the project nurses and their partners and finally, 3) the depth of the linkages amongst all the partners as a group. The depth of linkages was determined using partner ratings on a scale where no li nkage, was indicated by 0=no aw areness, and a linkage was indicated on an increasing de pth of involvement scale of 1-4, where 1= awareness; 2=communication; interpreta tion were guided by three study assumptions: 1) The number and type of partners is cont ext specific; 2) The num ber and diversity of partners will be larger in de monstration projects that have been in operation for greater lengths of time; 3) Partnerships will extend beyond the geographic re ferral area served by the demonstration project, and 4) Less di fference or greater co ngruence between the expected minus the observed scores on the IHSM indicates partners achieved what they expected. 1) Characteristics of the partners at each of the four sites Assumption-based characteristics investig ated included the number and type of service providers and the relationship to local context, including the years of operation of the project, and the geographic dispersion of the partners. Prior to the partner surve y, the nurses at each of th e four projects provided information on their partners including the num ber of partners, the service/agency name and their location. The number of partners at each project ranged from 29-68 as summarized in Table 4.9. The three projects operational for >5 years had the greatest number and diversity of part ners. The partners represente d a broad range of services/ PhD Thesis - G.

Butt McMaster - Nursing 64 from the sites within the particular project's RHA as well as within other RHAs. Partners located beyond each project's RHA were ma inly partners in common between the projects including the nurses at the four projects and agencies with provincial or national scope. The distribution of the 216 part ners within the four partne r categories is displayed in Figure 4.6. Since the population focus of the cl inics was on those already infected with hepatitis C, it was not unexpected that health services comprised the majority of partners (41% to 73%) at each of the four projects. To understand the configura tions at each of the projects, Fisher's exact test was used. Ther e were significant differences in the proportion of partners classified as Health Services p=0.018 and Pub lic Health p=0.014. Pair-wise testing revealed a significantly higher proporti on of Public Health partners in Surrey (7/29=24%) than both Kamloops (5/68=7%), p= 0.04, and Campbell River (4/68=6%) p=0.02. Prince George also had a higher proportion of public health partners (10/51=20%) than Campbell River (4/68=6%), p=0.04. In contrast, Campbell River had a significantly greater proporti on of Health Services part ners (50/68=74%) than Surrey (12/29=41%), p=0.005. This was the only differe nce between the projects that remained significant, p=0.03 when the results were ad justed for multiple comparisons with the Bonferroni correction.

Butt McMaster - Nursing 65These results indicate that although the number of partners varies, each project has a similar proportion of partners within the f our partner categories with one exception. The proportion of health services pa rtners was significantly great er in Campbell River than Surrey. One possible contextual reason for this observed difference is that Surrey's client population, an inner-city vul nerable population, is tradit ionally focused on by public health leading to more interactions and part nerships with public health staff than with health services staff. Another possible expl anation is that Campbe ll River's program was situated in a hospital and one of the project nurses also wo rked in diabetes outreach, placing them in more direct contact with health services pers onnel. In addition, Campbell River had a high proportion of clie nts with advanced liver disease likely requiring more health services linkages. On completion of the survey, response rate s were calculated for each questionnaire in the survey package and reported separately in the results section. The IHSM had the highest response rate of the two questionna ires. The response rate was (96/216, 44%) and distributed as follows: Surrey (1 2/29, 41%). The proportion of survey respondents compared to the non-respondents in each partner category was examined to see if there were differences in the repres entation at each of the four projects. The distribution of respondents and non-respondent s are displayed in Table 4.10 and Figure 4.7. Each project had 40% or hi gher response rates in all pa rtner categories, with the following exceptions: health services respons e rates were 30% in Kamloops and 17% in Surrey and ancillary services response rate s were 37% in Kamloops, 20% in Campbell River and 17% in Surrey. Tests for statisti cal significance were not conducted due to the fact that some partner cate gories had a small number of me mbers and there were a small number of respondent partners in some sites (e.g., Surrey). Overall, the perspectives of each partner category are represented in all four projects. As expected, the highest participation rates were among the Integrated H ealth Services and Public Health partners, since this group was comprised of the project nurses.

During th e historical review it was ev ident that the project nurses were instrumental in developing interprofession al relationships. It fo llows then that each partner would, at a minimum, have some leve l of involvement or li nkage with a project nurse. Measurement of individual relationshi ps was not considered a priori in the methods section. However, the IHSM provides a mechanism for each partner to rate their relationship with every other pa rtner so it was possible to isol ate these particular ratings and examine the depth of each nurse-partner linkage for all respondents (i.e., how the nurse and the partner rated each other). Tables 4.11 to 4.14 summarize the projec t nurse and corresponding respondent partner ratings from each project. The ratings include: 1) observed (i.e., their observed depth of involvement), 2) expected (i.e., what they perceived their depth of involvement should be) and, 3) the difference between the expected minus observed ratings. The nurse's ratings of respondent pa rtners at each of the four projects indicate d a level of interaction from '1' to '4' on the IHSM scale fo r all partners with th e exception of three PhD Thesis - G.

Butt McMaster - Nursing 71partners in Kamloops who were rated as '0 ' indicating no interac tion. Since the project nurses developed the list, a '0' rating was une xpected. This rating was likely due to staff changes between the time the partner list was developed and completion of the questionnaire. The nurse who completed the questionnaire was new to the group and had not yet developed relationships with all th e partners (M.Triggs, personal communication, June 30, 2007). The corresponding respondent partner ratings of project nurses at each of the four projects showed a similar level of interacti on from '1' to '4' on the IHSM scale with the exception of seven partners in Kamloops and two in Campbell River who indicated '0', (i.e., no interaction). These tw o projects had the greatest numb er of partners (68 each). Possible explanations for the \"no interaction\" rating include: the partner was new to the project or the person comple ting the questionnaire was not the person at the agency familiar with the project. In Kamloops, indi vidual-based clinical and community-based services were separated, each with its own dedicated nursing staff. Although the project nurses submitted a composite partner list it is possible that they each had partners who were unique to their service. Combining th e partners as one group may have caused confusion that is reflec ted in the \"0\" ratings. To determine if significant differences exis ted between the project nurse's ratings and corresponding partner observed and expected ratings, paired t-tests were performed using non parametric procedures with the Wilcoxon Signed Ranke d Test. This technique showed no significant difference except for the 'observed' ratings in one project, Prince George, where the median nurse-to-partner ' observed' rating of '3 ' was 1-point higher than the partner-to-nurse median rating of '2' (p=0.022). Overall, th ese results indicate a high level of agreement between the nurse and partner ratings of thei r partnership (Table 4.15). The difference between the observed and exp ected ratings of the project nurses and their partners was calculated to gain insight into whether there were expectations for change in the relationships. Table 4.16 and Table 4.17 contain the percentage frequencies for all paired data. The differences rangi ng from zero to a 1-point difference were assumed to indicate that there is no perceived need for change. In contrast, differences greater than 1-point were assumed to mean change was desired. Overall, the project nurses most frequently rated \"no change\" (0 to 1-point difference) 88% to 100% of the time, while the corresponding project partner rated no change 89% to 100% of the time. This indicates that the depth of nurse-partner involvement is expected to remain stable at the observed, or present, level of involvement. 3) Analysis of the observed and expected ratings of Respondent Pa rtners for all other partners (aggregated to the level of the group). Having examined the nurse-to-partner ratings, it is important to explore whether and to what extent the partner-to-partner li nkages extended beyond the project nurses to include other partners. According to the c onceptual model, even though the partners initially interacted with the project nurse, eventually through fr equent communication PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 72Table 4.15: Paired t-test for Project Nurse rating vs. Partner's rating Variables: Nurse to Partner vs Partner to Nurse Kamloops Prince George Campbell River Project nurses ratings for chan ge in respondent partners involvement Table 4.17: Respondent partners ratings fo r change in project nurses involvement and feedback loops the various partners w ould become interconnected thus forming a virtual group. As the project nurses and part ners did not have a formal mechanism for meeting as a composite group, it was important to confirm if inter-p artner relationships existed and to examine the depth of involvement. Measurement of the depth of inter- partner involvement was the primary target of the planned analysis of IHSM data. The data were examined from two rating perspectives called \"self\" and \"group\". \"Self\" ratings included the sum of all ratings given by a respondent partner for all listed partners. \"Group\" ratings included the sum of all ratings provided for each partner, whether or not they were a respondent partner. These ratings were expressed as averages (means). To understand how each partner viewed th eir linkages (i.e., the depth of their involvement with every other partner), mean 'self' ratings were calculated for each partner (i.e., the sum of the ratings given by the particular partner for all other partners divided by the total number of pa rtners). To elucidate the pe rceived depth of involvement ascribed to a partner by all ot her partners, mean 'group' ra tings for each partner were calculated (i.e., the sum of th e ratings given by the other partners for the respective Kamloops Prince George Campbell River Surrey '0' no change 15 (63%) 14 (54%) (100%) 31 (100%) 11 (100%)Difference between (EXP & OBS) ratings Project SiteKamloops Prince George Campbell River Surrey '0' no change 16 (67%) 12 (46%) (100%) 31 (100%) 11 (100%)Difference between (EXP & OBS) ratings Project Site PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 73partner divided by the total number of partners ). To simplify presentation of the data, mean scores were calculated for 'self' and 'group' ratings within each of the four partner categories in order to display a category score and a composite sc ore (grand total). The mean, standard deviation, and median for the depth of self and group observed and expected linkages at each of the four projects within th e preceding categories are displayed in Table 4.18 'self' and Table 4.19 'group'. The category means for the depth of observed linkages range from < 1 to 2.0 'sel f' and 'group' < 1 to 2.4 and the means for expected linkages range from 1.1 to 3.5 'self' and <1 to 2.7 'group'. Overall, the partner groups at each of the four projects rated 'e xpected' higher than 'obs erved' indicating an expectation to increase the depth of their li nkages within the composite group as well as within each of the four pa rtner categories. Table 4.18 a nd Table 4.19 contain a summary of the differences between the mean observed and expected scores for each of the four partner categories. The display shows Ca mpbell River and Kamloops with the most congruence or least difference (0.4) between the total mean observed and expected ratings indicating little expectation for change. The mean differences between the projects were compared using ANOVA to determine if differences were statistically significant. The results summarized in Table 4.20 reveal significant differences on all but one of the partner rati ng variables (i.e., the mean difference between projects on 'self' expected minus observed ratings). To determine the source of significant variance , Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons were calculated for the four projects on all statistically-significant variables revealing the following: Observed self ratings for both Surrey (M= 1.5, SD .63) and Campbell River (M= 1.3, SD.63) were significantly higher, p= .01 a nd .043 respectively, than for Kamloops (M= .91, SD.39). Expected self ratings for Surre y (M=2.13, SD .7) were significantly higher (p=.003) than for Kamloops (M =1.28, SD .56). Observed group ratings for both Surrey (M= 1.5, SD .78) and Campbell River (M= 1.3, SD .48) were significantly higher p= <.001 (for both) than Kamloops (M= .90, SD.41). Surrey ratings were also significan tly higher (p<.001) than those for Prince George (M= 1.08, SD .29). The expected group rating for Surrey (M= 2.14, SD .62), Campbell River, (M= 1.65, SD .51), and Prince George (M= 1.58, SD .4), was significantly higher Surrey ratings were also significantl y higher, than those for Campbell River (p= <.001) and Prince George (p= <.001). Mean difference between the observed a nd expected group ratings for Surrey (M= .62, SD .25) were significantly higher than for Campbell River (M= .35, SD .17, p= < .001), Kamloops (M= .37, SD .18, p=<.001) and Prince George (M= .49, SD .18, p= .023), while ratings for Prince George were si gnificantly higher than Campbell River (p= .0002) or Kamloops (p=.003).

Butt McMaster - Nursing 76Table 4.20: Comparison of total mean se lf and group ratings at four projects The analysis reveals that Surrey, the youngest project, operational for four years, had partner ratings of involvement that were c onsistently higher than those of Kamloops, the oldest project operational for six years, on al l 'self' and 'group' ratings. There were no differences on Surrey 'self' ratings compared to Prince George and Campbell River. However, Surrey 'group' ratings for observed or current involvement were significantly higher than those for Prince George while 'g roup' expected and the difference between 'group' expected minus observed ratings were higher than those of Campbell River and Prince George. Kamloops, had consistently lower depth of i nvolvement scores compared to the other projects and the least expecta tion for change (i.e., increa sed partner involvement). The two projects operational for 5 years, Campbe ll River and Prince George, had intermediate results. Similar to Surrey, Campbell River pa rtners indicated greater partner involvement and an expectation for change on expected minus observed scores compared to Kamloops. However, the differences between expected minus observed ratings indicated a much greater expectation for change in Surre y than Campbell River. In contrast, Prince George results were similar to Surrey in that the difference between observed and expected ratings indicated an expectation for change or greater involvement compared to Kamloops and Campbell River. Overall these results point to the greatest pa rtner expectations for change or increased involvement are in Surrey, followed by Ca mpbell River and Prince George. Kamloops project partners indicate little expectation for change in th eir depth of involvement. The Surrey results (higher ratings and expectations for change) may be related to the younger age of the Surrey project and a need for pa rtners who focus on vulnerable inner city populations to work more closely together. As the above results included self and group ratings for part ners whether or not they responded to the survey, it was necessary to examine whether there was any consistency in the ratings given for respondents vs. non-resp ondents. Paired t-tests were run for each ANOVA results for 'Self' Ratings (3 degrees of freedom, n= 92, = .05) Rating F p Observed 4.51 .005 Expected 4.48 .006 Difference observed- expected 1.56 .205 ANOVA results for 'Group' Ratings (3 degrees of freedom, n= 212, = observed-expected 18.58 PhD Thesis - G.

Analysis in cluded the mean differences for observed, expected and the differences between expect ed minus observed rati ngs. Partners did not know if a particular listed pa rtner responded to the survey an d were therefore blinded to the respondent status. The results summarized in Table 4.21 indicate that mean self ratings for responders were significantly high er than scores for non-responders for both 'observed' and 'expected' ra tings in Surrey (p=.01, .007) and Campbell River (p<.001, .001) but not in Kamloops or Prince George . The differences between observed minus expected self ratings was si gnificantly higher for responders vs. non-responders only for Prince George (p=.04) and Kamloops (p=.02). Th e t-test results comparing differences in the mean group ratings of respondents vs. non-respondents are summarized in (Table 4.22) and show a reversed effect. The Campbe ll River non-respondent mean scores were Table 4.21: Differences on Self Rating s for Respondents vs. Non Respondents Observed Differences Expected Differences Difference of expected - observed M SD t p M SD t p M SD t p Surrey (n= 12) .52 .58 3.11 .01* 32) .44 .53 4.68 <.001* .46 .49 5.28 <.001* .02 .17 .58 .57 (n= 25) -.11 .36 -1.5 .15 -.02 .4 .19 2.45 .02* PG (n= 27) .03 .26 -.54 .59 .08 .33 1.24 .23 .11 .25 2.22 .04* * p<.05 Table 4.22: Differences on Group Rating s for Respondents vs. Non Respondents Observed Differences Expected Differences Difference of expected - observed M SD t p M SD t p M SD t p Surrey (n= 29 ) -.52 .75 -1.83 .78 .11 .3 .02 .47 .13 -.09 .17 -2.12 .04* PG -.11 .18 -2.14 .04* * p<.05 PhD Thesis - G.

Surre y non-respondent mean scores were significantly higher than respondent mean scores only for e xpected ratings. Kamloops and Prince George ratings were statistically significant only fo r the mean difference between expected minus observed ratings, which were significantly higher for non- respondents p=.04 and p=.04, respectively. The t-test results were equivocal. On self measures, (i.e., how res pondent partners rated their relationship with other all partners ), partner responders in Surrey and Campbell River rated a greater current and expected depth of invol vement with other partner responders than with non-responder partne rs. Although on the preceding measures the relationship did not hold for Prince Geor ge and Kamloops, the difference between expected minus observed involvement was hi gher for responders than non-responders. However, on group measures, (i.e., how a pa rticular partner was rated by all other respondent partners), the oppos ite relationship (non-responder involvement greater than responder) was observed for Campbell River on both observed and expected measures and only on expected measures for Surrey. Th is reversal was also evident for Prince George and Kamloops, in that the differ ence between expected minus observed involvement was higher for non -responders than responders. In summary, the results of the analysis of th e IHSM data indicate that each project has a similar structure with partners represented in each of the four partner categories albeit in slightly different proporti ons. There are differences in th e number of partners and the depth of partner involvement at each of the four projects. The greatest partner expectations for change or increased invol vement are in Surrey, followed by Campbell River and Prince George. Kamloops project part ners indicate little e xpectation for change in their depth of involvement. 4.3.2 Survey results of the themat ic analysis of the IHSM There were 81/96 responses to the questions 'what helps you when collaborating with other agencies? Why?' and 'what hinders you from collaborating with other agencies? Why?' The analysis revealed that for the mo st part the responses to 'what enhances collaboration' had a matching negative corollar y within the 'what hi nders collaboration' responses. For example, sharing client in formation was an enhancing factor while refusing to share client information was a hindering factor. Three major thematic categories emerged during the analysis: awareness or willingness to collaborate, interdependenc y and relationship building. Agreement or willingness to collaborate stressed that this was a necessary if not determining feature for partners to be able to work together. Interdependency was f acilitated through common organizational and professional values and a culture that supports permeable boundaries between agencies. Permeable boundaries were co nsidered crucial to facilitate access to the desired professionals, sharing of inform ation and client management. Building and maintaining collegial relations hips was associated with the use of various methods to create and sustain communication, having adequate resources such as time to dedicate to learning about other partners a nd their services and fosteri ng these linkages, leadership PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 79by front-line staff, and support from manageme nt. These themes are consistent with the conceptual model for front-lin e interprofessional partnerships presented in Chapter 2. 4.3.3 Survey results from the PSAT The section contains the analyses of the PSAT, a measure of partnership functioning at the level of the group, as a dependent vari able, for the four demonstration projects (partnership survey). Partners hip functioning in this case re lates to how well each partner interacts with every other partner as a gr oup. Of the 96 survey packages returned, 82 contained completed PSAT questionnaires result ing in an 82/216= 41% response rate. All available data in the 82 questionnaires were incl uded in the analysis. It is interesting that 82/96= 85% of respondent partne rs (who were in an informal relationship and had never met as a composite group) conceptualized themselves functioning as a group as evidenced by completion of the PSAT and hypot hesized in this study's conceptual model presented in chapter 2. Results (Table 4.23) describe each project 's ratings on fifty PSAT items, measured on a 5-point Likert scale, su mmarized by domain including : mean ratings, standard deviation, number eligible for analysis, a nd number of scale items. Overall, the mean ratings ranged from 2.9 to 4.2 out of 5, the mode rate and higher ranges of the scale. The range of mean ratings varied between th e projects as follows: Kamloops 3.0-4.2, Prince George 2.9-3.8, Campbell River 3.0-4.2 and Surr ey 2.9 to 4.2. To determine if the variation was statistically si gnificant between-site, comparis ons of mean ratings on each domain were completed using ANOVA (par ametric) and Kruskal-Wallis tests (non- parametric). These analyses revealed no significant differences between sites.

Group functioning scores on the synergy and related domains of the PSAT ranged from moderate to moderately high. Between project comparisons indicated th e projects had similar levels of group functioning. 4.3.4 Correlation of the IHSM and the PSAT Comparison of the IHSM and PSAT scores was necessary to explore the assumption that higher scores on the IHSM will have a positive correlation to higher scores on the PSAT particularly within the synergy domai n. The analysis focused on the correlation between the partner self ratings of the depth of their involvement with other partners on the IHSM and partnership functioning as measured by nine domains (synergy and associated domains) of the PSAT usi ng Spearman's correlation coefficient (r s). The results indicate signif icant positive correlations for Campbell River and Surrey on several domains. For Campbell River, sign ificant moderate positive correlations (0.4- 0.7) between the depth of obs erved linkages and Synergy r s(27)=.41, p=.03; Effectiveness rs(22)=.44, p=.04; Making r s(27)=.57, p=.002. For Surrey, significant moderate (0.4- 0.7) to high (>0.7) positive correlations were found for the following PSA T domains: Leadership r s(11)=.81, p=.002; Effectiveness r s(11)=.77, and Benefits rs(11)=.72, p=.01. Positive correlations on several of the PSAT domains were observed in the two projects that had the highest mean scores on the IHSM (i.e., Campbell River and Surrey). Campbell River positive correlations include d synergy and three associated domains while Surrey had positive correlations with four synergy associated domains. The high levels of correlation between the two measur es indicate that the instruments are likely PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 81 measuring conceptually related facets of partnership. For exam ple, in Surrey, high scores on the Leadership and Effectiveness domains about quality of func tioning correlated with high scores with IHSM depth of collaborati on scores. This denotes a relationship between the facets of partnership measured in those domains and the concepts of cooperation and collaboration used to indicate stronger dept h of involvement on the IHSM. These results provide support for the assumption that highe r scores on the IHSM will have a positive correlation to higher scores on the PSAT. 4.4 Results Summary and Interpretation This section brings together the qualitativ e and quantitative st udy data. It addresses the study purpose and final study question by describing the relationship among the demonstration projects and the variables structure, function, years of operation and population reach? Relationships are identifie d through a review of the commonalities and differences described in the preceding results sections a nd explanations are provided. Table 4.25 provides a summary of indicat ors and results obtained through the historical review, administrative data analysis and partner survey of the four integrated prevention and care demonstration projects. The projects were initiated within the context of a supportive environment that included pa rtnerships at the Pr ovincial (BCHS) and local (public health decision-ma kers and interested local physi cians) level. The projects were developed consecutively in areas with moderate to high hepatitis C rates in BC between 2001 and 2004. Kamloops, the first project, established the nurse-led collaborative practice model of service provi sion. It was replicated with only minor variations in three other ju risdictions. The projects have similar goals and services, including individual-based c linical and group-based community development/education services. The project nurses, recruited from public health units, expanded their scope of practice beyond the traditional public h ealth focus on prevention and community development. The expanded practice role in cluded leadership in service provision (e.g., assessment, monitoring and managing comple x anti-viral therapy, and partnership development). The nurses augment services in response to client needs through partnerships with autonomous health and support agencies or professionals. In Kamloops, different nurses are assigned to clinical a nd community services while the three other projects do not separate the roles. The three projects operational for more than five years, Kamloops, Prince George and Campbell River, concentrate their reach effort s on circumscribed areas within their larger RHA. These projects have reached 25% of those diagnosed with hepatitis C in their catchment area. Over the years, their reac h has increasingly exte nded beyond their project sites' urban centres to more rural and re mote areas. In contrast, Surrey, the youngest project, operational for 4 years, considers the entire RHA their catchment area but also concentrates on inner city populations. This project has reached about 2% of the diagnosed population due partly to the larger catchment area and b ecause it takes longer for health and social care professionals th roughout a large RHA to become aware of PhD Thesis - G.

Butt McMaster - Nursing 83their services. Surrey's reach to inner city populations is evidenced through the increasingly larger proportion of clients from the project's larger urban centre, Surrey. Among the projects, 20-28% of clients referr ed did not attend for services within 12 months of the referral date. The Campbell Rive r project had the highest referral and clinic attendance rates and the lowest percentage rate for provision for anti-viral therapy. Variation in anti-viral thera py success rates (57 to 76%) am ong the projects were likely due to different genotype case proportions. Fo r example, where larger proportions of clients with genotype type 1 are treated compared to genotype non-type 1 the overall response rates will be lower. All projects had partners representing hea lth services, public health and ancillary services. However, Surrey, the youngest project, had approximately half as many partners as the other projects and signi ficantly fewer health services partners than Campbell River. Mapping of project partner and referred client locations revealed that the majority were located in the urban centre in which the clinic was located with the exception of Campbell River which had a second cluster of clients and partners in a nearby urban centre. Paired nurse-partner ratings c onsistently indicated the grea test depth of nurse-partner involvement occurred in Surrey, the youngest pr oject, and lowest in Kamloops, the oldest project. Paired nurse-partner ratings for th e expected depth of i nvolvement were also lowest for Kamloops but highest for both Su rrey and Campbell River. When depth of involvement among all the partners was consid ered, Kamloops again exhibited the lowest ratings and Surrey the highest. Separation of the clinical and community development services in Kamloops may partially explai n why their partners were weakly-involved with each other, and therefore had the lowest depth of involvement in comparison to the other projects. Alternately, Kamloops as the most mature project, may have reached a stage in which the partners no longer expect to change their depth of involvement from the current state. This may mean that depth of involvement decreases over time, an idea which merits additional investigation. In regard to how well the pa rtners functioned as a group, partners at each project provided similar ratings (3.2 to 3.3) on the PSAT synergy scale, indicating moderate levels of group collaboration. There were differences in the ratings for partnership benefits. Prince George partne rs reported the least percentage benefit (67%) from the partnership and Campbell River the most (81%). However, all projects reported greater benefits than drawbacks. The two projects with the greatest depth of partner involvement, Surrey and Campbell River, evidenced signifi cant positive relations hips between high levels of partner involvement and group syne rgy or factors related to group synergy. Integration of the themes in the contextual and numeric data reveal that the four projects provide similar services through front-line nurse leadership and multiple partnerships with automonous agencies/professi onals. Striking similarities were observed among the projects in terms of the clients reach ed, the types of partne rs and the quality of partnership functioning. The proj ects varied in the number of partners and the depth of partner involvement. The youngest project had the fewest partners and the greatest depth PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 84of involvement while the olde st project showed the opposit e pattern. Where differences have been observed contextual explana tions were offered. Even though the results revealed local differences in the level of pa rtner involvement all projects evidenced good treatment success rates and three of the proj ects have reached 25% of the population in their referral areas. These results suggest that provision of care for clients with chronic hepatitis C may not require all partners to know or be highly involved with each other. As partnerships were initiated through the proj ect nurses, it would be interesting to investigate whether certain f actors present at the initia tion of these nurse-partner relationships, would lead some partners to become more involved than others. PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 855 DISCUSSION The purpose of this multi-method study was to describe four nurse-led hepatitis C integration projects in small urban/rural se ttings in BC and investigate the relationships between context, partnership structure a nd functioning and client/population outcomes. This study makes several contributions to the service integration lite rature. In accordance with complexity theory, the study included exploration of system components (e.g., partnership variables and servic e variables), as well as the pattern of relationships among the components (Cilliers, 1998; Wheat ley, 1992). The study design expanded the literature by adding considerati on of the context in which th e partnerships operate since contextual elements can influence outc omes (Allen & Hecht, 2004). Comparison of multiple dimensions of the four projects in creases our understanding of their similarities and how variations result from the local context. In addition, the study extends knowledge of interprofessional relationships beyond the pr esent focus on aspects of group functioning in formal meetings to include a rich description of multiple dimensions of informal relationships (Cott, 1997). This is the first Canadian study of its kind to describe relationships between integrated service delivery mechanisms (i .e., nurse leadership and interprofessional partnerships), and client/popul ation reach in four locations . This dissertation provides evidence regarding the leadership role of fr ont-line nurses in four community settings working to integrate hepatitis C prevention and care services th rough partnerships. The results support the assumption that IP arise to address the needs of those with chronic illness, which in this case was hepatitis C and associated issues. These locally-led hepatitis C services were able to increas e reach beyond Vancouver to smaller urban and rural areas throughout BC within a relatively short period of time. Clinical outcomes similar to or better than those reported in the liter ature were demonstrated. This study extends nursing knowledge beyond de scriptions of nursing leadership in academic and management positions largely w ithin hospital settings (Ahern et al., 2004; Ciliska et al., 2007; Leone, 2002). The study provides a novel account of leadership of front-line nurses working in community se ttings. In support of calls by McKeown and Gibson (2007) for political ac tion by nurses in hepatitis C care, the research findings demonstrated that nurses at the front-lines exerted influence in key areas of practice and service development. Project nurses stepped beyond their traditional roles and confronted barriers to comprehensive care in their pract ice environment. They expanded their scope of practice and developed IP with providers from autonomous organizations to meet diverse client needs. The projects were initiated during a pe riod when there was a high demand for hepatitis C services, potentially curative anti-viral therapies were emerging and professional service delivery systems were underdeveloped. In the global context, there was a corresponding change in health care policy that emphasized integration of professional services to improve chronic illn ess care and reduce serv ice gaps. This study provided a detailed example of how this polic y emphasis was adopted at the micro (front- line) level of service deliver y in a Canadian province. PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 86Analysis determined that the project nurses' partners represented diverse sectors (e.g., public health, health services and ancillary services), and affirms the study's conceptual underpinnings that identified the need for di verse partnerships to provide comprehensive chronic illness care. In contra st to evidence that community coalitions often fail, it is notable that all four project partnerships continue to f unction (Kreuter, Lezin & Young, 2000). Congruent with the findings of Pr ovan and colleagues (2005), partnership measurement was useful for demonstrating th e partner linkages and the highlighting the agencies and sectors that were part of the structure. The study employed both the IHSM and PSAT in a new context, informal fr ont-line staff partnerships where most communication is through electr onic or \"virtual\" means. As no identical programs were found in the literature, the study serves as a baseline for futu re studies, and highlights the need for continued research in this area. The projects have experienced consistent demand for service, which confirms the need for locally-available hepatitis C preven tion and care resources. Reach of 25% of the infected population (i.e. percentage of he patitis C antibody positive individuals referred to the projects) in three of the projects is a good indicator of success. If population reach was adjusted to account for the 15-40% of th e infected population th at may have cleared the virus naturally the percentage reach woul d be 29- 42% (Alter, 1993; Jauncey et al., 2004). In addition, those who were infected but not referred to the projects may have received specialty services elsewhere. The reach of the projects is remarkable since it is estimated that even though referral rates va ry according to the setting only a small proportion of those infected with hepatitis C have ever been referred for specialist consultation and follow-up (Dalgard et al., 2003 ; Irving et al., 2006; Mele et al., 2000). There are a number of intere sting contrasts between the populations served in the projects compared to those reported in the literature. Among the proj ects 72-80% of those referred attended for services in comparison to other integrated hepatitis C programs that reported 20-50% (Gunn et al., 2005; Subiadur et al., 2007). Estimates indicate that only 30% of people who are infected are likely to be eligible fo r treatment (Falck-Ytter et al., 2002; Fleming et al., 2003). Of the populations assessed in the projec ts 26-32% initiated anti-viral therapy in contrast to other comm unity-based programs that reported only 5- 10% of those assessed receive d treatment (Stringari-Murray et al., 2003; Zevin, 2007). In terms of treatment efficacy, clinical trials re port overall sustained viral response rates of 55% (Fried et al., 2002). The projects reported rates of 57 to 76%. Additionally, the projects reported that only 12% of those who started tr eatment withdrew because of adverse effects, which is compar able to clinical trials (Braga et al., 2006; Escudero et al., 2008; Fried et al., 2002; Zeuzem et al., 2000). What makes these results impressive is that the projects service 'real world cl ients' yet their results are sim ilar to clinical trials where clients may be carefully selected to en sure maximum compliance with therapy and optimal response rates. These positive outcome s may be related to the expanded role of the project nurses which includes management of antiviral therapy sinc e it is reported that client education and close monitoring by nurse s during therapy are major contributors to successful completion of hepatitis C ther apy (Leone, 2002; Strinko, Di Bisceglie, & PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 87Hoffman, 2004; Zeuzem, 2004). These results imply that the partnerships function effectively in reaching and providing services to the targeted populations. 5.1 Strengths and Limitations This study had several strengths and lim itations. The study was able to address variations in form, content and change over ti me in the projects by incorporating years of operation as an independent vari able. However, it was not pos sible to explore whether the length of time that individual partners where involved might have affected their scores on the two partnership measures in the cross-s ectional survey component of this research. The statistical power of the analysis was lim ited as there were only four projects (N=4) from which to relate variables to reach measures. A major strength of the study was the use of ad ministrative data to identify relevant clinical/population outcomes of the partnerships. Administra tive data has been shown to minimize data collection biases found in clin ical trials such as selective recall, non response, the Hawthorne effect and the he althy volunteer bias (Baron & Werneck, 2005; Price, Estrada, & Thompson, 2003). The readily available administrative dataset enable d identification of client characteristics, patterns of service use and c linical outcomes while minimizing data acquisition costs. Since the data were anonymized, ethical revi ew was expedited and client confidentiality was ensured. Given that data were electro nically stored it was easily extracted for analysis and just as easily expor ted to a GIS system in order to overlay several layers of data to simplify display of data relationships . In addition, the data were longitudinal and included the entire population enabling betw een project comparisons over time. Administrative data can constr ain the researcher to information that is useful mainly from an administrative perspective, limiting the scope of important health questions and constraining inquiries (Iezzoni et al., 1996). In this case the researcher was an insider, associated with the projects since incepti on, and provided input into the database design (i.e., how variables were defined, collected and entered). Quarte rly quality control measures embedded in the system provided checks for missing and inaccurate data so that corrections could be made in a timely manner. Howe ver, since data entry was done in the field and subject to severe time restrain ts, data fields were limited to the individual- based client services not allo wing for tracking or analysis of community-based education or development activities. The conceptual model and research assumpti ons were helpful for guiding the inquiry and focusing the analysis. However, during th e analysis a limitation of the conceptual model became evident. Although it was assume d that front-line staff partnerships are self-forming structures that ar ise out of the provision of chro nic illness care the model did not include assumptions on whether any particul ar partner was central to the formation of the partnerships or what form the initia l partner formations would take. Through the historical review it was evident that the pr oject nurses were central to partnership development and that partnerships were fo rmed through development of multiple nurse- to-partner relationships. The measurement of these hub and wheel type of relationships PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 88was not considered a priori. It was fortunate for the researcher that the data collected for the IHSM, although originally intended for aggregated measurement of the composite partner group, could be employed to analyse sp ecific nurse-partner linkages. However, it was not appropriate to employ the PSAT to e xplore the quality of functioning of these dyadic relationships. These findings point to th e need to revise the conceptual model and consider other methods of measurement to better understand partners with a hub and wheel formation that over time becomes an interconnected group as presented in the model and confirmed in the study results. This study provided an extensive descripti on of the functioning and achievements at the front-lines of service delivery (micro leve l). For those wishing to replicate aspects of these projects, at the provincial (macro level) and regional health authority (meso) levels further exploration is required to determine what impact provincial coordination through BCHS, and local support from public health decision-makers and physician specialists had on the success and sustainability of the projects. 5.2 Implications for research The conceptual model outlined that IP are expected to impact three constituent groups: the partners, service recipients and the partners ' respective organizations. Outcomes of IP may vary depending on the perspectives of those who are surveyed (Boyne et al., 2003; Glendinning, 2002; Su llivan & Skelcher, 2002). This study demonstrated the feasibility of measuring partner perspectives and client-based clinical outcomes. Future research should include measurement of perspectives of service recipients (clients) and partner organizati ons. Since the study results illuminated the effectiveness of an expanded nursing practi ce role to increase capacity for specialty services in small urban/rural areas future studies should include a cost-effectiveness analysis. A clinically important finding is that a significant number of individuals with hepatitis C who are referred for specialty assessment do not attend for services. The reasons for and impact of these decisions requires further inves tigation. In addition, studies of the characteristics of populations referred vs. thos e not referred could inform whether outreach efforts should be intensified. 5.3 Implications for education and practice There is an enormous b ody of knowledge on leadership but the issues surrounding leadership of virtual partners hips are just beginning to emer ge (Avolio, Kahai, & Dodge, 2000; Zigurs, 2003). Nurses need to understand and act on the clinic al and educational implications of leadership in virtual partnerships, which cr oss disciplinary and jurisdictional boundaries. Such IP are especially critical in rural areas where there are fewer health and social care resources, a sm all number of agencies, and less diversity and specialization because half of all Canadi ans live in rural communities, that is, communities with less than 100,000 people (Poli vka et al., 2001; Statistics Canada, May 2005). In addition, for the case of hepatitis C, the complexity of care combined with the changing knowledge of the disease, its impact and treatments, requires front-line staff to PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 89base their practice on emerging evidence rather than established protocols. This requires education that supports strong skills in critical appraisal of researc h, clinical practice and leadership at the front-lines. 5.4 Implications for Policy Underlying the policy emphasis on IP is the assumption that this form of service delivery will ultimately save the system money. Using a theoretical framework, the present study demonstrated that four projec ts initiated within public health achieved important population outcomes through IP and minimal new funding. Policy makers should consider adapting the conceptual framewor k advanced in this study to assist in the evaluation of policy outcomes. According to Niessin and colleagues (2000) health policy and services should be developed based on systematically collected da ta on the effects of interventions that are grounded in the health and social sciences. Based on this research and public health's history of and mandate for disease prevention and control, policy ma kers could consider expanding the role of public health nurses to include disease management for those with chronic infectious diseases where such serv ices are underdeveloped as in the small urban and rural areas of BC. This research demonstr ated that such an approach is feasible, acceptable and appropriate. 5.5 Conclusion This is the first Canadian study of its kind to describe relationships between nurse leadership, IP and client/ population outcomes. Although the literature contains an abundance of conceptualizations for service integration ther e is little evidence to guide practice. This study provides support for the syne rgistic effects of nurse leadership and IP on health outcomes in the context of an emerging disease and scarce health care resources. The benefits of IP were de monstrated on multiple levels, with clear implications for policy, research, education and practice. Future research should be directed at refining the conceptual m odel and extending partnership measurement approaches to include hub and wheel partne rship relationships and expanding participant recruitment to include all the constitu ent groups: care providers, recipients and participating organizations.

A significant achievement of this collaboration has been the development of four systems-integration pilot projects for hepatitis prevention and care. The pr ojects were implemented using a collaborative community-oriented and staged approach with Inte rior Health (Kamloops) starting in July 2001, Vancouver Island Health (Campbell River) and Northern Health (Prince George) in 2002, and Fraser Health (Surrey) in 2003. The staging method facilitated a process that allowed each program design to emerge according to local needs while facilitating exchange of ideas and learning within the project sites thus embedding a rapid change/quality improvement approach. An important part of the pilot projects is th eir partnerships with local services/agencies. The purpose of the survey is to obtain inform ation to better unders tand and describe the quality and outcomes of the local partnerships . The results of the survey will be provided to all partners to facilitate future planning both locally and provincially. What Will the Study Involve? You are asked to complete a survey c ontaining two questionnaires, The Human Services Measure and the Partnership Self-A ssessment Tool. The survey will take about 20 minutes to complete. The survey will prov ide information on the type and extent of service integration among partner agencies and the processes that assist or hinder collaboration. Who Will Be Asked to Participate in the Study? Staff and managers of th e 4 pilot sites and those services/agencies with which they work will be asked to participate in the survey. Participation is entirely voluntary and confidential. You will not be asked to iden tify yourself except to provide the name of the agency and the health authority where you work. Participation or non-participation in PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 113this research will not affect BC Hepatitis Services funding or support for the pilot projects or their partners . You may withdraw your pa rticipation at any time. How Will the Research Findings Be Used? All invited, whether they c hoose to participate or not, will receive a summary of the survey results shortly after gathering th e feedback from each of the services. The results will help the pilot projects, their pa rtners and BC Hepatitis Services to identify areas of strength and weakne ss, identify barriers and facilitators for effective collaboration and service integration, and w ill enhance planning. No individuals will be named or otherwise identified in any publication of the data.

The survey consists of two questionnaires that measure the degree and qua lity of integration among service providers PhD Thesis - G. Butt McMaster - Nursing 115in your specific pilot proj ect area (areas include: Vanc ouver Island Health Authority, Northern Health Authority, Fraser Health Au thority, and Interior Health Authority). The survey takes 20 minutes to co mplete at one time only. Participation in the study is voluntary. You ma y withdraw from the study at any time or refuse permission to use your questionnair e responses. You are being invited to participate in this research project because you are a staff member or manager in the pilot project or because you have been nominated by the staff or managers as a member of the network of service providers in the pilot site area and you are able to read and write in English. You understand that, if you do not wish to participate in the study, it will not affect your job or your provision of ca re to people with hepatitis C. If you agree to take part in the study, your consent will be assumed upon receipt of your completed questionnaires. You can complete the questionnaires at any time in the four weeks following the invitation to participate. The questi onnaires ask you to rate your level of integration with other participating agencies or services. You will also be asked to answer two questions about what helps you to collaborate with other agencies and what hinders you from collaborating. You will be asked only to identify your servic e/agency and your health authority on the questionnaires. Your name will not be used in the tabulation of the survey data. Only the research team will have access to the survey responses; the responses will be stored in a locked filing cabinet to which only the Prin cipal Investigator has a key. Computer files associated with the project will be password protected. Paper copies of survey responses will be shredded in ten years following the completion of the study. Any electronic data files will be destroyed using software to ensure complete destruction of the data. The findings of the research may be published but your name will not be associated with the study. There are no known risks to the research. If you agree to participate, you will contribute information that will help to develop a m odel that explains and describes how the network of partnerships in th e hepatitis C pilot projects pr ovides integrated prevention and care. This knowledge could strengthen pa rtnerships to provide more accessible and effective care. You will recei ve a summary of the result s of the research upon its completion. You are encouraged to contact the Principal Investigator, Gail Butt, if you have any questions regarding the study. She will attempt to answer any questions you might have prior to, during or following the study. If you agree to participate in the study, you can complete the survey during non-work hours.
