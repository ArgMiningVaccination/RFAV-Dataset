Most cases were mild and responded well to treatment and rest.

There is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine affects adolescent development or future fertility. If you have questions or concerns, talk to your child's doctor. AFTER GETTING VACCINATED Your child is fully vaccinated 2 weeks after they get their 2nd Pfizer vaccine. It takes time for the body to build immunity. Once your child is fully vaccinated, they will be protected when they visit with friends, play sports, travel to see family, and return to school. If your child is fully vaccinated, they do not need to quarantine if a friend, family member, teacher or teammate gets COVID-19. BEFORE YOUR CHILD GETS VACCINATED Talk to your child about the vaccine, possible side effects, and what to expect at their vaccination visit. Be sure the vaccination site is offering the Pfizer vaccine. Check to see how parent consent needs to be given. Get your child caught up on other vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccine can be given at the same time, before, or after other routine vaccines. "}
