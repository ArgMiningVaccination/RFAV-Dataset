What About Tetanus? By Pam Cameron, RN With flu season just around the corner, now's the time to consider if you need this year's flu vaccine to reduce your risk of getting bitten by the \"bug.\" Below are some questions and answers to consider in making your decision about the flu shot and other adult immunizations, such as the new chickenpox vaccine or tetanus booster. I keep hearing about the flu shot. Who really needs it? An annual flu shot can be potentially life-saving and is highly recommended for people with medical conditions that put them at risk for flu-related complications. This includes people over 65, those with heart problems, lung or kidney disease, asthma, diabetes, cancer, HIV infection and any illness or treatment that weakens your immunity. It is also recommended for those who care for or live with someone with these high-risk medical conditions. I am healthy, without any medical problem. Should I get a flu shot anyway? If your job entails high public contact where you can become infected or infect others with the flu, the vaccine may prevent you from getting the flu or lessen your symptoms. This group includes staff on the front-lines with lots of student and public contact and child care and health care workers. Some healthy adults decide to get the shot to reduce the risk of being laid up with the flu. Still others attempt to lessen their chances with good health habits--getting plenty of rest and practicing frequent handwashing--which also helps to prevent the spread of colds. The flu vaccine won't prevent the common cold. How do I know if I shouldn't receive the vaccine? People who shouldn't receive the vaccine include those allergic to eggs (used to make the vaccine) and anyone who has been paralyzed with Guillian Barr\u00e9 Syndrome. Persons ill with a fever should wait until they are recovered. Women who are or may be pregnant should check with their health care provider. Can I get the flu from the flu shot? No. Since the vaccine is non-infectious, it cannot cause the flu. The shot, given in the arm, causes few side effects with the most common being soreness at the injection site. Less than one third of those who receive the vaccine experience fever, aches or malaise, which may last one to two days. Is the new chickenpox (Varicella) vaccine just for children? No. Although most adults are immune to chickenpox, those who are not should speak with their clinician about the benefits and risks of being vaccinated. Pregnant women should not take this vaccine, and pregnancy should be avoided for three months following vaccination. I'm planning a trip to South America. Should I get the new Hepatitis A vaccine? Perhaps. Travelers to Africa, Middle East, Central and South America and Asia (except Japan) may benefit when given the hepatitis vaccine at least two weeks prior to departure. Depending on your destination, your physician or International Travel Care at the UHS can recommend additional vaccinations to keep you healthy. As a 35-year-old woman in good health, do I have other immunization needs? Yes. The place to begin is to talk with your primary care clinician who can tailor immunization recommendations to your age, sex, lifestyle, work and family exposure, health status, etc. Adults need a tetanus-diphtheria booster every 10 years. Other vaccines to Coverage for vaccinations varies between health care plans. Where To Go for More Help . . .

The award citation states, in part, that \"Goodman's contributions to sociology are broad and deep. His name is associated especially with advances in categorical data analysis. He is far and away the most imporatant scholar in the development of these methods....His contributions have transformed the way we work.\" George Leitman, emeritus professor of engineering, professor in the graduate school, and president of the Alexander von Humboldt Association of America, was honored by the association on the occasion of his 70th birthday. The association sponsored a reception and dinner in Berkeley attended by 120 Humboldt fellows, awardees and distinguished guests. At the dinner, Leitman was presented with a proclamation from the Russian Consulate, citing his contributions to science, engineering and international relations. A subsequent symposium in honor of Leitman, organized by colleagues and former students, featured presenters from 14 countries. At a dinner following the symposium, the Bellman Continuum Society presented Leitman with the first Bellman Continuum Award of Excellence dedicated to the continuation of the work of reknowned mathematician Richard Bellman. Leitman also has been elected a corresponding member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and a foreign member of the Academy of Engineering of the Republic of Georgia. In November, Leitman will be presented with the 1995 Rufus Oldenburger Medal at the annual meeting of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The medal is awarded for outstanding achievements in the field of automatic control; in Leitman's case, for \"significant contributions to the theory and application of optimal control and differential games, and for pioneering work in the deterministic treatment of uncertainties in linear and nonlinear control systems.\" Richard S.
