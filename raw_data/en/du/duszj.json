The tingling and glow of your gem signify that it is in its best form, fully capable of providing you with energy and excitement. However, once the crystal starts feeling differently while holding it in your hand, it means it is time to charge and cleanse it. The first indicator your Amethyst needs cleaning is the feeling of the heaviness of the gem. The stone's weight is a sign it has absorbed too much negative energy, and if you want to keep using it for its beneficial properties, you need to cleanse it.

Otherwise, your Amethyst will stop being effective and only reclaim the negative energies within it. Most importantly, you don't have to be an expert to do this properly. On the contrary, start by visualizing the negative and harmful energies, feelings, and thoughts being cleansed away from the crystal and your life. In addition, water is the best cleansing method. Therefore if you live near a river, ocean, or sea, hold your Amethyst stone underwater to quickly recharge and cleanse it. However, if you are not someone that lives near water, running your crystal under tap water can also do the trick. Also, you can use several other methods to prepare your crystal and activate its powers. Earth Cleansing To get rid of any remaining energies in your Amethyst, it's recommended to bury it in the earth. Additionally, returning the crystal to its place of origin is a powerful and effective method of cleansing it. Moon Cleansing To purify your Amethyst crystals, expose them to moonlight energy.
