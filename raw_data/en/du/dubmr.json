The Society spends more money on MS research than any other voluntary health agency in the world, investing some $40 million annually on research programs. This includes more than 350 MS research investi- gations at the best medical centers, universi-ties and other institutions throughout the United States and abroad. By the end of FY 2006, the Society will have spent $500 million on research-related programs since its founding. (See Timeline on pages 18-19 for a history of research sup-port and progress, and Research at a Glance on page 20 for general overview.) This in- vestment is paying off in significant progress toward finding treatments and in better diag- nosis, rehabilitation and symptomatic ther- apy for people with all forms of MS. Where Does the Research Money Come From? The nationwide network of National MS Society chapters, through generous contribu-tors, provides the lion's share of support for the research program. Of the unrestricted in- come Society chapters share with the Home Office, half goes toward MS research pro-grams. Research also receives half of the Home Office's share of direct mail net income and 100 percent of all donations restricted to re- search. This includes gifts received through the Research Honor Roll, a program recog-nizing Society chapters that provide re- search-restricted gifts beyond the share that normally goes to the Home Office. Research & Clinical Programs 733 Third Avenue New York, NY 10017-3288 1-800-FIGHT MS www.NationalMSSociety.org F.A.Q. About Society-Funded MS Research The National Multiple Sclerosis Society wa s founded in 1946 to end the devastating effects of MS by aiding individuals with the di sease and by propelling th e search for a cure. The Society carries out its research mission by providing financial support to the brightest scientists and physicians exploring questions underlying MS, and by attracting and training promising young investigators to carry on this vital work. The National MS Society has laid a foundation of basic and clinical knowledge upon which virtually all advancements are built, and has planted the seeds for tomorrow's breakthroughs. Inside...

As shown in Figure 1, research programs account for about 44 pe rcent of all Home Office expenses. When expenditures of chapters and the Ho me Office are com- bined, research accounts for 20 percent of all money spent by the Society. How Does Society Research Spend-ing Compare to that of Other Agencies? The Society's research investment can be compared with other vol untary health agen- cies, that, like the Society, consider both re- search and client programs significant parts of their mission. For example, research ac-counts for 15 percent of expenditures at the American Cancer Society, 24 percent at the American Diabetes Association, and 24 percent at the American Heart Association. The main source of MS research funding in the U.S. is the federal government's Na- tional Institutes of Health (NIH). Through several of its branches, the NIH spends ap-proximately $109 million annually for MS- related research. Ot her governments, foun- dations and agencies, such as member so- cieties of the Multiple Sclerosis Interna- tional Federation, also fund MS research. Where Does the Society's Research Money Go? The Society's research programs budget supports a spectrum of research grants and training fellowships, which includes support for research personnel, supplies and equip- ment. The Society also supports scientific Figure 1. Expenses of all NMSS chapters co mbined with those of the Home Office (left) and the Home Office alone. Res earch accounted for 20 percent of FY 2005 combined expenses, and 44 perc ent of Home Office expenses.

The research programs budget also sup- ports the peer review process, and staff and other administrative costs involved in actu- ally running the program. Does the Society Run its Own Labs? No. This would duplicat e facilities already available at top-notc h universities. The So- ciety instead funds investigators working on basic or clinical research projects at their own institutions. Where is the Society Investing the Most Research Dollars? The Society supports MS research in the U.S. and abroad. The institutions that cur-rently receive the most research support for their investigators are: -Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital -University of California at San Francisco -Johns Hopkins University -University of Wisconsin-Madison -Mayo Clinic and Foundation -Cleveland Clinic Foundation -University of Cambridge -Stanford University Does the Society Have Sufficient Funds to Support Emerging Research Opportunities? No. The cost of undertaking scientific re- search is escalating fast er than the cost of living, and new high-powered technologies are both resource- and staff-intensive. At the same time, NIH funding for research related to MS is very tight. The Society makes commitments to indi- vidual research projects based on future in- come projections. Even when we make a commitment, it is made pending the avail- ability of funds. We do not have \"in the bank\" sufficient funds to cover our current and out-year costs for projects to which we have made commitments. Our current and out-year commitments for ongoing research projects are nearly $90 million. As we increase focus on lar- ger-scale, \"big ticket\" undertakings, we will have additional pres sures on our expend- able research budget. How does the Society decide which direction we should be taking in research? Strategic research decisions at the Society are made through a process of consensus building among members of expert interna-tional volunteer advisory committees and specially constituted or commissioned groups engaged for such purposes. The Society's Research Programs Advi- sory Committee is charged with ongoing review of the state of MS research and recommending areas for new focus or Awards to Speed Cure Ralph I. Straus Award: $1 million cash prize to any scientist(s) whose research leads to the development of a way to prevent or arrest MS John Dystel Prize for Multiple Sclerosis Research: annual cash prize awarded to an investigator for out- standing contributions to research 4 changed emphasis. Over the past 20 years, the Society has also conducted strategic reviews through which we gather broad thinking and perspective from advisors on the highest priority areas for support, on gaps that may exist, and on allocation of relatively limited funds among many re-search program options and directions. These reviews, including an Institute of Medicine review commissioned by the So-ciety, have resulted in changes in program directions, new targeted research areas, and new programs. Why is Research Funded Through the Home Office, Instead of Through Individual Society Chapters? The Society established its centralized peer-review system to ensure that every penny of the research money is spent on MS investigations that have the greatest chances of success. Th at means the grant- ees have been deemed by their peers to have the ideas, skills, talent and technical and institutional support to carry out their important work. The centralized peer -review system ensures that funds are allocated to the best projects, without geographic bias. This means that no matter where in the U.S. or other parts of the world Society research is taking place, donors and Society members from every chapter can be assured that their contributions are funding the best MS research around the world - research that is the most likely to result in solutions that will end the devastating effects of MS. Who Decides What Research Gets Funded? The Society receives some 450 proposals annually from researchers who hope to ex-plore particular aspects of multiple sclero- sis. These proposals are reviewed by vol- unteer panels who help determine the sci-entific merit of research proposals and their relevance to the problems of MS. These panels include some 75 leading scientists, physicians and other professionals from virtually every field related to MS, who volunteer over 2,000 hours each year to carefully evaluate the quality, relevance and budget of each proposal. Panelists review proposals for their sci- entific merit and rele vance to MS, the nov- elty of their ideas, experience and produc- tivity of the applicants, collaborators and institutional environment. The proposals are ranked in order of priority to be recom- mended for funding. The senior oversight committee (Research Programs Advisory Committee) reviews the results of the other committees' recommendations, and also helps to develop polic y and set priorities for the research program. In addition to its standing review com- mittees, the Society frequently convenes special task forces and other committees to focus on emerging research trends and to help steer our research efforts in new direc-tions. For a list of peer reviewers, visit our Web site at: http://www.NationalMSSociety.org/Scientific Peer Reviewers.asp. 5 How Does the Society Ensure Fair Grant Reviews? Because of the very specialized and techni- cal aspects of research proposals, the Soci- ety relies on the peer review process and takes pains to find k nowledgeable and fair reviewers. In addition, steps are taken to eliminate potential conflicts of interest. For example, panel members annually certify their adherence to the Society's \"Conflict of Interest and Disc losure Policies,\" and individual panel members do not rate pro-posals from any investigators at their own institutions. Panelists are required to leave the room when such proposals are dis-cussed and rated by other reviewers. What are Some Reasons for Rejecting a Research Proposal? There are many potential reasons a re- search proposal may be rejected by peer reviewers, and every applicant gets written comments on problems, as well as sugges-tions on how to improve the proposal. Some typical problems may include: the experimental design would not pro- vide the answers the applicant suggests; lack of preliminary data to suggest the experiments may work; proposed experiments have already been done or are being pursued by others; the question being asked is not clearly defined in terms of its importance and relevance to MS; insufficient experience, knowledge of field, equipment, institutional support or collaborators for the proposed project. What Happens After Peer Reviewers Make Their Recommendations? The advisory panels pass on their recom- mendations to the Research Programs Ad-visory Committee for further deliberation. Final recommendations are made to the President and CEO. Projections of Society income and re- search programs expenditures dictate the number of proposals that can be committed for funding. Funding commitments are made according to rank assigned during the review process. How Does the Society Keep Track of Researchers' Progress? The staff of the Research & Clinical Pro- grams Department of the Home Office closely monitors efforts of investigators funded by the Society through required an-Training: Investing in the Cure The Society offers diverse postdoctoral and physician training programs to attract and keep promising young scientists and clinicians to the field of MS: Some of the most prominent research- ers making MS breakthroughs today were Society trainees. Ours is the only postdoctoral training program in the U.S. specifically focused on MS. Our training programs ensure there are highly skilled experts focusing their attention on problems of MS. Research fellows are the \"hands\" in laboratories that get much of the work done. 6 nual progress and financial reports. Re- searchers are required to state their step-by-step plans at the outset of their projects, and to detail the strides taken in each step at annual intervals. In addition, if grantees return to the Na- tional MS Society requesting continuing support, our peer review panels scrutinize their proposals for evidence that significant headway was made during the previous grant period. Research progress is also monitored by direct interaction with grantees, by review- ing major scientific journals where find-ings are published, and by staff attendance at scientific conferences, where researchers report findings to their peers. What type of Research Support Does the Society Offer? Sixty-two percent of all projects are multi- year research grants, accounting for 72% of research award expenditures. Awards include: Research grants: investigations of 1-5 years by experienced scientists for basic, clinical and rehabilita tion research; average new award $475,000 Collaborative Research Center Awards: 5-year grants to interdisciplinary teams of researchers to stimulate cross-pollination of ideas and attract new minds to the field of MS; maximum award $825,000 Pilot research grants: (see box this page) short-term projects to test new ideas; maximum award $44,000 Postdoctoral fellowships: research pro- jects from 1-3 years by investigators work- ing under the mentorsh ip of senior scien- tists; average new award $150,000 Sylvia Lawry Physician Fellowships: support for up to 3 years to train young doctors to conduct MS clinical trials; max. award $120,000 NMSS/AAN MS Clinician Scientist Development Awards: 2 years of support to young physicians to receive training in MS clinical research; up to $75,000/year Career Transition Fellowships: awards up to 5 years to facilitate the advancement of promising young investigators into full faculty positions; about $550,000 Harry Weaver Neuroscience Scholar Awards: 5-year projects by promising young investigators starting their careers as independent researchers; average new award $600,000 Testing New Ideas The Society's Pilot Research Program was begun in 1987 to fund short-term projects to investigate new, untested ideas and attract new researchers to the MS field. These unique grants al- low researchers to quickly gather data needed for full grant applications and determine whether their novel ideas are worth pursuing.

Typically $150,000 annually Translational Research Partnerships on Nervous System Repair and Protection in MS: collaborative teams to pave the way for clinical testing to restore function in people with MS; total committed for five years to four teams is $15.6 million What is the Research Focus? Research funded by the Society falls under several general catego ries. (See Figure 3 for distribution of support.) They include: Therapy of MS : investigations into treat- ments of possible value in fighting or im- proving symptoms in all forms of MS; Care, Management, Rehabilitation, Psychosocial: seeking ways to maximize physical and mental abilities and reduce symptoms to improve quality of life; Immunology : exploring the role of the im- mune system in the development and pro- gression of MS to find ways to stop the immune attack on nervous tissues; Nerve Tissue Repair and Myelin Biology : investigating ways to restore nerve function by studying glial cells that produce myelin, and other factors that play a role in tissue health and repair; (continued on page 8) Research Philosophies Fund the best, most relevant re- search : Our peer reviewers rate projects for excellence and rele- vance to MS, and we do not fund projects that are deemed to have no relevance to the problems of MS. Focus on any topic relevant to MS: These range from the most ba- sic question about how myelin- making cells read signals to clinical trials of promising treatments. Fund investigator-initiated and Society-targeted research: We in- vite scientists to come to us with their new ideas, and we also proac-tively target areas that are ripe for exploration. Centralized peer review: This helps us avoid geographic and po- litical biases, and helps us identify the best research projects in which to invest our money. Seek out new ideas: Our high- risk pilot program gives investiga- tors access to quick funding to test out untried ideas. The Society also convenes task forces to develop the best research strategies to move the field forward. Foster collaboration and inter- disciplinary approaches: We offer funding, such as the Collaborative MS Research Center Awards, tai- lored to foster cross-pollination and bring in new researchers whose ex- pertise is relevant to MS. We also support workshops that cross dis-ease boundaries. 8 Genetics : hunting for seve ral genes that may make people susceptible to MS, for hunting for several ge nes that may make people susceptible to MS, for clues to its cause and better treatment; Infectious Triggers : examining the possi- bility that viruses or bacteria could act as disease triggers in MS; Neuropathology/Neurophysiology : exploring fundamental workings of nerve cells and how they b ecome damaged at dif- ferent stages of MS; Health Care Delivery & Policy : studying how people with MS utilize health-care ser- vices and how health-care delivery can be improved; Resource Banks: Tissue and DNA banks that accumulate and store specimens for use by MS investigators. Why Does the Society Support Research on All Types of Human Cells? MS is considered an autoimmune disease where the body attacks itself resulting in damage to the nervous system. MS can cause paralysis, blindness, cognitive dys- function, mobility impairment and many other serious symptoms. To find new ways to prevent, slow or repair the devastating ef- fects of MS, the National MS Society sup- ports the conduct of scientifically meritori- Figure 3. Distribution of National MS Soci ety funding in major areas of research. Immunology, nerve tissue repair and myelin biology are major avenues of investi- gation. About 15% is invested in areas focusing on helping people with MS now, including therapies, rehabilitation, psyc hosocial issues and disease activity. Distribution of Current Support Among Avenues of Research 4.5% MS Genetics 5% Therapy, Rehabilitation, Psychosocial Measuring MS Activity 21% Nerve Repair 8% Nerve pathology, physiology 4.5% Healthcare Delivery, Policy 9 Society-Targeted Research and Care Initiatives To encourage innovative research into highly promising areas and to improve MS patient care, the National MS Society launched the Pro mise: 2010 Campaign. This nationwide effort fueled by local MS chapters w ill raise at least $30 million to f und four targeted areas that hold great potential in the fight against the deva stating effects of MS, but which have so far been under-explored. Nervous System Repair and Protection: This bold international initiative with its col- laborative team approach has been established to study tissue re pair and protection in MS. To tackle this goal $15.6 million has b een allocated to four new grants - the largest single grants ever awarded by the Society. This research sets the stage to help transl ate basic science into meaningful, better therapies for people with MS in the future by restoring nerve function. The four interdisciplinary teams are being le d by Drs. Peter Calabresi (Johns Hopkins), Ian D. Duncan (University of Wisconsin), Charles ffrench-Constant (Cambridge University) and Gavin Giovannoni (University Co llege London), and involve co llaborators in the Canada, Europe and the U.S. Pediatric MS Centers of Excellence: About 8,000-10,000 childr en have MS, and an- other 10,000-15,000 experience what may be MS symptoms. MS is difficult to diagnose in children and most pediatricians are not familiar with MS. A first-of-its kind network of Pedi- atric MS Centers of Excellence has been create d to set the standard for pediatric MS care. This integrated network will offer optimal me dical and psychosocial support to children and their families, serve as a clearinghouse for information about childhood MS, and will con- duct critical research to understand both childh ood and adult MS. Six funded centers are led by Drs. Jayne Ness (Children' s Hospital of Alabama), Bianca Weinstock-Guttman (State University of New York, Buffalo), Nancy K untz & Moses Rodriguez (Mayo Clinic Roches- ter), Lauren Krupp (Stony Brook University Ho and California, San Francisco). The Sonya Slifka Longitudinal MS Study: The first study of its kind in the U.S., the Sonya Slifka Longitudinal MS Study is a reposito ry of in-depth information about the lives of people with MS. Investigat ors are collecting detailed data from a national sampling of 2,000 individuals. This study integrates clinical information, healthcare practices, and socio- economic data to learn what happens to people with MS over time and what factors influ- ence the long-term course of MS. The study is overseen by Sarah Minde n, MD, of Abt Asso- ciates in Cambridge, Mass. The MS Lesion Project : This international collaboration led by Claudia Lucchinetti, MD, at the Mayo Clinic seeks patterns in the MS dama ge seen in brain tissue and attempts to cor- relate those findings with actual clinical signs, symptoms, and responses to therapy. This ef- fort provides vital information on the underlying pathology of MS and the impact of specific treatments. It is the most extensive attempt ever made to map and understand the meaning of MS damage seen in the brain. With this know ledge, we hope to develo p better ways of treat- ing people who exhibit specific patterns of disease. 10 ous medical research, including research using human cells, in accordance with federal, state and local laws and with ad- herence to the strictest ethical and proce- dural guidelines. The Society supports public policy that it believes is consistent with this position, and opposes public policy that it believes is not consistent with this position. Why Does the Society Fund Animal Research? We are dedicated to finding the cure for MS. This means supporting basic research and clinical trials to test promising treat- ments. While about 45% of all funded re-search projects focus on humans or hu-man tissues, the human body is a remark- able collection of complex systems that cannot be artificially replicated. This makes animal testing essential to efforts to develop new treatments for MS. Studies on animal models of MS - EAE (experimental allergic encephalomyelitis) or other models - have been at the core of much of the fundamental knowledge about the immunological and neurobio- logical processes that underlie MS. Using animal models, the potential value of co-polymer 1, now known as Copaxone, was demonstrated; using animal models, the value of mitoxantrone - now known as Novantrone and approved for worsening MS - was demonstrated to control pro- gression of MS-like disease. Studies on the viability of transplanting myelin- making cells and on the role of antibodies in remyelination have all had their origins in animal-based work. Using high-powered genetic engineer- ing techniques, investigators can now \"create\" animal models of MS that allow the understanding of the specific role of one immune cell type in the disease proc- ess; using animal models, we can test the potential for use of growth factors to re- generate damaged my elin and nerve tis- sues. None of these experiments could be done in their early stages in humans. Ani- mal research is an e ssential component of unraveling the basic underpinnings of MS. It has proven to be absolutely essen- tial for the development of therapies cur-rently used for treatment of MS today, and will continue to be important in the future. Current Health Care Delivery and Policy Research Topics Quality of health care and mental health care in MS Accessibility and impact of dis-ease modifying agents Delivery of health care to people with MS living in rural areas The long-term care needs of peo- ple with MS Evaluating MS adult day programs Aging with MS: unmet needs in the Great Lakes region Health care experiences of persons with MS from minority popula- tions Insurance issues of NMSS mem- bers 11 Why Does the Society Support Health Care Delivery Research? If the cure for MS were found tomor- row, it would be meaningless if people who have the disease could not gain ac- cess to the treatment. Even today, with multiple drugs available that can help many people with MS , and with physi- cal therapy and exercise regimens that can help individuals maximize their ca- pabilities, impediments can prevent peo-ple from getting the care they need. The focus of the National MS Soci- ety's Health Care Delivery and Policy Research program is to study the wide variety of issues that can reduce the quality of health care received by indi-viduals with MS, with the ultimate goal of improving quality of life. (See box, page 10 for current topics.) What Research is the Society Funding on Progressive MS? Since its inception, the National MS Society has been actively involved in supporting studies related to progressive MS. The more than 350 research pro- jects we're currently funding explore virtually every aspect of MS, as well as more basic research into nervous system development and repair and the work- ings of the immune system. Most of these projects do not focus on any par- ticular form of MS, but aim to build un- derstanding of what causes all forms of MS and how to correct the problem. We also support projects specifically fo- cused on progressive forms of MS. Current Society-funded projects fo- cusing specifically on issues related to Some Intriguing Leads in MS Research The farther one lives from the equator, the higher one's risk of MS. Society researchers are exploring whether sunlight exposure is a protective factor. Is being too clean a set up for getting MS? MS is less common in underdeveloped re- gions, and early exposure to common infec- tious agents may stimulate the immune regu-lation in a positive way. Society investigators are testing whether exposure to harmless parasites can reduce disease activity. Can robotics retrain the brain to improve walking ability? Based on the idea that repe- tition can help restore st rength, balance, rec- ognition of sensory cues that make walking possible, Society res earchers are using ro- botic devices to help people walk on a tread- mill in hopes of improving walking ability. Abnormalities in the MS brain have been seen even in areas that appear healthy. Are they there before MS, and contribute to its onset, or are they caused by the disease? So- ciety investigators are using advanced MRI techniques to follow this and other clues. Our brains have stores of cells capable of replacing myelin. Can scientists find a way to stimulate these cells to repair MS damage, or do cell transplants hold more promise? Society researchers are on the cutting edge of these important questions. MS costs the U.S. economy about $20 bil- lion per year. Our health care delivery and policy researchers are investigating this and other important issues, such as job discrimi-nation, insurance experiences, and optimal health care settings. 12 progressive MS include: Two studies at the University of Cali- fornia at San Francisco seeking new MR techniques to image spinal cord damage in MS, and tracking, in different types of MS including primary progressive, a nerve chemical that may ov er-excite cells and contribute to tissue damage; A study at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospi- tal in New York City, searching for possi-ble gene variations that may account for MS susceptibility and progression in some individuals; A study at the University of California at Los Angeles using new MRI techniques to discover factors contributing to onset of progression; A Brigham and Women's Hospital study tracking small brain lesions in peo-ple with different forms of MS, including progressive forms, and correlating with clinical symptoms; A study at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, tracking individuals with mild MS-related cognitive problems to evaluate whether this symptom pro-gresses over time; A study at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas ex-amining the immune dynamics at work in primary-progressive MS; A University of Louisville study exam- ining a subset of immune cells that appear to contribute to a more severe, progressive disease course in mice, for clues to factors controlling MS progression in people; A study at the Samuel Merritt College in Oakland investigating a novel approach for improving walking and balance in MS; A Clarkson University (Potsdam, NY) study evaluating a wheelchair-mounted robot to improve function for people with MS; A study at V A Western NY Healthcare in Buffalo using novel imaging methods to track the activity of i mmune cells in secon- dary-progressive MS; A SUNY Upstate Medical University (Syracuse) study on the impact of an aquatic exercise pr ogram on function and quality of life; A study at the University of California at Los Angeles testing locomotor training to improve walking ability in people with MS-related disability; A study at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston testing for bacteria in people with primary- progressive and other forms of MS, for clues to the role of infectious agents in dis- ease development; In the ongoing \"MS Lesion Project,\" Mayo Clinic investigators, with interna- tional collaborators, are analyzing MS brain lesions to link the clinical manifesta-tions of MS and findings from MR imag-ing to the pathology seen directly in brain tissue. This study, involving people with every form of MS, will help us to under-stand whether there are different pathologi- cal types of MS that may respond to thera- pies differently; The Sonya Slifka Longitudinal MS Study, tracking over 2,000 individuals with MS in 50 states over an extended period of time, is asking, among other questions, what factors determine the long-term course of MS, MS progression and disability. 13 Is the Society Researching Alternative/Complementary Treatment Models? Yes. Although the Society does not have a separate funding program for complemen- tary treatment projects, the Society's re- view process is open to any project that is related to MS, including those exploring alternative models for the cause of MS and the safety and efficacy of alternative treat- ment modalities. The Society has recently supported re- search on reflexology in pain management, Ginkgo biloba for symptomatic treatment of cognitive problems in MS, the ability of cannabis and derivatives to fight MS spas- ticity, and programs on the value of reha- bilitation and exercise programs in the treatment of MS. What is the Society Doing to Find Better Treatments for MS? We support treatment trials and laboratory studies to discover new therapies for peo- ple with MS. We also fund research into the cause, which will someday lead to a cure. We also support research into rehabilita- tion techniques in efforts to speed recovery from acute attacks and find better ways to maximize physical and mental abilities to improve day to day living and working. Well before pharmaceutical companies began pursuing the development of thera- pies for MS, the Society was supporting clinical trials in MS. Society-funded inves- tigators were the first to conduct a major clinical trial of any form of interferon in MS; we supported pre-clinical tests of what is now Copaxone, and a Society- funded investigator was among the first to investigate the potential of Novantrone in rodents with MS-like disease. The Society provided seed money to launch a network of investigators who wanted to conduct clinical studies to im-prove care and investigate new therapies, including those of little or no interest to drug companies. The group, called MS-CORE, includes over 85 sites in the U.S. and Canada. What Clinical Studies is the Society Supporting? The Society has over $6 million committed to support clinical studies in MS. Recent clinical trials we've supported include: A Phase III trial comparing oral versus IV steroids to speed recovery from acute attacks of MS; A controlled trial of the ability of canna- bis to treat MS spasticity, taking place at the University of California, Davis; Phase I clinical trials at the University of California at Los Angeles to test safety and preliminary effectiveness of the pregnancy hormone estriol in women with different forms of MS and testosterone in men with relapsing MS; A comparison study of stimulants for MS-related fatigue and cognitive prob- lems; Basic vs. Applied Research 45% of Society-funded projects focus on humans or human tissues. The remainder focus on fundamental cell biology, tissue culture tools and animal models that can shed light on normal functions and on disease states mimicking MS. 14 Phase I trials of several different experi- mental \"peptide\" therapies; A phase II clinical trial at the University of Southern California that tested T-cell vaccination in secondary-progressive MS; A phase II trial of Rituxumab, an im-mune-based experimental therapy for relapsing-remitting MS; A trial at the University of Wisconsin testing whether eating the eggs of a harmless worm can a lter immune activ- ity in MS; A study tracking whether the steroid methylprednisolone can protect brain tissue integrity in MS. Every year brings us closer to ending the devastating effects of MS. But we will not rest until we have an actual cure for every form of the disease. How Does the Society Stimulate MS Research? From the beginning, the National MS Soci- ety has funded research seeking clues to the cause, treatment and cure of MS, and to spark research efforts around the world: Increasing Federal Research Spending: In 1950 the National MS So- ciety successfully convinced the U.S. Congress to create a ne w national institute devoted to neurologi cal and related dis- eases. What is now the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke was born, becoming partners with the Society in supporting basic and clinical research into MS. Worldwide Network: In 1967, Society founder Sylvia Lawry established what is now the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation, a worldwide association of nearly 40 organizations devoted to carry-Some Discoveries From Society Funding As the largest private sponsor of MS research in the world, the National MS Society has facilitated many of the sig- nificant discoveries that shape our un- derstanding of MS today. These in-clude: Steroids can speed recovery from attacks First animal studies of Copaxone, Novantrone and Tysabri First major trial of any form of interferon Exercise can improve fatigue T cells & B cells are players in the immune attack in MS Myelin repair occurs naturally in some brain lesions Nerve fibers are damaged, even early Adult brains store cells ready to replace damaged myelin Sex hormones, peptides, growth fac- tors, combinations of approved drugs hold promise Immune cells against myelin can also react to viruses and bacteria: clue to MS trigger? Improved/speedier diagnosis Recognition of sex differences in MS Cognition, depression, fatigue are major MS symptoms 15 ing on important MS research and services. In 2000, the Society committed substantial support to MSIF's Sylvia Lawry Centre. One goal of the Centre is to collect and analyze data from major natural history studies and clinical trials of treatments for MS to create \"virtual\" placebo groups - statistical por- traits that researchers could use to more quickly evaluate new MS therapies. Other projects of international scope are The MS Lesion Project (see box, page 9), in-volving collaborators in the U.S., Austria and Germany who are studyi ng damaged areas in MS brain tissue for clues to what may be dif- ferent causes of MS, an d the Nervous System Repair and Protection initiative (see box, page 9) involving four international teams of investigators. MS Research Centers Foster Teams to Fight MS Collaborative MS Research Centers combine th e expertise of top MS researchers with scientists outside the field of MS who are us ing cutting-edge technolo gies to engage in large scale explorations to speed the search for a cure. The National MS Society is fund- ing 11 of these five-year, $825,000 Centers wh ich allow for flexible spending by multi- disciplinary teams based at the sa me or separate institutions. Cleveland Clinic \u2014 Bruce D. Trapp, PhD, and colleagues, who are attempting to stimulate cells that can genera te new myelin damaged by MS. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute \u2014 Charles D. Stiles, PhD, is leading an investigation into strategies for repairing the damage to nerve-insulating myelin that occurs in MS. Harvard Medical School \u2014 David A.

This program has trained many of the country's leading MS investigators, and ensures that top-notch minds will always be focused on the prob- lems of MS until a cure is found. Seed Money: The National MS Soci- ety often plants research \"seeds\" from which great things grow. Long before pharmaceutical companies became inter-ested, the Society was supporting clinical trials of drugs to treat MS. For example, one of the earliest grants the Society gave, in 1950, was to conduct preliminary tests of the steroid ACTH in MS. This drug proved (with Society funding) to be the first to speed recovery from MS exacerba- tions. We also support basic research and early, preclinical and clinical tests that can lead to the development of new therapies. Cross-Fertilization: MS involves di- verse fields: basic and clinical immunol-ogy, neurophysiology, virology, genetics, rehabilitation, and many others. To foster cross-fertilization of ideas among re- searchers from differ ent realms, the Soci- ety supports scientific workshops on rele- vant topics. Over the years, many of these workshops have been springboards for crucial leaps forward in our approach to MS. For exam- ple, a workshop held in Nice, France in 2002 led directly to the Society's $15.6 million initiative to support collaborative teams searching for ways to protect and repair the nervous system in MS. In 2002, the Societ y launched a Collabo- rative MS Research Center program (see box, page 15) to further stimulate interac-tion of researchers from diverse fields and to attract new scientis ts to MS research. Harvesting New Ideas: Since 1987, the Society has used special pilot research grants to cultivate novel or high-risk re- search ideas and attract new investigators to the field of MS (see box, page 6). These low-cost, short-term awards allow quick determinations as to whether a new idea merits full-scale exploration. Are We Making Progress in Finding the Cause of MS? Yes, a great deal of progress is being made. (See \"We've Come a Long Way...\", next page, and Timeline, pages 18-19.) Al- though MS is not hereditary or contagious, it is believed to occur in genetically sus-ceptible people who are exposed to an in- fectious agent, such as a virus or bacte- rium. These factors ma y combine to cause the person's immune system to attack mye-lin insulation on nerve fibers. In the 1970s, the immunological nature of the disease began to be clarified, an area of research that continues to evolve and move forward rapidly. In the mid-1980s, with the advent of magnetic resonance im-aging (MRI), the first \"picture\" of the dam- age done by MS in the brain and spinal cord became possible, and MR technology continues to grow in sophistication and in its application in MS, both in terms of un- derstanding the pathology of MS and in terms of efficient means of testing new treatments. Only in the early 1990s was genetic technology evolved to the point where \"whole genome\" screens of indi-viduals with complex, multi-gene diseases 17 like MS, became possible. In 2005 research- ers created a \"Haplotype Map\" which Society investigators are now applying to the search for MS genes. Society-supported research has contributed to our current understanding of the complex cause of MS. The actual neurological signs and symptoms of MS are generated by dys-function in the conduction of nerve signals, a consequence of immune -mediated damage to insulation around nerve fibers, and to the nerve fibers themselves, throughout the brain and spinal cord. This basic understanding of MS has led to new treatments that control immune function and to experimental therapies that may pro- tect brain tissues or enhance nerve fiber conduction even in th e face of immune- mediated damage. Research into how damaged tissue may be repaired, replaced and protected is now gath-ering momentum and offers new areas for therapeutic intervention. Investigators are also harnessing new tools, such as gene-chip technology and new MRI-based imaging techniques, in the fight against MS. These technologies are allowing researchers to re- visit age-old questions about this disease in exciting new ways, and may lead to answers that will allow doctors to stop the immune attack and ultimately, re pair tissue damage to restore function in individuals with MS.
