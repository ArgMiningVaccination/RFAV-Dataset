Design and evaluation of information retrieval systems 2. Biomedical informatics education for health care, biomedical research, and informatics professionals 3. Re-use of electronic health record data 4. Informatics workforce characterization and training Biographical Statement William Hersh, MD is a Professor in the Department of Medical Informatics & Clinical Epidemiology (DMICE) in the School of Medicine at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) in Portland, Oregon, USA. Dr. Hersh served as the inaugural Chair of DMICE from 2003-2022 and as Head of its predecessor free-standing Division of Medical Informatics & Outcomes Research from 1997-2003. He is a leader and innovator in biomedical informatics both in education and research. Dr. Hersh's main research efforts are in the area of information retrieval (also known as search) applied to biomedicine. He has authored over 200 scientific papers and abstracts as well as the book, Information Retrieval: A Health and Biomedical Perspective, 4th Edition (Springer, 2020). His current work focuses on the application of search techniques to electronic health record data, aiming to improve patient cohort discovery and amplification of signals of rare diseases. His research activities have also included conducting systematic reviews of the efficacy of informatics interventions, including telemedicine and health information exchange. He has also investigated the quantity and characteristics of the workforce needed to implement health information technology, especially in clinical settings. Dr. Hersh is also a leader in informatics education. He serves as Director of OHSU's Biomedical Informatics Graduate Program, which is one of the oldest and largest in the world, and has awarded nearly 1000 Master's and PhD degrees as well as a Graduate Certificates. He also spearheaded OHSU's efforts in distance learning for biomedical informatics. He also has served as PI since 2002 of OHSU's National Library of Medicine (NLM) T15 Training Grant, which is the largest and second-oldest training grant at OHSU. Dr. Hersh has led a number of innovations in biomedical informatics education. He conceptualized and implemented the first offering of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) 10x10 (\"ten by ten\") program, which has been completed by over 3000 people. Some of these innovations have been funding by grants. These grants include funding from the National Institutes of Health 4 (NIH) Fogarty International Center in its Informatics Training for Global Health initiative, the US Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) to develop national curricula for health IT, the NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) program to develop open educational resources in biomedical data science, the NIH Data Science Initiative for Africa, and the NIH Bridge2AI Program. He is Editor of the introductory textbook, Health Informatics: Practical Guide, 8th Edition (Lulu.com, 2022), which has an associated Web site. Dr. Hersh has also been active in the development of the physician subspecialty of clinical informatics. He was among the first cohort of physicians to be certified in the new subspecialty in 2013. He also has been the Course Director of the AMIA Clinical Informatics Board Review Course (CIBRC) since its inception. He also served as the Founding Program Director of OHSU's Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited Clinical Informatics Fellowship. Dr. Hersh has won numerous awards for his innovations. These include the OHSU Faculty Senate Distinguished Faculty Award for outstanding teaching in 2007, the 2008 AMIA Donald A.B. Lindberg Award for Innovation in Informatics, the 2015 Healthcare Information Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Physician Leadership Award, and the 2022 AMIA William W. Stead Award for Thought Leadership in Informatics. Dr. Hersh is an elected fellow of several honorific societies, including the American College of Physicians (FACP), the American College of Medical Informatics (FACMI), the International Academy of Health Science Informatics (FIAHSI - founding Fellow), and American Medical Informatics Association (FAMIA - inaugural Fellow). He is also an Elected Member of the ACM Special Interest Group in Information Retrieval (SIGIR) Academy. Dr. Hersh obtained his B.S. in Biology from the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana in 1980 and his M.D. from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1984. After finishing a residency in Internal Medicine at University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago in 1987, he completed a Fellowship in Medical Informatics at Harvard University in 1990.
