There is no longer a testing option. This rule effects all OBCE licensees and healthcare staff.

Governor Brown announced today that the vaccination requirement for healthcare workers (which includes all OBCE licensees) will no longer have a testing alternative. Healthcare workers will be required to be fully vaccinated by October 18 or six weeks after full FDA approval, whichever is later. The Oregon Health Authority (OHA) is working to amend its temporary rule ( [OAR 333-019-1010](https://secure.sos.state.or.us/oard/viewSingleRule.action?ruleVrsnRsn=280246)) and we will provide it to our licensees once finalized. Governor Brown's press conference is available here: [Two New Vaccination Measures to Address Hospital Crisis, Help Keep Students Safe](/newsroom/Pages/NewsDetail.aspx?newsid=64283) For questions regarding OHA's temporary rule and these requirements, contact OHA at [COVID.10@dhsoha.state.or.us](mailto:COVID.10@dhsoha.state.or.us) or 503-945-5488. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ 08/06/2021 Oregon Health Authority (OHA)'s Final Temporary Administrative Rule re: COVID-19 vaccinations and weekly testing On 08/05/2021, the OHA filed its final temporary administrative rule, [OAR 333-019-1010](https://secure.sos.state.or.us/oard/viewSingleRule.action?ruleVrsnRsn=280246), that requires healthcare personnel and healthcare staff who work in healthcare settings to either be vaccinated against COVID-19 or be tested for COVID-19 on at least a weekly basis. Additionally, it requires employers of healthcare providers or healthcare staff to have and follow policies for requesting and obtaining proof of vaccination, requiring COVID-19 testing for those not vaccinated or who have an unknown vaccination status, on at least a weekly basis, and maintaining documentation of weekly COVID-19 test results for any healthcare provider or healthcare staff person who is unvaccinated or has an unknown vaccination status. If a healthcare provider is self-employed, the healthcare provider must maintain their own documentation of vaccination or weekly COVID-19 test results. Such documentation must be maintained for at least two years and must be provided to OHA upon request. \\ These requirements are effective as of September 30, 2021. Those who violate any provision of the rule will be subject to civil penalties of $500 per day per violation, imposed by the OHA. OBCE licensees (chiropractic physicians and certified chiropractic assistants) fall within OHA's definition of \"healthcare providers and healthcare staff.\" Chiropractic clinics or offices, in addition to any multi-disciplinary clinics, fall within OHA's definition of \"healthcare setting.\" The rule is silent as to who/what entity is responsible for costs associated with this rule. To be clear, this rule is promulgated and enforceable by OHA. To date, the OBCE has not taken any action or initiated any rulemaking with regard to these requirements. If you have questions about this rule, please seek independent legal counsel or contact OHA directly: [COVID.19@dhsoha.state.or.us](mailto:COVID.19@dhsoha.state.or.us).

The rule requires weekly COVID-19 testing for personnel in health care settings to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in health care settings, which can be waived with a proof of vaccination. The new rule will be issued this week and the requirement to be vaccinated or undergo weekly testing will apply starting September 30, 2021. The new rule applies to personnel in health care settings who have direct or indirect contact with patients or infectious materials. Governor Brown's statement and video can be found here: [New Health and Safety Rule Announcement](https://mailchi.mp/oregon/news-releasegovernor-kate-brown-announces-new-health-and-safety-rule-for-employees-in-health-care-settings-to-help-prevent-delta-variant-spread?e=9cb5cfb484) [New Health and Safety Rule Video Announcement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rnMPuJK-VctIgKuwUJbIZ67J2a_nTonK/view) We will update our licensees with the OHA rule and any other guidance once they are available. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Public Notice regarding facial covering requirements Facial coverings are still required in healthcare settings under OHA, OSHA, and [OAR 811-035-0007](https://secure.sos.state.or.us/oard/viewSingleRule.action?ruleVrsnRsn=276158). Chiropractic clinics are considered healthcare offices and chiropractic physicians are considered healthcare personnel. ( [OHA Mask, Face Covering, and Face Shield Requirements for Health Care Offices](https://sharedsystems.dhsoha.state.or.us/DHSForms/Served/le2351m.pdf), June 30, 2021) How did the OBCE come to this conclusion? [Executive Order 21-15](/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_21-15.pdf) extended the emergency declaration originally found in [Executive Order 20-03](/gov/admin/Pages/eo_20-03.aspx) while also rescinding statewide mask mandates and other protective restrictions. However, enhanced COVID-19 precautions are still necessary in specific specialized settings such as healthcare, public transportation, and correctional facilities. OHA Mask, Face Covering, and Face Shield Requirements for Healthcare Offices, June 30, 2021, states, \"While the Governor has rescinded many of the Executive Orders, the declaration of emergency remains in effect and masks are still required in healthcare settings. See Executive Order 21-15. In addition, healthcare offices must continue to follow all applicable state and federal regulatory requirements related to masking, including [Oregon-OSHA](https://osha.oregon.gov/OSHARules/adopted/2021/ao5-2021-letter-cov19-allworkplaces.pdf) rules addressing COVID-19 workplace risks.\" These requirements apply to all health care personnel and healthcare offices and all patients and visitors in healthcare offices. The OBCE, during its regular July board meeting, deliberated on whether the facial covering rule, [OAR 811-035-0007](https://secure.sos.state.or.us/oard/viewSingleRule.action?ruleVrsnRsn=276158) (Facial Covering Requirements), is still in effect and applicable in light of the provisions within Executive Order 21-15. After considering all public comments submitted, the OBCE determined that the rule is still in effect and applicable due to the declared state of emergency being extended until December 31, 2021. Because the declared state of emergency has been extended by [Executive Order 21-15](/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_21-15.pdf), [OAR 811-035-0015](https://secure.sos.state.or.us/oard/viewSingleRule.action?ruleVrsnRsn=276156)(27) (Unprofessional Conduct in the Chiropractic Profession), still requires licensees' compliance with OHA guidance. The OBCE voted to enter rulemaking in September 2021, to consider amending [OAR 811-035-0007](https://secure.sos.state.or.us/oard/viewSingleRule.action?ruleVrsnRsn=276158) Facial Covering Requirements and [OAR 811-035-0015](https://secure.sos.state.or.us/oard/viewSingleRule.action?ruleVrsnRsn=276156) Unprofessional Conduct in the Chiropractic Profession. The OBCE will provide notice for submission of public comment in due course. Updated 7/22/2021 ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ On July 27, 2021, the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) released recommendations based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) new guidance, also issued on 7/27/21, that everyone, including fully vaccinated persons, wear a mask in public indoor settings. \"OHA's recommendation applies statewide, and not just in areas with higher infections and high transmission, as cases have increased across the state in recent weeks due to the Delta variant.\" - Updated 07/28/2021 [OHA July 27, 2021 News Release](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/ORDHS/bulletins/2ea4ad0) ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ The Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners (OBCE) invites public comment on COVID-19 related topics below.
