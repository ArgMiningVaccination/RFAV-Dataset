Response to Information Request 1.5. (CIAR #251). Comments from Jillian Lynn Lawson. (CIAR #282). from the Livingstone #288). Comments from Allan Garbutt. (CIAR #290). Information Request (IR) 1.5 (CIAR #251), Benga provided a wind speed frequency distribution table (Table 1.5-2) for the four (4) meteorologic al stations considered in the project assessment. The two on-site stations were only operational for a short period of time, and the 2 metre measurement heights may limit the representativeness of the data collected. The Environment and Climate Change Cana da (ECCC) Crowsnest station located in Coleman, AB is likely the nearest meteorological station to the proposed project location. Benga summarized 5-years of wind data (2010 to 2014) and indicated a maximum wind speed of 52 km/hr. The maximum wind speed presented appears to be an hourly average measured at the station and not instantaneous gust speeds. Although Benga has provided consideration of the maximum average wind speed, Benga has not addressed concerns relating to high (gust) wind speed events. In addition, Benga responded to IR 1.5 (CIAR #251), with a discussion regarding high wind speeds, and its effect on wind blown dust and coal loading/unloading operations. With respect to wind blown dust, Benga utilized a U.S. EPA AP-42 emission factor to calcu late the wind driven total suspended particulates from active areas of operation (aggregate pits, overburden stripping, unpaved haul roads, stockpiles). The emission factor does not directly correlate to wind speed, but rather the frequency of time where wind speeds are greater than 5.36 m/s. For the purposes of their calculations, Benga assumed wind speeds were greater than 5.36 m/s, 100% of the time. Benga also noted that this assumption does not consider mitigative circumstances such as precipitation, vegetation coverage, and crust formations. Benga indicated that wind blown emissions were conservatively accounted for, and the emission factor calculation results in the maximum emissions estimate. Further, Benga referenced the inverse relationship of C=Q/U (C is predicted concentration, Q is emission rate, U is wind speed), where the higher the wind speed, the higher the dilution factor. For loading/unloading operations, Benga also used a U.S. EPA AP-42 emission factor. Benga, in its modelin g assessment, assumed a mean wind speed of 3.9 m/s. Benga indicated that if the wind speed was doubled, dust emissions would increase by 21.3 or approximately 250%. Benga again referenced the inverse relationship of C=Q/U, which suggests that the co ncentration of dust will decrease with increased wind speed. Benga stated that due to dilution, the reported 250% increase in dust emissions would result in a net increase in concentration of only about 50%. While the U.S. EPA AP-42 emission factors are the commonly accepted practice of estimating dust emissions from mining BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 2 operations, the inverse relationship of C=Q/U may be an oversimplification of particulate dispersion. Members of the public (CIAR #282, #288, and #290), suggested that Benga did not sufficiently address concer ns relating to evaluation of high wind speed events and the potential effect on dust transport in the region. Comments also indicated that Benga did not consider peak (gust) wind speed events, nor full magnitude of wind blown particulate emissions. The information requested below is required in order to complete the following: Terms of Reference, Section 4.1.2 [B]: \"Identify stages or elements of the project that are sensitive to changes or variability in climate parameters, including frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Discuss what impacts changes to climate parameters may have on elements of the project that are sensitive to climate parameters.\" a)Provide a detailed summary of Crowsnest and Beaver Mine wind data for the most recent 10-years of available data, including maximum wind gust speeds. Include tabulated statistical summaries and graphical representations of average and gust wind speeds. Response: Summaries of wind data from the most recent 10 years at Crowsnest and Beaver Mine are provided below. For reference, the location of the two wind stations are shown in Figure 6.1-1. The anemometers are located 10 m above ground level. Daily Maximum Wind Gust According to the American Meteorological Society, in U.S. weather observing practic e ( http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Gust), gusts are reported when the peak wind speed reaches at least 16 knots (about 30 km/h) and the variation in wind speed betwee n the peaks and lulls is at least 9 knots (about 17 km/h). The duration of a gust is us ually less than 20 seconds. Hourly maximum wind gust data are not available from Environment Climate Change Canada (ECCC); therefore, daily maximum gust wind speeds are summarized. Daily maximum wind gust data ( i.e., the highest 20-second wind speed in ea ch day) at Crowsnest and Beaver Mines stations for the most recent 10 years were downloaded from the ECCC website ( https://climate.weather.gc.ca/ ). ECCC indi cates that wind character and wind gust speed are acquired at a height of 10 m ( https://climate.we ather.gc.ca/doc/Technical_Documentation.pdf ). Daily maximum gust data at Beaver Mines station is available beginning in 2012. Figure 6.1-2 shows the overall frequency distribution of daily maximum gust and Figure 6.1-3 shows seasonal variation of daily m aximum gust at the two stations. Figures 6.1-4 and 6.1-5 show the wind rose for each site, showing the direction from which the maximum wind gust BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 3 speed blew. Tables 6.1-1 and 6.1-2 summarize the counts of daily maximum gust in each month of year at Crows nest and Beaver Mines stations, respectively. The figures and tables indicate the following: Daily maximum wind gusts above 30 km/h occurre d frequently at the 10 m level. The occurrence of daily maximum gust above 80 km/h is less than 1.5% at Crowsnest and 3.7% at Beaver Mines stations. Median gusts are higher during the summer month and lower in winter months. Daily maximum gusts are strongest in January at both stations. Gusts are channelled along the valley as evidenced by WNW winds at the Crowsneststation and SW winds at Beaver Mines (which is in a different valley system) .

The seasonal variation in wind speed is like that for wind gusts, indicating the highest hourly average wind speeds are associated with the highest gust wind speeds. The hourly average wind rose for Crowsnest ( Figure 6.1-8) has more winds from the SE than the gust wind rose ( Figure 6.1 -4). Table 6.1-3 summar izes the maximum gust and hourly wind speeds at the two ECCC climate stations for the most recent 10 years of available data. It indicates that wind gusts are about twice the hourly average wind speeds at Crowsnest and about 1.5 times higher at Be aver Min es.

Response: Wind-blown dust as discussed in response to part a) refers to dust blowing from surfaces. These surfaces could be the pit area, a haul road, or a storage pile. U.S. EPA (2006) states \"Dust emissions may be generated by wind erosion of open aggregate storage piles and exposed areas within an industrial facility. These sources typically are characterized by nonhomogeneous surfaces impregnated with non- erodible elements (particles larger than approximately 1 centimeter [cm] in diameter). Field testing of coal p iles and other exposed materials using a portable wind tunnel has shown that (a) threshold wind speeds exceed 5 meters per second (m/s) (11 miles per hour [mph]) at 15 cm above the surface ..., and (b) particulate emission rates tend to decay rapidly (half-life of a few minutes) during an erosion event. In other words, these aggregate material surfaces are characterized by finite availability of erodible material (mass/area) referred to as the erosion potential.\" The calculation of wind-blown dust by Environment Canada (2011) references the threshold speed of 19.3 km/h (5.4 m/s) for particulate in the PM 2.5, PM 10 and TSP size ranges. Below this speed, no emissions occur. Above it, emissions occur while erosion potential remains. At higher speeds, no furthe r emissions in these size ranges occur although it would be expected that coarser BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 6 particles could become airborne at higher speeds. Emissions are not continuous - after the first gusts elevate the material, no further emission occurs unti l additional mate rial settles to the surface. For overburden and road-bed material, the threshold speed for creating additional wind-blown dust is about 21 m/s (76 km/h) and 27 m/s (97 km/h), respectively (U.S. EPA 2006). The threshold for an uncrusted coal pile is 23 m/s (83 km/h). The effect of wind gusts in generating additional wind-blown dust from overburden and road-bed material was estimated by comparing the frequency of wind gusts above these thresholds. The frequency of wind gusts for the Projec t was estimated w ith two approaches: By examining the maximum observed wind gust in each day, from Figure 6.1-2. By assuming a gust to one-hour average wind speed ratio of 2, from Table 6.1-3. Maximum Observed Daily Wind Gust Table 6.1-4 shows, using observed wind gusts at Crowsnest and Beaver Mine in Figure 6.1-2, for a variety of surface types, the maximum frequency of wind-blown dust generation is less than 6% of days. Table 6.1-4 Frequency of Potential Wind- Blown Dust Generation by Material Type - Daily Max Gust Crowsnest Win ds Beaver Mines Winds Overburden (76 (97 km/h) 0.03% 0.4% Gust to Mean Ratio Using a gust to mean wind speed ratio of 2 at both sites, from Table 6.1-3, the frequency of hourly gusts based on hourly mean speeds in Figure 6.1-6 was estimated. To do this, the wind speed in each speed range was doubled. For example, at Beaver Mines, the mean wind category 40-60 km/h had a frequency of 2%. Therefore, for t he assessment, it was estimated the gust category of 80-120 km/h also had a frequency of 2%. Table 6.1- 5 summarizes these results.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 7 Table 6.1-5 Frequency of Potential Wind- Blown Dust Generation by Material Type - Gust from Mean Speed Crowsn est Winds Beav er Mines Winds Overburden (97 km/h) 0.01% Dust Generation The considerations in modelling wind-blown dust are: Wind speed increases with height above ground depending on atmospheric stability and roughness of the surface. Using the information in U.S. EPA (2006), a threshold wind speed of 5 to 5.4 m/s at a height of 15 cm corresponds to a speed of roughly 10-11 m/s (36-40 km/h) at 10 m abo ve ground where standard winds are measured. EC stations document hourly mean wind speed and the daily maximum wind gust. Thegust to mean wind speed ratio (called the gust factor) ranges from about 1.5 to 2.3 at thetwo EC sites. The assessment used a g ust factor of 2 . Model winds provided by AEP are 1-hour averages. Model winds do not include gusts. To account for gusts, the model approach was to apply the 5.4 m/s threshold speed for fine dust generation to winds at 10 m rather than at 15 cm above ground. Using a gust factor of 2, this corresponds to a gust of about 10.8 m/s at a height of 10 m above ground. In effect, whenever the model winds gust above 10.8 m/s (about 38 km/h),wind -blown dust can be generated. The U.S. EPA notes particulate emission rates tend to decay rapidly (half- life of a few minutes) during an erosion event. Higher winds above the threshold wind speed do notgenerate more dust in the PM 2.5 to TSP size range. The pool of dust available for transport is limited by the half-life, but the mode l assumes the dust pool is unlimited. In the model, a threshold velocity of 5.4 m/s (about 20 km/h) was applied to 10- m CALMET winds and all surface types. Furthermore, the erosion potential was unlimited - the model assumed that the surfaces were disturb ed every hour to create new fine material for erosion. According to Figure 6.1-10, wind-blown dust was generated 19- 24% of the time in the mine operations area. In other words, the model generated wind-blown dust at the mine site substantially more often than either of the frequency estimates in Tables 6.1 -4 and 6.1-5. The implication for the Project is that the model has not under- estimated the frequency of occurrence of wind-blown dust, i.e., is conservative from this perspective. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 8 Implications for Cli mate Change As documented in Section 5.14.2 of CR#1 (EIA, CR#1, Section 5.14.2, CIAR#42), wind-blown dust emissions are expected at all stages of the project - construction, operations and reclamation. It is expected climate change would affect the latter stages of the Project. Under global warming, the severity and frequency of future wind gust events could be expected to change later this century. Cheng et al. (2014) modelled the frequency of future wind gusts across Canada for two different emission sc enarios and documented results (Figure 6.1-11) for Lethbridge, which has a higher frequency of wind gusts than other locations in the region. By 2065, the frequency of hourly winds above 28 km/h (roughly the threshold for fine wind-blown dust) could increase by 10- 13% (considering the first and third bars in the bottom left Lethbridge chart corresponding to 2065). In Cheng et al. (2014), the highest increase for 70 km/h winds (roughly the gust threshold for overburden) is about 60%, which would increase the highest frequency in Table 6.1-5 to 5%. The frequency of future daily max gusts over 70 km/h increases by up to 40%, increasing the highest value in Table 6.1 -4 to about 8%. These increased frequencies (5%, 8%) are within the envelope of 19-24% dust generation frequency predicted by application of the model. Adaptative Management for Dust Mitigation The above discussion on wind-blown dust generation is based on air quality and climate model predictions, and on regional Environment Canada wind measureme nts. Benga has also committed to monitoring airborne particulate associated with its operations and has developed a draft Air Quality Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan (as provided in Addendum 10, JRP IR -1.3, CIAR#251). The specific mitigation measu res in Section 5 of that plan that apply to wind-blown dust in all phases of operation are: Trees and bushes will be preserved around mines, plant and loadout, because they effectively trap dust emissions from construction and operations activities downwind of sources. Trees and bushes downwind of dust sources also reduce wind speed in theirwake, which leads to increased dust deposition by removing it from the atmosphere. Trees and bushes upwind of emission sources also reduce wind speeds in their wake,which would reduce the generation of wind-blown dust at source. Envirobind DCT (as discussed in Addendum 10, JRP IR -1.1, CIAR#251) will be applied at the loadout to reduce wind -blown emissions of coal dust from rail cars during transport. A range of other practices also reduce the potential for wind -blown dust generation, including the application of dust suppressant to haul road and plant area surfaces, enclosing the rail loadout and conveyors, and maintaining snow cover on surfaces in winter. Prompt reclamation and revegetation will reduce wind -blown emissions at end of life. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 9 Section 7 of the Plan (Addendum 10, JRP IR-1.3, Appendix 1.3-1, CIAR#251) identifies the factors that will be considered as part of adaptive management, based on the success of the proposed mitigation measures. The factors that directly affect wind -blown dust include varying water rates, alternative dust suppressants, and planting additional vegetation. c)Substantiate and rationalize the emission factor used for wind blown dust calculations; and whether or not the threshold of 5.36 m/s is representative of dust emissions even at extreme wind speeds. Response: In Benga's response to Information Request 1.5. (Addendum 10, JRP IR -1.5, CIAR#251), the U.S. EPA emission equation for wind-blown dust was provided. The method used to estimate wind driven emissions is derived from the fugitive emissions discuss ion in the Air & Waste Management Association (AWMA) Air Pollution Engineering Manual (AWMA 1992). The same method is recommended by NP I (2012) for Australian mines. The value of 5.36 m/s is suggested in both documents as the threshold velocity for wind-driven emissions from coal stockpiles, where the speed is measured at the surface and, as indicated in the response to b) above, is the same threshold used by Environment Canada. Appendix A to CR#1 (EIA, CR#1, CIAR#42) noted that the threshold speed typically corresponds to a 10- m wind speed of about 11 m/s. d) Evaluate the applicability of the simple relationship of C=Q/U in the complex terrain which the proposed project is located in. Provide any other rationale and applicable references to justify the applicability of the C=Q/U relationship used. Response: Using a Gaussian plume approach ( e.g., from https://www.eng.uwo.ca/people/esavory/Gaussian%20plumes.pdf), the concentration at any point at ground level along the centerline of a plume is given by: (, 0,0 )= 1 2 22 To further simplify, when the source height (H) is surface based, the equation becomes: (, 0,0 )= 1 This relationship illustrates that, other things being equal, when emission rates (Q) double, the predicted concentration (C) doubles. Similarly, when wind speed (U) doubles, the predicted BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 10 concentratio n becomes one- half the original value. The plume dime nsions ('s) may be constrained in valley situations but the simple relationship remains valid where the plume width is less than the valley width. This would be the case for the Project analysis. REFERENCES: Air & Waste Management Association (AWMA). 19 92. Air Pollution Engineering Manual. Anthony J. Buonicore and Wayne T Davies (eds).

Response to Information Request 3.4. (CIAR #251) Public Lands Ac t. Public Lands Administration Regulation . Alberta Regulation 187/2011, Section 9(1)(e), p. 19. The Public Lands Act application process requires applicants to obtain a public land standing report (PL SR) in order to identify the existing land occupants and interests on the public land subject to the application. Section 9(1)(e) of the Public Lands Administration Regulat ion specifies that an application for a disposition \"must, if the application relate s to public land that is already the subject of a disposition under the Act or a timber disposition, be accompanied with a statement of consent, in a form acceptable to the director, that is signed by the disposition holder or timber disposition holder\". The process also requires that consent is included in an application where the lands are subject to an existing reservation or notation that requires consent. In response to IR 3.4 (CIAR #251), Benga provided some consents, however there are still required consents that remain outstanding. In addition, some of the information provided by Benga are not consents, but simply the notifications that were sent to the land occupants. In certain circumstances, notifications and responses did not include appropriat e disposition numbers, therefore confirmation of notification adequacy cannot be confirmed. In order to comply with Section 9(1)(e) of the Public Lands Administration Regulation , Benga is required to review the Public Land Standing Report and all comment s associated with each entry and provide the following information: a)Submit a complete package of all required consents and clearances from the existing occupants and r eservations/notations identified in the report; and Response: On December 6, 2019, O sler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP (Osler) on behalf of Benga submitted a letter to the Joint Review Panel (JRP) respectfully requesting that the JRP reconsider and rescind JRP IR-6.2 ( CIAR#300), based on the rationale that the legislative regime in Alberta is cl ear in that Benga is not required to obtain all consents prior to a public interest determination being made. On January 20, 2020, the JRP issued a response letter rescinding JRP IR-6.2 ( CIAR#306); however, the JRP stated that if consents required by the relevant legislation are not provided by the close of the hearing, even if all other requirements are met, the JRP will not be able to issue dispositions in relation to applications where those consents are required. The necessary BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 12 consents from Alberta En vironment and Parks relating to work towards obtaining the necessary consents. b)Submit all conse nts and notifications and include the appropriate disposition identifications.

Consultant Report #11 -Socio -Economic Impact. (CIAR #42). Grassy Mountain Coal Project Updated Environmental Impact Assessment. Section E - SocioEconomic. (CEAR #42). Fifth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. Response to Information Request 68. (CIAR #69) Tenth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. Response to Information Request 3.6. (CIAR #251) Comments from the Coalition of Alberta Wilderness A ssociation and Grassy Mountain Group, and Shirley Kirby (\"the Coalition\"). (CIAR #278) In the Environmental Impact Assessment, Section E, Benga stated that the \"Project will also contribute an estimated $140 million (NPV 2015) and $210 million (NPV 2015) to provincial and federal corporate income taxes respectively as well as approximately $195 million (NPV 2015) in provincial royalties over the 23-year operating life of the project assuming a $140 /tonne average real price of coal\". (CIAR #42). These ates are based on Benga's price forecast of $140 USD /tonne average real price of metallurgical coal. In response to IR 3.6 (CIAR #251), Benga provided estimates for provincial and federal income taxes based on price scenarios of US$100/tonne and US$200/tonne. In its response to IR 68 (CIAR #69), Benga stated that it \"considers $140/tonne is a reasonable long- term price for planning purposes\", but did not specify whether it also relied on independent external price forecasts. Elsewhere in that response, Benga proposed $100/tonne and $200/tonne forecasts in response to the request to produce royalty forecasts using both low and high price scenarios. Benga reported these economic benefits in 2015 dollars (Consultant Report 11, CIAR #42). Benga has not provided an update on whether the benefit estimates may have changed since they were originally calculated. The Coalition (CIAR #278) r aised questions about the potential economic benefits of the project and asked for independent validation of Benga's price foreca st. The Panel would like to better understand the latest projected benefit estimates. The information requested below is required in order to complete the following: Terms of Reference, Section 8.2 [A] a. ii): \"Describe the socio -economic impacts of projec t construction and operation, including ... impacts on the Regional and provincial economies\". a)Confirm whether the stated metallurgical coal price forecast of $140/tonne is supported by independent external price forecasts and, if so, submit this supportingBENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 14 information. Provide information on any credible external price forecasts for metallurgical coal that differ significantly from Benga's price forecast. Response: Benga maintains that the current long -term metallurgical coal price forecasts more or less correspond with its stated value of $140 USD/tonne. Since the initial economic review, the long- term forecasts for metallurgical coal prices have held a tight range, very close to the projected $140 USD/tonne. This is supported by the following extract from independent experts Wood Mackenzie. This example is from the recent Wood Mackenzie report entitled, \"Global Metallurgical Coal Long -Term Outlook H2 2019: Future Brings Indian Order After China Chaos\" in which they state: \" We think long -term prices wil l need to sit above US$150/t in real terms in order to meet our demand forecasts. Prices are expected to trough one year earlier in our outlook, reaching US$133/t in 2024...Despite some variation in trends, average prices in the long term are very similar t o our previous update, reaching US$154/t in 2040.\" The Wood Macke nzie report summarizes the projected metallurgical coal price in Figure 6.3-1. Benga has received permission from Wood Mackenzie to provide the above information from the report but is not able to provide a copy of the report due to confidentiality and copyright restrictions. b) For each of the price forecast scenarios of $100/tonne, $140/tonne, and $200/tonne, provide an updated calculation of projected government revenues (federal, provincial, and municipal) from taxes and royalties over the lifetime of the project, both Net Present Value in 2019 dollars as well as average annual amounts (specify real or nominal dollars). Include key assumptions used to inform the calculations, and indicate whether any of these assumptions have changed since the original benefits estimates were produced in Consultant Report 11 (CIAR #42). Response: Key assumptions used to inform the calculation of fiscal effects include: Capital Expenditure $730 million (20 15 - no change) Annual Operating Expenditure $225 million per year (2015 - no change) Existing Alberta Coal RoyaltyStructure (no significant changes) Existing Federal and Alberta IncomeTax Structure(most significant change is reduction of Alberta income tax rate from 10% in the previous model to 8%) Exchange rate 1 CAD = 0.8 USD (reduced) BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 15 The results using the updated information are provided in the Table 6.3-1.

Using an 8% discount rate, the present value of the municipal taxes over the life of the project is estimat ed at $11.2 million (2019). c)Given that three years has passed since the socio -economic impact assessment was submitted, comment on how the projected macroeconomic impacts associated with the Project may have changed with more current data and economic m ultipliers (e.g., jobs, GDP, etc.). Response: The socio -economic conditions in the region have evolved from those character ized in the SEIA, which relied on data collected as part of the 2006 and 2011 federal census and 2011 national household survey. The following is an overview of the differences in selected indicators between the Consultant Report #11 ( EIA, CR#11, CIAR#42) and those available at the time of this writing - primarily 2016 census data. Population The historic population growth rates shown in Table 6.3-2 (formerly Table 3.1 of CR#11, EIA, CIAR#42) covered the 2001 to 2011 period. Updating these data to include 2016 census data reveal that the population in all of the communities within the RSA are decreasing as demonstrated in CR#11, albeit at a slower rate when the latest data are included. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 16 Table 6.3-2 Updated Historic Population Growth Geography 2001 2011 2016 AAGR (2001- 2011) AAGR (2001- Statistics Canada 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016. Figures rounded for presentation purposes. Labour Force The composition of the labour force as identified in Figures 3.2 and 3.3 of CR#11 (presented again here as Figure 6.3-2 and Figure 6.3-3) is ge nerally in line with the updated figures shown below. The relative concentration of the labour force in selected industries has varied slightly. For example, in the B.C. portion of the RSA, the portion of the labour force engaged in retail and accommodation has increased to surpass health care. However, the notable concentration of the RSA l abour force in the mining and oil and gas extraction industry has not changed and continues to be well above both provincial averages. The labour market conditions c haracterized in Table 3.2 of CR#11 (EIA, CIAR#42) have changed. Per Table 6.3-3: The participation rate in the Alberta portion of the RSA has increased slightly from 60.8% up to 63.1% and remains below the provincial average. The participation rate in the B.C. portion of the RSA is virtually unchanged from 68.8% and remains above the provi ncial average. The unemployment rate in both the B.C. and Alberta portions of the RSA have increased considerably - by 2.3% and 3.1% respectively.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 17 Table 6.3-3 Updated Labour Force Indicators Labour Force Indicator Alberta Portion of RSA Alberta B.C. Port ion of RSA British Columbia Labour Force Size 2,865 2,302,945 2,115 2,471,665 Participation Source: Statistics Canada 2016. The 2016 census data described in the table above represents the latest available community - specific labour force data for the RSA. More recent data are available for the economic regions that encompass the RSA and other nearby communities. However, the RSA communities represent a small fraction ( i.e., less than of the 1.5% in Alberta and 3% in B.C.) of the broader regional labour force. Accordingly, these more recent statistics are not likely to be representative of the specific conditions in RSA communities. Education The 2016 census data are consistent with the findings noted in CR#11 (EIA, CIAR#42). Specifically, the prominent role of resource extraction in the regional economy is reflected in the type of educational at tainment of RSA residents. In the Alberta portion of the RSA, the percentage of the population holding an apprenticeship or trade certificate (13.5%) is above the provincial average (9.7%). In the B.C. portion of the RSA, the percentage of the population holding an apprenticeship or trade certificate is also above the provincial average (15.8% as compared to 8.8%). In addition, high school completion in both the Alberta and B.C. RSAs are below their provincial averages. Median Household Income Table 6.3-4 provides an update to Table 3.3 in CR#11 (EIA, CIAR#42) and shows median household income from the 2016 census. The general findings contained in CR#11 hold. Specifically: household income in the Alberta portion of the RSA is below the provincial avera ge; and household income in the B.C. portion of the RSA is above the provincial average.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 18 Table 6.3-4 Updated Median Household Income Geography 2016 Ranchland $56,320 $69,995 Source: Statistics Canada 2016. Economic Effects The economic impacts described in Section 4 of CR#11 (EIA, CIAR#42) were derived using: the Alberta Finance Input-Output Model Multipliers which were published in 2015 and based on data collected in 2011; the British Columbia Provincial Economic Multipliers which were published in 2008 and based on data collected in 2004; and the 2011 Statis tics Canada Interprovincial and international trade flows. The year in which the data were collected is relevant insofar as the multipliers reflect the structure of the economy at that time. At the time of this writing, the most recent representation of the provincial economies of B.C. and Alberta is the 2016 Interprovincial Input-Output Model built and maintained by Stati stics Canada and based on data collected in 2016. The economic impacts estimated by Statistics Canada are outlined below. During construction, Project expenditures are expected to support total ( i.e., direct, indirect, and induced) GDP and labour income of approximately: $265 million and $192 million respectively in Alberta; and $70 million and $49 million respectively in B.C. Project c onstruction will also support total ( i.e., direct, indirect, and induced) employment of: 1,660 PYs in Alberta; and 475 P Ys in B.C. During operations, Project expenditures are expected to support annual total ( i.e., direct, indirect, and induced) GDP and labour income of approximately: $95 million and $62 million respectively in Alberta; and $38 million and $27 million respectively in B.C.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 19 Project operations will also support annual total ( i.e., direct, indirect, and induced) employment of: 610 PYs in Alber ta; and 250 PYs in B.C.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 20 INDIGENOUS RIGHTS, LAND USE AND CULTURE Information Request 6.4 Grassy Mountain Coal Project Updated Environmental Impact Assessment.

Response: In 2019 Benga in coordination with the respectiv e Indigenous leadership, arranged to employ and train members (with support from Bison Hi storical Services Lt d.) from the Blackfoot Nations including the Piikani, Ka inai, and Siksika Nations. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 22 The Blackfoot crew members were trained in standard and common archaeological excavation techniques from maintaining a controlled excava tion within a 1-x-1 metr e square pit, shovel shaving of soil in order to identified artifacts in -site (in place), the identi fication of artifacts and stone tools, the importance of documen ting the provenience of artifacts found in-situ , the sifting of soil to identified artifacts, and the documentati on of arbitrary 10 cm laye rs within each 1-x-1 metre square pit. These are the methods that are usually taught in a university level 6-week long archaeological field school. Prior to commencement of archeological field work, a briefing was held with the Blackfoot Nations to describe the intended program and to solicit any concerns or feedback. A ceremony on site was conducted by elders of the Blackfoot Nations prior to commencement of excavation activities. Field visits to the excavation sites were conducte d for Blackfoot Nations, Stoney Nakoda Nation, and Tsuut'ina Natio n, during the summer of 2019. Information Request 6.5 Final Environmental Impact Statement Guidelines. (CEAR #11). Information Request Package #4 from the Joint Review Panel to Benga, Information Requests 4.1 and 4.2. (CIAR #212). Tenth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. Response to Information Requests 4.1 and 4.2. (CIAR #251). The EIS Guidelines, Section 6.4 (CIAR #11) require that Benga describe mitigation measures specific to each environmental effect identified. Mitigation measures are to be written as specific commitments that clearl y describe how Benga intends to implement each mitigation measure and th e environmental outcome the mitigation is designed to address. Mitigation measures are to be specific, achievable, measurable, and verifiable, and described in a manner that avoids ambiguity in intent, interpretation, and implementation. In IRs 4.1 and 4.2 (CIAR #212), Benga was asked to provide a comp leted assessment of the effects of the Project on the current use of lands and resources for traditional purposes of Indigenous peoples. The mitiga tion measures identified throughout Benga's responses to IRs 4.1 and 4.2, as presente d in Appendix 4.1-1 and 4.2-1 (CIAR #251), are however incomplete or lack sufficient explan ation and very few have measurable criteria associated with the proposed mitigation. As an example, in Appendix 4.1-2 (CIAR #251) Benga has a mitigation listed as, \"m inimize the overall disturbance footprint through the mine planning process\" and a nother as, \"enforce a speed limit along the main access road\". These are not specific co mmitments that describe how Benga intends to implement and evaluate each mitigati on measure, nor do they describe the environmental outcome the mitiga tion is designed to address. In order to better understand the proposed mitigation measures with respect to the current use of lands and resources for traditiona l purposes and the cultural heritage of BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 23 Indigenous peoples, and whether the proposed mitigation measures are likely to be effective, the Panel requires the following information from Benga. a)Provide a table of all commitments and mitigation measures for the current use of lands and resources for traditional purpose s, and a similar, separate table for physical and cultural heritage, that Benga commits to implement, should the Project be approved. Include mitigation measures within the LSA and RSA including for specific uses, practices or activities that occur outside of the boundaries of the RSA where a potential effect of the Project may occur. The response must include the following: i.The pathway of effect that a given mitigation measure or commitment is addressing; ii.A description of the mitigation measure or commitment. Ensure that each mitigation measure is specific, achievable, measurable, and verifiable; iii.A description of how Benga will implement each mitigation measure; iv. An explanation of how the mitigation measure is meant to address the effect; v.A discussion of the anticipated effectiveness of the mitigation measures; vi.The conclusion regarding whether there are residual effects after the application of mitigation measures; and vii.Reference to the document where the commitment was made or mitigation measure was described (i.e. EIA, Addendum, Registry document number, etc.). Response: Benga has undertaken extensive engagement with Indigenous groups throughout the EIA process over the last 6 years to understand potential effects on Indigenous interests. This included: Agreements Project Agreements have been signed with most T reaty 7 First Nations and a letter of commitment has been sent to M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta. Benga iscommitted to fulfilling the terms, commitments, and additional mitigation s outlined in these agreements; the details of which are not provided here due toconfidentiality. Benga acknowledges that, despite the agreements in place, theJRP is mandated to review information on potential adverse environmental effects of the Project. Provision of Record of Consultation Logs Extensive bi- monthly consultation log s and concern and response tables have been provided to Treaty 7 First Nations for review and verification that includes engagement starting from December 15, 2014. The logs include all engagement related communication between Benga and Treaty 7 First Nations, includingBENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 24 phone calls, e -mails, and meetings. The up to date consultation logs were provided in Addendum 9 (CIAR#185). Mitigation for Project effects on the Indigenous VCs of Current Use of Lands and Resources and Indigenous Physical and Cultural He ritage has previously been provided: EIA (CIAR 2D: Mitigations and Commitments, Table 2D-1: page 15 outlines the mitigation for Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage and Traditional Land and Resource Use; EIA (CIAR #42) Section H: of Effects, pdf pgs 552-554 outline the mitigation for Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage and Traditional Land and Resource Use; Addendum 10 ( CIAR#251), Appendix 4.1.1: An Updated Assessment of the Potential Effects of the Grassy Mountain Proje ct on Indigenous Groups, by Indigenous group for Current Use of Land and Updated As sessment of the Potential Effects of the Grassy Mountain Project on Indigenous Groups, by Indigenous group for Physical and Cultural 4.1-2: Consolidated Indigenous Mitigation List. As per the request of the JRP, new summary tables have been compiled to detail the mitigation measures related to Indigenous VCs. The tables consist of both mitigat ions and commitments related to the Indigenous VCs (as listed in Table 6.5-1) as well as mitigations and commitments related to associated VCs that are interconnected with the Indigenous VCs. There are six tables, five for Current Use of Lands and Resourc es for Traditional Purposes (Tables 6.5-2 through 6.5 -6) and one table for Physical and Cultural Heritage ( Table 6.5-7). The contents of these tables include: the pathway of effect that a given mitigation measure is addressing; a description of the mitigation measures or commitment; reference to the doc ument where the commitment was made or where the mitigation measure was described; description of how the mitigation will be implemented and the anticipated effectiveness of the mitigation measures; an explanation of how the mitigation is meant to address the effect; and the conclusion regarding whether there are residual effects after the application of mitigation measures.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 25 As indicated in the EIA (Section D.2.5.2, CIAR#42), mitigation is often achieved through iterative Project design ( e.g., through site selection to avoid sensitive areas and application of best practices during construction). Additional mitigation measures, over and above mitigation integrated into Project design, were identified for eac h effect, as required. Types of mitigation measures that were considered include: environmental protection measures and protocols; site-specific measures ( e.g., timing of activities to avoid biologically sensitive periods, site-specific mitigation design measures); and contingency measures to address the possibility of accidental events that could affect the environment. Mitigation for Project effects on Indigenous VCs is a combination of mitigation for associated VCs, plus mitigation specific to the Indigenous VCs. Once Project development begins and the mitigation has been implemented, effectiveness monitoring will commence and observed trends will be compared to predicted trajectories. An evaluation of the monitoring results will determine if adaptations to mitigation need to be implemented. A seque nce of actions is triggered if monitoring data indicate that environmental performance does not meet targets. To ensure implementation, the mitigation described throughout the EIA, other submissions, and agreements, has been, and will continue to be, incorporated into mitigation and monitoring plans for the Project, many of which are in draft and have been provided to the JRP. Monitoring protocols will be established soon after Project development begins s o that trends and progress can be evaluated. Should indicators not meet targets or trends diverge from the desired trajectory, mitigation can be modified as necessary. Tables 6.5-2 through 6.5-7 include the mitigation related to effects on Indigenous VCs for the Project. The first section of each table outlines the pathways of effect to which a given mitigation measure is linked. Linked biophysical VCs and pathways of effects on Indigenous VCs were described in Tables 3.1.2-1 and 3.2.1-1 of An Updated As sessment of the Potential Effects of the Grassy Mo untain Project on Indigenous Groups (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 3.2.1, CIAR#251). Table 3.1.2-1 has been updated to better reflect linkages between associated biophysical VCs and the effects on I ndigenous VCs, and is presented below as Table 6.5-1. The layout of Tables 6.5 -2 through 6.5-7 follows the order of VCs and the potential effects listed in Table 6.5-1. By structuring the table in this manner, it is clear how the mitigation is related to the potential effects on Indigenous VCs.

The Project may intersect or be in proximity to sacred, gath ering, and habitation sites identified by some Indigenous groups. The consequences are: loss of opportunities for hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering and reduced engagement in these activities, which could affect the cultural and spiritual rel ationship between Indigenous groups and their territory.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 28 loss of intergenerational knowledge transfer opportunities due to redu ced locations and activities where and during these exchanges occur, which could affect the relationship between Indigenous groups and their cultural and spiritual values. change in use of, access to, or disturbance to features associated with sacred, gathering, or habitation sites, which may change the cultural value or importance to the value. Benga has committed to implementin g mitigation measures (Tables 6.5 -2 through 6.5-7) to reduce Project effects on these VCs. The implementation of the mitigation measures and commitments will be through: Project-specific policies, procedures and training; numerous management plans develop ed (or to be developed) for the Project; commitments contained within agreements with the Indigenous groups; and expected condi tions of regulatory approvals. Monitoring and adaptive management will be an important part of ensuring that mitigation measures are effective. Indigenous groups have provided Benga with recommendations on mitigation measures that could address potential effects on Indigenous Rights ( e.g., hunting or fishing); these were summarized in response to Addendum 10, ( 18.3 ( CIAR#251). After the implementation of mitigation measures, there will be a remaining residual effect on hunting, trapping, fishing, plant gathering, and trails and travelways for Indigenous groups who identified hunting, trapping, fishing, plant gathering, and trails and travelways interests in the Project area. There will be a residual effect on cultural and spiritual values and physical and cultural heritage. Description and characterization of residu al effects are provided for each Indigenous group in the response to JRP IR-6.7.

Support an Indigenous monitoring program(s) that will include monitoring of a suite of culturally defined environmental attri butes, and consideration of cultural heritage impacts and monitoring for cultural sites. Continue to work with the Indigenous community to identify ways in which TK can be considered during Project activities and i n the development of environmental management plans. Engage with t he Indigenous communitie s during construction, operations and reclamation, including review and input into management and monitoring plans, discussion of options to facilitate access for traditional activities, construction timing a nd reclamation.Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251 Implementation of mitigation measures for hunting will be through the commitments contained within agreements with the Indigenous group, as well as expected conditions of regulatory approvals. Mitigation effectiveness will be monitored through devel opment and implementation of Indigenous -led monitoring program with advice from the Indigenous Environmental Stewardship Committee. Mitigations listed here are in addition to biophysical VC mitigations and were proposed by Indigenous groups to address Project effects on cultural and spiritual values such as hunting and trapping. Benga will consider allowing access to Benga -owned lands outside the Project footprint within the RSA for traditional use such as hunting and trapping. Benga will wo rk with the Nations to identify key areas and develop an Access Management Plan for traditional use.Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.1.1.5, CIAR #251 Benga has committed to developing an Indigenous monitoring program in cooperation with nearby Indigenous communities to work in parallel with other western science -based monitoring plans. In addition, Benga will consult with Indigenous groups in developing the monitoring programs through a series of workshops. Benga has committed to providing Annual Reporting documents to Indigenous groups highlighting the results from the monitoring programs and seeking any input that would helpBenga improve monitoring and the effectiveness of mitigation measures.Wildlife Mitigation and Monitori ng #251) Benga has committed to consulting and involving nearby Indigenous groups in the ongoing development of C&R plans and C&R related monitoring as the Project advances through the construction, operations, and progressive reclamation phases.Updated C&R Plan (Addendum 10, Appendix 2.6-1, Section F.2.7, CIAR #251) Change in identified hunted or trapped species and habitat Wildlife: including moose, elk, grizzly bear, American marten and Canada lynx (Loss of habitat availability due to vegetation clearing and sensory disturbance due to increased noise, odour, visual disturbance) Mitigation measures that will be implemented to reduce adverse effects on wildlife habitat include: To support the reclamation plan mitigation measures, the following will be implemented to mitigate potential direct and indirect Project effects on wildlife habitat availability: Cleaning and equipment use/storage/cleaning in undisturbed areas within and adjacent t o the project footprint will be avoided. Vegetation adjacent to high- activity linear corridors (e.g., access roads, coal conveyor) will be retained to reduce the extent of noise and visual sensory disturbances to the extent possible. Incorpora te the exis ting legacy mining disturbances into the development and reclamation plans for the project, and other proposed land use activities to the best extent possible so that habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, linear disturbance features, and cumulative habitat loss are minimized. Preserve remnant forest patches within the development areas where feasible to provide habitat, habitat connectivity and hide cover for wildlife species. Protect important wildlife habitat features in areas of suitable wildli fe habitat. Where appropriate, vegetated buffer zones (100 m or minimum of 30 m; pending topography constraints) will be maintained between Project infrastructure and wetlands, creeks, and streams to the best extent possible. Retain slash and large woody debris in th e salvaged soil to provide microsites for native plant and hide cover for wildlife.Wildlife Mitigation and Monitoring Plan (WMMP) (Addendum 10, Appendix 5.39-1, Appendix 2.6-1, Section F.2.8, CIAR#251); and Implementation of the mitigation measures for hunting and trapping, as it relates to wildlife, will occur through the development and implementation of Project-specific policies, procedures, training, management plans and through the commitments contained within agreements with the Indigenous groups, as well as expected conditions of regulatory approvals. The wildlife mitigation will be implemented, monitored, and verified through its inclusion in the the Draft Wildlife Mitigation and Monitoring Plan (WMMP) and the updated C&R Plan. The WMMP contains both mitigation and mitigation monitoring components. T he mitigation is expected to reduce the adverse effects of the Project on hunted species and their habitat. Mitigations to reduce effects on wildlife habitat will, by extension, reduce effects on identified hunted or trapped species and habitat.

Undertake pre -disturbance surveys prior to construction activiti es to deter mine the occurrence of any important wildlife habitat features. Maximize the direct placement of salvaged soil to enhance native plant development. Establish a variety of vegetation species and communities suitable for wildlife, and encourage structural complexity within the forests. Encourage understory complexity in reclaimed forests by planting native shrubs such as alder and willow. Ensure that core security areas are provided for wildlife. Provide water management program that ensures the surface water quality is maintained. Limit sight lines by maintaining mature forest stands as buffers between roads and reclamation areas.Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251] The monitoring program was developed to verify the effectiveness of mitigation designed to minimize changes in wildlife habitat availability, habit at connecti vity and movement and mortality risk. Monitoring will be conducted throughout the life of the Project to document wildlife responses to the Project and to Benga's mitigation program. Monitoring is required to assess and verify environmental performance (i.e., that the mitigation program is being completed as planned and is achieving its objectives) and to ensure continual improvement in environmental performance. The focus of the monitoring program will be on obtaining key information that can inform and guide the mitigation process. Benga will focus mitigation monitoring efforts on parameters that are directly related to mitigation effects that provide opportunities to improve mitigation performance over time. This wildlife monitoring approach will enab le Benga to evaluate the effectivene ss of their wildlife protection, mitigation, and reclamation procedures and to ensure that the Project does not adversely affect wildlife in the region. As with the mitigation program, the mitigation monitoring program is viewed as adaptive and is expecte d to change as understanding of the responses of wildlife to Project development increases (Addendum 10, Appendix 5.39-1, WMMP, CIAR#251). Wildlife: including moose, elk, grizzly bear, American marten and Canada lynx (Increased wildlife mortality risk due to construction activities, vehicle collisions, and human-wildlife conflicts) Mitigation measures that will be implemented to reduce wildlife mortality risk include: Conducting pre -disturbance surveys (wildlife sweeps) in the development area prior to any construction activities during the Project. All access to the Mine Permit will be controlled, no uncontrolled access will be permitted. Support active bear management plans. If a site specific plan is required, it will be developed in consultation with Indigenousgroups as part of the WMMP. The plan is expected to be a comprehensive document that outlines operational strategies and best practices for addressing concerns related to not only bear-human conflicts but potential risks to ungulates and other wildlife resulting from attraction of bears to the area. A detailed Waste Managem ent Plan will be d eveloped and implemented prior to construction and operational activities to minimize the attraction of wildlife. Benga will follow the Best Management Practices for camps, fences, and barriers as describedin Bear Smart: Best Management Practices for Camps, and ensure all waste is stored in wildlife -proof containers and disposed of properly. All on -site staff will receive Bear Awareness Training. Implementing an Emergency Spill Response Plan to limit the effect of accidental spills. Spills will be minim ized by restricting fuel storage and filling to designated areas that are at least 100 m from wetlands and watercourses as well as Project drainage ditches, sediment control ponds, and pit lakes. Storing all hazardous materials, including those used for bl asting, in secure areas that are inaccessible to wildlife (e.g, buildings, storage areas surrounded by wildlife -proof fencing). In addition, proper handling and storage of industrial materials and debris within the Project footprint will be maintained to minimize potential risks to wildlife. Developing procedures to clear blasting areas of large mammals or birds prior to blasting. Designing water management ponds and drainage ditches, and pit lakes to minimize potential entrapment of wild life. Enforcing speed limits (50 km/hr) along the main access road and utility corridors, and placing signs at identified wildlife crossings to increase driver diligence. Vehicles will yield to all wildlife crossing the main access road.WMMP (Addendum 10, Appendix Mitigations to reduce effects on wildlife mortality risk will, by extensio n, reduce effects on identified hunted or trapped species and habitat. Wildlife: including moose, elk, grizzly bear, American marten and Canada lynx (Reduced wildlife movement due to creation of barriers) Mitigation measures that will be implemented to reduce adverse effects on wildlife movement include: A minimum of six wildlife crossings (underpasses and overpasses) will be incorporated into the design of the coal conveyor: Strategically placed in locations that will maximize wildlife us e; Additional pre-disturbance surveys will be conducted to identify important wildlife habitats and trails along the access road and conveyor corridor; Natural underpasses using topography are preferred; and Above-ground crossings may be required when topography is not favourable, conveyor will likely be raised higher above theground to allow wildlife movement under it. Road plowing and grading will be conducted in a manner that does not restrict wildlife from crossing access roads or accessing wildlife cros sings.WMMP (Addendum 10, (Addendum 10, Appendix 2.6-1, Mitigations to reduce effects on wildlife movement will, by extension, reduce effects on identified hunted or trapped species and habitat.

Trees and bushes will be preserved around mines and plant, because they effectively trap dust emissions fr om mining activities and reduce dust concentrations farther from mining activities.Air Quality Monitoring Plan (Addendum 10, Appendix 1.3-1, Section 5, CIAR #251) Mitigations to reduce effects on wildlife health will, by extension, reduce effects on ident ified hunted or trapped species and habitat. Store all hazardous materials, including those used for blasting, in secure areas that are inaccessible to wildlife (e.g., buildings, storage areas surrounded by wildlife -proof fencing). In addition, proper handling and storage of industrial materials and debris within the Project footprint will be maintained to minimize potential risks to wildlife.EIA, CR#9, Section 7.1.5, CIAR#42 Provide water management program that ensures the surface water quality is maintained.

The AMP will control access to authorized persons, will ban fishing by employees, and facilitate access to traditional use areas for Indigenous groups, where feasible. The AMP will include notification of access restrictions during construction required for safety purposes to allow for planning alternateplant gathering locations and access routes. Benga will allow Indigenous groups to access Benga private land, outside of the Project following the AMP for the purposes ofharvesting lodgepole pine and other culturally important plants. Engage with the Indigenous groups during construction, operations and reclamation, including review and input into management and monitoring plans , discussion of options to facilitate access for traditional activities, construction timing, and reclamation. Where identified by Indigenous groups, sites of cultural and sacred importance within 100 m of Project activity and outside the Project footprint will be marked or otherwise protected prior to land disturbance. If avoidance of any these sites is not possible, Benga will work with Alberta Culture and Tourism and/or Indigenous groups to develop and plan for mitigation of the site. Continuing to cons ult with local stakeholders and Indigenous groups through the life of the Project to identify concerns and proactively address issues when they arise. Develop and implement a Cultural Site Discovery Contingency Plan in consultation with Indigenous communities for culturally important sites identifie d during construction and operations. Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251 Implementation of mitigation measures for access will be through the development and implementation of policies, proc edures, training, and management plans. The mitigation to reduce Project effects on access will be implemented through its inclusion in the Access Management Plan (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.5-1, CIAR#251), the goals of which are to: Maintain an open and transparent dialogue for traditional and recreational use requests through the duration of the Project; Minimize the impact of changes to access within,and adjacent to, the Project footprint; Maintain an effective access management strategy that balances Indigenous Rights, workplace safety, and environmental protecti on; Monitor the effectiveness of defined access protocol (including permitting); and Utilize an adaptive management approach to maximizing access opportunities where feasible. Mitigation will also be implemented through the commitments contained within agreements with the Indigenous groups, as well as expected conditions of regulatory approvals. Mitigations to add ress effects on access will, by extension, reduce effects on access to hunting and trapping locations. Mitigation measures that will be implemented in the Access Management Plan include : Provide training to all staff and contractors regarding respectful land use and access management: promote cultural diversity awareness to Benga's employees and contractors. Access points and roads to be clearly labelled and documented. Recreational land use restrictions for employees and contractors will be emphasized to minimize intensive hunting, fishing, and other recreational pressures around the Project boundary.Access Managemen t Plan (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.5-1, CIAR#251) BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 32 Table 6.5-2 Mitigation Measures and Commitments for Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes for Hunting a nd Trapping Effects Pathways Mitigation Measures Potential Effect on Indigenous VC Related VCs and Effects Pathway on Related VCs that Affect the Indigenous VC Mitigation / Commitments Reference for Mitigation or Commitment Implementation and Effectiveness of Mitigation How the Mitigation Addresses Effects on Indigenous VC Notification of access restrictions during construction as required for safety purposes to allow for planning alternate trails and travelways.

Signage to be used for identifying areas that are not open for public use. Share information about construction timing. Share the environmental performance of the Project with Indigenous groups on a regular basis through the life of the Project. Access and use of OHVs on Benga -owned lands and the Project footprint will be controlled through the AMP. The only linear footprint of the project is along the main access road which will also incorporate the covered conveyor and the power line for supplying electricity to the mine. Return Crown leases to the Crown after reclamation is completed.[also Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 4.3.2.5] To determine if the AMP is effective in accommodating traditional and recreational access requests, Benga will seek feedback from internal stakeholders, acces s users, Indigenous groups, and the Safety, Health & Environment department and identity indicator s that can be monitored over time. The findings of the AMP monitoring program will drive adaptive changes to the way Benga manages access requests, communica ting access permitting requirements, and soliciting feedback from access users. Noise (Increased noise during construction and operation could affect use of hunti ng or trapping locations by Indigenous groups and preferred harvesting method) Mitigation measures that will be implemented to reduce adverse effects of noise include: Routing the haul trucks (conveying waste rock and coal) along the western slope of the south disposal area such that the south disposal area itself provides noise shielding between the operating equipment and the residential receptors to the east. Monitor concerns that are raised by local residents and implement, if necessary, specific measur es (e.g., flashing light instead of backup alarm at night, directional backup alarms). Use of mufflers on all internal combustion engines. Installing and maintaining a 15 m tall earthen berm along the eastern edge of the south disposal area. Blasting to oc cur only on weekdays during typical day-time hours. Minimizing blasting during cloud cover. Limiting blasting to smaller more localized blasts, which reduces the amount of explosives used at any one time.EIA, Section E.2.5.1, CIAR#42 Implementation of mit igation measures for hunting and trapping, as it relates to noise, will be through the development and implementation of policies, procedures, training, and management plans and through the commitments contained within agreements with the Indigenous groups , as well as expected conditions of regulatory approvals. Mitigations to address effects of noise by extension, reduce effects on use and enjoyment of hunting or trapping locations. Should a low frequency noise complaint be received, Benga will conduct a comprehensive sound level (CSL) survey in accordance with the requirements of the AER Directive 038.EIA, Section A.11.2.2, CIAR #42 Air Quality (Increased dust or odour during construction and operation could affect use of hunting or trapping locations by Indigenous groups and preferred harvesting method) Mitigation measures that will be implemented to reduce adverse effects of dust include: Speeds on mine roads will be limited to 50 km/hr. Speed reduction does not eliminate total emissions but does reduce acute concentrations/exposure. Systemic application of water to haul roads and to the plant access road to minimize dust. Gravel or crushed rock will be used as the underlay on the haul roads. Gravel is observed to produce less dust than clay and s andy surfaces. Use of a grader to maintain the active surface of the access road. This procedure is expected to reduce the effective slit content of the portion of the road where the wheels of the haul trucks travel. Reclamation and revegetation progressively to reduce windblown fugitive dust emissions. Trees and bushes will be preserved around mines and plant to trap dust emissions from mining activities. The coal processing plant module will be contained within an enclosed area and all coal material hand ling will be via covered conveyors. Dust generation from transferring the coal from conveyor to the stockpile will be minimized by the use of luffing stackers whichwill minimize the drop height of the coal. Fugitive dust generation will be minimized at th e rail load -out, with full cladding on the sides of the load-out structure to create a wind shelter, and with the movable discharge chute of the bin located as close as practical to the coal within the rail cars.Air Quality Monitoring P lan, (Addendum 10, Appendix 1.3-1, Section 5, CIAR#251) [also EIA, CR#1, Section 6.6, CIAR#42] Implementation of the mitigation measures for hunting and trapping, as it relates to air quality, will occur through the development and implementation of Proje ct specific policies, procedures, training and management plans and through the commitments contained within agreements with the Indigenous groups, as well as expected conditions of regulatory approvals. Mitigation will be implemented, monitored and verified through their i nclusion in the Draft Air Quality Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan. The mitigation is expected to reduce or minimize the adverse effects of the Project on air quality and will be monitored through the implementation of the air monitoring plans to verify the effectiveness of mitigation measures over time to ensure that the Project related effects on air quality are avoided or minimized. Mitigations to address effects of dust and odour will, by extension, reduce effects on use and enjoyment of hunting or trapping locations.

Benga will investigate alternative ANFO formulations that reduce NOx emissions during blasting. Emis sions will be managed through operations means by developing a program to minimize idling, optimizing the mine place to minimize haul distances, and maintaining the fleet to manufacturer's specifications.EIA, Section CIAR #251) The purpose of the Air Quality Monitoring Plan is to outline a process to mitigate potential Project effects on air quality, assess mitigation effectiveness through monitoring and adapt mitigation as necessary and possible based on monitoring results. Benga has already committed to these mitigation measures and expects that they would become part of the anticipated EPEA approval for the Project. A monitoring program has been developed (Section 6) to measure the effectiveness of mitigation in monitoring air emissions and air quality related to the Project. Benga will engage with Indigenous groups in the future to confirm that the air quality mitigation and monitoring plan accommodates input provided by Indigenous groups. Lighting (Increased visual disturbances during construction and operation could affect use of hunting or trapping locations by Indigenous groups and preferred harvesting method) Mitigation measures that will be i mplemented to reduce adverse effects of Project lighting include: Use of low visibility spectrum lights on CHPP and rail loadout structures. Use of low visibility spectrum lights in light stands, designed with directional shades to minimize illumination ab ove the lights horizontal line and to direct light to the illuminated feature. Implementation of an on -demand and adaptive light management strategy (i.e., activated when needed) at the rail loadout during times a train set is not onsite for loading during nighttime hours. Where possible, minimize the amount of train loading during nighttime hours. Light-duty vehic les along the access road will be kept to a minimum. The overland conveyor system will not be equipped with any additional lighting structures, as lighting would be provided by theassociated access road lights. Existing vegetation (mature trees) will not be cleared along areas requiring night -time illumination to reduce total viewshed. Mobile lighting on the waste rock disposal area(s) would only be used when needed and will be equipped with low visibilityspectrum lights. Mobile lighting would be positioned (where possible) at the base of existing high points (such as the noise mitigation berm) to reduce their associated viewshed.EIA, CR#1, Secti on 5.16.2, CIAR#42 Mitigations to address effects of lighting will, by extension, reduce effects on use and enjoyment of hunting and trapping locations. Implement visual impact mitigation that reduces stray and non- essential artificial lighting to minimize wildlife effects and that will comply with OH&S safety requirements.EIA, Section A.11.9, CIAR #42 Cultural and Spiritual Values (Loss of hunting or trapping opportunities or change in hunting methods could affect the cultural and spiritual relatio nship between the Nation and their territory) See mitigations and commitments outlined in Table 6.5-6 for Cultural and Spiritual Values.

Support an Indigenous monitoring program(s) that will include monitoring of a suite of culturally defined environmental attributes, and consideration of cultural heritage impacts and monitoring for cultural si tes. Continue to work with the Indigenous community to identify ways in which TK can be considered during Project activities and in the development of environmental management plans. Engage with the Indigenous communities during construction, operations and reclamation, including review and input intomanagement and monitoring plans, discussion of options to facilitate access for traditional activities, construction timing a nd reclamation.Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251 Implementati on of mitigation m easures for fishing will be through the commitments contained within agreements with the Indigenous groups, as well as expected conditions of regulatory approvals. Mitigation effectiveness will be monitored through development and implementation of Indigenous-led monitoring program with advice from the Indigenous Environmental Stewardship Committee. Mitigations listed here are in addition to biophysical VC mitigations and were proposed by Indigenous groups to address Project effects on cultural and spiritu al values such as fishing. Benga will consider allowing access to Benga -owned lands outside the Project footprint within the RSA for traditional use such as fishing.Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.1.2.4, CIAR#251 Change in identified fish ing species and habitat Fish and Aquatic Resources (Westslope Cutthroat Trout), Surface Water Quality, Hydrology (Loss of habitat availability and quality, and change in flow regime; Decrease in fish health due to potential exposure to contaminants from sediment discharge) Mitigation measures that will be implemented to reduce adverse effects on fish and aquatic habitat include: A Detailed Fisheries Offsetting and Draft Offsetting Effectiveness Monitoring Plan have been proposed (Addendum 8, Appendices B1 a nd B2, CIAR#89) that more than offset the habitat losses caused by the Project related to Gold Creek and Blairmore Creek, and involve the enhancement/creation of aquatic and riparian habitat. Maintain a 100 m undisturbed forested buffer around Blairmore and Gold Creeks.Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251 Implementation of the mitigation measures for fishing, as it relates to f ish and fish habitat, will occur through the development and implementation of Project -specific policies, procedures, training, management plans, through the commitments contained within agreements with the Indigenous groups, as well as expected conditions of regulatory approvals. The aquatics and fish habitat mitigation will be implemented, monitored and verified through their inclusion in the Aquatic Monitoring Plan (Addendum 11, Appendix 6.23-1); Detailed Fisheries Offsetting Plan, (Addendum 8, Appendix B-1, CIAR #89); and the Offsetting Effectiveness Monitoring Plan (Addendum 8, Appendix B-2, CIAR #89). The mitigation is expected to reduce or minimize the adverse effects of the Project on fish and fish habitat and will be monitored through the implementation of the various aquatic monitoring plans to verify the effectiveness of mitigation measures over time to ensure that the Project related effects on the aquatic environment are avoided or minimized . Implementation and effectiveness of offsett ing are managed by several sections in the Detailed Fisheries Offsetting Plan: Section 7.1.4 of the Offsetting Plan outlines contingency mea sure if the offsetting measures are deemed ineffective, potential additional offsetting measures have been identifie d. Section 8.0 details the implementation of the offsetting measures. Uncertainty regarding the offsetting mitigation is discussed in Sect ion 9.1: Acknowledging Uncertainty, Time Lag, Underlying Habitat, and Complementary Measures. Increasing Mitigations to address effects on Fish and Aquatic Resources, Surface Water Quality, and Hydrology will, by extension, reduce effects on changes in identified fishing species and habitat. Changes in water tempera ture will be mitigated by: Minimize the removal of riparian vegetation. Maintain appropriate riparian reserves and management zones from watercourses, where feasible. Construction of online settling ponds for clean (non-contact) water and mine -influenced (contact) water in lowest reach of affected tributary streams. Although changes in stream temperatures are not predicted to occur, implement monitoring of discharges and ambient variables in receiving environments to ensure that water quality is within tole rances for WSCT. i.e., Develop a progressive reclamation plan to accelerate revegetation, reforestatio n and end land uses to provide overhanging cover and shade for watercourses. Changes in WSCT food supply will be mitigated by: Minimize the removal of riparian vegetation. Maintain appropriate riparian reserves and management zones from watercourses, where feasible. Construction of online settling ponds for clean (non-contact) water and mine -influenced (contact) water in lowest reach of affected tributary s treams. Monitor discharges and ambient variables in receiving environments to ensure that water quality is within tolerances for WSCT. Develop a progressive reclamation plan to accelerate revegetation, reforestation and end land uses to provide overhangingcover and shade for watercourses.Draft Aquatic Monitoring Plan (Addendum 6.23-1, Table CIAR#44] BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 35 Table 6.5-3 Mitigation Measures and Commitments for Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes for Fishing Effects Pathways Mitigation Measures Potential Effect on Indigenous VC Related VCs and Effects Pathway on Related VCs that Affect the Indigenous VC Mitigation / Commitments Reference for Mitigation or Commitment Implementation and Ef fectiveness of Mitigation How the Mitigation Addresses Effects on Indigenous VC Changes to sediment supply, transport mechanisms and sediment yield will be mitigated by: Develop erosion and sediment control based on industry standards. Design access and mine haul roads to a stable angle to reduce e rosion. Store salvaged topsoil away from watercourses and surface waterbodies. Apply erosion and sediment control practices to salvaged soil to reduce potential erosion and sediment transport off-site. Direct surface water runoff and pit water to the appropriate water management infrastructure (e.g., sedimentation ponds). Discharge water to watercourses in a manner that does not cause erosion or other damage to downstream areas. Develop a progressive reclamation plan to accelerate revegetation, reforestation and end land uses to provide overhanging cover and shade for watercourses. Changes to surface water quality will be mitigated by: Clean -water ( i.e., runoff collected from natural non-disturbed areas; non mine -influenced water) will be directed towards sedimentation ponds. Water quality will be managed to comply with water quality criteria that are protective of aquatic health. Techniques identified in the mine plan and water management plan to mitigate mine -influenced water aimed to avoid the potential for water quality effects that can affect fish and fish habitat. Changes to calcite precipitation will be mitigated by: Minimize the waste rock spoil areas within local watersheds to limit the area of waste rock that may come into contact with surface water systems. Develop a calcite monitoring and management to monitor the potential formation of calcite in Gold and Blairmore creeks andto control precipitation of calcite to within acceptable level. Changes to aquatic and/or riparian habitat for WSCT will be mitigated by: Minimize the Project's physical footprint. Existing infrastructure, rather than new infrastructure, will be used or upgraded where feasible and sustainable. Develop offsetting measures to counterbalance any permanent loss of riparian or fish habitat that cannot be avoided.confidence is discussed in Section 9.2: Building Confidence in the Selected Offsetting Measures. Benga will implement a management, monitoring and reporting program to: 1. Monitor environmental protection during construction ofoffsetting activities; and 2. Confirm that habitat offsetting measures meet their intended design objectives through an initial as built design compliance monitoring, and follo wup habitat performance effectiveness monitoring. The Draft Offsetting Effectiveness Monitoring Plan (Addendum 8, Appendix B-2, CIAR #89) focuses on effectiveness monitoring, that is comprised of a rigorous, science-based design. The goal of the Monitoring Plans design is to evaluate and verify the performance of the selected offsetting. The plan is designed to evalua te the efficacy of offsetting measures through the achievement of defined success criteria, and to evaluate the establishment of structure a nd function of the various ecological features of the offset habitats. The approach uses scientifically defensible sampling methodologies that will allow for the verification of identified habitat gains, thus fish productivity to confirm appropriate compensation has been provided to offset Project -related losses. A Draft Aquatics Monitoring Plan has been filed (Addendum 11, Appendix 6.23-1), which contains the mitigation listed here and is expected to be a condition of the EPEA approval. The Plan involve d the monitoring of various aquatic components: water quality, aquatic effects, calcite, groundwater fluvial geomorphology, bioenergetics, , and WSCT population, all aimed at monitoring the effectiveness of the mitigation related to fish and fish habitat. Effects on flows will be mitigated through: Coal handling and processing plant facilities will be aligned in such a way to minimize drainage diversions and runoff interception ( e.g., maintain natural vegetated buffers between active mine areas and undisturbed streams). Design settling ponds according to the latest sizing methodology (1:10 year storm event and safely convey up to the 1:100 year flood event). Design a nd construct any potential watercourse crossings to meet or exceed the regulatory requirements for approval under the provincial Water Act. Construct clear span crossings over all watercourses identified as potential fish bearing streams use appropriately sized culverts, as required, to maintain drainage along non-fish bearing headwater tributaries and/or ephemeral drainage draws.

Mitigation will also be implemented through the commitments contained within agreements with the Indig enous groups, as well as expected conditi ons of regulatory approvals. Within the C&R plan, there are several other mitigation plans, each of which will have associated monitoring to evaluate the mitigation effectiveness: Rare plant propagule or relocation mitigation plan (Section F.3.2.1); Rare plant species general mitigation plan (F.3.2 .2); Whitebark pine and limber pine mitigation plan (F.3.2.3); Foothills rough fescue mitigation plan (F.3.2.4). An important component of the reclamation program will be the monitoring of the biophysical aspects of the program. The identification of successes and limitations early in the reclamation process will allow modifications to be made through the adaptive management program to be used at the Project. In addition to providing important feedback on the effectiveness of reclamation techniques, it will also provide data to use in planning the certification of reclaimed lands and the release of lands back to the Crown. The details of this program are outlined in Section F.3.9.3 of the Updated C&R Plan. Benga has committed to developing an Indigenous monitoring program in cooperation with nearby Indigenous groups to work in parallel with other western science-based monitoring plans. In addition, Benga will consult with Indigenous groups in developing the moni toring programs through a series of workshops. Benga has committed to providing Annual Reporting documents to Indigenous groups highlighting the results from the monitoring programs and seeking any input that would help Benga improve monitoring and the effectiveness of mitigation measures. Implementation of the Fescue Grassland Community Mitigation Plan to reduce adverse effects on plant gathering include: Minimize overall project disturbance and avoid fescue where possible. Identify potential areas on hill crests and southern aspects suitable for re -establishment of native fescue grasslands. Direct reclamation material placement from grassland areas when opportunities exist. Collect native foothills rough fescue seed from across the site. Use wild harvested certified weed-free native seed as a monoculture and as part of a certified, weed -free native seed mix. Seed and grow foothills rough fescue plugs in a greenhouse for transplanting onto recl aimed areas of the site. Promote seeding of foothills rough fescue on the rough areas of the golf course to increase overall distribution of fescue grasslands.Updated C&R of the Whitebark Pine and Limber Pine Mitigation Plan to reduce adverse effects on plant gathering include: Minimizing the Project footprint to avoid populations of whitebark pine where possible. Adhering to the mitigation approaches outlined in the Alberta Whitebark Pine Recovery Plan. Introducing white pine blister rust resistant strains during reclamation phases. Conserving genetic diversity, by collecting cones from whitebark pine trees within the disturbance Footprint that are healthy andfree of disease after harvesting is completed. The cones will be provided to a greenhouse and seed will be extracted and stored until needed for the reclamation program. Planting according to the following strategies: Identifica tion of high light, low competition sites; Planting in pure stands or patches to avoid competition from other trees; Avoidance of potential swales and frost pockets; Creation of microsites for seedling establishment (rocks, stumps or other coarse woody debris); Use of recomme nded spacing to avoid interspecies competition; and Preferentially planting seedlings in the fall to avoid hot dry summer conditions.Updated C&R Plan (Addendum LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 41 Table 6.5-4 Mitigation Measures and Commitments for Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes for Plant Gathering Effects Pathways Mitigation Measures Potential Effect on Indigenous VC Related VCs and Effects Pathway on Related VCs that Affect the Indigenous VC Mitigation / Commitments Reference for Mitigation or Commitment Implementation and Effectiveness of Mitigation How the Mitigation Addresses Effects on Indigenous VC Mitigation measures that will be implemented to reduce adverse effects on forest resources include: Salvage of merchantable timber, both coniferous and deciduous.

Re-vegetati on of mineral soil wetlands with wetland riparian, emergent, and submergent vegetation species. During construction, salvage and store wetland soil and propagule materials from existing (baseline) wetlands within the Foot print for replacement during wetland reclamation and reconstruction activities. Opportunities to directly place wetland soil materials (soils and propagules) from adjacent wetlands, to provide a soil substrate with a propagule source for wetlands will occur. Where applicable, culverts will be placed within wetlands that may be divided by roads to ensure that water flow between wetlands will not be affected.Updated C&R Plan (Addendum CIAR#42] Change in use or access to identified plant gathering locations; Change in preferred plant gathering method Land and Resource Use Trails and Travelways (Loss or disruption of trails, loss of access to plant gathering locations, and loss of and preferred methods for plant gathering due to the mine site and access road) Mitigation measures that will be implemented to reduce adverse effects on access include: Benga will continue to work with affected Indigenous groups to improve the AMP to grant access to non-operational areas of Benga land and crown land being used for the project. The AMP will control access to authorized persons, will ban fishing by employees,and facilitate access to traditional use areas for Indigenous groups, where feasible. The AMP will include notification of ac cess restrictions during construction required for safety purposes to allow for planning alternate plant gathering locations and ac cess routes. Benga will allow Indigenous groups to access Benga private land, outside of the Project following the AMP for the purposes of harvesting lodgepole pine and other culturally important plants. Engage with the Indigenous groups during construction, operations and reclamation, including review and input into managementand monitoring plans, discussion of options to facilitate access for traditional acti vities, construction timing, and reclamation. Where identified by Indigenous groups, sites of cultural and sacred importance within 100 m of Project activity and outside the Project footprint will be marked or otherwise protected prior to land disturbance.

Return Crown leases to the Crown after reclamation is completed.Utilize an adaptive management approach to maximizing acce ss opportunities where feasible. Mitigation will also be implemented through the commitments contained within agreements with the Indigenous groups, as well as expected conditions of regulatory approvals. To determine if the AMP is effective in accommodat ing traditional and recreational access requests, Benga will seek feedback from internal stakeholders, access users, Indigenous groups, and the Safety, Health & Environment department and identity indicators that can be monitored over time. The findings of the AMP monitoring program will drive adaptive changes to the way Benga manages access requests, communicating access permitting requirements, and soliciting feedback from access users. Noise (Increase in noise during construction and operation could affect use and enjoyment of plant gathering locations or methods of plant gathering) Mitigation measures that will be implemented to reduce adverse effects of noise include: Routing the haul trucks (conveying waste rock and coal) along the western sl ope of the south disposal area such that the south disposal area itself provides noise shielding between the operating equipment and the residential receptors to the east. Monitor concerns that are raised by local residents and implement, if necessary, spe cific measures ( e.g., flashing light instead of backup alarm at night, directional backup alarms). Use of mufflers on all internal combustion engines. Installing and maintaining a 15 m tall earthen berm along the eastern e dge of the south disposal area. Blasting to occur only on weekdays during typical day-time hours. Minimizing blasting during cloud cover. Limiting blasting to smaller more localized blasts, which reduces the amount of explosives used at any one time.EIA, Section E.2.5.1, CIAR#42 Implementation of mitigation measures for plant gathering, as it relates to noise, will be through the development and implementation of Project -specific policies, procedures, training, and management plans and through the commitme nts contained within agree ments with the Indigenous groups, as well as expected conditions of regulatory approvals.

Speed reduction does not eliminate total emissions but does reduce acute concentrations/exposure. systemic application of water to haul roads and to the plant access road to minimize dust. Gravel or crushed rock will be used as the underlay on the haul roads. Gravel is observed to produce less dust than clay and sandysurfaces. Use of a grader to maintain the active surface of the access road. This procedure is expected to reduce the effective slit content ofthe portion of the road where the wheels of the haul trucks travel. Reclamation and revegetation progressively to reduce windblown fugitive dust emissions.

The mitigation is expected to reduce or minimize the adverse effects of the Project on air quality and w ill be monitored through the implementation of the air monitoring plans to verify the effectiveness of mitigation measures over time to ensure that the Project-related effects on air quality are avoided or minimized. The purpose of the Air Quality Monitoring Plan is to outline a process to mitigate potential Project effects on air quality, assess mitigation effectiveness through monitoring and adapt mitigation as necessary and possible based on monitoring results. Benga has already committe d to these mit igation measures and expects that they would become part of the anticipated EPEA approval for the Project. A monitoring program has been developed to measure the effectiveness of mitigation in monitoring air emissions and air quality related to the Projec t. Benga will engage with Indigenous groups in the future to confirm that the air quality mitigation and monitoring plan accommodates input provided by Indigenous groups. Mitigation measures for NOx emissions that will be implemented to reduce adverse effects of odour include: Use of Tier 4 engines in heavy dut y mine equipment. Benga will investigate alternative ANFO formulations that reduce NOx emissions during blasting. Emissions will be managed through operations means by developing a program to minimize idling, optimizing the mine place to minimize haul distances, and maintaining the fleet to manufacturer's specifications.EIA, Section 1.8-1, CIAR#251) Lighting (Increased visual disturbances during construction and operation could affect use and enjoyment of plant gathering locations or methods of plant gathering) Mitigation measures that will be implemented to reduce adverse effects of Project lighting include: Use of low visibility spectrum lights on CHPP and rail loadout structures. Use of low visibility spectrum lights in light stands, designed with directional shades to minimize illumination above the lights horizontal line and to direct light to the illuminated feature. Implementation of an on -demand and adaptive light management strategy (i.e., activated when needed) at the rail loadout during times a train set is not onsite for loading during night time hours. Where possible, minimize the amount of train loading during night time hours. Light-duty vehicles along the access road will be kept to a minimum. The overland conveyor system will not be equipped with any additional lighting structures, as lighting would be provided by t he associated access road light s. Existing vegetation (mature trees) will not be cleared along areas requiring night -time illumination to reduce total viewshed.

The mitigation is expected to reduce or minimize the adverse effects of the Project on air qu ality and will be monitored through the implementation of the air monitoring plans to verify the effectiveness of mitigation measures over time to ensure that the Project related effects on air quality are avoided or minimized. The purpose of the Air Quality Monitoring Plan is to outline a process to mitigate potential Project effects on air quality, assess mitigation effectiveness through monitoring and adapt mitigation as necessary and possible based on monitoring results. Benga has already committe d to these mitigation measures and expects that they would become part of the anticipated EPEA approval for the Project. A monitoring program has been developed to measure the effectiveness of mitigation in monitoring air emissions and air quality related to the Project. Mitigations to address effects on air quality will, by extension, reduc e effects of changes in use or access to identified trails and travelways. Mitigation measures for NOx emissions that will be implemented to reduce adverse effects of odour include: Use of Tier 4 engines in heavy duty mine equipment. Benga will investigate alternative ANFO formulations that reduce NOx emissions during blasting. Emissions will be managed through operations means by developing a program to minimize idling, optimizing the mine place to minimize haul distances, and maintaining the fleet to manufacturer's specifications.EIA, Section MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 46 Table 6.5-5 Mitigation Measures and Commitments for Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes f or Trails and Travelways Effects Pathways Mitigation Measures Potential Effect on Indigenous VC Related VCs and Effects Pathway on Related VCs that Affect the Indigenous VC Mitigation / Commitments Reference for Mitigation or Commitment Implementation and Effectiveness of Mitigation How the Mitigation Addresses Effects on Indigenous VC Lighting (Disturbance in enjoyment of use of trails and travelways due to lighting during construction and operation) Mitigation measures that will be implemented to reduce adverse effects of Project lighting include: Use of low visibility spectrum lights on CHPP and rail loadout structures. Use of low visibility spectrum lights in light stands, designed with directional shades to minimize illumination above the lights horizontal line and to direct light to the illuminated feature. Implementation of an on -demand and adaptive light management strategy (i.e., activated when needed) at the rail loadout during times a train set is not onsite fo r loading during night time hours. Where possible, minimize the amount of train loading during night time hours. Light-duty vehicles along the access road will be kept to a minimum. The overland conveyor system will not be equipped with any additional lighting structures, as lighting would be provided by the associated access road lights. Existing vegetation (mature trees) will not be cleared along areas requiring night -time illumination to reduce total viewshed. Mobile lighting on the waste rock disposal area(s) would only be used when needed and will be equipped with low visibilityspectrum lights. Mobile lighting would be positioned (where possible) at the base of existing high points (such as the noise mitigation berm) to reduce their associated viewshed .EIA, CR#1, Section 5.16.2, CIAR#42 Benga will engage with Indigenous groups in the future to confirm that the air quality mitigation and monitoring plan accommodates input provided by Indigenous groups.

Where identified by Indigenous groups, sites of cultural and sacred importance within 100 m of Project activity and outside the Project footprint will be flagged prior to land disturbance. Work with Alberta Culture and Tourism and the Indigenous community to develop and plan for mitigation of identified TK/TUfeatures if avoidance is not possible. Make minor modifications to the Project footprint to avoid and protect pre-contact sites DjPo -98 and DjPo-130.Addendum 10, Appendix 4.2-1, CIAR#251 Implement ation of mitigation measures for historical resources will be through the commitments contained within agreements with the Indigenous groups, as well as expected conditions of regulatory approvals, in particular those under the Historical Resources Act . Mitigation effectiveness will be monitored through development and implementation of Indigenous -led monitoring program with advice from the Indigenous Environmental Stewardship Committee. Mitigation to address effects on historical resources will, by extens ion, reduce effects on changes to cultural value or importance associated with physical and cultural heritage. To mitigate potential rail yard impacts, pertinent best management practices, as outlined in the Guidelines for the NewDevelopment in Proximi ty to Railway Operations, will be adhered to. Disturbance of any further remains located within the proposed rail load out footprint, will be mitigated with controlledexcavations to remove the remains. A mitigation excavation of approximately 80 m 2 will o ccur in the CHPP footprint in advance of Project development to remove all remaining historical resources or representative samples.

BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 55 Information Request 6.6 Information Request Package #4 from the Joint Review Panel to Benga, Information Requests 4.2 and 4.4. (CIAR #212). Tenth Addendum to the Environmental I mpact Assessment. Response to Information Request 4.2 and 4.4. (CIAR #251). Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency \"Technical Guidance for Assessing Physical and Cultural Heritage or any Structure, Site or Thing that is of Historical, Archeological, Pal eontological or Architectural Significance under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act , 2012 \". (March 2015). As the Panel noted in IR 4.2 (CIAR #212), physical and cultural heritage is not only associated with an individual physical site, but also with the experience lived by Indigenous peoples in those areas, and the importance of the landscape as a whole. In Appendix 4.1-1 (CIAR #251), in response to IR 4.4, Benga provides information on the potential effects to cultural heritage sites for specific In digenous groups. For example, with respect to Tsuut'ina Nation, Benga states that \"the potential effects... could result in a change in use or access or disturbance to features associated with sacred, gathering, or habitation s ites. Together, these changes w ill change the cultural value or importance to the value.\" In another instance, Benga states \"The Project will intersect or be in proximity to sacred, gathering and habitation sites identified by the Ktunaxa Nation.\" Benga notes that \"spiritual integrity o f the landscape will be forever changed despite lasting reclamation efforts\" however, no further description of the initial state of the spiritual integrity of the landscape, or the residual effects that will result in a permanent alteration of the spiritu al landscape, is provided. The \"Technical Guidance for Assessing Physical and Cultural Heritage or any Structure, Site or Thing that is of Historical, Archeological, Paleontological or Architectural Significance under the C anadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012\" 1 states that the heritage value of a resource is embodied in tangible and/or intangible character -defining elements. These elements include the materials, forms, location, spatial configurations, uses and cultu ral associations or meanings that embody the heritage value of a cultural resource, which must be retained to preserve that value. Tsuut'ina Nation stated (CIAR #286) that Benga has failed to properly scope and understand the impacts of the Project on transmission of knowledge, language and culture through lack of access to sites. Benga acknowledges in Appendix 4.1- 1 that \"Intergenerational knowledge provides instruction on cultural and spiritual practices such as gathering plants for food and subsistence, ceremonial procedures, legends, using plants as medicine and harvesting berries\" and indicates that the effects pathways consider both tangible and intangible values. Appendix 4.1- 1 indicates that Tsuut'ina members are 1 Available on line: Technical Guidance for Assessing Physical and Cultural Heritage or any Structure, Site or Thing that is of Historical, Archeological, Paleontological or Architectural Significance under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 56 \"granted the privilege of harvesting specific species, many of which are only found in specific environments (e.g., alpine areas such as at Grassy Mountain). Such rights are designated within the context of celebrations and customs, such as annual bundle openings and Sun Dance ceremonies\" (CIAR #251). Transmission of know ledge is however not carried forward as an effects pathway for cultural heritage, as shown in Table 3.2.1-1. Tsuut'ina Nation has stated that Benga's cumulative effects assessment in relation to their physical and cultural heritage is deficient as it doe s not consider the impacts of the Project on intangible culture, such as the ability to transmit knowledge to future generations because of access rest rictions or avoidance of areas because of noise and dust (CIAR #286). Tsuut'ina Nation notes \"Once knowledge of a place is lost by one generation, it is very difficult if not impossible to regain this knowledge in the future because this information is passed along inter -generationally\" (CIAR #286). The EIS Guidelines, Section 6.3.4 (CEAR #11) require Benga to consider how changes to the environment caused by the Project will affect the cultural value or importance associated with physical and cultural heritage and the current uses of land and resources for traditional purposes (e.g., inter- generational teachi ng of language or traditional practices, communal gatherings) and indirect effects such as avoidance of the area due to increased disturbance (e.g., noise, presence of workers). a) Provide an assessment of the effects of the Project on the intangible aspec ts of cultural heritage, including but not limited to cultural and spiritual practices,ceremonies, and intergenerational transfer of language, knowledge, and culture. b) For each biophysical VC that is identified as having a link to an Indigenous VC: i.describe the link from the biophysical VC or physical or cultural heritage site toany cultural and spiritual practices, ceremonies, and related intergenerationaltransfer of knowledge (i.e. if specific plants are used for ceremonial purposes,describe the ceremony, and its importance in Indigenous culture); and ii.describe how the effects to the specific biophysical VC or physical or culturalheritage site may affect cultural and spiritual practices, ceremonies, andintergenerational transfer of knowledge. c) Where residual effects to cultural and spiritual practices, ceremonies, and/or intergenerational transfer of knowledge are identified, describe the residual effect. d)Update the cumulative effects assessment in relation to the current use of lands andresources for traditional purposes and the physical and cultural heritage of IndigenousBENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 57 peoples to consider the effects of the Project on cultural and spiritual practices, ceremonies, and intergenerational transfer of knowledge. Response: Throughout its a nalysis of effects on Indigenous communities, Benga has focused on the following Indigenous Valued Components (VCs): Hunting and Trapping; Fishing; Plant Gathering; Trails and Travelways; Physical and Cultural Heritage; and Cultural and Spiritual Values Benga recognizes that predicted effects on wildlife, vegetation, water and air quality, aquatic ecosystems, noise, and other biophysical valued components impact on each of these Indigenous VCs in tangible and intangible ways. The combined effects of biophysical and secondary indirect project effects work to change the cultural value or importance of these values for each VC; these effects can act synerg istically on cultural and spiritual values to create intangible project effects on cultural and spiritual identity and community and individual well-being. These effects are therefore likely to be cumulative or residual in nature. In preparing responses to related IRs in this package, Benga has endeavoured to describe the Project and cumulative impact as well as proposed mitigative measures in its responses. As such, to the extent possible, Benga has included tangible and intangible effects on Indigenous VCs in the responses to the following IRs: the responses to JRP IR-6.5 and 6.7 link biophysical effects to intangible cultural and spiritual effects; the response to JRP IR-6.5 provides a list of mitigative measures to address Project effects; the response to JRP IR-6.7 provides an updated characterization of residual Project effects; and the response to JRP IR-6.8 provides an updated characterization of cumulative effects, including intangible effects, that are cumulative in nature. In particular, Benga notes that the Project site has been previously impacted by mining activity from the 1960s and is not curre ntly in its natural condition which will be corrected during the reclamation phase of the Project. Further, Benga has worked extensively with the most impacted Indigenous communities and has managed to reach agreement with many on mitigation BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 58 measures, rel ated to both tangible and intangible effects, so that they have been willing to provide letters of non- objection to the Project. In preparing these responses (JRP IR -6.5 through 6.8), Benga is aware that intangible effects are by definition those effects that cannot be objectively measured or evaluated. In fact, intangible in the Cambridge Dictionary is defined as, \"impossible to touch, to desc ribe exactly, or to give an exact value\". Further, Benga understands that effects on culture or personal mental w ell- being can be subjective, different between groups or individuals, and difficult to comprehend or understand by an observing third party. In order to incorporate intangible effects of the Project into its responses, therefore, Benga has relied heavily o n the input received from the Indigenous communities during the course of consultation for the Project. Benga has further, provided a draft o f this response to the most impacted Indigenous groups for comment and validation prior to submission to the JRP. Any comments received have been incorporated into this version. In order to support the evaluations in responses to JRP IR-6.5, 6.7 and 6.8, which all deal with tangible and intangible effects, Benga has utilized the input summarized in the following sections. Kainai Nation The Kainai TKUA indicates that the Crowsnest Pass area is a \"very sensitive area\" and is central to Blackfoot culture, sp irituality and culture (O'Connor, 2018, p. 63). The K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation maintain a strong and historically rooted cultural and spiritual connection to the land and animals surrounding the proposed mine site. There are many well -known and documented sacred places and gathering areas throughout the K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation territory. These sacred sites are unifying symbols, provide ev idence for cultural continuity and establish and reinforce national and personal connections to the landscape. The K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation noted Crowsnest Mountain (approximately 10 km west of the Grassy Mountain LSA) as an important landscape marker and associated with Blackfoot myths and traditional culture and is still referenced in ceremonial purposes (K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation, 2015, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42). While country foods have always been important for food, subsistence and sustenance, the practice of hunting has important cultural and spiritual considerations. Intergenerational knowledge about ceremonies, traditions and customs as well as use of harvested animals as medicine, food, tools, clothing, shelter and more is shared while hunting. In additional to this educational context, hunting practices are typically linked to other intangible values with spiritual, artistic and aesthetic elements. Likew ise, fishing has always been important for food, subsistence and sustenance and the activity of fishing has import ant cultural and spiritual considerations. Intergenerational knowledge about ceremonies, legends as well as fish use as BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 59 medicine, food and more is shared while fishing. In addition to this educational context, the activity of fishing is typically linked to other intangible values with spiritual, artistic and aesthetic elements. For example, fishing typically provides for quiet enjoyment of the landscape or access to water for other uses. Intergenerational knowledge provides instruction on cultural and spiritual practices such as gathering plants for food and subsistence, ceremonial procedures, legends, using plants as medicine and harvesting berries. In addition to this educational context, plant gathering activities are typically linked to other intangible values with spiritual, artistic, aesthetic and artistic elements.

There is a kinship with the animals which continues to provide le ssons and teachings by which to live. For example, beavers provided lessons in etiquette, pain, industry and work, seasonal cycles and vegetation. Other animals were symbols of prestige or had strict restrictions when it comes to sharing (Piikani Nation, 2015a, Appendix 7c, E IA, CIAR#42). BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 60 The Piikani Nation say that stories are connected with Grassy Mountain, but also all the mountains. The Piikani Nation's creation story is linked to the mountains which is one reason why they had camps sites and sacred spaces in the flat places in the mountains. Warrior societies at one time protected these places (Piikani Nation, 2015a, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42). The land is understood as a storybook. The Piikani Nation have not forgotten their connection to the land and their animals. They are deeply aware of the connection and the relationship. Elders have placed great pressure on themselves to make sure that cultural and spiritual values are not lost even when they can no long access these sites or harvest the an imals (Piikani Nation, 2015a, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42). The Piikani Nation continue with their traditional practices today and share what they know with their youth. It was acknowledged in a series of workshops that sharing cultural and spiritual knowl edge is not without its challenges. Frequently, they cannot access areas in their traditional territory and must exercise their traditional practices elsewhere (Piikani Nation, 2015a, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42). Among the critical cultural and spiritual k nowledge that is passed along is information on the seasonal round, animal behaviour in each season and what it says about seasonal conditions and ecological functioning, plants especially medicinal plants, harvesting skills, knowledge of symbology and the meaning behind symbology, travel and navigation and ceremonies (Piikani Nation, 2015a, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42). Cultural, spiritual, and ceremonial teachings are inextricably bound. While country foods have always been important for subsistence and s ustenance, the practice of hunting has important cultural and spiritual considerations. Intergenerational knowledge about ceremonies, traditions an d customs as well as use of harvested animals as medicine, food, tools, clothing, shelter and more is shared while hunting.

Plant species are important to the Stoney Nakoda Nation's ceremony, healing pract ices and spirituality. While the Stoney Nakoda Nation Site Summary does not provide exact locations of sacred places within the Project area, it mentions that there are areas on the mountain that are recognized by the Stoney Nakoda N ation Members as medit ation sites.

The geography and landscape of the Crowsnest Pass and the surrounding area play important roles in the spirituality of the Tsuut'ina Nation. There are sites sacred to the Tsuut'ina Nation in the area, including ceremonial sites and natural material to make ceremonial paint ( e.g., ochre) and items (Tsuut'ina Nation, 2015, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42). There are many wel l-known and documented sacred places and gathering areas throughout the Tsuut'ina Nation territory. These sacred sites are unifying symbols, providing evidence for cultural continuity and establishing and reinforcing national and personal connections to the landscape. The Project area and its associated features are used for spiritual purposes, including ceremonies. For example, various alpine plants are crucial for the Tsuut'ina Nation ceremonial purposes on Grassy Mountain and for healing practices and cultural identity (Tsuut'ina Nation, 2015, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42). BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 63 While the Tsuut'ina Nation works to retain and pass on knowledge from generation to generation, the Tsuut'ina Nation's, \"connection to their homeland through stories, myths and the continued use of and reverence for, sacred elements in the landscape such as Crowsnest Mountain is paramount to their cultural identity and survival\" (Tsuut'ina Nation, 2015, p. 49, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42). The Tsuut'ina way of life operates at different levels of existence, through the physical and spiritual worlds (Tsuut'ina Nation, 2015, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42). The Tsuut'ina Nation members act as stewards to plants and wildlife, with specific responsibilities, rights and powers transferred through songs and oral history (Tsuut'ina Nation, 2015, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42). For example, such rights are designated within the context of celebrations and customs, such as annual bundle openings and Sun Dance ceremonies. Indeed, the Tsuut'ina 'feel clos er to the Creator' at elevations and vision quest sites such as those on Grassy Mountain (Tsuut'ina Nation, 2015, p. 49, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42). While country foods have always been important for subsistence and sustenance, the practice of hunting has important cu ltural and spiritual values. Intergenerational knowledge about ceremonies, traditions and customs as well as use of harvested animals as medicine, food, tools, clothing, shelter and more is shared while hunting. Many species of wildlife and birds are culturally and spiritually important to the Tsuut'ina Nation. In addition to this educational context, hunting practices are typically linked to other intangible values with spiritual, artistic and aesthetic elements (Tsuut'ina Nation, 2015, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42). Intergenerational knowledge provides instruction on cultural and spiritual practices such as gathering plants for food and subsistence, ceremonial procedures, legends, using plants as medicine and harvesting berries. In addition to this educational context, plant gathering activities are typically linked to other intangible values with spiritual, artistic, aesthetic and artistic elements.

Rather, they view their spirituality as expressed in sites that are part of a complex that is roughly crescent shaped from Gold Creek and Blairmore Creek valleys and benches and the saddle of land connecting those between Grassy Mountain and Grassy Mountain South (Siksika Nation Consultation Office, 2018, Addendum 9, CIAR#185). It is at nearby Crowsnest Mountain that the Siksika Nation received the Thunder Pipe from Thunder before he was forced by Crow to live at Chief Mountain. For millennia, the Thunder Pipe ceremony was held at Grassy Mountain when the first thunder was heard each year. The Siksika Nation have used the area for over 9,000 years. With the coming of non- Blackfoot settlers, the Siksika Nation lost access to many of their sacred sites. They equate Grassy Mountain as being analogous to Lourdes (Siksika Nation, 2018, Addendum 9, CIAR#185). The Siksika Nation considers yellow ochre sites to be sacred and indicated that such sites are present in the LSA. The Siksika Nation remains connected to the land. There are many well-known and documented sacred places and gathering areas throughout the Siksika Nation territory. These sacred sites are unifying symbols, provide evidence for cultural continuity and establish and reinforce national BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 65 and personal connections to the landscape. Elders have placed great pressure on themselves to make sure that cultural and spiritual values are not lost even when they can no longer access these sites or harvest the animals (Siksika Nation, 2015, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42).

As indicated in submissions, and communicated during site visits to the Project area, qukin akitais (Raven's House or Crowsnest Mountain) is of particular importance as it forms the headwaters for the Crowsnest watershed, supporting Ktunaxa confidence in water and wild foods, and also embodies oral histories and cultural associations as the home of the creation being, Raven. The place name is also associated with oral histories of Ktunaxa chiefs from the area and specific ceremonial practices reliant on the cultural landscape and view scape surrounding Raven's House. Details regarding Ktunaxa ceremonial practice are considered private and confidential to the Ktunaxa Nation. Another key site located west of the LSA is Kuwiaki (Crowsnest Lake), also in the headwaters of the Crowsnest Watershed , translated as \"Heart of the Water\" (Schaeffer fieldnotes, 1932, p. 33, 1966 in Firelight Group, 2019, p. 15, Addendum 9, CIAR#185). There is also Ktunaxa Nation oral history associated with Frank and nearby Turtle Mountain. Current use of lands and resources for the Ktunaxa Nation is grounded in the concept of a\u00b7kxa mis qapi qaps in meaning \"the root all things and the relationship between all things including land, water, animals, Indigenous peoples and the air that we breathe,\" (Firelight Group, 2019, p. 16, Addendum 9, CIAR#185). The Project will affect this living balance that is said to link to the Ktunaxa Nation language and culture, connecting all things with the creator and with one another (Firelight Group, 2019, Addendum 9, CIAR#185). One site- specific cultural site called ma uk (Dirty BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 67 Water/ Bellevue) was reported in the category of cultural activity within the LSA although it is unclear whether this in a cultural heritage site or an area of use (Firelight Group, 2019, Addendum 9, CIAR#185). The Project area and the Crowsnest Pass conta in a multitude of ecological values tied to cultural and spiritual use and stewardship of the landscape, including the following animal species of critical importance: bighorn sheep, moose, elk, grizzly bear, mountain goat and bison. Bison is a particularly critical consideration for Ktunaxa use and oral history in the area (Firelight Group, 2019, Addendum 9, CIAR#185). While wild foods have always been important for food, subsistence and sustenance, the practice of hunting also has important cu ltural and spiritual considerations. Intergenerational knowledge about ceremonies, traditions and customs as well as use of harvested animals as medicine, food, tools, clothing, shelter and more is shared while hunting. In addition to this educational context, hunting practices are typically linked to other intangible values with spiritual, artistic and aesthetic elements. Likewise, fishing has always been important for food, subsistence and sustenance, the activity of fishing has important cultural and spiritual c onsiderations. Intergenerational knowledge about ceremonies, legends as well as fish use as medicine, food and more is shared while fishing. In addition to this educational context, the activity of fishing is typically linked to other intangib le values w ith spiritual, artistic and aesthetic elements. For example, fishing typically provides for quiet enjoyment of the landscape or access to water for other uses. The practice of gathering plants has important cultural and spiritual considerations as well as for food, subsistence and sustenance. Intergenerational knowledge about ceremonies, legends as well as plant use as medicine, food and more is shared while harvesting berries and plants. In addition to this educational context, plant gathering activities are typically linked to other intangible values with spiritual, artistic, aesthetic and artistic elements. While travel throughout amak is Ktunaxa on traditional Travelways was once necessary for subsistence and sustenance, today the practice of engaging with these Travelways is in addition a part of cultural identity and ceremonial and spiritual practice. Beyond using trails for traditional activities such as hunting, fish ing, gathering plants, etc. , Travelways are paths to reconnect with ancestors, oral traditions and the quiet enjoyment of nature (Firelight Group, 2019, Addendum 9, CIAR#185).

These sacred sites are unifying symbols, provide evidence for cultural continuity and establish and reinforce national and personal connections to the BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 69 landscape. For the Samson Cree Nation, the bear holds high spiritual and ceremonial value, along with timber (Samson Cree Nation, 2014, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42). The Samson Cree Nation expresses this connectivity in describing their connection with the lands within their territory, highlighting how they continue to further their culture and spiritual practices on the lands and water in and around the Rocky Mountain Foothills Region by: Carrying on Samson's traditional way of life by m aintaining its preferred use sites in and around the Program area (Samson Cree Nation, 2014, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42); Carrying out a variety of practices, traditions and customs within Samson Territory inand around the Program Area (Samson Cree Nation, 2014, Appendix 7c, EIA,CIAR#42); Cultivating and harvesting traditional herb s and medicines (Samson Cree Nation, 2014, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42); and Timber is important to the Samson Cree Nation because it is critical to hold ceremony(Samson Cree Nati on, 2014, p. 10, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42). The Samson Cree Nation assert th at their practices, traditions and customs are integral to their distinctive culture and traditional way of life (Samson Cree Nation, 2014, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42). For examp le, annual ceremonies and other traditional practices are utilized on a season al basis (Samson Cree Nation, 2014, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42). The Samson Cree Nation note the region of the Project holds spiritual importance for its members (Samson Cree Nation, 2014, Appendix 7c, CIAR#42); however, Samson Cree Nation has not identifi ed current or historic use for sacred sites, gathering sites, or habitation sites in the Project area. The Samson Cree Nation's cultural well -being is impacted by access to lands and their ability to harvest traditional foods, which are also essential for ceremonies and feasts (Samson Cree Nation, 2014, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42). Further, social and cultural opportunities for learning and knowledge transmission rely on these tra ditional practices. Samson Cree Nation holds ideals about respect for and rec iprocity with wildlife and the land (Samson Cree Nation, 2014, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42). Traditional networks and plant harvesting, and cultivation sites hold cultural importa nce for the Nation (Samson Cree Nation, 2014, Appendix 7c, EIA, CIAR#42).

Sections 4 to 17 of Appendix 4.1-1 contain Benga's effects assessment with respect to the current use of lands and resources for traditional purposes and cultural and physical heritage of Indigenous peoples, individually for each group. The EIS Guidelines (CIAR #11) require that residual effects, even if very small or deemed insignificant, be described in sufficient detail to enable the Panel to review Benga's analysis. The EIS Guidelines al so require that Benga provide an analysis of the significance of the identified residual effects of the Project using predefined criteria (e.g. magnitude; geographic extent, etc.). Although Benga has provided some of this information in Appendix 4.1-1, Benga has not adequately described the residual effects. For example, in the assessment of potential effec ts to Siksika Nation's hunting activities, Benga stated that: \"The Project will affect the wildlife VCs hunted by the Siksika Nation (e.g., moose, elk, bear, eagles) through changes in habitat availability, habitat fragmentation/connectivity and mortality risk. With successful application of mitigation measures, the residual effects of the Project on habitat availability, habitat fragmentation/connectivity, mortality risk and abundance within the Wildlife LSA (WLSA) were deemed not significant\". In this example, Benga has not described how the residual effects on the wildlife VCs hunted by Siksika are connected to the Indigenous VCs nor has Benga described the residual effect to hunting (e.g. to resources, access, use, experience, culture, etc.) that will remain after mitigation measures have been implemented. At a minimum, the description of residual effects should focus on the nature of the effect and des cribe changes to resources, access, use, and experience as well as taking into consideration cultural and spiritual practices, ceremonies, and intergenerational transfer of knowledge. Benga characterized the residual effects to hunting as being of moderate magnitude; local geographic extent; long- term duration; continuous frequency; reversible; and sensitive in ecological and social context. It remains unclear however what specific residual effects to hunting Benga has characterized. Benga did not provide an explanation of how the significance criteria were applied to the residual effects nor did Benga provide a rationale for how the conclusion of \"not significant\" was made. Provide the following: a)A description of each residual effect of the Project on the current use of lands and resources for traditional purposes following the Agency's \"Technical Guidance forBENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 75 Assessing Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012\"2. b) A description of each residual effect of the Project on the physical and cultural heritage following the Agency's \"Technical Guidance for Assessing Physical and Cultural Heritage or any Structure, Site or Thing that is of Historical, Archeological, Paleontological or Archi tectural Significance under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012\"3. c)An updated characterization of the residual effects of the Project for the current use of lands and resources for traditional purpose and the physical and cultural heri tage o f Indigenous peoples using the descriptions of the residual effects above. Response: Benga described and characterized residual effects of the Project on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes following the Agency's \"Technical Guidance for Assessing Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 \" and residual effects of the Project on the Physical and Cultural Heritage following the Agency's \"Technical Guidance for Asses sing Physical and Cultural Heritage or any Structure, Site or Thing that is of Historical, Archeological, Paleontological or Architectural Significance under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012\" . Benga considered potential changes in resources, access, use, and experience of engaging in traditional activities in the assessment of e ffects on Indigenous VCs. To address parts a) and b) of the information request, a description of the residual effects on Indigenous VCs (those listed in Tables 6.5-2 through 6.5- 7 after mitigation) are provided in Tables 6.7- 2a through 6.7 -9a. This description incorporates residual effects on associated VCs and how they are connected to the Indigenous VCs. The tables contain both the residual effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes, and Physical and Cultural Heritage. To address part c) of the information request, the characterization of residual effects, including an explanation of how the significance criteria were applied, is provided in Tables 6.7-2 through 6.7-9.

Table 6.7-2a Description and characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physi cal and Cultural Heritage for the K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Hunting 1. Hunted species and habitat: The Project will have temporary effects on land access for traditional resource use and on the distribution and abundance of species hunted for traditional purposes. Species preferring recently disturbed and young habitats are expected to return first, followed by species preferring increasingly older habitat types with reclamation. Moose and Elk: Suitable moose and elk habitat will decline initially but is predicted to be more abundant than baseline levels by end of mine due, in part, to reclamation of legacy mine sites that overlap the Project footprint (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.6.2.1, CIAR #42). The changes in abundance of moose and elk year -round in the WLSA are expected to follow a similar pattern as individuals of both species will be displaced into adjacent habitats. Grizzly Bear: Highly suitable grizzly bear habitat in the WLSA will decrease initially during the construction and operation phases and then increase throughout the duration of progressive reclamation. Mortality risk also increases with Project development but then decreases with progressive reclamation. With reclamation, the Project footprint is expected to offer more suitable habitat (dietary resources) and lower mortality risk than under baseline conditions, which are anticipated to allo w for an increase in the size of the grizzly bear population that the local area can support. Wildlife Residual Effects (EIA, CR#9, Table 5.3-26, CIAR #42): Effects on habitat availability for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) due to vegetation clearing and sensory disturbance (due to increased noise, odour, visual disturbance) are low magnitude, positive Project contribution, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife movement for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) due to construction and operation are low magnitude, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife abundance for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) in hunting location is low magnitude, positive Project contribution for elk and grizzly bear, neutral Project contribution for moose, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife mortality risk for hunted species due to construction activities, vehicle collisions, and human -wildlife conflicts are low magnitude, frequency is occasional, and reversible in the long -term. With the Access Control Policy and firearm prohibition by Project personnel, poaching and non- Indigenous hunting of moose, elk, and grizzly bear will decline in the WLSA during the life of mine and may result in increased abundance of moose, elk, and grizzly bear in the areas accessible by Indigeno us groups (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.6.2.1, CIAR #42). A screening level wildlife risk assessment was conducted, the results of which indicate that there is no potential risk of adverse effects associated with Project emissions on the health of wildlife in the s tudy areas (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.9- 1, Section 8.0, Updated Human Health and Wildlife Screening Risk Assessment, CIAR#251) . The wildlife risk assessment was amended to include an evaluation of water -based exposure pathways (both groundwater and surface w ater) and the results presented for Blairmore Creek, Gold Creek and the Oldman Reservoir were not considered to be indicative of adverse effects (Addendum 11 , JRP IR -6.28). For the proposed end pit lake (EPL) (at closure), the results of the risk assessment are not considered indicative of a human health concern; however, management considerations of the EPL are warranted and actual measured concentrations at the time of EPL creation should be used to revisit predicted effects (Addendum 11, JRP IR -6.27). Th e assessment includes an Indigenous- specific conceptual model, which describes sourcepathway linkages between the Project and Indigenous use of all aquatic pathways including the end pit lake, Blairmore and Gold Creeks, the Crowsnest River and the Oldman Reservoir in the post closure landscape. 2. Use or access to hunting locations and harvesting methods: Where Project construction and operations activities overlap with hunting locations, access to active mining areas may be limited until they are reclaim ed and safe. Indigenous groups will continue to have access to hunting and trapping locations where safety is not compromised (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). The Project's access restrictions within the mine permit area may also affect Indigenous groups' ability to use their preferred harvesting methods and seasonal rounds by altering the times of year that Indigenous groups have access to areas of interest for hunting within the mine permit area (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as moderate magnitude. Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of locations and the experi ence of hunting within the vicinity of the Project (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89); residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magn itude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42): The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). Where Indigenous groups utilize firearms for hunting, the Project's firearms restriction policy would affect their ability to use that harvesting method within the mine footprint. Alternate hunting methods may be possible in parts of the mine footprint that have not yet been disturbed or which have been reclaimed under the AMP (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.3, CIAR #89). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified hunted species and habitat, change use or access to identified hunting locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on hunting for K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation due to reduction in hunting opportunities, engagement in hunting, and hunting success during construction and operat ion due to loss of access of hunting locations, sensory disturbance, and change in wildlife use within the mine permit area, which could affect the cultural and spiritual relationship between the Nation and their territory, which is addressed below. Residual effects on hunting are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to hunt for the K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation in the area but this does not change the ability to hunt in the RSA.Although K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation do not hunt as extensively in the area today as they did in the past, they have identified use of and access to hunting locations within the vicinity of the Project and the area continues to be the source of wildlife hunted for use in ceremonies, sacred bundles, and for subsidence purposes (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 4.3.1.1, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extendbeyond the mine footprint but will be limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency because loss of hunting opportunitieswill be continuous throughout construction and operation. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation is planned and expected to re- establish natural processes and ecosystems that support hunted species and access will be restored following the AMP. Ecological and social context is sensitive because K\u00e1\u00ednai Natio n noted that past present activities have placed hunting already at moderate to high risk, and hunted spec ies that occur in the Project area remain important sources of food for members of K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation (Carlson et Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 79 Table 6.7-2a Description and characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physi cal and Cultural Heritage for the K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Trapping 1. Trapped species and habitat: The Project will have temporary effects on land access for traditional resource use and on the distribution and abundance of species trapped for traditional purposes. Species preferring recently disturbed and young habitats are expected to return first, followed by species preferring increasingly older habitat types with reclamation. Canada Lynx: There is a loss of lynx habitat in the WLSA. The loss of effective habitat, along with sensory disturbances associated with the Project, will likely displace lynx to other more suitable undisturbed habitats located west, north and east of the WLSA. Canada lynx rarely use the area around the access road, so it is not expected to have significant effects on lynx movement. American Marten: There will be a temporary, long -term loss of habitat for American marten. Reclamation of disturbed areas will occur throughout and after the life of the Project; however, American martens prefer mature to old- growth coniferous forests, which will take many decades to become re- established. East- west movements of American marten will likely be affected by the Project footprint since they tend to avoid open landscapes. The access road and coal conveyor will also likely affect marten movements. North -south marten movements along Blairmore and Gold Creeks should be relatively unaffected by Project development. With mitigation, Project effects on American marten habitat availability and movement in the WLSA are expected to be local in extent, extended in duration, continuous in frequency, reversible in the long -term, moderate in magnitude for habitat availability and low for movement (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.3.6.1, CIAR #42). Wildlife Residual Effects (EIA, CR#9, Table 5.3-26, CIAR #42): Effects on habitat availability for trapped species (lynx, American marten) due to vegetation clearing and sensory disturbance (due to increased noise, odour, visual disturbance) are moderate magnitude, negative Project contribution, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife movement for trapped species (lynx, American marten) due to construction and operation are low magnitude, and reversible in the long-term. Effects on wildlife abundance for trapped species (lynx, American marten) in hunting locations due to is low magnitude, negative Project contribution and, for American marten, reversible in the lon g-term and for the Canada lynx, reversible in the short term . Effects on wildlife mortality risk for trapped species (lynx, American marten) due to construction activities, vehicle collisions, and human -wildlife conflicts are low magnitude, frequency is occasional, and reversible in the short term. 2. Use or access to trapping locatio ns and harvesting methods: Where Project construction and operations activities overlap with hunting and trapping locations, access to active mining areas may be limited until they are reclaimed and safe. Indigenous groups will continue to have access to hunting and trapping locations where safety is not compromised (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). The Project's access restrictions within the mine permit area may also affect Indigenous groups' ability to use their preferred harvesting methods and seasonal rounds by altering the times of year that Indigenous groups have access to areas of interest for hunting/trapping within the mine permit area (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). Loss or disruption of traplines or trails used for trapping and loss of access to trapping locations may occur due to the mine site and road closure during construction and operation. The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as moderate magnitude. Increased noise, odour , and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of locations and the experience of hunting within the vicinity of the Project (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89); residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust ( EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42): The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified trapped species and habitat, change use or access to identified trapping locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on trapping for K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation due reduction or loss of trapping opportunities and the change in trapping methods could a ffect the cultural and spiritual relationship between the Nation and their territory, which is addressed below. Residual effects on trapping are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to trap for the K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation in the area but this does not change the ability to trap in the RSA. The K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation have noted that trapping may occur today in and around the Project area for both subsistence and ceremonial purposes (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 4.3.1.2, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency because loss of trapping opportunities will be continuous throughout construction and operation. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation is planned and expected to re -establish natural processes and ecosystems that support trapped species andaccess will be restored following the AMP. Ecological and social context is sensitive because K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation noted that past present activities, particularly mining, have placed trapping already at risk (Carlson et al. 2018; Addendum 10, JRP IR -4.6, Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 80 Table 6.7-2a Description and characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physi cal and Cultural Heritage for the K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Fishing 1. Fishing species and habitat: Westslope Cutthroat Trout (WSCT) The physical footprint of surface water management infrastructure and open pits will cause permanent change to WSCT habitat. The loss of riparian and aquatic habitat will be reversed by gains achieved through implementing an Offsetting Plan approved by DF O. The magnitude of this effect will be moderate, the duration is long, the frequency will be continuous, however, reversibility is characterized as reversible in the long -term. (Addendum 1, CR#6, Section 4.5, CIAR #44). Changes in hydrology will cause alteration in WSCT aquatic habitat of Gold and Blairmore creeks. The alteration of habitat will be offset by gains achieved thr ough implementing an Off setting Plan approved by DFO. The magnitude of residual adverse effects will be moderate, the duration is extended, the frequency will be continuous, however, reversibility is characterized as reversible in the long -term. (Addendum 1, CR#6, Section 4.5, C IAR#44). 2. Use or access to fishing locations and harvesting methods: Current access to the portions of the watercourses adjacent to Grassy Mountain is located on Benga private land. During construction and operation phases of the mine, this road will be closed to the general public, and alternate routes will need to be used to access and fish those portions of Blairmore and Gold Creeks (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.2.1.2, CIAR #89) which will be managed via the AMP. Loss or disruption of trails for accessing fishing locations due to the mine site and road closure during construction and operation. The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as moderate magnitude. Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of fishing locations by Indigenous N ations and preferred harvesting method. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1 CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to identified fishing locations, and change in preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on fishing for K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation due to reduction in fishing opportunities, engagement in fishing, and fishing success during construction and operation due to loss of access of fishing locations and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on fishing are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate. The K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation have advised they have fishing interests in the Project area and identified species, inclu ding Westslope Cutthroat trout (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 4.3.2.3, CIAR #251). There is predicted to be a change in the ability to fish for K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation. Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because access restrictions will apply beyond the life of the mine in some areas that may affectaccess to fishing locations. Continuous frequency because loss of fishing opportunitieswill be continuous throughout construction and operation. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation and offsetting is planned and expected maintain the fish population and access will be restored following the AMP. Ecological and social context is resilient because the K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation engage in fishing primarily outside the Project LSA in the Crowsnest River watershed and Old Man River watershed north of the LSA and not in close proximity to industrial sites and other features used for non- TLU purposes (Section 4.3.1.3, Addendum 10; Carlson et al. 2018). The Project area overlaps existing industry which has alreadyresulted in change in fishing. Therefore, Kainai Nation engagement in fishing is not sensitive to disruption from theProject. Plant Gathering 1. Plant species and habitat: The Project will result in loss of traditional use of vegetation within the vegetation local study area. Residual effects to TEK vegetation are local, long -term in duration, continuous, reversible and high magnitude. The Project will have a neutral contribution with respect to valued species and communities. After reclamation, the reclaimed land will support a range of communities with equivalent capabilities to those of the surrounding lands and that existing prior to Project development. Residual adverse effects on vegetation were assessed as high magnitude for rare plants, community diversity, and TEK species, low magnitude for forest, and moderate for wetlands (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). Duration of effects on vegetation will be extended. Reclaimed land will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports traditional use plants (EIA, CR#8 , Section 4.1, CIAR #42). Frequency of effects on vegetation, including rare plants and rare plant communities and traditional ecological knowledge, will be continuous through the operational phase of the project and cease only after reclamation is completed (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). Effects on vegetation are reversible in the long -term with the implementation of progressive reclamation (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). 2. Use or access to plant gathering locations and harvesting methods: Loss or disr uption of trails, loss of access to plant gathering locations, and loss of preferred methods for plant gathering due to the mine site and access road. Residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as moderate magnitude. Residual adverse effects o n air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of plant gathering locations by Indigenous Nations and preferred harvesting method. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 3 5 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3 CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified plant gathering species and habitat, change use or access to identified harvesting locations, and change in preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on plant gathering for K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation due to reduction in harvesting opportunities, engagement in plant gathering, and harvesting su ccess during construction and operation due to loss of access of plant gathering locations and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on plant gathering are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate. The K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation have identified habitat and species for plant gathering in the proximity of the Project (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 4.3.2.3, CIAR #251). There is predicted to be a change in the ability to gather plants for K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation. Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency due to continu ous mine disturbance (loss of vegetation, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation (of terrain, soil, vegetation) is planned andexpected to re- establish natural processes and ecosystems that support traditional use plants (high density planting ofdisease- resistant whitebark pine seedlings will contribute to the successful re- establishment of the native ecosystem); and, access to plant gathering locations will be re -established after mine closure. Ecological and social context is sensitive because engagement in plant gathering is sensitive to disruption and past and present activities have resulted in traditional land use at high risk (Carlson et al. 2018; Addendum 10, JRP IR-4.6, CIAR #251).BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 81 Table 6.7-2a Description and characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physi cal and Cultural Heritage for the K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Trails and Travelways 1. Use or access to trails and travelways: Loss or disruption of trails and travelways due to the mine site and access road. The Project will have residual adverse effects on use of trails and travelways because the Project could result in loss of trails and travelways that are fully or partially within the mine permit boundary. The Project footprint will be reclaimed to land use capability equivalent to pre- mining; however, it will not be accessible for use as trails and travelways during construction and operations. Access to areas around the Project will be possible using existing trails from Highway 40 to reach the area west of Blairmore Creek and Crown Land north of the Project and from either the north or the south along the Gold Creek. With the implementation of the AMP, potential residual effects will be further reduced as Benga will be providing access to adjacent privately owned Benga lands for traditional practices (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 4.3.3.5, CIAR #251). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting , and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of trails and travelways by Indigenous Nations. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours fr om NO2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). 2. Features associated with trails and travelways: Loss or disturbance to features associated with trails and travelways due to the mine site and access road. Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude after reclamation (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but will be limited to within the zone of influence (generally 1.5 km) for noise, visual disturbance, and effect on access (EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). The geographic extent of residual effects on historical resources and on land and resource use is characterized as local (EIA, CR#10, Section E, CIAR #42). The frequency of impact on access and utilities in the lands and resource use is continuous (EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). The fr equency of impact of noise and other disturbances to trail use will continue throughout the Project lifespan (EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access and change preferred trails and travelways. There will be residual effects on trails and travelways for K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation due to restriction in use or access, and engagement with features associated with trails and travelways during construction and operation due to loss of access to trails and travelways locations, sensory disturbance, and change in use within the mine permit area. Residual effects on trails and travelways is characterized as: Magnitude is moderate. The Project will intersect or be in proximity to territory that has been identified as trails or travelways by the K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 4.3.2.5, CIAR #251). There is predicted to be a change in the ability to use or access trailsand travelways for K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation. Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency during construction and operation dueto continuous mine disturbance (loss of vegetation, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Non- reversible where trails and travelways are lost because when a trail is inaccessible it will not be maintained or used, resulting in the potential loss of the knowledge of or loss of the physical trail or travelway. Ecological and social context is resilient because the K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation can use alternative routes to travel between cultural and spiritual sites and resources within their traditional territory (Section 4.3.1.5, Appendix 4.1-1, Addendum 10). Therefore, K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation use and access to trails andtravelways is not sensitive to disruption from the Pr oject. Cultural an d Spiritual Values 1. Use of and access to sacred important sites with cultural or spiritual value: Residual adverse effects on access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42). Loss or disruption of tr ails to important sites due to the mine site and access road. Loss of hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering opportunities. The residual effects, as seen above, on hunting, trapping and plant gathering were assess ed as moderate magnitude. Increas e in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation, which could affect use and enjoyment of culturally and spiritually important sites. Increased noise levels extend 1.5 km from the Project (EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). 2. Experience of engaging with sites of cultural or spiritual value: Loss or disturbance to important sites due to the mine site and access road. Loss of experience in hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering, which could affect the cultural and spiritual relationships with the resource. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation, which could affect enjoyment or experience of using culturally and spiritually important sites. 3. Cultural values associated with sites/features: Loss of hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering opportuni ties, which could affect intergenerational teaching of traditional practices, and result in loss of cultural identity, sense of place, and human health/well- being. Loss of access to sites/features due to construction and operation activities. Loss of or da mage to unique sites and special features as a result of clearing and construction activities. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation, which could affect enjoyment or experience of engaging with the sites/features of cultural or spiritual value. In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to sites with cultural or spiritual value, change the experience of using these sites, and change the cultural value associated with sites and features. There will be residual effects on cultural and spiritual values for K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation during construction and operation due to loss of or access to culturally or spiritually important sites and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effect on cultural and spiritual values is characterized as: Magnitude is moderate. The K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation indicated that the Project area is highly significant and culturally important (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 4.3.3.6, CIAR #251). The K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation has also stated the Project footprint would destroy documented and undocumented sites of cultural and spiritual significance (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 4.3.2.6, CIAR #251). There is predicted to be a change in the values associated with cultural or spiritual sites for the K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation. Local geographic extent because residual effects will extendbeyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because the loss of experience in hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering could affect the long- term cultural and spiritual relationships between Indigenous groups and their resources and territory. Change in land useand access will extend beyond the Project lifespan. Continuous frequency due to continuous mine distur bance (loss of vegetation, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Non- reversible because loss of cultural and spiritual sites and experience in engaging in land use could result in loss of the knowledge of cultural and spiritual values. Ecological and social context is sensitive because loss of engagement in land use affects cultural identity, human well- being and relationships, and intergenerational transfer ofknowledge. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 82 Table 6.7-2a Description and characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physi cal and Cultural Heritage for the K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage 1. Physical and cultural heritage: Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage as a result of clearing and construction activities. The geographic extent of residual effects on historical resources is local (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). 2. Access to physical and cultural heritage: Loss or disruption of trails to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage due to the mine site and access road. The magnitude of effects on trails and travelways was characterized as moderate. 3. Cultural value and importance associated with physical and cultural heritage: Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during cons truction and operation could result in reduced engagement with the sites/features of cultural value. Magnitude was assessed as high for TEK plant species (EIA, CR#8, CIAR #42), whereas magnitude is low to moderate for hunted and trapped wildlife (EIA, CR#9, CIAR #42). Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage as a result of clearing and construction activities. The magnitude of effects on cultural and spiritual values was characterized as moderate. 4. Relationship with physical and cultural heritage: Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42) and access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42), bu t for those VCs that affect the relationships with physical and cultural heritage ( e.g., air quality, noise, plant gathering, hunting and trapping), magnitude is assessed as high for odour and low to moderate for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1 CIAR #42), and moderate for hunting, trapping and plant gathering. Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage as a result of clearing and construction activities could result in loss of relationship with heritage. Loss of hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering opportunities due to construction and operation and access restrictions could result in loss of relationship with wildlife and cultural practices. Increase in noise, odour, and visual distur bance during construction and operation could result in reduced engagement with the sites/features associated with physical or cultural heritage. In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to physical and cultural heritage, change the value and importance, and change the relationship the K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation have with these sites. There will be residual effects on Indigenous physical and cultural heritage for K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation during construction and operation due to loss of access and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on Indigenous Physical and cultural heritage are characterized as: Magn itude is moderate. The TKUA provided by the K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation specifies sites within the Project TLU LSA and RSA as significant for traditional material culture. The K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation field team visited thirteen (13) sites that relate to Indigenous physical and cultural heritage during Project site visits (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 4.4.1, CIAR #251). There is predicted to be a change in the access to and value of physical and cultural heritage for the K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation. Local geographic extent because residual effects will extendbeyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because disturban ce to or loss of unique sites and features will extend beyond the Project lifespan. Regular frequency because disturbance to unique sites and features will occur during construction and operation activities whenever sites or features are discovered. Non- reversible because loss of heritage sites and features and experience in engaging in land use could result in loss of the knowledge of cultural her itage. Ecological and social context is sensitive because K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation identified the Project LSA as significant for traditional material culture, such as material for knives and arrowheads (O'Connor, 2018; Addendum 10, JRP IR -4.6, CIAR #251), and loss of heritage sites and features or loss of engagement with physical and cultural heritage could affect culturalidentity, human well- being, and intergenerational transfer of knowledge.

A summary table of this characterization was provided as Table 5.4.4-1 (Appendix 4.1-1: An Updated Assessment of the Potential Effects of the G rassy Mountain Project on Indigenous Groups , Addendum 10, CIAR#251), and is copied below for the convenience of the reader, as Table 6.7-3b. The results of the characterization are not changed from the conclusions reached in Appendix 4.1-1. Table 6.7-3a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Piikani Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Eff ects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Hunting 1. Hunted species and habitat: The Project will have temporary effects on land access for traditional resource use and on the distribution and abundance of species hunted for traditional purposes. Species preferring recently disturbed and young habitats are expected to return first, follo wed by species preferring increasingly older habitat types with reclamation. Moose and Elk: Suitable moose and elk habitat will decline initially but is predicted to be more abundant than baseline levels by end of mine due, in part, to reclamation of legacy mine sites that overlap the Project footprint (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.6.2.1, CIAR #42). The changes in abundance of moose and elk year -round in the WLSA are expected to follow a similar pattern as individuals of both species will be displaced into adjacent habitats. Grizzly Bear: Highly suitable grizzly bear habitat in the WLSA will decrease initially during the construction and operation phases and then increase throughout the duration of progressive reclamation. Mortality risk also increases with Project development but then decreases with progressive reclamation. With reclamation, the Project footprint is expected to offer more suitable habitat (dietary resources) and lower mortality risk than under baseline conditions, which are anticipated to allow for an increase in the size of the grizzly bear population that the local area can support. Wildlife Residual Effects (EIA, CR#9, Table 5.3-26, CIAR #42): Effects on habitat availability for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) due to vegetation clearing and sensory disturbance (due to increased noise, odour, visual disturbance) are low magnitude, positive Project contribution, and reversible in the lo ng-term. Effects on wildlife movement for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) due to construction and operation are low magnitude, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife abundance for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) in hunting location is low magnitude, positive Project contribution for elk and grizzly bear, neutral Project con tribution for moose, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife mortality risk for hunted species due to construction activities, vehicle coll isions, and human- wildlife conflicts are low magnitude, frequency is occasional, and reversible in the long- term. With the Access Control Policy and firearm prohibition by Project personnel, poaching and non -Indigenous hunting of moose, elk, and grizzly bear will decline in the WLSA during the life of mine and may result in increased abundance of moose, elk, and grizzly bear in the areas accessible by Indigenous groups (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.6.2.1, CIAR #42). A screening level wildlife risk assessment was conducted, the results of which indicate that there is no potential risk of adverse effects associated with Project emissions on the health of wildlife in the study areas(Addendum 10, Appendix 4.9-1, Section 8.0, Updated Human Health and Wildlife Screening Risk Assessment, CIAR #251) . The wildlife risk assessment was amended to include an evaluation of water -based exposure pathways (both groundwater and surface water) and the results presented for Blairmore Creek, Gold Creek and the Oldman Reservoir were not considered to be indicative of adverse effects (Addendum 11, JRP IR -6.28). For the proposed end pit lake (EPL) (at closure), the results of the risk assessment are not considered indicative of a human health concern; however, management considerations of the EPL are warranted and actual measured concentrations at the time of EPL creation should be used to revisit predicted effects (Addendum 11, JRP IR -6.27). The assessment includes an Indigenous-specific conceptual model, which describes sourcepathway linkages between the Project and Indigenous use of all aquatic pathways including the end pit lake, Blairmore and Gold Creeks, the Crowsnest River and the Oldman Reservoir in the post closure landscape. 2. Use or access to hunting locations and harvesting methods: Where Project construction and operations activities overlap with hunting locations, access to active mining areas may be limited until they are reclaimed and safe. Indigenous groups will continue to have access tohunting and trapping locations where safety is not compromised (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). The Project's access restrictions within the mine permit area may also affect Indigenous groups' ability to use their preferred harvesting methods and seasonal rounds by altering the times of year that Indigenous groupshave access to areas of interest for hunting within the mine permit area (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.2 CIAR #89). The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as moderate magnitude (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, and visual distur bance during construction and operation could affect use of locations and the experience of hunting within the vicinity of th e Project (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89); residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42): The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). Where Indigenous gr oups utilize firearms for hunting, the Project's firearms restriction policy would affect their ability to use that harvesting method within the mine footprint. Alternate h unting methods may be possible in parts of the mine footprint that have not yet been disturbed or which have been reclaimed under the AMP (Addendum 8, Appendix a- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.3, CIAR #89). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified hunted species and habitat, change use or access to identified hunting locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on hunting for Piikani Nation due to reduction in hunting opportunities, engagemen t in hunting, and hunting success during construction and operation due to loss of access of hunting locations, sensory disturbance, and change in wildlife use within the mine permit area. Residual effects on hunting are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to hunt but it will not affect the ability to hunt in the RSA. For the Piikani Nation, huntingoccurs for subsistence as well as for medicinal and ceremonial purposes such as f or use in bundle and Sundance ceremonies, and they have identified wildlife sites used for hunting that partially or fully overlap the LSA (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 5.3.1.1, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some areas. Continu ous frequency because loss of hunting opportunities will be continuous throughout construction and operation. Reversible because reclamation is planned and expected to re- establish natural processes and ecosystems that support hunted species and access will be restored following the AMP. Ecological and social context is sensitive because hunted species that occur in the Project area remain important sources of food for members of Piikani Nation and because loss of hunting as a traditional practice has low resiliency to disruption for future generations .BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 85 Table 6.7-3a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Piikani Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Eff ects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Trapping 1.Trapped species and habitat: The Pro ject will have temporary effects on land access for traditional resource use and on the distribution and abundance of species trapped for traditional purposes. Species preferring recently disturbed and young habitats are expected to return first, f ollowed by species preferring increasingly older habitat types with reclamation. Canada Lynx: There is a loss of lynx habitat in the WLSA. The loss of effective habitat, along with sensory disturbances associated with the Project, will likely displace ly nx to other more suitable undisturbed habitats located west, north and east of the WLSA. Canada lynx rarely use the area around the access road, so it is not expected to have significan t effects on lynx movement. American Marten: There will be a temporary, long -term loss of habitat for American marten. Reclamation of disturbed areas will occur throughout and after the life of the Project; however, American martens prefer mature to old- growth coniferous forests, which will take many decades to become re-establish ed. East -west movements of American marten will likely be affects by the Project footprint since they tend to avoid open landscapes. The access road and coal conveyor will also likely affect marten movements. North- south marten movements along Blairmore and Gold Creeks should be relatively unaffected by Project development. With mitigation, Project effects on American marten habitat availability and movement in the WLSA are expected to be local in extent, extended in duration, continuous in frequency, r eversible in the long -term, moderate in magnitude for habitat availability and low for movement (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.3.6.1, CIAR #42). Wildlife Residual Effects (EIA, CR#9, Table 5.3-26, CIAR #42): Effects on habitat availability for trapped species (lynx, American marten) due to vegetation clearing and sensory disturbance (due to increased noise, odour, visual disturbance) are moderate magnitude, negative Project contribution, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife movement for trapped species (lynx, American marten) due to construction and operation are low magnitude, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife abundance for trapped species (lynx, American marten) in hunting locations due to is low magnitude, negative Project contribution and, for American marten, reversible in the long -term and for the Canada lynx, reversible in the short term . Effects on wildlife mortality risk for trapped species (lynx, American marten) due to construction activities, vehicle collisions, and human -wildlife conflicts are low magnitude, frequency is occasional, and reversible in the short term. 2.Use or access to trapping locations and harvesting methods: Where Project construction and operations activities overlap with hunting and trapping locations, access to active mining areas may be limited until they are reclaimed and safe. Indigenous groups will continue to have access to hunting and trapping locations where safety is not compromised (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CEAR #89). The Project's access restrictions within the mine permit area may also affect Indigenous groups' ability to use their preferred harvesting methods and seasonal rounds by altering the times of year that Indigenous groups have access to areas of interest for hunting/trapping within the mine permit area (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). Loss or disruption of traplines or trails used for trapping and loss of access to trapping locations due to the mine site and road closure during construction and operation. The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as moderate magnitude. Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of locations and the experience of hunting within the vicinity of the Project (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89); residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42): The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odo urs from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified trapped species and habitat, change use or access to identified trapping locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on trapping for Piikani Nation due to reduction or loss of trapping opportunities and the change in trapping methods could affect the cultural and spiritual relationship between the Nation and their territory, as described below. Residual effects on trapping are characterized as: Magnitude is low because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to trap in the Project area but it will not affect the ability to trap in the RSA. The Piikani Consultation Team has not identified an interest in trapping in the Project area (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 5.3.1.2, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency because loss of trapping opportunities will be continuousthroughout construction and operation. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation is planned andexpected to re- establish natural processes and ecosystems that support trapped species and access will be restored following the AMP. Ecological and social context is unknown due to lack of information from Piikani Nation regarding sensitivity to changes to trapping. For the purposes of this evaluationit has been rated as sensitive in line with the conclusion for hunting.

The loss of riparian and aquatic habitat will be reversed by gains achieved through implementing an Offsetting Plan approved by DFO. The magnitude of this effect will be moderate, the duration is long, the frequency will be continuous, however, reversibility is characterized as reversible in the long- term (Addendum 1, CR#6, Section 4.5, CIAR #44). Changes in hydrology will cause alteration in WSCT aquatic habitat of Gold and Blairmore creeks. The alteration of habitat will be offset by gains achieved thro ugh impl ementing an Offsetting Plan approved by DFO. The magnitude of residual adverse effects will be moderate, the duration is extended, the frequency will be continuous, however, reversibility is characterized as reversible in the long -term (Addendum 1, CR#6, Section 4.5, CIAR #44). 2.Use or access to fishing locations and harvesting methods: Current access to the portions of the watercourses adjacent to Grassy Mountain is located on Benga private land. During construction and operation phases of the mine, this road will be closed to the general public, and alternate routes will need to be used to access and fish those portions of Blairmore and Gold Creeks (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.2.1.2, CIAR #89) which will be managed via the AMP. Loss or disruption of trails for accessing fishing locations due to the mine site and road closure during construction and operation. The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as moderate magnitude. Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of fi shing location s by Indigenous Nations and preferred harvesting method. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, S ection 5.1 CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to identified fishing locations and change in preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on fishing for Piikani Nation due to reduction in fishing opportunities, engagement in fishing, and fishing success during construction and operation due to loss of access of fishing locations and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on fishing are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to fishfor Piikani Nation in the Project area but it will not affect the ability to fish in the RSA. The Piikani Nation have advised that they have a fishing interest in the Project area and identified species, including Westslope Cutthroat trout, which Project effects were assessed as moderate magnitude. Members currently fish in streams and lakes near the reserve primarily for sport. These areas are outside of the Project LSA(Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 5.3.1.3 and Section 5.3.2.3 CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because access restrictions will apply beyond the life of the mine in some areas that may affect access to fishing locations. Continuous frequency because loss of fishing opportunities will be continuous throughout construction and operation. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation and offsetting isplanned and expected to maintain fish populations and access will be restored following the AMP. Ecological and social context is sensitive because the Piikani Nation have expressed a concern with changes to fish species and habitat, fishing locations and harvestingmethods; therefore, change in fishing may be sensitive to disruption. The Piikani Nation noted that they began harvesting fish as a means of subsistence after the extirpation of bison (Addendum 1.Plant species and habitat: The Project will result in loss of traditional use of vegetation within the vegetation local study area. Residual effects to TEK vegetation are local, long- term in duration, continuous, reversible and high magnitude. The Project will have a neutral contribution with respect to valued species and communities. After reclamation, the reclaimed land will support a range of communities with equivalent capabilities to those of the surrounding lands and that existing prior to Project development. Residual adverse effects on vegetation were assessed as high magnitude for rare plants, community diversity, and TEK species, low magnitude for forest, and moderate for wetlands (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). Duration of effects on vegetation will be extended. Reclaimed land will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports traditional use plants (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.1, CIAR #42). Frequency of effects on vegetation, including rare plants and rare plant communities and traditional ecological knowledge, will be continuous through the opera tional phase of the project and cease only after reclamation is completed (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). Effects on vegetation are reversible in the long -term with the implementation of progressive reclamation (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). 2.Use or access to plant gathering locations and harvesting methods: Loss or disruption of trails, loss of access to plant gathering locations, and loss of and preferred methods for plant gathering due to the mine site and access road. Residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as moderate magnitude. Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and ope ration could affect use of plant gathering locations by Indigenous Nations and preferred harvesting method. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42,). Odour (mostly NO2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3 CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified plant gathering species and habitat, change use or access to identified harvesting locations, and change in preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on plant gathering for Piikani Nation due to reduction in harvesting opportunities, engagement in plant gathering, and harvesting success during construction and operation due to loss of access of plant gathering locations and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on plant gathering are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to gather plants for Piikani Nation in the Project area. The Piikani Nation have identifiedhabitat and species for plant gathering in the Project LSA (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 5.3.2.4, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency due to continuous mine disturbance (loss of vegetat ion, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation (of terrain, soil, vegetation) is planned and expected to re- establish natural processes and ecosystems that support traditional use plants (high density planting of disease- resistant whitebark pine seedlings will contribute to the successful re- establishment of the native ecosystem); and, access to plant gathering locations will be re -established after mine closure. Ecological and social context is sensitive because engagement in plant gathering is sensitive to disruption and past and present activities have resulted in traditional landuse assessed as high risk. The Piikani Nation have noted that in and around the Projectarea, there are plant species crucial to Piikani ceremony, healing practices, andspirituality that are not found at lower elevations where the majority of the community resides (Carlson et al. 2018; Addendum 10, JRP IR -4.6, CIAR #251).BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 87 Table 6.7-3a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Piikani Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Eff ects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Trails and Travelways 1.Use or access to trails and travelways: Loss or disruption of trails and travelways due to the mine site and access road. The Project will have residual adverse effects on use of trails and travelways because the Project could result in loss of trails and travelways that are fully or partially within the mine permit boundary. The Project footprint will be reclaimed to land use capability equivalent to pre- mining; however, it will not be accessible for use as trails and travelways during construction and operations. Access to areas around the Project will be possible using existing trails from Highway 40 to reach the area west of Blairmore Creek and Crown Land north of the Project and from either the north or the south along the Gold Creek. With the implementation of the AMP, potential residual effects will be further reduced as Benga will be providing access to adjacent privately owned Benga lands for traditional practices (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 5.3.3.5, CIAR #251). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation coul d affect use of trails and travelways by Indigenous Nations. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA with in 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR# 2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). 2.Features associated with trails and travelways: Loss or dist urbance to features associated with trails and travelways due to the mine site and access road. Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude after reclamation (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dus t (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to within the zone of influence (generally 1.5 km) for noise, visual disturbance, and effect on access (EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). The geographic extent of residual effects on historical resources and on land and resource use is characterized as local (EIA, CR#10, Section E, CIAR #42). The frequency of impact on access and utilities in the lands and resource use is continuous (EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). The frequency of impact of noise and other disturbances to trail use will continue throughout the Project lifespan (EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access and change preferred trails and travelways. There will be residual effects on trails and travelways for Piikani Nation due to restriction in use or access, and engagement with features associates with trails and travelways during construction and operation due to loss of access to trails and travelways locations, sensory disturbance, and change in use within the mine permit area. Residual effects on trails and travelways is characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to use or access trails and travelways for Piikani Nation as the Project will intersect or be in proximity to territory that is identified for trails and travelways by the Piikani Nationand cultural heritage sites associated with these trails. However, it will not affect the ability to use trails and travelways in the RSA (Ad dendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 5.3.2.5, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency due to continuous mine disturbance (loss of vegetation, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Non- reversi ble where trails and travelways are lost because when a trail is inaccessible it will not be maintained or used, resulting in the potential loss of the knowledge of or loss of the physical trail or travelway. Ecological and social context is resilient because, although Piikani Nation identified trails and travelways within the LSA (Addendum Appendix 4.1-1, Section 5.3.1.5 and Section 5.3.2.5, CIAR #251), they can use alternative routes to travel between cultural and spiritual sites and resources within their traditional territory. Therefore, Piikani Nation use and access to trails and travelways is not sensitive to disruption from the Project. Cultural and Spiritual Values 1.Use of and access to sacred important sites with cultural or spiritual value: Residual adverse effects on access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42). Loss or disruption of trails to important sites due to the mine site and access road. Loss of hunting, trapping, f ishing, and plant gathering opportunities. The residual effects, as seen above, on hunting, trapping and plant gathering were assessed as moderate magnitude. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation, whi ch could affect use and enjoyment of culturally and spiritually important sites. Increased noise levels extend 1.5 km from the Project (EIA, CR#2, CIAR#42). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lightin g, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). 2.Experience of engaging with sites of cultural or spiritual value: Loss o r disturbance to important sites due to the mine site and access road. Loss of experience in hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering, which could affect the cultural and spiritual relationships with the resource. Increase in noise, odour, and visua l disturbance during construction and operation, which could affect enjoyment or experience of using culturally and spiritually important sites. 3.Cultural values associated with sites/features: Loss of hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering opportunities, which could affect intergenerational teaching of traditional practices, and result in loss of cultural identity, sense of place, and human health/well-being. Loss of access to sites/features due to construction and operation activities. Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features as a result of clearing and construction activities. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation, which could affect enjoyment or experience of engaging with the sites/features of cultural or spiritual value. In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to sites with cultural or spiritual value, change the experience of using these sites, and change the cultural value associated with sites and features. There will be residual effects on cultural and spiritual values for Piikani Nation during construction and operation due to loss of or access to culturally or spiritually important sites and sensory disturbance within the mine permit a rea. Residual effect on cultural and spiritual values is characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the values adexperience associated with cultural or spiritual sites for the Piikani Nation throughdirect disturbance and change in noise and air quality. However, this will not affect the ability to use or access sites associated with cultural and spiritual values in the RSA. The Piikani Nation have stories that are connected with Grassy M ountain such as cultural and spiritual knowledge, cultural practices, and TEK, which is passed down in areas throughout their territory (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 5.3.1.6, CIAR #251). In addition to a direct change to cultural and spiritual values and associated features, it is expected that the visual and sensory experience of visitingthese locations will also change. The Project will cause a certain change in noise, dust and a visual disturbance (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 5.3.2.6, CIAR #251). The Piikani Nation has also stated the Project footprint would destroy documented and undocumented sites of cultural and spiritual significance; however, the Nation did not identify specific sites (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 5.3.2.6, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because the loss of experience in hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering could affect the long -term cultural and spiritual relationships between Indigenous groups and their resources and territory. Change in land use and accesswill extend beyond the Project lifespan. Continuous frequency due to continuous mine disturbance (loss of vegetation, accessrestrictions, noise, visual) thr oughout life of mine. Non- reversible because loss of cultural and spiritual sites and experience in engaging in land use could result in loss of the knowledge of cultural and spiritual values. Ecological and social context is sensitive because loss of engagement in land use affects cultural identity, human well- being and relationships, and intergenerational transfer of knowledge.

The geographic extent of residual effects on historical resources is local (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). 2.Access to physical and cultural heritage: Loss or disruption of trails to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage due to the mine site and access road. The magnitude of effects on trails and travelways was characterized as moderate. 3.Cultural value and importance associated with physical and cultural heritage: Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could result in reduced engagement with the sites/features of cultural value. Magnitude was assessed as high for TEK plant species (EIA, CR#8, CIAR #42), whereas magnitude is low to moderate for hunted and trapped wildlife (EIA, CR#9, CIAR #42). Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage as a result of clearing and construction activities. The magnitude of effects on cultural and spiritual values was characterized as moderate. 4.Relationship with physical and cultural heritage: Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42) and ac cess and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42), but for those VCs that affect the relationships with physical and cultural heritage ( e.g., air quality, noise, p lant gathering, hunting and trapping), magnitude is assessed as high for odour and low to moderate for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1 CIAR #42), and moderate for hunting, trapping and plant gathering. Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage as a result of clearing and construction activities could result in loss of relationship with heritage. Loss of hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering opportunities due to construction and operati on and access restrictions could result in loss of relationship with wildlife and cultural practices. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could result in reduced engagement with the sites/features associated with physical or cultural heritage. In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to physical and cultural heritage, change the value and importance, and change the relationship the K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation have with these sites. There will be residual effects on Indigenous physical and cultural heritage for Piikani Nation during construction and operation due to loss of access and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on Indigenous Physical and cultural heritage are characterized as: Magnitu de is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the access to and value of physical and cultural heritage for the Piikani Nation. The Piikani Nationidentified four cultural heritage sites; however, the specific locations of these siteswere not provided to Benga. Therefore, it is anticipated that the Project may affect access and use of these sites (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 5.3.2. 5, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because disturbance to or loss of unique sites and features will extend beyond the Project lifespan. Regular frequency because disturbance to unique sites and features will occur duringconstruction and operation activities whenever sites or features are discovered. Non- reversible because loss of heritage sites and features and experience in engaging in land use could result in loss of the knowledge of cultural heritage. Ecological and social context is sensitive because loss of heritage sites and features orloss of engagement with physical and cultural heritage affects cultural identity, humanwell- being and relationships, and intergenerational transfer of knowledge. The Piikani Nation noted that historic mining within their territory had disturbed the \"few remnants of Piikani presence\" BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 89 In summary, the residual effects characterization has not changed from that already provided.

A summary table of this characterization was provided as Table 6.4.4-1 (Appendix 4.1-1: An Updated Assessment of the Potential Effects of the Grassy Mountain Project on Indigenous Groups , Addendum 10, CIAR#251), and is copied below for the convenience of the reader, as Table 6.7-4b. Table 6.7-4a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Siks ika Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Hunting 1. Hunted species and habitat: The Project will have temporary effects on land access for traditional resource use and on the distribution and abundance of species hunted for traditional purposes. Species preferring recently disturbed and young habitats are expected to return first, followed by species preferring increasingly older habitat types with reclamation. Moose and Elk: Suitable moose and elk habitat will decline initially but is predicted to be more abundant than baseline levels by end of mine due, in part, to reclamation of legacy mine sites that overlap the Project footprint (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.6.2.1, CIAR#42). The changes in abundance of moose and elk year -round in the WLSA are expected to follow a similar pattern as individuals of both species will be displaced into adjacent habitats. Grizzly Bear: Highly suitable grizzly bear habitat in the WLSA will decrease initially during the construction and operation phases and then increase throughout the duration of progressive reclamation. Mortality risk also increases with Project development but then decreases with progressive reclamation. With reclamation, the Project footprint is expected to offer more suitable habitat (dietary resources) and lower mortality risk than under baseline conditions, which are anticipated to allow for an increase in the size of the grizzly bear population that the local area can support. Wildlife Residual Effects (EIA, CR#9, Table 5.3-26, CIAR #42): Effects on habitat availability for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) due to vegetation clearing and sensory disturbance (due to increased noise, odour, visual disturbance) are low magnitude, positive Project contribution, and reversible in the lo ng-term. Effects on wildlife movement for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) due to construction and operation are low magnitude, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wi ldlife abundance for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) in hunting location is low magnitude, positive Project contribution for elk and grizzly bear, neutral Project contribution for moose, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife mortality risk for hunted species due to construction activities, vehicle coll isions, and human- wildlife conflicts are low magnitude, frequency is occasional, and reversible in the long -term. With the Access Control Policy and firearm prohibition by Project per sonnel, poaching and non- Indigenous hunting of moose, elk, and grizzly bear will decline in the WLSA during the life of mine and may result in increased abundance of moose, elk, and grizzly bear in the areas accessible by Indigenous groups (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.6.2.1, CIAR #42). A screening level wildlife risk assessment was conducted, the results of which indicate that there is no potential risk of adverse effects associated with Project emissions on the health of wildlife in the study areas(Addendum 10, A ppendix 4.9-1, Section 8.0, Updated Human Health and Wildlife Screening Risk Assessment, CIAR #251) . The wildlife risk assessment was amended to include an evaluation of water -based exposure pathways (both groundwater and surface water) and the results presented for Blairmore Creek, Gold Creek and the Oldman Reservoir were not considered to be indicative of adverse effects (Addendum 11, JRP IR -6.28). For the proposed end pit lake (EPL) (at closure), the results of the risk assessment are not considered indicative of a human health concern; however, management considerations of the EPL are warranted and actual measured concentrations at the time of EPL creation should be used to revisit predicted effects (Addendum 11, JRP IR -6.27). The assessment includes an I ndigenous -specific conceptual model, which describes sourcepathway linkages between the Project and Indigenous use of all aquatic pathways including the end pit lake, Blairmore and Gold Creeks, the Crowsnest River and the Oldman Reservoir in the post closure landscape. 2. Use or access to hunting locations and harvesting methods: Where Project construction and operations activities overlap with hunting locations, access to active mining areas may be limited until they are reclaimed and safe. Indigenous groups will continue to have access to huntingand trapping locations where safety is not compromised (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). The Project's access restrictions within the mine permit area may also affect Indigenous groups' ability to use their preferred harvesting methods and seasonal rounds by altering the times of year that Indigenous groups have access to areas of interest for hunting within the mine permit area (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.2 CIAR #89). The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as moderate magnitude. Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of locations and the experi ence of hunting within the vicinity of the Project (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89); residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42): The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). Where Indigenous groups utilize firearms for hunting, the Project's firearms restriction policy would affect their ability to use that harvesting method within the mine footprint. Alternate hunting methods may be possible in parts of the mine footprint that have not yet been disturbed or which have been reclaimed under the AMP (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.3, CIAR #89). In summary, effects on li nked VCs will act synergistically to change identified hunted species and habitat, change use or access to identified hunting locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on hunting for Siksika Nation due to reduction in hunting opportunities, engagement in hunting, and hunting success during construction and operation due to loss of access of hunting locations, sensory disturbance, and change in wildlife use within the mine permit area. Residual effects on hunting are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the ability tohunt for the Siksika Nation in the area, but this does not change the ability to hunt inthe RSA. There are no specific hunting sites identified by the Siksika Nation in the Project LSA; however, Project activities will intersect or be in proximity to habitat and species that are identified for hunting by the Siksika Nation. The Siksika Nation continues to hunt throughout their traditional territory (Adden dum 10, Appendix 4.1- 1, Section 6.3.2.1, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyondlife of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency because loss of hunting opportunities will be continuousthroughout construction and operation. Revers ibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation is planned and expected to re- establish natural processes and ecosystems that support hunted species and access will be restored following the AMP. Ecological and social context is sensitive because Siksika Nation h ave noted a decline in the number of species, including elk and deer, limited accessibility due toprivate land ownership, non- traditional land use activities, and community members avoidance due to concerns about contamination, safety and overall negative experiences on the land. These issues have placed hunting at moderate to high risk and hunted species that occur in the Project area remain important sources of food for members of Siksika Nation (Carlson et al. 2018; Addendum 10, JRP IR-4.6, #251). BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 91 Table 6.7-4a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Siks ika Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Trapping 1. Trapped species and habitat: The Project will have temporary effects on land access for traditional resource use and on the distribution and abundance of species trapped for traditional purposes. Species preferring recently disturbed and young habitats are expected to return first, followed by species preferring increasingly older habitat types with reclamation. Canada Lynx: There is a loss of lynx habitat in the WLSA. The loss of effective habitat, along with sensory disturbances associated with the Project, will likely displace lynx to other more suitable undisturbed habitats located west, north and east of the WLSA. Canada lynx rarely use the area around the access road, so it is not expected to have significant effects on lynx movement. American Marten: There will be a temporary, long -term loss of habitat for American marten. Reclamation of disturbed areas will occur throughout and after the life of the Project; however, American martens prefer mature to old- growth coniferous forests, which will take man y decades to become re- established. East- west movements of American marten will likely be affects by the Project footprint since they tend to avoid open landscapes. The access road and coal conveyor will also likely affect marten movements. North- south marten movements along Blairmore and Gold Creeks should be relatively unaffected by Project development. With mitigation, Project effects on American marten habitat availability and movement in the WLSA are expected to be local in extent, extended in duration, continuous in frequency, reversible in the long- term, moderate in magnitude for habitat availability and low for movement (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.3.6.1, CIAR #42). Wildlife Residual Effects (EIA, CR#9, Table 5.3-26, CIAR #42): Effects on habitat availability for trapped species (lynx, American marten) due to vegetation clearing and sensory disturbance (due to increased noise, odour, visual disturbance) are moderate magnitude, negative Project contribution, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife movement for trapped species (lynx, American marten) due to construction and operation are low magnitude, and reversible in the long-term. Effects on wildlife abundance for trapped species (lynx, American marten) in hunting locations due to is low magnitude, negative Project contribution and, for American marten, reversible in the long -term and for the Canada lynx, reversible in the short term. Effects on wildlife mortality risk for trapped species (lynx, American marten) due to construction activities, vehicle collisions, and human -wildlife conflicts are low magnitude, frequency is occasional, and reversible in the short term. 2. Use or access to trapping locations and harvesting methods: Where Project construction and operations activities overlap with hunting and trapping locations, access to active mining areas may be limited until they are reclaimed and safe. Indigenous groups will continue to have access to hunting and trapping locations where safety is not compromised (Addendum 8, Append ix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CEAR #89). The Project's access restrictions within the mine permit area may also affect Indigenous groups' ability to use their preferr ed harvesting methods and seasonal rounds by altering the times of year that Indigenous grou ps have access to areas of interest for hunting/trapping within the mine permit area (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). Loss or disruption of traplines or trails used for trapping and loss of access to trapping locations due to the mi ne site and road closure during construction and operation. The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as moderate magnitude. Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of locations a nd the e xperience of hunting within the vicinity of the Project (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89); residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magni tude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42): The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Se ction 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectab le odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified trapped species and habitat, change use or access to identified trapping locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on trapping for Siksika Nation due reduction or loss of trapping opportunities and the change in trapping met hods could affect the cultural and spiritual relationship between the Nation and their territory, which is addressed below. Residual effects on trapping are characterized as: Magnitude is low because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to trap in the Project area, it will not affect the ability to trap in the RSA. The Siksika did not identify active trapping within the LSA (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 6.3.2.2, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyondlife of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency because loss of trapping opportunities will be continuous throughout construction and operation. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation is planned andexpected to re-establish natural processes and ecosystems that support trapped species and access will be restored following the AMP. Ecological and social context is sensitive because Siksika Nation have noted a decline in the number of species limited accessibility due to private land ownership, non-traditional land use activities, and community members avoidance due to concerns about contamination, safety and overall negative experiences on the land. These issues have placed trapping at moderate to high risk (Carlson et al. 2018; Addendum 10, JRP IR -4.6, Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 92 Table 6.7-4a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Siks ika Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Fishing 1. Fishing species and habitat: Westslope Cutthroat Trout (WSCT) The physical footprint of surface water management infrastructure and open pits will cause permanent change to WSCT habitat. The loss of riparian and aquatic habitat will be reversed by gains achieved through implementing an Offsetting Plan approved by DFO. The magnitude of this effect will be moderate, the duration is long, the frequency will be continuous, however, reversibility is characterized as reversible in the long - term (Addendum 1, CR#6, Section 4.5, CIAR #44). Changes in hydrology will cause alteration in WSCT aquatic habitat of Gold and Blairmore creeks. The alteration of habitat will be offset by gains achieved through implementing an Offsetting Plan approved by DFO. The magnitude of residual adverse effects will be moderate, the duration is extended, the frequency will be continuous, however, reversibility is characterized as reversible in the long -term (Addendum 1, CR#6, Section 4.5, CIAR #44). 2. Use or access to fishing locations and harvesting methods: Current access to the portions of the watercourses adjacent to Grassy Mountain is located on Benga private land. During construction and operation phases of the mine, this road will be closed to the general public, andalternate routes will need to be used to access and fish those portions of Blairmore and Gold Creeks (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.2.1.2, CIAR #89) which will be managed via the AMP. Loss or disruption of trails for accessing fishing locations due to the mine site and road closure during construction and operation. The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as moderate magnitude. Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitud e for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of fishing locations by Indigenous Nations and pref erred harvesting method. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1 CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as mo derate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to use or access to identified fishing locations, and change in preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on fishing for Siksika Nation due to reduction in fishing opportunities, engagement in fishing, and fishing success during construction and operation due to loss of access to fishing locations and sensory disturba nce within the mine permit area. Residual effects on fishing are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to fish for Siksika Nation as they have advised that they have fishing interests and identified species in the Project area (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 6.3.2.3, CIAR #251). However, this will not affect the ability to fish in the RSA. Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because access restrictions will apply beyond the life of the mine in some areas that may affect access to fishing locations. Continuous frequency because loss of fishing opportunities will be continuous throughout construction and operation. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation and offsetting isplanned and expected to maintain fish populations and access will be restoredfollowing the AMP. Ecological and social context is sensitive because Siksika Nation noted that past present activities have substantially reduced fishing opportunities in the area (Carlson et al. 2018; Addendum 10, JRP IR -4.6, CIAR #251). Plant Gathering 1. Plant species and habitat: The Project will result in loss of traditional use of vegetation within the vegetation local study area. Residual effects to TEK vegetation are local, long -term in duration, continuous, reversible and high magnitude. The Project will have a neutral contribution with respect to valued species and communities. After reclamation, the reclaimed land will support a range of communities with equivalent capabilities to those of th e surrounding lands and that existing prior to Project development. Residual adverse effects on vegetation were assessed as high magnitude for rare plants, community diversity, and TEK species, low magnitude for forest, and moderate for wetlands (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). Duration of effects on vegetation will be extended. Reclaimed land will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports traditional use plants (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.1, CIAR #42). Frequency of effects on vegetation, including rare plants and rare plant communities and traditional ecological knowledge, will be continuous through the operational phase of the project and cease only after reclamation is completed (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). Effects on vegetation are reversible in the long -term with the implementation of progressive reclamation (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). 2. Use or access to plant gathering locations and harvesting methods: Loss or disruption of trails, los s of access to plant gathering locations, and loss of and preferred methods for plant gathering due to the mine site and access road. Residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as moderate magnitude. Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dus t (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of plant gathering locations by Indigenous Nations and preferred harvesting method. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,5 00 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3 CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Tab le 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified plant gathering species and habitat, change use or access to identified harvesting locations, and change in preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on plant gathering for Siksika Nation due to reduction in harvesting opportunities, engagement in plant gathering, and harvesting success during construc tion and operation due to loss of access to plant gathering locations and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on plant gathering are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to gather plants for the Siksika Nation in the Project Area. The Siksika Nation have identified habitat and species for plant gathering in the Project LSA, including areasspecific for harvesting culturally important plants species. The Nation is concernedthat they may lose a source of yellow ochre which is critical to cerem 4.1-1, Section 6.3.2.4, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyondlife of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency due to continuous mine disturbance (loss of vegetation, accessrestrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation (of terrain, soil, vegetation) is planned and expected to re- establish natural processes and ecosystems that support traditional use plants (high density planting of disease-resistant whitebark pine seedlings will contribute to the successful re- establishment of the native ecosystem); and, access to plant gathering locations will be re-establishedafter mine closure. Ecological and social context is sensitive because engagement in plant gathering is sensitive to disruption and past and present activities have resulted in traditional land use at high risk (Carlson et al. 2018; Addendum 10, JRP IR -4.6, Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 93 Table 6.7-4a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Siks ika Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Trails and Travelways 1. Use of or access to trails and travelways: Loss or disruption of trails and travelways due to the mine site and access road. The Project will have residual adverse effects on use of trails and travelways because the Project could result in loss of trails and travelways that are fully or partially within the mine p ermit boundary. The Project footprint will be reclaimed to land use capability equivalent to pre- mining; however, it will not be accessible for use as trails and travelways during construction and operations. Access to areas around the Project will be possible using existing trails from Highway 40 to reach the area west of Blairmore Creek and Crown Land north of the Project and from either the north or the south along the Gold Creek. With th e implementation of the AMP, potential residual effects will be further reduced as Benga will be providing access to adjacent privately owned Benga lands for traditional practices (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 6.3.3.5, CIAR #251). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of trails and travelways by Indigenous Nations. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). 2. Features associated with trails and travelways: Loss or disturbance to features associated with trails and travelways due to the mine site and access road. Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude after reclamation (EIA, CR#10, CIAR#42). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to within the zone of influence (generally 1.5 km) for noise, visual disturbance, and effect on access (EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). The geographic extent of residual effects on historical resources and on land and resource use is characterized as local ( EIA, CR#10, Section E, CIAR #42). The frequency of impact on access and utilities in the lands and resource use is continuous (EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). The frequency of impact of noise and other disturbances to trail use will continue throughout the Project lifespan ( EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access and change preferred trails and travelways. There will be residual effects on trails and travelways for Siksika Nation due to restriction in use or access, and engagement with features associated with trails and travelways during construction and operation due to loss of or access to trails and travelways locations, sensory disturbance, and change in use within the mine permit area. Residual effects on trails and travelways is characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to use or access trails and travelways for Siksika Nation as they are fully or partially withinthe mine permit bo undary. However, it will not affect the ability to use trails and travelways in the RSA (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 6.3.2.5, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyondlife of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency during due to continuous mine disturbance (loss o f vegetation, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Non- reversible where trails and travelways are lost because when a trail is inaccessible it will not be maintained or used, resulting in the potential loss of the know ledge of or loss of the physical trail or travelway. Ecological and social context is resilient because the Siksika Nation can use alternative routes to travel between cultural and spiritual sites and resources within their traditional territory (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 6.3.1.5, CIAR #251). Therefore, Siksika Nation use and access to trails and travelways is not sensitive to disruption from the Project. Cultural and Spiritual Values 1. Use and access to sacred important sites with cultural or spiritual value: Residual adverse effects on access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42). Loss or disruption of trails to important sites due to the mine site and access road. Loss o f hunting, trapping, fis hing, and plant gathering opportunities. The residual effects, as seen above, on hunting, trapping and plant gathering were assessed as moderate magnitude. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and op eration, which could affect use and enjoyment of culturally and spiritually important sites. Increased noise levels extend 1.5 km from the Project (EIA, CR#2, CIAR#42). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). 2. Experience of engaging with sites of cultural or spiritual value: Loss or disturbance to important sites due to the mine site and access road. Loss of experience in hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering, which could affect the cultural and spiritual relationships with the resource. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation, which could affect enjoyment or experience of using culturally and spiritually important sites. 3. Cultural values associated with sites/features Loss of hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering opport unities, which could affect intergenerational teaching of traditional practices, and result in loss of cultural identity, sense of place, and human health/well- being. Loss of access to sites/features due to construction and operation activities. Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features as a result of clearing and construction activities. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation, which could affect enjoyment or experience of engaging with the sites/features of cultural or spiritual value. In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to sites with cultural or spiritual value, change the experience of using these sites, and change the cultural value associated with sites and features. There will be residual effects on cultural and spiritual values for Siksika Nation during construction and operation due to loss of access to culturally or spiritually important sites and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effect on cultural and spiritual values is characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the values adexperience associated with cultural or spiritual sites for the Siksika Nation through direct disturbance and change in noise and air quality (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1- 1, Section 5.3.2.6, CIAR #251). However, this will not affect the ability to use or access sites associated with cultural and spiritual values in the RSA. The Siksika Nation has expressed concern for continuing loss of cultural and spiritual values not only through hunting, trapping, fishing and plant gathering, but also through changesto the landscape and sacred and ceremonial sites. It is expected that the visual and sensory experience of visiting these locations will also change (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 6.3.2.6, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because the loss of experience in hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering could affect the long -term cultural and spiritual relationships between Indigenous groups and their resources and territory. Change in land useand access will extend beyond the Project lifespan. Continuous frequency during due to continuous mine disturbance (loss of vegetation, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Non- reversible because loss of cultural and spiritual sites and experience in engaging in land use could result in loss of the knowledge of cultural and spiritual values. Ecological and social context is sensitive because loss of engagement in land use affects cultural identity, human well- being and relationships, and intergenerational transfer of knowledge.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 94 Table 6.7-4a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Siks ika Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Physical and Cultural Heritage 1.Physical and cultural heritage: Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage as a result of clearing and construction activities. The geographic extent of residual effects on historical resources is local (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). 2.Access to physical and cultural he ritage: Loss or disruption of trails to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage due to the mine site and access road. The magnitude of effects on trails and travelways was characterized as moderate. 3.Cultural value and importance associated with physical and cultural heritage: Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could result in reduced engagement with the sites/features of cultural value. Magnitude was assessed as high for TEK plant species (EIA, CR#8, CIAR #42) whereas magnitude is low to moderate for hunted and trapped wildlife (EIA, CR#9, CEAR #42). Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage as a result of clearing and construction activities. The magnitude of effects on cultural and spiritual values was characterized as moderate. 4.Relationship with physical and cultural heritage: Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42) and access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42), but for those VCs that affect the relationships with physical and cultural heritage ( e.g., air quality, noise, plant gathering, h unting and trapping), magnitude is assessed as high for odour and low to moderate for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1 CIAR #42), and moderate for hunting, trapping and plant gathering. Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage as a result of clearing and construction activities could result in loss of relationship with heritage. Loss of hunting, tra pping, fishing, and plant gathering opportunities due to construction and operation and access restrictions could result in loss of relationship with wildlife and cultural practices. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could result in reduced engagement with the sites/features associated with physical or cultural heritage. In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to physical and cultural heritage, change the value and importance and the relationship the Siksika Nation have with these sites. There will be residual effects on Indigenous physical and cultural heritage for Siksika Nation during construction and operation due to loss of access and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on Indigenous physical and cultural heritage are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the access to and value of physical and cultural heritage for the Siksika Nation in the Project area. The Siksika Nation have identified cultural and spiritual sites on Grassy Mountain (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 6.3.2.6, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because disturbance to or loss of unique sites and features will extend beyond the Project lifespan. Regular frequency because disturbance to unique sites and features will occur duringconstruction and operation activities whenever sites or features are discovered. Non- reversible because loss of heritage sites and features and experience in engaging in heritage sites could result in loss of the knowledge of cultural heritage. Ecological and social context is sensitive because loss of heritage sites and featuresor loss of engagement with physical and cultural heritage could affect cult ural identity, human well- being, and intergenerational transfer of knowledge.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 95 In summary, the residual effects characterization has not ch anged greatly from that already provided. The only change from the previous effects characterization is that the magnitude for trapping has been corrected from moderate to low for the reasons explained above. As such, the summary Table 6.4.4- 1 from An Up dated Assessment of the Potential Effects of the Grassy Mountain Project on Indigenous Groups (Appendix 4.1-1, Addendum 10, CIAR#251) is provided below as Table 6.7-4b, with this one correction.

A summary table of this characterization was provided as Table 7.4.4-1 (Appendix 4.1-1: An Updated Assessment of the Potential Effects of the Grassy Mountain Project on Indigenous Groups , Addendum 10, CIAR#251), and is copied below for the convenience of the reader as Table 6.7-5b. Table 6.7-5a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional P urposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Stoney Nakoda Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Hunting 1. Hunted species and habitat: The Project will have temporary effects on land access for traditional resource use and on the distribution and abundance of species hunted for traditional purposes. Species preferring recently disturbed and young habitats are expected to return first, followed by species preferring increasingly older habitat types with reclamation. Moose and Elk: Suitable moose and elk habitat will decline initially but is predicted to be more abundant than baseline levels by end of mine due, in part, to reclamation of legacy mine sites that overlap the Project footprint (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.6.2.1, CIAR #42). The changes in abundance of moose and elk year -round in the WLSA are expected to follow a similar pattern as individuals of both species will be displaced into adjacent habitats. Grizzly Bear: Highly suitable grizzly bear habitat in the WLSA will decrease initially during the construction and operation phases and then increase throughout the duration of progressive reclamation. Mortality risk also increases with Project development but then decreases with progressive reclamation. With reclamation, the Project footprint is expected to offer more suitable habitat (dietary resources) and lower mortality risk than under baseline conditions, which are anticipated to allo w for an i ncrease in the size of the grizzly bear population that the local area can support. Wildlife Residual Effects (EIA, CR#9, Table 5.3-26, CIAR #42): Effects on habitat availability for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) due to vegetation clearing and s ensory disturbance (due to increased noise, odour, visual disturbance) are low magnitude, positive Project contribution, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife movement for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) due to construction and ope ration are low magnitude, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife abundance for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) in hunting location is low magnitude, positive Project contribution for elk and grizzly bear, neutral Project contribution for moose, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife mortality risk for hunted species due to construction activities, vehicle collisions, and human -wildlife conflicts are low magnitude, frequency is occasional, and reversible in the long -term. With the Access Control Policy and firearm prohibition by Project personnel, poaching and non -Indigenous hunting of moose, elk, and grizzly bear will decline in the WLSA during the life of mine and may result in increased abundance of moose, elk, and grizzly bear in the areas accessible by Indigenous groups (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.6.2.1, CIAR #42). A screening level wildlife risk assessment was conducted, the results of which indicate that there is no potential risk of adverse effects associated with Project emissions on the health of wildlife in the study areas(Addendum 10, Appendix 4.9-1, Section 8.0, Updated Human Health and Wildlife Screening Risk Assessment, CIAR #251). The wildlife risk assessment was amended to include an evaluation of water -based exposure pathways (both groundwater and surface water) and the results presented for Blairmore Creek, Gold Creek and the Oldman Reservoir were not considered to be indicative of adverse effects (Addendum 11, JRP IR -6.28). For the proposed end pit lake (EPL) (at closure), the results of the risk assessment are not considered indicative of a human health concern; however, management considerations of the EPL are warranted and actual measured concentrations at the time of EPL creation should be used to revisit predicted effects (Addendum 11, JRP IR -6.27). The assessment includes an Indigenous-specific conceptual model, which describes sourcepathway linkages between the Project and Indigenous use of all aquatic pathways including the end pit lake, Blairmore and Gold Creeks, the Crowsnest River and the Oldman Reservoir in the post closure landscape. 2. Use or access to hunting locations and harvesting methods: Where Project construction and operations activities overlap with hunting locations, access to active mining areas may be limited until they are reclaimed and safe. Indigenous groups will continue to have access to huntingand trapping locations where safety is not compromised (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). The Project's access restrictions within the mine permit area may also affect Indigenous groups' ability to use their preferred harvesting methods and seasonal rounds by altering the times of year that Indigenous groups have access to areas of interest for hunting within the mine permit area (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as moderate magnitude. Increased noise, odou r, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of loc ations and the experience of hunting within the vicinity of the Project (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89); residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42): The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Secti on 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). Where Indigenous groups utilize firearms for hunting, the Project's firearms restriction policy would affect their ability to use that harvesting method within the mine footprint. Alternate hunting methods may be possible in parts of the mine footprint that have not yet been disturbed or which have been reclaimed under the AMP (Addendu m 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.3, CIAR #89). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified hunted species and habitat, change use or access to identified hunting locations, and change in preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on hunting for Stoney Nakoda Nation due to reduction in hunting opportunities, engagement in hunting, and hunting success during construction and operation due to loss of access of hunting locations, sensory disturbance, and change in wildlife use within the mine permit area. Residual effects on hunting are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the ability tohunt for the Stoney Nakoda Nation in the area but this does not change the ability tohunt in the RSA. Although no specific hunting sites were identified, the StoneyNakoda Nation continues to hunt throughout their traditional territory for species found in the Project area. The Project activities will intersect or be in proximity to habitat and species that are identif ied for hunting by the Stoney Appendix 4.1-1, Section 7.3.2.1, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyondlife of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency because loss of hunting opportunit ies will be continuous throughout construction and operation. Reversible because reclamation is planned and expected to re- establish natural processes and ecosystems that support hunted species and access will be restored following the AMP. Ecological and social context is sensitive because engagement in hunting is sensiti ve to disruption and hunting is important to the Stoney Nakoda Nation for cultural and spiritual relationship between members and wildlife (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 7.3.2.1, CIAR#251). Stoney Nakoda Nation continue to hunt throughout their traditional territory for subsistence, medicinal, and ceremonial purposes for species for which habitats will be affected by the Project through loss of habitat and avoidance of area ( e.g., elk, moose, MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 97 Table 6.7-5a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional P urposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Stoney Nakoda Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Trapping The Stoney Nakoda Nation Consultation Team has not identified an interest in trapping in the Project area. It is not anticipated that the Project will have adverse effects to trapping activities for the Stoney Nakoda Nation, however, if they do trap, the mitigations above in the hunting section will apply (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 7.3.2.2, CIAR #251). There is no residual effect to trapping. Fishing 1.Fishin g species and habitat: Westslope Cutthroat Trout (WSCT) The physical footprint of surface water management infrastructure and open pits will cause permanent change to WSCT habitat. The loss of riparian and aquatic habitat will be reversed by gains achieved through implementing an Offsetting Plan approved by DFO. The magnitude of this effect will be moderate, the duration is long, the frequency will be continuous, however, reversibility is characterized as reversible in the long- term. (Addendum 1, CR#6, Se ction 4.5, CIAR #44). Changes in hydrology will cause alteration in WSCT aquatic habitat of Gold and Blairmore creeks. The alteration of habitat will be offset by gains achieved thr ough implementing an Offsetting Plan approved by DFO. The magnitude of residual adverse effects will be moderate, the duration is extended, the frequency will be continuous, however, reversibility is characterized as reversible in the long -term. (Addendum 1, CR#6, Section 4.5, CIAR #44). 2.Use or access to fishing locations and harvesting methods: Current access to the portions of the watercourses adjacent to Grassy Mountain is located on Benga private land. During construction and operation phases of the mine, this road will be closed to the general public, andalternate routes will need to be used to access and fish those portions of Blairmore and Gold Creeks (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.2.1.2, CIAR #89) which will be managed via the AMP. Loss or disruption of trails for accessing fishing locations due to the mine site and road closure during construction and operation. The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as moderate magnitude (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Table 7.4.4 -1, CIAR #251). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of fishing locations by Indigenous Nations and preferred harvesting method. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to identified fishing locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on fishing for Stoney Nakoda Nation due to reduction in fishing opportunities, engagement in fishing, and fishing success during construction and operation due to los s of access of fishing locations and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on fishing are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to fish for Stoney Nakoda Nation as they have fishing interests and identified species in the Project area (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 7.3.2.3, CIAR #251) and Project effects on Westslope cutthroat trout was assessed as moderate magnitude. This will not affect the ability to fish in the RSA. Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because access restrictions will apply beyond the life of the mine in some areas that may affect access to fishing locations. Continuous frequency because loss of fishing opportunities will be continuousthroughout construction and operation. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation and offsetting isplanned and expected to maintain the fish population and access will be restored following the AMP. Ecological and social context is resilient because the Stoney Nakoda Nation engage in fishing primarily outside the Project LSA in the Crowsnest River watershed andOld Man River watershed north of the LSA . Plant Gathering 1.Plant species and habitat: The Project will result in loss of traditional use of vegetation within the vegetation local study area. Residual effects to TEK vegetation are local, long -term in duration, continuous, reversible and high magnitude. The Project will have a neutral contribution with respect to valued species and communities. After reclamation, the reclaimed land will support a range of communities with equivalent capabilities to those of the surroundinglands and that existing pri or to Project development. Residual adverse effects on vegetation were assessed as high magnitude for rare plants, community diversity, and TEK species, low magnitude for forest, and moderate for wetlands (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). Duratio n of effects on vegetation will be extended. Reclaimed land will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports traditional use plants (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.1, CIAR #42). Frequency of effects on vegetation, including rare plants and rare plant communities and traditional ecological knowledge, will be continuous through the operational phase of the project and cease only after reclamation is completed (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). Effects on vegetation are reversible in the lon g-term with the implementation of progressive reclamation (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). 2.Use or access to plant gathering locations and harvesting methods: Loss or disruption of trails, loss of access to plant gathering locations, and loss of and preferred methods for plant gathering due to the mine site and access road. Residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed asmoderate magnitude. Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting , and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of plant gathering locations by Indigenous Nations and preferred harvestin g method. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used b y Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is pre dicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odour s from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3 CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified plant gathering species and habitat, change use or access to identified harvesting locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on plant gathering for Stoney Nakoda Nation due to reduction in harvesting opportunities, engagement in plant gathering, and harvesting success during construction and operation due to loss of access to plant gathering locations and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on plant gathering are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to gather plants for the Stoney Nakoda Nation in the Project area. The Stoney Nakoda Nation have identified habitat and species for plant gathering in the proximity of the Project (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 7.3.2.4, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyondlife of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency due to continuous mine disturbance (loss of vegetation, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation (of terrain, soil, vegetation) is planned and expected to re- establish natural processes and ecosystems that support traditional use plants (high density planting of disease-resistant whitebark pine seedlings will contribute to the successful re-establishm ent of the native ecosystem); and, access to plant gathering locations will be re-established after mine closure. Ecological and social context is sensitive because engagement in plant gathering is sensitive to disruption and past and present activities have resulted in traditional land use at high risk. The Stoney Nakoda Nation have noted that in and around the Project area, there are plant species central to ceremony, healing practices, and spirituality (Addendum 10, JRP IR -4.6, CIAR #251).

The Project will have residual adverse effects on use of trails and travelways because the Project could result in loss of trails and travelways that are fully or partially within the mine permit boundary. The Project footprint will be reclaimed to land use capability equivalent to pre- mining; however, it will not be accessible for use as trails and travelways during construction and operations. Access to areas around the Project will be possible using existing trails from Highway 40 to reach the area west of Blairmore Creek and Crown Land north of the Project and from either the north or the south along the Gold Creek. With the implementation of the AMP, potential residual effects will be further reduced as Benga will be providing access to adjacent privately owned Benga lands for traditional practices (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 7.3.3.5, CIAR #251). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting , and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and opera tion could affect use of trails and travelways by Indigenous Nations. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours fr om NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). 2.Features associated with trails and travelways: Loss or disturbance to f eatures associated with trails and travelways due to the mine site and access road. Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude after reclamation (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to within the zone of influence (generally 1.5 km) for noise, visual disturbance, and effect on access ( EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). The geographic extent of residual effects on historical resources and on land and resource use is characterized as local ( EIA, CR#10, Section E, CIAR #42). The frequency of impact on access and utilities in the lands and resource use is continuous ( EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). The frequency of impact of noise and ot her disturbances to trail use will continue throughout the Project lifespan ( EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access and change preferred trails and travelways. There will be residual effects on trails and travelways for Stoney Nakoda Nation due to restriction in use or access, and engagement with features associates with trails and travelways during construction and operation due to loss of access to trails and travelways locations, sensory disturbance, and change in use within the mine permit area. Residual effects on trails and travelwa ys is characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to use or access trails and travelways for The Stoney Nakoda Nation. The Nation did not disclose in exact detail of how the Project area was used, however, following aerial surveillance of the area, the Nation pointed out the possibility of \"trails according to geomorphology, elevation, and landscape features \" (Stoney Nakoda Nation, 2015, p.19). Although it is possible that the Project may intersect or b e in proximity to areas that are identified for trails and travelways by Stoney Nakoda, none were identified (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 7.3.2.5, CIAR#251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but are limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyondlife of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency during operations and construction due to continuous minedisturbance (loss of vegetation, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Non- reversible where trails and travelways are lost because when a trail is inaccessible it will not be maintained or used, resulting in the potential loss of the knowledge of or loss of the physical trail or travelway. Ecological and social context is resilient because Stoney Nakoda Nation did notidentify trails and travelways in the Project area but outside. Although it is possible that the Project may intersect or be in proximity to areas that are identified for trails and travelways by Stoney Nakoda Nation, none 4.1-1, Section 7.3.2.5, CIAR #251) and they can use alternative routes to travel between cultural and spiritual sites and resources within their traditional territory. Therefore, Stoney Nakoda Nation use and access to trails and travelwaysis not sensitive to disruption from the Project. Cultural and Spiritual Values 1.Use and access to sacred important sites with cultural or spiritual value: Residual adverse effects on access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42). Loss or disruption of tra ils to important sites due to the mine site and access road. Loss of hunting, fishing, and plant gathering opportunities. The residual effects, as seen above, on hunting and plant gathering were assessed as moderate magnitude, and there is no residual eff ect on trapping. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation, which could affect use and enjoyment of culturally and spiritually important sites. Increased noise levels extend 1.5 km from the Project (EIA, CR#2, CIAR#42). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). 2.Experience of engaging with sites of cultural or spiritual value: Loss or disturbance to important sites due to the mine site and access road. Loss of experience in hunting, fishing, and plant gathering, which could affect the cultural and spiritual relationships with the resource. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation, which could affect enjoyment or experience of using culturally and spiritually important sites. 3. Cultural values associated with sites/features: Loss of hunting, fishing, and plant gathering opportunities, which could affect intergenerational teaching of traditional practices, and result in loss of cultural identity, sense of place, and human health/well- being. Loss of access to sites/features due to construction and operation activities. Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features as a result of clearing and construction activities. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during c onstruction and operation, which could affect enjoyment or experience of engaging with the sites/features of cultural or spiritual value. In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to sites with cultural or spiritual value, change the experience of using these sites, and change the cultural value associated with sites and features. There will be residual effects on cultural and spiritual values for Stoney Nakoda Nation during construction and operation due to loss of access to culturally or spiritually important sites and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effect on cultural and spiritual values is characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the values ad experience associated with cultural or spiritual sites for the Stoney Nakoda Nationthrough direct disturbance and change in noise and air quality. It was noted that the Project may intersect or be in proximity to areas that are identified for cultural and spiritual values for the Stoney Nakoda Nation (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 7.3.2.6, CIAR #251). In addition to a direct change to cultural and spiritual values and associated features, it is expected that the visual and sensory experience of visiting these locations will also change. The Project will cause a certain change in noise, dust and a visual disturbance (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 7.3.2.6, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because the loss of experience in hunting, fishing, and plant gathering could affect the long -term cultural and spiritual relationships between Indigenous groups and their resources and territory. Change in land use and access will extend beyond the Project lifespan. Continuous frequency during due to continuous mine disturbance (loss of vegetation, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Non- reversible because loss of cultural and spiritual sites and experience in engaging in land use could result in loss of the knowledge of cultural and spiritual values. Ecological and social context is sensitive because loss of heritage sites and features or loss of engagement with physical and cultural heritage affects cultural identity, human well- being and relationships, and intergenerational transfer of knowledge. The Stoney Nakoda have stated that the Project will \"continue the diminution of our traditional culture by irreversibly destroying our spiritual and ceremonial use sites on the Mountain from which we worship at Crowsnest Mountain. Traditional Blackfoot spirituality is the fabric that binds our culture and people together.\" (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 7.3.2.4, LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 99 Table 6.7-5a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional P urposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Stoney Nakoda Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Physical and Cultural Heritage 1.Physical and cultural heritage: Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage as a result of clearing and construction activities. The geographic extent of residual effects on historical resources is local (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). 2.Access to physical and cultural heritage: Loss or disruption of trails to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage due to the mine site and access road. The magnitude of effects on trails and travelways was characterized as moderate. 3.Cultural value and importance associated with physical and cultural heritage: Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could result in reduced engagement with the sites/features of cultural value. Magnitude was assessed as high for TEK plant species (EIA, CR#8, CIAR #42), whereas magnitude is low to moderate for hunted and trapped wildlife (EIA, CR#9, CIAR #42). Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage as a result of clearing and construction activities. The magnitude of effects on cultural and spiritual values was characterized as moderate. 4.Relationship with physical and cultural heritage: Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42) and access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42), but for those VCs that affect the relationships with physical and cultural heritage ( e.g., air quality, noise, plant gathering, hunting and ), magnitude is assessed as high for odour and low to moderate for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1 CIAR #42), and moderate for hunting and plant gathering. Loss o f or damage to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage as a result of clearing and construction activities could result in loss of relationship with heritage. Loss of hunting, fishing, and plant gathering opportuniti es due to construction and operation and access restrictions could result in loss of relationship with wildlife and cultural practices. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could result in reduced engagement wi th the sites/features associated with physical or cultural heritage. In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to physical and cultural heritage, change the value and importance, and change the relationship the Stoney Nakoda Nation have with these sites. There will be residual effects on Indigenous physical and cultural heritage for Stoney Nakoda Nation during construction and operation due to loss of access and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on Indigenous Physical and cultural heritage are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the acces s to and value of physical and cultural heritage for the Stoney Nakoda Nation. While the Stoney Nakoda Nation Site Summary does not provide exact locations of sacredplaces within the Project area, it mentions that there are areas on the mountain that are recognized by the Stoney Nakoda Members as meditation sites (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 7.3.1.6, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because disturbance to or loss of unique sites and features will extend beyond the Project lifespan. Regular frequency because disturbance to unique sites and features will occ ur during construction and operation activities whenever sites or features are discove red. Non- reversible because loss of heritage sites and features and experience in engaging in land use could result in loss of the knowledge of cultural heritage. Ecologi cal and social context is sensitive because loss of heritage sites and features or los s of engagement with physical and cultural heritage could affect cultural identity, human well- being, and intergenerational transfer of knowledge.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 100 In summary, the residual effects characterization has not changed greatly from that already provided. The only change from the previous effects characterization is that the ecological and social context for fishing has been corrected from sensitive to resilient for the reasons explained above. As such, the summary Table 7.4.4- 1 from An Updated Assessment of the Potential Effects of the Grassy Mountain Project on Indigenous Groups (Appendix 4.1- 1, Addendum 10, CIAR#251) is provided below as Table 6.7-5b, with this one correction.

A summary table of this characterization was provided as Table 8.4.4-1 (Appendix 4.1-1: An Updated Assessment of the Potential Effects of the Grassy Mountain Project on Indigenous Groups , Addendum 10, CIAR#251), and is copied below for the convenience of the reader as Table 6.7-6b. Table 6.7-6a Description and characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cul tural Heritage for the Tsuut'ina Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Hunting 1. Hunted species and habitat: The Project will have temporary effects on land access for traditional resource use and on the distribution and abundance of species hunted for traditional purposes. Species preferring recently disturbed and young habitats are expected to return first, followed by species preferring increasingly older habitat types with reclamation. Moose and Elk: Suitable moose and elk habitat will decline initially but is predicted to be more abundant than baseline levels by end of mine due, in part, to reclamation of legacy mine sites that overlap the Project footprint ( EIA, CR#9, Section 5.6.2.1, CIAR #42). The changes in abundance of moose and elk year -round in the WLSA are expected to follow a similar pattern as individuals of both species will be displaced into adjacent habitats. Grizzly Bear: Highly suitable grizzly bear habitat in the WLSA will decrease initially during the construction and operation phases and then increase throughout the duration of progressive reclamation. Mortality risk also increases with Project development but then decreases with progressive reclamation. With reclamation, the Project footprint is expected to offer more suitable habitat (dietary resources) and lower mortality risk than under baseline conditions, which are anticipated to allow for an increase in the size of the grizzly bear population that the local area can support. Wildlife Residual Effects (EIA, CR#9, Table 5.3-26, CIAR #42): Effects on habitat availability for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) due to vegetation clearing and sensory disturbance (due to increased noise, odour, visual disturbance) are low magnitude, positive Project contribution, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife movement for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) due to construction and operation are low magnitude, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife abundance for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) in hunting location is low magnitude, positive Project contribution for elk and grizzly bear, neutral Project contribution for moose, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife mortality risk for hunted species due to construction activities, vehicle collisions, and human -wildlife conflicts are low magnitude, frequency is occasional, and reversible in the long -term. With the Access Control Policy and firearm prohibition by Project personnel, poaching and non- Indigenous hunting of moose, elk, and grizzly bear will decline in the WLSA during the life of mine and may result in increased abundance of moose, elk, and grizzly bear in the areas accessible by Indigenous groups (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.6.2.1, CIAR #42). A screening level wildlife risk assessment was conducted, the results of which indicate that there is no potential risk of adverse effects associated with Project emissions on the health of wildlife in the study areas(Addendum 10, Appendix 4.9-1, Section 8.0, Updated Human Health and Wildlife Screening Risk Assessment, CIAR #251) . The wildlife risk assessment was amended to include an evaluation of water -based exposure pathways (both groundwater and surfa ce water) and the results presented for Blairmore Creek, Gold Creek and the Oldman Reservoir were not considered to be indicative of adverse effects (Addendum 11, JRP IR -6.28). For the proposed end pit lake (EPL) (at closure), the results of the risk assessment are not considered indicative of a human health concern; however, management considerations of the EPL are warranted and actual measured concentrations at the time of EPL creation should be used to revisit predicted effects (Addendum 11, JRP IR -6.27) . The assessment includes an Indigenous- specific conceptual model, which describes sourcepathway linkages between the Project and Indigenous use of all aquatic pathways includin g the end pit lake, Blairmore and Gold Creeks, the Crowsnest River and the Oldman Reservoir in the post closure landscape. 2. Use or access to hunting locations and harvesting methods: Where Project construction and operations activities overlap with hunting locations, access to active mining areas may be limited until they are reclaimed and safe. Indigenous groups will continue to have access to huntingand trapping locations where safety is not compromised (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). The Project's access restrictions within the mine permit area may also affect Indigenous groups' ability to use their pre ferred harvesting methods and seasonal rounds by altering the times of year that Indigenous groups have access to areas of interest for hunting within the mine permit area (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as moderate magnitude Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of locations and the experi ence of hunting within the vicinity of the Project (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89); residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42): The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). Where Indigenous groups utilize firearms for hunting, the Project's firearms restriction policy would affect their ability to use that harvesting method within the mine footprint. Alternate hunting methods may be possible in parts of the mine footprint that have not yet been disturbed or which have been reclaimed under the AMP (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.3, CIAR #89). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified hunted species and habitat, change use or access to identified hunting locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on hunting for Tsuut'ina Nation due to reduction in hunting opportunities, engagement in hunting, and hunting success during construction and operation due to loss of access to hunting locations, sensory disturbance, and change in wildlife use within the mine permit area. Residual effects on hunting are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to hunt for the Tsuut'ina Nation in the area but this does not change the ability tohunt in the RSA. Although the Tsuut'ina Nation do not hunt as extensively ascompared to pa st levels of hunting, they still use the Crowsnest Pass area for hunting (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 8.3.1.1, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will applybeyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency because loss of hunting opportunities will be continuousthroughout construction and operation. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation is planned andexpected to re- establish natural processes and ecosystems that support hunted species and access will be restored following the AMP. Ecological and social context is resilient because the Tsuut'ina Nation do not hunt as extensively as compared to past levels of hunting, they still use the Crowsnest Pass area for hunting (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 8.3.1.1, CIAR #251). This is outside the Project LSA. Tsuut'ina Nation did not identify hunting areas in the Project area. Tsuut'ina Nation engagement in hunting isconsidered not sensitive to disruption from the Project. Trapping The Tsuut'ina Nation Consultation Team did not provide information about current trapping practices. Based on information provided by the Tsuut'ina Nation, there are no traplines currently in use within the LSA (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 8.3.1.2, CIAR #251). There is no predicted residual effect on trapping. There is no residual effect on trapping. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 102 Table 6.7-6a Description and characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cul tural Heritage for the Tsuut'ina Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Fishing 1.Fishing species and habitat: Westslope Cutthroat Trout (WSCT) The physical footprint of surface water management infrastructure and open pits will cause permanent change to WSCT habitat. The loss of riparian and aquatic habitat will be reversed by gains achieved through implementing an Offsetting Plan approved by DFO. The magnitude of this effect will be moderate, the duration is long, the frequency will be contin uous, however, reversibility is characterized as reversible in the long- term. (Addendum 1, CR#6, Section 4.5, CIAR #44). Changes in hydrology will cause alteration in WSCT aquatic habitat of Gold and Blairmore creeks. The alteration of habitat will be offset by gains achieved through implementing an Offsetting Plan approved by DFO. The magnitude of residual adverse effects will be moderate, the duration is extended, the frequency will be continuous, however, reversibility is characterized as reversible in the long -term. (Addendum 1, CR#6, Section 4.5, CIAR #44). 2.Use or access to fishing locations and harvesting methods: Current access to the portions of the watercourses adjacent to Grassy Mountain is located on Benga private land. During cons truction and operation phases of t he mine, this road will be closed to the general public, and alternate routes will need to be used to access and fish those portions of Blairmore and Gold Creeks (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.2.1.2, CIAR #89) which will be managed via the AMP. Loss or disruption of trails for accessing fishing locations due to the mine site and road closure during construction and operation. The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as moderate magnitude. Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of fish ing locations by Indigenous Nations and preferred harvesting method. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1 CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, S ection 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to identified fishing locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on fishing for Tsuut'ina Nation due to reduction in fishing opportunities, engagement in fishing, and fishing success during construction and ope ration due to loss of access to fishing locations and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on fishing are characterized as: Magnitude is low because the Tsuut'ina Nation has not identified an interest in fishing in the Project area. Thus, it is anticipated that the Project would not affectfishing activities, resources or access for the Tsuut'ina Nation (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 8.3.2.3, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because access restrictions will apply beyond the life of the mine in some areas that may affect access to fishing locations. Continuous frequency because loss of fishing opportunities will be c ontinuous throughout construction and operation. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation and offsetting isplanned and expected to maintain fish populations and access will be restored following the AMP. Ecological and social context is resilient because Tsuut'ina Nation did not identify an interest in fishing in the Project area. Thus, it is anticipated that the Project would not affect fishing activities, resources or access for the Tsuut'ina Nation(Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 8.3.2.3, CIAR #251). Tsuu'tina Nation identified fishing outside the Project area, e.g., Bow River, Bragg Creek and Fish Creek during the summer. Tsuut'ina Nation engagement in fishing is considerednot sensitive to disruption from the Project. Plant Gathering 1.Plant species and habitat: The Project will result in loss of traditional use of vegetation within the vegetation local study area. Residual effects to TEK vegetation are local, long -term in duration, continuous, reversible and high magnitude. The Project will have a neutral contribution with respect to valued species and communities. After reclamation, the reclaimed land will support a range of communities with equivalent capabilities to those of the surrounding lands and that existing prior to Project develop ment. Residual adverse effects on vegetation were assessed as high magnitude for rare plants, community diversity, and TEK species, low magnitude for forest, and moderate for wetlands (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). Duration of effects on vegetation will be extended. Reclaimed land will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports traditional use plants (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.1, CIAR #42). Frequency of effects on vegetation, including rare plants and rare plant communities and traditional ecological knowledge, will be continuous through the operational phase of the project and cease only after reclamation is completed (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). Effects on vegetation are reversible in the long -term with the implementation of progressive reclamation (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). 2.Use or access to plant gathering locations and harvesting methods: Loss or disruption of trails, loss of access to plant gathering locations, and loss of and preferred methods for plant gathering due to the mine site and access road. Residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed asmoderate magnitude. Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of plant gathering locations by Indigenous Nations and preferred harvesting m ethod. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by I ndigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO2) is predic ted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3 CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified plant gathering species and habitat, change use or access to identified harvesting locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on plant gathering for Tsuut'ina Nation due to reduction in harvesting opportunities, engagement in plant gathering, and harvesting success during construction and operation due to loss of access to plant gathering locations and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on plant gathering are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the ability togather plants for Tsuut'ina Nation in the Project area. The Tsuut'ina Nation have identified habitat and species for plant gathering that are in the proximity of the Project (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 8.3.2.4, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but li mited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency due to continuous mi ne disturbance (loss of vegetation, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation (of terrain, soil, vegetation) is planned and expected to re- establish natural processes and ecosystems that support traditional use plants (high density planting of disease-resistant whitebark pine seedlings will contribute to the successful re - establishment of the native ecosystem); and, access to plant gathering locations will be re -established after mine closure. Ecological and social context is sensitive because Indigenous engagement in plant gathering is sensitive to disruption. Loss of use or access or change in gathering methods could affect the cultural and spiritual relationship between the Nationand their territory. This could result in loss of cultural identity and human health and well- being. Further, multiple alpine plants found at Grassy Mountain that are crucial to Tsuut'ina Nation ceremony, healing practices, cultural identity, a nd spirituality are not found at lower elevations near Tsuut'ina communities(Addendum 10, JRP IR -4.6, Table MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 103 Table 6.7-6a Description and characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cul tural Heritage for the Tsuut'ina Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Trails and Travelways 1.Use or access to trails and travelways: Loss or disruption of trails and travelways due to the mine site and access road. The Project will have residual adverse effects on use of trails and travelways because the Project could result in loss of trails and travelway s that are fully or partially within the mine permit boundary. The Project footprint will be reclaimed to land use capability equivalent to pre- mining; however, it will not be accessible for use as trails and travelways during construction and operations. Access to areas around the Project will be possible using existing trails from Highway 40 to reach the area west of Blairmore Creek and Crown Land north of the Project and from either the north or the south along the Gold Creek. With the implementation of the AMP, potential residual effects will be further reduced as Benga will be providing access to adjacent privately owned Benga lands for traditional practices (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 8.3.3.5, CIAR #251). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magn itude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of trails and travelways by Indigenous Nations. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). 3. Features associated with trails and travelways: Loss or disturbance to features associated with trails and travelways due to the mine site and access road. Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude after reclamation (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to within the zone of influence (generally 1.5 km) for noise, visual disturbance, and effect on access (EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). The geographic extent of residual effects on historical resources and on land and resource use is characterized as local (EIA, CR#10, Section E, CIAR #42). The frequency of impact on access and utilities in the lands and resource use is continuous (EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). The frequency of impact of noise and other disturbances to trail use will continue throughout the Project lifespan (EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access and change preferred trails and travelways. There will be residual effects on trails and travelways for Tsuut'ina Nation due to restriction in use or access, and engagement with features associated with trails and travelways during construction and operation due to loss of access to trails and travelways locations, sensory disturbance, and change in use within the mine permit area. Residual effects on trails and travelways are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to use or access trails and travelways in and around the Project area. Tsuut'ina oral history describes where they travelled, including in proximity of the Project. Travel and access to the Crowsnest Pass by the Tsuut'ina Nation members has diminished since contact with Euro -Canadian settlers. While the Nation continues to use hunting t rails throughout the Grassy Mountain area, this is done less than in the past. No site -specific details were provided to Benga. (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 8.3.1.5, CIAR#251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency during construction and operation due to continuous mine disturbance (loss of vegetation, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Non- reversible where trails and travelways are lost because when a trail is inaccessible it will not be maintained or used, resulting in the potential loss of the knowledge of or loss of the physical trail or travelway. Ecological and social context is resilient because Tsuut'ina Nation did not identify trails and travelways in the Project area but outside the LSA. Tsuut'ina Nation can use alternative routes to travel between cultural and spiritual sites and resources within their traditional territory. Therefore, Tsuut'ina Nation use and access to trails and travelways is not sensitive to disruption from the Project. Cultural and Spiritual Values 1.Use and access to sacred important sites with cultural or spiritual value: Residual adverse effects on access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42). Loss or disruption of trails to important sites due to the mine site and access road. Loss of hunting, fishing, and plant gathering opportunities. The residual effects, as seen above, on hunting, and plant gathering were assessed as moderate magnitude, and fishing was low. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation, which could affect use and enjoyment of culturally and spiritually important sites. Increased noise levels extend 1.5 km from the Project (EIA, CR#2, CIAR#42). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). 2.Experience of engaging with sites of cultural or spiritual value: Loss or disturbance to important sites due to the mine site and access road. Loss of experience in hunting, fishing, and plant gathering, which could affect the cultural and spiritual relationships with the resource. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation, which could affect enjoyment or experience of using culturally and spiritually important sites. 3.Cultur al values associated with sites/features: Loss of hunting, fishing, and plant gathering opportunities, which could affect intergenerational teaching of traditional practices, and result in loss of cultural identity, sense of place, and human health/well- being. Loss of access to sites/features due to construction and operation activities. Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features as a result of clearing and construction activities. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construc tion and operation, which could affect enjoyment or experience of engaging with the sites/features of cultural or spiritual v alue. In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to sites with cultural or spiritual value, change the experience of using these sites, and change the cultural value associated with sites and features. There will be residual effects on cultural and spiritual values for Tsuut'ina Nation during construction and operation due to loss of access to culturally or spiritually important sites and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on cultural and spiritual values is characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the values adexperience associated with cultural or spiritual sites for the Tsuut'ina Nation through direct disturbance and change in noise and air quality. However, this will not affect the ability to use or access sites associated with cultural and spiritual values in the RSA. The Tsuut'ina Nation consider many traditional practices conducted in and around the project site as holding cultural and spiritual value. Hunting has important cultural and spiritual values; intergenerational knowledge is shared while hunting. Plant gathering activities are likewise linked to intangible values with spiritual, artistic, and aesthetic elements (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 8.3.1.6, CIAR #251). In addition to a direct change to cultural and spiritual values and associated features, it is expected that the visual and sensory experience of visiting these locations will also change. The Project will cause a certain change in noise, dust and a visual disturbance (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 8.3.2.6, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because the loss of experience in hunting, fishing, and plant gathering could affect the long -term cultural and spiritual relationships between Indigenous groups and their resources and territory. Change in land use andaccess will extend beyond the Project lifespan. Continuous frequency during due to continuous mine disturbance (loss ofvegetation, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Non- reversible because loss of cultural and spiritual sites and experience in engaging in land use could result in loss of the knowledge of cultura l and spiritual values. Ecological and social context is sensitive because loss of engagement in land use affects cultural identity, human well- being and relationships, and intergenerational transfer of knowledge. The Tsuut'ina Nation has indicated that the Project area has been one of the most preferred sites for Tsuut'ina Elders to conduct spiritual ceremonies (Addendum 10, JRP IR -4.6, Table 4.6-5, CIAR #251).BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 104 Table 6.7-6a Description and characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cul tural Heritage for the Tsuut'ina Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Physical and Cultural Heritage 1.Physical and cultural heritage: Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage as a result of clearing and construction activities. The geographic extent of residual effects on historical resources is local (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). 2.Access to physical and cultural heritage: Loss or disruption of trails to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage due to the mine site and access road. The magnitude of effects on trails and travelways was characterized as moderate. 3.Cultural value and importance associated with physical and cultural heritage: Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could result in reduced engagement with the sites/features of cultural value. Magnitude was assessed as high for TEK plant species (EIA, CR#8, CIAR #42), whereas magnitude is low to moderate for hunted and trapped wildlife (EIA, CR#9, CIAR #42). Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage as a result of clearing and construction activities. The magnitude of effects on cultural and spiritual values was characterized as moderate. 4.Relationship with physical and cultural heritage: Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42) and access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42), but for those VCs that affect the relationships with physical and cultural heritage ( e.g., air quality, noise, plant gathering, hunting and trapping), magnitude is assessed as high for odour and low to moderate for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42), and moderate for hunting and plant gathering. Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage as a result of clearing and construction a ctivities could result in loss of relationship with heritage. Loss of hunting, fishing, and plant gathering opportunities due to construction and operation and access restrictions could result in loss of relationship with wildlife and cultural practices. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could result in reduced enga gement with the sites/features associated with physical or cultural heritage. In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to physical and cultural heritage, change the value and importance, and change the relationship the Tsuut'ina Nation have with these sites. There will be residual effects on Indigenous physical and cultural heritage for Tsuut'ina Nation during construction and operation due to loss of access and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on physical and cultural heritage are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the access toand value of physical and cultural heritage for the Tsuut'ina Nation. The Tsuut'ina Nation has a strong spiritual and cultural connection with the land in and around the proposed Project area. There are sites sacred to the Nation in the Crowsnest Pass and surrounding area, including ceremonial sites and natural material to make ceremonial paint and items. The Project area and its associated features are used for spiritual purposes, including ceremonies (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 8.3.1.6, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because disturbance to or loss of unique sites and features will extend beyond the Project lifespan. Regular frequency because disturbance to unique sites and features will occur during construction and operation activities whenever sites or features are discovered. Non- reversible because loss of heritage sites and features and experience in engaging in land use coul d result in loss of the knowledge of cultural heritage. Ecological and social context is sensitive because loss of heritage sites andfeatures or loss of engagement with physical and cultural heritage affects cultural identity, human well- being and relationships, and intergenerational transfer of knowledge. The Tsuut'ina Nation has indicated that the ability to pass on storiesis tied to taking the next generation out on the land, which could be impeded bythe Project (Addendum 10, JRP IR -4.6, Table MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 105 In summary, the residual effects characterization has not changed from that already provided. As such, the summary Table 8.4.4-1 from An Updated Assessment of the Potential Effects of the Grassy Mountain Project on Indigenous Groups (Appendix 4.1-1, Addendum 10, CIAR#251) is provided below. A correction to the table has been made. The text in Section 8, Appendix 4.1-1 correctly identifies the duration for hunting as long -term, however it was incorrectly copied into the table. Therefore, the table has been updated to correct that error and is presented below as Table 6.7-6b.

A summary table of this characterizatio n was provided as Table 9.4.4-1 (Appendix 4.1-1: An Updated Assessment of the Potential Effects of the Grassy Mountain Project on Indigenous Groups , Addendum 10, CIAR#251), and is copied below for the convenie nce of the reader, as Table 6.7-7b. Table 6.7-7a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Ktunaxa Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Charac terization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Hunting 1. Hunted species and habitat: The Project will have temporary effects on land access for traditional resource use and on the distribution and abundance of species hunted for traditional purposes. Species preferring recently disturbed and young habitats are expected to return first, followed by species preferring increasingly older habitat types with reclamation. Moose and Elk: Suitable moose and elk habitat will decline initially but is predicted to be more abundant than baseline levels by end of mine due, in part, to reclamation of legacy mine sites that overlap the Project footprint (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.6.2.1, CIAR #42). The changes in abundance of moose and elk year -round in the WLS A are expected to follow a similar pattern as individuals of both species will be displaced into adjacent habitats. Grizzly Bear: Highly suitable grizzly bear habitat in the WLSA will decrease initially during the construction and operation phases and then increase throughout the duration of progressive reclamation. Mortality risk also increases with Project development but then decreases with progressive reclamation. With reclamation, the Project footprint is expected to offer more suitable habitat (dietary resources) and lower mortality risk thanunder baseline conditions, which are anticipated to allow for an increase in the size of the grizzly bear population that the local area can support. Wildlife Residual Effects (EIA, CR#9, Table 5.3-26, CIAR #42): Effects on habitat availability for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) due to vegetation clearing and sensory disturbance (due to increased noise, odour, visual disturbance) are low magnitude, positive Project contribution, and reversible in the long-term. Effects on wildlife movement for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) due to construction and operation are low magnitude, and reversible in the long- term. Effects on wildlife abundance for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) in hunting location is low magnitude, positive Project contribution for elk and grizzly bear, neutral Project contribution for moose, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife mortality risk for hunted species due to construction activities, vehicle collisions, and human- wildlife conflicts are low magnitude, frequency is occasional, and reversible in the long -term. With the Access Control Policy and firearm prohibition by Project personnel, poaching and non -Indigenous hunting of moose, elk, and grizzly bear will decline in the WLSA during the life of mine and may result in increased abundance of moose, elk, and grizzly bear in the areas accessible by Indigenous groups (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.6.2.1, CIAR #42). A screening level wildlife risk assessment was conducted, the results of which indicate that there is no potential risk of adverse effects associated with Project emissions on the health of wildlife in the study areas(Addendum 10, Appendix 4.9-1, Section 8.0, Updated Human Health and Wildlife Screening Risk Assessment, CIAR #251). The wildlife risk assessment was amended to include an evaluation of water -based exposure pathways (both groundwater and surface water) and the results presented for Blairmore Creek, Gold Creek and th e Oldman Reservoir were not considered to be indicative of adverse effects (Addendum 11, JRP IR -6.28). For the proposed end pit lake (EPL) (at closure), the results of the risk assessment are not considered indicative of a human health concern; however, management considerations of the EPL are warranted and actual measured concentrations at the time of EPL creation should be used to revisit predicted effects (Addendum 11, JRP IR -6.27). The assessment includes an Indigenous -specific conceptual model, which describes sourcepathway lin kages between the Project and Indigenous use of all aquatic pathways including the end pit lake, Blairmore and Gold Creeks, the Crowsnest River and the Oldman Reservoir in the post closure landscape. 2. Use or access to hunting locations and harvesting methods: Where Project construction and operations activities overlap with hunting locations, access to active mining areas may be limited until they are reclaimed and safe. Indigenous groups will continue to have access to hunting and trapping locations where safety is not compromised (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). The Project's access restrictions within the mine permit area may also affect Indigenous groups' ability to use their preferred harvesting methods and seasonal rounds by altering the times of year that Indigenousgroups have access to areas of interest for hunting within the mine permit area (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as moderate magnitude Increased noise, odour , and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of locations and the experience of hunting within the vicinity of the Project (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89); residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust ( EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42): The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). Where Indigenous groups utilize firearms for hunting, the Project's firearms restriction policy would affect their ability to use that harvesting method within the mine footprint. Alternate hunting methods may be possible in parts of the mine footprint that have not yet been disturbed or which have been reclaimed under the AMP (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.3, CIAR #89). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified hunted species and habitat, change use or access to identified hunting locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on hunting for Ktu naxa Nation due to reduction in hunting opportunities, engagement in hunting, and hunting success during construction and ope ration due to loss of access to hunting locations, sensory disturbance, and change in wildlife use within the mine permit area. Residual effects on hunting are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to hunt in the area but this does not change the ability to hunt in the RSA. Although the Ktunaxa Nation has not identified site- specific hunting areas within the Project assessment area, hunting remains important to the Ktunaxa Nation for subsistence as well as guide- #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency because loss of hunting opportunities will be continuous throughout construction and oper ation. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation is planned andexpected to re- establish natural processes and ecosystems that support hunted species and access will be restored following the AMP. Ecological and social context is sensitive because the Project is in an area valuedby Ktunaxa citizens for wildlife habitat for culturally -important species that are critical to Ktunaxa harvesting and stewardship and hunting remains important tothe Ktunaxa Nation for subsistence as well as guide -outfittin (Addendum 10, JRP IR -4.6, Table #251).BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 107 Table 6.7-7a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Ktunaxa Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Charac terization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Trapping 1. Trapped species and habitat: The Project will have temporary effects on land access for traditional resource use and on the distribution and abundance of species trapped for traditional purposes. Species preferring recently disturbed and young habitats are expected to return first, followed by species preferring increasingly older habitat types with reclamation. Canada Lynx: There is a loss of lynx habitat in the WLSA. The loss of effective habitat, along with sensory disturbances associated with the Project, will likely displace lynx to other more suitable undisturbed habitats located west, north and east of the WLSA. Canada lynx rarely use the area around the access road, so it is not expected to have significant effects on lynx movement. American Marten: There will be a temporary , long- term loss of habitat for American marten. Reclamation of disturbed areas will occur throughout and after the life of the Pro ject; however, American martens prefer mature to old- growth coniferous forests, which will take many decades to become re-es tablished. East- west movements of American marten will likely be affects by the Project footprint since they tend to avoid open landscapes. The access road and coal conveyor will also likely affect marten movements. North -south marten movements along Bl airmore and Gold Creeks should be relatively unaffected by Project development. With mitigation, Project effects on American marten habitat availability and movement in the WLSA are expected to be local in extent, extended in duration, continuous in frequency, reversible in the long -term, moderate in magnitude for habitat availability and low for movement (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.3.6.1, CIAR#42). Wildlife Residual Effects (EIA, CR#9, Table 5.3-26, CIAR #42): Effects on habitat availability for trapped species (lynx, American marten) due to vegetation clearing and sensory disturbance (due to increased noise, odour, visual disturbance) are mod erate magnitude, negative Project contribution, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife movement for trapped species (lynx, American marten) due to construction and operation are low magnitude, and reversible in the long-term. Effects on wildlife abundance for trapped species (lynx, American marten) in hunting locations due to is low magnitude, negative Project contribution and, for American marten, reversible in the long -term and for the Canada lynx, reversible in the short term. Effects on wi ldlife mortality risk for trapped species (lynx, American marten) due to construction activities, vehicle collisions, and human- wildlife conflicts are low magnitude, frequency is occasional, and reversible in the short term. 2. Use or access to trapping locations and harvesting methods: Where Project construction and operations activities overlap with hunting and trapping locations, access to active mining areas may be limited until they are reclaimed and safe. Indigenous groups will continue tohave access to hunting and trapping locations where safety is not compromised (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). The Project's access restrictions within the mine permit area may also affect Indigenous groups' ability to use their preferr ed harvesting methods and seasonal rounds by altering the times of year that Indigenous groups have access to areas of interest for hunting/trapping within the mine permit area (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). Loss or disruption of traplines or trails used for trapping and loss of access to trapping locations due to the mine site and road closure during construction and operation. The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as low magnitude. Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construct ion and operation could affect use of locations and the experience of hunting within the vicinity of the Project (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89); residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42): The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectab le odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified trapped species and habitat, change use or access to identified trapping locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on trapping for Ktunaxa Nation due to reduction or loss of trapping opportunities and the change in trapping methods could affect the cultural and spiritual relationship between the Nation and their territory, which is addressed below. Residual effects on trapping are characterized as: Magnitude is low because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to trap in the area but this does not change the ability of Ktunaxa Nation to trap in the RSA.The Ktunaxa Nation do not currently actively trap within the Project assessment area: the Nation has not identified site- specific trapping in the Project assessment area (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 9.3.1.2, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long-term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will applybeyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency because loss of trapping opportunities will be continuousthroughout construction and operation. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation is planned andexpected to re- establish natural processes and ecosystems that support trapped species and access will be restored following the AMP. Ecological and social context is sensitive because the Project area and Crowsnest Pass contain ecological values tied to harvesting practices, including trapping and current use of the Project assessment area for trapping has been impeded si nce coal mining began in the 1900s (Addendum 10, JRP IR -4.6, Table 4.6-6 CIAR #251).BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 108 Table 6.7-7a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Ktunaxa Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Charac terization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Fishing 1. Fishing species and habitat: Westslope Cutthroat Trout (WSCT) The physical footprint of surface water management infrastructure and open pits will cause permanent change to WSCT habitat. The loss of riparian and aquatic habitat will be reversed by gains achieved through implementing an Offsetting Plan approved by DFO. The magnitude of this effect will be moderate, the duration is long, the frequency will be continuous, however, reversibility is characterized as reversible in the long- term. (Addendum 1, CR#6, Section 4.5, CIAR #44). Changes in hydrology will cause alteration in WSCT aquatic habitat of Gold and Blairmore creeks. The alteration of habitat will b e offset by gains achieved through implementing an Offsetting Plan approved by DFO. The magnitude of residual adverse effects will be moderate, the duration is extended, the frequency will be continuous, however, reversibility is characterized as rever sible in the long -term. (Addendum 1, CR#6, Section 4.5, CIAR #44). 2. Use or access to fishing locations and harvesting methods: Current access to the portions of the watercourses adjacent to Grassy Mountain is located on Benga private land. During constr uction and operation phases of the mine, this road will be closed to the general public, and alternate routes will need to be used to access and fish those portions of Blairmore and Gold Creeks (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.2.1.2, CIAR #89) which will be managed via the AMP. Loss or disruption of trails for accessing fishing locations due to the mine site and road closure during construction and operation. The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as low magnitude (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 9.3.3.5, CIAR #251). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moder ate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of fishing locations by Indigenous Nations and preferred harvesting method. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition o f the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1 CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effect s on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to identified fishing locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on fishing for Ktunaxa Nation due to reduction in fishing opportunities, engagement in fishing, and fishing success during construction and operation due to loss of access to fishing locations and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on fishing are characterized as: Magnitude is low because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to fish in the area but this does not change the ability of Ktunaxa Nation to fish in the RSA.The Ktunaxa Nation does not currently actively fish within the Project assessment area and has not identified s ite-specific current use in the Project area for fishing. Historical fishing locations identified in literature are located outside of the Project assessment area (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 9.3.1.3, CIAR #251). There is predicted to be a change in the ability to fish for Ktunaxa Nation. Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because access restrictions will apply beyond the life of the mine in some areas that may affect access to fishing locations. Continuous frequency because loss of fishing opportunities will be continuousthroughout construction and operation. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because offsetting is planned andexpected to maintain fish populations and access will be restored following the AMP. Ecological and social context is resilient because the Ktunaxa Nation does not currently actively fish in the Project area and has not identified site-specific current use in the Project area for fishing. Fishing locations are located outside of the LSA ( Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 9.3.1.3, CIAR #251). Therefore, Nation engagement in fishing is not sensitive to disruptionfrom the Project. Plant Gathering 1. Plant species and habitat: The Project will result in loss of traditional use of vegetation within the vegetation local study area. Residual effects to TEK vegetation are local, long -term in duration, continuous, reversible and high magnitude. The Project will have a neutral contribution with respect to valued species and communities. After reclamation, the reclaimed land will support a range of communities with equivalent capabilities to those of the surrounding lands and that existing prior to Project developmen t. Residual adverse effects on vegetation were assessed as high magnitude for rare plants, community diversity, and TEK species, low magnitude for forest, and moderate for wetlands (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). Duration of effects on vegetation will be extended. Reclaimed land will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports traditional use plants (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.1, CIAR #42). Frequency of effects on vegetation, including rare plants and rare plant communities and traditional ecological knowledge, will be continuous through the operational phase of the project and cease only after reclamation is completed (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). Effects on vegetation are reversible in the long -term with the implementation of progressive reclamation (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). 2. Use or access to plant gathering locations and harvesting methods: Loss or disruption of trails, loss of access to plant gathering locations, and loss of and preferred methods for plant gather ing due to the mine site and access road. Residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as low magnitude. Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for em issions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of plant gathering locations by Indigenous Nations and preferred harvesting method. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42,). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3 CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified plant gathering species and habitat, change use or access to identified harvesting locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on plant gathering for Ktunaxa Nation due to reduction in harvesting opportunities, engagement in plant gathering, and harvesting success during construction and operation due to loss of access to plant gathering locations and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on plant gathering are characterized as: Magnitude is low. The Ktunaxa Nation did not identify site- specific current use of plant gathering in and around the Project area, therefore the magnitude of effect has been characterized as low (Section 9.3.1.4, Appendix 4.1-1, Addendum 10). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency due to continuous mine disturbance (loss of vegetation, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation (of terrain, soil, vegetation) is planned and expected to re-establish natural processes and ecosystems that support traditional use plants (high density planting of disease- resistant whitebark pine seedlings will contribute to the successful re-establishment of the native ecosystem); and, access to plant gathering locationswill be re -established after mine closure. Ecological and social context is resilient because Ktunaxa Nation current plant gathering sites are outside the Project area ( e.g., Crowsnest Pass) and Ktunaxa Nation did not identify site- specific current use in the Project area for plant gathering. Therefore, Ktunaxa Nation engagement in plant gathering is not sensitive to disruption from the Project.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 109 Table 6.7-7a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Ktunaxa Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Charac terization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Trails and Travelways 1. Use or access to trails and travelways: Loss or disruption of trails and travelways due to the mine site and access road. The Project will have residual adverse effects on use of trails and travelways because the Project could result in loss of trails and travelways that are fully or partially within the mine permit boundary. The Project footprint will be reclaimed to land use capability equivalent to pre- mining; however, it will not be accessible for use as trails and travelways during construction and operations. Access to ar eas around the Project will be possible using existing trails from Highway 40 to reach the area west of Bl airmore Creek and Crown Land north of the Project and from either the north or the south along the Gold Creek. With the implementation of the AMP, potential residual effects will be further reduced as Benga will be providing access to adjacent privately owned Benga lands for traditional practices (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 9.3.3.5, CIAR #251). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of trails and travelways by Indigenous Natio ns. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short-ter m (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). 2. Features associated with trails and travelways: Loss or disturbance to features associated with trails and travelways due to the mine site and access road. Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude after reclamation (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to within the zone of influence (generally 1.5 km) for noise, vi sual disturbance, and effect on access ( EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). The geographic extent of residual effects on historical resources and on land and resource use is characterized as local ( EIA, CR#10, Section E, CIAR #42). The frequency of impact on access and utilities in the lands and resource use is continuous ( EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). The frequency of impact of noise and other disturbances to trail use will continue throughout the Project lifespan ( EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access and change preferred trails and travelways. There will be residual effects on trails and travelways for Ktunaxa Nation due to restriction in use or access, and engagement with features associated with trails and travelways during construction and operation due to loss of access to trails and travelways locations, sensory disturbance, and ch ange in use w ithin the mine permit area. Residual effects on trails and travelways are characterized as: Magnitude is low because although there is predicted to be a change in the ability access routes by Ktunaxa Nation in the Project area and there are several trailsand travelways used by the Ktunaxa Nation for movement through the Rocky Mountains that directly intersect the Project area, the Ktunaxa Nation does not currently actively use the trails and travelways that are within the Project assessment area (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 9.3.1.5, CIAR #251). This will not change the ability of Ktunaxa Nation to access trails and travelways in the RSA. Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency during construction and operation due to continuous m ine disturbance (loss of vegetation, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Non-r eversible where trails and travelways are lost because when a trail is inaccessible it will not be maintained or used, resulting in the potential loss of the knowledge of or loss of the physical trail or travelway. Ecological and social context is resilient because Ktunaxa Nation does not currently actively use the trails and travelways within the Project area (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section CIAR #251). Trails and travelways used by the Ktunaxa Nation for movement through the Rocky Mountains to and from the plains intersect areas to the north and south of the Project. Therefore, Ktunaxa Nation trails and travelways is not sensitive to disruption from the Project. Cultural and Spiritual Values 1. Use and access to sacred important sites with cultural or spiritual value: Residual adverse effects on access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42). Loss or disruption of trails to important sites due to the mine site and access road. Loss of hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering opportunities. The residual effects, as seen above, on hunting was assessed as moderate magnitude, and trapping, plant gathering and fishing were assessed as low magnitude. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during const ruction and operation, which could affect use and enjoyment of culturally and spiritually important sites. Increased noise levels extend 1.5 km from the Project (EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). 2. Exper ience of engaging with sites of cultural or spiritual value: Loss or disturbance to important sites due to the mine site and access road. Loss of experience in hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering, which could affect the cultural and spiritual relationships with the resource. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation, which could affect enjoyment or experience of using culturally and spiritually important sites. 3. Cultural values associated with sites/features Loss of hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering opportunities, which could affect intergenerational teaching of traditional practices, and result in loss of cultural identity, sense of place, and human health/well- being. Loss of access to sites/features due to construction and operation activities. Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features as a result of clearing and construction activities. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation, which could affect enjoyment or experience of engaging with the sites/features of cultural or spiritual value. In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to sites with cultural or spiritual value, change the experience of using these sites, and change the cultural value associated with sites and features. There will be residual effects on cultural and spiritual values for Ktunaxa Nation during construction and operation due to loss of access to culturally or spiritually important sites and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on cultural and spiritual values is characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in cultural andspiritual values for the Ktunaxa Nation in the Project area. The Ktunaxa Nation has expressed that the Project area and the Crowsnest Pass contain a multitude of ecological values tied to cultural and spiritual use and stewardship of the landscape. Hunting, fish, and plant gathering have important cultural and spiritual considerations, including sharing intergenerational knowledge during these activities (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 9.3.1.6, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because the loss of experience in hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering could affect the long -term cultural and spiritual relationships between Indigenous groups and their resources and territory. Change in land useand access will extend beyond the Project lifespan. Continuous frequency during due to continuous mine disturbance (loss ofvegetation, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Non- reversible because loss of cultural and spiritual sites and experience in engaging in land use could result in loss of the knowledge of cultural and spiritual values. Ecological and social context is sensitive because loss of engagement in land use affects cultural identity, human well-b eing and relationships, and intergenerational transfer of knowledge. Archival and oral histories indicate that the Ktunaxa rely on the Project area for preferred cultural- spiritual practices including teaching of oral histories and transmission of knowled ge LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 110 Table 6.7-7a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Ktunaxa Nation Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Charac terization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Physical and Cultural Heritage 1. Physical and cultural heritage: Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage as a result of clearing and constr uction activities. The geographic extent of residual effects on historical resources is local (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). 2. Access to physical and cultural heritage: Loss or disruption of trails to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage due to the mine site and access road. The magnitude of effects on trails and travelways was characterized as low. 3. Cultural value and importance associated with physical and cultural heritage: Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could result in reduced engagement with the sites/features of cultural value. Magnitude was assessed as high for TEK plant species (CEAR #42, EIA, CR#8) whereas magnitude is low to moderate for hunted and trapped wildlife (CEAR #42, EIA, CR#9). Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage as a result of clearing and construction activities. The magnitude of effects on cultural and spiritual values was characterized as moderate. 4. Relationship with physical and cultural heritage: Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42) and access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitu de (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42), but for those VCs that affect the relationships with physical and cultural heritage ( e.g., air quality, noise, plant gathering, hunting and trapping), magnitude is assessed as high for odour and low to moderate for emissions inclu ding dust (EIA, CR#1 CIAR #42), moderate for hunting, and low for plant gathering, trapping and fishing. Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage as a result of clearing and construction activities could result in loss of relationship with heritage. Loss of hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering opportunities due to construction and operation and access restrictions could result in loss of relationship with wildlife and cultural practices. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could result in reduced engagement with the sites/features associated with physical or cultural heritage. In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to physical and cultural heritage, change the value and importance, and change the relationship the Ktunaxa Nation have with these sites. There will be residual effects on Indigenous physical and cultural heritage for Ktunaxa Nation during construction and operation due to loss of access and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on Indigenous physical and cultural heritage are characterized as: Magnitude is moderate because there is predicted to be a change in access to or engagement with physical and cultural heritage for the Ktunaxa Nation in the area, but this does not change access to or engagement with physical and cultural heritage in the RSA. The Ktunaxa Nation identified several cultural, ceremonial and spiritual sites throughout the Crowsnest Pass including during visits to the Project area. One site- specific cultural site was reported in the category of cultural activity within the LSA (unclear whether this is in a cultural heritage site or an area of use) (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 9.3.1.6, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term dura tion because disturbance to or loss of unique sites and features will extend beyond the Project lifespan. Regular frequency because disturbance to unique sites and features will occur during construction and operation activities whenever sites or features are discovered. Non- reversible because loss of heritage sites and features and experience in engaging in land use could result in loss of the knowledge of cultural heritage. Ecological and social context is sensitive because loss of heritage sites andfeatures or loss of engagement with physical and cultural heritage affects cultural identity, human well- being, and intergenerational transfer of knowledge. Certain sites and areas are considered especially sensitive, sacred, and tied to Ktunaxa Nation oral h LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 111 In summary, the residual effects characterization has not changed greatly from that already provided. The changes from the previous effects characterization is that the magnitude for trapping and trails and travelways have been corrected from moderate to low, an d the physical and cultural heritage reversibility has been corrected from reversible to not- reversible for the reasons explained above. As such, the summary Table 9.4.4- 1 from An Updated Assessment of the Potential Effects of the Grassy Mountain P roject on Indigenous Groups (Appendix 4.1-1, Addendum 10, CIAR#251) is provided below with these corrections, and is presented as Table 6.7-7b.

A summary table of this characterization was provided as Table 10.4.2-1 (Appendix 4.1- 1: An Updated Assessment of the Potential Effects of the Grassy Mountain Project on Ind igenous Groups , Addendum 10, CIAR#251), and is copied below for the convenience of the reader, and presented as Table 6.7-8b. Table 6.7-8a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Samson Cree Natio n Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Hunting 1. Hunted species and habitat: The Project will have temporary effects on land access for traditional resource use and on the distribution and abundance of species hunted for traditional purposes. Species preferring recently disturbed and young habitats are expected to return first, followed by species preferring increasingly older habitat types with reclamation. Moose and Elk: Suitable moose and elk habitat will decline initially but is predicted to be more abundant than baseline levels by end of mine due, in part, to reclamation of legacy mine sites that overlap the Project footprint (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.6.2.1, CIAR #42). The changes in abundance of moose and elk year -round in the WLSA are expected to follow a similar pattern as individuals of both species will be displaced into adjacent habitats. Grizzly Bear: Highly suitable grizzly bear habitat in the WLSA will decrease initially during the construction and operation phases and then increase throughout the duration of progressive reclamation. Mortality risk also increases with Project development but then decreases with progressive reclamation. With reclamation, the Project footprint is expected to offer more suitable habitat (dietary resources) and lower mortality risk than under baseline conditions, which are anticipated to allow for an increase in the size of the grizzly bear population that the local area can support. Wildlife Residual Effects (EIA, CR#9, Table 5.3-26, CIAR #42): Effects on habitat availability for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) due to vegetation clearing and sensory disturbance (due to increased noise, odour, visual disturbance) are low magnitude, positive Project contribution, and reversible in the lo ng-term. Effects on wildlife movement for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) due to construction and operation are low magnitude, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife abundance for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) in hunting location is low magnitude, positive Project contribution for elk and grizzly bear, neutral Project contributio n for moose, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife mortality risk for hunted species due to construction activities, vehicle coll isions, and human- wildlife conflicts are low magnitude, frequency is occasional, and reversible in the long -term . With the Access Control Policy and firearm prohibition by Project personnel, poaching and non -Indigenous hunting of moose, elk, and grizzly bear will decline in the WLSA during the life of mine and may result in increased abundance of moose, elk, and gr izzly bear in the areas accessible by Indigenous groups (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.6.2.1, CIAR #42). A screening level wildlife risk assessment was conducted, the results of which indicate that there is no potential risk of adverse effects associated with Project emissions on the health of wildlife in the study areas(Addendum 10, Appendix 4.9-1, Section 8.0, Updated Human Health and Wildlife Screening Risk Assessment, CIAR #251) . The wildlife risk assessment was amended to include an evaluation of water -based exposure pathways (both groundwater and surface water) and the results presented for Blairmore Creek, Gold Creek and the Oldman Reservoir were not considered to be indicative of adverse effects (Addendum 11, JRP IR -6.28). For the proposed end pit lake (EPL) ( at closure), the results of the risk assessment are not considered indicative of a human health concern; however, management considerations of the EPL are warranted and actual measured concentrations at the time of EPL creation should be used to revisit predicted effects (Addendum 11, JRP IR -6.27). The assessment includes an Indigenous-specific conceptual model, which describes sourcepathway link ages between the Project and Indigenous use of all aquatic pathways including the end pit lake, Blairmore and Gold Creeks, the Crowsnest River and the Oldman Reservoir in the post closure landscape. 2. Use or access to hunting locations and harvesting methods: Where Project construction and operations activities overlap with hunting locations, access to active mining areas may be limited until they are reclaimed and safe. Indigenous groups will continue to have access tohunting and trapping locations where safety is not compromised (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). The Project's access restrictions within the mine permit area may also affect Indigenous groups' ability to use their preferred harvesting methods and seasonal rounds by altering the times of year that Indigenous groups have access to areas of interest for hunting within the mine permit area (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as low magnitude Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of locations and the experience of hunting within the vicinity of the Project (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR#89); residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42): The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, S ection 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). Where Indigenous groups utilize firearms for hunting, the Project's firearms restriction policy would affect their ability to use that harvesting method within the mine footprint. Alternate hunting methods may be possible in parts of the mine footprint that have not yet been disturbed or which have been reclaimed under the AMP (Addendum 8, Ap pendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.3, CIAR #89). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified hunted species and habitat, change use or access to identified hunting locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on hunting for Samson Cree Nation due to reduction in hunting opportunities, engagement in hunting, and hunting success during construction and operation due to loss of access of hunting locations, sensory disturbance, and change in wildlife use within the mine permit area. Residual effects on hunting are characterized as: Magnitude is low because, although the Samson Cree Nation continue to hunt throughout their traditional territory, no site- specific locations, seasonal use, or method s have been identified for hunting in t he Project area (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Sections 10.3.1.1 and 10.3.2.1, CIAR #251). Therefore, there is predicted to be little change in the ability to hunt for the Samson Cree Nation. Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprintbut limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency because loss of hunting opportunities will be continuousthroughout construction and operation. Reversible because reclamation is planned and expected to re- establish natural processes and ecosystems that support hunted species and access will be restoredfollowing the AMP. Ecological and social context is resilient because, as Samson Cree Nation did not identify hunting areas in the Project area and important cultural areas for Samson Cree Nation are outside the LSA, Samson Cree Nation engagement in hunting is considered not sensitive to disruption from the Project.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 113 Table 6.7-8a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Samson Cree Natio n Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Trapping 1.Trapped species and habitat: The Project will have temporary effects on land access for traditional resource use and on the distribution and abundance of species trapped for traditional purposes. Species preferring recently disturbed and young habitats are expected to return first, followed by species preferring increasingly older habitat types with reclamation. Canada Lynx: There is a loss of lynx habitat in the WLSA. The loss of effective habitat, along with sensory disturbances associated with the Project, will likely displace lynx to other more suitable undisturbed habitats located west, north and east of the WLSA. Canada lynx rarely use the area around the access road, so it is not expected to have significant effects on lynx movement. American Marten: There will be a temporary , long- term loss of habitat for American marten. Reclamation of disturbed areas will occur throughout and after the life of the Project; however, American martens prefer mature to old -growth coniferous forests, which will take many decades to become re-es tablished. East- west movements of American marten will likely be affects by the Project footprint since they tend to avoid open landscapes. The access road and coal conveyor will also likely affect marten movements. North- south marten movements along Bl airmore and Gold Creeks should be relatively unaffected by Project development. With mitigation, Project effects on American marten habitat availability and movement in the WLSA are expected to be local in extent, extended in duration, continuous in frequency, reversible in the long -term, moderate in magnitude for habitat availability and low for movement (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.3.6.1, CIAR #42). Wildlife Residual Effects (EIA, CR#9, Table 5.3-26, CIAR #42): Effects on habitat availability for trapped species (lynx, American marten) due to vegetation clearing and sensory disturbance (due to increased noise, odour, visual disturbance) are moderate magnitude, negative Project contribution, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife movement for trapped species (lynx, American marten) due to construction and operation are low magnitude, and reversible in t he long-term. Effects on wildlife abundance for trapped species (lynx, American marten) in hunting locations due to is low magnitude, negative Project contribution and, for American marten, reversible in the long -term and for the Canada lynx, reversible in the short term . Effects on wildlife mortality risk for trapped species (lynx, American marten) due to construction activities, vehicle collisio ns, and human- wildlife conflicts are low magnitude, frequency is occasional, and reversible in the short term. 2.Use or access to trapping locations and harvesting methods: Where Project construction and operations activities overlap with hunting and trapping locations, access to active mining areas may be limited until they are reclaimed and safe. Indigenous groups will continue to have access to hunting and trapping locations where safety is not compromised (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1. 2, CIAR #89). The Project's access restrictions within the mine permit area may also affect Indigenous groups' ability to use their preferred harvesting methods and seasonal rounds by altering the times of year that Indigenous groupshave access to areas of interest for hunting/trapping within the mine permit area (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). Loss or disruption of traplines or trails used for trapping and loss of access to trapping locations due to the mine site and road closure during construction and operation. The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as low magnitude. Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of locations and the experience of hunting within the vicinity of the Project (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89); residual adverse effects o n air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissio ns including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42): The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); howe ver, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Tabl e 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified trapped species and habitat, change use or access to identified trapping locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on trapping for Samson Cree Nation due reduction or loss of trapping opportunities and the change in trapping methods could a ffect the cultural and spiritual relationship between the Nation and their territory, which is addressed below. Residual effect s on trapping are characterized as: Magnitude is low because, although the Samson Cree Nation have advised that theyhave an interest in trapping in the Project area, no specific locations, seasonal use, or methods have been identified for trapping in the Project area (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 10.3.1.2, CIAR #251). Therefore, there is predicted to be little change in the ability to trap for the Samson Cree Nation. Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency because l oss of hunting opportunities will be continuous throughout construction and operation. Reversible because reclamation is planned and expected to re- establish natural processes and ecosystems that support hunted species and access will be restoredfollowing the AMP. Ecological and social context resilient because, as Samson Cree Nation did not identify trapping areas in the Project area and important cultural areas for Samson Cree Nation are outside the LSA, Samson Cree Nation engagement in trapping is consi dered not sensitive to disruption from the Project.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 114 Table 6.7-8a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Samson Cree Natio n Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Fishing 1.Fishing species and habitat: Westslope Cutthroat Trout (WSCT) The physical footprint of surface water management infrastructure and open pits will cause permanent change to WSCT habitat. The loss of riparian and aquatic habitat will be reversed by gains achieved through implementing an Offsetting Plan approved by DFO. The magnitude of this effect will be moderate, the duration is long, the frequency will be continuous, however, reversibility is characterized as reversible in the long - term. (Addendum 1, CR#6, Section 4.5, CIAR #44). Changes in hydrology will cause alteration in WSCT aquatic habitat of Gold and Blairmore creeks. The alteration of habitat will be offset by gains achieved thr ough implementing an Offsetting Plan approved by DFO. The magnitude of residual adverse effects will be moderate, the duration is extended, the frequency will be continuous, however, reversibility is characterized as reversible in the long -term. (Addendum 1, CR#6, Section 4.5, CIAR #44). 2.Use or access to fishing locations and harvesting methods: Current access to the portions of the watercourses adjacent to Grassy Mountain is located on Benga private land. During cons truction and operation phases of the mi ne, this road will be closed to the general public, and alternate routes will need to be used to access and fish those portions of Blairmore and Gold Creeks (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.2.1.2, CIAR #89) which will be managed via the AMP. Loss or disruption of trails for accessing fishing locations due to the mine site and road closure during construction and operation. The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as low magnitude. Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of fishing locatio ns by Indigenous Nations and preferred harvesting method. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1 CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to use or access to identified fishing locations, and change in preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effe cts on fishing for Samson Cree Nation due to reduction in fishing opportunities, engagement in fishing, and fishing success during construction and operation due to loss of access to fishing locations and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on fishing are characterized as: Magnitude is low because there is predicted to be little change in the ability to fish for the Samson Cree Nation. The Samson Cree Nation have advised that they have a fishing interest in the Project area. However, no site- specific information on fish or fishing areas, fishing seasons, or the importance of fishing in the Project area has been provided (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 10.3.1.3, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because access restrictions will apply beyond the life of the mine in some areas that may affect access to fishing locations. Continuous frequency because loss of fishing opportunities will be continuousthroughout construction and operation. Reversible because reclamation and offsetting is planned and expected maintain fishpopulations and access will be restored following the AMP. Ecological and social context is resilient because, as Samson Cree Nation did not identify fishing in the Project area and important cultural areas for Samson Cree Nation are outside the LSA, Samson Cree Nation engagement in fishing is considerednot sensitive to disruption from the Project. Plant Gathering 1.Plant species and habitat: The Project will result in loss of traditional use of vegetation within the vegetation local study area. Residual effects to TEK vegetation are local, long -term in duration, continuous, reversible and high magnitude. The Project will have a neutral contribution with respect to valued species and communities. After reclamation, the reclaimed land will support a range of communities with equivalent capabilities to those of the surrounding lands and that existing prior to Project development. Residual adverse effects on vegetation were assessed as high magnitude for rare plants, community diversity, and TEK species, low magnitude for forest, and moderate for wetlands (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). Duration of effects on vegetation will be extended. Reclaimed land will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports traditional use plants (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.1, CIAR #42). Frequency of effects on vegetation, including rare plants and rare plant communities and traditional ecological knowledge, will be continuous through the operational phase of the project and cease only after reclamation is completed (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). Effects on vegetation are reversible in the long -term with the implementation of progressive reclamation (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). 2.Use or access to plant gathering locations and harvesting methods: Loss or disrupt ion of trails, loss of access to plant gathering locations, and loss of and preferred methods for plant gathering due to the mine site and access road. Residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as low. Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including d ust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could a ffect use of pl ant gathering locations by Indigenous Nations and preferred harvesting method. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42,). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3 CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified plant gathering species and habitat, change use or access to identified harvesting locations, and change in preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on plant gathering for Samson Cree Nation due to reduction in harvesting opportunities, engagement in plant gathering, and harvesting success during construction and operation due to loss of access of plant gathering locations and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on plant gatherin g are character ized as: Magnitude is low because there is predicted to be little change in the ability to gather plants for the Samson Cree Nation. Although Samson Cree Nation stated that there are important gathering and cultivation sites in proximity to the Project for plants that are used for medicinal, ceremonial and dietary purposes as well as for traditional teachings, no site- specific information was provided (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 10.3.1.4, CIAR #251) . Local geographic extent because residual effects will ex tend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some ar eas. Cont inuous frequency due to continuous mine disturbance (loss of vegetation, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation (of terrain, soil, vegetation) is planned and expected to re-establish natural processes and ecosystems that support traditional use plants (high density planting of disease- resistant whitebark pine seedlings will contribute to the successful re- establishment of the native ecosystem); and, access to plant gathering locations will be re -established after mine closure. Ecological and social context is resilient because important cultural areas for SamsonCree Nation are outside the LSA and the Project area is marginally used by Samson Cree Nation for plant gatherin g. Therefore, Samson Cree Nation engagement in plant gathering is considered not sensitive to disruption from the Project.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 115 Table 6.7-8a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Samson Cree Natio n Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Trails and Travelways 1.Use or access to trails and travelways: Loss or disruption of trails and travelways due to the mine site and access road. The Project will have residual adverse effects on use of trails and travelways because the Project could result in loss of trails and travelways that are fully or partially within the mine permit boundary. The Project footprint will be reclaimed to land use capability equivalent to pre- mining; however, it will not be accessible for use as trails and travelways during construction and operations. Access to ar eas around the Project will be possible using existing trails from Highway 40 to reach the area west of Blairmore Creek and Crown Land north of the Project and from either the north or the south along the Gold Creek. With the implementation of the AMP, potential residual effects will be further reduced as Benga will be providing access to adjacent privately owned Benga lands for traditional practices (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 10.3.3.5, CIAR #251). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of trails and travelways by In digenous Nations. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could b e used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). 2.Features associated with trails and travelways: Loss or disturbance to features associated with trails and travelways due to the mine site and access road. Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude after reclamatio n (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to within the zone of influence (generally 1.5 km) for noise, visual disturbance, and effect on access ( EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). The geographic extent of residual effects on historical resources and on land and resource use is characterized as local ( EIA, CR#10, Section E, CIAR #42). The frequency of impact on access and utilities in the lands and resource use is continuous ( EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). The frequency of impact of noise and other disturbances to trail use will continue throughout the Project lifespan ( EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access and change preferred trails and travelways. There will be residual effects on trails and travelways for Samson Cree Nation due to restriction in use or access, and engagement with features associated with trails and travelways during construction and operation due to loss of access to trails and travelways locations, sensory disturbance, and change in use within the mine permit area. Residual effec ts on trails and travelways is charac terized as: Magnitude is low. Samson Cree Nation advised that trail networks are locatedthroughout their traditional territory; however, they did not advise of any trails or travelways of importance or use in the Project area (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 10.3.1.5, CIAR #251). There is predicted to be little change in the use or access to trails and travelways for the Samson Cree Nation. Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mi ne footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency during construction and operation due to continuous mine disturbance (loss of vegetation, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Reversible as Samson Cree Nation did not identify any trails or travelways in andaround the Project area. Ecological and social context is resilient because, as Samson Cree Nation did not identify trails and travelways in the Project area and important cultural areas for Samson Cree Nation are outside the LSA and accessible outside the Project area, Samson Cree Nation trails and travelways is considered not sensitive to disruptionfrom the Project. Cultural and Spiritual Values 1.Use and access to sacred important sites with cultural or spiritual value: Residual adverse effects on access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42). Loss or disruption of trails to important sites due to the mine site and access road. Loss of hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering opportunities. The residual effects, as seen above, on hunting, trapping and plant gathering were assessed as low magnitude. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation, which could affect use and enjoyment of culturally and spiritually important sites. Increased noise levels extend 1.5 km from the Project (EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). 2.Experience of engaging with sites of cultural or spiritual value: Loss or disturbance to important sites due to the mine site and access road. Loss of experience in hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering, which could affect the cultural and spiritual relationships with the resource. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation, which could affect enjoyment or experience of using culturally and spiritually important sites. 3.Cultural values associated with sites/features: Loss of hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering oppor tunities, which could affect intergenerational teaching of traditional practices, and result in loss of cultural identity, sense of place, and human health/well- being. Loss of access to sites/features due to construction and operation activities. Loss of o r damage to unique sites and special features as a result of clearing and construction activities. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation, which could affect enjoyment or experience of engaging with the sites/features of cultural or spiritual value. In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to sites with cultural or spiritual value, change the experience of using these sites, and change the cultural value associated with sites and features. There will be residual effects on cultural and spiritual values for Samson Cree Nation during construction and operation due to loss of access to culturally or spiritually important sites and sensory disturbance within the mine permit ar ea. Residual effects on cultural and spiritual values are characterized as: Magnitude is low. Samson Cree Nation notes the region of the Project holds spiritual importance for its members; however, they have not identified current or historic use for sacr ed sites, gathering sites, or habitation sites in the Project area (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 10.3.1.6, CIAR #251). There is predicted to be little change in cultural and spiritual values for the Samson Cree Nation. Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because the loss of experience in hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering could affect the long -term cultural and spiritual relationships between Indigenous groups and their resources and territory. Change in land use and accesswill extend beyond the Project lifespan. Continuous frequency during due to continuous mine disturbance (loss of vegetation,access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Non- reversible because loss of cultural and spiritual sites and experience in engaging in land use could result in loss of the knowledge of cultural and spiritual values. Ecological and social context is resilient because, as Samson Cree Nation did not identify cultural and spiritual values in the Project area and important cultural areas f or Samson Cree Nation are outside the LSA, Samson Cree Nation cultural and spiritual values is considered not sensitive to disruption from the Project.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 116 Table 6.7-8a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage for the Samson Cree Natio n Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Physical and Cultural Heritage 1.Physical and cultural heritage: Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage as a result of clearing and construction activities. The geographic extent of residual effects on historical resources is local (CEAR #42, EIA, Section E). 2.Access to physical and cultural heritage: Loss or disruption of trails to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage due to the mine site and access road. The magnitude of effects on trails and travelways was characterized as low. 3.Cultural value and importance associated with physical and cultural heritage: Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could result in reduced engagement with the sites/features of cultural value. Magnitude was assessed as high for TEK plant species (CEAR #42, EIA, CR#8), whereas magnitude is low to moderate for hunted and trapped wildlife (CEAR #42, EIA, CR#9). Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage as a result of clearing and construction activities. The magnitude of effects on cultural and spiritual values was characterized as low. 4.Relationship with physical and cultural heritage: Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E , CIAR #42) and access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42), but for those VCs that affect the relationships with physical and cultural heritage ( e.g., air quality, noise, plant gathering, huntin g and trapping), magnitude is assessed as high for odour and low to moderate for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1 CIAR #42), and low for hunting, trapping and plant gathering. Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features associated with physical or cultural heritage as a result of clearing and construction activities could result in loss of relationship with heritage. Loss of hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering opportunities due to construction and operation and access restrictio ns could result in loss of relationship with wildlife and cultural practices. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could result in reduced engagement with the sites/features associated with physical or cultural heritage. In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to physical and cultural heritage, change the value and importance, and change the relationship the Samson Cree Nation have with these sites. There will be residu al effects on Indigenous physical and cultural heritage for Samson Cree Nation during construction and operation due to loss of access and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on Indigenous physical and cultural heritage are ch aracterized as: Magnitude is low. Although the Samson Cree Nation have advised that they have aninterest in hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering in the Project area, nospecific locations, seasonal use, or methods have been identified in the Pro ject area (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 10.3, CIAR #251). Samson Cree Nation did not identify current or historic use for sacred sites, gathering sites, or habitation sites inthe Project area (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 10.3.1.6, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because disturbance to or loss of unique sites and features will extend beyond the Project lifespan. Regular frequency because disturbance to unique sites and features will occur during construction and operation activities whenever sites or features are discovered. Non- reversible because loss of heritage sites and features and experience in engaging in land use could resu lt in loss of the knowledge of cultural heritage. Ecological and social context is resilient because, as Samson Cree Nation did not identify physical or cultural heritage sites in the Project area and important cultural areas for Samson Cree Nation are outsi de the LSA, Samson Cree Nation physical and cultural heritage is considered not sensitive to disruption from the Project.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 117 In summary, the residual effects characterization has not greatly changed from that already provided. The only change from the previous effects characterization is that the frequency for physical and cultural heritage has been corrected from continuous to regular for the reasons explained above. As such, the summary Table 10.4.2-1 from An Updated Assessment of the Potential Effects of the Grassy Mountain Project on Indigenous Groups (Appendix 4.1 -1, Addendum 10, CIAR#251) is provided below, as Table 6.7-8b.

A summary table of this charact erization was provided as Table 13.4.2-1 (Appendix 4.1- 1: An Updated Assessment of the Potential Effects of the Grassy Mountain Project on Indigenous Groups , Addendum 10, CIAR#251), and is copied below for the convenience of the reader, as Table 6.7-9b. T he results of the characterization are not changed from the conclusions reached in Appendix 4.1-1. Table 6.7-9a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditi onal Purposes and Indigenous Physi cal and Cultural Heritage for the M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Hunting 1. Hunted species and habitat: The Project will have temporary effects on land access for traditional resource use and on the distribution and abundance of species hunted for traditional purpo ses. Species preferring recently disturbed and young habitats are expected to return first, followed by species preferring increasingly older habitat types with reclamation. Moose and Elk: Suitable moose and elk habitat will decline initially but is predicted to be more abundant than baseline levels by end of mine due, in part, to reclamation of legacy mine sites that overlap the Project footprint (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.6.2.1, CIAR #42). The changes in abundance of moose and elk year -round in the WLSA are expected to follow a similar pattern as individuals of both species will be displaced into adjacent habitats. Grizzly Bear: Highly suitable grizzly bear habitat in the WLSA will decrease initially during the construction and operation phases and then increase throughout the duration of progressive reclamation. Mortality risk also increases with Project development but then decreases with progressive reclamation. With reclamation, the Project footprint is expected to offer more suitable habitat (dietary resources) and lower mortality risk than under baseline conditions, which are anticipated to allow for an increase in the size of the grizzly bear population that the local area can support. Wildlife Residual Effects (EIA, CR#9, Table 5.3-26, CIAR #42): Effects on habitat availability for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) due to vegetation clearing and sensory disturbance (due to increased noise, odour, visual disturbance) are low magnitude, positive Project contribution, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife movement for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) due to construction and operation are low magnitude, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife abundance for hunted species (moose, elk, grizzly bear) in hunting location is low magnitude, positive Project contribution for elk and grizzly bear, neutral Project contribution for moose, and reversib le in the long -term. Effects on wildlife mortality risk for hunted species due to construction activities, vehicle collisions, and human -wildlife conflicts are low magnitude, frequency is occasional, and reversible in the long -term. With the Access Contro l Policy and firearm prohibition by Project personnel, poaching and non- Indigenous hunting of moose, elk, and grizzly bear will decline in the WLSA during the life of mine and may result in increased abundance of moose, elk, and grizzly bear in the areas a ccessible by Indigenous groups (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.6.2.1, CIAR #42). A screening level wildlife risk assessment was conducted, the results of which indicate that there is no potential risk of adverse effe cts associated with Project emissions on the health of wildlife in the study areas (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.9-1, Section 8.0, Updated Human Health and Wildlife Screening Risk Assessment, CIAR #251). The wildlife risk assessment was amended to include an evaluation of water -based exposure pathways (both groundwater and surface water) and the results presented for Blairmore Creek, Gold Creek and the Oldman Reservoir were not considered to be indicative of adverse effects (Addendum 11, JRP IR -6.28). For the proposed end pit lake (EPL) (at closure), the results of the risk assessment are not considered indicative of a human health concern; however, management considerations of the EPL are warranted and actual measured concentrations at the time of EPL creation should be used to revisit predicted effects (Addendum 11, JRP IR -6.27). The assessment includes an Indigenous-specific conceptual model, which describes sourcepathway linkages between the Project and Indigenous use of all aquatic pathways including the end pit lake, Blairmore and Gold Creeks, the Crowsnest River and the Oldman Reservoir in the post closure landscape. 2. Use or access to hunting locations and harvesting methods: Where Project construction and operations activities overlap with hunting locations, access to active mining areas may be limited until they are reclaimed and safe. Indigenous groups will continue to have access tohunting and trapping locations where safety is not compromised (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). The Project's access restrictions within the mine permit area may also affect Indigenous groups' ability to use their preferred harvesting methods and seasonal rounds by altering the times of year that Indigenous groupshave access to areas of interest for hunting within the mine permit area (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.2 CIAR #89). The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as low magnitude. Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of locations and the experience of hunting within the vicinity of the Project (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89); residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42): The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). Where Indigenous groups utilize firearms for hunting, the Project's firearms restriction policy would affect their ability to use that harvesting method within the mine footprint. Alternate hunting methods may be possible in parts of the mine footprint that have not yet been disturbed or which have been reclaimed under the AMP (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.3, CIAR #89). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified hunted species and habitat, change use or access to identified hunting locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on hu nting for M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta due to reduction in hunting opportunities, engagement in hunting, and hunting success during construction and operation due to loss of access to hunting locations, sensory disturbance, and change in wildlife use within the mine permit area. Residual effects on hunting are characterized as: Magnitude is low because the Project effects on hunted species (e.g, elk) habitat can be mitigated through the Project wildlife mitigation and monitoring plan. The M\u00e9tisNation of Alberta raised concern about the restricted access of the area around the Project site, which limits their ability to practice traditional land use. However, they believe this may be alleviated by entering into a M\u00e9tis Access Agreement with Riversdale (Addendu m 10, JRP IR -4.6, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency because loss of hunting opportuniti es will be continuous throughout construction and operation. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation is planned and expected to re-establish natural processes and ecosystems that support hunted species and access will be restored following the AMP. Ecological and social context is resilient because, as M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta did not identi fy hunti ng areas in the Project area but outside the LSA, M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta engagement in hunting is considered not sensitive to disruption from the Project.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 119 Table 6.7-9a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditi onal Purposes and Indigenous Physi cal and Cultural Heritage for the M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Trapping 1.Trapped species and habitat: The Project will have temporary effects on land access for traditional resource use and on the distribution and abundance of species trapped for traditional purposes. Species preferring recently disturbed and young habitats are expected to return first, followed by species preferring increasingly older habitat types with reclamation. Canada Lynx: There is a loss of lynx habitat in the WLSA. The loss of effective habitat, along with sensory disturbances associated with the Project, will likely displace lynx to other more suitable undisturbed habitats located west, north and east of the WLSA. Canada lynx rarely use the area around the access road, so it is not expected to have significant effects on lynx movement. American Marten: There will be a temporary , long- term loss of habitat for American marten. Reclamation of disturbed areas will occur throughout and after the life of the Project; however, American martens prefer mature to o ld- growth coniferous forests, which will take many decades to become re-es tablished. East- west movements of American marten will likely be affects by the Project footprint since they tend to avoid open landscapes. The access road and coal conveyor will also likely affect marten movements. North -south marten movements along Bl airmore and Gold Creeks should be relatively unaffected by Project development. With mitigation, Project effects on American marten habitat availability and movement in the WLSA are expected to be local in extent, extended in duration, continuous in frequency, reversible in the long -term, moderate in magnitude for habitat availability and low for movement (EIA, CR#9, Section 5.3.6.1, CIAR #42). Wildlife Residual Effects (EIA, CR#9, Table 5.3-26, CIAR #42): Effects on habitat availability for trapped species (lynx, American marten) due to vegetation clearing and sensory disturbance (due to increased noise, odour, visual disturbance) are moderate magnitude, negative Project contribution, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife movement for trapped species (lynx, American marten) due to construction and operation are low magnitude, and reversible in the long -term. Effects on wildlife abundance for trapped species (lynx, American marten) in hunting locations due to is low magnitude, negative Project contribution and, for American marten, reversible in the long- term and for the Canada lynx, reversible in the short term . Effects on wildlife mortality risk for trapped species (lynx, American marten) due to construction activities, vehicle collis ions, and human- wildlife conflicts are low magnitude, frequency is occasional, and reversible in the short term. 2.Use or access to trapping locations and harvesting methods: Where Project construction and operations activities overlap with hunting and trapping locations, access to active mining areas may be limited until they are reclaimed and safe. Indigenous groups will continue to have access to hunting and trapping locations where safety is not compromised (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.1.1. 2, CIAR #89). The Project's access restrictions within the mine permit area may also affect Indigenous groups' ability to use their preferred harvesting methods and seasonal rounds by alterin g the times of year that Indigenous groups have access to areas of interest for hunting/trapping within the mine permit area (Adden dum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89). Loss or disruption of traplines or trails used for trapping and loss of access to trapping locations due to the mine site and road closure during construction and operation. The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as low magnitude Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of locations and the experience of hunting within the vicinity of the Project (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.1.1.2, CIAR #89); residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42): The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified trapped species and habitat, change use or access to identified trapping locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects o n trapping for M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta due to reduction or loss of trapping opportunities and the change in trapping methods could affect the cultural and spiritual relationship between the Nation and their territory, which is addressed below. Residual effects on trapping are characterized as: Magnitude is low because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to trap in the Project area but it will not affect the ability to trap in the RSA. The M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta did not identify active trapping within the LSA (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1- 1, Section 13.2.1.2, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long-term duration access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency because loss of trapping opportunities will be continuousthroughout construction and operation. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation is planned and expectedto re-establish natural processes and ecosystems that support trapped species and access will be restored following the AMP. Ecological and social context is resilient because, as M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta did not identify trapping areas in the Project area but outside the LSA, M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta engagement in trapping is considered not sensitive to disruption from the Project.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 120 Table 6.7-9a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditi onal Purposes and Indigenous Physi cal and Cultural Heritage for the M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Fishing 1.Fishing species and habitat: Westslope Cutthroat Trout (WSCT) The physical footprint of surface water management infrastructure and open pits will cause permanent change to WSCT habitat. The loss of riparian and aquatic habitat will be reversed by gains achieved through implementing an Offsetting Plan approved by DFO. The magnitude of this effect will be moderate, the duration is long, the frequency will be continuous, however, reversibility is characterized as reversible in the long - term. (Addendum 1, CR#6, Section 4.5, CIAR #44). Changes in hydrology will cause alteration in WSCT aquatic habitat of Gold and Blairmore creeks. The alteration of habitat will be offset by gains achieved through implementing an Offsetting Plan approved by DFO. The magnitude of residual adverse effects will be moderate, the duration is extended, the frequency will be continuous, however, reversibility is characterized as reversible in the long -term. (Addendum 1, CR#6, Section 4.5, CIAR #44). 2.Use or access to fishing locations and harvesting methods: Current access to the portions of the watercourses adjacent to Grassy Mountain is located on Benga private land. During construction and operation phases of the mine, this road will be closed to the general public, and alternate routes will need to be used to access and fish those portions of Blairmore and Gold Creeks (Addendum 8, Appendix A- 1, Section 15.2.2.1.2, CIAR #89) which will be managed via the AMP. Loss or disruption of trails for accessing fishing locations due to the mine site and road closure during construction and operation. The residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as low magnitude Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for e missions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of fishing locations by Indigenous Nations and preferred harvesting method. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1 CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to identified fishing locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on fishing for M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta due to reduction in fishing opportunities, engagement in fishing, and fishing success during construction and operation due to loss of access to fishing locations and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on fishing are characterized as: Magnitude is low because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to fish in the Project area but it will not affect the ability to fish in the RSA. The M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta have advised that they have a fishing interest in the Project area and identifiedspecies, including Westslope Cutthroat trout CIAR #251). The M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta raised concern about the restricted access of the area around the Project site, which limits their ability to practice traditional land use such as fishing. However, they believe this may be alleviated by entering into a M\u00e9tis Access Agreement with Riversdale (Addendum 10, JRP IR- 4.6, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration access restrictions will apply beyond the life of the mine in some areas that may affect access to fishing locations. Continuous frequency because loss of fishing opportunities will be continuousthroughout construction and operation. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation and offsetting is planned and expected maintain fish populations and access will be restored following the AMP. Ecological and social context is resilient because, as M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta did not identify fishing areas in the Project area for which access would be affected by the Project, M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta engagement in fishing is considered not sensitive to disruption from the Project. Plant Gathering 1. Plant species and habitat: The Project will result in loss of traditional use of vegetation within the vegetation local study area. Residual effects to TEK vegetation are local, long -term in duration, continuous, reversible and high magnitude. The Project will have a neutral contribution with respect to valued species and communities. After reclamation, the reclaimed land will support a range of communities with equivalent capabilities to those of the surrounding lands and that existing prior to Project development. Residual adverse effects on vegetation were assessed as high magnitude for rare plants, community diversity, and TEK species, low magnitude for forest, and moderate for wetlands (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). Duration of effects on vegetation will be extended. Reclaimed land will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports traditional use plants (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.1, CIAR #42). Frequency of effects on vegetation, including rare plants and rare plant communities and traditional ecological knowledge, will be continuous through the operational phase of the project and cease only after reclamation is completed (EIA, CR#8, S ection 4.0, CIAR #42). Effects on vegetation are reversible in the long -term with the implementation of progressive reclamation (EIA, CR#8, Section 4.0, CIAR #42). 2.Use or access to plant gathering locations and harvesting methods: Loss or disruption of t rails, loss of access to plant gathering locations, and loss of and preferred methods for plant gathering due to the mine site and access road. Residual effects on trails and travelways was assessed as low magnitude. Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation could affect use of plant gathering locations by Indigenous Nations and preferred harvesting method. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA within 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3 CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change identified plant gathering species and habitat, change use or access to identified harvesting locations, and change preferred harvesting methods. There will be residual effects on plant gathering for M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta due to reduction in harvesting opportunities, engagement in plant gathering, and harvesting success during construction and operation due to loss of access to plant gathering locations and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effects on plant gathering are characterized as: Magnitude is low because there is predicted to be a change in the ability to gather plants in the Project area but it will not affect the ability in the RSA. Although the M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta identified an interest in gathering plants and berries for medicinal and consumption purposes in the Project footprint and identified that there are ecosystems that support medicinal plants existing within the Project area (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 13.3.1.6, CIAR #251), they did identify plant gathering locations (EIA, CR#8, CIAR #42). The M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta provided recom mendations during construction that would protect plant populations; these measures could minimize effects on plant gathering (, Addend um 10, JRP IR -4.6 CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency due to continuous m ine disturbance (loss of vegetation, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Reversibility is characterized as reversible because reclamation (of terrain, soil, vegetation) is planned and expected to re- establish natural processes and ecosystems that support traditional use plants (high density planting of disease- resistant whitebark pine seedlings will contribute to the successful re- establishment of the native ecosystem); and, access to plant gathering locations will be re -established after mine closure. Ecological and social context is resilient because, as M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta did not identify sites used for plant gathering in the Project area but outside the LSA, M\u00e9tisNation of Alberta engagement in plant gathering is considered not sensitive to disruption from the Project.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 121 Table 6.7-9a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditi onal Purposes and Indigenous Physi cal and Cultural Heritage for the M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Trails and Travelways 1.Use or access to trails and travelways: Loss or disruption of trails and travelways due to the mine site and access road. The Project will have residual adverse effects on use of trails and travelways because the Project could result in loss of trails and travelways that are fully or partially within the mine permit boundary. The Project footprint will be reclaimed to land use capability equivalent to pre- mining; however, it will not be accessible for use as trails and travelways during construction and operations. Access to areas around the Project will be possible using existing trails from Highway 40 to reach the area west of Blairmore Creek and Crown Land north of the Project and from either the north or the south along the Gold Creek. With the implementation of the AMP, potential residual effects will be further reduced as Benga will be providing access to adjacent privately owned Benga lands for traditional practices (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 13.3.3.5, CIAR #251). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Increased noise, odour, and visual disturbance during constructi on and operation could affect use of trails and travelways by Indigenous Nations. The noise modelling results indicate that the Project noise levels during the day -time, with the addition of the Ambient Sound Levels (ASLs), will be greater than 35 dBA with in 1,500 m of the Project footprint including areas that could be used by Indigenous groups during construction and operation (EIA, CR#2, Figures 3, 5, and 7, CIAR #42); however, noise levels will be below the PSLs for all residential and theoretical 1,500 m receptors (EIA, CR#2, Section 5.1, CIAR #42). Odour (mostly NO 2) is predicted to be detectable, localized in exceedances, and was assessed as high magnitude; however, the Project does not change the frequency of detectable odours from NO 2 in the community (EIA, CR#1, Section 6.3, CIAR #42). Particulate deposition was assessed as moderate magnitude and continuous but localized and reversible in the short- term (EIA, CR#1, Table 6.5-1, CIAR #42). 2.Features associated with trails and travelways: Loss or disturbance to features associated with trails and travelways due to the mine site and access road. Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude after reclamation (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lightin g, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to within the zone of influence (generally 1.5 km) for noise, visual disturbance, and effect on access (E IA, CR#2, CIAR #42). The geographic extent of residual effects on historical resources and on land and resource use is characterized as local (EIA , CR#10, Section E, CIAR #42). The frequency of impact on access and utilities in the lands and resource use is continuous (EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). The frequency of impact of noise and other disturbances to trail use will continue throughout the Project lifespan (EIA, CR#2, CIAR #42). In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access and change preferred trails and travelways. There will be residual effects on trails and travelways for M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta due to restriction in use or access, and engagement with features associated with trails and travelways during construction and operation due to loss of access of trails and travelways locations, sensory disturbance, and change in use within the mine permit area. Residual effects on trails and travelways is characterized as: Magnitude is low because, although there is predicted to be a change in trails and travelways in the Project area, the M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta did not identify any trails or travelways or features associated with navigation within the Project LSA and(Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 13.3.1.5, CIAR #251). The M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta raised concern about the restricted access of the area around the Project site, which limits their ability to practice traditional land use. However, they believe thismay be alleviated by entering into a M\u00e9tis Access Riversdale (Addendum 10, JRP IR -4.6, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long-term duration because reclamation will require time to return the ecosystem to a condition that supports wildlife habitat and access restrictions will apply beyond life of mine in some areas. Continuous frequency during due to continuous mine disturbance (loss of vegetation, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Reversible effects in trails and travelways as the M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta did not identify any trails or travelways in and around the Project site. Ecological and social context is resilient because, as M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta did not identify trails and travelways in the Project area and important cultural areas for M\u00e9tisNation of Alberta are outside the LSA and accessible outside the Project area, M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta trails and travelways is considered not sensitive to disruption from the Project. However, the M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta noted that access to Crown Lands beyond the project area as a major concern, historically, and members have been permitted to use trails and u ndeveloped roadways to access areas north of the proposed mine. The M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta further noted that Benga has restricted access to the roads leading to areas such as Daisy Creek which has resulted in a greatly extended travel time to reach areas for traditional use as land users must go around the project area (Addendum 10, JRP IR -4.6, Ta ble 4.6-13, CIAR #251). Cultural and Spiritual Values 1.Use and access to sacred important sites with cultural or spiritual value: Residual adverse effects on access and utilities in the Lands and Resource Use VC was assessed as nil magnitude (EIA, CR#10, CIAR #42). Loss or disruption of trails to important sites due to the mine site and access road. Loss of hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering opportunities. The residual effects, as seen above, on hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering were assessed as low magnitude. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation, which could affect use and enjoyment of culturally and spiritually important sites. Increased noise levels extend 1.5 km from the Project (EIA, CR#2, CIAR#42). Residual adverse effects on air quality was assessed as high magnitude for odour, low magnitude for lighting, and low to moderate magnitude for emissions including dust (EIA, CR#1, CIAR #42). Residual adverse effects on historical resources was assessed as low (EIA, Section E, CIAR #42). 2.Experience of engaging with sites of cultural or spiritual value: Loss or disturbance to important sites due to the mine site and access road. Loss of experience in hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering, which could affect the cultural and spiritual relationships with the resource. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation, which could affect enjoyment or experience of using culturally and spiritually important sites. 3.Cultural values associated with sites/features: Loss of hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering opportunities, which could affect intergenerational teaching of traditional practices, and result in loss of cultural identity, sense of place, and human health/well- being. Loss of access to sites/features due to construction and operation activities. Loss of or damage to unique sites and special features as a result of clearing and construction activities. Increase in noise, odour, and visual disturbance during construction and operation, which could affect enjoyment or experience of engaging with the sites/features of cultural or spiritual value. In summary, effects on linked VCs will act synergistically to change use or access to sites with cultural or spiritual value, change the experience of using these sites, and change the cultural value associated with sites and features. There will be residual effects on cultural and spiritual values for M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta during constructio n and operation due to loss of access to culturally or spiritually important sites and sensory disturbance within the mine permit area. Residual effect on cultural and spiritual values is characterized as: Magnitude is low because although there is p redicted to be a change in use, access, and experience of engaging with sites of cultural and spiritual values in the Project area, this does not affect use, access, and experience of engaging with sites of cultural andspiritual values in the RSA. The M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta raised concern about the restricted access of the area around the Project site, which limits their ability to practice traditional land use. However, they believe this may be alleviated by entering into a M\u00e9tis Access Agreement with Rivers dale (Addendum 10, JRP IR -4.6, CIAR #251). Local geographic extent because residual effects will extend beyond the mine footprint but limited to the LSA. Long- term duration because the loss of experience in hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gath ering could affect the long -term cultural and spiritual relationships between Indigenous groups and their resources and territory. Change in land use and access will extend beyond the Project lifespan. Continuous frequency during due to continuous mine disturbance (loss of vegetation, access restrictions, noise, visual) throughout life of mine. Non- reversible because loss of cultural and spiritual sites and experience in engaging in land use could result in loss of the knowledge of cultural and spiritual v alues. Ecological and social context is resilient because, as M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta did not identify cultural and spiritual values in the Project area and important cultural areas for M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta are outside the LSA, M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta cultural and spiritual values is considered not sensitive to disruption from the Project.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 122 Table 6.7-9a Description and Characterization of Residual Project Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditi onal Purposes and Indigenous Physi cal and Cultural Heritage for the M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta Indigenous VC Description of Residual Project Effects Characterization of Residual Project Effects on the Indigenous VC Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage Physical and cultural heritage sites are located throughout Region 3 (AMHS, 2015) which are located outside of the Project RSA (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 13.4.1, CIAR #251). The Project will not intersect or be in proximity to any sacred, gathering and habitation sites identified by the M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta. Physical and cultural heritage sites are not in pr oxim ity to the Project and are located outside of the Project RSA As a result, the Project is not expected to have a residual effect on physical or cultural heritage of the M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta Region 3 (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 13.4.2, CIAR #251). The Project will not intersect or be in proximity to any sacred, gathering and habitation sites identified by the M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta. Physical and cultural heritage sites are not in proximity to the Project and are located outside of the Project R SA. As a result, the Project is not expected to have a residual effect on physical or cultural heritage of the M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta Region 3. Physical and cultural heritage is not assessed further (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 13.4.2, CIAR #251).

Tenth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment, Appendix 4.1-1. (CIAR #251). Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency interim Technical Guidance \"Assessing Cumulative Environmental Effects under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 \". (March 2018). Addendum 8, Section 15 (CEAR #89) and Appendix 4.1-1 (CIAR #251) contain Benga's cumulative effects assessment with respect to the current use of lands and resources for traditional purposes and the cultural and physical heritage of Indigenous peoples. Benga noted in Appendix 4-1.1 that cumulative effects from development, change in land use, settlement, access and cli mate change have already resulted in significant adverse effects on hunting and trapping since European settlement. However, Benga did not elaborate on the Project's specific incremental contributions to the above named BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 125 pathways ( e.g. land use, access, climate change) of cumulative effects and determined that cumulative effects on hunting and trapping were not significant. In addition, the cumulative effects assessment relied on the consideration of residual effects to biophysical (associated) VCs but did not directly assess effects to Indigenous VCs, including intangible components such as consideration of expe rience, culture, governance, knowledge and other factors. For example, Benga states: \"The cumulative effects on associated VCs (wildlife and wildlife habitat, land and resource use) are not significant. Based on this and the characterization of residual cumulative effects on hunting and trapping, the cumulative effects on hunting and trapping are not significant.\" The Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency's interim Technical Guidance for \"Assessing Cumulative Environmental Effects under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012\"4states that the first step to carrying out a cumulative effects assessment is to identify the VCs for which residual environmental effects are predicted after the consideration of mitigation measures. The EIS Guidelines (CIAR #11) require Benga to identify and provide a rationale for the selection of VCs that will constitute the focus of the cumulative effects assessment. The Guidelines also require that residual effects, even if very small or deemed insignificant, must be described. This should be done in sufficient detail to enable the Panel to review Benga's analysis of the cumulative effects, based on these residual effects. Further information on the cumulative effects resulting from the incremental contribution of the Project's residual effects on the environment and Indigenous peoples, is required to support the Panel's mandate under CEAA 2012. a) Describe how the Project's residual effects contribute, in a cumulative manner, to existing effects from other activities and in combination with other physical activities will be carried out. b) Update the cumulative effects assessment with respect to the current use of lands and resources for traditional purposes and the cultural and physical heritage of Indigenous peoples using the descriptions of the residual effects above. Use the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency's interim Technical Guidance for \"Assessing Cum ulative Environmental Effects under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012\" to guide the cumulative effects assessment. Response: The cumu lative effects assessment (CEA) results presented here are consistent with those presented previously in Sect ion 18: Cumulative Effects in An Updated Assessment of the Potential Effect of the Grassy Mountain Project on Indigenous Groups (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, CIAR#251) and the updated CEA (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15, 4 Available online: Interim Technical Guidance \"Assessing Cumulative Environmental Effects under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, \". https://www.canada.ca/en/impact-assessment- agency/services/policy- guidance/assessing -cumulative -environmental Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 126 CIAR#89). The cumulative eff ects results are also consistent with the process outlined in Assessing Cumulative Environmental Effects under CEAA 2012, Interim Technical Guidance (March 2018). The first step for this current analysis is to identify the Valued Components ( VCs) for which residual environmental effects are predicted after consideration of mitigation measures. The residual effects on Indigenous VCs are descr ibed in the response to JRP IR -6.7 and do not differ from those predicted in Appendix 4.1-1 (Addendum 10, CIAR#251). Residual effects were predicted for: Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes: hunting and trapping; fishing ; plant gathering; trails and travelways ; and cultural and spiritual values . Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage . These residual effects were carried forward into the CEA. Residual effects on related biophysical VCs were also considered in the CEA; however, they were not the only factors considered. Other factors considered included extensive consultation with Indigenous groups, intangible (spiritual and cultural) considerations, and findings from Traditional Land Use (TLU) studies, all of which helped support the CEA as presented below in Table 6.8-1. As requested, a summary of the Project's contribution to cumulative effects on Indigenous groups VC's and its interaction with past, present, and future projects are presented in Table 6.8-1 for Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes and in Table 6.8-2 for Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage. The tables also include the mitigation measures proposed to address cumulative effects and the characterization of the residual cumulative effects. The extensive background information that supports these tables was provided in Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18, CIAR#251. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 127 Table 6.8-1 Summary of Residual Cumulative Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes Residual Effects on Indigenous VCs Carried Forward to the Project's Cumulative Effects Assessment Summary of Past and Present Development Activities that have Affected Indigenous VCs (from Addendum Co ntribution to Cumulative Effects Interaction with Past, Present, and Future Development Activities Mitigation Measures to Address Cumu lative Effects Residual Cumulative Effects Hunting and Trapping (residual effects on hunting are described in Tables 6.7-2 through 6.7-9): 1) Change in i dentified hunted / trapped species and habitats. 2) Change in use or access to identified hunting loc ations, traplines and trappinglocations. 3)Change in preferred harvesting method.Past and present development since European settlement within the RSA has resulted in loss of natural land cover and altered land use, which have reduced wildlife abundance and habitat effectiveness, increased hunting pressure, and restricted access to lan d for traditional purposes. According to the Siksika Nation and K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation cumulative effects study (Carlson et al. 2018a,b), this has placed hunting and trapping alrea dy at moderate to high risk and according to the Ktunaxa Nation, current use of the RSA for trapping has been impeded since coal mining began in the 1900s (Appendix 10, JRP IR-4.6, CIAR#251). Some Indigenous groups do not hunt in close proximity (e.g., 500 m) to industrial sites, settlements, rural residence and other features used for non-traditional use purposes due to concerns regarding contamination, safety, and the overall negative experience on the land (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 4.3.1.1, CIAR #251). Some Indigenous groups have indicated that they do not hunt in parks or ecological reserves, so these areas in the RSA are considered inaccessible for traditional land use (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 4.3.1.3, CIAR#251). The Ktunaxa Nati on identified that the viability of the Project area is especially important as it is located in the only area in amakis Ktunaxa where Ktunaxa citizens can practice hunting rights on both sides of the Rockies without interruption and interference from National Park restrictions (Appendix 10, JRP IR-4.6, CIAR#251). After the implementation of project -specific mitigation measures, there will be a residual project effect on hunting and trapping of low to moderate magnitude because the Project will result in loss of access to hunting/trapping areas and reduced quality of experience. This could affect Indigenous cultural and spiritual values such as Indigenous relationship with wildlife and engaging in traditional practices. The overall Project contribution to cumulative effects on hunting and trapping is deemed low because: the Project footprint overlaps historic disturbances(unreclaimed, legacy mine site that overlaps one thirdof the Project area); existing (non-Benga related) disturbances already limitaccess to hunting and trapping; the Project's Conservation and Reclamation Plan willintegrate traditional land use opportunities; the Project footprint will be progressively reclaimed to improve land use capability for traditional purposes by reclaiming previously disturbed legacy mine areas; Benga has committed to return Crown leases to theCrown after reclamation is completed; the Project's Access Management Plan (AMP) will improve hunting and trapping opportunities after mine closure (following 23 years of mine operations), by allowing affected Indigenous groups access to non-operational areas of Benga owned and crown land being used for the project; in the continuous development and improvement of the AMP, Benga will continue to consult with Indigenous groups to identify alternative areas for hunting and trapping. The AMP is intended to limit access to authorized persons, and facilitate access to traditionaluse areas for Indigenous groups; and Benga will continue to work with Indigenous groups toidentify species of importance prior to construction activities.The Project will interact with past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future development in the Crowsnest Pass. The Project footprint overlaps historic disturbances such as mining, rail, roads, and altered land use that have already resulted in adverse effects on hunting and trapping. Future development includes mining, logging, highway re -alignment, transmission, agriculture, urban development (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.2, CIAR#251). Other foreseeable future projects such as forestry and other mining projects have the potential to act cumulatively with the Project by incrementally reducing the number of wildlife harvesting sites (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1 1, Section 18.4.1.1.3, CIAR#251 Based on K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation and Siksika Nation cumulative effects assessment (Carlson et al. 2018a,b), hunting opportunities will decline by 10% for elk and by 2% for land access in the next 50 years. Potential impacts to hunting and trapping have been mitigated at the Project level and are described in Table 6.5-2 (JRP IR-6.5). Benga is committed to implementing measures to reduce cumulative effects on hunting and trapping on a regional scale through the following: minimize the overall disturbance footprint through the mine planning process(Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251); incorporate the existing legacy mining disturbances into the development and reclamation plans for the Project (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251); engage with the Indigenous communities during construction, operations andreclamation, including review and input into management and monitoring plans, discussion of options to facilitate access for traditional activities,construction timing and reclamation (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251); Benga will support an Indigenous Environmental Stewardship Co mmittee, one of whose functions will be to provide advice on environmental stewardshipand land use values as they arise (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251); implement an Indigenous -led monitoring program, over the life of the Project, which will inclu de, but not be limited to, monitoring for culturally valued resources and monitoring of reclamation success (Addendum 10, JRP IR-4.3, CIAR#251); Benga will consider allowing access to Benga -owned lands outside the Project footprint within the RSA for traditional use such as hunting and trapping. Benga will work with the Nations to identify key areas and develop an Access Management Plan for traditional use (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.1. 1.5, CIAR#251); and continue to improve the Access Manag ement Plan for construction and operation phases of the Project that includes notification of access restrictions during construction as required for safety purposes to allow for planning alternate hu nting locations and to reduce effects to wildlife (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251).With the implementation of Project-specific mitigation measures and measures to address cumulative effects, residual cumulative effects on hunting and trapping are characterized as (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.1.1.6, CIAR#251): Low magnitude because the Project footprint overlaps existing disturbance and contributions of the Project and future development to cumulative effects are predicted to be less than 10% further reduction in the next 50 years (Carlson et al. 2018). Regional geographic extent because cumulative effects are occurring over the traditional territories used by Indigenous groups. Medium-term because with reclamation the Project footprint is expected to improve hunting and trapping opportunities following mine closure. Continuous frequency because cumulative loss of hunting and trapping opportunities will be continuous until reclamation improves conditions. Reversible because implementation of the AMP, Conservation and Reclamation Plan (C&R Plan), Wildlife Mitigation and Monitoring Plan (WMMP), and regional efforts will improve conditions for traditional land use such as hunting and trapping. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 128 Table 6.8-1 Summary of Residual Cumulative Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes Residual Effects on Indigenous VCs Carried Forward to the Project's Cumulative Effects Assessment Summary of Past and Present Development Activities that have Affected Indigenous VCs (from Addendum Co ntribution to Cumulative Effects Interaction with Past, Present, and Future Development Activities Mitigation Measures to Address Cumu lative Effects Residual Cumulative Effects Fishing (residual effects on fishing are described in Tables 6.7 -2 to 6.7-9): 1) Change in identifiedspecies and habitat. 2) Change in use oraccess to identified fishing locations. 3) Change in preferred harvesting method.Use and access to fishing locations and preferred harvesting methods have already been altered due to the creation of parks and protect ed areas, private land, land use regulations and restrictions, rail and road corridors, agriculture, and settlements. Some Indigenous groups indicated they do not fish in close proximity to well sites (approximately 500 m), or near industrial sites, settle ments, rural residence and other features used for non-traditional use purposes due to concerns regarding contamination, safety and the overall negative experience on the land (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.3.1, CIAR#251). The K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation also indicated that they do not fish in parks or ecological reserves, so these areas have already been deemed inaccessible for traditional land use (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 4.3.1.3, CIAR#251). Residual Project effects on fishing are considered low to moderate magnitude, depending on the Indigenous group, but reversible post -mine closure. The Project will contribute to cumulative effects on fishi ng, specifically use of and access to fishing locations because access to portions of watercourses are on Benga private land and Benga will implement road closures to general public for safety reasons (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.1.2.3, CIAR#251). The Project's contribution to cumulative effects on fishing is low because: existing disturbances already restrict access to fishing; the Access Management Plan includes notifying aboutaccess restrictions to allow for planning alternatefishing locations and access routes; reclamation and access management plans will improvefishing opportunities after mine closure because affected Indigenous groups will be granted access to non-operational areas of Benga land and crown land being used for the Project. The AMP will control access to authorized persons, will ban fishing by employees, and facilitate access to traditional use areas for Indigenous groups, where feasible; Benga will continue to consult with Indigenous groupson the further development of the Conservation andReclamation plans to ensure that fishing is considered as the site is reclaimed; design and implementation of a Fisheries Offsetting Plan early in the Project development will offset permanent loss of fish habitat; Benga has committed to return Crown leases to theCrown after reclamation is completed; the fisheries offset plan will be di scussed with Indigenous groups as it is being developed and before itis finalized; Benga will put in place a program to monitor fish health and to check for selenium in the fish populations andwater; and groundwater monitoring wells will be used to ensurethat the ground water quantity and quality meetexpectations.The Project will interact with other projects in the Crowsnest Pass (e.g., nearby farming and sewage, forest cover loss, mining and roads, and future development such as mining and highway rea lignment) that affect fishing (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.1.2.2, CIAR#251). Specifically, loss of and reduced suitability of fish habitat (aquatic and/or riparian, water quality), loss of access to fishing locations due to cumulative access restrictions, and reduced engagement in fishing due to cumulative noise, visual disturba nces, and concerns regarding perceived contamination of fish. Potential impacts to fishing have been mitigated at the Project level and are described in Table 6.5-3 (JRP IR-6.5). Benga is committed to implementing measures to reduce cumulative effects on fishing on a regional scale through the following: maintain a 100 m undisturbed forested buffer around Blairmore and Gold Creeks (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251); Benga will support an Indigenous Environmental Stewardship Committee, one of whose functions will be to provide advice on environmental stewardship and land use values as they arise (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251); implement an Indigenous -led mo nitoring program, over the life of the Project, which will include, but not be limited to, monitoring for culturally valued resources and monitoring of reclamation success (Addendum 10, JRP IR-4.3, CIAR#251); implement a Fishe ries Offsetting Plan and Offsetting Effectiveness Monitoring Plan that more than offset the habitat losses caused by the Project related to Gold Creek and Blairmore Creek (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2: Fishing, CIAR#251); Benga has committed to developing an Indigenous monitoring progra m in cooperation with nearby First Nations to work in parallel with other westernscience-based monitoring programs. In addition, Benga will consult with Indigenous groups in developing all of the monitoring programs through a series of workshops. Benga has committed to providing Annual Reportingdocuments to Indigenous groups highlighting the results from the monitoring programs and seeking any input that would help Benga improve monitoring and the effectiveness of mitigation measures (Addendum 10, Appendix 5.4-1, Section 4.0, CIAR#251); continue to improve the Access Management Plan for construction and operation phases of the Project that includes notification of access restrictionsduring construction as required for safety purposes to allow for planni ng alternate fishing locations and access routes (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251); Benga will consider allowing access to Benga -owned lands outside the Project footprint within the RSA for traditional use such as fishing (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.1.2.4, CIAR#251); conduct ongoing consultation with Indigenous communities duringconstruction, operations and reclamation, including review and input into management plans, discussion of options to facilitate access for traditional activiti es, construction timing, and reclamation (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251); and engage with Indigenous groups prior to and during mine construction to allowfor opportunities for species of interest to be harvested, re -located or otherwise utilized (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, Section 15.2.2.2, CIAR #89).After implementation of project -specific mitigation measures and mitigations to address cumulative effects, and assuming future projects occur as planned, the residual cumulative effects on fishing are primarily due to future development interaction with past and present development. The residual cumulative effects on fishing are characterized as (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.1.2.5, CIAR#251): Low magnitude be cause Benga will offset Projec t effects on fish and fish habitat in an Offsetting Plan and will provide access to fishing locations for affected Indigenous groups. Regional geographic extent because cumulative effects are occurring within watersheds in Indigenous groups' traditional territories. Medium-term because, with reclamation, AMP, and Offsetting Plan, residual cumulative effects are expected to last for the duration of the Project. Continuous frequency because cumulative loss of fishing opportunitie s will be continuous during construction and operation. Reversible because implementation of the AMP, C&R Plan, Fisheries Offsetting Plan, and regional efforts will improve conditions for traditional land use such as fishing. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 129 Table 6.8-1 Summary of Residual Cumulative Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes Residual Effects on Indigenous VCs Carried Forward to the Project's Cumulative Effects Assessment Summary of Past and Present Development Activities that have Affected Indigenous VCs (from Addendum Co ntribution to Cumulative Effects Interaction with Past, Present, and Future Development Activities Mitigation Measures to Address Cumu lative Effects Residual Cumulative Effects Plant Gathering (residual effects on plant gathering are described in Tables 6.7-2 to 6.7 -9): 1) Change in identifiedplant species and ecosystems. 2) Change in use or access to identified plant gathering locations. 3) Change in preferred plant gathering m ethod.Limited information was provided on past and present plant gathering locations and practices in the RSA through consultation with the various Indigenous groups. Although Indigenous groups have not identified site -specific current use in the Project area for plant gathering, Benga acknowledges that this know ledge is typically sacred and not widely shared (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 9.3.1.4, CIAR#251). Based on this, Benga has assumed that the Project will intersect or be in proximity to habitat and species that are identified for plant gathering by Indigenous groups (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 4.3.2.4, CIAR#251), which is supported by the fact Piikani Nation field crew members recorded four harvest sites for plant gathering and hunting that partially or fully overlap the LSA as part of a T LU study (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 5.3.1.4, CIAR#251). Past development has likely resulted in cumulative adverse effects on plant gathering due to past and present change in land use a nd air quality since European settlement (Addendum 10, Appe ndix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.1.3.1, CIAR#251). Residual Project effects on plant gathering are considered low to moderate magnitude, depending on the Indigenous group, but reversible post -mine closure. The Project will contribute to cumulative effects on plan t gathering, specifically loss of available traditional use plants, use of and access to gathering locations, and decline in engagement in plant gathering. The Project's contribution to cumulative effects on plant gathering is low because: existing disturbances already restrict access; reclamation will improve plant gathering opportunitiesafter mine closure; the AMP will include notification to allow for planning alternate plant gathering locations; Benga will allow Indigenous groups to access Benga privat e land for the purposes of limited timber harvesting and gathering of plants; Benga will work with Indigenous groups to identify other mitigations regarding traditional and medicinal plant s; Benga will work with the Indigenous groups to identifykey areas and develop an AMP for traditional use such as plant gathering (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.1.3.2, CIAR#251); and Benga will consult with Indigenous groups on the C&R Plan an d vegetation management program. The C&R Plan will include the plan ting of native species and support revegetation of traditional use species and end land use decisions made in consultation with Indigenous groups. Traditional land use opportunities will be integrated.The Project will interact with other past, present, and future physical activities that affect plant gathering in the region. This includes development (e.g., mining) that directly disturbs ecosystems that support traditional use plants and projects that result in loss of access to and use of plant gathering locations. Potential impacts to plant gathering have been mitigated at the Project level and are described in Table 6.5-4 (JRP IR-6.5). Benga is committed to implementing measures to re duce cumulative effects on plant gathering on a regional scale through the following: implement a re -vegetation program which will target the re -establishment of vegetation communities, such as closed conifer forests, mature mixed forests, native upland herbaceous grasslands and treed swamps, common to the pre - disturbed la ndscape that will support valued vegetation (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251); support an Indigenous Environmental Stewardship Committee, one of whosefunctions will be to provide advice on environmental stewardship and land use as they arise (Addend um 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251); implement an Indigenous -led monitoring program, over the life of the Project, which will include, but not be limited to, monitoring for culturally valued resources and monitoring of reclamation success (Addendum 10, JRP IR-4.3, CIAR#251); support an Indigenous monitoring program which will include monitoring of asuite of culturally defined environmental attributes (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2: Plant Gathering, CIAR#251); continue to improve the Access Management Plan for construction and operation phases of the Project that includes notification of access restrictions during construction as required for safety purposes to allow for planning alternate plant gathering locations (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251); provide access to Benga private land outside of the Project for Indigenous harvesting of lodgepole pine and other culturally important plants (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251).After implementation of the project -specific mitigations and mitigation measures to address cumu lative effects, and assuming future projects occur as planned, the residual cumulative effects on plant gathering are primarily due to future development interaction with past and present development. Residual cumulative effects are characterized as (Adde ndum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.1.3.3, CIAR#251): Low magnitude because the Project footprint overlaps existing disturbance and contributions of the Project and future development to cumulative effects are predicted to be less than 10% further reduct ion in the next 50 years (Carlson et al. 2018). Regional geographic extent because cumulative effects are occurring over the traditional territories used by Indigenous groups. Medium-term because with reclamation the Project footprint is expected to improve plant gathering opportunities following mine closure. Continuous frequency because cumulative loss of plant gathering opportunities will be continuous until reclamation improves conditions. Reversible because implementation of the AMP, C& R Plan, and regional efforts will improve conditions for traditional land use such as plant gathering.

Traditional trails and tra velways a nd their use have likely been affected by past and present land use (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.1.4.1, CIAR#251) due to private land, land use regulations and restrictions, rail and road corridors, agriculture, and settlements. Tra vel and a ccess to the Crowsnest Pass by the Tsuut'ina Nation members has diminished since contact with Euro-Canadian settlers. While the Nation continues to use hunting trails throughout the Grassy Mountain area, this is done less than in the past (Addendum 10, Ap pendix 4.1-1, Section 8.3.1.5, CIAR#251). Residual Project effects on trails and travelways are considered moderate magnitude and irreversible for Indigenous groups who maintain traditional trails and travelways in the area (see response to JRP IR-6.7 ). The Project's contribution to cumulative effects on trails and travelways is low because: existing disturbances already restrict access; Benga will work with affected Indigenous groups to develop the AMP to plan alternative travel routes or allow Indigenous groups to access Benga private land for traditional purposes such as traveling to sacred andceremonial sites; and Benga has committed to re turn Crown leases to the Crown after reclamation is completed.The Project will interact with other past, present, and future physical activities that affect trails and travelways in the region, such as cumulative increase in private land (agriculture, res idential, mining operations) that restricts access and landscape connectivity for traditional purposes. Potential impacts to trails and travelways have been mitigated at the Project level and are described in Table 6.5-5 (JRP IR-6.5). Benga is committed t o implementing measures to reduce cumulative effects on trails and travelways on a regional scale through the following: Benga is working with Indigenous communities to develop an Indigenous Environmental Stewardship Committee, one of whose functions will be to provide advice on environmental stewardship and land use values as they arise(Addendum 10, JRP IR-4.3, CIAR#251); implement an Indigenous -led monitoring program, over the life of the Project, which will include, but not be limited to, monitoring for culturally valued resources and monitoring of reclamation success (Addendum 10, JRP IR-4.3, CIAR#251); will consid er allowing access to Benga -owned lands outside the Project footprint within the RSA for traditional use. Benga will work with the Nationsto identify key areas and develop an Access Management Plan for traditional use (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Sectio n 18.4.1.4.2, CIAR#251); continue to improve the Access Management Plan that will includenotification of access restrictions during construction as required for safety purposes to allow for planning alternate trails and travelways (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1 -2, CIAR#251); share information about construction timing (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251); develop and implement a Cultural Site Discovery Contingency Plan for culturally important sites identified during construction or operations(Addendum 10 , Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251).After implementation of the Project -specific mitigations and mitigation me asures to address cumulative effects, and assuming future projects occur as planned, the residual cumulative effects on trails and travelways are primarily due to future access restrictions and land use interacting with past and present development. Residual cumulative effects are characterized as (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.1.4.3, CIAR#251): Low magnitude because traditional trails and travelways have already been affected by past and existing land use and Benga will allow access on Benga -owned lands within the RSA. Regional geographic extent because cumulative effects are occurring over the traditional territories and between watersheds used by Indigenous groups. Long-term because cumulative loss of access to or use of traditional trails and travelways will occur beyond the life of mine. Continuous frequency because cumulative effects will be continuous until traditional access is restored. Reversible because implementation of the AMP, C&R Plan, and regional access management strategies will improve land use for traditional purposes such as use and maintenance of traditional trails and travelways. ` BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 131 Table 6.8-1 Summary of Residual Cumulative Effects on Current Use of Lands and Resources for Traditional Purposes Residual Effects on Indigenous VCs Carried Forward to the Project's Cumulative Effects Assessment Summary of Past and Present Development Activities that have Affected Indigenous VCs (from Addendum Co ntribution to Cumulative Effects Interaction with Past, Present, and Future Development Activities Mitigation Measures to Address Cumu lative Effects Residual Cumulative Effects Cultural and Spiritual Values (residual effects on cultural and spiritual values are described in Tables 6.7-2 to 6.7 -9): 1) Disturbance to sacredand culturally or spiritually important sites and access to, or use, of those sites. 2) Changes to the experi ence of engaging with sites an d landscape features that have cultural or spiritual value. 3) Changes to the cultural value and importance associated with the engagement with the sites/features of cultural or spiritual value (including inter-generational te aching of traditional practice s).Limited information was received from Indigenous groups regarding the locations of culturally and spiritually significant sites that overlap with the Project footprint; however, K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation identified the area in and around the Project h as important Blackfoot place names and Ktunaxa Nation identified the Project LSA and footprint in the Blairmore and Frank areas as places and teaching areas to pass on Ktunaxa knowledge and history (Addendum CIAR#251). Nonetheless, the Project is in an area with cultural and spiritual significance, where several Indigenous peoples continue to practice their Indigenous and Treaty Rights. Past and existing physical activities have already interfered with Indigenous traditional practices (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.1.5, CIAR#251). Use, access, and changes in experience of sacred, culturally, and/or spiritually important sites and landscape features may have already been altered due to t he creation of rail and road corridors in the area, parks and protected areas, private land, land use regulations and restrictions, agriculture, and settlements (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.2.1, CIAR#251). Residua l Project effects on cultural and spiritual values are considered moderate magnitude and irreversible for Indigenous groups who continue to practice their Indigenous and Treaty rights in the area (see response to JRP IR-6.7). The Project's contribution to cumulative effects on cultural and spiritual values may occur through reduced or loss of access to important sites and indirect effects due to avoidance of areas (i.e., perceived diminished value of wildlife/plants/harvested materials), and conflic t with other land users (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.3.1, CIAR#251). This loss of access means loss of areas that are important for community members to engage in culturally/spiritually important practices and to pass on knowledge and skills to future generations (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.1.5.1, CIAR#251). Indigenous groups have identified that these losses can cause adverse effects on Indigenous individual's psychological health (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.1.5.1, CIAR#251). The Project will interact with other past, present, and future physical activities in the region to further interfere with the ability to pass on culture to the next generation, which could lead to loss of cultural identity (Addendum 10 , Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.1.5.1, CIAR#251). This includes disruption of knowledge transmission to future generations and associated adverse effects on Indigenous health and well -being (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.1.5.1, CIAR#251). Potential impacts to VCs linked to cultural and spiritual values have been mitigated at the Project level and are described in Table 6.5-6 (JRP IR-6.5). Benga is committed to implementing measures to reduce cumulative effects on VCs linked to cul tural and spiritual values on a regional scale through the following: mark or otherwise protected identified sites of cultural and sacred importancewithin 100 m of Project activity and outside the Project footprint prior to land disturbance (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2: Cultural and Spiritual Values, CIAR#251); work with Alberta Culture and Tourism and the Indigenous community to develop and plan for mitigation of identified TK/TU features if avoidance is not possible (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2: Cultural and Spir itual Values, CIAR#251); Benga has and will continue to support local and Indigenous cultural eventsand ceremonies through its Indigenous engagement and initiatives such as its community sponsorship program (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2: Cultural and Spiri tual Values, CIAR#251); support a cultural competency program for its employees and contractors (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2: Cultural and Spiritual Values, CIAR #251); Benga has committed to providing Annual Reporting documents to Indigenous groups highlighting the results from the monitoring programs and seeking anyinput that would help Benga improve monitoring and the effectiveness of mitigation measures. (Addendum 10, WMM P, Section 4.3, CIAR#251); support an Indigenous Environmental Stewardship Committee to provide advice on land use values and sites of cultural, spiritual and traditional importance as they arise (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251); support an Indigenous monitoring program which will include monitoring of asuite of culturally defined environmental attributes, including archaeologicalsites of historical and cultural significance (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251); develop and implement a Cultural Site Discovery Contingency Plan inconsultation with Indigenous communities for culturally important sites discovered during construction or operations (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251); continue to work with Indigenous communities to improve the Access Management Plan to grant access to non-operational areas of Benga land and crown land being used for the Project. The AMP will control access to authorized persons, will ban fishing by employees and facilitate access to traditional use areas for the Indigenous community where feasible. The AMP will include notification of access restrictions during construction required for safety purposes to allow for planning alternate plant gathering locations(Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251); Benga will continue to consult with Indigenous groups on the furtherdevelopment of the Conservation and Reclamation plans to ensure that culturaland spiritual values and other traditional and cultural values are considered as the site is reclaimed. This includes working with Indigenous communities to identify landscape attributes that support traditional practices, uses, and cultural learning (Addendum 10, JRP IR-4.3, CIAR#251); and Benga will allow access to Benga -owned lands outside the Project footprint within the RSA for traditional use (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.1.5.2, CIAR #251).After implementation of the mitigations and assuming future projects occur as planned, residual cumulative effects on cultural and spiritual values are expected. Residual cumulative effects are characterized as (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.1.5.3, CIAR#251): Low magnitude because past and present activities have already interfered with Indigenous traditional practices and experiences, and the Project's contribution will be mitigated through Benga's commitments to suppor ting regional programs to address cumulative effects on cultural and spiritual values. Regional geographic extent because cumulative effects are occurring within the territories of Indigenous groups and could affect cultural identity and community well- being. Long-term because cumulative loss of cultural and spiritual values could affect generations and the long-term commu nity well-being. Continuous frequency because cumulative effects on cultural and spiritual values will be continuous in time and between generations. Non-reversible because cumulative loss of cultural and spiritual sites and experience in engaging in land use could result in permanent loss of the knowledge of cultural and spiritual values. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 132 Table 6.8-2 Summary of Residual Cumulative Effects on Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage Indigenous VCs Summary of Past and Present Development Activities Project's Contribution to Cumulative Effects Interaction with Past, Present, and Future Development Activities Mitigation Measures to Address C umulative Effects Residual Cumulative Effects Indigenous Physical and Cultural Heritage (residual effects are described in Tables 6.7-2 to 6.7 -9): 1) Disturbance to physicaland cultural heritage. 2) Change in access to physical and cultural heritage. 3)Change to cultural value or importance associated with physical and cultural heritage.Limited information was received from Indigenous groups regarding the locations of physical and cultural heritage (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.2.1.2, CIAR#251). K\u00e1\u00ednai Nation identified sites within the Project LSA that are significant for traditional material culture, such as material for knives and arrowheads (Addendum 10, JRP IR-4.6, CIAR#251). Stoney Nakoda Nation reported areas in the Project area tha t are recognized by the members as meditation sites (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 7.4.1, CIAR #251). Tsuut'ina Nation field crew recorded several rock cairns used as a navigational tool situated along historic trails (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 8.4.1, CIAR #251). Physical and cultural heritage sites, and use and access to these sites, have likely already been altered by past and present land use in the area such as development, private land, land use regulations and restrictions, rail and road corridors, agriculture, and settlements. Residual Project effects on Indigenous physical and cultural heritage are considered moderate magnitude and irreversible for Indigenous groups who identified the area contains physical and cultural heritage (s ee response to JRP IR-6.7). Project effects will include disturbance to features associated with sacred, gathering, or habitation sites and change in access to physical and cultural heritage. The Project's contribution to cumulative effects on physical and cultural heritage is low b ecause Benga has the following commitments: Where identified by Indigenous groups, sites of cultural andsacred importance within 100 m of Project activity and outside the Project footprint will be marked or otherwise protectedprior to land disturbance. If avoidance of any TK/TU features is not possible, Benga willwork with Alberta Culture and Tourism and/or Indigenous groups to develop and plan for mitigation of the site. Benga has committed to return Crown leases to the Crown after reclama tion is completed. Benga will continue to work with Indigenous groups tomitigate potential Project effects on sacred lands. Benga will develop work camp policies related to protecting historical resources and will provide this information to Indigenous groups. A Cultural Site Discovery Contingency Plan will be developedand implemented for culturally important sites identified duringpre-construction or construction. Benga will consult with Indigenous groups prior to conductingmitigation exc avations to ensure opportunities are provided for the development of culturally appropriate practices. Benga will continue to consult with Indigenous groups on thefurther development of the Conservation and Reclamation plans to ensure that Indigenous physical and cultu ral heritage are considered as the site is reclaimed. This includes workingwith Indigenous communities to identify landscape attributes that support traditional practices, uses, and cultural learning (Addendum 10, JRP IR-4.3, CIAR#251).The Project will interact with other past, present, and future physical activities that disturb features associated with sacred, gathering, or habitation sites and change access to physical and cultural heritage. Potential impacts to Indigenous physical and c ultural herita ge have been mitigated at the Project level and are described in Table 6.5 -7 (JRP IR-6.5). Benga is committed to implementing measures to reduce cumulative effects on Indigenous physical and cultural heritage on a regional scale through the following: an Indigenous Environmental Stewardship Committee will be established, to provide advice on land use values and sites of cultural, spiritual and traditional importance as they arise (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 19.0, CIAR#251); support an Indigenous Monitoring Program that will include consideration of cultural heritageimpacts and monitoring for cultural sites (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251); work with Alberta Culture and Tourism and the Indigenous community to develop and plan for mitigation of identified TK/TU features if avoidance is not possible (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251); make minor modifications to the Projectfootprint to avoid and protect pre -contact to meet with Indigenous communitiesto discuss management of identified culturally important a nd sacred sites (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251); develop and implement a Cultural Site Discovery Contingency Plan in consultationwith Indigenous communities for culturally important sites discovered during constructionor operations (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR#251); and continue to improve the AMP for construction and operation phases of the Project that includes notification of access restrictions duringconstruction as required for safety purposes to allow for planning alternate land use locations (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-2, CIAR #251).After implementation of the mitigations and assuming future projects occur as planned, there will be residual cumulative effects on physical and cultural heritage due to disturbance to feature s associated with sacred, gathering, or habitation sites, disturbance to use or access to physical and cultural heritage, and change in the cultural value o r importance associated with physical and cultural heritage. Residual cumulative effects are charac terized as (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.1-1, Section 18.4.2.2, CIAR#251): Low magnitude because the Project footprint overlaps existing disturbance and contribu tions of the Project and future development to cumulative effects are predicted to be small. The Pr oject's contribution will be reduced by implementing pre -construction measures and a cultural site discovery contingency plan. Regional geographic extent be cause cumulative effects are occurring over the traditional territories used by Indigenous groups. Medium-term because disturbance to sites and features and loss of access will occur during construction and operation, and reclamation the Project footprint is expected to improve land use for traditional purposes following mine closure. Continuous frequency because cumulative loss of physical and cultural heritage will be continuous throughout construction and operation until closure. Non-reversible because, although implementation of the AMP, C&R Plan, and regional efforts will improve conditions for tradi tional land use such as access to physical and cultural heritage sites and features, any loss of heritage sites and features or loss of engagement with phys ical and cultural heritage could have a permanent affect on cultural identity and human well -being from loss of intergenerational transfer of knowledge.

Consultant Report #9 - Wildlife. (CIAR #42). Information Request Package #5 from the Joint Review Panel to Benga, Information Request 5.34. (CIAR #215). Tenth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. Response to Information Request 5.34. (CIAR #251). Information Request 5.34 (CIAR #215) requested Benga provide an assessment of the American Badger, which was recently listed on the Species at Risk Act , Schedule 1. The assessment was to include habitat require ments, identified critical habitat and/or recovery habitat of the species at risk. This assessment also requested Benga provide the potential Project effects on the species and their critical habitat. Benga's response to IR 5.34 (CIAR #251), regarding the American Badger, provided a description of its habitat requirements and respective changes in habitat availability within an Application Case assessment. Benga stated, \"Traditional American badger habitat is characterized by grassland, steppe and open fore st but recent studies have shown that they will also utilize open or roaded areas within forest environments (COSEWIC 2012)\". Benga also noted that \"Other suitable habitat includes linear corridors, particularly in forested areas, non-forested or open- forested patches in alpine regions, wetlands and grasslands.\" Within the Application Case assessment, Benga stated that the primary effect of the Project development is related to direct habitat loss. The assessment focuses on habitat availability and includes grasslands (290.3 ha or 5.1%), perennial forage crops (37.3 ha clearings (212.4 ha or 3.8%), road- sides (124.8 ha or 2.2 %), and seeded wellsites and pipeline right -of-ways (65.2 ha or1.1%). These habitats account for 12.9% (730 ha) of the Wildl ife Local Study Area (WLSA) however Benga's assessment does not include a discussion of open forest habitat types. Consultant Report #9, Table 2.4-1 Wildlife Habitat Types and Ecosite Phases Present in the Wildlife Local Study Area (WLSA) indicates open forest habitat exists within the WLSA (CIAR #42). Further, Table 2.4-31 titled \"Detection Frequency (No./100 Camera Days) of Carnivores by Camera and Habitat Type in the WLSA 2015-2016\" indicates detection of American badger within a habitat type categorized as \"Moderate Mixed Coniferous.\" In Consultant Report #9, Table 2.4-1 Wildlife Habitat Types and Ecosite Phases Present in the Wildlife Local Study Area (CIAR #42), Benga provided an area of 37.3ha or 0.7% for perennial forage crops (agriculture) which dif fers from the above stated percentage of 3.8% for perennial forage crops. The same 3.8% for perennial forage crops was also used for the Baird's Sparrow's Application Case assessment. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 135 The information requested below is required in order to complete the following: Terms of Reference, Section 4.7.1 [A]: \"Describe, quantify, and map all existing habitat disturbance (including exploration activities) and identify those habitat disturbances that are related to existing approved project operations.\" EIS Guideline s, Section 6.3.3: \"direct and indirect effects of the Project on federally listed species at risk and those species listed by COSEWIC classified as extirpated, endangered, threatened, or of special concern (flora and fauna)...\". a)Explain why Benga excluded open forested areas from the American Badger's habitat availability assessment under the Application Case. Response: Open forested areas within the WLSA should have been included in the Application Assessment. Therefore, Benga has updated the Response to JRP IR -5.34 (Addendum 10, CIAR#251) for American badger as indicated below in the response to part 6.9b (Note - new i nformation or changes have been underlined). b) Provide an updated assessment with the inclusion of the open forested areas for the Americ an Badger. Response: AMERICAN BADGER The American badger was listed as a Schedule 1 species under the SARA on February 2, 2018 following the submission of the updated EIA for the Grassy Mountain Project in 2016 (CIAR#42). A detailed description of the vegetation and biophysical features of the local and regional study areas is presented, Consultant Report (CR) #8 - Veget ation and Wetlands (EIA, CIAR#42) and wildlife study areas, baseline inventory methods and information on baseline wildlife habitats are p rovided in, CR#9 - Wildlife (EIA, CIAR #42). Status Distribution Three subspecies of American Badger ( Taxidea taxus) occur in Canada ( T. t. jacksoni, T. t. taxus and T. t. jeffersonii ). Populations, which occur in four designatable units (DU), are distributed throughout southern regions of western and central Canada, inhabiting areas from the eastern slopes of the coastal mountains in British Columbia to the boreal forest of south -eastern Manitoba (COSEWIC 2012). The taxus subspecies occurs in the Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and northwestern Ontario DU. In Alberta, its range extends approximately from the North Saskatchewan border south to the Montana border, and from the Saskatchewan border west to the foothills (Scobie 2002). BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 136 Prior to the definition of subspecies boundaries, the American badger was considered to represent a single population in Canada and was classified as \"No Designation Required\" in 1979 by COSEWIC. The designation was changed to \"Not at Risk\" when COSEWIC terminology changed in 1995. The populations were then defined by the geographical boundaries in 2000 and reassessed. The status of American badger occurring in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba was reassessed again in 2012 and designated as Special Concern under COSEWIC (COSEW IC 2012). The taxus subspecies was added to Schedule 1 of the SARA and classified as \"Special Concern\" in February 2018. There is no evident decline in populations occurring in Alberta and while the estimated number of mature indiv iduals is unknown, badgers continue to be harvested for fur and mortality by landowners in the province is not regulated. The main threats to badger habitat and populations are land use changes ( e.g., intensive agricultural practices), vehicle collisions, use of rodenticides (e.g., in relation to pasture lands, loss of important prey species such as northern pocket gophers and Richardson's ground squirrels), and fire suppression (increasing shrubs and woody vegetation) (Scobie 2002, COSEWIC 2012). Populati on Trend Based on an Alberta wildlife survey in conducted in 1999, COSEWIC estimated that the badger population ranged from 1,000 to 10,000 individuals. There are no reliable population trends over the past 10 years, although fur records suggest a signifi cant historical decline in population levels. For example, 18,000 pelts were recorded in 1928 while recent fur data shows a decrease in pelts sold between 1999 and 2010 with an average of 734 badgers trapped annually (COSEWIC 2012). The west and east DUs have a population of less than 250 and 160 mature individuals, respectively while the south -western Ontario population is estimated at less than 200 adults (COSEWIC 2012). In Alberta, annual fur production of badger based on export permits decreased from 391 in 2013/2014 to 155 in 2017/2018 for a five year average of 244 pelts (GoA 2019). Life History and Habitat Requirements Habitat Preferences Traditional American badger habitat is characterized by grassland, steppe and open forest but recent studies have shown that they will also utilize open or roaded areas within forest environments (COSEWIC 2012). Specifically, badgers require suitable soil conditions for digging and abundant prey within the habitat. The soil must be able to maintain its structure when tunnelled such as c ourse silts, fine sands and low colluvial material. Other suitable habitat includes linear corridors, particularly in forested areas, non -forested or open- forested patches in alpine regions, wetlands and grasslands. Critical habit at for American badger h as only been identified for Ontario (Environment Canada 2013) but has not yet been established for the Alberta population. The American badger is carnivorous, feeding on other animals such as BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 137 voles, deer mice, wood rats, prairie dogs, gophers, squirrels, moles, marmots, birds and even insects. Life History Badgers begin mating in July and August. Males do not mature until after their first year and less than half of females will breed during their first summer (COSEWIC 2012). Fema les give birth to a litt er ranging from 1 to 5 kits in March or April. Badgers are adaptable to fluctuating weather conditions and resource availability. They may enter into a shallow torpor during winter and are generally tolerant of humans and certain development. Their diet primarily consists of small rodents such as ground squirrels, marmot and woodchucks. Pocket gophers, voles, mice, insects, birds, reptiles and amphibians also supplement the badger's diet. Movements and Home Range Although the hom e range of the American badger in Alberta is unknown (Scobie 2002), home ranges in British Columbia varies from 33 to 64 km 2 for males and 16 to 18 km2 for females and varies widely in the United States, depending on the season (COSEWIC 2012). Based on a review of nine studies c onducted in North America, the average home range size was 97 km 2 for males and 12 km2 for females. In Canada, Badgers ( taxus subspecies) occur in the Prairie Provinces from east of Winnipeg, south of Lake Winnipeg and west to the Alberta Rocky Mountains. Their northern extent is defined into the Boreal Transition ecoregion. For these prairie ranges, the extent of occurrence is estimated at 721,096 km 2 while the index of area of occupancy is approximately 173,000 km2 (COSEWIC 2012 ). Juvenile badgers leav e within their first summer and may travel as far as 52 km for females and 110 km for males although the average dispersal rate is 11 km by 106 days of age (COSEWIC 2012). They have the ability to cross major physiogeographic barriers and their home range size is likely dependent on female availability. Regional Importance American Badgers are top predators in their specific ecosystems. With their diet mainly consisting of small mammals such as ground squirrels, voles and mice, they have a role in maintaining these populations. Badgers also create patch disturbances in grassland habitats which can influence plant communities by loosening and aerating the soil, promoting humus formation and increasing permeability. Other burrowing species will use badger dens for shelter and nesting such as snakes, pocket gophers, swift fox and burrowing owls. Badgers are also valued for their fur in Alberta and their skins are of importance to the Piikani Nation in the Crowsnest Pass region which are used as traditional garments. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 138 Application Case Assessment Change in Habitat Availability The primary effect of Project development on available American badger in the WLSA is related to direct habitat loss. Potential badger habitats include open natur al grassy areas in the m ontane and alpine zones of the WLSA associated with forests such as open pine (516.7 ha or 9.2% of the WLSA), open deciduous (51.6 ha or 0.9%), open mixedwood (291.2 ha or 5.2%) and open mixed coniferous (440.5 ha or 7.8%) habitats along with grasslands (2 90.3 ha or 5.1%) ( EIA, CR#9, Table 5.5-1, CIAR#42). In addition, badgers may also use various anthropogenic disturbance types in the WLSA that are grass-dominated such as perennial forage crops (37.3 ha or 0.7%), seral clearc 3.8%), and road- sides (124.8 ha or 2.2 %) and seeded well sites and pipeline rights- of-way (65.2 ha or potential account for 40.2% (2,269.7 ha) of the WLSA. During ma ximum project disturbance in Year 14, a loss of potential suitable badger habitat is predicted. This includes losses of 150.7 ha (-51.9%) of grassland and 161.2 (- 44.3%) of open forest habitats, along with 1,520.7 ha (-80.1%) associated with the Project f ootprint ( EIA, CR#9, Table 5.1-1, CIAR#42). These habitat losses are expected to be temporary since the availability of potentially suitable badger habitat in the WLSA is expected to increase as the Project -relate d disturbances are progressively reclaimed . In year 27, changes in habitat availability resulting from Project development are expected to result in an increase in grassland habitat of 58.8 ha (20.2%) and a decrease in open forest habitats of 37% (-129.0 ha) (Table 5.1-1). This represents a sligh t net loss of 70.2 ha (- 3.1%, 2,199.5 ha of habitat available at Year 27) from baseline (2,269.7 ha) of potential badger habitat in the WLSA. Potentially suitable anthropogenic disturbance habitats located outside the Project footprint, but within the WLS A (such as perennial forage crops, early seral clearcuts, clearings, road-sides, and seeded well sites and pipeline rights-of-way) are expected to be roughly similar to baseline conditions. However, existing anthropogenic disturbances ( e.g., trails, roads) within the Project footprint will be reclaimed at closure. In addition, as Project reclamation progresses across the landscape, grass- dominated reclaimed sites may provide suitable habitat for badgers for many ye ars. For example, grassland and open shrubby habitats were rated as high and moderately high for elk, respectively (EIA, CR#9, Appendix C, Section 2.8, CIAR#42). These habitat types, which provide important foraging habitats for elk throughout the year, are expected to decrease by 46% (-197.0 ha ) at Year 14 but increase by 129% (550.1 ha) from baseline as reclamation progresses across the Project footprint (EIA, CR#9, Table 5.3-20, Figure 5.3-46, CIAR#42). Overall, potential American badger habitat in th e WLSA is predicted to decrease slightly f rom baseline conditions following mitigation and reclamation. Project development is not expected BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 139 to negatively affect badger habitat in the WRSA since most of the suitable habitat is located east and southeast of the Project footprint. Table 5.1-1 Change in Wildlife Habitat Between the Baseline and Application Cases in the Wildlife Local Study Area (Source: EIA, CR#9, CIAR#42) Habitat Type Baseline (ha) Year 14 Year 27 Applicatio n (ha) Change Application (ha) Change ha % ha % Open Pine 516.7 Closed -16.3 -91.1 Treed Wetland 4.8 4.8 0.0 0.0 4.8 0.0 0.0 Rock Barren 48.6 16.8 5,646.4 - - Change in Movement Movements of American badgers in the WLSA will be affected since most of the habitat available for badgers will be affected by development of the Project footprint at Year 14 (EIA, CR#9, Figure 5.1-1, CIAR#42). However, following mitigation and reclamation, badger movements are not expected to be affected in Year 27. The single badger that was photographed was travelling on a trail at the edge of a moderate mixed coniferous stand and the existing coal mine disturbance in an alpine area of the WL SA. Badgers will be displaced to other more suitable habitats adjacent to the Project footprint. While badgers are relatively tolerant of BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 140 anthropogenic disturbances, movements along the access corridor and the 5.4 km long coal conveyor may be affected. Change in Mortality Risk The American badger is still managed in Alberta as a furbearing species and one of the main anthropogenic risks of mortality in the WLSA and WRSA is trapping. Both the WLSA and WRSA fall within Fur Management Zones (FMZ) 6 where badger trapping can occur from December 1 to April 15. In addition, the badger may be hunted, without a license and during all seasons, by a resident on privately owned land to which the resident has the right of access AEP (2019). With Project development, hunting and trapping will not be allowed with the Mine Permit Area which should function i n minimizing this risk for the American badger. The badger is also highly susceptible to road-kill. Badger prey are generally attracted to roadside conditions of quality grass and friable soils (Weir et al. 2004b, cited in COSEWIC 2012) causing badger to become prone to mortality from vehicles. There is no data collected on road - kill in the Alberta populations but badgers have suffered high rates of road- kill in s imilar ecosystems such as southern Idaho (Messick and Hornocker 1981). Vehicle collisions can be reduced by establishing and enforcing a low speed limit on the access road. Density of roads are not likely to increase but traffic volume will rise along th e access road to the mine. Change Relative Abundance Although the American badger was identi fied as wildlife species that could potentially occur in the WLSA, its presence within the WLSA was confirmed through wildlife camera trapping in August 2015 ( EIA, CR#9, Section 2.4.3.3.2.1, CIAR#42). This was the only badger sighting recorded either inci dentally or through baseline wildlife inventories conducted in the WLSA between 2013 and 2016. It appears that the American badger is one of the least abundant mustelid species at baseline in the WLSA, although should the Project be approved, pre- disturb ance surveys will be conducted to further confirm species presence and relative abundance. Mitigation Measures Benga will implement the appropriate best management practices, Project features and mitigation measures to minimize risk on federally -listed (SA RA) species at risk. Although critical habitat has not been identified for American badger in Alberta, any future federal action plans including any species-specific mitigation and monitoring plans developed by ECCC and applicable to the taxus DU will be implemented. In the interim, if any badgers are detected during pre- disturbance surveys that w ill be conducted in the WLSA should the Project be approved, specific mitigation measures will be developed in consultation with AEP and ECCC. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 141 Many of the Projec t effects associated with wildlife habitat loss (including badger habitat) will be minimized by implementing the Project's reclamation plan which includes the following: minimize the overall disturbance footprint through the mine planning process to avoid critical breeding habitats, nesting and denning sites, and movement corridors to theextent pos sible; preserve remnant forest patches within the development areas where feasible to provide habitat, habitat connectivity and hide cover for wildlife species; remnant patches should protect known essential raptor habitat features by incorporatingthese h abitat features ( i.e., mature balsam poplar and aspen) where possible; maximize the direct placement of salvaged soil to enhance native plant development; retain slash and large woody debris in the salvaged soil to provide microsites for native plant and h ide cover for wildlife; establish a variety of vegetation species and communities suitable for wildlife, andencourage structural complexity within the forests; encourage understory complexity in reclaimed forests by planting native shrubs such as alder an d willow; ensure that core security areas are provided for wildlife; provide water management program that ensures the surface water quality is maintained; and limit sight lines by maintaining mature forest stands as buffers between roads and reclamation a reas. To support the reclamation plan mitigation measures, the following will be implemented to mitigate potential direct and indirect Project effects on wildlife habitat availability: Incorporate existing legacy mining disturbances into the development and reclamation plans for the Project, and other proposed land use activities to the best extent possible sothat habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, linear distu rbance features, and cumulative habitat loss are minimized. Pre-disturbance surveys (wildlife s weeps) will be conducted in the development area prior to any construction activities during Project development to determine theoccurrence of any important wil dlife habitat features such as migratory bird nests, mineral licks, active dens, bat habitat an d hibernacula, active raptor nest sites, and essential raptor habitat features (i.e., mature balsam poplar, platform/stick nests) that could indicate the presence of species at risk. Protect all important wildlife habitat features in areas of suitable wildlife habitat (on theedge of the Project footprint boundary) appropriate setback distances (or buffer zones)will be considered. Clearing and equipment use/storage/cleaning in undisturbed areas within and adjacentto the Project footprint will be avoided.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 142 Vegetation adjacent to high- activity linear corridors (e.g., access roads, coal conveyor) will be retained to reduce the extent of noise and visual sensory distu rbances to the extent possible. The overland coal conveyor system was designed in such a manner to prevent any deposition of coal product along the route from the CHPP to the rail load-out area. This includes a cover for the length of the conveyor to reduce dust, and motor specificationsto reduce industrial noise levels. Where appropriate, vegetat ed buffer zones (100 m or minimum of 30 m; pending topography constraints) will be maintained between Project infrastructure and wetlands,creeks, and streams to the best extent possible. As required by the Weed Control Act and Regulations, all identified noxious andinvasive weed species populations will be controlled prior to any site disturbance andmine operation to prevent the further spread of weeds. Noxious weed management willoccur in compliance with R&R/03-4 Weeds on Industrial Development Sites . As the presence of artificial lighting can potentially affect bird and bat use of nearbyhabitats, Benga has developed a visual impact mitigation plan that redu ces stray and non-essential artificial lighting to minimize wildlife effects and that will comply with OH&S safety requirements ( EIA, CR#1 - Air Quality, CIAR#42). To mitigate the potential effects of sensory disturbance (acoustic and visual) on effective habitat availability in the southeast portion of the Gold Creek valley, Benga will install and maintain a 15 -m tall earth berm along the eastern edge of the south disposal area ( EIA, CR#2 - Noise Impact Assessment, CIAR #42). The earth berm will be constructed/maintained during the day-time when required and will grow in elevation as the height of t he disposal area increases. Sensory disturbance from the active mine site will be further mitigated through the useof mufflers on all internal combustion engine s, utilizing mine pit topography to shield noise generated from haul trucks, and conducting blasting during daylight hours ( EIA, CR#2 - Noise Impact Assessment, CIAR#42). The following general wildlife mitigation measures will be implemented to minimize potential disruption to daily and seasonal wildlife movements: A minimum of six wildlife crossings (underpasses and overpasses) will be incorporated into the design of the coal conveyor (the conveyor route isapproximately 5.4 km in length): will be strategically placed in locations that will maximize wildlife use (e.g., presence of well used trails, suitable habitats, and terrain features such as valleys and depressions that act as natural crossings); additional pre-disturbance surveys will be conducted to identify importantwildlife habitats and trails along the access road and conveyor corridor; natural underpasses using topography are preferred; andBENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 143 above-ground crossings may be required when topography isn't favourable, conveyor will likely be raised higher above the ground to allow wildlifemovement under it. Surface water management ponds and ditches located in undisturbed areas of the Project footprint will be designed to allow wildlife to move around or cross safely. Road plowing and grading will be conducted in a manner that does not restrict wildlife from crossing access roads or accessing wildlife crossings. Measures to control dust and other air emissions ( e.g., watering of roads and use of dust suppressants, minimizing engine idling, etc. ) within t he Project footprint will be implemented to minimize effects on adjacent wildlife habitats ( EIA, CR#1 - Air Quality, CIAR#42). Project- specific mitigations targeted to carnivore species have been incorporated into the reclamation planning. Many of these w ill also support habitat connectivity for migratory birds, raptors, and species at risk, and include: minimize the overall disturbance footprint through the mine planning process; preserve remnant forest patches in the development areas to provide essential habitat, habitat connectivity, and hide cover for wildlife species; retain slash and large woody debris in the replaced soil landscape; plant native shrubs early in the reclamation process to initiate hiding cover; establish mixed wood forest stands and high density coniferous tree stands; provide understory complexity in the reclaimed forests by planting native shrubs such as alder and willow to provide security cover for the carnivores and their prey; maximize the amount of ungulate habitat; prior to final reclamation, disrupt linear disturbances and sight lines by mounding surface soils, piling brush; and limit sight lines by maintaining mature forest stands or by planting high density coniferous stands to act as buffers between roads, project disturbance boundaries and the reclaimed mine areas. Wildlife mortality risk may increase as a result of increased traffic, wildlife encountering equipment, or elements of the Project footprint, and wildlife being attracted to Project facilities or humans. The Gra ssy Mountain area currently has a considerable network of trails and roads that a re heavily used. Plans are already being implemented to reduce this level of access and with the approval of this Project, the levels will be reduced considerably more. Mitigation measures that will be implemented to reduce wildlife mortality risk includ e: All access to the Mine Permit will be controlled, no uncontrolled access will be permitted. Common operational practices will include: prohibiting use of snowmobiles and A TVs;BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 144 prohibiting hunting, harassment, or feeding of wildlife; and implementing a strictly enforced zero tolerance policy on the use of firearms. Timing vegetation site clearing activities to occur outside the April 15 to August 31 period to avoid disruptin g nesting migratory and resident songbirds and raptors: In the eve nt that vegetation clearing must occur within the restricted activity period, pre- disturbance nesting surveys will be conducted by experienced avian biologists according to established sensitive species inventory guidelines (GoA, 2013b). Establish species- appropriate setback distances around confirmed active nest sites until fledging in consultation with Environment Canada and AEP. If thestatus of a nest cannot be confirmed, or if a nest i s found outside of the breeding season, a setback distance will be implemented until such time as the nest status can be confirmed (GoA, 2013b). Confirm the presence/absence of bats in high quality habitats located within the Project footprint prior to the initiation of any clearing activities and develop a mitigation pl an if bats are found. Conducting pre -disturbance denning (bears, marten, etc. ) and roosting (bats) surveys prior to vegetation clearing and other high-disturbance activities. Consult with A EP as needed to develop appropriate mitigation and management stra tegies. Conducting pre -disturbance surveys (acoustic surveys and visual searches) to identify wetlands and watercourses used by breeding Columbia spotted frogs and western toadsthat feed in to the protection plans. Benga commits to supporting active bear m anagement plans associated with the Project. If a site -specific plan is required, it will be developed in consultation with AEP personnel as part of the Wildlife Mitigation and Monitoring P lan. The plan is expected to be a comprehensive document that out lines operational strategies and best practices for addressing concerns related to not only bear- human conflicts but potential risks to ungulates and other wildlife resulting from attraction of bears to the area. Developing a Beneficial Management Plan gui de to minimize potential Project -specific impacts on migratory birds and their habitat by identifying more site- specific mitigation and monitoring measures following Project approval and in consultation with federal and provincial regulators. A detailed Waste Management Plan will be developed and implemented prior to construction and operational activities to minimize the attraction of wildlife. Benga will follow the Best Management Practices for camps, fences, and barriers as described inBear Smart: Best Management Practices for Camps, and ensure all waste is stored in wildlife -proof containers and disposed of properly. Some of the waste management and bear awareness/Bear Smart guidelines that will be implemented include: ensuring food waste, refuse, and other attractants are securely contained in enclosed and approved bear -proof containers and/or facilities (e.g., hard-sided buildings, fenced compounds, and bear- proof transfer station) prior to transportation to a disposal facility to prevent access by s cavenging bears;BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 145 providing adequate signage to inform employees of the location and proper use of bear-proof storage containers/facilities; ensuring waste storage containers/facilities are n ot filled beyond capacity; ensuring regular inspection and maintenance of waste storage containers/facilitiesis carried out; ensuring measures contained in the bear management plan are diligently followedby all employees and contractors; all on -site staff will receive Bear Awareness Training; and bear warning signs will be installed to advise staff of locations where problembears have been reported. Implementing an Emergency Spill Response Plan to limit the effect of accidental spills. Spills will be minimized by restricting fuel storage and filling to designated area s that are at least 100 m from wetlands and watercourses as well as Project drainage ditches, sediment control ponds, and pit lakes. Storing all hazardous materials, including those used for blasting, in secure areas thatare inaccessible to wildlife ( e.g., buildings, storage areas surrounded by wildlife-proof fencing). In addition, proper handling and storage of industrial materials and debriswithin the Project footprint will be maintained to minimize potential risks to wildlife. Developing procedures to clear blasting areas of large mammals or birds prior to blasting. Designing water management ponds and drainage ditches, and pit lakes to minimize potential entrapment of wildlife. Developi ng a strategy to minimize changes in water quality upstream of the mine in conjunction with a water-quality monitoring program. Enforcing speed limits (50 km/hr) along the main access road and utility corridors, and placing signs at identified wildlife crossings to increase driver diligence to minimize wildlife -vehicle collisions. Vehicles will yield to all wildlife crossing the main access road. Bird collisions with buildings will be mitigated by placing visual markers on windows, and collisions with the proposed power line will be mitigated by installing large 'floats' or other markers. Wildlife monitoring will be used to monitor the effects of the Project on wildlife species at risk or species of management concern during construction and operation of the Project and post- closure. In particular, the effects of the P roject on wildlife VCs, including disturbance, mortality, and movement will be monitored. Monitoring will consist of a systematic monitoring program along with incidental observations. The wildlife monitoring program will serve a number of important func tions including: verifying impact predictions and monitoring the effectiveness of mitigation measures;BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 146 improving Benga's understanding of the effects of Project construction and operation; on wildlife within the WLSA and surrounding area to enable the implementation of adaptive; management practices when required; and ensuring compliance with the terms and conditions of the Operating Approval and Project environmental standards once the Project has been approved by AER andCEAA. Details of the monitoring plan have been developed and are presented in the Wildlife Mitigation and Monitoring Plan (Addendum 10, Appendix 5.39-1 in response to JRP IR -5.39, CIAR#251). Effects Assessment The primary effect that Project development will have on American badger is likely associated with direct habitat loss. Potential habitat types in the WLSA that provide either suitable foraging or burrowing habitats for badgers includes native grasslands, open forest and grass-dominated anthropogenic habitat types ( e.g., perennial forage crops, seeded well sites and pipeline rights- of-way, etc. ). In addition, further indirect habitat loss will occur from increased noise levels associated with constructio n and operations activities even though the badger can be relatively tolerant of certain anthropogenic activities. Any American badgers present within the immediate vicinity of the Project footprint will be displaced to other more suitable habitats present to the east and south until at least progressive reclamation is initiated. With Project development, mortality risk associated with hunting and trapping will not be allowed within the Mine Permit Area which should function in minimizing these risks for the American b adger. However, the badger is susceptible to collisions with vehicles because of the presence of suitable foraging and burrowing habitats associated with roadsides. The potential for badger- vehicle collisions can be reduced by establishing and enforcing a low speed limit on the access road. Badger movements are not expected to be affected by the Project. Potential direct or indirect effects resulting from increased exposure to chemicals of concern as a result of the Project were assessed in the updated s creening -level wildlife risk potential adverse population- level effects to terrestrial wildlife associated with chemical emissions from the Proj ect. As previously mentioned in the Baird 's sparrow effects assessment summary, the methods and guidelines as provided in the screening level- WRA were established to be protective of population- level adverse effect(s) and exposures to chemical(s) at concentrations lower than those presented in the updated screening level -WRA would not be expected to cause ill- effect. As such, the TRVs used within the updated screening -level WRA are considered protective of the American badger and the conclusi ons of the sc reening -level WRA remain unchanged. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 147 Specifically, that chemical concentrations associated with Project emissions would not be expected to cause population level adverse effects on wildlife. Of note, the updated screening- level WRA was amended as part of this IR response package (Addendum 11, JRP IR-6.28) to include an evaluation of water -based exposure pathways (both groundwater and surface water) and the results presented for Blairmore Creek and Gold Creek were not considered to be indicative of adverse effects to wildlife (Addendum 11, JRP IR-6.28). For the proposed end pit lake (EPL) (at closure, when the pit is proposed to be created), the results of the risk assessment are not considered indicative of a human health concern; however, the conservative modeling associated with the development of the HQ for mallard duck (only) indicated a potential risk for that particular group, as such management considerations of the EPL were noted, and actual measured concentrations at the time of EPL creation (at closure) would be used to revisit predicted effects. The overall effects of Project development on the American badger in the WLSA are predicted to be local in extent, extended in duration, continuous in frequency, low in magnitude, and high in probability. The Project contribution to changes in abundance and habitat availability will be negative during the lifespan of the Project, but will be reversible in the long- term. The confidence rating associated with this assessment is moderate, since although a sin gle badger was recorded, the American badger is likely an uncommon species in the WLSA. In terms of the potential effects of the Project on the persistence of this species in southwestern Alberta, the effects are considered to be Not Significant. This ra ting is partly based on the small proportion of potential grassland and open forest habitats that will be lost to the Project, the likelihood that most of the habitats potentially used by American badger will be replaced or increased over the long term through the proposed reclamation program, and with implementation of the general wildlife and species -specific mitigation and monitoring plans.

Response: There is a typographical error in reporting the percentage of perennial forage crops available for Baird's sparrow and American badger in the text of the assessments. It appears that the value of 3.8%, which is the value of cleared habitats (ecosite phases CL and CO) located immediately above the perennial forage crop line in Table 2.4-1 (EIA, CR#9, CIAR#251), was inadvertently used instead of 0.7%.

Response: The total potential habitat for American Badger is confirmed in the response to part b). As noted in the response to part c), despite the typographical error, the percentage for perennial forage crop w as used correctly in all habitat calculations, and as such, the total pote ntial habitat for Baird's Sparrow of 730 ha (as reported in the response to JRP IR-5.34, Addendum 10, CIAR#251) remains unchanged. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 149 Information Request 6.10 Grassy Mountain Coal Proje ct Updated Environmental Impact Assessment. Consultant Report #9 - Wildlife. (CIAR #42). Information Request Package #5 from the Joint Review Panel to Benga, Information Request (CIAR #215). Information Request 5.35 (CIAR #125) requested Benga provide clarification regarding the use of Elk as a surrogate species for Common Nighthawk and Bobolink, with supporting research or literature to justify the approach. Benga's response in the Tenth Addendum (CIAR #251) stated that, \"Elk (as a VC) and common nighthawk (as a special status species) do have similar habitat requirements during the snow- free period...\". Benga also stated, \"If the Bobolink does occur in the WLSA, it would most likely be associated with grassland and grass-dominated anthropogenic habitat s (Table 2.4-1, CR#9, EIA) similar to habitats used by both Elk and Common nighthawk.\" Benga provided various habitat assessments within Consultant Report #9 (CIAR #42) for Elk, Common Nighthawk, and Bobolink. Based on these assessments, Benga suggested that the habitat requirements for Elk provide a sufficient representation for migratory birds associated with grassland and open country habitat preference, including Common Nighthawk and Bobolink. Table 4.61 in Consultant Report #9 titled \"Migratory Bird Species with the Potential to Occur in the WLSA and Their Habitat Preferences\" indicated that Elk, a VC with similar habitat requirements to Grassland or Open Country Birds, provides a suitable surrogate to Proje ct effects on habitat availability (CIAR #42). Benga also indicated, as a result, Project effects on Elk and their respective habitat are expected to be similar for the Bobolink and Common Nighthawk. The information requested below is required in order to complete the following: Terms of Reference, Section 4.7.1 [A]: \"Describe, quantify, and map all existing habitat disturbance (including exploration activities) and identify those habitat disturbances that are related to existing approved project operations.\" EIS Guidelines, Section 6.3.3: \"direct and indirect effects of the Project on federally listed species at risk and those species listed by COSEWIC classified as extirpated, endangered, threatened, or of special concern (flora and fauna)...\". a)Describe how the use of Elk as a surrogate species for Common Nighthawk and Bobolink provides adequate habitat overlap to assess Project effects. Include potential gaps or uncertainties. Response: Benga would like to clarify, for the purposes of this inform ation request, that elk was not used as a direct surrogate species for bobolink and common nighthawk as part of the wildlife impact assessment. Although an assessment of Project effects on common nigh thawk was completed in the EIA (CR#9, Section 5.4.2, CIAR #42), Benga considered the information pertinent to Project BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 150 effects on elk habitat availability were appropriate and relevant to the understanding of effects on other species with similar habitat req uirements. Based on that, Benga applied some of the results of the elk assessment (specifically pre and post reclamation habitat suitability losses and gains) in conjunction with the qualitative assessment on common nighthawk, as well as the assessment of the grassland migratory bird species guild ( CR#9, Sect ion 5.5, CIAR#42) to provide a fulsome understanding of the potential effects on common nighthawk. The approach of using a single wide -ranging species as an indicator or \"umbrella\" to predict effects on other similar species within a particular guild or functional community is an accepted practice in biological conservation and assessment (Simberloff 1998, Favreau et al. 2006). Commentary on elk having similar habitat requirements to grassland migratory birds originates from Table 4.6-1 in CR#9 (EIA, CIAR#42). That particular table is reproduced here (Table 6.10- 1) with updates (noted in bold) to support with this clarification.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 151 Table 6.10-1 Migratory Bird Species1 with the Potential2 to Occur in the WLSA and Their Habitat Preferences - Updated [Source: E IA, CR#9, Table 4.6-1, CIAR#42] Migratory Bird Group Species Included SARA- Listed Species Habitat Preferences VCs With Similar Requirements Shorebirds and Other Birds Reliant on Marshes or Rivers American Dipper, Bank Swallow, Common Yellowthroat, Killdeer, in case of Wilson's Warbler and Common Yellowthroat.

BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 153 Additional rationale associated with these updates (in bold) include: Removal of bobolink from the table as an errata. The criteria for \"potential to occur\" as described in footnote 2 of the table, are those \"migratory bird species with a high,moderate, or confirmed Probability of Occur rence rating in Table 2.4-2, CR# 9\" (EIA, CIAR#42). In 2.4-2, as \"low.\" As such, bobolink should nothave been included in Table 4.6-1. Bobolink range in Alberta includes \"central andsouthern Alberta (from Beaverhill Lake to the border regions)..., where it appears to be sporadic (absent from the foothills of the Rockies)\" (COSEWIC 2010, pg. 8). This wasshown ndum 10, JRP IR-5.35, CIAR #251), presented here again for this information request as Figure 6.10-1. This is also supported by results of field work, where Bobolink were not detected during breeding bird surveys nor incidentallyobserved during other wildlife surveys conducted within the WLSA. Bobolink is notassessed or discussed further, as an assessment of Project effects for species not presentin the WLSA is not required. This is further supported by other additional sources of existing information onbobolink distribution in Alberta: the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) andthe Alberta Bi odiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI) monitoring program. BBS Route 04-205 (Coleman) extends in a northeast direction from the Town of Coleman alongRange Roads 43A, 40A, 35A Figure 2.2 -1, CIAR#42) providing a longer term source of in formation on birds in the region (Pardieck et al. 2019). The Coleman BBS route was surveyed on 10 occasions over an 18 year period extendingfrom 2000 to 2017b. During these 10 surveys, no bobolinks were recorded. No otherBBS survey routes occur in the WRSA although there are two routes nearby which maybe more reflective of bobolink habitat. The Summerview route (BBS -04-304) is located 13.5 km east of the WLSA and the Trout Creek route (BBS 04- 404) is located approximately 7.2 km to the northeast ( Figure 6.10-2). Based on this regional BBS data, which are available for a 13 year period (2006 to 2018), seven bobolinks wererecorded only in 2017 along the Trout Creek route (Pardieck et al. 2019). The BBS result s indicate that the WLSA does not provide suitable habitat for bobolink and that this species is more likely to occur in higher quality habitats located beyond the WRSA.The Alberta Biodiversity Mo nitoring Institute (ABMI) breeding bird database does not have reports of bobolink at their monitoring sites located near the Project (and outsidethe GBRSA) (ABMI 2020). Clarification for the grassland or open country bird groupthat common nighthawk was assessed as a special status species. Addition of Baird's sparrow to the grassland or open country bird group. Baird's sparrow was added to SARA Schedule 1 on February 3, 2017, after submission of theEIA. Benga subsequently provided an assessment for t his species ( Addendum 10, JRP IR-5.34, CIAR#251). Since i t was not a SARA -listed bird at the time of completion of the EIS, it was not originally included in the SARA- listed species column of the table. Common nighthawk and elk have similarities in their primary habitat requirements. Potential habitat types in the WLSA that provide either good foraging or nesting habitats for common BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 154 nighthawks may include open forested stands ( e.g., open pine, open deciduous, open mixedwood, and open mixed coniferous types), wetlands ( e.g., shrubby and treed wetlands), open na tural areas ( e.g., grassland, rock/barren types), and various anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., cutblocks, pipelines, well sites, perennial crops, and other clearings) ( CR#9, Section 5.4.2.1, CIAR#42). Elk prefer grasslands and open areas for foraging in both winter and summer and this habitat received the highest ratings in the habitat suitability model. The assessment of potential Project effects on effective habitat for elk included open fores ted stands (open pine, open deciduous, open mixedwood, open mixed coniferous types), grassland, and various anthropogenic disturbances (cutblocks, perennial crops and clearings). In summary, differences in habitat preferences between elk and common night hawk (e.g., wetlands and rock/barren types) are very limited within the WLSA ( CR#9, Table 5.1-1, CIAR #42). As such, information on Projects effects on elk habitat are relevant for supporting the understanding of habitat disturbances on common nighthawk, when viewed in conjunction with the nighthawk- specific assessment. b)Describe how Project effects on Common Nighthawk and Bobolink can be understood through Project effects on Elk. Response: As per the clarification provided in JRP IR -6.10 a) of this info rmation request, an assessment on common nighthawk was completed as part of the original EIA (CR#9, Section 5.4.2, CIAR #42). This section is copied below. Benga considers the assessment is adequate on its own; however, felt it was strengthen ed when viewe d in conjunction with the assessment of the grassland or open country migratory bird group (CR#9, Section 5.5, CIAR#42), and the current elk habitat effectiveness assessment ( CR#9, Section 5.3.10, CIAR#42). The information combined provides a fulsome understanding of potential effects on common nighthawk. \"5.0 Application Case Assessment 5.4 Special Status Wildlife Species 5.4.2 Common Nighthawk 5.4.2.1 Species Account and Potential Project Effects The primary effect that Project development w ill have on common nighthawks is likely associated with direct habitat loss. Potential habitat types in the WLSA that provide either good foraging or nesting habitats for common nighthawks may include open BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 155 forested stands ( e.g., open pine, open deciduous, open mixedwood, and open mixed coniferous types), wetlands ( e.g., shrubby and treed wetlands), open natural areas (e.g., grassland, rock/barren types), and various anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., cutblocks, pipelines, well sites, perennial crops, and ot her clearings). Project development may result in further indirect habitat loss for common nighthawks from increased noise levels associated with construction and operations activities. It is unclear how common nighthawks are affected by anthropogenic noise, although they often live and breed in cities and therefore likely habituate easily to many sources of noise (Brigham et al., 2011). Common nighthawks are therefore unlikely to be completely displaced from the WLSA, although they may avoid areas around the active mine site while high -impact activities (such as blasting) take place. Common nighthawk abundance may decrease during the life of the Project but will likely recover following reclamation of the area. Common nighthawk mortality associated with Project devel opment is likely to be limited to nest destruction associated with vegetation clearing. However, by conducting vegetation clearing outside of the recommended restricted activity period (May to August), common nighthawk mortality (eggs and/or chicks) can b e avoided (Environment Canada, 2015a). Other sources of mortality associated with Project development include collisions with vehicles and Project infrastructure, such as buildings and transmission lines. Vehicle collisions can be reduced by establishing and enforcing a low speed limit on the access road. Bird collisions with buildings can be reduced by placing visual markers on windows, and collisions with the proposed power line can be reduced by placing large 'floats' or other markers on it (APLIC, 20 12). Project development is unlikely to alter common nighthawk movement in the area. The effects of Project development on common nighthawks in the WLSA are predicted to be local in extent, long in duration, continuous in frequency, low in magnitude, high in probability, and not significant (Table 5.4-1). The Project contribution to changes in common nighthawk abundance and habitat availability will be negative during the lifespan of the Project, but will be reversible in the short -term. The confidence r ating associated with this assessment is moderate, as common nighthawks are known to occur and likely breed in the WLSA. 5.4.2.2 Impacts to Recovery Strategy The recovery strategy for common nighthawk ( Contopus cooperi ) in Canada (Environment Canada, 2016b) indicated that there is currently little understanding of what comprises critical habitat for the species in Canada and what are the primary threats to this species' survival. However, reduced availability of insect prey is thought to be a key factor in the decline of this species. There is little known about this species' habitat BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 156 preferences, and its distribution and abundance across Canada. No action plan has yet been developed for this species but planning to eliminate or reduce knowledge gaps about the species is a priority of the recovery strategy. The recovery strategy indicates several knowledge gaps requiring research, including, but not limited to, identification of critical habitat, determining relative important of breeding and non-breeding habitats, determining threats to the species and its prey, determining availability of nesting sites, determining impacts of climate change, and understanding what site characteristics lead to high collision rates. The objectives of the recovery strategy i nclude reducing the decline of the species across its Canadian range (abundance and distribution), halting the national decline of the species by 2025, and subsequently ensuring a 10 year increase in abundance across the country. A loss of suitable breedi ng habitat and reduced population density arising from Project effects in the WLSA would be counter to the initial 10 year plan for common nighthawk. Working in consultation with the common nighthawk recovery team to monitor presence, abundanc e, habitat us e, fidelity to breeding sites, and factors affecting survival and reproductive output within the WLSA would provide valuable information required for the conservation of this species in both the short- term and long- term.\" The assessment for mi gratory birds from the EIA (CR#9, Section 5.5, CIAR#42) is provided below. \"5.0 Application Case Assessment 5.5 Migratory Birds The effects of Project development on 10 selected wildlife VCs were assessed quantitatively using habitat suitability index or resource selection function modelling approaches. One of these species, the olive -sided flycatcher, is protected under the MBCA and SARA. In addition, high-level assessments (which did not include habitat suitability index modelling) were conducted for eight species, two of which are protected by the MBCA and SARA (common nighthawk and barn swallow). As indicated in Section 3.2.3, wildlife VCs were selected based on various criteria including ecological, economic, and traditional use importance. The selected VCs serve as indicator species, which collectively represent most wildlife species in the WLSA, to focus the wildlife assessment in accordance with current practice in Alberta and Canada. To further assess the effects of the Project on migratory birds, species that may occur in the WLSA were divided into groups based on their preferred habitat type (Table 5.5-1). Most of the migratory bird groups have habitat requirements that are similar to wildlife BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 157 species selected as VCs (Table 4.6-1), although some do not. A high level assessment of potential Project effects on habitat availability, fragmentation and connectivity, mortality risk and health, and abundance for each group of migratory birds was conducted based on the criteria described in Table 3.2-3. 5.5.1 Chan ge in Habitat Availability The greatest effect of Project development on migratory birds will be direct habitat los s, most of which is expected to be temporary as disturbed habitats will be reclaimed progressively during Project operations. Wildlife habitat availability under the Baseline and Application (Years 14 and 27) Cases is summarized in Table 5.1-1.The largest extent of habitat loss will occur by Year 14 of Project development, and the largest losses will be of moderate mixed coniferous forest and closed mixedwood forest. Due to the relative scarcity of wet, shrubby habitats in the WLSA, shorebirds, waterfo wl, and other wetland-dependent birds (Table 4.6-1) are expected to be minimally affected by habitat loss. The abundance of species that prefer wet, shrubby habitats, such as common yellowthroat and Wilson's warbler, may decrease in the WLSA as they will be displaced to similar, nearby habitats. Grassland species (Table 4.6-1) occur in the WLSA but are uncommon because of the relative scarci ty of grassland habitat. By Year 14, it is expected that grassland habitat will be reduced by 52% (151 ha) while upland shrub habitat will remain unchanged. However, by Year 27, grassland habitat is predicted to increase by 20% (from 290 has to 349 ha) t hrough progressive reclamation. Therefore, while there will be a temporary decrease in habitat availability for gr assland -dwelling migratory birds up to Year 14, grassland habitat availability is expected to increase in the WLSA following progressive reclamation. Forest -dwelling migratory bird species, particularly those that nest in coniferous and mixedwood forests ( Table 4.6-1), will likely be the most affected by Project development. By Year 27 of the Application Case, there will be a reduction in the area of coniferous forest (open pine, open mixed coniferous, moderate mixed coniferous, closed spruce, and closed m ixed coniferous habitat types) from 2,832 ha to 2,171 ha (661 ha; 23%) and a reduction in the area of mixedwood forest (open mixedwood and closed mixedwood habitat types) from 1,282 ha to 937 ha (345 ha; 27%). The area of deciduous forest in the WLSA (79 ha) will be minimally affected by Project development. By Year 27 of the Application Case, it is expected that deciduous forest will be redu ced by 3.2 ha. Species preferring old -growth forests are generally vulnerable to habitat loss as it can take 100 years or more for a young forest to display old- growth forest characteristics. The WLSA contains 169 ha of old growth forest, of which 8.3 ha will be affected by Project development (CR #8 - Vegetation and Wetlands, Section 4.5.1). Thus, effects of BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 158 habita t loss on these species are anticipated to be minimal. The loss of habitat may potentially be offset if mature forests within the undisturbed parts of the WLSA reach the old-growth stage by Year 27 of the Application Case. A small number of migratory bird species breed in open, rocky habitats, including alpine habitats (Table 4.6-1). By Year 14, it is expected that there will be a loss of 32 ha (66%) of rocky and barren habitat. However, by Year 27, the area of rocky barren habitat is predicted to be 18% greater than Baseline. Some species with the potential to occur in the WLSA frequently build their nests on anthropogenic structures such as buildings or bridges (Table 4.6 -1). One of these is the barn swallow, and the effects of the proposed Project on this species are discussed in Section 5.4.1. The effects of the proposed Project on other species that tend to build their nests on anthropogenic structures are expected to be similar. In addition to direct habitat losses, Project development may result in indirect habitat losses from sensory disturbances since some migratory birds may avoid otherwise suitable habitats located close to the Proj ect footprint. Sensory disturbances ( e.g., noise, artificial lighting) arising from Project development may result in an indirect loss of habitat for migratory bird, as some birds may avoid otherwise suitable habitat because of this disturbance. For example, research conducted by Habib et al. (2007), Bayne et al. (2008), and Bayne and Dale (2011) in the boreal fore st indicates that some migratory songbirds may be negatively affected by chronic anthropogenic noise through indirect loss of habitat (or reduc ed habitat effectiveness). Sound is important for avian communication and chronic noise from well pads, compress ors, and road traffic has been reported to affect songbird density and pairing success (Habib et al., 2007; Bayne et al., 2008). Habib et al. (2007) reported that between 31% and 83% of the bird species analyzed were less abundant near a noise source (com pressor station) than near a control site (a well pad without compressor station). These effects were noted up to 250 m from compressor statio ns. Bayne et al. (2008) found that up to one- third of bird species within 300 m of a compressor station were aff ected by noise levels averaging 48 dBA. The density of birds was 1.5 times higher in boreal aspen forests with no anthropogenic noise than in the same habitat beside a noise-generating compressor station (Bayne et al., 2008). Overall, the geographic extent of all changes in habitat availability to migratory birds are predicted to be local, as no migratory bird species that occur in the area have breeding territories that exceed the size of the WLSA. The duration of Project effects will vary among species, but are predicted to be extended for forest- dwelling birds, residual for species that rely on old -growth forests, and long for all other speci es. The frequency of all Project- related effects on habitat availability for forest -dwelling migratory birds will be continuous, moderate in magnitude and reversible in the long-term. The frequency of BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 159 all Project- related effects on habitat availability f or all non- forest -dwelling migratory bird species will be continuous, nil to low in magnitude, and reversible in the short- term. The proposed Project contribution to changes in habitat availability for migratory birds is predicted to be positive for water fowl, grassland species, and rock/cliff dwelling species and negative for all other species. The confidence rating for these predicted effects is high, the probability of occurrence is high and the predicted significance is not significant. 5.5.2 Habitat Fragmentation and Connectivity Depending on territory sizes and nest locations, some species may be reluctant to cross the active mine area while breeding. Due to their mobility, migratory birds in general are not expected to incur large changes to their movements in the WLSA. With mitigation (Section 7.1.4), the effects of Project development on migratory bird movements are predicted to be local in extent, long in duration, continuous in frequency, reversible in the short-term, low in magnitude, and not significant. The Project contribution to migratory bird movements are predicted to be negative, the confidence rating for this prediction is high, and the probability of effect occurrence is high. 5.5.3 Change in Mortality Risk and Health The destruction of nests during vegetation clearing could represent a source of migratory bird mortality associated with Project development. This source of mortality will be minimized by clearing vegetation outside of the period when most migratory birds breed in the W LSA (April 15 to August 31). Wherever possible, vegetation will be cleared outside of this time period. If clea ring is required when migratory birds may be breeding, nest surveys will be completed prior to the clearing operations to determine if active n ests are present in the vegetation to be cleared. If a nest is found, a temporary buffer zone will be establishe d around the nest, where no clearing may take place until the nest is no longer active. The radius of the buffer will be based on both profess ional judgement and recommendations published by Environment Canada (2016d) and the Government of Alberta (2013c) . Other sources of migratory bird mortality associated with Project development may include bird collisions with windows, vehicles, or the proposed transmission line, or birds being poisoned through ingesting or swimming in contaminated water. After mitigation, increases in mortality from these causes are likely to be very low. Animal collisions on the access road will be reduced through establishing and enforcing a low speed limit, and bird collisions with buildings will be mitigated by placing visual markers on windows. Collisions with the proposed power line will be mitigated by installing large 'floats' or other markers on the lines. A strategy to minimize changes in water quality downstream of the proposed Project is being developed in conjunction with a water -quality BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 160 monitoring program. Post-mitigation, sedimentation ponds will be reclaimed to wetland areas and may be used as breeding and foraging habitat by shorebirds and waterfowl. In addition, changes to the health of waterfowl, shorebirds, and other species that nest along the shorelines and feed on aquatic life could occur if such species nest along the edges of the surge ponds. However, it is anticipated that the level of ongoing disturbance and noise at the surge ponds will deter birds from nesting along the pond edges. Many of the potential Project- related effects on migratory bird mortality risk will be mitigated (Section 7.1.5 ). The largest mortality risk for migratory birds associated with Project development is the destruction of nests during vegetation clearing. However, this source of mortality will be mitigated by clearing vegetation outside of the breeding season for mi gratory birds (April 15 to August 25) to the extent possible. With mitigation (Section 7.1.5), the effects of P roject development on migratory bird mortality risk and health are predicted to be local in extent, long in duration, isolated in frequency, reversible in the short term, low in magnitude, and not significant. The Project contribution to migratory bird mo rtality is predicted to be neutral, the confidence rating for this prediction is high, and the probability of effect occurrence is high. 5.5.4 Abundance Changes in abundance of migratory birds may result from loss of habitats or direct mortality, as descri bed in Sections 5.5.1 and 5.5.2. Because of Project effects associated with direct and indirect habitat losses, the abundance of migratory birds within the Project footprint and adjacent habitats will be reduced over the short- term. Migratory birds will largely be displaced to other suitable habitats in the WLSA and surrounding region. With mitigation (Section 7.0), the effects of Project development on migratory bird abundance are predicted to be local in extent, long in duration, continuous in frequency, reversible in the long term, low in magnitude, and not significant. The Project contribution to migratory bird abundance is predicted to be negative, the confidence rating for this prediction is high, and the probability of effect occurrence is high.\" A summary of the predicted Project effects on wildlife VCs is found in Table 5.4-1, CR #9 (EIA, CIAR#42).

Response to Information Request 3.2. (CIAR #251). It is unclear how the climate change based estimates presented in response to IR 3.2 c) (CIAR #251) will be incorporated into the final dam designs. Benga provided climate change projections for context, however Benga's proposed designs are based on historic precipitation statistics. Given the prediction that with consideration of climate change, the required pond volumes could be expected to be approxi mately 20% greater than under historic conditions (Tables 3.2-4 and 3.2-5, Addendum 10), Benga should consider the construction of larger structures, or operational consequences if the structures end up under-designed. The information requested below is re quired in order to complete the following: Terms of Reference Section 3.2.6.2 [A], (d): \"factors used in the design of water management facilities that are in accordance with Water (Ministerial) Regulation, Part 6 (Dam and Canal Safety), as well as the Canadian Dam Safety Association Dam Safety Guidelines, including expected flood events and flood protection.\" Terms of Reference Section 4.1.2 [B]: \"Identify stages or elements of the project that are sensitive to changes or variability in climate parameters, including frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Discuss what impacts changes to climate parameters may have on elements of the project that are sensitive to climate parameters.\" a)Describe if Benga will adjust its dam design, construction and operations to meet Canadian Dam Association Guidelines under the projected future changes in extreme precipitation (as summarized in response to IR 3.2c)). Response: As stated in the response to JRP IR-3.2 (c) (Addendum 10, CIAR#251), the design of the ponds was based on conservative data producing worst- case scenarios that allow for ample storage capacity. Inflow design flood criteria was based on either the 2/3 1,000 - year and PMF or the 200-year flood event with the minimum storage design criteria set at either the 100 -year or 10-year flood event. The pond designs and overall water management plan allows for activemanagement of any future short duration extreme precipitation events. For clarification purposes, during detailed engineering, Benga will design each dam and the associated construction and operation plans, to meet Canadian Dam Association Guidelines, and will take into consideration the projected future changes in precipitation, evaporation, extreme precipitation, and will adjust each desig n accordingly. Possible changes to precipitation and evaporation patterns and extreme precipitation will be considered over the life of each facility. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 164 As part of the detailed engineering design, eac h dam will be considered separately reflecting the function of the dam ( e.g., sediment dam or surge dam), and the design criteria regarding environmental protection and structural integrity. Each dam will be designed to meet two design criteria - (1) to retain a design flood based on local guidelines and (2) to protect the dam structure by either retaining the CDA inflow design flood or designing a spillway to safely pass that event. Final design criteria and calculations for each dam will be provided to the AER as part of the Canadian Dam Safety application(s). b)If the answer to a) above is no, and the dams are therefore designed to meet Canadian Dam Association Guidelines under historic extreme precipitation but are operated under the projected future extreme rainfall, describe how Benga will operationally address this design issue. Response: See response to part a). BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 165 HYDROGEOLOGY Information Request 6.12 Comments from Tsuut'ina Nation. (CIAR #220). Tenth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. Response to Information Requests 5.18 and 5.19. (CIAR #251). Given the depth of the saturated backfill zones, the size of the waste rock disposal areas, and the complex geology and large uncertainties associated with shallow and deep groundwater flow paths, the Panel requires additional information to assess the economic and technical feasibility of Benga's proposed mitigation measures and adaptive management approach; this includes how Benga intends to monitor both shallow and deeper groundwater for effects, and mitigation measures that can be implemented if effects are detected. Benga's response to IR 5.19 (CIAR #251) indicated that the installation of liners is unfeasible, and not technically achievable due to ground slopes. However, Benga did not substantiate this conclusion with the requested case studies of other mines with similar characteristics, where liners either failed, or were also deemed technically and economically unfeasible. Benga has suggested four other technically and economically feasible seepage capture options, however limited evidence has been provided to support these options as technically effective at monitoring and capturing contaminated groundwater. Tsuut'ina Nation not es that Benga has not provided adequate information to support the assertion that collection wells will collect all seepage water (CIAR #220). The Panel requires Benga to provide additional details on proposed seepage capture options, including how monitoring downgradient from potential contamination sources will be an effective and technically achievable adaptive manage ment measure, given the lack of a thorough hydrogeological understanding of the site. Additionally, in response to IR 5.18 (vii) (CIAR #251), Benga states that 'Consideration will be given to include wells closer to receptors (listed in Part vi., above), a s applicable and if feasible depending on access and ground conditions, to ensure no impact fails to be detected.' As large uncertainty remains regarding seepage water transport via porous media and/or fractures, potential faults, and old mine adits, monitoring wells should be placed slightly upgradient of receptors. If this monitoring is not done, contamination may be missed by near-source monitoring and capture and could reach receptors without warning. The information requested below is required in order to complet e the following: Terms of Reference Section 4.2.2 [C]: \"Describe programs to manage and protect groundwat er resources, including (a)) the early detection of potential contamination; (b) groundwater remediation options in the event that adverse effects are detected; and (c)the monitoring of groundwater production or dewatering impacts.\"BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 166 a)Provide additional evidence including estimated costs, to support Benga's conclusion that the installation of liners is not a technically or economically feas ible seepage capture option. Response: Aside from storage of hazardous liquids and for limited applications in storing slurry tailings, there is no comparable precedent for the use of liners in the coal mining industry. Liners are typically used for stora ge of hazardous liquids and for limited applications as pond liners. We note that Teck in its report entitled \"2019 Implementation Plan Adjustment - Annex J - Alternative Treatment Mitigation Plan\" arrives at the same conclusion. In Section 3.2.2.2 (Appendix 6.19-1) Teck states that it has not considered geotextile liners for management of percolation at its rock dump sites due to the \" level of uncertainty in the science of covers..., combined with the high cost to deploy geosynthetic covers, and practical issues associated with that deployment...\". Benga does not consider that liners can be successful ly deployed in the application of the SBZ for technical reasons. When liners are installed, it is understood that their ability to withstand a puncture is minim al. For this reason, when designing ponds or other liner applications, great care is taken to ensure that there is a well -supported base of clay, sand or finely crushed rock so that larger rocks from below will not penetrate the liner. Similarly, as in the case of the SBZ, if rock or other material is to be layered on top of the liner, a sand (or finely crushed rock) bed of sufficient thickness is required on top of the liner to resist the weight of the meters of rock on top of the liner and prevent a puncture. Although this type of installation may be technically feasible along the floor of the S BZ pit, it will not be possible to place the necessary padding material along the side walls of the pit due to their steep grade. As a result, lateral pressure from the rock fill will undoubtedly puncture a liner in multiple locations due to the sheer mas s of rock. Any significant puncture in the liner at any location below the water level of the SBZ will result in flooding of the entire space below the liner an d allow leakage as if the liner were not present. Any significant leakage due to a puncture wi ll not be evident during the installation and will be impossible to find and repair after the fact. Nonetheless, Benga recognizes the need to reasonably minimize seepage losses from the Saturated Backfill Zone (SBZ), and will use a combination of the follo wing engineering options to achieve this objective: The pit will be extended to below the known level of existing underground openings. Where it is safe and pr actical, rock exposed in the pit floor will be mapped for open fractures associated with faults and joints. Depending on the state of the postBENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 167 mining state of the pit floors, some of the following geophysical methods will be applied to identify and map the structure at depth beneath the pit floor: seismic refraction profiles can be acquired across the pit floor to measure changes in rock velocity with depth; and lines of ground- penetrating radar data can be acquired on a coarse grid across the pit floor to identify major fractures and any voids. Using drone technology and air photos, the observable joint sets in the pit walls will bemapped and plotted on a rose diagram to show the orientation of faults and joint sets. Inaddition, where it is safe and practical, groundwork could be done as warranted toconfirm orientations (dip and strike) of thes e structures. Significant identified fractures will be assessed to determine if they can be sealed withcement or chemical grout, by adopting contact grouting procedures commonly utilizedfor water retaining dams. This assessment will consider factors including safety of theproposed operation, total number of features detected in the SBZ, and the technicalfeasibility of the sealing procedure. b) Provide additi onal details on the following proposed seepage capture options, including an analysis with supporting evidence of their effectiveness by referencing case studies from other mines with similar characteristics to the Grassy Mountain Coal Project: Response: The proposed design for the waste dumps will include the following measures to minimize seepage losses to the ground: Most importantly, Benga has located the waste rock dumps in areas outside of Gold Creek and Blairmore Creek valley bottoms. To the best ex tent possible Benga located the waste rock dumps at higher locations where subsequent capture of any percolatingwater is possible. This mine design feature is not a common mining standard as itrequires expensive hauling of waste rock up hill, which come s at an economic cost to the Project; Before depositing material, as much as possible organic, weak, or fine- grained materials within the foundation of the waste dumps will be removed prior to dumping waste rock.The waste dump foundation will consist of granular, till- like soils, or bedrock (EIA, Subsection B.8.6.3.2.1, page B-76, CIAR#42); Where bedrock is exposed, Benga will assess whether open fractures can be sealed withcement or chemical grout, by adopting contact grouting procedures commonly utili zed for water retaining dams as described in item a) above; and, All spoils are designed t o be constructed in 15m lifts or higher, which form a zone of segregated coarse rock at the base of each lift, particularly the base layer which willform the foundat ion of each spoil and provide adequate drainage through the bottom.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 168 i.Grading the foundation to facilitate effective drainage; Response: In the proposed locations of the North Rock Disposal Area (NRDA) and South Rock Disposal Area (SRDA), the existing top ography is sufficiently steep to provide natural drainage for water collected in the waste dumps (see topography details in Figure 6.12-1). The natural slopes are generally 3:1 for the SRDA and about 2.2:1 to 3:1 for the NRDA. Where necessary, potentially along the natural drainage course (indicated in blue in the Figure 6.12- 1), the foundati on may be graded to increase the natural slope and thus increase the proportion of water to be recovered from within the dumps. ii.Use end-dumping techniques to establish a coarse permeable layer at the base of the dump; Response: The waste dumps will be constructed using a combination of end dumping (dumping from a certain height based on topography and filling in an area that is well confined to shorten haul distances) and bottom up construction. The lift heights on the SRDA and NRDA are planned to be more than 15m high. At this height, a zone of coarse rock sizes is expected to form at the bottom of the lifts which will function to aid in collecting drainage that percolates through the waste dumps (British Columbia Mine and Waste Rock Pile Research Com mittee, 1991; CANMET Rock Drain Research Program, 1997). iii. Use of collection ditches to capture shallow seepage; and Response: Collection ditches and trenches will be used to convey captured discharge from the waste dumps to the surface water ponds. The NRDA is confined to one drainage area and all water will naturally collect at a low point at the SW corner of the NRDA, where a pond, Northwest Surge Pond, is designed at the decant point ( Figure 6.12-1), from which the water will be conveyed back towards the pit through ditches or trenches. The SRDA is located on a western -facing slope and the water will naturally drain to a pond on the NW corner of the SRDA. Where appropriate, the foundation will be sloped to direct the water in the waste dumps toward the collection ditches. Collection ditches will also be installed along the toe of the waste dump, where seepage emerges. Where d eep ditches/trenches may be required , these deep ditches/trenches would be backfilled with waste rock wrapped in geotextile fabric (EIA, Appendix 9b, Section 4.5, CIAR#42). In addition, the waste dumps will be constructed in lifts of 15 m or more, with a minimum 8 m wide benches. Individual benches will be shaped to capture drainage runoff and direct it to BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 169 collection ditches on each side of the dump (British Columbia Mine and Waste Rock Pile Research Committee, 1991. CANMET Rock Drain Research Program, 1997). iv. Installation and pumping of seepage capture wells. Response: Seepage capture wells will be used only as a last resort to capture seepage. The implementation of the proposed key measures for the construction of the waste dumps, as described previously, will minimize infiltration of water from the waste dumps into the foundation, facilitate drainage from the waste dumps that is designed to occur by gravity, and direct the drainage water also by gravity through ditches and trenches to the surface water ponds. c)Explain how Benga's proposed seepage capture options will collect infiltration under low volume conditions where water will infiltrate through the shallow unsaturated (vadose) zone below the sources of contamination. Estimate the percentage of time (per year) when low volume seepage will bypass the seepage capture options via vertical infiltration under unsaturated soil conditions. Response: Benga does not consider that seepage from the SBZ can enter the unsaturated zone as the depth of the SBZ will be below the normal ground wa ter level . Several cross- sections were modelled across the site. The locations of the cross sections are shown in Figure 6.12-2 and the cross- sections are presented , 6.12-5, 6.12-6, 6.12-7, and 6.12-8. The Rock Disposal Areas (RD As) are located on topographic highs and as such will always be above the water table, as illustrated on cross-section AA' in Figures 6.12-3, 6.12-4, and 6.12-5, and therefore will not typically be saturated. The water table will be located a few meters b elow the base of the RDAs and is expected to fluctuate seasonally. Seepage would essentially be immobile within the unsaturated zone. Early reclamation and capping of the RDA will help reduce percolation to lower levels with the objective of consistently minimizing seepage migration towards the groundwater table. Seepage capture wells would operate below the groundwater table if monitoring demonstrates migration of seepage to this zone. d) Provide details on how monitoring downgradient from potential contamination sources will be an effective and technically achievable adaptive management measure , by providing the following with sufficient technical details includingBENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 170 assumptions, justifications of assumptions, and all required details for decision makin g: i.Describe the approach and criteria Benga will use to decide where the downgradient wells would be placed. Explain how Benga will account for shallow and deep groundwater pathways; as well as potential faults, fractures, and old mine adits, all of which could act as conduits for groundwater transport; and ii.Discuss the approach and criteria Benga will use to determine the sampling depth(s) of each monitoring well, and how will Benga confirm the selected sampling depth is capturing potential seepage plumes. Response: Monitoring wells will be located downgradient of each RDA and downgradient of each surge pond. The exact placement and targeted depth of the monitoring wells will be dependent on the local site setting and determined during detailed design but monitoring wells will be located as close as practical to the potential source. The main focus of the groundwater monitoring program will be on the shallow to intermediate groundwater systems that have the potential to discharge near or into the sur face water receptors including Blairmore Creek and Gold Creek. As substantial measures will be implemented to capture potential contaminant at the source, via the measures described in a) and b), the groundwater monitoring program will have the primary objective to confirm the efficiency of the capture program and the secondary objective to ensure that the receptors are not negatively impacted by th e project activities. The legacy mining activities were assessed as part of the modelling exercise and were n ot found to be a pathway for groundwater transport. As a result, groundwater monitoring at these features will be limited. Groundwater monitoring will be at existing portals or seeps associated with historical mines, to confirm the lack of impact associated with the new mining activities. A summary of the proposed groundwater monitoring locations is provided in Table 6.12-1 and Figure 6.12-9. Some of the proposed locations are similar to those proposed for the Aquatic Monitoring Plan. At these locations, only one set of monitoring wells will be installed, that will be used by multiple monitoring programs as part of an integrated groundwater and surface water monitoring program. Existing monitoring wells installed to collect baseline data for the EIA application will also be integrated to the program, as appropriate, to collect baseline data; however, the majority of these wells will be destroy ed during construction or the development of the mine. In addition to the monitoring wells proposed, water sampl es will be collected from toe springs associated with the drainage of the RDAs, from the various surge ponds and sedimentation ponds and from e nd pit lake (either directly or via the discharge line). Main fractures in bedrock will be the primary target of the monitoring wells completed within bedrock units. Data and mapping associated with the core hole exploration program conducted by Benga, in cluding information about the presence of rock discontinuity and joints/fractures BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 171 will be reviewed to estimate th e targeted depth for the upper and lower bedrock wells. The final depth will depend on the lithological and fracture information collected dur ing the drilling at each individual location. Similarly, the location of joints, fractures or more permeable zon es identified during the grading of the rock disposal areas or identified at the bottom of the pit will be reviewed and accounted for when sele cting the final location of the monitoring wells. The final locations of the monitoring wells will target preferential flow pathways, including more permeable fractures and bedrock zones, to maximize the effectiveness of the monitoring program in the early detection of adverse effect. Multiple nested well pairs using traditional nested wells or the use of single bo rehole multi -level technologies ( i.e., Solinst, FLUTe, etc. ) will be considered to increase the ability to monitor multiple depth intervals, ta rget the possible pathways from shallow to deep water bearing zones, and ensure a comprehensive detection of groundwater quantity (water levels and gradient) and quality (chemistry).

Identify where Benga will place the capture wells relative to the plume's center of mass; iii.Describe the strategy Benga will use to capture the plume and identify the percentage of capture Benga will aim to reach (ex. 100%, 70% etc.); and iv.The capture wells will likely capture non-contaminated groundwater downgradient as well as contaminated groundwater, possibly resulting in a sizeable volume of water. Explain how Benga will be able to economically and technologically manage and treat this water. Response: Delineation will be conducted depending on the location of the plume and characteristics of the ground. If a groundwater plume is detected within surficial deposits, typical delineation methods would include drilling additional downgradient/ cross -gradient and deeper wells to understand the lateral and vertical concentrations of the chemical of concern, and ultimately of the plume distribution. Information from the delineation program would also refin e the local understanding of the active flow pathways for the migration of the plume towards the receptors. If the plume is detected within a bedrock well, the first step will consist of reviewing all of the information available for the local area, including maps showing the locations of faults and fractures, to identify potential flow pathways for the plume. If additional characterization is required, different techniques will be considered, specific to contaminant characterization in fractured bedrock. Methods appropriate for the characterization of contaminant in fractured rock (CLU-IN 2020; ITRC 2017) include, charac terization methods; Downhole methods & tools (including flowmeters); and Multilevel we lls and monitoring systems. The objective will be to collect specific information to characterize the fractures (aperture, orientation), identify the permeable zones and , if possible, quantify the groundwater flow in each fractured zone. This process wil l be conducted in phases, such that the results of the previous drilling phase will inform the next drilling phase with respect to presence/absence of faults/fractures an d the presence/absence of the plume, until the plume is adequately delineated. Once th e plume has been sufficiently delineated, appropriate methods will be evaluated for the recovery and/or containment of the plume. As the plume center may coincide with t he source (i.e., rock disposal areas, saturated zones), recovery directly in the center of the plume may not be practical. Recovery downgradient of the source/ plume, but up- gradient of the receptors will BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 175 be considered instead. Options may include seepage capture wells, passive recovery trenches or treatment barriers. The objective will be to contain and mitigate the plume while protecting the downgradient receptors. Consideration will also be given to source control options, such as grouting preferential pathway(s) below the source or installing/ retrofitting liners at the bottom of the ponds. The amount of capture targeted will depend on the setting of the plume (surficial deposits versus bedrock), the size of the plume and the type of contaminant but will be designed with the objective of protection of receptors. Benga acknowledges th at within fractured rock settings, adequate capture will require a high level of effort to achieve. In such a case, Benga will implement capture measures that ensure as much protection and recovery to provide protection of the receptors, and implement a specific monitoring program for the plume, to evaluate the efficiency of the recovery program and monitor nearby receptors. Risk assessment and risk management may also b e implemented to assess the effect of the portion of the plume that is not recovered b y the capture system, as applicable. An active treatment plant is part of the Project's contingency plan, if required. Depending on the volume and nature of the contaminants of potential concern (COPCs), consideration will be given to using the on- site treatment plant to treat recovered groundwater as part of a pump -and- treat system. If the use of the on -site treatment plant is not an option, alternative methods will be considered, including the use of portable treatment units. As different treatment opt ions exist for inorganics and metals, the actual method selected will depend on the COPC present within the plume to be treated, volumes, and concentrations. Existing me thods for the treatment of inorganic parameters and metals include granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption, chemical precipitation -flocculation and sedimentation, ion exchange, and reverse osmosis (EPA 1997; ITRC 2017). f)Describe the approach and criteria Benga will use to decide whether and where upgradient receptor based monitoring i s required. Response: The proposed program, as presented in d) will include locations both downgradient of the potential sources and upgradient of the potential receptors, so the program will include upgradient receptor-based monitoring. The monitoring wells located directly downgradient of the sources are intended to provide early detection of changes to the groundwater quality before any impact to a receptor. The monitoring wells located upgradient of the source will collect baseline water quality data and confirm that the receptors are not affected by the site activity. They will also act as a sentinel should a plume be detected by the downgradient monitoring wells. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 176 A number of monitoring wells were installed at the Project to collect base line data for the EIA Application. These monitoring wells will continue to exist until they get decommissioned ahead of the construction of the various mine components or get destroyed during mining. These existing monitoring wells will be considered for monitoring to establish background groundwater conditions, some of them being upgradient of the receptors. All of the additional wells proposed for the groundwater monitoring program and other programs (i.e., Aquatic Monitoring Program) will be installed ahead of the commencement of mining operations and will be sampled to collect baseline water level and chemistry data. A few locations proposed as part of the Aquatic Monitoring Progr am are already planned to be located upgradient of the receptors and wil l provide background information upgradient of the Project, as well. Information collected at these wells will be reviewed and incorporated to the groundwater monitoring program. REFERENCES CLU-IN. 2020.

Consultant Report #6, Appendix A3 - Instream Flow Assessment. (CIAR #44). Fifth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. Response to Information Request 207. (CEAR #69). Eighth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. AERR26 and AER R27. (CIAR #89). Tenth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. Response to Information Requests 5.16 and 5.29. ( CIAR #251). In the response to IR calculated weekly Q80 flows for Blairmore and Gold creeks using the Alberta Desktop Method. These flows were provided in Table 5.16- 1. Without the details of Benga 's computation and the data used by Benga, it is difficult to fully assess Benga's response. Furthermore, in the response to IR 5.16, Benga suggested that there are \"high uncertainties associated with applying a provincial- scale desktop- based instream flow needs assessment method\" such as the Alberta Desktop Method. Benga proposes to use the field-based method associated with their instream flow assessment (IFA) executed as part of Appendix A3 of Consultant Report #6 (CIAR #44). However, Benga's IFA Assessm ent in Consultant Report #6 did not provide instream flow needs (IFN) numbers, and in the response to IR 207 (CIAR #69), when AER requested IFNs, Benga stated that, \"the intent of the IFA was to assess this potential impact of changes in flow, and not to provide an IFN number \". The Panel wants to review weekly IFN flows for Blairmore and Gold Creek based on Benga's IFA. In response to IR 5.16 b (ii), Benga described 'Delta Water' and expects Alberta (AEP) Delta Stormwater Availab ility Tool (DWAT) would be available for application to the Project. However, the Panel understands that the DWAT is a decision support tool and not an operational hydrologic model. DWAT is also still under development to support an AEP policy that is in the draft stage and has not been finalised. In Addendum 10, Benga proposed a flow augmentation calculation and suggest ed that the formula be accepted in principle, and the specific calculations for this project be developed before project start-up as per the AEP Delta Water policy. However, in order for the Panel to properly assess potential risks to the streams due to the Project, the flow augmentation calculations need to be presented in detail. As highlighted in IR 6.17, there is a potential conflict betw een Benga's ability to release treated water while also retaining water that does not meet discharge limits on site for further treatment. As such, the details of return flow criteria need to be determined at this stage rather than during the operation pha se, since the feasibility of water returns is an important part of the Panel's review with respect to the Water Act . BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 178 The information requested below is required in order to complete the following: Terms of Reference, Section 3.2.6.1 [A]: \"Describe the wate r supply requirements for the project, including (f) the expected cumulative effects on water losses/gains resulting from the project operations. Terms of Reference, Section 3.2.6.2 [C]: \"Describe discharges to the watershed from existing and reclaimed sites, including potential end- pit lakes, and the management strategy for handling such releases\". The Panel requests Benga provide weekly IFN flows for Blairmore and Gold Creeks, and develop a detailed flow augmentation calculation. An example of a flow augm entation methodology that would satisfy this request is included below. a) Present IFN flows for Blairmore and Gold Creeks in weekly timesteps for a full calendar year. In addition, provide the exact latitude and longitude, or LSD location, for each comput ed IFN value. Benga may base these IFN flows on the Instream Flow Assessment completed as part of Consultant Report #6 (CIAR #44). Explain each step of the derivation of weekly IFN flows in detail using the results of the Instream Flow Assessment. Response: Instream Flow Needs (IFN) flows are provided in weekly timesteps for a full calendar year, in Figure 6.13-1 and Figure 6.13-2 for Gold Creek and Blairmore Creek respectively, for each macrohabitat study reach defined in the Instream Flow Assessment (IFA) (Addendum 1, CR#6, Appendix A3, CIAR#44) and near the mouth of each creek (at downstream hydrometric stations outside of the st udy reaches). Table 6.13-1 defines the latitude and longitude locations of these reach breaks and station locations. As request ed by the JRP, these data were calculated using the Alberta Desktop Method (ADM) (Locke and Paul 2011) as follows, which assumes IFN represent the greater of: a 15% instantaneous reduction from natural flow; or the lesser of either the natural flow or the 80% exceedance natural flow based on a weekly or monthly time step. Daily long- term synthetic streamflow time -series, spanning the period from 1975-2016, were developed for these sites and further upstream based on methods outlined in the IFA report (Addendum 1, CR#6, Appendix A3, sub-appendix A1, CIAR#44). These data were used to characterize the baseline period and were averaged weekly for purposes of calculating the 'natural' flows using the ADM (i.e., prior to any mine -capture or release of water). No te that natural flows, and the resulting IFN values generally increase further downstream except for Reach 6 on Gold Creek (near Lille; Addendum NING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 179 These va lues were then reduced by 15% (Section 4.4.1, Locke and Paul 2011), and for each week an 80% exceedan ce va lue was calculated (i.e., the flow equaled or exceeded 80% of the time, or every four years in five) for each weekly timestep. This 80% exceedance value represents the 'Ecosystem B ase F low' or E BF, Section 4.4.2 of the ADM. The final step combined the greate r of eithe r: (a) a 15% instantaneous reduction from natural flow, and (b) the lesse r of either the natura l flow or the EBF on a weekly timestep (Section 4.4.3, Locke and Paul 2011). Figures 6.13-3 and 6.13-4 provide an illustrative comparison of each calculation step, for each week, on Gold and B lairmore Creek, respectively (equivalent t o Figure 8 and Figure 9 within the ADM) Appendix 6.13-1 provides calculations and Q80 values . The IFN curve included on each graph indica tes the change i n IFN flow across f low exceedan ce values (i.e., at natural f low below the EBF, at EBF values thereafter u ntil f ollowing 15% natural flow reductions once above the EBF). Values in Figure 6.13-1 and 6.13-2 represent the a verage o f IFN values calculated for th e range of flow values ( exceedances) for a given weekly timestep (e.g., as shown for the hydrometric station locations in Figure 6.13-3 and 6.13-4). Table 6.13- 1 Locations Related to IFN Calculations on Gold and Blairmore Creek Creek Location Latitude (decimal degrees) Longitude (decimal degrees) Blairmore Creek Reach 5 49.716 -114.462 Reach 4 Reach -114.401 Note: Locations shown are at the upper reach breaks in each instance, except for hydrometric station gauges near the mouth downstream of the LSA macroreaches applied in the AEA/IFA. As the JRP has noted, a detailed, (field-based) IFA was completed to improve confidence of predicting potential adverse alterations to westslope cutthroat (WSCT) habitat, specifically in the upper and mid-catchments of Blairmore and Gold creeks. The methodology associated with the IFA is a more precise hydraulic- habitat approach that more reliably predicts actual changes in stream hydraulics and associated changes habitat su itability/quantity for the target species (such as WSCT). Similar to a flow -based threshold, this IFA and other Alberta field -based studies (e.g., Clipperton et al. 2003) assumed the threshold for \"no significant\" effects to fish due to BENGA MI NING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 180 predicted flow cha nges was a <10% reduction in total habitat area for relevant biological stanzas. In average or wet hydrological conditions, all habitat losses predicted as part of the Grassy Mountain Project (stanza -averaged values for various Project phases) are predict ed to be small and within the <10% flow reduction range. Only during extreme dry conditions, when habitat is naturally most stressed, did these reductions reach the 10% threshold (to a maximum of 11% under drought conditions). Using either a (10%) flow-based or habitat -based threshold, the risk to WSCT are low under nearly all flow scenarios thr oughout the proposed mine life. b) Provide a flow augmentation methodology, including, for each part, detailed and complete description and formulation of: i.how Benga would operationally determine how much water would be prevented from flowing to each of Gold Creek and Blairmore Creek due to the capturing of water within the Project footprint; ii.how Benga would operationally determine the natural flow in each of Gold Creek and Blairmore Creek; and iii.how the results of (i) and (ii) above would be used to operationally calculate the minimum daily release volume to meet the requirements of the Alberta Desktop Method, or another similar Instream Flow Needs methodology. Response: In consideration of IFN, and any water management actions (such as flow augmentation) required to meet these IFN, it is important to summarize the direction and magnitude of runoff changes as predicted by the Project's Water and Load Balance model. The capture and collection of surface water runoff and groundwater as part of the Project's proposed water management plan is predicted to result in a slight reduction in flow in Gold Creek, while increasing flow in Blairmore Creek, relative to b aseline flows in each system. The relative changes to Gold and Blairmore creeks are illustrated in Figures 43 -45 and Figures 46-48 of the Hydrology Assessment (EIA, CR#4, CIAR#42), respectively, applying three hydrological scenarios (wet/average/dry). Th ese changes incorporate all of the various water management decisions including those discussed in part (b) of the IR relating to Q site and Q return. Predicted changes in flow (reductions) for Gold Creek are included in Figure 6.13-5 , (representative of Figure 43 in EIA, CR#4, CIAR#42), which demonstrates that all predicted reductions (at select nodes) will be less than 10% (with the exception of node GC-02 during mine decommissioning (2040's, when flow reductions reach 11%). Based on the above, flow augme ntation for Gold Creek is not required to meet the ADM IFN threshold (85%) given that all predicted withdrawals are well below 15%. Clearly, no flow augmentation would be required to meet the IFN values on Blairmore Creek given that flows are predicted to increase relative to baseline. Furthermore, the federal 'Framework for assessing the ecological flow requirements to support fisheries in Canada' (DFO 2013) outlines the expert BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 181 consensus that cumulative flow alterations of less than +/ - 10% of the magnitude of actual (instantaneous) flow in the river relative to a \"natural flow regime\" have a low probability of detectable negative impacts to ecosystems in Canada. The proposed flow changes on Gold Creek are almost entirely ( Figure 6.13-5) within this 0 -10% range, imply ing low risk to aquatic resources on Gold Creek. Benga further notes that under the circumstances where mine affected water does not meet discharge limits and must be retained on site for further treatment, any resulting temporary reduction i n daily water releases will only affect Blairmore Creek since the Project is designed to discharge all such treated water into Blairmore Creek. As noted above, the normal flows in Blairmore Creek will normally be increased by the Project and any such disr uption will only serve to bring flows back down to baseline levels. As such, even under upset conditions, there will be no need to augment flows to Blairmore Creek (or to Gold Creek) to meet IFN requirements. While the IFN values requested in this IR have been provided, please note that short -term mitigation measures may be considered if follow -up flow and habitat monitoring results do not align with the IFN and IFA predictions, respectively. Similarly, the predicted Project -related alterations to fish habitat under av erage conditions will be counterbalanced through the implementation of a Fisheries Offsetting Plan that aims to create a net gain of WSCT habitat in Gold Creek. After implementing these measures, the residual effects predicted from changes i n hydrology from the Project on the WCST populations are expected to be mitigated. During the Project operation, monitoring activities will be completed across all disciplines related to the health of WSCT populations and habitat quality, to ultimately confirm there are no serious, irreversible changes occurring at the population level nor any decreases in the resilience of WSCT population along the length of Gold and Blairmore creeks.

Section C. Figure C.5.3 1 to C.5.3-5. (CIAR #42). First Addendum #6; Appendix A1, Figure 4.11. Canada. (CIAR #101). Tenth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. Response to Information Request 5.20. (CIAR #251). In reviewing the locations of the discharge points from the proposed mine (Figure C.5.3-1 to Figure C.5.3-5, CIAR #42), and the respon se to IR 5.20 (CIAR #251), it appears that the Northeast sedimentation pond on Gold Creek, and the West sedimentation ponds on Blairmore Creek will be disc harging directly into high quality Westslope Cutthroat Trout spawning habitat (Figure 4.11, CIAR #44). The Northeast sedimentation pond is shown to discharge immediatel y upstream of the confluence of GCT10 with Gold Creek, in an area shown to be high quality spawning habitat with a moderate distribution of spawning adults. The West sedimentati on pond on Blairmore Creek is shown to discharge into BCT06, in an area with the highest quality spawning habitat in the LSA, as shown by the highest distri bution of spawning adults. Given the known sensitivity of Westslope Cutthroat Trout sp awning habitat to sedimentation and changes in st ream temperature, the critical nature of quality spawning habitats, and importance of protecting these habitats to meet the objectives of the \"Recovery Strategy and Action Plan for the Al berta Populations of Westslope Cutthroat Trout in Canada\"(CIAR #101), it is uncl ear why the discha rge points from the sedimentation ponds are lo cated in these areas. The information requested below is required in order to complete the following: Terms of Reference, Section 4.5.2 [A]: \" Describe the potentia l impacts to fish and fish habitat, such as stream alterations and c hanges to substrat e conditions or water quality and quantity, while considering (a) fish tainting, survival of eggs and fry, chronic or acute health effects, and increased stress on fish populations from release of contaminants, sedimentation, flow alterations, and temperature and habitat changes; and (d) changes to benthic invertebrate communities that may affect food qualityand availability for fish;\" Terms of Reference, Section 4.5.2.

EIS Guidelines, Section 6.3.3: \" include potential environmental effects to species at risk, including the direct and indirect effect s on the survival or recovery of federally listed species (e.g. Westslope Cutthroat Trout). \" a) Provide a rationale for locating the discha rge points for the Northeast Sedimentation pond and West Sedimentation pond in documen ted high quality Westslope Cutthroat Trout spawning habitat. Response: The locations of the water management infrastr ucture features were based on existing natural drainage patterns associated with the current topography of Grassy Mountain during the conceptual engineering design. b) Discuss the feasibility of relocating th e discharge points of the sedimentation ponds downstream of documented Westslope Cutth roat Trout spawning habitat to avoid potential effects to Westslope Cutthroat Trout. Response: Benga does not consider it to be beneficial or ne cessary to relocate the discharge points of the sedimentation ponds for the following reasons: Moving these discharges downstream will unnecessarily alter the natural flow regime. The area of the current discharges has not been identified as \"high quality Westslope Cutthroat Trout spawning habita t\" as suggested in the Rationale for this WSCT Spawning Survey (Section referenced Figure 4.11, clearly states that \"Spawning was not geographically concentrated, but rather sp read throughout reaches and based on habitat availability.\" The information provided in Figure 4.11 (CIAR #44) represented theobservations of mature WSCT within thos of the wa tercourses during the spawning bio-period assessment.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 184 The spawning grounds of WSCT in both Blairmore Creek and Gold Creek likely vary between years as habitat features in these small, high gradient streams isdynamic in nature (Section 4.1.4, Appendix A1, CR#6, CIAR #44 ). As the spawning habitat may occur in different locations within both watercourses each year, any shift of a sedimentation discharge point will not necessarily avoid spawning habitat. Temperature effects from the proposed se dimentation pond discharges have been assessed to be not significant. In the response to JRP IR6.15, Benga clearly documents that the relative contributions of the sedimentation ponds to the receiving watercourses is low (3% for NESP and 5% for WSP). Stream temperatures in keyWSCT bioperiods are predicted to change ma rginally at the immediate (local) mixing zones but will remain at or near the optim al temperature range for the species. There will be no appreciable sediment ation in the creeks caused by the sedimentation pond discharges. The sedimentation ponds are designed to collect non- disturbed catchment surface water run-off and, as part of the water management plan, pit water (not exposed to waste rock piles). The sedimentation ponds will be designedto settle total suspended solids (TSS) prior to release to either Blairmore Creek or Gold Creek. Finally, as part of the Aquatic Monitoring Plan (AMP), the overall goal of this water quality monitoring component is to eval uate effluent released from th e mine on the aquatic receiving environment of Blairmore Creek and verify that contact water from the mine does not adversely influence Gold Creek. The AMP (updated for JRP IR-6.23 ) water released from the sedimentation ponds will be monitored to assess the effectiveness of the associated sedimentation pond mitigations. c) On a map displaying water management infrastructure and discharge locations (similar to Figure C.5.3-5), display wher e the current discharge locations are and where alternative discharge locations could be located. On the same map, include alayer that displays spawning habitat suitability. Response: Figure 6.14-1 displays the water management infrastru cture discharge locations and observed spawning habitat only. Based on the rationale presented in part B of this response, Benga is not considering alternative discharge locations for the id entified sedimentation ponds. d) Provide a supporting rationale for the pr oposed alternative discharge locations. In determining appropriate discharge locations for water management infrastructure, Benga should calculate the zone of infl uence for sedimenta tion and temperature associated with the discharge to protect sensitive habitats downstream of the pointsof discharge. Response: As discussed in part b) of this response, Benga is not considering altern ative discharge locations for the sedimentation ponds. At the proposed discharge locations, potential effects due to changes in total suspended sediment and wate r temperature have been assessed to be not significant for spawning. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 185 Information Request 6.15 Environmental Impact Assessment. Appendix 10b - Water and Load Balance Model. (CIAR #42). First Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. Consultant Report #6; Appendix A4. (CIAR #44). Comments from Jim the Ktunaxa Nation Council. (CIAR #178). from Tsuut'ina Nation. (CIAR #192). Information Request Package #5 from the Joint Review Panel to Benga, Information Request 5.20. (CIAR #215). Tenth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. Response to Information Request 5.20. (CIAR #251). In IR 5.20 (CIAR #215), Benga was directed to provide an assessment of the proportion of flow that each water management structure contributed to the baseflow at the point of discharge in order to assess the potential impacts these water management structures may have on the receiving aquatic ecosystem. In the response to IR 5.20 (CIAR #251), Benga stated that the proportion of creek baseflows sourced from the Project's water management infrastructure developments were negligible at the mouth of Gold Creek at WSC Station 05AA0030 (i.e., 2.4%). The proportion of creek baseflow sourced from the Project's water management infrastructure near the mouth of Blairmore Creek at hydrometric station BC-H01 were estimated at 23.2% (annual average). In the response to IR 5.20, Benga considered that the Water and Load Balance Model and the System for Environmental Flow Assessment (SEFA) model accounted for the discharge contributions from the Project's water management infrastructure developments and provided a reasonable prediction of temperature fluctuations. Those predictions were also presented in Addendum 1, Consultant Report #6, Appendix A4 (CIAR #44) and were considered by Benga to be not significant. Benga's assessment considered the contributions from the water management structures at the watershed scale, concluding that discharge from sedimentation ponds represented 0.1% of baseflow in Blairmore Creek, and 0.2% of baseflow in Gold Creek. This watershed scale assessment was used to support the conclusion that contributing flows from the sediment ponds and the End Pit Lake would not result in significant changes to water temperatures in Blairmore Creek or Gold Creek, based on the outputs from the Water and Load Balance Model, and the SEFA Model. However, by assessing the potential impacts on stream temperatures as a result of discharging flows from sediment pond structures and the End Pit Lake at a watershed scale, Benga did not provide the requested assessment as described in 5.20 a) through f), which requested an assessment of the impacts to stream temperatures and potential changes to habitat suitability at a mesohabitat scale. Several submissions highlighted that, given the sensitivities of BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 186 Westslope C utthroat Trout to potential changes in water temperature, localized potential changes in stream temperature at the mesohabitat scale should be quantified (CIAR #133, #178 and #192). Furthermore, given the location and the identified high productivity spawn ing habitat that is present in the immediate area and downstream of the discharge location (as discussed in IR 6.14), elevated temperatures during summer months could represent a potential risk to habitat suitability and reduced temperatures during the spring spawning season could represent a potential risk to spawning success in both Gold and Blairmore creeks. The information requested in IR 5.20 is required to consider potential effects to stream temperatures and habitat suitability for the various Westsl ope Cutthroat Trout bioperiods at the mesohabitat scale. This response should also consider any alternative proposed discharge locations, as discussed in IR 6.14. The information requested below is required in order to complete the sections of the Terms of Reference and EIS Guidelines referenced in IR 6.14 (above). Provide the information initially requested in IR 5.20 a) through f) in consideration of the potential effects at the mesohabitat scale, and not at a watershed scale. a)Provide an update d assessment discussing the proportion of base flow that each sediment pond, surge pond, and discharge point from the saturated backfill zone represents at the confluence of the water management structure's discharge outlet in both Gold Creek or Blairmore Creek (depending on which stream is receiving the discharge) in order to accurately assess the zone of influence of these water management structures on changes in stream temperatures. Response: Figure 6.15-1 provides updated values of water releases occurring fro m the Project as predicted by the Project's Water and Load Balance (EIA 2016, Appendix 10b, CIAR#42). This includes the three treated water discharge locations on Blairmore Creek (at nodes BC -07, BL-02 and BC-03), and the four sedimentation ponds with two on Blairmore Creek (Plant Site Sedimentation Pond [PSSP] and West Sedimentation Pond [WSP]) and two on Gold Creek (East Sedimentation Pond [ESP] and North East Sedimentation Pond [NESP]). Releases are far higher through the three discharge locations on Blairmore Creek, than through the sedimentation ponds on either creek, as indicated in the Water and Load Balance Model (EIA 2016, Appendix 10b, CIAR#42). Corresponding creek flow predictions, to calculate the percentage contributions from ESP, NESP, PSSP and WSP, were at nodes GC -04, GC-10, BC-03 and BC-07, respectively. The natural creek flows were calculated using the range of flow variability gauged within a long- term historical baseline period (1 975-2016) and synthesized to the various Project reaches and model nodes. Both creek flows and discharges from all features are calculated on a total flow basis (i.e., may include any losses through the gravels, etc.) used in the Water and Load Balance model. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 187 The Project discharges were available at an annual time -step. For the purposes of this IR, the discharges from each pond were calculated assuming that all runoff from the pond sub-catchments was collected by the pond itself. This assumption is cons ervatively high as some water will be captured as contac t water and sent to the saturated backfill zone (SBZ) depending on the state of mine development. The model also conservatively assumes the ponds exist into mine closure (after Year 27), when actually the ponds will be remediated during this period. On an annual basis, maximum pond contributions to the creek at the confluence were 2%, 2%, 1% and 8% at ESP, NESP, PSSP and WSP, respectively. If the pond releases were assumed to occur constantly year -round, maximum proportions on a monthly basis would be 4%, 5%, 2% and 13%, respectively. Of the three discharges from the SBZ, the maximum absolute and relative contributions to Blairmore Creek were highest further upstream at BC -07 where natural creek flows are lower; however, these are conservatively high and assume that all water requires treatment in the SBZ before any final treatment and release to Blairmore Creek. Additionally, high values occur when the annual release volumes are coincident with a low-runoff year. On an annual basis, in the worst- case year, the SBZ releases contributed approximately half the flow at BC-07, one- third the flow at BC -03, and even less at BL-02 ( Figure 6.15-2). b)Discuss the zone of influence that these water managemen t structures have on stream temperatures using the maxim um predicted monthly water temperatures in each water management structure, extending downstream from the confluence of the water management structures' discharge outlets, to the point where stream temperatures return to background levels after mixing with water discharged from these water management structures. Response: An integrated response to part b) and d) is provided below since the same information is requested across all Project struc tures in part b) and more specifically the Northeast Sediment Pond in part d). Part a) introduced potential contributions of flows from each main water management feature to the corresponding flow at each corresponding confluence location on each creek. I t is important to reiterate that only the sedimentation ponds will ultimately discharge directly to Blairmore and Gold creeks. The surge ponds and the raw water ponds will be re- diverted to the SBZ and will not directly influence stream temperatures as further discussed below. Water detained within the SBZs is essentially analogous to groundwater with the same dampened temperature profile relative to any rapid surface runoff more likely to be at or near ambient air temperature. A small increase in tempera ture, during the transit from the SBZ through downstream treatmen t before arriving at Blairmore Creek is possible. Water temperatures within each sedimentation pond will likely increase with residence time and exposure to warming conditions during summer, and vice versa during winter. Since the heat BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 188 capacity of water is much higher than air, the temperature of the air will rise and fall much faster than pond temperature. Water temperature simulations can be modelled analogous to contaminant mixing (i.e., as a passive tracer), using the equation by Smith et al., (2001): =+ + Where m is the mass of the surface water flow (kg) per unit time, Cp is the heat capacity of water in J/(kg\u00b0C), and T is the temperature of each watercourse ( Pflow for the Project -related flow such as treated effluent or pond discharge, upstream for the reference creek flow above the confluence with P flow, and downstream for the total mix ed flow including P flow and upstream components). The heat capacity of water changes minimally ( i.e., <1%) across a wide temperature range (i.e., 2C = 4.21 J/kgC; 19C = 4.18 J/kgC), and, assuming ice does not form in the watercourse, the above equation can then be simplified to: = =+ Where and are the proportions of downstream (mixed) surface flow due to the Project- related flow, and upstream reference Blairmore Creek flow, respectively. may be considered as the temperature change immediately downstream of the confluence between these flows and assumes that further downstream, these temperature changes will decrease with additional inflow from natural groundwate r sources along the length of the creek. Continuous w ater temperature data collected from the Gold Creek watershed in 2016 is shown in Figure 6.15-3. Mid -watershed, Gold Creek streamflows increase by a factor of at least five, due to the large contributio n of flow from Caudron Creek sourced primarily from large groundwater reserves captured within the Livingstone Range ( Addendum 1, CR#6, Appendix A3, Section 3.3.1.1, CIAR#44). During 2016, the range of water temperatures monitored at Caudron Creek (statio n CC-T01, Figure 6.15-3) remained between 3 -5C until late November. This is a much smaller range than on Gold Creek above the Caudron Creek inflows (station GC-T04) where temperatures varied from near -freezing to 9.5C. Gold Creek water temperatures downstream of Caudron Cre ek (station GC -H02) remained very close to the water temperatures of Caudron Creek, with a slight increase of up to 1C during summer months due to the small influence of warmer water temperatures from upstream Gold Creek flows. For reference, daily mean air temperatures varied by over 40C, from -25C to +18C during the 2016 monitoring period. On Blairmore Creek, surface flows increase more gradually downstream (Addendum 1, CR#6, Appendix A3, Section 3.3.2.1, CIAR#44), and during a period of concurrent stream temperature monitoring from 2013-2014 ( Figure 6.15-4), slight temperature increases occ urred further BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 189 downstream (towards BL- H01) consistent with the transition to lower watershed and slightly warmer conditions. The scenarios p resented below, simulate potential changes in stream temperatures on Gold and Blairmore creeks, due to the influx of potential effluent or sedimentation pond discharge flows related to the Project. Since water temperatures within these discharges are not modelled explicitly by the Project's Water and Load Balance model, conservative assumptions related to surface flow changes and maximum water temperatures are introduced to estimate worst -case mixing and dilution zone delineation of water temperature at a mesohabitat -level at the select discharge points. Scenario 1: Blairmore Creek - addition of WTP discharges The above e quations predict that, for any given water temperature differential between and , will be highest when is highest. Table 6.15- 1 tabulates the highest predicted rates for each month of the year, taken across all future mining periods, hydrologic conditions, at BC- 07 where the Project flow contributions are highest (part a of the IR). values are assumed equivalent to current baseline -period values ( i.e., the monthly average values of daily water temperatures data shown in Figure 6.15-4). In the absence of estimates, May to October values were conservatively assumed to be equal to the monthly mean ambient air temperature, while November to Apr il values were assumed to be 2C warmer than current stream temperature, given that monthly air temperatures extend far below 0C during these months and are not suitable as surrogate water temperature data. The us e of monthly mean air temperatures to app roximate monthly values is very conservative given the relatively short exposure of water extracted from SBZs to ambient conditions; however, this approach is considered more realistic than other methods. In winter, when water potentially fre ezes above the surface, a 2 C incremental warming covers small increases that may be due to the pumping process and/or artificial warming to prevent water freezing. Ultimately, the generated year-round time- series of are considered acceptable maximum water temperatures of the treated water sought within parts (b) and (d) of the IR. Table 6.15- 1 indicates that worst -case stream temperature increase relative to baseline values will be up to 3.3C warmer at BC -07 where treated effluent enters Blairmore Creek. BC-07 is equidistant between hydrometric stations BL-H03 (upstream) and BL-H02 (downstream); predicted increases are slightly higher (0.9C higher) when applying data from BL-H03 given that water temperatures here are fractionally cooler.

BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 192 Scenario 2: Gold Creek - addition of NE SP discharge Part d) of the IR requests an analysis of potential temperature changes due to structures including the NESP further upstream on Gold Creek, next to model node GC-10. Scenario 2 calculates a temperature ch ange on Gold Creek, at GC-10 (upstream of Caudron Creek), using monthly water and air temperature values ( Figure 6.15-3) monitored close to node GC-10 during baseline ( Table 6.15- 2). Worst -case mine contributions on a monthly basis range from 2% to 5% (or 2% on an annual basis, from IR part ( a)). Table 6.15- 2 indicates that assumed mine water contributions of up to 5% only raised creek water temperatures by up to 0.2C. Discussion The worst-case temperature increases highlighted above occur on Blairmore C reek, where the effluent discharges relative to current creek discharges are far higher than any sediment pond releases anywhere on Gold and/or Blairmore Creek. The modelled effluent discharges will raise water temperatures by up to 3.3C, which is well within the natural variation of temperatures already experienced from season to season and year to year. Therefore, the temperature change caused by Project discharges is not expected to adversely influence key w estslope cutthroat trout (WSCT) bioperiods i n either Blairmore or Gold creeks and therefore do not pose a significant risk. Benga notes that the worst- case temperature scenario described by this analysis is conservative and not likely to occur for the following reasons: the assumptions used to estimate the water temperature of Project discharges are very conservative; and spatially, the temperature increases experienced will decrease almost immediately upon mixing, which is ultimately influenced by site- specific factors and as the proportion of streamflow sourced by Project treated discharges becomes increasingly less. Notwithstanding the very conservative approach used herein to model potential stream temperature changes due to the Project, as further discussed below in part e), water temperature changes in mesohabitats is predicted to experience minimal change immediately downstream of discharge points. c)Clarify how, or if, pit lake water temperatures were calculated and incorporated into the water temperature model during closure/reclamation. P rovide an assessment of the proportion of base flow that the pit lake represents to Gold Creek base flows once the flood elevation is exceeded, measured at the confl uence of the discharge outlet from the pit lake through the Northeast sediment pond, in order to accuratelyBENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 193 assess the zone of influence this discharge will have on stream temperatures within Gold Creek. Response: Water from the end pit lake as a potential source of water to Gold Creek, was presented as an option, if required in the EIA in August 2016. Subsequently, the Instream Flow Assessment (IFA) and Aquatic Ecology Effects Assessment were completed and filed in January 2017 (Addendum 1, CR#6, Appendix A3, CIAR#44). The results of the IFA indicated that there would be no need to provide water to Gold Creek from the end pit lake. Consequently, there will be no water from the end pit lake flowing into Gold Creek and no resultant temperature effect. d) D iscuss the zone of influence that the discharge from the pit lake via the Northeast sediment pond will have on stream temperatures in Gold Creek using the maximum predicted monthly water temperatures discharging from the Northeast sediment pond, extending downstream from the confluence of the Northeast sediment pond discharge outlet into Gold Creek to the point where stream temperatures return to background levels after mixing with the discharged water. Response: Please refer to Part b) of this response. e)Discuss the effects on habitat suitability for Westslope Cutthroat Trout within the zones of influence described in b) and d), and how changes in stream temperatures will impact each biological stanza of Westslope Cutthroat Trout described in the EIA. Response: With respect to potential residual effects on habitat suitability for WSCT, calculations of Area Weighted Suitability do not depend explicitly on water temperature (unlike water depth, velocity and substrate, for which individual Habitat Suitability Curves exist; Hatfield 2017). However, the preferred temperature range of WSCT is 9 to 12\u00b0C (Alberta Westslope Cutthroat Trout Recovery Team 2013) and they are rarely found in waters exceeding 22\u00b0C (Behnke and Zarn 1976). More recent work by Bear and McMahon (2007) found the upper incipient lethal temperature of WSCT is 19.6\u00b0C. During winter, when water may be at risk of freezing, warmer water is preferred by WSCT as it reduces the severity of winter conditions for WSCT (e.g., French et al. 2014). The refore, although predicted Project- related increases in stream temperature at the mesohabitat level across key bioperiods are unlikely, a slight increase in temperature during the winter months could potentially have a beneficial influence on WSCT, similar to the benefits of groundwater input. At a daily timescale, stream temperatures in both Gold and Blairmore creeks during key WSCT bioperiods are predicted to change slightly at the immediate (local) mixing zones but will not adversely influence mesohabitat conditions in the vicinity or downstream of the discharge points. Furthermore, the changes are not predicted to BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 194 exceed incipient lethal temperatures throughout the lifetime of the mine when accounting for the predicted temperature changes ( Table 6.15-1 and Table 6.15-2). At the monthly timescale, stream temperatures in mesohabitats immediately downstream of discharge points remained at or near the optimal temperature range, and several degrees lower than the incipient lethal temperatures. The modelled results provided herein align with the macro- level stream temperature modeling results that were presented in Consultant Report #6, (Addendum 1, CR#6, CIAR#44). f)Discuss technically and economically feasible mitigation and adaptive management measures t hat can be implemented to prevent and/or minimize changes in stream temperatures in Gold Creek and Blairmore Creek as a result of discharges from the water management structures discussed above. Response: Based on the analysis presented above, Benga does n ot consider that the Project will have a significant adverse effect on water temperatures in either Blairmore or Gold creeks. Temperature will be monitored in both creeks as part of the Project Fisheries and Aquatic Monitoring Plan (follow -up monitoring) and any changes outside of the modelled predictions will be noted for further action.

BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 195 SURFACE WATER QUALITY Information Request 6.16 Grassy Mountain Coal Project Updated Environmental Impact Assessment. Consultant Report #5 -Surface Water Quality. (CEAR #42). Information Request Package #5 from the Joint Review Panel to Benga, Information Request 5.1. (CIAR #215). Tenth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Statement. Response to Information Request 5.1. (CIAR #251). Comments from Timberwolf Wilderness Society. (CIAR #281). Benga did not provide the information requested in IR 5.1 a) (CIAR #215), which asked Benga to conduct an alternat ive risk assessment for selenium in the absence of sulphate as a toxicity modifying factor. In the IR response (CIAR #251), Benga indicated that sulphate mitigation of selenate uptake by algae has been known for decades, and suggests exclusion of sulphate mitigation in selenium guidelines is a result of inadequate paired data or lag time for regulations to catch up with the science. The Timberwolf Wilderness Society (CIAR #281) comments noted that median sulphate concentrations were utilized by Benga when determining ameliorating effects of sulphate on selenium toxicity. The comments also noted that the sulphate concentrations presented in Consultant Report #5, Figure 6 (CIAR #42), are highly variable, and leave large room for error if only one point (e.g. median) is taken to characterize that parameter for any one time period. Using the median concentration, predicted sulphate concentrations are likely overestimated 50% of the time, and the ameliorating effects of sulphate may be overestimated during those t imes. It is important for the Panel to understand what effect an overestimation of predicted sulphate concentrations would have on a site-specific selenium guideline which is, in part, based on sulphate concentrations. a)Provide additional details on how seasonal variations in sulphate concentrations were accounted for in development of the proposed site- specific selenium guideline. Response: The site -specific selenium guideline developed for the Project (Water Quality Consultant Report CR#5, Appendix A1, CIAR#42) is sulphate-dependent: SSWQG = 0.594\u00d7SO 4 This site-specific guideline was developed through tests with site- collected waters and using a range of sulphate concentrations predicted to encompass future site conditions. However, both sulphate and selenium concentrations in the receiving environment will vary seasonally, which will introduce seasonal variation to the proposed site -specific guideline and to ambient selenium concentrations that are compared with it. The following provides additional information on the BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 196 protectiveness of the site -specific guideline relative to predicted seasonal variability in sulphate (and selenium) concentrations. The protectiveness of this site -specific guideline equation relative to selenium bioaccumulation and toxicity to westslope cutthroat trout (WSCT) was previo usly evaluated based on mean sulphate and concentrations 529 mg/L and 6.8 \u00b5g/L from post-mine closure modelling. To support with this IR, monthly predictions of selenium and sulphate concentrations from January 2017 through December 2099 at BC-07 were evaluated in order to further understand the influence of varying sulphate and selenium concentrations (a total of 996 paired sulphate and selenium predictions). The same selenium bi oaccumulation model previously described was used for this evalu ation. The predicted sulphate and selenium concentrations from 2017 2099 covary, as (Graph A, Figure 6.16-1 ). Consequently, the sulphate-dependent selenium guideline also var ies with predicted selenium concentrations (Graph B, Figure 6.16-1). During times when the sulphate-dependent selenium guideline is lower due to low sulphate concentrations, the predicted selenium concentration is also lower. The result is that predicted selenium concentrations are always less than the site -specific guideline (over all of the time periods modelled, the maximum selenium -to-guideline ratio is 0.83 and the average ratio is 0.50). In addition to predicted water selenium concentrations always being less than the sulphate - dependent guideline, predicted sel enium concentrations in WSCT from the bioaccumulation model continue to be less than the WSCT trout EC10 of 24.8 mg/kg dw based on the most conservative bioaccumulation model ( Figure 6.16-2). In Figure 6.16- 2, there are some conspicuous spikes and dips where the predicted WSCT egg selenium concentrations increase while the predicted surface water selenium concentrations decrease, and vice versa. This occurs because sulphate is correlated with selenium. When the predicted selenium concentration decreases the sulphate concentration likewise decreases, which results in higher selenium bioavailability predictions by the model. This explains why predicted WSCT egg selenium concentrations are not highly variable among all years of the model. In summary, consideration of seasonal (monthly) variability in sulphate concentrations continues to predict that the sulphate -dependent selenium guideline will not be exceeded by predicted surface water seleniu m concentrations and that modelled selenium concentrations in WS will not egg selenium EC10. Information Request 6.17 Fifth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. Response to Information Request 86. (CIAR #69) Comments from Tsuut'ina Nation. (CIAR #220). BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 197 Tenth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. Response to Information Request 5.1, 5.3, 5.5, and 5.16. (CIAR #251). Comments from Victor and Barbara Koch. (CIAR #275). A general theme put forth by Benga throughout multiple information request responses was that if water does not meet regulatory limits for release to the receiving environment, it will be pumped back instead of being released. In the response to IR 5.3 (CIAR #251), Benga stated \"water not meeting the proposed effluent limit would be pumped to the raw water pond (RWP) for reuse in the CHPP (coal handling and processing plant) or to an SBZ (saturated backfill zone) and re -treated. Pump- back to the RWP or an SBZ is the general contingency plan for effluent that exceeds any effluent quality limit.\" This contingency measure (holding and recycling for re- treatment) is further confirmed in responses to IRs 5.1, 5.3, 5.5, as well as in response to previous rounds of information requests, and is Benga's proposed approach for off- spec water from saturated backfill zones and sedimentation ponds. Benga noted in response to IR 5.5, that the time from planning to implementation of a fully functional selenium treatment plant would take three years. As highlighted by Benga in the response to IR 86 (CIAR #69), saturated backfill zones are expected to treat an estimated 4.5 M m3/year, or approximately 12,300 m3/day (in line with estimated daily volumes to be treated via a treatment plant, if needed, between 11,000 and 20,000 m3/day). While it is likely that other contingency measures to treat elevated selenium concentrations could be implemented prior to the 3-year time period, all proposed alternative treatment methods (e.g. gravel bed bioreactors) would take several weeks or months to become operational, during which time off-spec water would need to be held on site and further treated. Tsuut'ina Nation (CIAR #220) expressed concerns regarding the length of time it would take for the alternative treatment methods to become operational. Victor and Barbara Koch (CIAR #275) expressed concerns regarding whether the raw water pond would be big enough to hold the off- spec water until adjustments are made. In the response to IR 5.16 b)(ii), Benga proposed a flow augmentation methodology to determine the minimum water release rates to Blairmore and Gold Creeks to meet Instream Objectives required under their potential Water Act licence. If water quality does not meet regulatory limits under the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (EPEA) approval and is held back for further treatment, it may not be possible for Benga to achieve the required Instream Objectives. Conversely, if Benga proposes to meet Instream Objectives as required under a Water Act licence, it may not be feasible for Benga to hold back water that does not meet EPEA regulatory limits for further treatment. a) Describe how Benga would meet the minimum release rates required under the Water Act licence conditions to meet the Instream Objectives for Blairmore Creek and Gold Creek when water does not meet EPEA regulatory limits and is proposed to be held on site for further treatment, and during any other time such as during maintenance of the saturated backfill zone when water is required to be held on site. In cludeBENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 198 discussion of other potential sources of water (i.e. surface water sedimentation ponds) that could be used to ensure that Instream Objectives are met. Response: As outlined in the Instream Flow Assessment (IFA) (Addendum 1, CR#6, Appendix A3, Section 2.2, CIAR#44), Section 2.2 integrates the results of the Water and Load Balance Model for the Project. The results indicate that flows in Blairmore Creek are expecte d to increase relative to baseline conditions as a result of the additional contribution of flow from some Gold Creek sub -catchments ( e.g., as a result of the overall all water and selenium management plan, which has the treatment of effluent discharging a t three nodes on Blairmore Creek [BC-07, BL-02, and BC-03] and not to Gold Creek), and due to the estimated increase in runoff caused by changes to the hydrological characteristics of developed mine areas ( i.e., increase in runoff coefficients for pit wall s and waste rock areas) (EIA, Appendix 10B, 10C, and 10D within Appendix 10B: Water and Load Balance, CIAR#42). If through operational monitoring the saturated backfill zones (SBZ) are deemed to be operating ineffectively for a period of time and there is a requirement to retain water on -site rather than release to the environment, this would serve to reduce the Blairmore Creek flows simulated downstream of each discharge node, during the period of SBZ shutdown; however, the flows would still be higher th an current baseline flows as a result of the Project's Water Management Plan and Water Balance. On Blairmore Creek, with the SBZ operating under normal design standards, very small increases in suitable habitat area ('Area Weighted Suitability' [AWS]) wer e predicted and displayed in Table 4-4 to Table 4-6 of the IFA (Addendum 1, CR#6, Appendix A3, CIAR#44). These three tables, (one each for various hydrologic conditions; downstream of the northwest surge pond to about 1 km below the BLT- 04 tributary), ind icate averaged improvements along the length of Blairmore Creek were up to 4% depending on the fish bio-period and hydrologic condition. With a portion of the incremental flows removed ( i.e., due to SBZ shutdown), these improvements (increases) in habitat area would only reduce slightly, and the AWS would still be higher than current baseline AWS values. With respect to the instream objectives for Gold Creek; the IFA outlined that due to catchment modifications there would not be a significant reduction on overall flows within the adjacent reaches of Gold Creek. Since the retention of water o n-site is only as a result of SBZ shutdown or ineffectiveness in meeting environmental guidelines, and there is no anticipated releases from that system to Gold Creek, there would not be any change to the Gold Creek flows related to this retention of water. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 199 b) Provide details on the anticipated capacity that Benga has included in the water handling system associated with the raw water pond and saturated backfill zone, specifically: i.Anticipated capacity of the raw water pond for pump back water and discus sion of how many days of typical water release this would represent; Response: The Raw Water Pond (RWP) has been designed with a capacity of 1,200,000 m3. During the first 10 years of operation, water extraction from the SBZ is anticipated to be 12,000 m3/d on average with 18,000 m3/d peak flow rates. It is likely that the RWP will be operated at a level which allows for the anticipated inflow design flood (IDF ) for the RWP under CDA regulations which is approximately 664,000 m3. Under this operating condition, the surge capacity within the RWP would allow recycle at the peak extraction rate for approximately 37 days and at the average extraction rate for 55 days. After year 10 of operation, an additional 900,000 m3 of SBZ volume will be made available (Addendum 2, Appendix 1D, Table 3.2.1, CIAR#53). If significant recycle to the RWP is still being experienced at this time, additional pumps can be installed to recycle directly back to the SBZ where the additional volume will be sufficient to ensure adequate retention time. ii.Anticipated pumping capacity to be installed and redundancy (i.e. contingency plans in the event of pump failure); Response: The Project's water management infrastructure will be designed with pumping capacity to meet the conditions of both average flow and peak flow demand. For the first 10 years of operation , pumping systems for transfer of water from the Southeast surge pon ds to the RWP and from the RWP to the saturated backfill zones (SBZ) will accommodate the anticipated peak flow rates through the use of three pumps, each designed to discharge at 250 m 3/hr for a total capacity of 18,000 m3/d. This will allow flexibility to address varying flow conditions as well as redundancy of 1 pump (under average conditions) should a pump require servicing and maintenance. In addition, the extraction wells within the SBZ will be designed with the same design criteria of three pumps at 50% as well as the pumps that will convey water from the 24-hour buffer pond to the final clean water pond. As more experienced is gained with the operation of the SBZs in conjunction with the RWP, and especially after year 10 when additional SBZ capacity becomes available, additional pumps can be added to the operation as required to ensure sufficient pumping capacity. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 200 iii.Any other ponds or water structures that could be used to store water that does not meet EPEA specifications while more permanent treatment measures are developed; and As indicated in the E IA (Addendum 2, Appendix 1D, Table 3.2.1, CIAR#53), the volume of the SBZ will grow dramatically after year 10 of operations when 900,000 m3 of additional SBZ volume will become available and again at EOM, a total of nearly 7 million m3 of SBZ volume will be available. After year 10, with the additional SBZ volume available, i t is anticipated that the SBZ volume will itself serve as backup storage capacity. As an interim measure, if additional water storage is required, a temporary holding pond can be constructed in the mined pit. iv.How off-spec water would be stored, treated, and discharged during the 3- year period that would be needed to construct a selenium treatment plant, in the event that it would be required. Response: As discussed at length in JRP IR-6.25, even under scenarios where the SBZ does not perform as predicted in the EIA, selenium levels are not forecast to exceed the proposed selenium guideline in Blairmore Creek, until at least 10 years after the start of operations. This is based on the fact that, the rate of selenium leaching will be proportional to the amount of rock stored in the rock dump, which will increase through the years with mine activity. In addition, there is a delay between placement of rock in the waste rock disposal an d presence of selenium in the affected water du e to the time required for the rock to be wetted. During these 10 years after mine start -up, Benga will be monitoring the selenium removal rates in the SBZ as well as selenium concentrations in the surge ponds, raw water pond, and in Blairmore Creek. If there is an indication that removal rates will not achieve the targeted levels of selenium removal or that selenium concentrations in untreated water are higher than expected, Benga will have several years to r esolve the situation through operational adjust ments to the SBZ or to implement another contingency plan to prevent unacceptably high selenium levels in Blairmore Creek. Given this long timeframe between the indication of a potential problem and reaching unacceptable selenium concentrations, Benga wil l be able to implement its contingency plans without having to store years of contaminated water. If for some reason an urgent and unforeseen situation were to arise, Benga would take short term measures that may include: maximize storage in the RWP and ot her surge ponds; construction of a GBR (approximately one year to implement assuming design is done in advance); construction of temporary holding pond within the mined pit; and early implementation of additional SBZ phases.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 201 Information Request 6.18 Tenth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. Response to Information Request 5.6. (CIAR #251). In response to IR 5.6 d) (CIAR #251), Benga introduced the concept of using gravel bed bioreactors for the removal of selenium from surface water as a contingency measure. Benga supported this proposal by providing case studies, but provided no information on design and treatment effectiveness for selenium removal that would be relevant to the proposed mine site. Table 5.5-1 provided a high- level overview of gravel bed construction indicating this would occur over construction years five and six. Additional details on the treatment process, sizing, design parameters, location, equipment configuration, reagent (or additive) requirements, pre- and post- treatment requirements, and contingency plans in the event of delays in emergency commissioning and operationalization have not been provided. Provide the following additional details as relates to gravel bed reactors: a) Description of treatment process; Response: A Gravel Bed Reactor (GBR) consists of an engineered bed of gravel/media through which water containing constituents of concern ( e.g., nitrate and selenium) is passed for treatment. Electron donors are added to the water at the inlet of the GBR to promote the growth and activity of natural microbes that are capable of reducing the nitrate to nitrogen gas, and the selenium species (typica lly selenate and selenite) to elemental selenium, which becomes immobile in the gravel bed. The addition of electron donors to the influent water promotes the development of appropriate geochemical conditions that result in the biological reduction of sel enate (SeVI) and selenite (SeIV), the predominant oxidized forms present in surface waters, to elemental selenium (Se0). Elemental selenium precipitates within the GBR media and is retained both within the biomass and as solid surface precipitates. The b iological treatment mechanisms for nitrate and selenium reduction are well documented in literature (Sobolewski Zhang and Frankenberger 2005; Knotek et al., 2010; USDIBR, 2011; and al., 2014). The nitrate- and selenium -reducing bacteria that mediate the biological reactions are naturally found in geographically diverse, pristine and contaminated waters (Nancharaiah and Lens, 2015). Figure 6.18-1 shows a schematic design of a typical GBR system and the treatment process. GBRs are generally constructed within a natural depression or constructed cell near the water requiring treatment. The top and bottom of the treatment zone are lined using synthetic membranes to prevent water escape/influx and ensure hydraulic isolation from the surrounding environment. The bed is filled with gravel (or crushed waste rock) of a consistent size (typically 0.75 to 2 inch), with fines removed to promote predictable flow within the GBR. A top liner and insulating layer (e.g., additional rock or soil) can then be installed as needed to maintain the temperature and prevent leakage, diffusion of air and infiltration of water into the GBR. A BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 202 buffer pond is in some cases used to aerate and retain ef fluent water before it is returned to the receiving environment. Operation of a GBR requires pumping of the source water through the gravel bed, or in some cases, gravity can be used to move source water that may be located at a higher elevation, through a GBR. Liquid carbon amendment ( i.e., electron donor such as methanol, citric acid, etc.) is added as the electron donor to the water in the GBR influent. The initial target concentration of the electron donor is selected based on the concentration of ele ctron acceptors in the source water, most notably oxygen and nitrate. The electron donor dosing is optimized based on monitoring of water chemistry in the GBR to achieve reduction of nitrate and selenium, while minimizing the potential for sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. During start- up, source water and electron donor are recirculated within the GBR to establish an active biofilm on the surface of the gravel media. Carbon utilization and establishment of anaerobic conditions are monitored, and electron donor dose is adjusted as needed. Once robust treatment of the nitrate and selenium is observed in the GBR, the unit is run in continuous forward flow, with the treated water aerated and discharged to the appropriate receiving water body. Examples o f applications of the GBR technology for the treatment of selenium include: A full scale GBR implemented to effectively reduce selenium concentrations in surface water from approximately 40 \u00b5g/L to less than 5 \u00b5g/L over an operating period ofnearly eight years, to meet the requirements of Irvine Ranch Water District's (IRWD's) Nitrogen and Selenium Management Program (Manci 2019; Geosyntec 2010) (Appendix 6.18-1). Sodium benzoate was used as the electron donor. Treatment flows in the GBR varied between 890 to 1500 m 3/day, with temperatures as low as 12 \u00baC, and achieved selenium removal rates ranging from 44 to 15 2 \u00b5g/L/d. Prior to full scale implementation, treatability and column studies were conducted by Geosyntec toconfirm biological reduct ion of selenium and provide design parameters for the GBR. During start -up operations, Geosyntec evaluated the selenium and nitrogen treatment performance of the system, involving the approximation of plug- flow characteristics, sequestration of selenium, treatment of fecal indicator bacteria, and re -oxygenation of water prior to discharge. Testing occurred over extended durations, allowed for thecharacterization of short and mid-term operational conditions, and used extensive andvaried testing protocols that informed the optimal operational conditions. A GBR implemented to treat selenium in seeps and surface water at a coal mine in WestVirginia (Mancini et al., 2019; Geosyntec 2010) (Appendix 6.18- 1). The GBR was installed beneath a parking lot at the facility to accommodate limited available space. The GBR successfully reduced selenium concentrations from approximatel y 25 \u00b5g/L to less than 5 \u00b5g/L over an operating period of about one year, with temperatures as low as13 \u00baC, using citric acid as the electron donor. Treatment flows in the GBR ranged from270 to 550 m 3/d, and selenium removal rates ranged from 25 to 42 \u00b5 g/L/day.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 203 A bench scale column test of the GBR technology for the treatment of selenium and nitrate under varying operational conditions is currently being conducted by Geosyntec, and includes the following experimental set-up, testing and preliminary findi ngs: Waste rock from the Benga site was used to pack the column using rock fragments ranging from 2 to 4 cm in size, as commonly used i n GBRs. Synthetic water containing approximately 150 \u00b5g/L and 40 mg/L NO 3-N, which represents the anticipated mine water chemistry, and amended to represent thebackground geochemistry of the site's surface water in terms of anions, cations, etc. , was used in the column test (given that Se -impacted water is not yet being generated at the site). The column has been operated for over 12 months, testing varying conditions such as temperature to as low as 4 \u00baC, influent nitrate concentrations from 40 to 200 mg/L, influent selenium concentrations from 150 to 1000 \u00b5g/L, and varying hydraulic residence time. Preliminary results f rom the column study indicate that the GBR column can maintain a zero order nitrate removal rate of 20 to 188 mg/L/day and selenium removal rate of 6 to 278 \u00b5g/L/day at temperatures ranging from 4 to 8 C and at influent concentrations ofup to 200 mg/L a nd 1,000 \u00b5g/L for nitrate and selenium, respectively. These rates are consistent with and within the range of rates we have seen in ot her in-situ bioreactors. Other field applications or field observations of successful microbially -mediated selenium reduc tion, including similar biogeochemical processes limited to: Saturated backfilled pits (Heffernan et al., 2010); gravel- and organic- References are provided in Appendix 6.18-1. b) Planned equipment location (including location on a map) i n relation to site topography, depth to groundwater; Response: The major infrastructure and equipment planned for the GBR include a GBR reactor, GBR operations building area and a buffer pond. The GBR operations building area contains an influent heater a nd ehouse (power house, trailer to house control panels, and ancillary equipment for system control); a building to contain chemical dosing systems, chemical storage, sampling area, transfer tank, and reject transfer tank; and a buffer pond. The Phase 1 region of the mined BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 204 pit has been selected for the GBR location (indicated as \"Phase 1 of Pit and Saturated Rock Fill\" on Figure 6.18-2). The Phase 1 area is a graded area of the spoil pile, located at 1565 m elevation with little change in topography. The anticipated groundwater depth of the Phase 1 graded spoil pile will be between 1450 m and 1500 m. Considering the elevation of the graded spoil pile, the groundwater depth is anticipated to be well below the 7 m depth required to account for the freeboar d/barrier ( e.g., to account for the frost line) and GBR reactor depth (5 m). Influent water to the GBR will be taken from the Raw Water Pond (RWP) which is located in the southern portion of the mine site. This pond receives impacted water from the Central Rock Disposal Area and South Rock Disposal Area (EIA, Appendix 10B, CIAR#42). There is an approximate elevation difference of 67 m from the top of the RWP to the top of the Phase 1 graded spoil pile. An influent conveyance pipeline will run from the RWP to the GBR. The estimated influent pipeline length would be approximately 605 m, including the distance from the RWP to a booster pump prior to inlet heater. Although located within the same footprint of the SBZ, the GBR would be isolated from the SBZ through liner. For further details on the isolation of the GBR from the SBZ please refer to response JRP IR -6.18 m. The GBR reactor, operations building, and buffer pond would be located within close proximity to each other as proposed on Figure 6.18-2. c) Sizing criteria, design basis, and area (footprint) for a conceptual design, including pre-treatment and/or post- treatment units, if any, to meet target effluent concentrations for selenium; Response: The key design parameters for GBRs are flow rate, inf luent concentration, target effluent concentration, removal rat e, and temperature (which affects removal rate). Sizing and footprint of the GBR can be estimated based on these parameters. For the GBR conceptual design, the design basis parameters are sho wn in Table 6.18- 1.

Assumptions for nitrate and selenium removal rates were based on the ongoing column test currently being conducted to evaluate treatment of selenium and nitra te in simulated mine water, under varying operational conditions (response to JRP IR-6.18 a ). A range in zero order nitrate removal rate of 20 to 188 mg/L/day and selenium removal rate of 6 to 278 \u00b5g/L/day, at temperatures ranging from 4 to 8 \u00baC and at influent concentrations of up to 200 mg/L and 1,000 \u00b5g/L for nitrate and selenium, respectively, were considered in GBR sizing based on previous bioreactor experience (as described in Addendum 10, JRP IR-5.5, CIAR#251; and response to JRP IR -6.18 a) and current column testing. influent concentrations of up to 200 mg/L and 1,000 \u00b5g/L for nitrate and selenium, respectively. Conceptual design for pre-treatment units include influent heaters and amendment dosing systems to ensure that inlet temperature and ade quate carbon and nutrients are provided for biomass maintenance and growth. An inlet heater is assumed as needed to maintain an inlet temperature at approximately 6 \u00baC in the winter months only. Conceptual design for post-treatment units include a buffer pond, aerators, and transfer pump with weir structure to control buffer pond water elevation. Based on the assumed Project design param eters, the area (footprint) for the conceptual design of the Project GBR, GBR operations building (containing pre- treatm ent components), and buffer pond (containing post-treatment components) would be 89.25 m x 333 m, 40 m x 40 m, and 28.5 m x 66 m, respec tively (Figure 6.18-3). d)Description of design elements that maintain flows during winter months; Response: The following design elements are used to maintain flows during winter months: Influent water to the GBR will be sourced from the RWP at a flow rate of 3000 m 3/d. The size of the pond is anticipated to mitigate freezing below a certain depth. Conceptual desi gn currently assumes a pontoon pump with de- icers on the RWPBENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 206 surface, but a submersible pump station pulling water from a depth that is anti cipated to maintain a more consistent water temperature will be considered in engineering design. An inlet water heater will ensure a minimum of 6\u00b0C is maintained in the influent of the GBR. GBR operations building will be heated so that chemicals in the building will not freeze and temperature meets all equipment suggested temperature operational ranges. If required, an electron donor dosing shed will have an HVAC/heater included to maintain suitable operational temperature within a with a suitable clas sification for the hazardous area rating. All pipelines for the GBR will be buried under mounded soil and installed so thatpipelines will be under constant draining conditions. Lines that cannot be buried under mounded soil will be protected with heat tracing andinsulation. The GBR will be constructed under the frost line (assumed 2 m) with a buffer layer of media. Membranes are used to ensure that infiltration does not occur within the GBR so that GBR capacity and temperature can be maintained. The buffer pond is designed to be under constant flow and aeration is anticipated tomitigate the formation of ice. Redundancy of any of the aspects / components to ensure consistent operations, shoul d components fail, will be assessed in a hazard and operabili ty study (HAZOP) meeting during engineering design. e)Time required to design, procure, construct and commission the gravel bed reactors, startup time for normal and for emergency operation; Response: Final design of the GBR will take 8 to 10 months once final location and design parameters are selected. A field scale GBR pilot test is planned to be conducted prior to full scale application which will assist with reducing design time for the fu ll scale GBR. Procurement and construction of a GBR system c an be completed in one year. Initial start-up will take approximately 3 months and subsequent re-starts will take 1.5 to 2 months. f)Volumes of water to be treated (design treatment capacity); Response: The GBR conceptual design has an active reactor volume of 111,333 m 3, a pore volume of 50,100 m3, and is designed for 3,000 m3/day to treat design basis concentrations of 40 mg/L of nitrate and 600 \u00b5g/L of selenium. The pumping system and systems supporting GBR turn-up and turn- down capabilities regardin g flowrate will be evaluated further in the engineering design. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 207 g)Utility requirements; Response: The utility requirements are currently assumed to be based on electrical heating although propane heating is an alternative that may be explored during detailed design. Initial estimates of electrical demand assuming constant design flow are outlined below: Winter Demand 1750 kW Summer Demand 221 kW h)Details and iii.storage volumes. Response: The GBR may use the following chemicals (other options for each will be considered during detailed design): Methanol - Electron donor Approximately 5,500 US Gallon Double Wall 304SS Tank (build according toAPI 12F modified code of construction due to small si ze). Secondary containment area outdoors with 110% capacity of tank. Phosphoric Acid - Nutrient addition to GBR biomass Approximately 1 Tote (275 US Gallons) storage. Secondary Containment (385 Gallons). Yeast Extract [Lallemand FNI 150]) sodium bromide o r chloride - Tracer Make- down Tank with Mixer (475 US Gallons) Standard Pallet (to keep bags of tracer) Hydrochloric Acid (35%) for calcite mitigation. 5,850 US Gallon corrosion resistant double wall fiberglass storage tank (assumedcapacity of 5,500 US Gallon used) Placed in secondary containment area in pre-treatment building with 110%capacity of tank (approximately 6,500 US Gallons).BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 208 glycolic acid or oxidant - Biofouling mitigation Storage space and spare chemical dosing pumps will be provided for miscellaneous chemicals to be used for biofouling mitigation as required.Estimates of consumption not developed. During prior GBR applications (Mancini et al., 2019; Geosyntec, 2010; response to JRP IR-6.18 a) reagent chemical concentrations within the GBR effluent met discharge requirements defined by regulations. This would be monitored as part of Project's Aquatic Monitoring Plan. i)Proposed monitoring of efficacy, functionality and efficiency of selenium treatment; Response: A detailed monitoring p rogram including routine sampling and analysis of GBR influent and effluent flow and chemistry, and sampling of the GBR monitoring wells will be implemented to assess the GBR selenium treatment performance. Selected parameters (flow rate, dissolved oxygen, oxygen reduction potential, pH) will be analyzed either continuously using in- line meters or using portable field meters. Other parameters, including tot al and dissolved selenium, nitrate, nitrite, alkalinity, dissolved and total organic carbon, microbial biological tools/biomass, anions and cations including metals will also be analyzed with varying degrees of frequency, as required to ascertain treatment performance. Like many other metals and metalloids, selenium can exist in various including organo- selenium complexes, will a lso be analyzed. A comprehensive sampling and analysis program will inform the potential need to ad just system parameters ( e.g., amendment dosing, flow rate) to optimize treatment performance. At this stage of conceptual design, the GBR is designed to monitor for the efficacy, functionality, and efficiency of nitrate and selenium treatment through monitoring wells locations within the reactor (including monitoring wells locations, sampling ports, and removable media blocks to test for biomass parameters [referred to as media coupons]). Monitoring well locations will be placed along the length and width of the GBR. Additional sampling lines from the source water, the GBR inlet (after chemical dosing), the GBR effluent, and the buffer pond effluent will also be incorporated in the sampling and analysis plan. The sampling plan will include a combination of both field and external analytical tests on defined schedules to assess performance. Data collected from field monitoring will include oxygen reduction potential (ORP), temperature, flowrate, pressure, water level, pH, and BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 209 dissolved oxygen (DO) concentr ation. External analytical tests may include but are not limited to the following: ORP, nitrate, nitrite, dissolved and total selenium, selenium species, metals, chemical oxygen demand, dissolved organic carbon, volatile organic carbon,semi -volatile organic carbon, methanol, total suspended solids, volatile fatty acids, and biological analyses ( e.g., molecular biological tools, next generation sequencing, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction). Selenium removal will be analyzed and interpreted through the following means: Rate of concentration decrease in monitoring locations, determined throughcomparison of samples taken at different locations of GB R with increasing residence times. These trends will be compared for nitrate, selen ium, and available nutrients/amendments to direct operation. Tracer tests to evaluate GBR hydraulic properties and aid in adjustment of systemto maintain residence times a t monitoring points along the flow path. With an aid of a flow model, tracer studies will allow operators to determine if GBR ishydraulically distributing influent, nutrient, and electron donor effectively throughthe reactor. The hydraulic results of the tracer studies along with sample resultswill allow for the development of a 1D model of concentration vs. location ofGBR (corresponding to an anticipated hydraulic retention time). Electron donor consumption will be strictly controlled and monitored a t the monitoring locations. Through stoichiometric models, anticipated electron donorrequired dosages will be anticipated. Through the monitored locations operatorscan ensure that sufficient electron donor is being distributed within the reactor toconsume nitrates and precipitate selenium. The electron donor consumption willbe related to the observed changes in biogeochemistry of GBR water (see below)to gauge the microbial community composition and health. Changes in bio- geochemical composition of w ater along the flow path in the GBR will also be evaluated. This will include generation of reducing conditions,consumptions of electron acceptors, which are more readily consumed thanselenate ( i.e., dissolved oxygen, ferric iron and nitrate), and those with a lower reduction potential than selenate ( i.e., sulphate and carbon dioxide). Periodic evaluation of microbial communities at different locations in the GBR.These evaluations will enable operators to determine potential adverse changes tothe population, occurrence of possible inhibitory effects and/or the need tomanage biofouling.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 210 j)Expected variations in selenium removal efficacy including: i.changes due to seasonal changes in temperature, ideally supported by field - validated seasonal removal rates; ii. impacts of variable water flow rates; iii. impacts of variable influent selenium concentrations; and iv. discussion of any operational restriction points for the gravel bed reactors, i.e. does the process have significantly reduced efficacy or is the process ineffective below (or above) a certain operating temperature or selenium concentration. Response: The GBR is designed to treat 3,000 m3/day at the design basis concentrations of 40 mg/L of nitrate and 600 \u00b5g/L of selenium. The current Benga column testing (see response to JRP IR-6.18 a) , which is being performed at a water temperature of 8\u00baC, also included a phase with water temperatures decreased to 4\u00baC to evaluate low temperature effect on microbial activity. The observed removal rates fo r both nitrate and selenium did not change after the temperature decrease from 8\u00baC to 4\u00baC. Based on this, the target removal rates can be achieved as long as a minimum temperature of 4\u00b0C is maintained and enough amendments are provided. It is expected that storage of water within the RWP will alleviate variable flow and act as an equalization pond during high precipitation events or freshet. As such, the removal efficacy of the GBR is not expected to vary due to changing influent flow rate and has been designed to treat 3,000 m 3/day. The pumping system and systems supporting GBR turn-up and turn-down capabilities regarding flowrate will be evaluated further in the engineering design. The potential for the GBR to treat variable selenium concentrations is currently being investigated in an on-going column test. The tested influent concentrations have ranged from 40 to 200 mg/L for nitrate and from 150 to 1,000 \u00b5g/L for selenium. The test results have shown that removal of both constituents occurred concurrently, with kinetics of nitrate removal substantially faster than that for selenium. In general, the bulk removal rates observed in the tested ranges, were proportional with the influent concentrations, consistent with zero -order kinetics assumed for th e modeling of GBR field design. The operational restriction p oints of the GBR would be similar to any biological reactor and include primarily a minimum operating temperature of 4\u00b0C, below which enzymatic microbial functions of biomass are inhibited. A long- term column test is currently on -going to evaluate treatme nt of Se and NO 3 in mine water for the project under varying operational conditions, described in detail in response to JRP IR -6.18 a . The column testing included a phase with water temperatures of 4\u00baC to evaluate low temperature effect on microbial activ ity. The observed BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 211 removal rates for both nitrate and selenium did not change after the temperature decrease from 8\u00baC to 4\u00baC. Interim results from the current column testing for the Project (se e response to JRP IR -6.18 a), have shown selenium treatment up to the tested maximum concentration of 1,000 \u00b5g/L. Treatment of higher concentrations of Se in GBRs has not been tested previously to our knowledge. A maximum treatable selenium concentration may exist, but additional field performance tests or column te sting would need to occur to confirm that value. Previous GBR trials have shown treatment of 20 to 40 \u00b5g/L of selenium, suggesting that this is the minimum treatable concentrations without additional testing for confirmation. k)Expected seasonal variabil ity in post- treatment effectiveness, such as water re - oxygenation before discharge; Response: Seasonal variability is not anticipated to have a major effect on post- treatment effectiveness. The GBR buffer pond incorporates aeration systems and will take into account potential lower oxygen uptake capability during warmer temperatures, if any. The buffer pond will be designed to minimize inflow/infiltration, there should not be a major differenc e in post- treatment effectiveness or performance that would be season dependent. l)Details on short- term and long- term maintenance requirements of the system including discussion of any actions required to maintain the gravel bed (i.e. management of the biofilm and management of any precipitates); and Response: As provided in response to JRP IR- 5.5 (Addendum 10, CIAR#251), if biofouling or inorganic fouling occurs, it is expected to be predominantly near the influent end of the bioreactor. Engineering design and operational controls will be put into place to monitor and implement biofilm and precipitate accumulation, such that mitigation strategies can be implemented if and when needed. While engineering design can minimize these impacts, most long- term biotreatment projects will require some type of biofouling management program. These programs generally employ a combination of operational, physical and chemical measures for preventing or minimizing biofouling impacts, coupled with periodic rehabilitation of biofouled components and injection zones. In development of biofouling controls for the GBR, Benga will consult previous experience such as that gathered during the development of the report \"A Review of Biofouling Controls for Enhanced In Situ Bioremediation of Groundwater,\" developed for the ES TCP (Environmental Security Technology Certification Program from the US Department of Defense) in October 2005 and the previous experience in biofouling mitigation approaches on previous GBR and in -situ biotreatment projects (Geosyntec, 2005b). BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 212 Short-term potential biofouling and inorganic fouling mitigation measures that may be considered in the GBR include the following: Dosing of antiscalant to reduce the potential for calcite precipitation and to interfe re with the continued propagation of c alcite precipitate when it does occur. Including the ability to perform chemical cleans (acid, caustic, oxidants, etc.) on individual nodes of the influent manifold, allowing for periodic localized in-situ cleans near the influent infrastructure. Cleaning chemical and sequence will be selected based on the nature of the fouling, whether biological or inorganic. Long- term potential mitigation measures will include, at minimum, frequent monitoring of influent concentrations of nitrate and selenium such that carbon and nutrient dosing can be adjusted to maintain optimal levels of biomass. m)Details on post- mining operational requirements and time required to decommission and reclaim the gravel bed reactor and related grav el bed reactor infrastructure. Respons e: The GBR is anticipated to operate post -mining with similar requirements to the mining operational requirements, however the chemical dosing demand is anticipated to decrease as the reduced nitrate load, which requires the bulk of electron donor, is offs et by increasing selenium load (as outlined in Appendix 10B, Water and Load Balance Model Report (EIA, Appendix 10B, CIAR#42). A GBR decommissioning plan and reclamation plan will be outlined in the engineering design phase. In concept, a benefit of the GBR is that upon completion of duty, the influent and effluent piping can be capped, and given the presence of its liner and cover, the GBR can be decommissioned/abandoned in place. Calculations have shown that leakage rates through a liner are likely to be extremely small, and GBRs are therefore effectively hydraulically isolated from their surrounding environment. Considering a range of defects (1 to 4 defects per acre) and a liner surface area of 8.9 acres, the range in leakage considered would be betw een 1.6*10 -3 m3/year to 6.5*10-3 m3/year (values of assumed leakage based on composite liner construction). As such, the GBR could be left in place saturated, which would maintain the anoxic conditions that maintain t he selenium in immobile form, or they could be drained if there are concerns about water inadvertently leaking out of the GBR. All above ground infrastructure and equipment will be removed from the site at the end of the GBR lifetime, and infrastructure pads will be punctured at regular intervals to prevent ponding of water at the surface. GBR venting infrastructure will be removed last to ensure that all biological activity within the GBR has been exhausted prior to sealing or excavating the system. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 213 Progressive reclamation can be considered for GBR, similar to the approach taken for the SBZ, where the area after decommissioning will be covered with clean soil and reclaim vegetation. Considerations need to be taken into the engineering stage for decom missioning of GBR ventilation lines, top liner, and cover media for the GBR. The GBR reactor volume will still be capped and buried to reduce risk of infiltration if GBR media is kept in place.

Tenth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. Response to Information Request 5.5. (CIAR #251). As noted in Section C.8.3.1 (CEAR #42), Benga indicated that the Project will use comparable mining and processing methods as those employed by Teck Resources in th e Elk Valley, British Columbia. In the response to IR 5.5, Benga provided supplemental information to demonstrate the effectiveness of the saturated backfill zone. Benga stated that the saturated backfill zone approach has been implemented and is providing excellent results at the Teck Elk Valley facility where a saturated backfill zone has been in operation since 2017. T imberwolf Wilderness Society (CIAR #281) indicated that no supporting evidence for this statement was cited and requested that technical reports, publications and data be provided to support the claim that the Teck Elk Valley facility \"is providing excellent results... since 2017\" in removing selenium from contaminated runoff and seepage water at the scale required by this project. In Consultant Report #5 (CIAR #42), Benga stated that the saturated backfill zones are assumed to attenuate 99% of selenium loading. Environment and Climate Change Canada stated (CIAR #167) that according to Figure #6 of Appendix the rate of attenuati on of selenium in optimal conditions tested under the barrel trial was BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 216 around 90%, and resulting concentration of selenium in the effluent would be 150 g/L. Tsuut'ina Nation also highlighted (CIAR #192) that the consequences of the saturated backfill zone being slightly less effective than assumed would be enormous. In the response to IR 5.5, Benga summarized several case studies that noted different attenuation rates: 90 -95% (Kirk et al. 2017), 97% (Jones et al. 2009; Ness et al. 2014), 98% (Pahler et al. 2007), and 99% (Bianchin et al. 2013). The response to IR 5.5 noted that for one saturated backfill zone example \"the total selenium concentration in the in- pit saturated water is less than 1% that observed upgradient, suggesting that up to 99% of the selenium is being attenuated.\" However, there was no information presented with respect to whether the 99% attenuation rate was also the case at the Teck Elk Valley facility. Although Benga provided the Elk Valley Water Quality Plan, none of the above- mentioned reports, publications, or data regarding the Teck Elk Valle y facility were provided to support Benga's statements regarding the effectiveness of saturated backfill zone technology. If this information is to be considered by the Panel, it must be placed on the public record. Further details on the performance of the Teck Elk Valley facility are required to demonstrate and support Benga's assumptions of 99% removal efficiency of selenium. a)Indicate whether the technical reports, publications (peer -reviewed or non- peer reviewed) and data regarding the Teck Elk Valley saturated backfill zone facility are publicly available, and if so, provide the information as supporting evidence to the Panel. Response: The references cited in the preamble above were provided in Addendum 10, JRP IR-5.5, Appendix 5.5-1 ( CIAR#251). The locations of these publications within Addendum 10 is discussed below. Table 6.19- 1 provides the pdf pg numbers within Addendum 10, Appendix 5.5-1 ( CIAR#251), that correspond with each publication listed in the preamble to this information request.

In- situ Immobilization of Selenium within the Saturated Zones of Backfilled Pits and Coal- Mine Operations. Appendix 5.5-1 Pdf pg 350 -365 In regard to publicly available data regarding the Teck Elk Valley saturated backfill zone facility, Benga provided what was available at the time of submis sion of Addendum 10 ( CIAR#251). A t the request of the JRP, Benga included the Teck Elk Valley Water Quality Plan in Appendix 5.5- 2 (Addendum 10, CIAR#251). Since t hen, Teck has produced a report titled, Elk Valley Water Quality Plan: 2019 Implementation Plan Adjustment, July 31, 2019 (Revision 1.0), Annex J: Alternative Treatment Mitigation Plan, which describes the Saturated Rock Fill (SRF) technology and other alternative selenium treatment options (e.g., gravel bed reactors, similar to those presented by Benga [JRP IR-6.18]). This document has also been provided in Appendix 6.19-1. There has also been an updated Elk Valley Water Quality Plan: Five Year Update (Se ptember 2019) which states: \"One of the most exciting advancements has come from our Research and Development program, which has developed a new form of water treatment using Saturated Rock Fills (SRF). Our first SRF has been commissioned at Elkview Opera tions and is achieving near complete removal of selenium and nitrate . SRF water treatment technology can help to achieve water quality objectives more quickly and efficiently than other forms of treatment. T he SRF at Elkview is treating up to 10 million litres of water each day and we have plans to expand the Elkview SRF to treat 20 million litres per day.\" The Elk Valley Water Quality Plan: Five Year Update (September 2019) has been provided in Appendix 6.19-2. Also provided in Appendix 6.19-3 is the Teck Permit 107517 Environmental Monitoring Committee 2019 Public Report, which summarizes their learnings around selenium management in 2018. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 218 b) For the Teck Elk Valley information, discuss the selenium removal efficiency for the saturated backfill zones and provide evidence from the Teck Elk Valley facility to support the use of an attenuation rate of 99% for selenium in the saturated backfill zone proposed for this project. Response: Unfortunately, publicly available data on the performance of Teck Elk Val ley's saturated backfill zones (SBZ) (or saturated rock fills) is not available at the time of submission of this Addendum 11 information request package. The schedule to release this type of data from Teck is currently unknown. Teck (2019 Implementation Plan) indicate that they are continuing to conduct research and development t o confirm that their SRFs are performing to set targets and will ultimately be proposed to provincial and federal governments in 2020 as an alternative means of selenium manageme nt, as opposed to mechanical treatment facilities. Short of having Teck- speci fic data, to further reduce uncertainty in this technology, Benga has been working with several of the same technical experts who have also contributed to the Teck Elk Valley selenium treatment options for the Grassy Mountain Coal Project's selenium manag ement plan design and engineering, ( e.g., saturated rock fill, and gravel bed reactor technology). In regard to attenuation rate of 99%, for the response to JRP IR -6.25, Benga ha s presented a sensitivity analysis which shows model results for total selenium concentrations in Blairmore Creek assuming 95% and 90% removal of selenium in the saturated zones. Although selenium levels are high in these scenarios, it is important to note that selenium levels are not forecasted to exceed the proposed selenium guideline, until 10 years after the start of operations. This is a result of the rate of selenium leaching being proportional to the amount of rock stored in the rock dump, which increases through the years with mine activity. As illustrated in Table 5.5 -1 (Addendum 10, JRP IR -5.5, CIAR#251), Benga has committed to implementing research and development regarding saturated backfill technology, and during the first 10 years after m ine start-up, Benga will also be monitoring the selenium removal rates in the SBZ as well as selenium concentrations in the surge ponds and raw water pond. The lead up time to operations and early years of mine development equates to approximately 14 to 15 years, during which continuing research and continuous improvement in selenium management technologies will be advanced by Benga. It is assumed during this time that additional information from Teck Elk Valley will also become publicly available.

Per mit 107517 Environmental Monitoring Committee 2019 Public Report Information Request 6.20 Tenth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. Response to Information Request 5.1, 5.5, Appendix 5.5-2. (CIAR #251). Comments from the Government of Canada En vironment and Climate Change Canada submission. (CIAR #283). Benga's response to comments on sufficiency. (CIAR the response to IR 5.1 (CIAR #251), Benga indicated it is proposing to construct a cascade from the discharge point of the saturated backfill zone to allow re-oxygenation of the saturated backfill zone discharge and for the oxidation of selenite to selenate, subsequently reducing the uptake of selenium into aquatic algae. Environment and Climate Change Canada (CIAR #283) indic ated that a trial test of this proposed solution should be performed to demonstrate the efficiency of this additional treatment to change the speciation of selenium, or that appropriate literature, based on case studies elsewhere, should be provided. In response to this comment, Benga stated (CIAR #291) that it was confident in the selenium removal mitigation using a saturated backfill zone, and committed to ensuring this mitigation is implemented to achieve the intended results. To assure the Panel of this commitment, Benga provided a draft plan outlining how Benga has and will continue to implement testing and other research and development initiatives to progressively develop the detailed engineering parameters for the saturated backfill zone. Chapter 6 of the Elk Valley Water Quality Plan (Appendix 5.5-2) indicates that cascades could be used to relieve calcite supersaturation, but does not discuss the use of cascades to influence speciation of selenium. In the response to IR 5.1 (CIAR #251), Benga re-iterated that following the oxidation step of the cascade, effluent would be monitored to assess speciation. Benga stated that if the effluent exhibited a high proportion of selenite, appropriate actions would be taken, such as re-cycling off- spec effluent to the raw water pond or back through the saturated backfill zone, or adjusting the treatment process. Benga did not provide supporting details regarding the efficiency of the cascade system to convert selenium from selenite to selenate. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 220 a)Provide further d etails to support the efficacy of the cascade to convert selenite to selenate using appropriate literature and case studies; Response: For clarification purposes, the cascade or mechanical aeration was not intended to convert selenite to selenate, but to increase ORP and dissolved oxygen in the effluent before discharge to Blairmore Creek. Aeration testing would also be performed to chec k the conversion of selenite to selenate; however, Benga recognizes that aeration through cascade or mechanical means alo ne will not be effective in this conversion process. Benga will implement advanced oxidation processes with powerful oxidant like hydrogen peroxide injection or ozone addition, if necessary, to further the conversion of carry- over selenite to selenate. T he current proposal is that mechanical aeration will be used within the 24 -hour buffer pond to address increase in dissolved oxygen. b)Indicate if reagents such as hydrogen peroxide will be required to oxidize selenite to selenate within the short retent ion time provided by the cascades, and if so, explain any potential consequences on water quality parameters from the addition of thes e reagents; Response: Advanced oxidation processes, such as hydrogen peroxide and/or ozone may be needed to oxidize seleni te to selenate (currently other mining companies are implementing this at site for Selenite and Nitrite oxidation) if carry over from the SBZ is found to be occurring. As noted above, the intended approach for re- aeration will be through cascade or mechan ical aeration that will occur in the 24 -hour buffer pond. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) will be typically be supplied as 50% concentrated active solution and stored at site. Injection will be done inline followed by static mixer to ensure proper agitation and reaction. If Ozone gas (O 3) is used, Ozone will be generated in-situ at site by a prepackaged containerized Ozone generation unit consisting of air compressor, oxygen concentrators, ozone generator and cooling system. Such units are typically compacted in size and include all generation equipment pre-installed and wired inside a single or stacked 40' or 53' seacan. Ozone gas is injected inline through eductors or pressurized diffused vessel. If additional reagents, such as hydrogen peroxide or ozone, a re required to convert selenite to selenate, their residuals remaining after treatment may need to be quenched with reducing reagents such as sodium bisulfite before effluent discharge. Quenching requirements will be confirmed during the testing / monitoring program by Benga. Aeration process retention time will not be limited to mechanical aeration but will also extend to the 24-hour buffer pond, before treated water is discharged to Blairmore Creek. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 221 c)If hydrogen peroxide or any other reagents will be required, present reaction stoichiometry and demonstrated removal mechanisms. Response: For Ozone: SeO 3\u00b2 + O 3------ > SeO 4-2 + O 2, accordingly 1 mole of O 3 to 1 mole of SeO 3\u00b2 (0.4 mg of O 3 required to oxidize 1 mg of SeO 3\u00b2). Reference: Chemistry of Ozone in Water and Wastewater Treatment By Clemens von Sonntag, Urs von Gunten. For Hydrogen Peroxide: SeO 3\u00b2 + H 2O2 ------ > SeO 4-2 + H 2O, accordingly 1 mole of H 2O2 to 1 mole of SeO 3\u00b2 (0.3 mg of H2O2 required to oxidize 1 mg of SeO 3\u00b2). Reference: Kinetics of H 2O2 Oxidation of Selenious acid By Francis J. Hughes and Don S. Martin. Benga may utilize advanced oxidation process ( i.e., hydrogen peroxide and ozone together) to further promote the oxidation of selenite to selenate if carryover from the SBZ is no ted as a concern during the monitoring of water quality at the site. Information Request 6.21 Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency Operational Policy Statement: \"Addressing \"Purpose of\" and \"Alternative Means\" under the Canadian Environmental Assessmen t Act, 2012 \". (March 2015). Grassy Mountain Coal Project Updated Environmental Impact Assessment. Section A.7. (CIAR #42). Eighth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. Appendix C-2. (CIAR #89). Comments from the Government of Canada Environm ent and Climate Chang e Canada submission. (CIAR #167). Comments from Tsuut'ina Nation. (CIAR #192). Environment Canada (CIAR #167) and Tsuut'ina Nation (CIAR #192) have questioned the treatment performance of the saturated backfill zone proposed by Benga, and have noted that a decrease in the selenium attenuation rate from 99% to 95% would drastically increase selenium concentrations in Blairmore Creek. Although Benga presented the results of a barrel trial in Appendix C-2 of Addendum 8 (CIAR #89), Benga has not presented field data showing that a removal rate of 99% will be attainable with the saturated backfill zone at Grassy Mountain, nor that it can produce a final BENGA MI NING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 222 effluent selenium concentration of 1 to 5 \u00b5g/L. Several other treatmen t technologies, such as an active treatment plant, can attain such removal rates or low selenium effluent concentrations, but have varying economic costs. In Section A.7 (CIAR #42), Benga identified that the saturated backfill zone option has been selected as the total capital costs are considerably less than the water treatment plant, and the ongoing operating costs are also considerably less as well. In Section A.7 (CIAR #42), Benga presented an alternative means analysis that compared the technical and e conomic feasibility of the saturated backfill zone with an active treatment plant. However, this evaluation was insufficiently detailed: the technology for the active treatment plant was not specified (chemical precipitation, membrane filtration, or biological reduction), nor was its suitability to treat up to 30,000 m3/day or to produce an effluent with 1 to 2 \u00b5g/L selenium evaluated. Given the critical importance of the proposed saturated backfill zone in mitigating potential effects of selenium, and the limited examples of the use of these systems at a large scale, the Panel requests an updated and more detailed alternative means analysis that compares the technical and economic feasibility of alternative treatment options for selenium. Benga should follow the methodology presented in the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA) guidance entitled \"Addressing \"Purpose of\" and \"Alternative Means\" under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012\"5to carry out its analysis. a)Provide an alternative means analysis that investigates the technical and economic feasibility of the saturated backfill zone vs. an activate treatment plant for selenium removal. In addition to the completion of the steps as outlined in the CEAA guidance, this analysis shoul d specifically: i.Present and rationalize evaluation criteria and their overall weighting. Identify a criterion that reflects the requirement for very long- term treatment; ii.Provide a design basis for the e valuation of treatment options (such as feed flow rates and chemistry, target effluent concentrations); iii.Include the ability of the system to have a maximum treatment capacity of 30,000 m3/day as one of the criteria; and iv.Compare capital and operating costs on an equivalent basis (i.e., $/1,000 m3). 5 Available online: Operational rpose of\" and Means\" Act, 2012\". https://www.ceaa.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=1B095C22 - 1&pedisable=true BENGA MI NING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 223 b)Rate each option and present the rationale for allocating scores. Where a quantitative comparis on is not possible, provide a qua litative justification for each of the scores. Response: Technically an d Economically F easible Alternative s for Selenium Treatment In the EIA submitted i n August 2016, S ection A.7.6 ( CIAR#42) Benga identifie d feasibl e alternativ es for selenium treatment, being a Saturated Backfil l Zone (SBZ ) and an Active Treatmen t Plant. Since that time, Benga has also evaluated Gravel Bed Reactors (GBR) as a pos sible technology for selenium treatment. It is importan t to note that these technologi cal solutions are not mutually exclusiv e but rather can all exist to some degree within the Project. Benga' s preferred alternative, for reasons to be described below, is the SBZ. However, Benga has clearly stated in response to previous Informati on Reque sts that a s mall scale GBR may be constructed early in the Projec t as a field scale pilot to gain insight into the design considerations for full scale biologica l treatmen t of s elenium. In addition, Benga has committed that either a GBR or an Active Treat ment Plant may be built as a back up contingency if the SBZ performance is not adequate. SBZ D escription The SB Z process a nd conc ept ar e described in the EIA (A ppendix 10B, C IAR#42). T he attenuati on principle that anoxic conditions promote the conversion o f solubl e selenat e ions (SeO 42-) to selenite lementa l seleniu m metal (Se0). Selenit e is less soluble and tends to adsorb to mine ral surfaces. E leme ntal seleniu m is insoluble. T herefore, the conversion of selenate causes the reduced seleniu m species to become attenuated within the saturated backfill. The key to the attenuation process is the formation of sub-oxic conditions. Sub-oxic conditions are generated by microorganisms as they metabolize carbon and nutrients. Therefore , the presenc e of carbon a nd nutrients in the mine water is required for the process to work. T he waste rock in the saturat ed backf ill serve as a s ubstrate for the microorganisms. Figure 6.21- 1 below shows the conceptual layout of an SBZ. A manage d SBZ simply consists of a system for adding an organic carbon source and nutrients to the mine wate r as it flows to the SBZ and a series of monitoring wells. T his is identica l to the process u sed in activ e water treatment plants for selenium removal such as the A BMet process developed by GE Water (Appendix 6.21-1) only on a much larger scale. Sources o f organic carbon that have been used in similar application s include m olasses a nd methanol. The dose of organic carbon required depends primarily in the concentration of dissolved oxygen and nitrate in the mine wa ter. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 224 GBR Description The concept of the GBR, complete with drawings, is fully described in response to JRP IR-6.18. A GBR uses the same removal concept as a SBZ but GBRs are generally constructed within a natural depression or constructed cell and the top and bottom of the treatment zone are lined using synthetic membrane s to prevent water escape/influx and ensure hydraulic isolation from the surrounding environment. The bed is filled with gravel (or crushed waste rock) of a consistent size (typically 0.75 to 2 inch), with fines removed to promote predictable flow within the GBR. A top liner and insulating layer ( e.g., additional rock or soil) can then be installed as needed to maintain the temperature and prevent leakage, diffusion of air and infiltra tion of water into the GBR. A buffer pond is in some cases used to aer ate and retain effluent water before it is returned to the receiving environment. Operation of a GBR requires pumping of the source water, mixed with an electron donor such as methanol, through the GBR. As with the SBZ, continuous monitoring and adjustme nt of operational parameters is required to maintain an effective treatment process. Fluidized Bed Reactor Description As indicated in response to JRP IR-5.6 (Addendum 10, CIAR#251), Benga would choose a Reactor (FBR) technology if it is requ ired to install an active treatment plant for removal of selenium. This is the same technology that was chosen and installed by Teck at its Line Creek Operations and which has been shown to efficiently reduce selenium concentrations to below 20 ug/L based on a capacity of 7,500 m 3/day. In an FBR system, wastewater is passed through a granular solid media (sand or granular activated carbon) at sufficient velocity to suspend the media an d cause it to behave as though it were a fluid. Under anoxic/anaerobic conditions, heterotrophic facultative bacteria use nitrates, selenate, and selenite as electron acceptors as means of respiration. These bacteria grow on and are attached to the FBR's media. Fluidization of media with pumps keeps the media with attached biomass in suspension and expanded to a depth that promotes contact of the water with the biomass for effective treatment. Generally, the bacteria's preference of electron acceptor is for DO first, followed by the following oxyanions: nitrate, nitrite, s elenate, selenite, chlorate, perchlorate, and sulfates. The bacteria need an organic carbon (electron donor) source to meet their food/energy requirements - typically methanol. Because the FBR is fluidized, the FBR effluent will contain reduced elemental selenium in colloidal form (typically around 0.1 micron in size) attached to the sloughed off excess biomass from the media. Hence, it is critical that these solids be removed to preve nt reoxidation of some elemental selenium back to soluble selenite and selenate forms in the aerobic biological polishing reactor and subsequently in the oxygen rich creek water. In order to remove the solids including particulate Se from the FBR effluent, ballasted sand clarifiers are used for liquid - solids separation. A ballasted sand clarifier could be selected for this application to maintain anoxic condition during liquid-solids separation. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 225 Depending upon the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) discha rge requirements, the FBR will likely require aerobic polishing of the dissolved BOD from the ballasted sand clarifier effluent. The unused electron donor (organic carbon such as methanol) added to the FBRs as food for bacteria will be present as residual dissolved BOD. Given the low BOD concentrations of the clarifier effluent, this polishing can be done a variety of ways but most efficiently in an aerobic environment with another attached growth system such as a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR). Effluent from the MBBR will contain suspended solids, primarily biological solids. Tertiary sand filtration system was selected to remove the suspended solids from the MBBR effluent before the final treated effluent discharge. Continuous upflow granular media filters with continuous backwash were selected for this process to enable cont inuous back wash flow without the addition of backwash pumps and tanks, which will increase the overall system footprint and complexity. The filter employs an airlift system fo r media scouring and solids removal. The slurry is removed from the system and sent to the solids thickener. Finally, a solid handling system will be required to deal with the sludge removed from the water in the various filters and separators. Solids will be disposed with the mine waste rock during operations and subsequently in an approved manner at a land -fill site. Comparative Potential Effects on Valued Components Water Quality and Aquatic Habitat - All three potential technologies (SBZ, GBR and FB R) are technically capable of reducing selenium concentration in effluent to a level in the order of 0.015 mg/L . Performance below this threshold is not certain for any of the three. Given that the expected performance is the basis for assessing the alternatives to be \"feasible\", all three would be equivalent with regard to these V Cs. Air Quality (GHGs) - Benga considers that the SBZ will require the least energy to operate of the three alternative technologies. The SBZ and the GBR will be sufficiently large and deep below the surface to moderate the temperature of the water withou t energy input. The FBR will require heaters to manage water temperatures within a suitable range in winter and will therefore require more energy to operate. Long Term Disturb ance to Wildlife and Traditional Practices - As the treatment of selenium is projected to continue for decades after the completion of mining and reclamation of the surrounding area, the continuing presence of selenium treatment facilities will be the last disturbance affecting the return of wildlife to the area and the enjoyment of the reclaimed landscape for traditional purposes. In these terms, Benga considers the SBZ to be the least intrusive in the long term with perhaps the potential to transition from an actively managed treatment process to a passive process with few pumps or visible operating equipment. The GBR requires active management and continuous operational input simply because the flow rates are higher and the retention time lower than the SBZ; consequently, operational adjustments will be BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 226 required on a daily basis t o maintain effective treatment. The FBR will be the most intrusive of the three alternatives in the long term requiring full time staff to operate the facility and a significan t building to house the equipment. Waste Management - Of the three technologies considered, the SBZ and the GBR are the only alternatives that will not normally produce sludge that will need to be disposed in a waste management facility. The biological ma terials within the SBZ and GBR will be permanently contained in the very large pore space of the reactors. Economic Comparison Benga has developed economic parameters for the 3 alternatives based on design criteria that are suitable for each of the technol ogies using an initial design capacity of 15,000 m 3/d. All of the technologies are scalable up to the required 30,000 m3/day. SBZ Economics - The creation of the SBZ itself does not present significant additional cost to the Project as the pit excavation and subsequent filling of the pit with waste rock will be done normally as part of the mine plan. There are additional dikes required to establish the water retention capabilities for the SBZ and prevent the remainder of the pit from flooding and additional care needs to be taken to arrange the in -fill rock to maximize treatment efficiency. Additional facilities required include injection wells, extraction wells, test wells and instrumentation, pumps and pipelines to transfer water and storage tanks for handling methanol required for the process. Benga has done a high- level estimat e to construct the SBZ1 phase 1 - 3 which will have a volume of approximately 650,000 m 3 and be able to handle 15,000 m3/d with peak throughputs of 18,000 m3/day. The cost esti mate for this SBZ is $60 million as per Table 6.21- 1. Table 6.21-1 Table of CAPEX for SBZ 1 ( Phase 1 - 3) Alternative Category CAPEX Engineering and Design 4.5 Million Equipment (pumps, tanks, etc. ) 4.5 Million Earthworks (dikes, liners, grading, etc. ) 19.0 Million Civil (buildings, foundations, intake structures, etc.) 3.0 Million Piping (water transfer pipelines) 5.5 Million Electrical (power lines, transformers, switchgear) 10.0 Million Instrumentation (sensors, and control systems) 1.5 Million Contingency (25%) 12.0 Million Total 60.0 Million BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 227 In terms of long- term operating costs, Benga considers that one or two full time employee or contractor could manage the day to day operation of a 15,000 m3/d SBZ operation with periodic contracting to m aintain pipes and pumps. Long term annual costs will be would be about $1.5 million per year. There will be very little cost to remediate the treatment system at end of life with only pumps, tanks and other above ground equipment to be taken away. GBR Ec onomics - Benga has prepared a preliminary design for a GBR that could manage a 3,000 m3/day flow rate of water to be treated which would have a footprint of approximately 90 m by 335 m. This is about one fifth of the required 15,000 m3/d required capacit y and therefore the GBR would need to be expanded in size or additional GBR units would need to be built to accommodate the required water treatment capacity. To estimate costs for the GBR construction and operation on an equivalent basis to the SBZ, the following assumptions have been made: costs include construction and operation associated with the GBR reactor unit only. In other words, the cost estimate excludes all costs associated with excavation and preparation of land; rock to be used in construction of GBR reactor bed and cover; and heating of water within the reactor. Based on the conceptual design, which is described in the response to JRP IR -6.18, Benga estimates the capital cost for a single module at a treatment flow rate of 3000 m 3/d to be $20 million; an expanded GBR to accommodate the full water treatment capacity of 15,000 m3/d would be estimated to cost about $80 million. Regardless of the number of GBR reactors utilized at the facility all reactors will be within close proximity to each other given the site footprint. All controls can be accessed from a central location. Long term annual costs are anticipated to be in the order of $2.5 million. Decommissioning of the GBR(s) would be similar to the SBZ, with removal of equipment. FBR Ec onomics - Benga has corresponded with suppliers regarding the relative cost of an FBR system. Initial discussions indicate that an FBR designed to handle 15,000 m 3/day would be possible and would cost in the order of $250 - $300 million to construct. In addition, information from vendors indicates that annual operating costs including labor, chemicals, power, solids disposal and other operational costs will be about $25 million per year. Finally, to decommission the buildings and equipment associated with the FBR would be more costly than either of the other alternatives. Overall Evaluation of Alternatives Based on the discussion above, the three alternatives are ranked as follows in Table 6.21-2 (1 is best performance): BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 228 Table 6.21-2 Comparison of Alternative Selenium Treatment Options Alternative Water Quality Air Quality Long Term Disturbance Solid Waste Capex Opex SBZ 1 1 1 1 1 1 GBR 1 1 1 1 2 2 FBR 1 2 3 2 3 3 Since the SBZ alternative is equal to, or superior to, the other two options in all c ategories considered for this evaluation, it is clearly the preferred alternative. As stated at the outset, Benga is aware that both the GBR and the FBR have a longer track record in terms of proven application at this scale. For that reason, Benga conti nues to consider them as contingency plans or perhaps supplemental treatment options should the SBZ not function as anticipated. There is room to implement all three alternatives within the mine footprint if required. Information Request 6.22 Eighth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. Response to Information Request AER- R2- 14. (CIAR #89). Tenth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. Response to Information Request 5.6. (CIAR #251). In the response to IR AER -R2-14 (CIAR #89) Benga noted that active management of the surge ponds is required beyond year 2100, and that it was not possible to reliably estimate the time horizon for when the rate of weathering and selenium release will diminish to a point where active management no longer i s required. It is unclear how Benga can assure the Panel that treatment performance will be maintained over such a lengthy and indeterm inate period of time. In the response to IR 5.6 (CIAR #251), Benga stated that selenium removed by the saturated backfill zone becomes permanently lodged within the rockfill. Benga noted that conditions within the saturated backfill zone would remain anoxic, and the selenium would remain in stable form. Benga stated that the saturated backfill zone can be kept anoxic in perpetuity by ensuring that the water cover is maintained. Given that the saturated backfill zone is a new technology that it is expected to be operated for an indeterminate length of time, and that conditions for its operation are likely to vary over time, it is unclear how Benga will ensure that the saturated backfill zone will remove and retain selenium \"in perpetuity\". Further information is required to reduce the uncertainty associated with the effectiveness of the saturated backfill zone over time. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 229 a)Provide additional information demonstrating that treatment capacity of the saturated backfill zone will not be exceeded throughout its design life; Response: Benga proposes to use multiple saturated backfill zones (SBZ) for selenium treatment at the site. The SBZs will be constructed with multiple cells (phases) and expanded over time. As part of the advancing mine plan, once the initial cells' reach their design capacity, new cells will be prepared and utilized for treatment. Benga has committed to developing and implementing a testing / development program to monitor the SBZ treatment capacity and predict future trends and treatment performance (Addendum 10, JRP IR -5.5, CIAR#251). If future monitoring and analysis indicate that an operating SBZ cell trea tment efficiency is diminishing, the next SBZ phase will be advanced. If monitoring indicates that all the planned SB Z zones will not be effective in treating the anticipated life of mine water balance, Benga has committed to implementing contingency measures including initiating an interim gravel bed reactor (JRP IR-6.18), looking for alternative sites to construct addi tional SBZ's, and constructing an active treatment facility. This will be part of the adaptive management process (Addendum 10, JRP IR -5.5, CIAR#251) initiated at the site to continuously monitor and assess the effectiveness of treatment zones and when adjustments may need to be made in the overall mine plan or schedule. b) Provide additional information demonstrating that the saturated bac kfill zone, as designed, has sufficient adsorption capacity over its design life if selenium is removed via adsorption into iron oxides or other mineral species; Response: Adsorption is not the primary intended removal mechanism for selenium treatment with in this Project's SBZ design. Adsorption capacity is related only to iron coprecipitation of selenite. Unless the raw water has a significant amount of iron, selenite adsorption is unlikely in the SBZ. To be clear, Benga has not indicated that adsorption would be important in the functioning of the SBZ in the EIA or previous information rounds to date. In biological selenium removal systems, such as the SBZ proposed for the Project, reduced elemental selenium particles stay in the SBZ, attached to the r ock surface, within void spaces and on the bacteria. Given the immense surface area represented by the rock within the various SBZs proposed for the Project, and the relat ively smaller mass of elemental selenium to be removed during the life of the Projec t, Benga does not anticipate a capacity constraint. As noted in part a), the efficacy of treatment within the SBZ environment will be monitored continuously during operations and trend analyses will be conducted on the performance to help inform operational management decisions and timing of subsequent phases SBZ cell construction. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 230 c) Describe whether the saturated backfill zone has the potential to become saturated with se lenium in its elemental form and become less effective over time; Response: See the response to part b). d)Describe the circumstances under which selenium could become remobilized, the potential effects associated of this remobilization, and present measu res that would mitigate these potential effects (e.g., whether the ability to treat water can be restored after an event that remobilized selenium); Response: Benga does not foresee circumstances under which selenium could become remobilized in large quantities once it is deposited as elemental selenium and adhered to the rock surface in the SBZ. Such an occurrence would require a sudden \"oxygenation\" of the SBZ, which is not likely given that the entire SBZ is below the natural ground water level after mining. During the mining operation, some degree of selenium remobilization may occur under certain operating conditions: a small portion of the selenate may not be c ompletely reduced to elemental selenium and may exist in selenite form, which is soluble; too low of an oxygen reduction potential (ORP) in zones of the SBZ may reduce a small portion of selenium to soluble organic reduced selenium species such as selenocyante,methylated selenium, and other organic selenides, which are soluble; or a small amount of non -soluble elemental selenium may be carried out of the SBZ in the flowing wate r. In all cases, it is likely that as the water moves through the SBZ it will encounter a zone with the appropriate anoxic conditions to re -establish the reduction of selenium from these forms back to elemental form, or that the floatin g elemental selenium will re -adhere to a rock surface. If soluble species or floating elemental selenium are discharged as SBZ effluent to the Buffer Pond, Benga's testing and monitoring program would detect that non- optimal conditions are occurring within the SBZ, which would allow Benga time to react. This reaction may be in the form of placing effluent into recycle mode so that effluent will be re -injected to the SBZ to undertake another treatment pass. In addition, measures may be taken to adjust the SBZ operation, which may include adjustments to carbon injection fluxes, altering injection or withdrawal sites, and changing flow rates. Finally, if operational adjustments do not control the issue, contingency plans as discussed in part a) will be implemented. e)Explain whether the effectiveness of the saturated backfill zone may be subject to 'drift' (a gradual change in performance) because of long -term changes in feed flowsBENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 231 or chemistry. Describe what design elements are proposed to detect such long- term trends, and to adjust system operation to maintain treatment performance. Discuss whether it is anticipated that the saturated backfill zone will need to be refurbished to restore optimal performance; Response: Benga expects and have anticipated that the effectiveness o f the SBZ will change over time. Rigorous monitoring and trend analysis will be utilized to assess and predict drift within the system. This assessment will be used in conjunction with mine planning t o schedule the construction of the next SBZ or to impl ement operational adjustments. Operational adjustments may include modifications to injection of carbon donor rates, adding additional injection or extraction points within the SBZ geometry or changing flow rates through the SBZ. If SBZ effluent does not meet water quality limits, it would require reprocessing either in a new SBZ cell or in a gravel bed reactor or an active treatment system as per Benga's stated contingency plans. There is no intent t o re-furbish the SBZ once it is constructed as this wo uld be uneconomical and would not meet the overall mine waste rock material balances. f)Discuss whether Benga anticipates the need to manage a residue, such as sludge or accumulating biomass. Describe how Benga will manage such residues, if necessary; and Response: Most solids are expected to stay in the SBZ, however some minor solids ( e.g., biomass) may slough off from the rocks and void spaces and carry over in the effluent and settle in the 24-hour buffer pond. In case of excessive solids accumulation in the 24-hour Buffer Pond, dredging and disposal of the solids would be required. Benga anticipates that disposal of such solids would be in pit with waste rock. g) Provide additional information to support Benga's capacity and commitment to manage selen ium levels at the Project site until active management is no longer required. Response: As with all aspects related to final reclamation of the Project site, Benga understands that natural processes will take some time after mine closure to re- establish st able and healthy ecosystems. In the case of selenium treatment, the very conservative assumptions taken in the modelling to date, combined with the novel approach represented by the SBZ technology itself, present some uncertainty relative to the duration and effort required to reach this desired outcome. However, during the course of the Pr oject, these uncertainties will be reduced through experience and data and more precise estimates of time and effort will be available. For example, Benga anticipates that progressive reclamation of the South Rock Disposal area will begin before year 10 of mining BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 232 operations. Monitoring of the quantity and selenium concentration of water collected in the Southeast Surge Pond (SESP) following reclamation will provide important information for better estimating the effort and time required to manage selenium treatment after mine closure. Benga expects that these more precise estimates will be used to inform the Mine Financial Security Program (MFSP) administered by the Government of Alberta. Benga has provided estimates of reclamation costs, including long -term management of selenium treatment structures in its response to JRP IR-5.33 (Addendum 10, JRP IR Information Request Packa ge #5 from the Joint Review Panel to Benga, Information Request 5. 4. (CIAR #215). Tenth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. Response to Information Request 5.4 and 5.23 (d), Appendix 5.4-1. (CIAR #251). Comments from the Government of Canada Environment and Climate Change Canada and Fisheries and Oceans Canada submissions. (CIAR #283). Comments from Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society Southern Alberta. (CIAR #284). Benga's response to comments on sufficiency. (CIAR #291). Information Requ est 5.4 (CIAR #215) outlined the requirements for a draft aquatic monitoring plan relating to monitoring, mitigation, adaptive management, and overall study design and analysis. Benga's response to IR 5.4 (CIAR #251) did not provide all of the information requested. Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Environment and Climate Change Canada (CIAR #283) also noted that the response was in. Specifically, the following deficiencies were noted: IR 5.4 a): a lack of details on adaptive management, instead outlining ge neral concepts in an adaptive management plan (CIAR #283); IR 5.4 a): no description of past successful application of adaptive management and no response to parts a) i, ii, iii, iv and vi (CIAR #284); IR 5.4 c): no information on baseline monitoring provi ded. The Fisheries and Aquatic Monitoring Plan (Section 6.5, Appendix 5.4-1) did not contain details on the establishment of an accurate baseline assessment for water quality (CIAR #283); and IR 5.4 d): while mention is made of monitoring the population trends in Westslope Cutthroat Trout (Section 6.6 of Appendix 5.4-1) there is no discussion provided on how long- term trends will be evaluated and adverse effects mitigated for other aquatic components (water quality, algae, benthic invertebrates and fish health; (CIAR #283). Given these gaps in info rmation, there is uncertainty that potential effects to the aquatic environment can be adequately identified via monitoring, or mitigated via adaptive management. Further, given the lack of definitive reference areas and lack of details on BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 233 how baseline data will be incorporated into the Aquatic Monitoring Plan, it is unclear how effective the monitoring program will be at detecting potential changes in the receiving environment. The Panel requires that Benga provide a draft Aquatic Monitoring Plan that addresses the information previously requested. This will allow the Panel to evaluate Benga's ability to detect potential changes in water quality, validate assessment predictions, and evaluate management measures to m itigate potential adverse effects. The Panel understands that the final plan would be finalized with appropriate regulatory agencies, such as Fisheries and Oceans Canada, but requires a complete draft version of the plan at this time, as was initially requested. Response: An updated Draft Aquatic Monitoring Plan (AMP) is attached to this response as Appendix 6.23-1, which incorporates the information requested as more particularly discussed below. a)Provide project -specific details on adaptive management and mitigation specifically addressing the following points (as requested in IR 5.4 a): i.potential effects of the project that require mitigation; Response: The potential Project effects on westslope cutthroat trout and the downstream aquatic environments of Blairmore Creek, Gold Creek, and the Crowsnest River that require mitigation are summarized in Section 4.0, Figure 4.0-1, and in Section 5.0, Table 5.0-1 of the updated AMP (Appendix 6.23- 1). ii.uncertainties that necessitate the use of adaptive managem ent including, supporting evidence on the efficacy of proposed adaptive management measures; Response: Uncertainties that necessitate the use of adaptive management are described in Section 7.1 of the AMP ( Appendix 6.23- 1) and are related to the following elements of the EIA analysis that have led to the current assessment that the effects of the Project on the aquatic environment are not significant: Representativeness of input data - the EIA analysis is based on information about the Project from sampl ing that may not be representative of Project conditions. For example, the amount of selenium present in the waste rock is from a limited number of rock samples. If these samples turn out to be not representative, the total amount of selenium loading could be greater or smaller. Other assumptions used for modelling the Project - Some parts of the EIA analysis are based on assumptions using professional judgement and where possible,BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 234 conservative bias. There is a possibility that these assumptions may be i ncorrect and lead to unexpected impacts. Errors and omissions - Although the EIA analysis has been conducted with care and using quality control procedures to minimize errors, there is always a possibility thaterrors and omissions could lead to outcomes t hat are not currently foreseen. Unforeseen external factors - During the Project life, it is possible that currentlyunforeseen external or environmental changes could work to create a cumulative effectwith the Project that is not included in the EIA analysis. With respect to the efficacy of proposed adaptive management measures, all of the uncertainties listed above will lead to a deviation from baseline data or a deviation from the results predicted in the EIA. The AMP's mitigation effectiveness evaluat ion and adaptive management approach will focus on establishing indicators and thresholds according to bas eline characterization, improved practices based on research and monitoring results, and input from the public engagement and Indigenous consultation programs. As the Project proceeds, monitoring throughout all Project phases will allow water quality targ ets to be reviewed and, if necessary, modifications can be made to site expectations. Mitigation effectiveness evaluation and adaptive management is a planned and systematic process for continuously improving environmental management practices by learning about their outcomes. Mitigation effectiveness evaluation and adaptive management provides flexibility to identify and implement new mitigation measu res or to modify existing ones during the life of a project. Benga's program is organized into four main components, which are reevaluated and reassessed in a feedback loop: Assess the Problem Adaptive Management Process Design Implement, Monitor, and Evaluate Adjust the Mitigation as Required iii.proposed mitigation measures, mitigation objectives and associated predischarge mitigation performance indicators to be used in order to confirm the effectiveness of mitigation; Response: Proposed mitigation measures associated with effluent characterization and water quality monitoring are provided in the updated AMP in Section 5.0, Table 5.0-1 and in Section 6.1 (Appendix 6.23-1). BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 235 iv.details on receiving environment monitoring stressor indicators and effects indicators, including sampling location, frequency, and supporting information; Additional infor mation on the receiving environment monitoring stressor indicators and effects indicators are provided in the following sections of the updated AMP (Appendix 6.23-1): Section 6.1 - Water Quality Monitoring Section 6.2 - Aquatic Effects Monitoring Section 6.3 - Calcite Monitoring Section 6.4 - Groundwater/Surface Water Monitoring Section 6.5 - Hydrology Monitoring Section 6.6 - Westslope Cutthroat Trout Population Monitoring Section 6.7 - Bioenergetics Monitoring v.supporting evidence, including reference to relevant examples, on the efficacy of the proposed mitigation measures described in (iii), along with contingency measures that are technically and economically feasible should the mitigations implemented in (iii) prove to be ineffective; and Response: Additional informati on on efficac y of the proposed mitigation measures are provided i n Table 5.0-1 of the upda ted AMP (Appendix 6.23-1). Contingency measures or adaptive management options for each of the proposed mitigation measures, should the planned mitigations prove to be ineffective, are provided in Table 7.5-1 of the updated AMP (Appendix 6.23-1). Supporting evidence on the effi cacy of the saturated backfill zone-specific and gravel bed reactor-specific m itigation measures are provided in Addendum 10, JRP IR-5.5, C IAR#251 and in the res ponse to JRP IR-6.18, r espectively. vi. methods to be used to develop thresholds that would trigger implementation of mitigation measures or adaptive management measures (e.g., a series of risk based thresholds rangin g from triggering confirmation of exceedance of guidelines, to confirming cause/effect, to triggering deployment of alternate or additional mitigation). Response: Methods to be used to develop thresholds that would trigger implementation of mitigation measures or adaptive management measures are provided in the updated AMP (Appendix 6.23-1) in Section 6.1.2.6 (for water quality) and in Section 7.0, which presents the Project's draft Mitigation Effectiveness Evaluation and Adaptive Management approach. b)Discuss Benga's application of adaptive management to mitigate unanticipated environmental effects during project construction, operation, decommissioningBENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 236 and/or reclamation, using examples from past mining, or other mining projects, to demonstrate Benga's understanding and ability to effectively implement adaptive management. Response: As indicated in the updated AMP in Section 7.0 ( Appendix 6.23-1), Benga will incorporate adaptive management techniques as routine components in all of its environmental management activities. These techniques provide the opportunity to develop and fine-tune the monitoring program using data collected on- site and from other regional operators. Benga will use the experience gained during the development of the Project, and othe r successes by the regional coal operators over the next 24 years, to manage and implement an effective monitoring program. Benga will work with other operators of coal mines, AEP, AER, DFO, ECCC, and local stakeholders, to further develop criteria and monitoring programs that clearly demonstrate the protection of aquatic ecosystems. With respect to Project mitigation effectiveness evaluation and adaptive management, Benga is committed to achieving continual improvement in environmental performance. The development and implementation of all monitoring and mitigation identified for the Project and housed in the monitoring and follow-up programs will be tracked in relevant managem ent plans. As site conditions and monitoring dictate, or as new technology emerges, Benga will adaptively manage its site practices and monitoring program to meet the defined objectives. For some programs this would involve regular evaluation of predictive models; which would be clearly defined in each applicable management plan. In summary, if a monitoring and mitigation effectiveness evaluation identify that adverse environmental effects are greater than predicted, Benga will then evaluate whether they result in changes to the conclusions presented in the effects assessment. If changes are confirmed, Benga will then evaluate the need for revised mitigation actions and management practices to manage effects. Where the need for revised mitigations is identified, they will be further developed and implemented. As Benga was formed sp ecifically for the purposes of developing and executing the proposed Grassy Mountain Project, the Company does not have corporate history or examples from past mining projects to use as examples to demonstrate these points. c)Provide details on sampling design, including how the baseline dataset will be established and used during monitoring. Response: Benga has incorporated details around Baseline Characterization for the vario us components to be monitored in the updated AMP (Appendix 6.23-1). BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 237 d) Provide a description of how long- term aquatic trends associated with construction, operation, decommissioning and reclamation of the mine will be identified and mitigated; with conside ration of year to year variability within the aquatic ecosystems in Gold and Bl airmore Creek. Response: Benga has taken into consideration the proposed Environmental Effects Monitoring (EEM) framework that ECCC are proposing as part of the Coal Mining Effluent Regulations, when developing the AMP. The proposed EEM is proposing annua l reports on effluent characte rization, water quality, and sublethal toxicity, with biological related reports (e.g., fish population studies, aquatic effects, etc.) every three years. Their rationale for these timelines is based on the ability to provide annual trends for parameters that require actions on a shorter time frame, versus other parameters that will take multiple seasons to determine a defensible trend. Benga proposes to adopt this reporting schedule, which will also provide consistency with the EEM and the proposed Coal Mining Effluent Regulations when they come into force; the anticipated date is 2022. Information Request 6.24 Information Request Package #5 from the Joint Review Panel to Benga, Information Request 5.7. (CIAR #215). Tenth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment. Response to Information Request 5.7. (CIAR #251). Tenth Addendum to the Environmental #251). IR 5.7 (CIAR that Benga provide calculated pr obabilities for Westslope Cutthroat Trout egg selenium concentrations within the predicted range of concentrations, and provide a justification for why an uncertainty factor was not applied to Benga's proposed site-specific water selenium guideline. Benga responded by outlining the conservative assumptions included within its bioaccumulation model, and stated that application of an uncertainty factor would be an arbitrary policy decision not based in science (CIAR #251). The Panel understands that water concentrations of selenium do not directly reflect risks of selenium ecotoxicity to fish and that tissue concentrations (egg/ovary concentrations) are more directly correlated with risk. The Panel also understands that selenium bioaccumulation and subsequent concentrations in egg/ovary tissue is highly site - specific and species -specific, and depends on such factors as the presence of lotic/lentic water bodies. Baseline information regarding selenium concentrations in water, sediment, and aquatic biota, particu larly Westslope Cutthroat Trout, in Blairmore and Gold creeks are very limited. As previously noted in the rationale for IR 5.7 (CIAR #215), uncertainty factors (UF) are applied when site- specif ic data are limited and when uncertainties in modeled data exist, which is the case for this assessment. Examples of BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 238 the application of an uncertainty factor are the Alberta selenium egg/ovary tissue guidelines (11 \u00b5g/g dw with an UF of 2 applied) and Canadian Council for Ministers of the Environment recommendation s of applying safety factors when deriving guideline values. Furthermore, the presence of Westslope Cutthroat Trout, a species at risk, also supports the application of an uncertainty factor. Collection of site -specific data to support and refine conceptual and lab- based models for selenium bioaccumulation may serve to partially reduce existing uncertainty. The draft Fisheries and Aquatic Monitoring Plan (Appendix 5.4-1) outlines how some of this information would be collected, although Benga acknowledged that challenges exist in collecting substantial data in support of modeled predictions, such as fish tissue selenium concentrations. Confirmation of effects and mitigation through the plan would require substantial time to implement, and in the interim the project could pose the risk of permanent, irreversible harm to biota in receiving streams. Given the above uncertainties, the Panel requires a more fulsome understanding of the potential risks associated with a site-specific objective for selenium. Specif ically, the Panel would like to understand the spatial and temporal extent within the LSA where the established 2 g/L water quality guideline for selenium would be exceeded, should the Project proceed as designed. a)Provide detailed information on the locations within the aquatics Local Study Area predicted to exceed a water selenium concentration of 2 g/L under all phases of the Project as currently proposed. Use the results of the modeling of mean monthly selenium concentrations provided in IR 6.26, as appropriate. Response: Surface water quality models were updated (from EIA submission , CIAR #42) to include hydrological and climate change inputs for the local study area (LSA) including Blairmore Creek and Gold Creek in order to address the JRP IR-6.25. In order to mitigate impacts on the flow rates in Blairmore Creek, the effluent from the water tre atment ponds is directed to three model nodes in Blairmore Creek (BC -07, BL-02, and BC-03, see below). The attempt to return the contact water to the nodes generally from where it was collected is intended to minimize changes in flow conditions. However, no effluent is being directed to Gold Creek. Water quality prediction nodes in the LSA were strategically selected to best support project effects on the receiving environment ( e.g., downstream of treatment zone/sedimentation ponds) throughout the projec t's life cycle. Water quality prediction s were made in the following nodes: On Blairmore Creek: lower Blairmore Creek at its mouth (BC -01); downstream of Saturated Treatment Zone (BC -03); downstream of Raw Water Pond (BL-02); down stream of West Sediment ation Pond (BC -07); andBENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 239 upstream control node (BL-03). On Gold Creek: lower Gold Creek at its mouth (GC -01); downstream of Southeast Surge Pond (GC-02); downstream of East Sedimentation Pond (GC-04); downstream of Northeast Sedimentation Pond (GC-10); and upstream control node (GC-13). Predicted selenium concentrations are presented in the response to JRP IR -6.25, Figure 6.25-4 and Figure 6.25-5 for Blairmore Creek and Gold Creek nodes, respectively. Concentrations are presented for all phases of mine cycle and compared against the gener ic AB/BC selenium guideline of 2 \u00b5g/L for the protection of aquatic life, as well as the proposed sulphate- based site - specific selenium objective, given Benga has proposed various mitigation measures to comply with this obj ective. Screening Against the AB/ BC Guideline: all nodes in Blairmore Creek except upstream control node (BL -03) are predicted to exceed the Alberta selenium guideline during the second half of operation and entire closure and post -closure phases (Figure 6.25-4; Table 6.24- 1); and predicted selenium concentrations at all nodes in Gold Creek are below the Albertaselenium guideline of 2 \u00b5g/L during all mine phases during closure and post-closurephases of the mine (Figure 6.25-5; Table 6.24- 1). Screening Aga inst th e Site -specific Objective: Predicted selenium concentrations at all nodes in Blairmore Creek are below the proposed site-s pecific selenium objective, and below the BC and AB guideline of 2 \u00b5g/L during all mine phases ( Figures 6.25-4 and 6.25-5, respectively; Table 6.24-1).

Response: All nodes in Gold Creek remain below a selenium concentration of 2 \u00b5g/L in all mine phase s due to proposed mitigation measures. Predicted selenium concentrations at all nodes in Blairmore Creek (except the upstream node) exceed this threshold but remain below the proposed site- specific selenium objective. In order to provide conservative esti mates of selenium concentrations in the mine -affected water, the water balance model has not taken into account the beneficial eff ects of reclamation of the ex-pit waste rock areas. In addition, the design decision to locate waste rock disposal areas at higher elevations to avoid excessive percolation of water through the dumps is novel and the performance of these waste rock disposal sites, post reclamation had not been fully proven. Without additional information based on actual performance of the waste rock disposal areas post reclamation, the water balance model cannot accurately predict when the locations identified in part a) would be expected to decrease below 2 \u00b5g/L. Benga has proposed to begin reclamation of the South Rock Dump as early as year 7 of operations. Therefore, it is likely that the data required to predict the effects of reclamation on future selenium concentrat ions will be available by year 10 or 12 of operations. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 241 Information Request 6.25 Grassy Mountain Coal Project Updated Environmental Impact Assessment. Appendix 10b - Water and Load Balance Model. (CIAR #42). Comments from Tsuut'ina Nation. (CIAR #220). Tenth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Statement. Response to Information Request 5.8. (CIAR #251). Seasonal variation of contaminant concentrations was documented in the surface water quality baseline study; however, predicted contaminant concentrations in the receiving environment do not include seasonal variation (Appendix 10b, CIAR#42). A comprehensive effects assessment requires an understanding of seasonal variation of contaminant concentrations because some life stages (e.g. fish embryos) are more sensitive to contaminants (e.g. selen ium) than others. If the presence of sensitive life stages corresponds w ith seasonally -high concentrations, the potential for adverse effects increases. Benga stated in its response to IR 5.8 (CIAR #251) that selenium concentrations in the receiving environment will vary with specific periods of its operation, peaking at closure. Model results presented in (Appendix 10b, CIAR #42) show that sulphate, selenium, cobalt and zinc, then remain elevated in Blairmore Creek and Gold Creek for the remaining modeled time period (to the year 2100). Given that Benga has stated that post- mitigation mean annual concentrations of some contaminants in the receiving environment will exceed existing water quality guidelines and that in some cases exceedances will increase and then persist with time, mean annual estimates are an insufficient basis upon which to determine the potential adverse effects on aquatic life. It is particularly important that the potential for adverse effects to Westslope Cutthroat Trout, which is listed as 'Threatened' in Alberta under the Species at Risk Act, is estimated with confidence, using a good understanding of seasonal variability. In addition, the combined effects of the elevated contaminant concentrations (including any ameliorating effects of parameters such as sulphate on toxicity of selenium) may vary with time, resulting in variable likelihood of adverse effects. a)Provide modeled estimates of mean monthly concentrations of contaminants of concern in Blairmore Creek and Gold Creek using available hydrographs and reasonable assumptions given the hydrologic period-of-record and the proximity of gauging stations. The use of synthetic hydrographs may be required. Conduct the modeling for the mine operation, at closure and post -closure. The post-closure period should include effects of climate change on variabili ty of seasonal water flows. Response: Figure 6.25-1 and Figure 6.25-2 show updated hydrology for Gold Creek and Blairmore Creek on a mean monthly basis with climate change incorporated in the updated hydrological inputs. Modelled estimates of mean monthly concentrations of contaminants of concern in Blairmore Creek and Gold Creek for this flow scenario are graphed in Appendix 6.25-1. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 242 Figure 6.25-3 shows model results for total selenium concentration in Blairmore Creek under mean monthly flow scenarios over the 20 -year time span during operations to illustrate the seasonal variation while Figure 6.25-4 and Figure 6.25-5 show the same results data for Blairmore and Gold creeks respectively but for an 80- year time span. As indicated by the graphs, selenium concentrations in the creeks, modelled on a mean monthly basis, are significantly more variable than those that had been previously calculated based on annual average flows. Peak selenium levels in Blairmore Creek under this flow scenario are approximately 9 \u00b5g/ L, which is slightly higher than the annual average calculation of 7 \u00b5g/ L but still lower than the proposed Project- specific guideline for selenium. b) Provide a sensitivity analysis of the effects of varying model inputs of the following five paramete rs: i.Percentage removal in the saturated backfill zone (using a reasonable range of percent removal rates based upon available information); Response: Figure 6.25-6 shows model results for total selenium concentrations in Blairmore Creek assuming 95% removal of selenium in the saturated backfill zones. Water quality in Gold Creek is not affected by the assumed attenuation in the saturated backfill zones because treated effluent is only directed to Blairmore Creek. Figure 6.25-7 shows model results for a scenario that assumes 90% attenuation. Obviously, under both scenarios, 90% and 95% removal of selenium, the resulting concentrations of selenium in Blairmore Creek are unacceptable at 70 \u00b5g/L and 35 \u00b5g/ L, respectively. However, it is important to note that selenium levels are not forecast to exceed 10 \u00b5g/ L, even in the 90% case, until 10 years after the start of operations. This is because, the rate of selenium leaching will be proportional to the amount of rock stored in the rock dump, which will increase through the years with mine activity. In addition, there is a delay between placement of rock in the waste rock disposal and presence of selenium in the affected water due to the time required for the rock to be wetted. Durin g these 10 years after mi ne start -up, Benga will be monitoring the selenium removal rates in the SBZ as well as selenium concentrations in the surge ponds and raw water pond. If there is an indication that removal rates will not achieve the targeted 99% o r that selenium concentra tions in untreated water are higher than expected, Benga will have several years to resolve the situation through operational adjustments to the SBZ or to implement another contingency plan to prevent unacceptably high selenium levels in Blairmore Creek. Note that the removal rate of selenium in the SBZ does not affect any of the other COPCs studied for the Project. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 243 ii. Extreme climate events (select specific events which would result in substantially elevated concentrations of contaminants of concern in s urface water (e.g. severe drought over at least one season); The 40-year synthetic flow record used for the hydrological input to the model (as shown in Figures 6.25-1 and 6.25-2) represents a wide range of climatic conditions and as such provides a good indication of how climatic conditions could affect water quality in Blairmore Creek and Gold Creek. As such, the peak selenium levels in the range of 9 \u00b5g/L shown in Figure 6.25-4 for Blairmore Creek occur during a multi-year dry period. Conversely, selenium ranges both prior to and after this dry period exhibit selenium concentrations closer to 6 \u00b5g/ L. iii.Contact water capture and attenuation of the contaminants of potential concern (COPCs) which are predicted to exceed water quality guidelines; i.e., selenium, nitrate, sulphate, cobalt, zinc, and any other COPCs with mean monthly concentrations predicted to exceed guidelines (using a reasonable range of variability of capture and attenuation as influenced by factors such as seasonal flows); Figure 6.25-8 and Figure 6.25-9 show model results of total selenium concentrations in Blairmore Creek for scenarios that assume 90% and 80% capture of all contact water. The base case scenario for the EA model assumed 95% capture. A reduction in capture efficiency does not significantly affect concentrations in Gold Creek. Only nitrate, nitrite and selenium are assumed to be removed in the saturated zones. Loadings of remaining parameters are assumed to pass though the saturated zones unaffected. This means that the same total load of those parameters ends up reporting to the creeks whether it flows directly ( i.e., uncaptured) or it is routed via the saturated zones. As indicated in part bi) of this response, it is important to note that even with the lower captu re rates, water quality in Blairmore Creek does not exceed 10 \u00b5g/ L (lower than the proposed site-specific water quality guideline for selenium) for the first decade of operation. Benga will be monitoring wat er quality in Blairmore Creek and will be able to detect any un- foreseen changes in water quality early and have several years to react with additional mitigative measures. iv. Acid generating pit walls (using the range of acid generating potential as determined during Benga's baseline geological and ge ochemical studies); and Response: Results for a model scenario that assumes 100% acidic pit walls are included in Appendix 6.25-2. No additional mitigation such as post- treatment of SBZ disc harge was implemented. Modelled concentrations of dissolved meta ls generally increased but the increases were typically marginal as illustrated in Figure 6.25-10 and Figure 6.25-11 , which show total BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 244 zinc concentration in Blairmore Creek for the 100% acidic pit walls scenario and the non- acidic pit wall scenario. v. Varying the volumes of water which may have to be recycled back to the saturated backfill zone if it does not meet discharge criteria. Response: This IR was addressed as follows: for each year in the model simulation, one month was selected randomly as the month in which all effluent from the saturated zones would be recycled back for additional treatment. The volume of water that would otherwise have been discharged in that month was discharg ed over the following 3 months (along with the regular discharges for those following 3 months). Figure 6.25-12 shows results for total selenium concentrations in Blairmore Creek as a result of the irregular discharge pattern. Results for other parameters (Co, SO 4 and Zn) are included in Appendix 6.25-3. The peak sel enium concentration under this scenario was slightly higher than the base case. However, it should be noted that the peak selenium concentration in Blairmore Creek occurs during a multi- year dry period during which it is likely that additional water management steps could be taken to discharge the extra water over a longer timeframe than 4 months to further mitigate the upset scenario. In any case, the peak selenium level under this scenario remains below the proposed site- specific water quality guideline for selenium. c)Re-assess residual adverse effects on surface water quality using the mean monthly model predictions, including results of sensitivity analysis, and re-assess the likelihood of significant residual adverse effects on surface water quality by comparing results to Environmental Quality Guidelines for Alberta Surface Waters (2018) 6. If Alberta guidelines do not exist for a particular COPC, compare results to the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) guidelines for the prote ction of aquatic life7. Monthly predictions must also be used in the re - assessment of risk to aquatic life, as requested in IR 6.24. Response: The residual adverse effects on surface water quality using the mean monthly model predictions are not materially different from those discussed in the EIA's water quality assessment (EIA 2016, Consultant Report #4, CIAR#42). Water quality issues due to P roject activities will be addressed by applying appropriate mitigation measures including treatment of nitrate and selenium in a n SBZ plus treatment of other metals in a Water Treatment Plant (WTP) if 6 Available online: Environmental Quality Guidelines for Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) Guidelines for the Protection of Aquatic Life. http://st- ts.ccme.ca/en/index.html. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 245 necessary. After mitigation, effects of these water qu ality issues on receiving environment are assessed as not significant in both Gold Creek and Blairmore Creek. Sulphate concentrations in Blairmore Creek are predicted to exceed the hardness -dependent sulphate guideline value of 429 mg/L for a maximum hardn ess level of 250 mg/L, as well as a published no- effect -threshold of 725 mg/L during late mine life and persisting long term. Therefore, use of a site -specific sulphate objective based on site water hardness is recommended. Selenium concentrations in Blai rmore Creek are predicted to exceed the Alberta Guideline of 2 \u00b5g/l about 12 years after start of construction (year 10 of operations). However, the selenium concentrations are below the proposed site- specific water quality objective for selenium in Appendix A1, CR#5 of the EA ( CIAR#42) for all years. Both selenium and sulphate are below the Alberta guidelines in Gold Creek since contact water, processed through the SBZ and, if necessary, a WTP, is not discharged to Gold Creek. Selenium levels are slightl y lower in this analysis than were reported in the EA because the EPL is no longer assumed to discharge to Gold Creek. All COPCs with the exception of selenium are unaffected by the sensitivity analyses related to capture percentage or selenium attenuation in the SBZ. Furthermore, Gold Creek is not affected by these sensitivities since contact water not captured wo uld primarily continue to report to Blairmore Creek. In Blairmore Creek, the concentration of selenium would rise above the proposed site- specific water quality objective for selenium around end of mining for capture rate sensitivities and for selenium att enuation of 95%. If selenium attenuation is only 90%, the site- specific objective would be surpassed in year 10. As indicated above, Benga wil l monitor selenium concentrations in the creeks as well as the SBZ discharge and in upstream ponds to have an early indication if there is an issue with capture percentage or attenuation rate in the SBZ. If early indications point to a long- term selenium concentration of concern, Benga will implement its adaptive management plan which may include additional treatme nt for selenium in a plant or through a GBR in order to achieve the objective. Sensitivities related to acidic pit walls resulted in modelled concentrations of dissolved metals generally increased but the increases were typically marginal and not significant. Similarly, the sensitivity analysis related to irregular operation of the SBZ did not reveal significantly different results from the base case.

Comments from the Government of Canada Environment and Climate Change Canada submission. (CIAR #283). When asked to characterize the effects on all potentially affected aquatic and wildlife receptors in the Oldman Reservoir, Benga estimated, in the response to IR 5.29 (CIAR #251), that the selenium concentration in the Oldman Reservoir would be 0.6 g/L based on contributing watershed areas and current selenium concentrations. Benga stated that the predicted selenium concentration in the Oldman Reservoir is well below the selenium guideline even when using conservative assumptions, and that there were negligible risks in the reservoir due to the predictions for Blairmore Creek. However, in the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) evaluation of IR 5.9 d)(CIAR #283), ECCC indicated that the calculation of selenium accumulation provided by Benga is erroneous, and that it is inadequate to simply multiply the concentration of selenium in the river by loadi ng volume to estimate selenium loading in the reservoir. Timberwolf Wilderness Society (CIAR #281) noted that the selenium model for the proposed Project could be validated against the observed selenium data for the Fording, Elk, and Kootenay rivers in Bri tish Columbia, and Lake Koocanusa. a)Using publicly available information, provide as much of the following baseline information for the Oldman Reservoir as possible in order to provide context for the assessment of the risk of selenium loadings: Response: The following information has been compiled from publicly ava ilable information to provide context for the assessment of the risk of selenium loading in the Oldman Reservoir. Note that subcomponents ii and iv have been combined as one response. i.a characterization of surface water quality, including water temperature profiles (in order to establish the degree and extent of any thermal stratification), turbidity, hardness, nutrient concentrations, major ion concentrations, andBENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 247 concentrations of contami nants of potential concern (COPCs) including selenium; Response: An extensive online literature search was conducted to summarize water quality data and information for the Oldman Reservoir. Information sources were mainly explored to characterize baselin e surface water quality for the Reservoir (sources are noted in the Reference section). Alberta Government's water quality data included open -water season (May to October) consecutive yearly data from 1991 to 1996 and then 2005 and 2015. Water quality var iables included conventional physicochemical variables, major nutrients, and major ions. Temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles, as well metals data, were obtained from Mitchell (2001) that included data from 1991 to 1996. It should be noted that sampling locations were not consistent over the years and t herefore results presented based on these data are regarded as general/overall trends of the Oldman Reservoir. Although there is limited recent water quality data for the Oldman Reservoir, available d ata indicate that the Oldman Reservoir is currently oligotrophic (low nutrients, chl- a), clear (low TSS, DOC), well -oxygenated, weakly stratified, with an alkaline pH range and high hardness and alkalinity. Moderate concentrations of major ions are dominated by calcium, bicarbonate, and sulphate. Concentrati ons of most metals (including selenium and mercury) measured in years following reservoir establishment were generally low and below water quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life with few exceptions ( e.g., total aluminum). Trends for the major water quality variables in the Oldman Reservoir are summarized below: Temperature and Dissolved Oxygen Profiles Temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles for the Oldman Reservoir during open- water season in 1992 to 1996 are shown in Figures 6.26- 1A and 6.26- 1B (copied from Mitchell 2001). The Oldman Reservoir demonstrated weak or temporary thermal stratification over the summer due to disruption of the thermocline by high volume of inflow water and removal of cool water from the hypolimnion via the outflow. Wind events also likely contribute to water mixing observed to considerable depths. Outflow temperatures of the reservoir ranged from 5\u00b0C (spring) to 15\u00b0C (fall) during open -water seasons from 1 994 to 1996. The lowest temperature in the bottom and the outflow would likely be a few degrees above freezing even during the coldest part of winter. There was no statistical relationship between water level and outflow temperature. Dissolved oxygen (D O) concentrations remained fairly uniform from the surface to the bottom of the reservoir, and were generally above 70% saturation, even at the bottom. Lowest recorded DO concentrations were 0.10 to 0.17 mg/L , within the 4 m of the bottom on June 8, 1995, just after river inflow to the reservoir peaked du ring the flood event. However, at 6 m above the BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 248 bottom at that time, the DO concentration was high (9.2 mg/L ). Although there was no temperature gradient at these depths, it is likely that cool, silty river water moved along the bottom, and organic matte r in the water created an oxygen demand. Dissolved oxygen was also low (3.34 mg/L ) on September 13, 1994 at 62 m depth. For all years except 1995, the lowest concentrations at the bottom occurred in late August or early September when water temperatures were highest. DO concentrations at reservoir outflow were always above 8.9 mg/L . Conventional Physicochemical Variables Temporal trends of major physicochemical variables are presented in Figures 6.26- 2A and 6.26-2B . Levels of lab -measured specific conductivity were stable and moderate in range throughout the monitoring years with an average value of 310 \u00b5S/cm in the most recent recorded year (2015). Lab -measured pH was always in alkaline range with a value of 8.0 in 2015. Total hardness and alkalinit y levels (on average, 160 and 140 mg/L in 2015, respectively) indicate Oldman Reservoir has relatively hard water with high buffering capacity and low acid sensitivity. Levels of non- filterable residue (T SS) were higher and unstable during initial years but became stable and low in 2015 (on average 2 mg/L). Secchi depth, indicating the water transparency, reflected a similar trend to TSS, with an average value of 2 m. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), indicative of water colour, decreased over the years and remained very low in 2015 (2 mg/L). Major Ions Temporal trends of major ions are Figures , . Concentrations of filterable residue (TDS) were stable and moderate in range across monitoring years, with an average value of 170 mg/L in 2015. Calcium was the dominant cation followed by magnesium, sodium, and potassium. Bicarbonate and sulphate were the dominant anions. Consistent with TDS, concentr ations of all major anions and cat ions were stable throughout the monitoring years. Major Nutrients, Chlorophyll a, and Trophic State Temporal trends of major nutrients in the Oldman Reservoir are presented in Figure 6.26-3D . Total phosphorus (TP) concent rations were highly variable in Oldman Reservoir during 1991 to 1996, covering the range of aquatic productivity classifications from oligotrophic availab le data (2005 and 2015) show that TP concentrations declined and stabilized over time to oligotrophic levels (average TP concentration 0.007 mg/L). Total largely bioavailable comprised 43% of TP on average. Total nitrogen (TN) concentrations also were highly variable in initial years but had stabilized at low levels by 2005 (average TN 0.24 mg/L ) and 2015 (average TN 0.31 mg/L). Concentrations of individual inorganic nitrogen species ( i.e., total ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite) often were below analytical detection limits. Chlorophyll a concentrations (indicative of algal biomass) BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 249 demonstrated similar trends to nutrients, also reflecting oligotrophic status in recent data (i.e., <2.5 \u00b5g/L chlorophyll a). Metals Average concentrations of total metals in the water column of the Oldman Reservoir from 1991 to 1996 are presented in Table 6.26-1 , along with exceedances of relevant water quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life at that time. More recent me tals data could not be found. Concentrations of most metals including arsenic, copper, iron, mercury, molybdenum, selenium, and nickel were below the guidelines. Only total aluminum concentrations exceeded their guideline in about half of samples analyze d, only in 1994 (Alberta no longer has a total aluminum guideline, having replaced it with a guideline for dissolved aluminum). Other metals also sporadically exceeded guidelines ( e.g., iron, lead, copper), at concentrations near guideline values. Concen trations of most metals without guidelines were low or near detection limits. Selenium concentrations were at or below the analytical detection limit in all samples.

Response: Based on thorough search and review of publicly available sources, fisheries- specific studies/information for the Reservoir following establishment of t he Oldman Reservoir is sparse. Of the limited reports availab le, fish species documented in the reservoir include: Bull Trout, Westslope Cutthroat Trout (WSCT), Rainbow Trout, Mountain Whitefish, Lake Whitefish, Burbot, Brown Trout, Northern Pike, Longnose Dace, Sucker, Longnose Sucker and Brook Stickleback (ASRD 2012, Campen 2016, Lima et al. 2016, Moore et al. 1993, Warnock - as cited in Hurkett 2009). Bull trout (Saskatchewan - Nelson Rivers populations) are present in the Oldman Reservoir and classified as \"Threatened\" under Alberta's Wildlife Act and Sche dule 1 of the federal Species at Risk Act . The stock(s) inhabiting the Oldman River system have declined since the completion of the Oldman River Dam in 1991. Bull trout were abundant in the reservoir in 1991 (Moore et al. 1993), but severely declined fi ve years post -completion (Lima et al. 2016). Even with the noticeable Bull Trout decline in the reservoir, a small population of adfluvial and resident Bull Trout (population estimate of 250 to 1,000 individuals) appear to persist in the Reservoir (ASRD 2012, Warnock in Hurkett 2009). Westslope Cutthroat Trout are listed as \"Threatened\" under the Species at Risk Act and were abundant in the area prior to Oldman River Dam construction. Within five years of the Oldman River Dam Project, WSCT nearly disappeared from the reservoir area (Lima et al. 1993). Although the governments of Alberta (Alberta Westslope Cutthroat Trout Recovery Team 2013) and Canada (DFO 2014, DFO 2019) have developed a recovery plan and strategy for WSCT, Oldman Reservoir was not identified as critical habitat. With the abundance of rainbow trout in the Oldman Reservoir (Moore et al. 1993), it is likely that there are very few purestrain WSCT in this area, given the high occurrence of hybridization between rainbow trout and WSCT. Several other fish species are documented within the reservoir; however, there are no records or studies that specifically discuss their abundance and/or status. Given the Oldman Reservoir is a lentic system, species with generalist traits for reproductive req uirements ( i.e., tolerant to a wide BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 252 range of flows, open substratum, non- migratory) increased in relative abundance following completion of the Oldman Dam (Lima at al. 2016), including White Sucker, Longnose Sucker, Longnose Dace, Brook Stickleback and Northern Pike. Although Brown Trout, Mountain Whitefish and Lake Whitefish are present within the area (Moore et al. 1993, Campen 2016), no records of species/population abundance could be found in the public record. The presence/characterization of lower t rophic communities inhabiting the Oldman Reservoir appears to be limited to a graduate (MSc) thesis recently completed (Campen 2016) and a more dated limnological study (Mitchell 2001). Oldman Reservoir is an oligotrophic lake with a relatively high flush ing rate and short residency time of water (0.17 years) due to the abundance of low nutrient rivers feeding into the reservoir (Campen 2016, Mitchell 2001). Short water residence time can have a washout effect on nutrients released into the water column a nd limit deposition of fine sediments, potentially affecting zooplankton communities and nutrient loading within the reservoir (Campen 2016). Macrophytes were not documented in Oldman Rese rvoir 2016). Additional information discussing the presenc e/absence of periphytic algae within the reservoir was not found within the public record. Given the oligotrophic status of the waterbody, it is expected that abundance of any periphytic a lgae is low. Nine zooplankton taxa the reservoirs sampled by Campen (2016), Oldman Reservoir consistently had the lowest zooplankton biomass 0.03 g/m 3. No studies or reports found in the public domain presented information characterizing benthic invertebrate communities within the Oldman Reservoir. b)Calculate monthly and annual se lenium loadings to Blairmore Creek and Gold Creek, and subsequently to the Crowsnest River and the Oldman Reservoir, over the life of the mine and into the post closure period up to the year 2100. Benga may choose to use the Water and Load Balance Model (referenced in Appendix 10b of CIAR #42) with appropriate modificatio ns which allow credible and reliable estimates of loading to the Oldman Reservoir. Hydrographs of seasonal surface water flow over the entire available period of record should be the basis for the loading calculations. Mean annual as well as mean monthly l oading estimates should be produced and subsequently used to calculate mean annual as well as mean monthly selenium concentrations in the Oldman Reservoir. The predicted range of post-mitigation selenium concentrations at the most downstream locations in Blairmore Creek and Gold Creek over the life of mine as well as at closure and in the post-closure period should be used as input to the modeled loadings to the Reservoir . It is insufficient to produce one mean annual estimate of selenium loadings and conce ntrations in the Oldman Reservoir. Include details regarding how the model was validated including the use of site - specific relationships between selenium concentrations and loadingsBENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 253 for other nearby aquatic ecosystems (e.g. Fording, Elk and Kootenay rive rs and Lake Koocanusa). Response: Water Quantity The following section outlines the approach used to generate a high- quality, daily time -series of estimated inflows to the Oldman Reservoir, based on gauged and continuous streamflow records covering a 50-ye ar period from 1966 -2015 taken to represent the project baseline period for this particular analysis. The resulting monthly and annual flows to the reservoir are used as input to the Grassy Mountain Water and Load Balance Model, together with available se lenium concentrations to estimate loading of selenium in the inflows to and Oldman Reservoir itself. A final section outlines the potential change s in selenium loadings which may occur through the life of Grassy Mountain Mine until 2100. The Oldman Reserv oir is an on- stream water body in the Oldman River Basin, with completion of the dam and filling of the reservoir occurring in 1991 to 1992. Reser voir inflows are heavily dominated by three separate river systems, including Oldman River from the north- west (the largest sub -drainage), Crowsnest River from the west (the smallest sub -drainage), and Castle River from the south -west. All three river syst ems were gauged by Water Survey of Canada, for a two-decade period from ~1909 onwards, at gauge locations very close to (or inside) the current reservoir area, including 05AA001, 05AA002 and 05AA003 on the Oldman, Crowsnest and Castle Rivers respectively: total drainage area 3726 km 2. Gauging ceased during the 1930s and 1940s, but restarted in the 1950s at gauges located further upstream, including 05AA022, 05AA008 and 05AA023 on the Oldman, Crowsnest and Castle Rivers respectively. The first two of these continue to gauge uninterrupted through to present day, but in 2009 the Oldman River gauge was moved further downstream again (gauge 05AA035). Prior to 1965, gauging was only seasonal on the Crowsnest River at 05AA008, and during 2016-2017 gauging temporarily ceased at 05AA035, but during the 50-year period from 1966 to 2015 there were no missing data from any of the three gauges, and this length of dataset is ideal for characterizing flows under a huge range of conditions. In support of a Limnological Assessment of the Oldman Reservoir (Mitchell 2001), inflows to the reservoir were estimated for the period fro m 1983 to 1998, and an annual water balance for the reservoir was calculated from 1991 to 1998 once damming had occurred. In this analysis, the three river inflows were characterized using the upstream gauges 05AA022, 05AA008 and 05AA023 (total area 2670 km 2), which only represent ~70% of the downstream gauge area considered to be more representative of actual river inflows to the reservoir (for ins tance, the 05AA008 gauge, Crowsnest River at Frank, is ~30 km2 upstream of the earlier gauge, 05AA002, and does not include the contributions from tributaries including Gold Creek). For annual water BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 254 balance calculations, the remaining flow contributions downstream of these gauges, plus much smaller basins which contribute directly to the reservoir (e.g., Todd Cr eek, Tennesse Creek), were solved as a residual term in the water balance calculations. For the current analysis, flow data were obtained from the same gauges used as by Mitchell (2001); however, all flows across the 1966-2015 period were pro-rated higher, specifically to the former downstream gauge locations which more accurately represent actual reservoir inflows. For instance, a gauged daily flow of 1 m 3/s (Crowsnest River at Frank) becomes 1.68 m3/s at the former 05AA002 gauge close to the reservoir, when scaling by 1.68 (the ratio of drainage areas; 676 km 2 and 403 km2). This assumes the flow contribution per unit area remain constant between the upper (gauged) and lower (prediction node) locations on each river. Figure 6.26-4 presents the flow recor ds for each river and gauge introduced above. Corresponding daily statistics indicating the unit area flow contributions to each gauge are also presented. Figure 6.26-5 presents the mean monthly and annual flows from each river into the reservoir, averag ed over the 1965 to 2015 (Water Year) period hypothetically assuming the Reservoir existed across this entire period. Figure 6.26-6 present s the total annual flow contributions from each river to the reservoir. From this, the mean annual inflow sum to the reservoir (1,397 million m 3) may slightly underestimate all true reservoir inputs (e.g., including reservoir -area precipitation inputs, and remaining tributary inflows such as Todd and Tennesse creeks), but the flow estimates are considered sufficient fo r the purposes of this particular analysis. This mean value is also identical to the to the corresponding estimate (1,397 million m3) calcu lated by Mitchell (2001) for the much shorter 1991-1996 study period, despite minor differences in the approach and calculated inflow terms (i.e. , higher and more realistic estimates for the Crowsnest, Castle and Oldman Rivers in the current study, at the expense of an additional 'residual' term used by Mitchell 2001). On a mean annual basis, the relative flow contribu tions to the reservoir were calculated in the current study to be 17%, 45% and 37% for the Crowsnest, Castle and Oldman Rivers respectively. The total reservoir volume will fluctuate annually depending on natural water inputs and the managed series of water releases at the dam; for the purposes of this analysis, the average volume of 380 million m 3 calculated by Mitchell (2001) is considered s ufficient for the current analysis. This value incorporated annual water -balance estimates from 1993 to 1996 (once the reservoir had been filled), ranging from 363- 396 million m3 covering both wet and dry hydrologic years . Water Quality While AEP maintain s a provincial network of water quality sampling in major rivers and lakes/reservoirs, monitoring locations do not e xtend upstream of the Oldman Reservoir on any of the major tributaries, and selenium is not one of the publicly available parameter datasetsBENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 255 (https://www.alberta.ca/surface -water -quality- data.aspx ). Selenium concentrations were not presented in the Oldman River State of the Watershed Reports Summary (2010). The limnological assessment of the Oldman River Reservoir tabulated a summary of the initial selenium data collected at the reservoir and from the inflows; this data is summarized in Table 6.26- 2. All samples fell below water quality guidelines for the protection of freshwater aquatic life (Alberta Environment 1999). Table 6.26-2 1994 Total Selenium Data (in \u00b5g/L , presented in Mitchell 2001) Location Mean Value Range Guideline Value % Compliance Years Sampled Number of Samples Oldman Reservoir <0.2 <0.2-0.2 11 <0.2-0.4 11 100% 1994 18 Note: 1- CEQG guideline for the protection of aquatic life Other, historic data were collected along the length of Crowsnest River from 1974 to 2008, from the headwaters area (above Coleman) to just upstream of the reservoir near Lundbreck. Table 6.26- 3 summarizes this data by season. During 2013 to 2014, in support of the baseline monitoring as part of the Grassy Mountain Project, additional samples were collected on the Crownsest River just upstream and downstream of Blairmore Creek (CRR -W01 and CRR-W02, respectively), and these data are also summarized in Table 6.26-3. In both historic periods, the highest total selenium values marginally exceeded the CEQG water quality guideline of 1 mg/L in samples obtained from April to August, and also during fall (September to October) in the 2013 to 2014 sampling progra m. Dissolved selenium also exceeded the guideline duri ng 2013 to 2014, but data from 1974 to 2008 were very sparse. Note that in BC and as adopted in Alberta, a higher freshwater guideline of 0.002 mg/L is used, and only one dissolved selenium sample exceeded this value. In watercourses downstream of the Te ck mines in BC, measured selenium concentrations at the Upper River reached 113g/L (0.113 mg/L ) (Antweiler 2019).

Different number of total and dissolved selenium results were obtained, resulting in the potential for higher dissolved values than total dissolved values depending on when samples of each were obtained. The Pro ject's Water and Load Balance model was used to estimate future monthly loading s to Blairmore Creek and Gold Creek. The load estimates were derived from the model scenario that was presented in the Environmental Impact Assessment ( Appendix 10B, CIAR#42). Estimates of concentrations in the Crowsnest River were calculated by adding the flow and load from Blairmore Creek and Gold Creek to the 50- year synthetic flow series developed for the Crowsnest River. Seasonal background total selenium concentrations (spring, summer, fall and winter) in the Crowsnest River were assumed to be the median of measured concentrations BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 257 between May 2013 and January 2015. The concentration estimates assume that flow from Blairmore Creek, Gold Creek and the Crowsnest River are f ully mixed. The combined loadings from the Project site and background loadings were assumed to flow to the Oldman Reservoir and mix completely with the full volume in the reservoir. Inflows and outflows from the reservoir where estimated based on the synthetic hydrograph developed for a 50-year period the Oldman Reservoir catch ment. The assumed volume of the reservoir (380 Mm3) and background total selenium concentration were adopted from Mitchell (2001). Again, monthly concentrations were calculated using a simple mass balance approach whereinfluent selenium loads were fully mixed with the reservoir volume. Loadings in the discharge from the reservoir was calculated as the concentration calculated in the previous monthlytimestep multiplied by the flow out of the reservoir (which was assumed to be equal to the flow into the reservoir) (Figure 6.26-7). c)Using the loading information and predicted selenium concentrations in water in the Oldman Reservoir over the life of mine and into the post closure period calculated in b), provide an assessment of bioaccumulation in algae, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates and fish, (including Westslope Cutthroat Trout). Provide evidence of the validity of the predicted bioaccumulation of selenium by comparing results with information from other relevant aquatic ecosystems, including the Fording and Elk Rivers as well as Lake Koocanusa. Response: The response to JRP IR-6.28 provides an update to the wildlife risk assessment, which included direct and indirect exposure from air and surface water (as pathways) from chemicals of potential conce rn (COPCs) to the downstream receiving aquatic environments associated with Blairmore Creek, Gold Creek, and the Oldman Reservoir. The assessment included the contribution from air deposition being added to provided surface water concentrations, and these concentrations which were then applied to multi-media exposure modelling. Indirect e xposure was predicted through the multimedia exposure model for non-volatile, persistent and bioaccumulative COPCs. Modelling formulas for COPC transport and bioaccumulation were based on US EPA (2005) guidance on human health risk assessment. Selenium is unlike other COPC that bioconcentrate, as enrichment and the most consequential step in trophic transfer happens at the base of the food web. A worked example for selenium is presented in JRP IR -6.28. Selenium enrichment and transfer through the trophic food web considers available guidance from the province of British Columbia (2014) and published trophic transfer factors from the US EPA (2016) that evaluates lotic or lentic habitats separately. These guidance documents recognise selenium enrich ment and subsequent incorporation into the aquatic food web, as well as the variability between and within species as important considerations and a suite of different BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 258 guidelines for different media have been developed. However, water -only exposure studie s were considered in the derivation of the whole-body guideline for BC and the US EPA recommends a water column concentration in their translation to fish tissue estimation. B ased on this, modelled surface water concentrations were used to estimate fish tissue concentrations for the various habitats. Results of the wildlife risk assessment presented in JRP IR-6.28 indicate that the conservative application of the 95 th percentile selenium concentration (as indicated in JRP IR -6.26b) to the Oldman Reservoir is predicted to be 0.41 \u00b5g/L, does not pose a bioaccumulation risk to algae, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates or fish. The results of the updated human health assessment (JRP IR-6.27) also indicate that Project contributions to Blairmore Creek, Gold Cre ek and the Oldman Reservoir were not considered to be indicative of adverse human health effects. The predicted 95 th percentile concentration of 0.4 \u00b5g/L is less than all water quality guidelines and criteria for selenium in Canada and the United States. The Alberta water quality guideline for selenium is 2 \u00b5g/L with an alert concentration of 1 \u00b5g/L (Alberta Government 2018). As noted in the guidelines, \"Exceedance of the alert concentration in sensitive environments indicates the need for increased monit oring of water and other ecosystem compartments to support early detection of potential Se bioaccumulation issues and provide earlier opportunities to commence proactive manage ment actions.\" The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ambient water quality criterion for lentic waters, such as a reservoir, is 1.3 \u00b5g/L (USEPA 2016). Both the Alberta guideline and USEPA criterion are based on protection of fish based on bioaccumulation of selenium in the food web. The predicted 95 th percentile selenium concent ration for Oldman Reservoir is below protective guidelines and criteria, including Alberta's alert concentration of 1 \u00b5g/L, which indicates that selenium is not of concern for bioaccumulation and toxicity in fish in the Oldman Reservoir. d)Characterize any residual effects of the bioaccumulation of selenium in the Oldman Reservoir on Westslope Cutthroat Trout and other large and small -bodied fish species which are known to be present in the reservoir and present a conclusion regarding the significance of any residual effect, with emphasis on predicted selenium concentrations in egg/ovary tissue. Discuss how the residual effects may vary over the course of the life of the mine and the post closure period. Response: As noted in the response to JRP IR-6.26 (c), the predicted 95th percentile selenium concentration of 0.4 \u00b5g/L in Oldman Reservoir is below existing selenium guidelines and criteria, including an alert concentration of 1 \u00b5g/L. To provide further context ar ound the predicted water selenium concentration in Oldman Reservoir, surface water selenium concentrations at the mouth of the Elk River in British Columbia and in its receiving waterKoocanusa Reservoirare BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 259 summarized and discussed below. Selenium concentrations in fish species within Koocanusa Reservoir, including westslope cutthroat trout, are also discussed. The Elk River drains the Elk Valley watershed, which includes several active coal mines. Selenium concentrations at the primary monitoring statio n (LK2) in Koocanusa Reservoir, downstream of the Elk River, averaged 1.1 \u00b5g/L from 2014 to 2018 with a range of 0.12 to 3.4 \u00b5g/L ( Figure 6.26-8 ). The 95th percentile was 2.1 \u00b5g/L, which is about five- fold greater than the predicted 95th percentile of 0.4 \u00b5g/L for Oldman Reservoir. Selenium concentrations in Koocanusa Reservoir have been monitored in 12 fish species over the last several years, including westslope cutthroat trout. These data are discussed below. Fish tissue selenium data for Koocanusa R eservoir were compiled from Lotic Environmental (2019). For purposes of the present evaluation, data were compiled from three routinely monitored locations: (1) near the mouth of the Elk River; (2) near Sand Creek upstream of the Elk River; and (3) near G old Creek (a tributary to Lake Koocanusa; herein referred to as Gold Creek -B.C.) downstream of the Elk River. Means and standard deviations of the selenium concentrations were calculated by species and location. The data were plotted relative to Alberta's fish tissue -based selenium guidelines, which are 4 mg/kg dw for muscle and 11 mg/kg dw for eggs/ovaries (Alberta Government 2018). For fish samples collected near the Elk River mouth, mean muscle selenium concentrations exceed the guideline of 4 mg/kg dw for largescale sucker, westslope cutthroat trout, yellow perch, mountain whitefish ( Figure 6.26-9). However, mean ovary selenium concentrations for largescale sucker and yellow perch are well below the egg/ovary selenium guideline of 11 mg/kg dw ( Figure 6.26-9). In general, precedence is given to egg/ovary selenium concentrations as it is these concentrations that are most relevant to the endpoint of interesteffects on developing larvae from maternal transfer of selenium. There are three cyprinid species that have mean muscle selenium concentrations <4 mg/kg dw that have egg/ovary selenium bioaccumulation of selenium in ovaries of these cyprinids relative to muscle is interesting and unusual compared to other fish in the reservoir, but there is field and lab evidence that cyprinids are less sensitive to selenium than other fish such as trout and centrarchids (U SEPA 2016). As such, the cyprinids should not be considered as general representatives of fish in other families. Concentration patterns similar to the fish collected near the Elk River mouth are observed in fish collected from Koocanusa Reservoir upstream of the Elk River ( Figure 6.26-10) and from Koocanusa Reservoir at Gold Creek -B.C. downstream of the Elk River ( Figure 6.26- 11); however, at these two locations, the only species with a mean muscle selenium concentration exceeding the Alberta muscle guideline of 4 mg/kg dw was mountain whitefish at Sand Creek. In addition, the only species with a mean ovary selenium concentration at these two locations that exceed the Alberta egg/ovary guideline of 11 mg/kg dw is redside shiner, while mean ovary BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 260 selenium co ncentrations for peamouth chub and northern pikeminnow approach the guideline at Sand Creek and peamouth chub and rainbow trout at Gold C reek- B.C. (Figure 6.26- 8 and Figure 6.26-9 , respectively). The uniqueness of these cyprinids was previously discussed. Focusing on westslope cutthroat trout, ova ry selenium concentrations are not available for this speci es in Koocanusa Reservoir, but mean ( \u00b1SD) sel enium co ncentration in m uscle are 4.4 (\u00b13.2) m g/kg dw for samples collected near the Elk River , 3.1 (\u00b11.5) mg/kg dw for samples collected near Sand Creek, and 3.0 (\u00b12.1) mg/kg dw for samples collected near Gold Creek-B .C. (Figures 6.26-7 to 6.29-9). Although the mean muscle selenium concentration exceeds the guideline of 4 mg/kg dw near the E lk River, the means from the ot her two locations, including Gold Cr eek-B.C. downstream of the Elk R iver, are less than the guideline . The guideline of 4 mg/ kg dw is conser vative for westslope cutthroat trout. westslope cutthroat trout EC10 of 21.97 mg/kg dw, as derived in BCMOE (2014), and the mean egg- to-muscle selenium ratio of 1.8 for westslope cutthroat trout based on Rudolph et al. (2008), a muscle selenium EC10 of 12.2 mg/kg dw can be calculated. In summary, the predicted 95th percentile s elenium concentration of 0.4 \u00b5g/L for Oldman Reservoir is less than se lenium water qua lity gui deline s, including an al ert conc entration of 1 \u00b5g/L. Additionall y, considering the selenium data for Koocanusa Reservoir, which has mean and 95th percentile concentrat ions of 1.1 and 2.1 \u00b5 g/L, respectively, the resulting selenium concentrations in fish tissue, including westslope cutthroat trout, are not at concentrations of concern. These data for Koocanusa Reservoir provide further supporti ng evidence that fish in Oldman Reservoi r are no t at risk from the predicted 95th percenti le surface w ater selenium concentr ation. The Projec t is not predicted to have a significant residual effect on selenium loadings into the Oldman R eservoir. The character ization of this residual effect i s as follow s (following the Evaluation criteria for Water Quality as pr esented in Table A22- 5 in Addendum 4, Attachment 2, CIAR#55): Low magnitude -The selenium loading is predicted to be somewhat above typical baseline conditions, but well within the Environmental Quality Guidelines for Alberta Surface Waters. Geographic extent is regional beca use the selenium is predicted to reach the Oldman Reservoir . Duration is residual because the effect may last longer than 50 years. Frequency is continuous based on the model predictions. However, since this is a 95th percentile value, then the selenium loading should be lower 95% of the time. As such, it is possible that the frequency is periodic. Reversibility is reversible in the long term. Effects will remain after cessation of activities and extend for some time into post -closure but will diminish with time. TheBENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 261 water sampling at the historic mining does not show much, indicating that if there was ever anything, then it was reversible. Based on this characterization, t he residual effect is not significant. e)Provide a characterization of potential cumulative effects from cumulative selenium loadings to the Oldman Reservoir on Westslope Cutthroat Trout and other fish species at risk that are present in the reservoir, in consideration of the variability in potential cumulative effects over the course of the life of the mine and the post closure period. Cumulative selenium loadings are to include past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects, with particular attentio n on historic coal mining in the watershed and irrigation runoff to the reservoir. Response: The following provides a characterization of potential cumulative effects from cumulative selenium loadings to the Oldman Reservoir on Westslope Cutthroat Trout and other fish species at risk that are present in the reservoir. This cumulative effects assessment (CEA) was conducted following the process outlined in the Operational Policy Statement Assessing Cumulative Environmental Effects under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012. Step 1 - Scoping i)Identification of Valued Components and Summary of Project -Specific Residual Effects For the purposes of this characterization of cumulative effects, Westslope Cutthroat Trout (WSCT) has been selected as the va lued component. As discussed in the response to part d ), bull trout is the only other fish species at risk present in the Oldman Reservoir, and it is expected that the analysis and conclusions for WSCT will be representative for salmonid species within th e context of this assessment. The Project specific residual effects evaluated in this CEA are those from the release of effluent including selenium, as discussed in parts b) and d). The results of part d) show that the Project does not have a significant residual effect on selenium loadings into the Oldman Reservoir; however, because there is a residual effect, Benga has brought this residual effect forward into a cumulative effects analysis, with particular attention to residual effects from historic mining and irrigation runoff. ii)Determination of Spatial and Temporal Boundaries Spatial Boundaries To address the request of the Panel, f or this cumulative effects assessment on Se loading to the Oldman Reservoir, the study area is that described in the Oldman River State of the Watershed Report (2010), Chapter 2: the Mountain Sub- basins. This includes the Crowsnest River BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 262 watershed, the Castle River watershed, and a portion of the Oldman River mainstem as it leads to the Oldman Reservoir. These spatial boundar ies are different than those defined as the RS A in the Cumulative Effects Assessment completed for water quality for the Project (Addendum 8, Appendix A-1, CIAR#89) where the Crowsnest River watershed provided the limits of the regional study area. Temporal Boundaries The timeline evaluated for this c umulative effects assessment looks into the past, to include historical activities that may have contributed selenium loadings to the Oldman River and Reservoir to identify noticeable trends, and into the futur e (post -closure) when mitigative reclamation is expected to be complete and residual effects will have ceased. iii) Examining Past, Existing, and Future Physical Activities Past and Existing Activities Prior to the late 1800s, there was very little development in the area. In 1898, the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway was completed with the town of Blairmore being established as the main siding in the region. Between 1920 and 1928, a road paralleling the railway was upgraded and graveled to facili tate automobile travel. The route which is no w Highway 3 was eventually paved and rerouted to its current alignment. The Crowsnest River was modified with these developments to prevent damage to the structures due to flooding and river bed migration. In the early 1900s, coal was discovered in the region and additional towns were established along the railway to support coal mines at Coleman, Bellevue and Frank. The communities in the RSA continued to develop primarily along the route of the highway and the railroad with the primary industry in the area being coal mining. The communities had an effect on water quality in the RSA as water users and generation of waste. Historical coal mining in the region began with the establishment of the first mines in the early 1900s. Specifically, the legacy Greenhill Mine was located near Blairmore Creek, while the legacy Bear Valley Mine and Bellevue Mines were located in the vicinity of Gold Creek. All of these mines have since closed however a number of the histo rical mining areas remain in a disturbed condition including the Grassy Mountain Mine, which is situated within the project footprint and was in operation off and on from 1952 through to 1976. There is not enough evidence to demonstrate that these histori cal operations have a material effect on selenium levels in the creeks, as supported by the data below. Substantial baseline monitoring was conducted for the Project to help determine if there were existing elevated selenium concentrations in surface wate r related to historic mining: A review of the surface water and groundwater samples collected from springs, toe springs, historic mine ponds and streams located in the vicinity of the historical mine,BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 263 conducted for the hydrogeological assessment (EIA, CR#3, Section 5.4.2, CIAR#42), indicates that overall very few exceedances of Freshwater Aquatic Life (FWAL) guidelines occurred. Selenium is the only element which was frequently detected above FWAL in surface water and groundwater samples. Selenium concent rations above guidelines we re observed at surface water locations, including the Crowsnest River, streams, the Greenhill Portal (Main) and historic mine ponds. Selenium was monitored at the toe springs of the historical mine spoil (waste rock), but genera lly at concentrations below guidelines, which may be interpreted as indicative of no notable residual effect related to historical mining activities. Other, historic data were collected along the length of Crowsnest River from 1974 to2008, from the headw aters area (above Coleman) to just upstream of the reservoir near Lundbreck. Table 6.26- 3 summarizes this data by season. During 2013 to 2014, in support of the baseline monitoring as part of the Grassy Mountain Project, additionalsamples were collected on the Crownsest River jus t upstream and downstream of Blairmore Creek (CRR -W01 and CRR- W02, respectively), and these data are also summarized in Table 6.26-3. In both historic periods, the highest Total Selenium values marginally exceeded the water qual ity guideline exceedance of 1 mg/L in samples obtained from April to August, and also during fall (September to October) in the2013 to 2014 sampling program. Dissolved selenium also exceeded the guidelineduring 2013 to 2014, but data from 1974 to 2008 were very sparse. Water qu ality surveys were conducted at five stations within the Blairmore Creek drainage and eightstations within the Gold Creek drainage, and three stations in the Crowsnest River fromMay 2013 to March 2016. A new station at Caudron Creek (CC-W01) was introdu ced in 2016 as a reference site for Gold Creek and sampled during winter and spring 2016.Blairmore Creek upstream station, BC -W03 also was proposed to be a reference station for Blairmore Creek during operations. These results were summarized in Table 10 (EIA, CR#5, CIAR#42) which indicate some exceedences of water quality guidelines for selenium in Gold Creek. There is not enough evidence to demonstrate that these historical operations have a material effect on selenium levels in the creeks, as they do not appear to follow patterns or trends related to historic mining specifically. Water quality within the Oldman Reservoir is described in response to part a) i ) and part b ). With respect to historical water quality, average con centrations of total metals in the water column of the Oldman Reservoir from 1991 to 1996 are presented in Table 6.26-1 and Table 6.26-2 , along with exceedances of relevant water quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life at that time. Selenium concentrations were at or below the analytical detection limit in all samples. The general use of lands in the area is described in the report: Oldman River State of the Watershed Report (2010). According to this report (pg. 41) forest and grassland cov er the majority of this are a. Forest is the dominant land cover in this area, at 64% and is largely managed by Forest Management Unit C5. Grassland is the next largest land cover type at 23% BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 264 of the area, consisting of Foothills Fescue and Montane natural sub-regions. These grassl ands are largely used for grazing. \"Since 87% of the Mountain Sub- basins is covered by forest and grassland, erosion is not an important concern\" (pg. 45). \"Approximately 25% of the Mountain Sub-basins is altered by human development. Agricultural activit ies comprise the largest component (22%)\" (pg. 49), consisting of grazing and cultivation. Cultivated land covers 8%, of which 60% is cereal crops and 38% is forage crops. \"All irrigation projects within the Mountain Sub -basins are individual licensed private developments. There are no irrigation districts licensed to draw water from streams in the Mountain Sub-basins\" (pg. 58). Table 2.7 indicates that the amount of irrigated land (which includes grazing and cropped land) is only 1% in the area. Selenium can be of concern in irrigation run -off, as seen historically in some areas in the Western USA. These areas \"have in common an arid climate, closed drainage basins, seleniferous Cretaceous geology, and they receive irrigation drainage water from nearby agricultural areas. Similar conditions occur in SW Saskatchewan and SE Alberta.\" (Outridge et al., 1999, pg.81). Subsequently, Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development (Little et al., 2010) conducted a study of water quality in Alberta's Irrigation Districts to investigate these types of concerns. However, there are no irrigation districts within this cumulative effect assessment's spatial boundaries, which are located to the east. Both studies suggest that the potential for selenium loa ding related to irrigation is related to more eastern portions of the province where there is more extensive irrigation and higher likelihood of seleniferous geology. Within the irrigation districts water sampling, Little et al. (2010) found that \"water quality guidelines for nutrients and metals were met that majority of the time\" and found 87% compliance for selenium with protection of aquatic life guidelines (pg.vi). Urban centres include Bellevue, Hillcrest, Frank, Blairmore, Coleman, Lundbreck and Cowley, which combined cover less than 1% of the Mountain Sub- basins. Approximately 2% of the area \"supports infrastructure, primarily linear developments\" (cutlines, wellsite access roads and pipelines) (pg. 47, Oldman Watershed Council 2010). There are major transportation corridors of Highways 3 and 22 that cross the area east/west and north/south respectively. There are recreation uses within the area, such as campgrounds and trails, but less than 1% of the area is designated for that use ( pg. 49, Oldman Watershed Council 2010). As noted above, there is insufficient evidence to indicate that selenium levels in local creeks and downstream waterbodies ( e.g., Oldman Reservoir) have resulted in issues related to loading and/or bioaccumulation. Since the construction of the Oldman Reservoir/Dam in 1991, populations of key fish species have declined dramatically and habitat has been altered to a more lentic -type ( i.e., oligotrophic environment) with a relative high flushing rate and short residenc e time. Bull trout were abundant in the reservoir in 1991 (Moore et al. 1993), but severely declined five years post -completion (Lima et al. 2016). Even with the noticeable Bull Trout decline in the reservoir, a small population of adfluvial and resident Bull Trout ( population BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 265 estimate of 250 to 1,000 individuals) appear to persist in the Reservoir (ASRD 2012, Warnock in Hurkett 2009). Within five years of the Oldman River Dam Project, WSCT nearly disappeared from the reservoir area (Lima et al. 1993). Although the governments of Alberta (Alberta Westslope Cutthroat Trout Recovery Team 2013) and Canada (DFO 2014, DFO 2019) have developed a recovery plan and strategy for WSCT, Oldman Reservoir was not identified as critical habitat. With the abundance of rainbow trout in the Oldman Reservoir (Moore et al. 1993), it is likely that the very few pure strain WSCT remain, given the high occurrence of hybridization between rainbow trout and WSCT. Several other fish species are documented within the reservoir; however, ther e are no records or studies that specifically discuss their abundance and/or status. Given the Oldman Reservoir is a lentic system, species with generalist traits for reproductive requirements (i.e., tolerant to a wide range of flows, open substratum, non- migratory) increased in relative abundance following completion of the Oldman Dam (Lima at al. 2016), including White Sucker, Longnose Sucker, Longnose Dace, Brook Stickleback and Northern Pike. Although Brown Trout, Mountain Whitefish and Lake Whitefis h are present within the area (Moore et al. 1993, Campen 2016), no records of species/population abundance could be found in the public record. In summary, the Castle and Crowsnest watersheds have experienced past and existing activity since t he late 1800s, with 25% being altered by human development. The influence of historic mining on water quality is undetermined, and there is little potential for selenium loading from irrigation runoff in this area. Certain and Reasonably Foreseeable Projects and Activ ities Certain and reasonably foreseeable projects and activities were reviewed to determine which activities could interact cumulatively with past and existing activities on selenium loading within the Oldman Reservoir. Those activities and p rojects inclu de: Baldy Ridge Mine Expansion by Teck Coal Ltd. - This project was not included in this cumulative effects assessment as it is located on the western side of a mountain divide; subsequently, is not associated with the Crowsnest River watershed. The Michel Creek Coking Coal Project by North Coal Ltd. - For the same reason as the Teck Bald Ridge Mine Expansion, this project was not included in this cumulativeeffects assessment. Other potential future mining activities: There have been no other coal mine projectapplications reported to the AER that would qualify to be considered certain orreasonable foreseeable, under the CEAA 2012 definitions. No other coal mining relatedactivities have been carried forward in this cumulative effects assessment. Future timber operations on Crown Land - Land use maps indicate that the timber operations and associated activities between 1982 and 1996 characterized the Gold Creek watershed (Adden dum 1, CR#6, Appendix A2, CIAR#44) after which there has been essentially no such development in the Gold Creek watershed. In the BlairmoreBENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 266 Creek watershed, a smaller amount of timber operation or forest resource management activities occurred from 1996 to 2015. As discussed in JRP IR -5.31 (Addendum 10, CIAR#251) TSS was the factor under evaluation due to timber operations. Future timber operations are not expected to contribute to selenium loading into aquatic systems, thus future timber activities have not been carried forward in this cumulative effects assessment. Future recreation activities were considered but are not expected to contribute toselenium loading in the Oldman Reservoir. Therefore, these activities were not carried forward in this cumu lative effects assessment. Alberta Transportation (AT) re -alignment of Highway No. 3 - This project was not included as although AT have identified conceptual alignment, construction of thisproject is unlikely to occur during the operations of the proposed Grassy Mountain CoalProject, and highways are not expected to be a contributor to selenium loading in theOldman Reservoir. Therefore, this activity was not carried forward into this cumulative effects assessment. After review, it was determined that t here are no certain or reasonably foreseeable projects within the tempora l boundaries that are expected to contribute to future selenium loading in the Oldman Reservoir. Should future projects become more certain and/or develop plans to seek approvals in the future, they would likely be required to conduct cumulative effects a ssessments. Summary of Activities There are past and existing activities that have potential to contribute selenium to the watershed. The discussion of potential cumulative effects below focuses on these past and existing activities and the potential contributions from the Project. Step 2 - Analysis of Cumulative Effects The three assessment cases considered for evaluating potential cumulative effects on WSCT from selenium loading include: Baseline Case: includes an assessment of the current environmental conditions that considers past and existing activities; Application Case: includes the findings and trends of the Baseline Case and incorporates the effects of the proposed Projec t activities; and Planned Development Case: includes the identification of certain and/or reasonably foreseeable projects or activities that could act in combination with the past, existing,and Project activities. Past and Existing Considerations Water quality data was reviewed for 2 scenarios: conditions in the Oldman Reservoir and baseline conditions at the Project site. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 267 Baseline conditions for the Oldman Reservoir are described above in parts a) and b) . Data on Se concentrations in the Oldman Reservoir do not suggest a current loading of Se. Baseline surface water quality data from the Project suggest that concentrations of detectable metals were generally within Alberta water quality guidelines, with the exception of total selenium which occasionally exceeded water quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life. Total selenium only exceeded the guidelines at Gold Creek. Guideline exceedances for selenium were noted in the Crowsnest River baseli ne data (EIA, Section E.5.2.2, CIAR#42). Water monitoring for the hydrogeological assessment of historic rock dumps and toe springs, and showed some exceedances of selenium for the FWAL guidelines, however it is difficult to determine cause and effect spe cifically related to historic mining. Selenium loading from irrigation is not likely a contributor in this area because only 1% of land is irrigated and conditions are not likely to lead to selenium release from irrigation runoff. Little et al. (2010) suggested 87% compliance with guidelines for selenium, even in more eastern irrigation districts (Little et al. 2010). Project Considerations The cumulative effects analysis looks at the Project in combination with past, existing and future activities. The Project's contribution to selenium loading in the Oldman Reservoir was discussed in part c. Regarding cumulative selenium loading potential in the Oldman Reservoir, the 95 th percentile selenium concentration in the reservoir is predicted to be 0.41 \u00b5g/L, which is below the Alberta Water Quality guide line of 2 \u00b5g/L and the alert concentration of 1 \u00b5g/L (Alberta Government 2018). The guideline was developed to be protective against the bio- accumulative effects of selenium in aquatic food webs and particularly sensitive fish. This loading prediction is the 95th percentile concentration meaning that 95% of the time, selenium loading is predicted to be below this value. As well, this loading is assumed to be continuous over the life of the mine, which is also conservative; therefore, the predicted loadin g of 0.41 \u00b5g/L is considered conservative. Future Considerations There are no certain and/or reasonably foreseeable projects within the temporal boundaries for this assessment as discussed above. In conclusion, as there are no other calculated loadings from future projects, and no other quantitatively defined sources of current Se loading, the cumulative selenium loading is just that from the Project. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 268 Step 3 - Mitigation Potential impacts to surface water quality have been mitigated on a Project level as part of the Project's Water Management Plan, which includes mitigation for selenium (EIA, Section C.5, CIAR#42). As the Project's contribution to selenium related cumulative effects in the Oldman Reservoir are low magnitude, no further mitigation is propos ed beyond the mitigation measures planned to manage selenium at the Project level. Step 4 - Significance There may be a residual cumulative effect on selenium loading into the Oldman Reservoir. The characterization of this residual effect is as follows (following the Evaluation criteria for Water Quality as presented in Table A22 -5 in Addendum 4, Attachment 2, CIAR #55): Low magnitude -The selenium loading is predicted to be somewhat above typical baseline conditions, but well within the Environmental Quality Guidelines for AlbertaSurface Waters. Geographic extent is regional because the selenium is predicted to reach the OldmanReservoir . Duration is residual because the effect may last longer than 50 years. Frequency is continuous based on the model predictions. However, since this is a 95 th percentile value, then the selenium loading should be lower 95% of the time. As such, it is possible that the frequency is periodic. Reversibility is reversible in the long term. Effects will remain after cessat ion of activities and extend for some time into post -closure, but will diminish with time. The water sampling at the historic mining does not show much, indicating that if there wasever anything, the n it was reversible. Based on this characterization, the residual effect is not significant. Step 5 - Follow- Up A Project level follow -up monitoring plan has been developed: Aquatic Monitoring Plan (Appendix 6.23-1). As the Project's contribution to selenium related cumulative effects in the Oldman Reservoir are low, no further mitigation is proposed beyond the mitigation measures planned to manage selenium at the Project level. Adaptive management is a key part of the Aquatic Monitoring Plan, and as such, the monitoring program for selenium will be modified as necessary based on monitoring results observed over time.

(CIAR #251). Comments from the Government of Canada Health Canada submission. (CIAR #283). The Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) conducted by Benga is incomplete, as it does not consider water -based exposure pathways in the LSA, RSA, the Oldman Reservoir or the end pit lake in the post- closure landscape. Water -based pathways may contribute to the risk to human health via drinking water, but most notably, via bioaccumulation of contaminants in aquatic food webs. Bioaccumulation in fish consumed by people, as well as in other aquatic food web components used for traditional purposes such as aquatic plants would be relevant pathways. The EIS Guidelines (CEAR #11) specify that the proponent will provide, \"with respect to Aboriginal peoples, a description and analysis of how changes to the environment caused by the Project will affect: human health, considering, but not limited to, potential changes in air quality, quality and availabi lity of country foods, water quality (drinking and recreational), and noise exposure. When risks to human health due to changes in one or more of these components are predicted, a complete HHRA examining all exposure pathways for pollutants of concern may be necessary to adequately characterise potential risks to human health\". Benga states in Section 5.1.3, Appendix 5 (CIAR #251) that, \"The Project is not expected to have any direct effect on water quality or aquatic health\". This statement is made despite the fact that water quality modeling conducted by Benga predicts increases in selenium, nitrate, sulphate, zinc and cobalt concentrations in Blairmore Creek and Gold Creek as well as in other mine facilities such as sedimentation ponds and the end pit lak e planned for the post-closure period. The predicted concentrations will peak during mine operations and then remain close to peak concentrations over the entire post -closure period modeled (to year 2100) (Appendix 10b, CIAR #42). Also, this statement does not address groundwater-based pathways via alluvial as well as bedrock aquifers as requested in IR 4.15 (CIAR #212). In the response to IR 4.15 (CIAR #251) repeated the assertion that there will be no direct effects on water quality, despite the potentia lly close connections between surface water and alluvial aquifers. The basis for screening -out water -based pathways in the HHRA is not sufficient. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 272 Tsuut'ina Nation notes (CIAR #220) that the HHRA address es contaminants of potential concern (COPCs) from aerial deposition but does not consider the potential uptake and bioaccumulation of contaminants from contact water. The HHRA should include water -based exposure in the Oldman Reservoir because the transport of contaminants of concern to lentic environments c an result in a greater degree of bioaccumulation in aquatic food chains. Furthermore, the potential human health risks associated with the end pit lake in the postclosure landscape requires assessment, as noted by Health Canada (CIAR #283). Revise and resubmit the relevant sections of the HHRA to include the following: a)An assessment of water -based exposure pathways (both groundwater and surface water) in the LSA (including the end pit lake), RSA and the Oldman Reservoir using predicted concentrations of contaminants of concern in the LSA and RSA from Appendix 10b (CIAR #42) as well as predicted concentrations in the Oldman Reservoir (see IR 6.26). The assessment is to include: an Indigenous specific conceptual model (e.g. a diagram as to how Indigenous peoples may be exposed to contaminants of concern) which describes sourcepathway linkages between the Project and Indigenous use of all aquatic pathways including the end pit lake, Blairmore and Gold Creeks, the Crowsnest River and the Oldman Reservoir in the post closure landscape; and, Response: At the request of the JRP, the Project's Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) was updated as part of the Tenth Addendum to the Environm ental Impact Assessment; response IR-4.9, Appendix 4.9- 1, CIAR #251). In response to this current information request, an assessment of water -based exposure pathways (both groundwater and surface water) in the LSA (including the end pit lake), Crowsnest River, and the Oldman Reservoir using predicted concentrations of contaminants of concern in the LSA and RSA, and predicted concentrations in the Oldman Reservoir is presented as Addendum 1 to the HHRA ( Appendix 6.27-1). The assessment includes an Indigenous-specific conceptual model, which describes sourcepathway linkages between the Project and Indigenous use of all aquatic pathways including the end pit lake, Blairmore and Gold Creeks, the Crowsnest River and the Oldman Reservoir in the post closure landscape. It is important to note that the conclusions of the Addendum 1 to the HHRA do not differ from those pres ented revised risk characteri zation that goes beyond a contaminantbycontaminant table of Health Quotients (HQs) and produces a sum of all HQs which addresses theBENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 273 cumulative exposure to all COPCs from all pathways, including water- based pathways. Response: A revised risk characterization that addresses the cumulative exposure to all COPCs from all pathways, including water-based pathways is also Addendum 1 to the HHRA (Appendix 6.27-1).

Tenth Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment - Appendix H to Appendix 4.9.1, Wildlife Screening Risk Assessment. (CIAR #251). Benga stated, in the wildlife screening risk assessment, \"Since none of the identified COPCs are expected to biomagnify up the food chain and in most cases they are metabolized in higher organisms; exposures are expected to be highest for primary consumers (CCME, 2010; US EPA, 1999)\" (CIAR #251). This statement that \"most COPC\" are metabolized is not supported by Benga with references to literature. In section 2.3 of its wildlife screening risk assessment (CIAR #251), Benga also states \"Project COPC will be emitted to air and direct inhalation of air is expected to be the primary exposure pathway. Maximum predicted air concentrations were used for assessing acute and chronic inhalation exposures for wildlife\". Benga indicates in Table H.3 titled Exposure Pathways, that ingestion of fish and ingestion of prey were screened -out because no impacts on surface w ater are predicted in Consultant Report #6, Aquatic Assessment (CIAR #42), and comparison of predicted deposition of COPC onto surface water indicate estimated surface water concentrations are below guidelines protective of FAL Freshwater Aquatic Life (FAL ). Benga further notes that for COPC that do biomagnify up the food chain, this pathway is considered as part of the soil quality guideline.The screening -out of water-based exposure pathways is not commensurate with the understanding of the importance of bioaccumulation in aquatic food chains (notably for selenium). Water -based pathways cannot be screened -out for wildlife which consume aquatic-based food. Furthermore, risks associated with exposure to COPCs do not result solely from biomagnification, but also from bioaccumulation via uptake from water or sediment to aquatic plants and algae which are then consumed by invertebrates. Aquatic- dependent wildlife such as waterfowl, piscivorous and aquatic- based insectivorous birds (such as Great Blue Heron and American Dipper), or mammals such as bats (which consume invertebrates which emerge as adults from waterbodies) are then exposed to COPC through consumption of these water -based preys. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project JRP Information Request, Package 6 March 2020 Page 275 Comments from Environment and Climate Change Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada and members of the public raised concerns regarding wildlife exposure to project- related COPCs from both terrestrial and aquatic environments #242). Benga predicts increases in and cobalt concentrati ons in Blairmore Creek and Gold Creek as well as in other mine facilities such as sedimentation ponds and the end pit lake planned for the post-closure period. The predicted concentrations will peak during mine operations and then remain close to peak conc entrations over the entire post-closure period modeled (to year 2100) (Appendix 10b, CIAR #42). Therefore, there is potential for exposure of wildlife to elevated concentrations of these COPCs during mine operations as well as during the post- closure perio d in the LSA and RSA as a result of consumption of drinking water and aquatic- based food pathways. Given this, the wildlife screening risk assessment should also include exposure via consumption of water and aquatic -based food in the Oldman Reservoir as a result of the potential transport of contaminants of concern to this lentic environment. a) Screen all wildlife health COPC via water -based pathways for the tendency to bioaccumulate in lotic and lentic aquatic systems including Blairmore Creek, Gold Creek , mine facilities such as sedimentation ponds, the planned end pit lake for the post-closure period, and the Oldman Reservoir. Selenium must be included as a COPC. Include explicit consideration of selenium loadings to the Oldman Reservoir and subsequent uptake into aquatic organisms in the Oldman Reservoir. Provide a rationale for any screening -out of other COPC; b) Include receptors which have diets comprised in whole or in part of aquatic-based prey. These receptors should include all bat species listed as receptors in Table H.6 of Appendix H to Appendix 4.91, as well as representative and sensitive migratory waterfowl, shorebirds, and piscivorous birds such as Great Blue Heron. American dipper should be included as a receptor for Blairmore Creek; c)Include ingestion of fish and inges tion of prey which are water- based (such as aquatic invertebrates) in the calculation of hazard quotients for COPC which accumulate in aquatic food chains, including, but not necessarily limited to, selenium; d) Provide the Health Quotients (HQs) for all receptors referenced in b) with an accompanying risk characterization narrative (including an uncertainty analysis); and e)Provide a multi -media exposure risk characterization for all receptors reference in b); i.e., risk from all exposure pathways listed in Table H.3 of Appendix H to Appendix 4.9.1.

Grassy Mountain underwent extensive historic underground and surface stripping mining operations by West Canadian Collieries Ltd. from 1905 to 1968 (Alberta 1981; ERCB 1988). A pre-field overview study identified 32 previously documented historical resources sites (archaeology and heritage structures) inside or within 100-metres of the Project's footprint. Twenty-five (n=25) High Potential Areas were developed as a means to focus the field survey on certain terrain that had the potential to contained undiscovered archaeological sites based on relationship to water, distinguishing landforms, proximity to known archaeological sites, and landforms that are typically conducive to having such sites. The field survey was conducted from June to October 2015, and resulted in the documentation o f 40 historical resource sites, 24 of which were revisits of previously known sites, and 16 were newly identified sites. Additionally, other areas encountered, besides the High Potential Areas, that were deemed to have potential for historical resources were shovel tested, resulting in the 61 Assessment Areas. A minimum of 210 areas were visually examined resulting in 21 spots that were positive for artifacts, and the excavations of 1,110 subsurface tests, 151 of which contained artifacts. A total of 3,9 75 artifacts were recovered. Table 73 summarizes the 20 historical resource sites with no Historical Resources Act concerns or Historical Resources Act clearance is recommended. Table 7 4 summarizes the 17 historical resource sites recommended for further historical resources work or Historical Resource Act clearance with conditions for the proposed the Benga Mining Limited (Riversdale Resources) Grassy Mountain Coal Project in the Municipality of Crowsnest Pass. All recommendations are subject to approval from Alberta Culture and Tourism. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ HRIA 2015 -074 471 No. Borden/ Historic 11U UTM LSD/ATS Mining Impact Area Revisited/ NEW Environment Exp.

In regards to Structure 12, the fire equipment storage and garage and the footprint of the Rail and Load -out, the Project plans were received on May 21, 2015 from Riversdale Resources, and the HRIA was planned and conducted accordi ngly to the given footprint. Based on the results of the HRIA fieldwork, Structure 12, the foundation remains of the fire equipment storage and garage is within the footprint of the Rail and Load -out configuration. A more defined and detailed plan of the Rail and Load -out was received on August 8, 2015 from Riversdale Resources showing impact avoidance to all of the structures and remains of the Greenhill Mine Complex including Structure 12 (HS 32395), the foundation remains of the fire equipment storage and garage. Based on the more defined plans, Structure 13, the foundation remains of the fire equipment storage and garage will be avoided from impact. The proposed Rail and Load -out will impact a portion of site DjPo -38, the Greenhill Mine, a historical resource site with an Hi storical Resource Value of 1, 2h (historic), and 3a (archaeology), and thus further historical resource work is recommended. On January 11, 2016, the Permit Holder consulted with Fraser Shaw, Heritage Conservation Advisor, Southern Region, Alberta Culture and Tourism regarding the additional HRIA recommendations for site DjPo- 38, the Greenhill Mine, and they include: 1. Increase stability or any other mitigation measures to the fragile state of the compressor house, the wash house, and the office and lamp house. 2. Any engineered mitigation measures of the Rail and Load -out configuration that may reduce or minimize any ancillary and accumulative impacts that may exacerbate the fragileness of the compressor house, the wash house, and the office and lamp house, such as vibrations and noise from its construction and operations. 3. A detailed architectural documentation of the foundation remains of the compressor house, the wash house, and the office and lamp house and garage, and the salvaging of all associated artifac ts.

A grand total of 2,036 artifacts were recovered between 0 - 50 cm in depth from primary context including the four (n=4) projectile points representing three pre - contact cultural components, as well as the historic period. A total of 1,968 pre-contact artifacts were recovered primary context including 5 projectile points representing three pre -contact cultural components, Early Pre -contact 9,600 - 8,600 B.P., Middle Pre -contact 2,500 - 1,350 B.P., and Late Pre - contact 1,350 - 250 B.P. Additionally, a buried pre -contact hearth was identified, the faunal remains of bison and moose, and the variety of stone tools identified ; these findings suggest that a variety of activities occurred at the site. The site is considered to be of high arc haeological significance . A Stage 1 mitigative excavation of 120 m 2 is recommended with the removal of levels at 5 cm intervals down to 40 - 50 cm below surface. It is anticipated that the 120 m2 will be divided among the three terraces as a means to det ermine how each of the terraces were occupied. The 120 m2 excavation will represent a sampling strategy of 0.2% of the total site area (280 m2 x 195 m2 = 54,600 m2). Additionally, radiocarbon dating is recommended to correlate the three pre -contact cultural components that were deduced from the seriation of the four 685237E 5503726N 4-24-8-4- 5; 1,2-23-8-4-5 Coal Handling Processing Plant complex . 1 1 N/A Site DjPo -101 is within the footprint of the Coal Handling Processing Plant, and will be directly impacted. It was assessed that the integrity of Structure 4 (HS 18796) was most likely weakened after it was buried, and the two wooden A frames (HS 106672 and 106674) have low to limited historical resource value therefore , there are no historical resource concern regarding those three structures. On December 7, 2015, the Permit Holder questioned David R. Leslie, P. Eng., VP of Technical Services for Riversdale Resources regarding their plans for the Generator House, the Fan House, and the Mine Entrance. Riversdale Resources plan to avoid those structures in their project design for the Coal Handling Processing Plant, however those plans will not be definite until later in 2016. At this point, Historical Resources Act clearance is recommended for site DjPo -101, the Boisjoli Mine, as long as the Generator House (HS 106670) , the Fan House (HS 106671), and the Mine Entrance (HS 22702) are shown to be avoided in the final construction plans, as well as fencing or monitoring measures to ensure avoidance during construction. If avoidance is not feasible, th en further historical resources work is warranted. 6 DjPo -116; HS concrete foundation Pre-contact & historic 685965E 5504165N 5,6-11-24-8- 4-5 South Disposal Area Revisited Disturbed landscape along Grassy Mountain Road.

Eng., VP of Technical Services for Riversdale Resources to explain the Project plans for the cable run foundation . Riversdale Resources plan s to avoid the foundation in their final project design for the Overland Conveyor; it will be above ground, however those plans will not be definite until later in 2016. At this point, Historical Resources Act clearance is recommended for Hoist #6, as long as the cable run foundation (HS 106646) are shown to be avoided in their final construc tion plans, as well as fencing measures to ensure avoidance from during construction. If avoidance is not feasible, th en further historical resources work is warranted.

A literature search found nothing of particular historical significance regarding the property, the structures or the landowners, therefore, the site has limited historical resource significance, and documentation of the structures provided in this final report is considered satisfactory. The structures are considered to have a low to limited historical resource value, and thus, Historical Resources Act clearance is reco mmended for HS 106699, 106700, 106701, 106702, and 106703 Regarding the engine from the hoist house (HS 106703) ; despite not finding any details regarding the manufacture history of the engine, the Permit Holder believe s that such a material item may hav e artifactual significance to the coal mining history of the Crowsnest Pass. After consultation with Trevor Peck, Archaeologist for the Alberta Survey of Alberta Culture and Tourism on January 12, 2016, it was decided that Alberta Culture and Tourism will make inquiries to the Reynolds -Alberta Museum in Wetaskiwin on whether the engine has any historical significance to the history of Alberta, and whether such an item should be curated. 54 (21+) 351 (133+) 3,916 Table 74: Historical resource sites recommended for further historical resources work, con't.

Available at: http://bceia.com/wp - SEEPAGE WATER USING BIOCHEMICAL REACTOR TECHNOLOGY1 Tom Rutkowski2, Russ Walker, Jim Gusek, Mike Baker Abstract. Water quality in the lower Colorado and Gunnison Rivers in western Colorado, and many of their tributaries, is impaired by selenium, which originates from the local Mancos shale. Because of the diffuse and widespread nature of this source, there are limited opportunities to reduce selenium inputs. One option is to treat selenium-contaminated surface water at strategic locations, such as point-source discharges. Gravel extraction is common along these rivers, and treatment of discharges from pit dewatering presents an opportunity for reducing selenium loading. The pilot test goals were: 1) demonstrate that a passive BCR can accomplish high-efficiency selenium removal at the pilot scale 2) determine the relationship between selenium removal efficiency and detention time 3) assesses the influence of seasonal temperature fluctuations on treatment performance 4) determine design parameters for a full-scale system ( i.e., one with a footprint on the scale of up to a few acres). A single 4,380 cubic foot pilot BCR was constructed to treat flows ranging from 2 to 24 gallons per minute. The vertical-flow reactor media contains cow manure, hay, sawdust, wood chips, and limestone. Influent was drawn from a dewatering trench in a gravel pit next to the Colorado River near Grand Junction, Colorado. The pilot operated, with varying detention times, over a thirt een-month period from September 2008 until October 2009. The pilot achieved maximum selenium removal rates of 98% with a hydraulic retention time of 2.4 days and a minimum effluent concentration of 0.0005 mg/L (0.5 \u00b5g/L). The highest mass removal rate achieved by the BCR was 73 mg/day/m3 and the cumulative mass of total selenium removal was 600 grams. The BCR treatment process was effective throughout the cold winter months during which total selenium removal rates remained greater than 90%. The total capital cost for the pilot BCR was $39,200 or $0.50 per 1,000 gallons treated. The operations and maintenance costs for a passive BCR system are minimal. Based on the successful operation of the pilot, including high rates of selenium removal and consistent year-round operation, the BCR technology appears to be an effective, low-cost selenium treatment option. This project was funded by the US Bureau of Reclamation Science and Technology Program, Project #4414.

Proceedings America Society of Mining and Reclamation, 2010 pp 9 14-939 DOI: 10.21000/JASMR100109 14 915 Introduction Selenium in surface and groundwater has generated concern since 1982, when selenium was found responsible for mortality of fish and birds inhabiting the Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge in California (National Research Council, 1989). The western United States is susceptible to Se contamination of ground and surface water due to a combination of geology, climate, and irrigated agriculture. Over 777,000 km2 (17%) of the total land area in the western U.S. is composed of seleniferous bedrock, much of which is irrigated (Seiler et al, 2003). Selenium is mobilized as irrigation drainage waters leach it from the bedrock and soils. The arid and semi-arid climates promote high rates of evaporation, which can lead to elevated concentrations of Se in surface waters, causing some areas to exceed water quality standards. Although Se forms the active center of certain enzymes and is thus an essential nutrient, at elevated concentrations it is toxic to invertebrates, fish, birds, and mammals. The oxidation state of Se determines its bioavailability and toxicity (Amweg et al, 2003). Selenium can occur in its elemental form (Se0), as Se is insoluble and has little effect on living organisms. The inorganic forms, selenate and selenite, are both soluble and bioavailable, with selenite being the more toxic of the two. Organic selenide is the most bioavailable form of Se, and is utilized by algae 1,000 times more easily than the inorganic forms. Selenium is also bioaccumulative; its concentration may increase in organisms at successively higher levels in the food chain. The Grand Valley in western Colorado is underlain by the highly seleniferous Mancos shale. Selenium in surface waters here has been measured at concentrations exceeding 100 g/L (Spahr et al, 2000), which is well above the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's criterion of 5.0 g/L as a maximum continuous concentration of total Se for protection of freshwater aquatic life (EPA). Because of the diffuse and widespread occurrence of the Mancos shale, there are limited opportunities to reduce Se inputs to surface waters. One option is to treat selenium-contaminated water at strategic locations, such as point-source discharges (Bureau of Reclamation, 2006). Gravel extraction is common along the Colorado River, and treatment of discharges created by dewatering of groundwater into the pits presents an opportunity for reducing selenium loading to the river. 916 Selenium-contaminated water can be treated by physical, chemical, and biological treatment methods (Frankenberger et al. 2004 ). Recently, biological treatment has emerged as a leading technology for Se treatment (Microbial Technologies 2005). Biological treatment of Se is accomplished through microbial reduction of oxidized Se species such as selenate and selenite to insoluble elemental Se. In the generalized reactions below, Se serves as an electron acceptor and organic carbon (e.g., BCR substrate, molasses) serves as an electron donor (Fujita et al. 2002). Common electron acceptors that must be removed prior to Se include dissolved oxygen and nitrate. Biological treatment offers a low cost alternative to more expensive physical and chemical treatment methods and is effective in cold climates (Microbial Technologies 2005). Additionally, it has the proven ability to meet regulatory selenium limits (MSE 2001, Sonstegar 2008 ). Passive biological treatment systems have been tested extensively at the bench and pilot scale, but have yet to be implemented at full-scale. Golder Associates Inc. (Golder) and Mesa State College (Mesa State) received U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Science and Technology funding in 2006 to conduct a bench-scale study on biochemical reactor (BCR) treatment of Se. The bench BCR test cells consistently reduced selenium concentrations in the influent water to values below the EPA maximum continuous concentration for protection of aquatic life (Pahler et al. 2007, Mesa State College and Golder 2007 ). Based on the successful bench results, additional funding was secured to conduct a pilot with the following goals: 1. demonstrate that a passive BCR can accomplish high-efficiency Se removal at the pilot scale 2. determine the relationship between Se removal efficiency and detention time 3. assesses the influence of seasonal temperature fluctuations on treatment performance 917 4. determine design parameters for a full-scale system ( i.e., one with a footprint on th e scale of up to a few acres). Materials and Methods Site Description The study was conducted in a gravel pit operation in Grand Junction, Colorado. Groundwater seeps into a dewatering trench along three sides of the gravel pit perimeter and is pumped from this trench into an adjacent agricultural drain, which flows into the Colorado River approximately 45 m (50 yd) away. Selenium concentrations in the groundwater seepage that is discharged to the agricultural drain range from approximately 30 g/L to 90 g/L (Kerr 2006). Materials and Design The BCR consisted of an above-ground cell contained within an earthen berm (photo 1). The berm s lope was 3 H:1V from grade to an elevation of 6 ft above grade on both the inside and outside of the structure, with a three-foot wide level crest. The at-grade \"floor\" within the bermed area measured 7 ft by 7 ft. The overall footprint of the bermed area was 85 ft by 85 ft. The volume of the BCR interior was 4,380 cu ft. Photo 1. Inside of pilot cell with berms prior to liner placement. To provide hydraulic control, the inside of the cell was covered by a 6-ounce polypropylene geotextile; overlain by an impermeable 20-mil high-density cross-laminated liner (photo 2). The liner and geotextile were Permalon in products from Reef Industries, Inc. of Hous ton, Texas. Above the liner, 2-inch diameter perforated PVC pipes were placed diagonally 918 from each corner of the level floor to the center of the cell, where they connect with a below- grade 2-inch diameter PVC pipe that drains treated water from the cell. The drain pipe was connected to a water-level control structure consisting of vertical 2-inch diameter PVC pipes bridged by a horizontal 4-inch diameter PVC pipe (p hoto 3). The horizontal pipe was initially positioned to establish a water level in the cell 5 feet above the cell floor. Water drained from the level control structure through a 2-inch diameter PVC pipe buried approximately 1-foot below grade to discharge into the dewatering trench approximately 90 ft downstream from intake point for the cell. Photo 2 . Geomembrane liner. Photo 3 . Effluent water level control structure. 919 The BCR cell was filled with organic substrate which serves as a long-term carbon source for microbial activity. The substrate was a mixture by as-received weight of 30% sawdust, 30% and 20% limestone screener fines. All materials were obtained from local suppliers. Substrate mixing and placement are shown in photos 4 and 5 . Perforated, two-inch PVC standpipes were placed in the BCR substrate during construction to serve as substrate sampling ports. Substrate samples were packed into panty hose baggies and inserted into the PVC standpipes. Each baggie was tied off with string that could be retrieved from the top of the standpipe to allow sample removal during pilot operation. Photo 4 . Substrate mixing. Photo 5. Substrate placement completed. Vertical standpipes are substrate sample ports. Water was pumped from the dewatering trench to the top of the cell. A pump was placed into a sump created by setting a perforated plastic garbage can on the bottom of the trench (photos 6 and 7). The pump was connected to PVC piping, which ran just below the water level into the side of the trench, then about 1 foot underground from the edge of the trench to the top of the berm. The water was delivered to the cell through a perforated PVC pipe running from the cell edge to the cell center (p hoto 8). 920 Photo 6 . Influent pumps in pump container. Photo 8 .

In order to insulate the BCR, wood chips were added to the top of the substrate in the cell to create a mound about 2 ft high at the center sloping down to the top of the berm along the sides. A 10-mil high-density cross-laminated polyethylene liner (Permalon, Reef Industries) wa s installed on top of the wood chips for insulation and to prevent precipitation from infiltrating into the cell (photo 9 ). 921 Photo 9 . Influent hose on top of liner cover. Operation After filling the cell with water from the trench for the first time, this water was retained in the cell for three weeks to incubate the microorganisms. At the end of this period, the pump was turned on and the study commenced. The first sampling event occurred on 11 September 2008. Routine operation of the BCR consisted of periodic sampling and analysis (described in the next section), measurement of flow through the cell, and flow rate adjustments. From 11 September 2008 to 27 March 2009, flow was measured as it exited the cell at the water level control structure. Outflow was diverted through a valve in the horizontal pipe (bridging the two vertical pipes) into a calibrated bucket. From 27 March 2009 until the end of data collection on 5 October 2009, flow was measured as it entered the cell using a calibrated bucket and stopwatch. As the study progressed, Se concentrations in the trench dropped to unacceptably low concentrations (typically less than 20 \u00b5g/L). Investigation showed that a separate branch of the dewatering trench draining the west side of the pit had highe r Se concentrations. From 11 May 2009 until the end of data collection, water was pumped from this trench through approximately 325 ft of 1.5-inch diameter PVC non -rigid tubing to discharge into a depression excavated in the wood chips at the center top of the cell. A ball valve was used to control the flow rate of the discharge. 922 Sampling and Analysis Samples were collected samples and field parameters measured at roughly 10-day intervals (except when the water delivery system was not operating properly) for a total of 32 events. A list of field parameters is provided in Table 1 . From 30 September 2008 to 8 June 2009, grab samples of influent were collected and field measurements were performed in situ on water in the trench. From 8 June 2009 to the end of the project, influent water was sampled and measured as it pooled and infiltrated at the top of the cell. Grab samples of effluent were collected from the water-level control structure; field parameters were measured here in situ as well. All samples were collected into bottles provided by ACZ Laboratories (Steamboat Springs, Colorado) and pre-filled with appropriate preservatives. Table 1.

Samples were collected and analyzed for an extended sampling suite (Table 3) on ten occasions. Substrate samples were collected on four occasions (17 March 2009, 6 August 2009, 16 September 2009, 5 October 2009) and submitted for Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) testing. ACZ Laboratories (Steamboat Springs, Colorado) performed all sample analysis. 923 Table 2. List of Analytes and Standard Methods Analyte Analytical B, AA -hydride Calculated Selenium, dissolved 3114 AA -hydride 5210 B Total organic carbon 5310 B Nitrate/nitrite as N 353.2 Nitrogen, 6010B analysis Samples to be analyzed for total Se were collected without filtration into laboratory-provided bottles containing enough concentrated HNO 3 acid to lower the sample pH to a value < 2 for preservation. These unfiltered samples are prepared for analysis by digestion, which involves refluxing with HNO 3 and HCl acids to dissolve any Se that may be present in the solid phase within the sample ( e.g., sorbed to particulate matter, or in a form that is insoluble under ambient conditions). Samples to be analyzed for dissolved Se were filtered at the time of collection and preserved in a similar manner. The normal laboratory procedure is to analyze the filtered sample directly for Se without digestion. On some occasions, dissolved Se concentrations were greater than total Se concentrations. A strategy for mitigating the occurrence of dissolved Se exceeding total Se is to digest the filtered samples in the same manner as the unfiltered samples for analysis of total Se. One possible explanation for the success of this modified method is the presence of volatile Se species in effluent samples. The dissolved digestion method is less vigorous and removes a lesser amount 924 of the volatile Se; the total digestion is more vigorous and removes more volatile Se. Within the first month of sampling, three occurrences of the problem were observed: effluent samples on 11 September 2008 (total Se of 1.5 \u00b5g/L, dissolved Se of 14 \u00b5g/L); effluent samples on 23 September 2008 (total Se of 1.1 \u00b5g/L, dissolved Se of 4 \u00b5g/L); and influent samples on 9 October 2008 (total Se of 19.5 \u00b5g/L, dissolved Se of 26.6 \u00b5g/L). Re-analysis of the filtered samples, following digestion, yielded results that better met expectations. For 11 September 2008 , the revised result was 1.1 \u00b5g/L (<1.5 \u00b5g/L); for 23 September 2008, the revised result was 1.2 \u00b5g/L (~1.1 \u00b5g/L); and for 9 October 2008, the revised result was 20.8 \u00b5g/L (~19.5 \u00b5g/L). We adopted the practice of digesting filtered samples for the remainder of the study. Consequently, the problem only occurred in an additional three samples (influent samples on 21 October 2008, 4 April 2009, and 5 May 2009) over 28 remaining sampling events. BCR treatment results and discussion Field Parameters pH. Influent pH ranged from 7.0 to 8.1 s.u. and effluent pH ranged from 6.8 to 7.5 s.u. Temperature. Influent field temperature ranged from 0.8 to 20.3 degrees Celsius (oC) with an average of 13.6 oC (F ig. 1). Effluent field temperature ranged from 8.1 to 21.0oC with an average of 14.9oC. During winter months, the influent temperatures are significantly higher than ambie nt temperatures because the influent water is groundwater seepage. The relatively warm winter-time influent temperatures were likely beneficial in maintaining biological treatment activity. Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP).ORP values measured with an Ag/AgCl electrode were corrected to standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) values ( Fig. 2). The influent ORP values averaged 261 millivolts (mv); effluent measurements were consistently reducing, with an average of -106 mv. Negative ORP values indicate anaerobic conditions conducive to Se reduction. 925 Figure 1. Pilot temperature values. -400-300-200-1000100200300400500ORP (mV) Date Influent Effluent Figure 2. Pilot oxidation reduction potential values. 926 Dissolved Oxygen . Influent dissolved oxygen ranged from 1.2 to 13 mg/L with an average of 5.0 mg/L. BCR effluent dissolved oxygen ranged from 0.0 to 1.3 mg/L with an average of 0.3 mg/L. The consistently low effluent dissolved oxygen values are consistent with the negative ORP values and indicate that the BCR effluent was consistently anaerobic. Flow and Hydraulic Retention Time. The pilot flow rate ranged from 1.7 gallons per minute (gpm) to 24 gpm (7 to 91 Liters per minute). Hydraulic retention time (HRT) was calculated based on flow rate and an estimated BCR pore space volume of 57 cubic yards. HRT ranged from 0.4 days (10 hours) to 6.1 days. Flow rate and HRT values, which are inversely related, are shown on F ig. 3. One goal of the pilot study was to optimize performance by varying Se loading rates. As such, the influent flow rate was continually increased during the last three months of the study in order to gauge Se treatment performance under different loading rates. Figure 3. Pilot flow rate and hydraulic retention time (hrt). Alternate Electron Acceptors The rate of microbial reduction of Se can be affected by the presence of alternate electron acceptors such as nitrate and sulfate (Masschelyn and Patrick 1993). Nitrate is a more favorable electron acceptor than selenate and typically must be complete ly removed before significant Se 927 reduction can occur. Sulfate, on the other hand, is a less favorable electron acceptor than selenate. In theory, sulfate reduction should be minimized in a Se-reducing BCR to minimize carbon ( i.e., substrate) utilization and sulfide generation. Nitrate/nitrite. Influent nitrate/nitrite values were variable, ranging from 0.4 to 17.1 mg/L as N with an average of 7.1 mg/L as N. Effluent nitrate/nitrite values ranged from 0.1 to 9.7 mg/L as N with an average of 3.1 mg/L as N. Nitrate/nitrite removal occurs via denitrification which reduces nitrate/nitrite to nitrogen gas. Percent nitrate/nitrite removal values are shown on F ig. 4, which provides a comparison of nitrate/nitrite, Se, and sulfate removal. 0102030405060708090100Percent Removal Selenium Nitrate/nitrite Sulfate Figure 4. Selenium, Nitrate/Nitrite, and Sulfate Percent Removals. Sulfate and sulfide. Influent sulfate ranged from 410 to 2700 mg/L with an average of 1495 mg/L. Initial effluent concentrations (30 September 2008 through 28 April 2009), analyzed by gravimetric method (SM 4500), were higher than influent concentrations which is unlikely given anaerobic conditions demonstrated by negative ORP values and the observed increase in sulfide concentrations in the BCR effluent. Influent sulfide concentrations were consistently below the laboratory detection limit of 0.01 mg/L; effluent sulfide concentrations averaged 18.7 mg/L. Beginning with samples collected on 19 June 2008, sulfate samples were analyzed by 928 two additional methods: turbidimetry (EPA 375.4) and ion chromatography (EPA 300.0). The turbidimetry and ion chromatography methods provided more consistent results indicating varying levels of sulfate removal. Selenium Total Selenium. Influent total Se concentrations varied considerably from 0.005 to 0.080 mg/L with an average of 0.034 mg/L (F ig. 5). Effluent concentrations ranged from 0.001 to 0.031 mg/L with an average of 0.005 mg/L. The percent removal for total Se ranged from 32 to 98% as shown on F ig. 5. Removal rates equal to or greater than 98% were achieved with a hydraulic retention times ranging from 12 hours to 2.4 days (F ig. 6). This large range in performance is discussed below in the Se loading section. A consistent Se removal rate greater than 90% was typically achieved with a HRT greater than 2 days. Total Se concentrations and percent removal values are provided in Table 4 . The percent removal rate was consistently above 90% during winter months; Se removal was not adversely affected by cold winter-time temperatures. Figure 5. Total selenium concentrations and percent removal. 929 Table 4. Total Selenium Concentrations by ICP -MS Method Date Laboratory Detection ranged from 0.005 to 0.077 mg/L with an average of 0.036 mg/L (F ig. 6). The similarity between dissolved and total concentrations indicates that nearly all influent Se was present as dissolved. Effluent concentrations ranged from 0.0004 to 0.030 mg/L with an average of 0.006 mg/L. The percent removal for dissolved Se ranged from 36.7 to 98.7% as shown on F ig. 6. Dissolved Se concentrations and percent removal values are provided in Table 5. Figure 6. Dissolved selenium concentrations and percent removal. Selenium Speciation. Influent and effluent speciation results are provided on Tables 6 and 7, respectively. The dissolved Se results by method SM3114B (Tables 6 and 7) differ somewhat from the dissolved Se results by ICP-MS (Table 5). Selenate was the predominant influent species with consistently low concentrations of selenite. The influent selenide concentrations were elevated and also varied considerably between sampling events. Although the data are limited, the BCR process does not appear to increase the more toxic concentrations of reduced Se species (i.e. , selenite, selenide); effluent selenite and selenide concentrations were lower than influent concentrations and the majority of effluent selenide concentrations were below the detection limit. Furthermore, the effluent concentrations show consistent selenide removal 931 Table 5.

One potential selenide removal mechanism is precipitation of metal selenides such as iron selenide. Table 6.

Selenium Mass Removal. Selenium mass removal varied from 0.097 grams per day (g/day) to 6.4 g/d and the cumulative Se removal (F ig. 7) over the 13 -month operating period was about 600 grams. Figure 7. Cumulative total selenium removal. 934 Selenium Loading. Selenium loading and removal (milligrams per day per cubic meter of substrate) is shown on F ig. 8. The loading graph values are calculated based on influent and effluent Se concentrations and flow rate only. In general, the majority of data points follow a linear trend with a slight decrease in slope at higher loading rates. The maximum removal rate was 73 milligrams per day per cubic meter of BCR media (mg/d/m3) and the average rate was 16 mg/d/m3. The three data points that do not fit the trend are circled on the figure. These three points correspond to high influent nitrate concentrations which likely partially explain the decrease in treatment performance. The relative scatter of the loading graph values is likely due to other factors which can affect the removal rate, including temperature and presence of alternate electron acceptors ( i.e., nitrate), which are not included in the calculated values. A nitrate/nitrite loading graph was also developed and is shown in F ig. 9. Although nitrate/nitrite data are somewhat limited, the highest calculated nitrate removal rate is about 10 g/d/m3. The design of future BCR systems should consider both Se and nitrate/nitrite loading criteria. Figure 8. Selenium loading. 935 Figure 9. Nitrate + Nitrite Loading Residual Nutrients. Initial effluent concentrations (9 September 2008) of total organic carbon (TOC), total kjedhal nitrogen (TKN), and phosphorus were 437 mg/L, 11.1 mg/L as N, and 6.4 mg/L, respectively; after thirteen months of operation (30 September 2009), effluent concentrations decreased to 13 mg/L, 1.6 mg/L as N, and 0.05 mg/L, respectively. This large decrease is likely due to flushing of easily degradable organic matter (i.e., manure) and nutrients from the cell. Fecal coliform. Fecal coliform bacteria are an indicator of fecal contamination. Since animal manure was used as a BCR substrate ingredient, two BCR effluent samples (30 September 2009, 5 October 2009) were collected near the end of the study and analyzed for fecal coliform concentrations. During both sampling events, the effluent fecal coliforms were less than influent concentrations; the effluent concentration on 5 October 2009 was 0 colony forming units per 100 mL. Similar to the concentration trends of the residual nutrients discussed above, the fecal coliform concentrations were likely elevated during startup and decreased throughout the pilot test. 936 Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) Testing TCLP testing was performed in order to evaluate disposal options for BCR substrate. All substrate TCLP samples were below the method detection limit for Se. The method detection limit (0.1 mg/L) is well below the hazardous waste regulatory limit (1.0 mg/l) for TCLP Se concentrations (40 CFR 261, Appendix II, 1993 ed., as amended by 58 FR 46040, August 31, 1993). The selenium-negative TCLP results occurred after only 1 year of operation which does not provide a conclusive indication of TCLP results from a system which operates for the lifetime of the carbon substrate (approx. 10 to 20 years). However, given the trace concentrations of Se in the influent water and the buffering capacity of the BCR limestone content, it is likely that a BCR could operate for multiple years prior to exceeding the TCLP Se limit. Treatment Costs The capital costs for the pilot cell include materials ( e.g., geomembrane liner, piping, pumps, wood chips, and hay), engineering, and construction labor. A significant portion of the construction effort included heavy equipment operation for berm construction and substrate mixing and placement and was provided in-kind by United Sand and Gravel Operations. This portion of the construction cost has been estimated and is included in the capital costs. The total capital cost estimate for the pilot was $39,200 and can roughly be divided into $15,000 for engineering, $8,000 for materials, and $15,700 for labor. Assuming a flow rate of 10 gpm and an operating life of 15 years, the capital cost is equivalent to $0.50 per 1,000 gallons of water treated. Assuming 600 grams of Se removal per year, the pilot BCR would remove 9 kilograms of Se over a 15 year operating life which equates to a mass removal cost of $4,400 per kilogram of Se. The operating costs consisted of electricity for the influent pump, laboratory analysis of water quality samples, and the labor required maintaining flow to the cell. At sites where BCR systems do not require any pumping and operate via gravity flow, operational costs are minimal. The disadvantages of a BCR are the large area required and uncertainty regarding long-term performance. Conclusions The 13-month pilot BCR study test was successful in removing Se on a consistent year- round basis. The BCR achieved a maximum total Se removal rate of 98% and a minimum effluent 937 concentration of 0.0005 mg/L (0.5 \u00b5g/L). The maximum percent removal rate of 98% was achieved with a range of hydraulic retention times of 12 hours to 2.4 days. The variability in Se removal as a function of HRT is likely due to varying concentrations of Se and nitrate and temperature. In general, a HRT of 2 days is recommended to consistently achieve removal rates greater than 90% for the site. A HRT of at least two days is recommended for future treatment efforts at the site. Other sites would require testing to determine an appropriate HRT; a reasonable estimate of HRT can be made based on dissolved oxygen, nitrate, and Se concentrations. In terms of Se mass removal, the highest mass removal rate achieved by the BCR was 73 mg/day/m3 and the cumulative mass of total Se removal was 600 grams. In order for significant Se removal to occur, nitrate/nitrite must first be removed. The highest measured nitrate/nitrite removal rate was approximately 10 g/d/m3. The treatment or nitrate is an ancillary benefit to biological treatment of Se. The BCR treatment process was effective throughout the cold winter months during which total Se removal rates remained greater than 90%. Based on the TCLP results, the BCR substrate is not toxic with respect to Se and passive treatment residues can be disposed of in a non-hazardous waste landfill. The BCR effluent contains residual nutrients and bacteria that must be considered in the design of a full-scale treatment system. These parameters can be removed in a polishing process such as an aerobic lagoon or wetland. The total capital cost for the pilot BCR was $39,200 or $0.50 per 1,000 gallons treated. The operations and maintenance costs for a passive BCR system are minimal. Based on the successful operation of the pilot, including high rates of Se removal and consistent year-round operation, the BCR technology appears to be an effective, low-cost Se treatment option. The disadvantages of a BCR are the large area required and uncertainty regarding long- term performance.

Benets of using passive treatment systems Andr\u00e9 S OBOLEWSKI AMEC, 111 Dunsmuir St, Vancouver, BC, V6B 5W3 Abstract Using liquid carbon sources provides tangible benets for bioreactors treating mine water. Microbial activity can be maintained at <4\u00b0C, which allows bioreactors to function in cold climates, as shown for bioreactors at the Tulsequah Chief and Smoky River Coal mines. Such carbon sources do notrestrict the choice of matrices supporting bacterial growth. This benet is illustrated in another biore-actor designed to avoid plugging problems associated with decomposing organic matter. The latter iswidely perceived as a cheap and sustained carbon source for microbial growth. However, liquid carbonsources overcome its limitations imposed by temperature and susceptibility to plugging. Key Words bioreactors, liquid carbon, temperature, plugging Introduction Passive treatment systems are often idealized as \"walk-away\" solutions: systems that treat water without an operator and little to no maintenance. In part, this ideal draws after natural wetlandsthat were shown to detoxify mine drainage, at times for decades (Sobolewski, 1997). The promiseof a walk-away solution is especially appealing at closed mines in remote locations where accessis dicult and power is typically unavailable. One type of passive treatment system is the bioreactor, which relies on microbial processes to detoxify mine water. Bioreactor design is strongly guided by the walk-away ideal, typically usinga compost/manure mix that slowly decomposes to supports the requisite microbial processes.The key weaknesses of this design are a propensity to become plugged and reduced function atlow temperatures. The most successful bioreactors have been operated in warm climates (e.g., Cel-lan et al., 1997) or have resolved the problems of residual management (e.g., Kepler and McLeary,1997). One approach to circumvent these limitations is to supply liquid carbon, such as alcohol, rather than rely on organic matter decomposition. These bioreactors are termed \"enhanced\" pas-sive systems, though the distinction is academic. This approach has been strongly promoted byTsukamoto and Miller (e.g., 2002), but it has been used by others in the past twenty years (e.g.,Reinsel and Plumb, 1999). Despite its advantages, use of liquid carbon for bioreactors is not preva-lent, perhaps because of the perception that such bioreactors cannot become walk-away systems. Low temperature treatment Use of a liquid carbon source proved crucial for the successful operation of a bioreactor at theTulsequah Chief Mine, in Northern BC, Canada. This polymetallic (Cu, Pb/Zn) underground minewas abandoned in the late 1980's and discharged ARD into the Tulsequah River. The highly acidic water (Table 1) flowed from the lowest portal at 5\u20147 L/sec. Environment Canada required the new owner to treat water during mine exploration, an understandable but onerous demand for the cash-strapped junior. Treatment options were severely constrained by limitations imposed by the site. The two main portals discharged on the side of a steep, remote mountain, with little flat land available. Access was by helicopter, power was provided by a small diesel generator and equipment was verylimited. There was no room for a conventional lime treatment, which, in any event, would have been prohibitively expensive. A bioreactor was eventually developed inside the lowest adit: it com- bined limestone to neutralize acidity and remove aluminum and iron, and sulfate-reducing bac-teria (SRB) to remove other metals. Its design was intended to provide treatment duringexploration and until mine start up, when better nancing and cash flow would allow the devel- opment of a more robust solution. A 66m\u00b3 pilot-scale bioreactor was rst constructed and tested inside the adit. Unfortunately, wood mulch decomposition was too slow at 6\u20148\u00b0C (ambient temperature) to keep the bioreactor anaerobic, with dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations remaining at 8\u20149 mg/L. Ethylene glycol(EG) was supplied to mine water, which quickly decreased dissolved oxygen concentrations toSydney, NS IMWA 2010 \"Mine Water and Innovative 2010 2010-08-16 05:34 Page 279near zero. SRB started being active soon thereafter, as evident by detection of hydrogen sulde and the concomitant removal of cadmium and copper (Table 1). Based on this trial, a 200m long, 5 cell bioreactor was constructed inside the lowest mine adit. The rst three cells received a wood chip/limestone mix to neutralize pH and remove aluminumand iron. The last two cells also received sulfur prills to promote SRB activity. Ethylene glycol wasdripped into Cell 1 (to remove oxygen) and Cell 4 (to support SRB activity). The front limestone cells gradually failed (over four years) from accumulated sludge, yet con- sistently removed aluminum and iron, while the SRB cell removed cadmium, copper, and somezinc (Table 1). Most remarkable, the bioreactor operated without human intervention from Octo-ber to April, when the site was shut down and inaccessible. Despite the (expected) cell failures,the bioreactor provided low cost ( $50,000/yr for EG) treatment and enabled the company tosuccessfully complete its exploration program. Another bioreactor that relied on EG was constructed at the Smoky River Coal mine, which produces selenium contaminated drainage. Again, the lack of power and cost constraints dictatedthe choice of a bioreactor for passive treatment, but the design challenge was to provide year-round treatment. A trial was conducted in 2008, using two parallel 5 m\u00b3 pilot-scale bioreactors (5 m long x 1 m\u00b2) that received a mix of crushed gravel, wood chip/manure, lime and bone meal. The objective ofthe trial was to determine treatment performance during summer and winter operation and toderive design parameters for a full-scale bioreactor. The bioreactors were inoculated with sele-nium-reducing bacteria and received EG. Although they were constructed at the surface, it wasintended that the full-scale bioreactor would be constructed below the frost line so that it couldoperate year-round. The bioreactors proved very effective in removing selenium (Figure 1). They received drainage with selenium at 80\u201490 \u00b5g/L and consistently discharged it at 1\u20145 \u00b5g/L. Treatment performancewas unaffected by temperature, even when it decreased to 2\u00b0C. Unfortunately, Alberta Environment terminated the trials in 2008 and did not proceed to construction of the full-scale treatment system.IMWA 2010 Sydney, NS \"Mine Water and Innovative Thinking\" Wolkersdorfer & Freund (Editors) 280 P a r a m e t e r A R D P i l o t - s c a l e bioreactor (after EG addition) Full-scale bioreactor (Limestone cells only) in drainage and discharge from Tulsequah Chief bioreactors Figure 1 Selenium removal as a function of temperature at Smoky River CoalProceedings_Theme_04_n_Proceedings IMWA 2010 2010-08-16 05:34 Page 280Design to prevent plugging It was not surprising that the bioreactor at Tulsequah Chief would become plugged because the design did not allow for effective removal of aluminum and iron. However, the design allowedfor continual operation in spite of accumulating metal sludge, which was adequate for a tempo-rary treatment system. A more porous medium might have prevented metal accumulation, butit may not have provided enough reactive surface area for proper treatment. This trade-off be-tween high reactive surface and high porosity is at the crux of bioreactor design. The US EPA sponsored a number of studies to develop designs that overcome the plugging problems associated with decomposing organic matter. Different SRB-based bioreactors weretested at the Calliope Mine by holding the organic substrate and cobble in a cellular containmentsystem (Terracell TM) to prevent channeling and uneven settling (MSE, 2002). Despite careful con- struction, substrate compaction and plugging problems developed in some of the bioreactors.Subsequent projects helped to improve design (Bless et al., 2008). Trading off permeability with flow rates is a problem inherent to the use of decomposing or- ganic matter. Unfortunately, this was not possible in the case of an operating undergroundlead/zinc (condential) mine. The neutral underground drainage was contaminated with low con-centrations of blasting residues (largely nitrate) and zinc, but proximity to a sh-bearing lake pre-vented its direct discharge. The restricted space underground and high volumes of drainagemeant that high permeability and high reactive surface area were both necessary. The solution involved designing a high-rate bioreactor that could be shoehorned into a sump at the bottom of the mine. This bioreactor used a matrix comprising elemental sulfur, crushedlimestone and Raschig rings (ceramic saddles with high surface area). Its design involved a two-part treatment of mine water: a front section with sulfur-based denitriers to remove oxygenand nitrate, and to produce sulfate, and a back section seeded with SRB that received ethanol andremoved zinc. This bioreactor design was evaluated using two 2.5 m long columns inside the mine. The columns were fed mine water and operated with decreasing residence times. Although dissolved oxygen concentrations were not measured, measurements of oxidation- reduction potential (ORP) indicated that oxygen was entirely removed in the rst column (Table2). Similarly, nitrate was rapidly removed in the rst column, even though the retention time inthat column was (at its lowest) 1.5 hours. Nitrate removal was clearly effected by sulfur-based den-itrication, because sulfate concentrations in the column discharge increased by an average of100 mg/L, very close to theoretically-predicted concentrations based on stoichiometry. Inflow into the SRB column was anaerobic, but it received ethanol to support SRB activity. Despite increasing influent zinc concentrations and decreasing overall retention time, zinc re-moval in the second column produced a discharge with average concentrations of 0.029 mg/L(Figure 2). This consistency was maintained throughout the entire four month trial, indicatingthat the bioreactor was robust. Its fast performance can be attributed to the high surface area ofthe matrix used in the columns, although warm underground temperatures (21\u201422\u00b0C) helped.Unfortunately, the client opted for a different treatment system, so it was not possible to deter-mine the performance of a full-scale system. Conclusions Arguably, bioreactor designs that use liquid carbon provide improved performance and reliability. As the Tulsequah Chief bioreactor demonstrates, even such \"enhanced\" passive treatment sys- tems can be operated unattended for prolonged periods at remote mine sites. Moreover, the lowtemperatures at which they can operate, as shown at Tulsequah and with the Smoky River Coal pilot-scale bioreactor, indicate that they can provide year-round treatment in cold climates.

Conceivably, supplying ethanol or ethylene glycol to such bioreactors or constructed wetlands could sustain treatmentduring the winter in cold climates. The reagent costs for operating these bioreactors were modest, rendering moot the argument that decomposing organic matter is preferable because it is a cheaper source of organic carbon.Taking away this argument, the choice of carbon source should be dictated by availability, year-round performance and reliability in treatment. In many circumstances, this gives the advantageto systems using liquid carbon sources. References Bless, D. B. Park, S. Nordwick, M. Zaluski, H. Joyce, R. Hiebert and C. Clavelot. 2008.

V6J 3H9 2Inotec Environmental Innovations, 85 S Ft. Douglas Blvd. Salt Lake City, UT 84112 ABSTRACT The removal of selenium (Se) from water using passive technologies at mine sites is challenging as a result of associated high flow rates . However, the chemical and hydraulic conditions of backfilled pits offer a potential means to bioremediate large volumes of water passively . Specifically, t he oxidation deman d associated carbonaceous waste materials in conjunction with long water residence time s within backfilled pits can produce the suboxic conditions required to support the removal of Se from solution through a suite of microbially -mediated processes. Evidence for Se removal is prov ided from a study of a backfilled pit at a coal min e in Northern Canada . Redox conditions within the saturated backfill are mildly -suboxic , as inferred from low levels of oxygen, nitrate and the presence of dissolved Mn and Fe. Results show pronounced removal of dissolved Se within the saturated backfill , with concentrations decreasing from 40 \u00b5g/L (upgradient of saturated zone) to <1 \u00b5g/L within the saturated waste rock zone. The reduction in Se concentration was accompanied by a shift in Se speciation from dominantly selenate (SeVI) path . Nitrate -N values are also reduced to values below detection (<0.05 mg/L) in the saturated backfill. The data suggest that this relatively small backfilled pit achieves a Se removal r ate ranging from 0.03 to 0.3 mg/day/ 3 with a hydraulic residence time of 0.3 to 3 years. Collectively, the data imply that the saturated backfilled zones are serving as an effective site for the bioremediation of Se under mildly suboxic conditions . KEY WORDS Selenium removal rate, bioremediation , passive treatment INTRODUCTION The bioremediation of selenium (Se) from mine waters using passive systems (e.g., subsurface -flow biological reactors and permeable reactive barriers) has received considerable attention owing to the prevalence of elevated Se concentrations in coal -mine drainages (CH2MHill, 2013) . Selenium is naturally abundant in rocks with sedimentary facies hosting carbonaceous shale s and shales having particularly hi gh levels; natural ranges documented are 206- 280 mg kg-1 and 1 -675 mg kg-1, respectively (Fern \u00e1ndez-Martinez and Charlet, 2009) . These rock types typically make up a fraction of the waste rock material at coal mines and constitute a major source of selenium to groundwater and surface water receptors . Toxicity is manifested as reproductive impairment due to maternal transfer resulting in juvenile abnormality or embryo death ( Chapman et al., 2009). In coal mine wastes, Se may be associated with both reduced sulphur species (e.g., pyrite) and as discrete reduced Se compounds (e.g., elemental Se and selenides ). The release of Selenium from source rocks is hypothesized through the following reactions : Oxidation of selenide to selenite ()+ 32 + (1) of to selenate 32+2 42 (2) Both selenite and selenate have an affinity to absorb onto ferric oxyhydroxides ; however, the selenate molecule has a lower sorptive affinity rendering it more mobile (Su and Suarez, 2000, Lo and Chen, 1997, Zhang and Sparks, 1990) . The backfilling of wasterock into the voids of open pits offers considerable potential for Se management with respect to both remobilization and attenuation. From a remobilization perspective, the backfilling of waste rock below the water table in open pits will act to shut down oxidation mechanisms responsible for the release of Se to solution. In saturated settings, the oxidation of these reduced species is effe ctively curtailed, thereby reducing the potential for Se remobilization. This relates to the tendency of oxygen to become depleted in saturated pore spaces, and more importantly, to the diffusion -controlled replacement of dissolved oxygen to reaction sites, which is very slow . In terms of attenuation, the presence of suboxic conditions is a pre -requisite for effective Se attenuation in saturated settings, whereby the removal of Se can occur via: 1) adsorption of selenite; 2) precipitation of elemental Se; 3) precipitation of Se as inorganic/organic selenides; and 4) co -precipitation of Se with reduced sulphur. Suboxia is also required to reduce nitrate, the presence of which can inhibit Se reduction and selenite sorption (Dhillon and Dhillon, 2000). Sinc e backfilled -pit environments have the potential to develop suboxia, these systems offer significant potential with regards to Se attenuation. This paper summarizes the findings of a field-based hydrogeologic program that a ssessed the nature of Se behaviou r in the saturated backfilled portion of a relatively small pit located in the Rocky Mountain Foothill region of northeastern B ritish Columbia, Canada. The results have broad -scale application to the management of and treatment Se at coal mines and other mining environments that are characterized by Se enrichment (e.g., phos phate mines, metal mines). SITE DESCRIPTION AND METHODS The investigation was conducted at an active coal mining operation located in the Rocky Mountain Foothills in the northeastern portion of British Columbia, Canada . The Rocky Mountain Foothills are part of the continental- scale Foreland Fold and Thrust Belt forming the eastern margin of the North American Cordillera. Elevations range from 1,830 m to 2,130 m while precipitation ranges from 500 to 1,000 mm annually with more than 60 % falling as snow. The hydrogeology of the region consists of a shallow water table (unconfined) system within the overlying surficial (quaternary -aged) sediments where present, and a bedrock system in fractured sedimentary rocks with hydraulic conductivity ranging from 10-10 ms-1 for a low -permeability shale to 10-3 ms-1 for a vuggy limestone . The foothills are underlain by a succession of marine and non- marine sedimentary rocks (B.C. Environment, 1994) . This section provides a description of the pit shell physiology, characteristics of the backfilled (waste rock) material, the design of the porewater/groundwater monitoring network, methods for collecting and analyzing porewater samples. Backfilled Pit Physiology The coal reserve associated with the study site is situated on a small synclinal structure minimizing the strip ratio which resulted in the development of an elongated shallow open pit approximately ~ 1000 m long, ~150 to 200 m wide and ~50 m deep . Approximately 1.6 million tonnes of pulverized coal injection (PCI) grade coal was excavated from the pit u sing typical surface mining techniques relying on blasting and shovel methods . Mining of the pit was completed by 2006 and backfilling of t he pit occurred in 2011. A total of 4.8 Mm3 of waste rock was backfilled into the pit, and of this approximately 0.2 Mm3 is saturated. The maximum depth of the waste rock in pit is on the order of 50 m (mean depth of about 28 m) with saturated thickness of approximately 22 m. The pit shell configuration and the placement of backfilled waste rock is shown in Figure 1. Table 1 summarizes the dimensions of the pit shell, as well as total and saturated backfilled waste rock material. Monitoring Network In November 2011, eleven ( 11) monitoring wells were installed with seven (7) of the wells completed as two monitoring well nests ( MW11- 01 and M W11- 02). A dual rotary (Barber) rig w as used to advance the boreholes through waste rock and bedrock and to install the monitoring wells. All monitoring wells consist of 2 -inch schedule 80 polyvinylchloride (PVC). Table 2 summarizes the details of the monitoring well installations. Water quality profiling within the saturated portion of the in -pit dump was accomplished with the use of nested monitoring wells with 5- foot long screens (1.5 m) (Elci et al. 2001). The location of these wells with respect to the in-pit dump is shown on Figure 1. The monitoring wells were placed along the centerline of the pit shell bottom as determined from a 2011 Lidar survey. MW11-01 and MW11- 02 consist of four (4) and three (3) nested wells, respectively, installed within the saturated backfilled waste rock. MW11 -04 is screened across the bedrock/wasterock interface upgradient of the saturated zone , and it is assumed that groundwater within this well is representative of water flowing along the bottom of the backfilled pit and representative of non-attenuated source waste rock water . MW11 -03 and MW11- 06 were installed within bedrock adjacent to the pit to characterize background water quality and water levels. Table 1.

Porewater Monitoring and Sampling Select monitoring wells were installed with Solnist Leveloggers\u00ae water level sensors and onset\u00ae HOBO\u00ae conductivity loggers for continuous (hourly) monitoring from November 2011 to March 2013. Table 2 summarizes the distribution of instrumentation among the wells. Manual measurements of water level and fluid conductivity were conducted during each groundwater sampling round. Three (3) rounds of sampling were conducted coinciding with anticipated variations in groundwater level associated with a freshet -dominated hydrologic system. As such , sampling occurred as follows: December 2011 coincident with fall low water levels; July 2012 representing freshet high water levels; and March 2013 representing the stream base flow and lowest water levels. All groundwater wells went through the process of development, purging and sampling. Wells were developed by the drillers using compressed air and air lift system. To minimize artifacts of sampling associated sample quality variability and error, monitor ing wells were purged and sampled using the Low- Flow technique (Varljen et al., 2006; Elci et al. 2001 ). All monitoring wells with the exception MW11- 03 were sampled using the QED bladder pump. MW11-03 was sampled using a Waterra inertial pump. Porewater Sample Analysis Groundwater samples were collected for bulk chemistry, anions, dissolved metals, Se speciation and microbial analyses. Samples for the general aqueous analyses were sent to ALS Laboratories of Burnaby, BC. Se speciation in water was completed at the Trent Water Quality Centre, Trent University similar to the method by Petrov et al. (2012) . The ion chromatography -separation method for Se species followed that of W allschl \u00e4ger and Roehl (2001). S amples for screening of Se -reducing mic robes were sent to Department of Metallurgical Engineering, University of Utah. Microbes from collected samples were analyzed by classical solid media (plating) and liquid culture techniques modified to enumerate both total microbes and Se reducers presen t. RESULTS Backfilled Pit Hydrogeology Continuous water level readings from MW11 -01D along with c ontinuous fluid conduct ance readings from MW11 -01D and MW11 -01A are presented i n Figure 2 for the period December 2011 to May 2013. Water level re cords show that freshet leads to an increase of 2 m in saturated thickness within the waste rock pile . Porewater conductance at the MW11- 01D is observed at MW11 -01A ( 800 uS/cm ), likely an effect of recharge events through the wa ste rock. The effect of recharge, particularly during fr eshet , appear s to reduce the fluid conductance within the saturated backfilled . However, the effect is more pron ounced at the bottom of the pit (i.e., at MW11 -01D). These data indicate there could a preferential flow path for water at the interface of the waste rock and pit bottom. Figure 2. Water levels readings measured at MW11- 01. Continuous readings are shown for MW11-01D which is screened across the water table . Manual measurements are also shown for water table surface map shown in Figure 1 was generated using the manual water measurements observed during March 2013. In general, groundwater flow follows a south -easterly direc tion with deviations in flow patterns at a smaller scale due to influence of the pits. Within the saturated backfilled waste rock, water is predicted to flow r elatively rapidly from the upper unsaturated zone to the downstream zone of saturation (~20 m in thickness) . The water level within the lower saturated section of the pit is controlled by the southern pit wall which acts as decant point. This remnant bedrock wall produces the \"bath tub\" conditions within the lower portion of the in-pit dump. The greatest gradient, ranging from 10% to 20% , occurs between MW11 -04 and MW11- 01 due to the topographic relief between the se two monitoring wells (see Table 3). The horizontal groundwater gradient between MW11 - 01 and MW11- 02 is negligible , however; the var iation in elevation between the in-pit water level and southern pit wall at MW11 -03 is 1.4 % and 2.5% for winter and freshet conditions, respectively. The groundwater heads within the bedrock at MW11 -02A and -02B are 0.25 m lower than that within wasteroc k at MW11-02C, indicating groundwater flow is downward (data not presented). The gradient at MW11 -02 was calculated to be 1.6%. The water elevation in MW11 -03 is higher than MW11- 01 and MW11 -02 indicating an upward gradient in the southern pit wall on the order of 1%. Conceptually, water flow through the pit consists of rainfall infiltrating downward through the waste rock and collecting along the pit bottom. Ponded water then follows along the pit floor to lower elevation where it pools in the lower p ortion of the pit within the 20 m -thick saturated zone. Groundwater exits the pit in two ways: 1) spillage over the bedrock ridge at the southeastern of the pit (see Section B -B' in Figure 1); and 2) downward flow through the underlying bedrock. Groundwater velocities along these flows paths are predicted to be markedly different as the hydraulic conductivity of bedrock making up the pit floor is likely three 3 to 4 orders of magnitude lower than that of the waste rock material. An estimate of waste rock hydraulic conductivity based on literature values for gravel yields a range of 10-4 to 10-5 m s- 1 whereas, the hydraulic conductivity of the siltstone is predicted to be on the order of 10-7 to 10-10 m s-1 (Freeze and Cherry, 1979). The groundwater flux through the lower pit floor (area = 24,000 m2 see Table 1) is estimated to be 3.3 m3/day ( ~0.04 L/s). Overflow at the decant point is dependent on the porosity of the waste rock material, an uncertainty in flow estimates. It is generally accepted that the porosity of end -dumped waste rock material could vary considerably thus varying the hydraulic conductivity. Estimates of the horizontal flux through the pit assumed a porosity that ranges from 25% to 40% and a hydraulic conductivity of 10-4 to 10-5 ms-1. During winter, the horizontal flux component range from 43 to 430 m3day-1, whereas during freshet, the flux ranges from 80 to 800 m3day-1. Accordingly, the hydraulic residence time of the saturated backfilled pit ranges from 0.5 to 3 years during wint er, and from 0.3 to 2 years during freshet (See Table 3). Pit Water Quality In general, water quality obs erved during the first round is artificially elevated as a result of drilling - related impacts. The disruption to the ambient geochemical environment by mechanical forces and injection of air during drilling can result in sampling artifacts associated with parameters associated with sulfides (e.g., Se), as well as redox- sensitive parameters. Indeed, well development was insufficient to remove all artif acts of drilling for the first round of sampling. As a result of drilling artifacts in the first round of sampling, the following discussion considers only the results of the 2nd and 3rd sampling rounds (May 2012 and March 2013). Redox reactions are inte gral to the biogeochemical processes controlling the attenuation of Se (Masscheleyn et al. 1993; Martin et al., 2011). R edox -sensitive parameters includ e dissolved oxygen (DO) , dissolved nitrate (3), dissolved manganese (Mn) , dissolved iron and hydrogen sulfide ( H2S = S2-, HS- and H 2S). Inspection of the data in Table 4 for DO, nitrate, dissolved Fe, dissolved Mn show evidence of mild suboxia within the saturated portions of the backfilled pit. Dissolved oxygen concentra tions were consistently elevated in the upgradient groundwater (MW11 -04) ranging from 2 to 6.3 mg/L but for the remainder of the wells concentrations were generally below 0.7 mg/L. The presence of dissolved iron in the saturated backfill groundwater would mean that DO is less than observed. Likewise, nitrate levels at MW11 -04 was observed at 1 mg/L and at less than detection limits for the peripheral and bedrock wells. D issolved Mn values for wells screened M W11 -02C, MW11-01- A/B/C) show values ranging from 0. 3 to 0.9 mg/L. Such values are likely indicative of Mn(IV) -oxide reduction. Similarly, the presence of slightly elevated dissolved Fe is indicative of suboxia. Table 3. Hydrogeological parameters and estimates of flow through backfilled pit.

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is present within the porewater of the backfilled pit , although at approximately half the concentrations observed within the peripheral wells. Under the current redox regime , sulphate represents a suitable proxy for waste rock drainage , and concentrations of this parameter can be used to further assess pit hydraulics. Figure 3 summarizes the sulphate levels during the three rounds of sampling. The sulphate levels in those wells screened across the wasterock -pitfloor interf ace, namely, MW11 -01A and MW11-04, are considerably lower during the May 2012 sampling round under freshet recharge conditions. These fluctuations correlate well with the variations observed in the fluid conductance data in Figure 2 indicating that prefer ential flow paths along the pit floor may exist. Further, elevated s ulphate levels in bedrock at MW 11-02 (A/B) support the interpretation of water levels at this location which indicate a downward vertical gradient as background sulfate concentrations are typically less than 100 mg/L, as observed WaterIn-Pit Saturated WaterPeripheral Bedrock Figure 3. Sulfate concentrations measured in water for December 2011, May 2012 and March 2013 sampling rounds for upgradient pit water, saturated backfill and peripheral bedrock. Selenium Total Se, SeIV and SeVI concentrations measured during for each sampling round are summarized in Figure 4 while the mean concentrations 2nd and 3rd sampling rounds are sh own in Figure 5. The highest Se levels are observed upgradient of the saturated zone (MW11 -04), while the lowest values are observed in the peripheral bedrock wells. The Se levels in the in-pit saturated water are consistently below 1 \u00b5g/L. Inspection of the data shows a predominance of SeVI at MW 11-04, comprising on average 95% of the total Se inventory. The reduced form SeIV is present, albeit at low levels (less than 2%). In contrast, the in-pit saturated water shows a predominance of SeIV, on average making up 74% of the total Se inventory. SeIV is also the dominant species within the peripheral bedrock making up 71% of the inventory. The in-pit saturated water contains less than 1% of the Se -T observed at MW11- 04 suggesting that 99% of the Se -T entering the in-pit saturated zone is lost by attenuation through mechanisms which may include adsorption of SeIV, precipitation of elemental Se, or precipitation of metal/organic selenides . This conclusion is supported in the shift in dominant Se species from SeVI in the source water to SeIV within the in-pit saturated water. The reduction in Se concentrations within the backfilled p it cannot be attributed to dilutionary processes, as revealed by the persistence of elevated SO 4 levels and inferred groundwater flow paths which do not indicate significant recharge of more dilute groundwater sources. In this regard, the backfilled pit can be viewed as a passive bioreactor, where suboxic redox processes promote denitrifcation and immobilizatio n of Se . 2011 2012 2013 2011 2012 2013 2011 2012 2013 2011 2012 2013 2011 2012 2013 2011 2012 2013 2011 2012 2013 2011 2012 2013 2011 2012 2013 2011 2012 2013Concentration ( \u00b5g/L) 0.0010.010.11101001000Total Bedrock Figure 4.

Geometric m ean Se -T, SeVI and SeIV concentrations in groundwater of May 2012 and March 2013 sampling rounds for upgradient pit water, saturated backfill and peripheral bedrock. Microbial Communities Results of total microbial and Se -reducer counts in groundwater samples are summari zed in Figure 6. Total microbial counts provide an indication of microbe population viability at time of sampling. The microbial counts over the three sampling periods demonstrate variability in both saturated backfilled and peripheral groundwater wells. Se-reducer s were recorded in only two samples in December 2011 (MW11 -02C- FD) and March 2013 (MW11-04- FD). Although specific counts of Se -reducers were low and varied between sampling events , the potential for selenium reduc tion in the saturated backfilled is better characterized taken into account the results of the selenium containing media microbial analysi s. Se precipitation was observed following two weeks of incubation in samples from MW11-02C- FD and MW11-04. Following a month of incubation, Se reduction was also detected, albeit at much lower levels, in samples MW11 -02B and MW-11-03. Figure 6. Summary of microbial plates counts for upgradient pit water, saturated backfill and peripheral bedrock. Estimates of Selenium Removal Rates Estimate s a Se removal rates are not well constrained due to uncertainty in the upper concentration end member and flow through rate (i.e., water residence time) . Nonetheless, i n-situ Se removal rates were calculated based on the observed difference in total dissolved Se (Se-T) concentration between MW11 -04 (upgradient pit water) and s aturated backfilled porewater during both low (winter) and high (freshet) flow periods. The parameters for the Se removal rate estimates are summarized in Table 5. The mean Se -T concentration observed at MW11- 04 for the May 2012 and March 2013 sampling rounds was 38 \u00b5g/L, and the mean concentration within the saturated backfilled porewater was less than 0.1 \u00b5g/L. As discussed previously, pit flow through rate varies due to uncertainly in waste rock porosity values; accordingly a range of possible flow rates were considered. Overall, removal rates were calculated to range from 0.03 to 0.17 mg/day/m3 of waste rock (winter low flow) and 0.06 to 0.33 mg/day/m3 of waste rock (freshet flow) (Table 5). Table 5.

The monitoring method s employed have specifically allowed delineation of the transport characteristics and bioremediation potential of Se within suboxic zones of the waste rock backfill . The results provide direct evidence of in situ Se reduction under mildly suboxic conditions, commensurate with nitrate reduction. Overall, the data suggest that a significant degree of Se attenuation is occurring within the backfilled pit under relatively short residence times. These results have direct application to coal mines globally that employ pit backfill as part of water/waste management planning. The data also suggest that for larger backfilled systems characterized by longer groundwater retention time, a higher magnitude of Se attenuation could be achieved. In this regard, this form of in situ bioremediation represents a possible means to treat large water volumes not accommodated by traditionally forms of passive treatment (e.g., wetlands, permeable reactive barriers).

Idaho. Waste rock and groundwater from backfilled mine pits, which have been studied using geochemical, microbial cultivation, and molecular methods, host native populations of selenate- (SeO 42-) and selenite- (SeO 32-) reducing bacteria that , Stenotrophomonas , Anaeromyxobacter reduced more than 95% of soluble SeO 42- concentrations. Reduction occur red within a consortium of slow-growing, cold-tolerant , hydrocarbon -degrading, including the genera Polaromonas and Rhodoferax , which appeared to use the naturally -occurring hydrocarbon present in the rock. Most-probable number estimates of SeO 42--reducers were highest in saturated sediments and in unsaturated shale, and were very low in unsaturated chert and mudstone. Se lenium reduction was studied in saturated native , shale, and mixe d run-of- mine sediments inoculated with live groundwater cultures, with sampling and analysis of total Se, Fe, Mn ; Se speciation; NO 3- and sulfate (SO 42-); dissolved organic carbon and total nitrogen (N); and mineralogy . Following an O 2- and N-dependent lag, SeO 42- was reduced within 100 hours under saturated, suboxic conditions at rates that varied depending on lithotype and temperature. The microbial community shifted during reduction as well, from phylotypes associated with the Fe- reducing Rhodoferax and HC- degrading Sphingomonas and SeO 42--reducing Dechloromonas genera to include members of the SeO 32-reducing genus Ralstonia. A unique biogeochemical Se reduction pathway was suggested in chert experiments, where Se reduction proceeded more rapidly and produced SeO 32- and elemental Se products, relative to the shal e, wh erein reduction was slower and produce d more reduced selenide mineral s. Results of these experiments offer insight into the results of in situ monitoring in ba ckfill at multiple locations in S .E. Idaho, and potentially explain differences in Se solubility at these locations. Strategic management of rock and water in constructed mine wastefacilities to limit O 2 recharge can thus promote SeO 42- reduction by communities of indigenous organisms using available carbon and other electron donors. This offers a sustainable, design - based approach to natural attenuation of Se in mined rock. 1 CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION Selenium (Se) release associated with weathering of phosphate mine waste is recognized as a risk for human health and the environment in the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area (Figure 1) . Bioaccumulation of Se released by mined phosphate waste rock has resulted in toxicosis in horses and sheep graz ed on affected vegetation , and increased concentrations of Se water have been measured at some locations [3, 4]. Awareness of this risk has prompted significant efforts on the part of phosphate producers, state and federal agencies, and other investigators to describe mechanisms of Se release and attenuation associated with mined phosphate wastes . Various research initiatives have addressed questions of health and environmental risk [ 5], mineralogy [6-10], Se speciation [11-13], and affected sediments [14] of the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area. Results of these studies have offered insight into the biogeochemical processes that influence Se release from surficial deposits of phosphate wa ste rock . This study describes the Se biogeochemistry of mined phosphate overburden under subsurface conditions and evaluates factors influencing the extent of native microbial reduction of selenate (SeO 42-) as a potential method of operational source control in backfilled mine waste. 2 Figure 1. Location of S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area, showing Enoch Valley, Dry Valley and Smoky Canyon mines with studied drillholes and monitoring wells. Project History and Location Results of in situ monitoring and laboratory testing show that Se hydrogeochemistry in the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area varies , depending on waste rock mineralogy and composition, placement and location of waste rock, site hydrology and geochemical weathering processes [2, 15, 16]. The central finding that prompted this research was that concentrations of Se in groundwater within backfilled mine waste at Agrium Nu-West Industries, Inc .'s (Agrium) Dry Valley Mine are 3 relatively low , in contrast to values measured in surface seeps from external mine waste rock dumps [ 17], near surface lysimeters [2], and shallow monitoring wells [ 2], as well as backfill monitored at other mine sites [15]. At the Dry Valley Mine (Figure 1), low Se concentrations were measured in a monitoring well that was placed in randomly-distributed mine backfill [ 2]. The mine waste backfill deposit at t his location had been reclaimed and covered with a vegetated cover, but had been intermittatly saturation with nitrate (NO 3-)- and SeO 42--bearing water that was pumped out of an active mine pit over a period of a few years. Nitrate and SeO 42- concentrations monitored in the well increased initially, but dropped quickly following each application of pit water (Figure 2). Following the discharge of water onto the backfill, the groundwater returned to its original elevation, leaving roc k above the water table in an unsaturated state. In spite of the lack of saturated conditions in the upper backfill, groundwater Se concentrations in monitoring well GW7D have remained at or below the Idaho groundwater standard of 50 \u00b5g/L. (http://adm.idaho.gov/adminrules/rules/idapa58/0102.pdf ). Data from D ry Valley (Figure 2) show low concentrations of SeO 42-, NO 3-, and total dissolved iron (Fe) at consistent pH, with elevated concentrations of SO 42- and total dissolved manganese (Mn). Low concentrations of dissolved oxygen (O 2) were measured at this location (see Chapter 3). In contrast, groundwater samples collected from a monitoring well (GW11), completed in comparable mixed (run-of- mine) backfilled waste rock at J.R. Simplot Company's (J.R. Simplot) Smoky Canyon Mine, showed higher concentrations of SeO 42-, with measurable dissolved O 2, under variably saturated 4 Figure 2 . Monitored c hemistry in B panel backfill at Dry total Mn, total5 conditions. Efforts to explain the greater SeO 42- release from backfill monitored at Smoky Canyon, relative to that observed at Dry Valley, based solely on abiotic mechanisms were unsuccessful and led to the hypothesis that microbial reduction of SeO 42- to more reduced, less soluble SeO 32-, Se0, or Se2- minerals by indigenous organisms, using native carbon (C), may play an important role in controlling SeO 42- mobility in backfilled phosphate mine waste deposits. Improved understanding of how extensive and/or consistent this process might be within the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area , and whether mi crobial reduction of SeO 42- within backfills can be promoted to reduce impact on downgradient water resources, will benefit operational Se management strategies. Development of operational source control strategies that make effective use of microbial ecology to stabilize waste in situ by controlling the flux of water and O 2 to promote the formation of suboxic zones, through placement of key lithotypes to control texture and geochemistry, thereby influencing the potential for stabilization of solutes, has significant implications for sustainable mine waste management across a variety of mineral commodity sectors, well beyond Se contro l or phosphate production. Research Goals The research presented in this dissertation seeks to address the following questions: o Which, and how many, SeO 42--reducing microbes are present in phosphate mine waste? In groundwater from backfilled mine waste? o Which lithologies support native communities of SeO 42--reducing organisms ? 6 o What moisture, oxygen, and temperature con ditions support SeO 42- reduction by native organisms using naturally available C ? o How do moisture, oxygen, and temperature conditions affect the microbial community diversity and capacity for SeO 42- reduction? o How fast does SeO 42- reduction proceed under saturated anaerobic conditions in mine waste ? What variables control the rate of Se reduction in situ ? o What concentration and species of Se, C, N, S, Fe, Mn, as well as microbial community changes, are observed during SeO 42- reduction? o What are the end products of SeO 42- reduction? o Can indigenous microbes, using native C, reliably support operational source control of Se in mine waste? Scope of Investigation This document begins with a review of relevant literature (Chapter 2), in the context of a conceptual model for addressing the questions listed above. This is f ollowed by a description in Chapter 3 of the sites and historical data available describing the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area. The sampling and analysis of groundwat er and waste rock from sonic drill holes and monitoring wells is also reviewed in Chapter 3, supported by in situ measurement of O2, carbon dioxide, moisture content, temperature, and geochemistry [15]. These samples were collected from three mine sites : Agrium's Dry Valley Mine, J.R. Simplot's Smoky Canyon Mine, and Monsanto Company 's (Monsanto) Enoch Valley Mine (Figure 1), and were studied to: 1. Identify and enumerate SeO 42-- reducing microbes, using (a) cultivation - dependent methods and (b) molecular methods of identification using the (c) most probable number method (Chapter 4) 7 2. Evaluate environmental factors , including lithology, O 2, temperature, and moisture content, that influence the chemistry, extent and rate of microbial SeO 42- reduction (Chapter 5). 3. Review environmental conditions needed for conceptual design of operational mine facilities to promote SeO 42- reduction (Chapter 6) and identify questions to be addressed in future work. 8 References 1.

Idaho Phosphate Resource Area has important environmental and economic consequences. Selenium has a low crustal abundance of 0.05 mg/kg and is measured in low (1 -5 \u00b5g/L) concentrations in natural water except in association with Se-rich soils or rock [ 1]. It is readily bio-accumulated from water and sediment via synthesis of organic- Se compounds, including selenocysteine, the 21st amino acid [2, 3]. Selenium is required in amino acid s and proteins used in mammals for intracellular signaling, redox homeostasis, and thyroid metabolism [ 4], as well as production of antioxidant enzymes [ 5]. Selenium is also potentially toxic, at levels of exposure that vary between receptor organisms [ 6, 7] and are strongly affected by Se speciation [8, 9]. Selenate (SeO 42-) is less toxic reduced biselenite ( HSeO 3-) and selenite (SeO 32-) form s, and many organisms methylate Se to further reduce its toxicity. Selenium is therefore known as an \"essential toxin,\" due to the small difference between necessary and toxic concentrations in mammals , and diseases related to both Se-deficiency and acute or chronic Se-exposure are known [ 1]. One disease related to Se- deficiency is Keshan disease, a lethal form of cardiomyopathy named for the province in China where soils depleted in Se led to thousands of deaths until the need for supplementation was recognized [ 10]. Conversely, exposure to elevated concentrations of Se from industrial activities or leaching of naturally elevated Se from soils is known to produce a range of toxicosis symptoms 11 including gastrointestinal disorders, loss of hair and nails, fatigue, irritability and neurological damage [ 1]. The ecotoxicology of Se varies significantly between organisms, in part due to differences in detoxification mechanisms [ 9]. Reduction of soluble and toxic SeO 42- to SeO 32- /HSeO 3- or insoluble elemental selenium (Se0) and compounds significantly reduces Se mobility and bioavailability . While this reduction does occur abiotically, it is slow, especially in the conversion of SeO 42- to SeO 32-. This reduction is thus most readily accomplished by a variety of heterotrophic organisms that couple the reduction of Se with the oxidation of a broad spectrum of carbon (C) sources . Much attention has been focused on the study of microbial reduction of Se in promotion of bioremediation strategies for impacted water and sediment, with considerable focus on agriculture- affected settings like the Kesterson Reservoir , California [ 11]. These processes have also been incorporated into a variety of passive and active water treatment systems that rely on significant C and nutrient amendment [12]. Volatilization of Se 2- and phytoremediation have also received considerable attention, and some believe that these methods offer superior remediation capacity as gaseous Se mixes into the atmosphere and does not have potential for reoxidation in sedimentary or aqueous environments [ 11, 13 ]. The potential influence of volatilization on mass transfer and sequestration within subsurface phosphate overburden backfill deposits is likely to be relatively low, however. Use of microbial Se reduction in subsurface biobarriers designed for groundwater remediation has also been suggested in recent investigations [14, 15]. The focus of the present research was an evaluation of options for design of backfilled facilities that promote solid phase biomineralization, but 12 concurrent production of organic and volatile forms of Se in relation to biomineralization processes have also been considered. Se Biogeochemistry at the Facility Scale Integration of the hydrogeo chemical and biological processes that together influence the mobility of Se within weathering mine waste requires a conceptual understanding of their influence on Se speciation at both the field (\"mine facility \") and the micro (\" pore\") scales, as shown in Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 illustrates a phosphate mine pit where mineable phosphorite deposits are exposed in the upper and lower portions of the Meade Peak Member of the Phosphoria Formation . The mine pit is partially backfilled with mixed (\" run-of-mine\") waste rock (Figure 3) and extends below the groundwater table at this location. An arrow is drawn through the mixed backfill to illustrate infiltration of precipitation through the unsaturated rock, with flow towards saturated rock below the groundwater table (Figure 3). Changes in oxygen (O 2) concentration and moisture content are anticipated along this flow path, under the influence of changing lithology, particle size, compaction, and O 2 demand within the facility, resulting in transition from oxidizing and atmospheric to reduced , subsurface conditions. A constructed lift (bench) of mined waste rock is shown in Figure 3 as a conceptual reactive barrier designed to promote the reduction of the most oxidized form Se (VI) which occurs as SeO 42- , to less soluble Se (IV), Se(0) and or Se( II) forms . The facility scale conceptual model thus considers hydrologic, geologic and 13 geochemical conditions relevant to subsurface Se reduction within a backfilled phosphate mine pit. Figure 3. Facility scale conceptual model showing a mined section of the Phosphoria Formation in the S .E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area in a partially backfilled panel. Geologic section indicates upper and lower phosphorite ore zones with chert, mud, and shale waste rock lithotypes. Lifts of m ixed run-of- mine backfill are contrasted with a conceptual biobarrier placed to promote Se reduction within the groundwater flowpath in the middle of the mined panel. Sorted, end- dumped waste rock in foreground. Phosphate is mined from the Meade Peak Member of the Permian Phosphoria Formation in the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area, within a se ction of reduced, fine - grained and organic- rich clastic shale and carbonate sediments [16]. This stratigraphy is illustrated in the column included in Fi gure 3 . These sediments were deposited at the margin of a biologically productive, isolated marine basin, where O 2-depleted, denitrifying conditions allowed preservation of the organic C and phosphorous deposits [17, 18]. Elevated concentrations of biogenic copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), Se , cadmium (Cd), 14 and molybdenum (Mo) , relative to mean crustal abundance, occur in the shale and mudstone of the Meade Peak member [19] and are mobilized to varying degrees when mined rock weathers under oxidizing surf ace conditions [ 20]. The Meade Peak shale is comprised (albite/orthoclase/buddingtonite), and much as 5% total sulfide) [21]. Trace element, carbonate, and organic C content of the shale varies depending upon weathering history, with loss of carbonate and organic C, and changes in trace element ratios associated with near -surface alteration by meteoric water over geologic time [17]. Selenium content of the shale ranges from 1 to 1040 mg/kg and averages 65 mg/kg; it occurs as Se0 or substituted for S in the sulfide host- rock minerals pyrite (FeS The mineral dzarkenite, FeSe 2, has also been identified as a Se -bearing mineral in the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area mine waste [23]. Se lenium has als o been shown to occur as organo- Se compounds [ 22, 23] and as sorbed SeO 32- complexes on mineral surfaces [23] in weathered portions of the geologic section [ 24]. Iron oxides occur locally in more oxidized and altered sediments, but no green rust has been report ed [17, 22 ]. Phosphatic sediments are exposed within the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area along major north-northwest trending fold structures within the Meade Peak overthrust regional structure [ 16, 17, 25-27]. Waste rock is m ined principally from the overlying Rex chert member, the Meade Peak shale member known locally as the \"center waste shale\" between the upper and lower phosphorite zones, and mudstone mined from the upper and lower contacts of the Meade Peak with the overl ying Rex chert (Figure 3) . 15 Locally, the underlying limestone/dolomites of the Wells an d Park Formations are also mined (not shown). Mined chert overburden is randomly placed as backfill into mined - out pits with shale and lesser amounts of mudstone. Mixed o verburden deposits of black shale, brown mud, and tan chert are stacked in backfill lift deposits at the back of the panel, immediately to the left of the infiltration arrow in Figure 3 . The mixed \"run-of- mine \" composition is approximately 35% chert, 55% s hale, and 10% mudstone, which varies locally based on deposit geometry and mining practices . Together, the phosphate overburden lithologies create an alkaline geochemical setting that hosts Ca- HCO 3-SO 4 type groundwater with elevated concentrations of nitrate ( NO 3-) and variable amounts of dissolved organic carbon (see Chapter 3) . Leaching rates determined in field and laboratory studies of these mixed waste rock deposits indicate values consistent with the oxidation of Se0 reported elsewhere, with init ially high concentrations that decline to low, steady state levels [28]. Rock is generally placed randomly into backfilled mine pits, without selective handling, compacting, or control of influent water until closure. In some locations, backfill is built in lifts (e.g., benches from the bottom up) and is compacted by haul traffic ; in other places, revegetated moisture store- and-release covers are placed as dump s are constructed . Alternative ly, waste rock material can be end -dumped along steep embankments over vertical distances of more than 100 feet, where it falls in loose blankets of rock with pronounced sorting as a function of down slope distance [ 29]. The coarsest rock accumulates at the dump toe, creating zones with greater capacity for air flow. Precipitation infiltrating through the waste rock also transports O 2 into the waste 16 rock, promoting oxidation of minerals that host Se as a trace element ; heat rising within the interior of the dump pulls O 2 into the dump through the coarser toe deposits. Under these conditions, r educed forms of Se are oxidized to the mobile form, SeO 42-, which persists in alkaline groundwater. Mined rock typically has a low moisture content of 2 to 4% (weight ) water, so that unsaturated conditions within waste backfills are expected to dominate when waste rock is first deposited. Local zones of preferential flow with higher moisture contents are common within fine- grained and compacted material in mine waste, h owever, and overall moisture content is expected to increase (over tens to hundreds of years, depending upon water management strategies, climate conditions and sediment storage capacity) until unsaturated flow begins. Some backfill deposits in the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area are located within panels that extend below the local groundwater table, while others confine water within perched aquifers in fine- grained sediments above the regional groundwater table. Air t emperature ranges from seasonal hig hs of 30\u00b0C to below freezing, with subsurface temperatures ranging from 8 to 12\u00b0C at depths of up to 300 feet. [29]. It is plausible, based on observed conditions within existing backfills which support SeO 42- reduction, that conditions equally supportive of in situ Se stabilization could be intentionally developed on an operational basis within constructed reactive biobarriers . These passive react ive barrie rs would rely on materials and organisms already present within the backfilled mine waste, with a goal of reducing soluble (and toxic) SeO 42- to the more strongly sorbed SeO 32-/HSeO 3- forms (at neutral pH) or 17 insoluble Se0 and Se2-minerals . The potential for bioremediation of organic and metal compounds is well established [ 30], particularly for Se, and a variety of approaches have been taken to create suitable conditions to promote biological immobilization of contaminants within reactive barriers [31, 32]. Passive reactive barriers have been used to remediate groundwater in a variety of settings, including groundwater with excess NO 3- [33], SeO 42- [34], and SeO 32- [15]. To determine the residence time required for contaminant reduction, and the mass of C required, it is necessary to understand the biogeochemical processes that operate within the barrier . This study examines Se transformation within subsurface overburden deposits in locations like the Dry Valley , Smoky Canyon, and Enoch Valley mines, where reduction is observed, as analogs for possible constructed biobarriers. Se Biogeochemistry at the Micro -Scale A conceptual model for Se release and attenuation at the pore scale, where the microbial and abiotic geochemical processes that control mobility and bioavailability occur at the mineral surface, is shown in Figure 4 . Se speciation within the pore space is directly influenced by pH, temperature, presence of O 2 and carbon dioxide ( CO 2) gas, and biological activity within groundwater and biofilms developed on mineral surfaces. These micro -scale factors are controlled by macro -scale processes that must be descr ibed at the facility level . Based on the conditions described within the facility scale conceptual model, pH is expected to remain circumneutral , with temperature ranging between 10 and 25\u00b0C. Abiotic factors and biogenic processes likely to influence Se environmental geochemistry under these conditions are discussed below in the context of a conceptual 18 Pore Scale Conceptual Model and anaerobic microorganisms Run-of-Mine Rockmicroscale model. Figure 4 . Conceptual model of Se reduction by mixed microbial consortia in groundwater and biofilm developed on mineral surfaces within the pore environment, as influenced by C and O2 availability , CO 2 production, and moisture content. Se Geochemistry Selenium is a chalcogen an d is classified as a metalloid [11]. It has four stable oxidation states under ambient conditions, Se (VI), Se(IV), Se(0), and Se (-II) [35] and has six natural stable isotopes, dominated by 78Se and 80Se [36]. As shown in Figure 5, these redox states occur in multiple chemical forms, for simplicity, the chemical forms, rather than the general redox states, are used in this document. Selenium chemical behavior is similar to that of sulfur (S), for which it substitutes in both mine ral and organic 19 compounds [ 37], and that of arsenic ( As), with which it shares similar valence structures , atomic radii, and tendency to form negatively charged oxyanions in solution [ 5]. Figure 5. Simplified biochemical Se cycle with a) dissimilatory reduction , b) assimilatory reduction, c) alkylation, d) dealkylation, oxidation, f) bioinduced precipitation and g) disproportionation, after [4]. Insert table summari zes chemical compounds by oxidation state, after [1]. Selenium occurs as a common trace element in sulfidic coal, shale, and volcanic deposits, and its release is associated with agricultural, mining, and coal combustion activities [4, 38]. Oxidation and dissolution of seleniferous S 2- and SO 42- minerals, as well as organo -Se compounds, releases mobile and potentially toxic forms of Se that may threaten down- gradient water quality and biological resources . 20 The stability of inorganic Se compounds under changing redox and pH conditions are shown at 1 atm pressure and T=25\u00b0C for the system Se -Fe-Ca-H2O in Figure 6 . Selenium occur s in its most oxidized forms in natural water as the oxyanions SeO 42-, SeO 32-, or HSeO 3-, whereas more reduced elemental selenium ( Se0) and metal Se2- minerals are relatively insoluble and slow to re -oxidize [ 32, 39, 40 ]. Under the neutral to slightly alkaline pH conditions observed in the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area, which were measured in situ between 6.5 to 7.8 (Table 4), dissolved Se (IV) may be present as either SeO 32- or HSeO 3-. Figure 6. Eh- pH diagram for the system Se -Fe-Ca-H2O, T= 25\u00b0C, p = 1 atm from [ 32]. Elemental Se has a large stability field under moderately reducing conditions that extends across a wide range of pH conditions in natural water. Above pH 8, where soluble calcium is available, a hydrated calcium selenite mineral is stable, as shown in 21 Figure 6 . Other metal selenite minerals, such as mandarinoite (Fe 2Se3O9 6H 2O), can also occur under oxidizing and metal-rich conditions, but are quite rare in the natural environment. Metal selenide minerals, in addition to the FeSe phase shown in Figure 6 , such as penroseite (NiSe 2), also occur [ 23]. There is thus limited solubility control of SeO 42-, SeO 32-, and HSeO 3- under neutral to alkaline and oxidizing conditions in natural environments. Selenium speciation along multiple biotic and abiotic pathways can result in the co -existence of different Se species in any given environment. A simplified speciation map is show n in Figure 5 after [4] , which illustrates the various biogeochemical pathways involved in Se transformation coupled with a table summarizing the common chemical forms of Se at each oxidation state . In the following section, biogeochemical pathways methylated Se compounds; and re-oxidation of reduced Se are described. The potential influence of Se sorption; iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) biogeochemical cycling; and the organic C speciation and content of the Meade Peak shale are also discussed. Selenate Reduction Abiotic reductio n of SeO 42- to SeO 32-/HSeO 3- occurs very slowly within circumneutral pH and sub -surface temperatu res, creating a kinetic barrier to abiotic reduct ion [41]. This is explained by a one electron reduction potential barrier imposed by an intermediate Se (V) valence state [42]. Because of this kinetic barrier, most reduction of SeO 42- to SeO 32- is thought to be biologically mediated [4, 11, 43-48]. 22 Selenate reduction by green rust, an Fe2+/Fe3+ hydroxysulfate that occurs in suboxic sediments, is the best known abiotic mechanism of SeO 42- reduction [49]. The use of nanoparticle suspensions of zerovalent Fe to reduce SeO 42- to Se2- compounds has also been reported [50]. Many SeO 42--transforming microbes are strict anaerobes, but others are able to tolerate limited O2 exposure. The important influence of O 2 on microbial reduction of Se oxyanions has been identified in numerous studies [ 51, 52]. Although most Se reduction occurs under anaerobic or microaerophilic conditions, both obligate and facultative anaerobes are capable of Se reduction [ 44]. Growth is observed using a variety of electron donors, ranging from acetate and lactate to aromatic compounds [ 53]. Selenate reduction to Se0 is energetically favorable, yielding 71 kcal per mole SeO 42- reduced , when calculated using hydrogen as electron donor at standard state [ 4]. This yield is less than the energy produced by the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ (-114 kcal), Mn4+ to to N 2 (-112 kcal), but greater than that obtained through arsenate reduction (- 45 kcal) or SO 42-to S2- [4]. Biological Selenate Reduction : Anaerobic dissimilatory reduction 42- is accomplished by obligate or facultative anaerobes, using one of several specific SeO 42- reductase enzymes [54, 55]. Reduction of SeO 42- for detoxification purposes appears to occur using a specific SeO 42- reductase in Enterobacter cloacae SLD1a1 [56], but otherwise is reported to involve non- substrate specific enzymes associated with NO 3- and nitrite (NO 2-) [46, 57, 58] or SO 42- reduction [ 59, 60]. 23 Much of the research addressing SeO 42- reduction mechanisms has focused on characterization of the expression of SeO 42- reductase enzymes and potential inhibition of non-specific SeO 42- reduction by NO 3- and NO 2- reductase enzymes under denitrifying conditions [ 61-64]. Althou gh the first reports of SeO 42- reduction associated the process with SO 42- reduction [ 43], the energy yield of the SeO 42- to SeO 3- and SeO 42- to Se0 couples is closer to that of denitrification . Selenium is thus typically reduced and removed from a microaerophilic environmental system (or a water treatment process) well before the anoxic conditions that support SO 42--reduction develop. Nevertheless, SO 42--reducing bacteria can reduce Se, although some mutual inhibition is reported. In this study, both SeO 42- and SeO 32- were shown to be removed from SO 42--rich media by a biofilm- selected strain of Desulfomicrobium , with variation in end products controlled by the concentration of SO 42-. Under low SO 42- growth conditions, S2- was formed, while Se0 was formed under excess SO 42- conditions. The SeO 42- was reduced under SO 42--reducing conditions by an unspecified reductase [ 65], while the SeO 32- was reduced through abiotic reaction with HS- produced through SO 42- reduction [ 59]. Lenz showe d that SeO 42- reduction to Se0 was possible in a SO 42--reducing bioreactor, with the extent of SO 42-reduction dependent on the SeO 42- to SO 42- ratio, suggesting inhibition of an unspecified common enzyme [ 66]. Because SO 42--reducing conditions are likely to be less important in the microaerophilic backfills of the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area, the potential role of SO 42--reducing organisms is not emphasized here. Selenate Reductase Enzymes : The first identified Se of the DMSO molybdoenzyme family Nar clade, whi ch chlorate, perchlorate, dimethylsulfide, and dehydrogenase reductase enzymes. Synthesis of Ser (which only reduces SeO 42- to SeO 32-) is regulated by T. selenatis in response to anaerobic conditions and the presence of elevated SeO 42-concentrations [ 67]. The SeO 42- reductase isolated from T. selenatis consists of 3 subunits, s erA (96 kDa), s erB (40 kDa) and s erC (23 kDa), with a molecular weight of 1 59 kDa. The K m for SeO 42- is 16 \u00b5M and Vmax is 40 \u00b5mol SeO 42- reduced/min for each mg of protein. Cofactor constituents include Mo , Fe, acid labile S, and a cytochrome b [ 54]. Santini and Stolz [ 67] proposed an electron transport chain for the reduction of SeO 42- to SeO 32-, involving donation of electrons by the periplasmic cytochrome b to SerC , following receipt of electrons from a membrane- bound cytochrome -bc1 complex or from mobile electron carriers such as quinol. Different reductase characteristics have been described for Sulfurospirillum barnesii , wherein the SeO 42- reductase is membrane bound and much broader in terms of specificity [41, 68], but characterization of this reductase is incomplete. It appears that unique reduction mechanisms result in different biomineralization locations within cells, with Se0 reported within cytoplasm, periplasm, or as extracellular deposits depending on the organism. Another well characterized SeO 42- reductase has been described in E. cloacae SLD1a1 . Like that of T. , heme, and non- heme Fe subunits, but it differs in that it is an insoluble membrane bound protein th at relies on the global fumarate and nitrate reductase ( fnr) regulatory system, as well as the tatABC membrane translocation pathway genes, and the menaquinone biosynethic pathway genes 25 menFDHBCE [69]. The fnr regulon controls gene expression in some facultative anaerobic bacteria, allowing them to up -regulat e genes controlling the reduction of fumarate, NO 3-, and other electron acceptor s in response to declining O 2 concentrations [70]. A reductase with much broader specificity has been described for S. barnesii , [41, 68], and still another has been described for Bacillus selenatarsenatis SF1 [ 71]. Recent work by Butler and others addresses the influence of different Se reduction pathways and reductase enzymes on biomineralization end-products and has shown that T. selenatis and E. cloacae SLD1a -1, which have p eriplasmic membrane-bound reductases, respectively, produce different reduced Se0 mineral following unique SeO 32- reduction pathways [ 72]. Selenate Reduction to Selenite/Biselenite : Most known SeO 42--reducing microbes are Bacteria , although Archaea and Eukarya are known to reduce SeO 42- as well [4]. Selenate-reducing microorganisms have been identified within the Crenarchaeota, low and high G+C gram positive bacteria, and much of the Proteobacteria [67, 73]. Metabolically and taxonomically diverse communities class aquatic sediments from four freshwater environments [ 44]. Selenate Reduction to Elemental Se : Bacteria known to accomplish anaerobic dissimilatory SeO 42-reduction to Se0 (Figure 5 , also shown to reduce SeO 42- to Se0, although it is not clear whether this was a dissimilatory or a detoxification process [77]. The same is true of several members of the genus Dechloromonas [ 78, 79]. Some bacteria such as S. barnesii can reduce SeO 42- to Se0 while others like T. selenatis and E. homaechei can only reduce SeO 42- to SeO 32-. Thus, achieving the precipitation of an insoluble Se0 or Se2- mineral can require the participation of multiple member s of the microbial community. In some environmental settings, NO 3- and SO 42- were shown to inhibit SeO 42- reduction to Se0 [48], perhaps due to inhibition of SeO 32- reduction by non- Se-specific reductase enzymes with greater specificity for NO 3- or SO 42-. However, this is not true in all settings ; and NO 3- has been shown to be consumed concurrently with SeO 42- reduction in mixed community microcosms. It appears that unique SeO 32- reduction mechanisms result from specific SeO 42-reductase enzyme expression and regulation, which yield characteristic localization of biomineralization, with Se0 precipitates reported in cytoplasm, periplasm or extracellular deposits for different organisms [ 72]. The mechanism and location of SeO 42- reduction thus influences potential biogeochemical pathways for subsequent SeO 32- reduction. Selenate Detoxification : Bacterial species that have been shown to reduce SeO 42- for detoxification purposes (e.g., non-growth dependent of both SeO 42- and 27 SeO 32-oxyanions has also been reported for ated drainage sediment did not grow on Se oxyanions, SO 42-, or NO 3-, but was able to reduce SeO 42- to Se0 under microaerophilic conditions upon reaching stationary phase; it also produced volatile Se2- compounds [ 52]. The molecular mechanisms of SeO 42- detoxification are different from dissimilatory mechanisms . An earlier proposed detoxification mechanism involves maintena nce of redox poise through removal of excess electrons by a membrane-bound metal reductase [41]. A more recent study of detoxification in E. cloacae [56, 87, 88] identified facultative regulation of SeO 42- reduction by the global anaerobic regulatory gene fnr, which limits the expression of the SeO 42- reductase enzyme to low O2 conditions. Selenate reduction in cloacae is catalyzed by unique Mo -dependent, cytoplasmic membrane -bound (periplasm- facing) enzyme that is distinct from the Ser reductase as well as the NO 3- reductase [89]. This reductase could only sustain very slow growth on SeO 42- under NO 3--limited conditions [64]. Selenite Reduction Although SeO 32- and H SeO 3- are less mobile than SeO 42-, because of a higher tendency to sorb to mineral surfaces under neutral pH conditions, they are more toxic and can bioaccumulate more readily . Review of available literature suggests that f actors influencing the SeO 32- reduction biogeochemical pathway s directly influence the ultimate stabilization of Se within mined by-products and thus have obvious bearing on its mobility and toxicity . Potential mineralization end points include formation of sorbed 28 complexes on mineral surfaces, precipitation of Se0 or Se2- as minerals, or volatilization of methylated compounds. Selenite reduction ( Figure 5 , reaction pathway a) is much less kinetically constrained than SeO 42- reduction. Abiotic reduction of Se(IV) to Se (0) and /or Se (-II) thus occurs far more readily than Se (VI) reduction, through redox reaction s with Fe2+-containing minerals in mixed Fe2+/Fe3+ hydroxysulfate green rust [49], freshly Fe oxide [ 90], siderite [91], and complexed [94]. Aqueous Se2- have been undergo abiotic redox reactions with sulfide minerals [95, 96], resulting in the reductive formation of either Se0 or FeSe x depending on the oxidation state of the precursor sulfide mineral [97]. Selenite was also shown to co- precipitate with biogen ic sulfide within a SO 42--reducing biofilm [ 59]. Mechanisms 32- to Se0, and selenide minerals and methylated forms is also common [51,82, 98 ], in spite of the fact that the reduction of SeO 32- is not kinetically constrained . Selenite reduction to Se0 is energetically less favorable than SeO 42- reduction (-65 kcal/mol, [ 4]) but offers greater potential energy yield than is offered by SO 42- reduction [ 41]. No SeO 32--specific reductase has been report ed. The mechanisms of biological SeO 32- reduction appear to be more diverse, involving a variety of reductase enzymes capable of transforming elements including NO 3-, NO 2-, tellurite, sulfite and SO 42-. Specific possibilities include the periplasmic NO 2- reductase or hydrogenase I [52] and the glutathione reductas e [99]. 29 A recent study in E. coli showed that SeO 32- reduction was accelerated by several natural and synthetic quinone compounds that enhance electron transfer in promoting Se reduction both inside and outside microbial cells [ 100]. Another recent study showed that members of the genera Enterobacter , Bacillus and Delftia had a strong physiological capacity to adapt to high concentrations of SeO 32- under both aerobic and anaerobic exposure conditions, with resulting changes in cell morphology, fatty acid composition, and intracellular precipitation of Se 0 [101]. Selenite Respir ing Microbes : Bacterial species known to has a unique capacity to accumulate both SeO 42- and SeO 32-, but has only been shown to reduce SeO 32-, to Se0 [107] and selenomethionine [ 102, 108]. In 2010, the complete genome for C. metallidurans CH34 was reported. It is a model organism for bioremediation with a capacity to withstand millimolar concentrations of over 20 different heavy metal ions, including Se and Cd [ 109]. Selenite D etoxification : Non- respiratory SeO 32- reduction has been describ ed for bacterial can and reduce SeO 32-. 30 Elemental Se and Selenide Precipitation Precipitation of Se0 result s from the reduction of either SeO 42- or SeO 32-/HSeO 3- (Figure 5). Selenide can be formed via reduction of either SeO 32-/HSeO 3- or Se0 as reported for B. selenitireducens by Herbel et al. [103], or through biological transformation of alkylated Se (see Figure 5 , reaction pathways a and d). Both Se0 and Se2- minerals are relatively insoluble and readily precipitate as solid phases . Crystalline Se0 has a reddish grey color, while biogenic Se0 has a unique salmon red color and often occurs as framboids or nanospheres [ 76]. Selenide reacts with metal form insoluble metal complexes ( Figure 5 , reaction pathway f), s uch as the mineral isomorphs dz arkenite/ferriselite (FeSe 2), or the mineral clausthalite (PbSe). Pearce et al . described the formation of Se0 and Se2- minerals as a result of the microbial oxyanion reduction of SeO 32- [113]. Organo -Se Compounds The assimilation of Se in proteins, and formation of methylated Se compounds, may also influence Se cycling and the formation of stable Se compounds within the phosphate backfill environments in the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area. Microbial assimilatio n of Se in organic compounds such as selenocysteine ( Figure 5 , reaction pathway b) may occur in algal biomass- enriched zones. During assimilation into cells , both SeO 42- and SeO 32- can be transported across cell membranes via the SO 42- ABC transporter using permease enzymes, but there is evidence for multiple uptake systems for the more toxic SeO 32- compound [ 5, 11]. Selenium is incorporated into proteins in a manner that is analogous to that observed for S, but it has several unique properties that 31 result in the production of selenols (as opposed to thiols) and mixed thiol- selenol compounds [ 114]. Selenium can also be converted into volatile organic compounds, such as dimethylselenide and selenomethionine, by microbes along alkylation pathways as shown in Figure 5 , reaction pathway c [ 11, 13, 115, 116]. Alkylation, the linking of alkyl groups including methyl compounds to Se, is reported to involve reaction of inorganic SeO 32-with S -adenosylmethionine (SAM), forming a series of reaction products including dimethyldiselenide, dimethylselenone, dimethylselenide, and trimethylselenonium [8]. This process increases the volatility of Se compounds and improves membrane transport and therefore microbial excretion . This process also decreases toxicity, but the increased membrane permeability raises potential for environmental accumulation by some species [117]. Methylation is a common detoxification mechanism [11] and both Se(0) and Se(IV) compounds can be methylated. Recent work by Ranjard et al . [118, 119] has identified a bacterial thiopurinemethyltransferase involved in Se biomethyla tion in freshwater environments. Rapid microalgal metabolism of SeO 42- to volatile dimethylselenide in freshwater [120] and production of volatile DMSe and DMDSe species by the microfung us Alternatia alternata has been described [121]. Seleno -L-methionine was identified as the dominant organo- Se compound produced by the bacterial strain C. metallidurans CH34 upon exposure to SeO 42- or SeO 32- [108]. The majority of gaseous Se compounds that are stable under the neutral pH conditions typical of phosphate backfill environments are likely to be methylated compounds, since H 2Se gas is only stable under strongly acidic and reducing conditions (Fig ure 3). Under certain 32 conditions, volatilization of Se may contribute to a decrease in soluble and bioavailable Se within mine waste facilities. Several fungi and B acteria are known to contribute to methylation and volatilization under dominantly aerobic and unsaturated conditions (18 to 70% of saturated water content) when sufficient C is provided and where NO 3- and heavy metal concentrations are low [8, 11]. Bacterial genera with members capable of producing methylated Se compounds include some members of the Aeromonas, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Rhodocyclus. Dealkylation ( pathway d) by methylotrophic and methanotrophic organisms has also been reported in [11]. Oxidation Reduced Se2- hosted in and organo-Se compounds is initially released by oxidation of mined materials . The potential for the reoxidation of reduced and immobile Se compounds is also important to predictions of the long- term effectiveness of in situ microbial reduction as a method of source control. Reduced Se often occurs as Se2- substituted in sulfide minerals [122], but also as Se0 and discr ete Se2- mineral phases. Selenium release associated with weathering of mine waste in the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area is thus commonly due to oxidation of pyrite and other sulfide minerals [123]. As a result, the release of Se follows comparable oxidation pathways to those described for sulfide oxidation, both abiotic and biotic. Under abiotic conditions, O 2 is the most powerful oxidant, but Fe3+, Mn4+, and NO 3- all have the potential to serve as oxidants in its absence. Sulfide and selenide minerals are known to be oxidized ( Figure 5 , 33 reaction pathway e) by the sulfide oxidizing bacteria ferrooxidans [124] and Selenium the r educed oxidation states is slow to re-oxidize, although a range of rates are reported . Dowdle and Oremland reported rate constants for Se0 oxidation that were four orders of magnitude lower than those for dissimilatory SeO 42- reduction in organic-rich, anoxic sediments [ 39]. In that study, Se0 was oxidized mostly to SeO 32- with smaller quantities of SeO 42- produced in live soil microcosms where SeO 32- sorption limited further production of SeO 42-. However, Tokunaga reported rapid reoxidation of freshly precipitated nanoparticulate Se0 in ponded sediments when exposed to O Remobilization of almost half of colloidal biogenic Se0, which can remain suspended in aerated aquatic systems, has also been demonstrated [126]. Only one bacterial species , Bacillus megaterium , has been singled out in the literature for its capacity to oxidize Se0 to SeO 32- [127]. Selen ite is also reported to be slow to reoxidize abiotically in the presence of O2 at neutral or alkaline pH and requires stronger oxidation by ultra-viole t radiation or redox- active elements such as Fe3+ [38] or Mn oxides [ 128] under more acidic Adsorption of Se Species Adsorption is the dominant abiotic control of Se solubility at neutral pH . A few SeO 32- minerals are known , such as ferroselite, Fe2(OH) 4SeO 3, and CaSeO 3 x H 2O, as shown in Figure 6 . These minerals are rare, however, and there are no known insoluble SeO 42- minerals [1]. Although SeO 42- sorption is likely to be limited under the neutral to alkaline conditions observed in backfilled phosphate mine waste, SeO 32- sorption may be 34 an important attenuation mechanism if sufficient mineral substrate is available . Dissolved concentrations of SeO 42- and SeO 32-/HSeO 3- are controlled abiotically under oxidizing conditions through sorption to metal oxide s [129-133], apatite carbonate [ and clay [136-138] minerals of SeO 32-/HSeO 3- to Fe and Mn oxides, carbonate, apatite, and clay minerals is possible within the waste lithologies mined in the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area. Sorption of the oxyanionic species increases with the increased positive charge of protonated oxide and clay mineral surfaces under acid conditions. At neutral pH, SeO 42- adsorption is much less efficient than the more significant attenuation of SeO 32-/HSeO 3- under mildly reducing conditions. Maximum SeO 42- sorption requires a pH below 6. In one study, the midpoint of an adsorption isotherm for SeO 42- to hydrous ferric oxide ranged from pH 5.5 to 6.7 for total Se concentrations between 0.1 and 10 \u00b5mol /L; in contrast, the mid -point for SeO 32-sorption was reported between pH 8.8 and 9 for the same range in concentration [ 130]. Sorption of Se oxyanions has been described in coal mine environments [139] and modeling parameters have been developed for Se species within the constant capacitance [140] and triple layer models [141]. High concentrations of organic matter in soil also appear to limit the solubility and bioavailability of Se [10], although organic acids may compete for sorption sites on goethite [ 130]. Sulfate and NO 3- may also compete with Se oxyanions for sorption sites. Iron and Manganese Biogeochemistry Biogeochemical cycling of Fe and Mn by microorganisms potentially influences 35 Se mobility within the backfilled phosphate environments in the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area. Iron and Mn- cycling microorganisms may drive the mineralization of complex hydrocarbon compounds present in the Meade Peak sediments and/or alter the availability of oxidized Fe and Mn mineral substrate capable of sorbing SeO 32-/HSeO 3-. Iron has been shown to be important in abiotic Se sorption and preci pitation of ferroselite (FeSe 2) [142]. It has been suggested that additional Fe should be added to S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area waste to sta bilize Se as an Fe-selenide compound in waste deposits [ 143]. Because of the high concentration of Mn in the Meade Peak sediments, reduction of Mn oxides by Fe2+ (with subsequent cycling of both elements) may play an important role in this system [144]. Microbial oxidation of C coupled to Fe3+ reduction is thought to mineralize much of the reduced organic matter in sedimentary and aquatic environments [ 145, 146]. Organisms capable of this metabolism likely influence the bioavailability of native C to the indigenous consortia of B acteria that affect Se mobility in the Meade Peak sediments . They also influence the presence of reactive Fe2+ species in the environment. The importance of Fe and Mn cycling in hydrocarbon degradation has been the subject of numerous investigations [ 145, 147-151], which are discussed further below and in Chapter 4 . Of particular interest to the questions of i n situ Se reduction using complex bitumen -derived native C in blasted rock within subsurface deposits is the potential for anaerobic, NO 3--dependent Fe oxidation [ 152, 153 ]. The potential role of Fe2+/Fe3+ and Mn2+/Mn3+Mn4+ as electron shuttles is also interesting in context of SeO 32- and NO 3- reduction within the backfill [ 151, 154 ]. Given the neutral pH of the phosphate mine 36 waste, Fe and Mn are likely to form stable oxide minerals, unless reduced through biological activity . Dynamic cycling of Fe and Mn coupled to hydrocarbon reduction creates reducing potential for the subsurface backfill deposit system which balances the flux of oxidants. Belzile et al. [155] described a multi -scale chemical, biological , and physical process of Se attenuation . Reduced SeO 32- is sorbed onto Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides, which are dissolved through biotic reduction under progressively reducing conditions developed during diagenesis. Biotic Fe - and Mn-reducing organisms promote mineralization of organic matter, thus driving Se sequestration as Se 0, seleniferous pyrite, and selenide minerals [155]. Organic Geochemistry of the Meade Peak Shale The organic C content of the phosphate overburden lithologies varies considerably. The dark brown- to-black colored Meade Peak shale sediments are highly carbonaceous, containing up to 15% C by weight [26]. These sediments were source rocks for evolved hydrocarbon, which migrated out of the Meade Peak member during Jurassic time, leaving behind immature kerogen and bitumen residues that reflect a complex thermal maturation history [156, 157] . Extractable, naturally occurring Meade Peak hydrocarbons in composition, ranging from simple alkane and alkene compounds to monocyclic and poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Carbon species naturall y present within the Meade Peak s hale include toluene, benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and dibenzothiophene (Chapter 3). Conversely, the Rex c hert member is 37 variably argillaceous and oxidized with grey chert concretions in a locally iron- oxide- bearing matrix; it is much less carbonaceous and contains far fewer aromatic compounds (Chapter 3). Bioavailability of the C that occurs in the phosphate overburden is an important factor that will limit the extent of in situ Se reduction by native microbes. In other studies of organic- rich, metal -bearing shales, native Microbacteria spp. and Pseudomonas spp. have been shown to grow using primary C as the sole C and energy source [158]. Similarly, microbial growth on kerogen in shales has been documented [ 159, 160]. The ability of native organisms to grow using indigenous C is hypothesized to drive the reduction of Se and other metals in the S.E. Ida ho Phosphate Resource Area backfill s. In this backfill, application of NO 3-- and SeO 42--rich water appears to have triggered biological reduction of both, without addition of excess C or other modification (e.g., addition of Fe ). Based on this observation, C is believed to be bioavailable and present in excess at other subsurface locations where Meade Peak sediments are placed as backfill. Microbial Degradation of Complex Hydrocarbon Compounds The goal of this study is to evaluate the potential for native microorganisms to accomplish SeO 42- reduction as a control on aqueous Se concentrations in backfilled phosphate overburden without amendment, that is to say, relying strictly on the C compounds available in the rock itself. To that end, published li terature addressing aerobic and anaerobic subsurface degradation of complex hydrocarbons by bacteria was reviewed in developing a conceptual model for the investigation. There is an extensive 38 body of literature treating this subject, including several excellent reviews [144, 153, 161]. The i dentification of native monocyclic and poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons compounds in analyses of the shale and chert overburden (Chapter 3) , as well as identification of bacteria capable of degrading those compounds (Chapter 4), guided the following literature review. Key physical and chemical factors con trolling hydrocarbon degradation include: complexity of C compounds, dispersion or sorption of the hydrocarbon, concentration , temperature, availability of O2 and nutrients, activity of water , and pH [ 145]. Based o n the variable saturation and O2 content measured in the backfilled mine pits, it is likely that bacterial mineralization of aromatic hydrocarbons present in the Meade Peak shale proceeds under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions at neutral to slightly alkaline pH. Optimal rates of overall mineralization may reflect both aerobic and anaerobic processes, under conditions ranging from 30 to 90% water saturation [ 145]. It is likely that both NO 3- (from blasting) and primary phosphate are present in the overburden, and diesel fuel used in ammonium nitrate -fuel oil ( ANFO ) compounds for blasting purposes in the less carbonaceous chert may also be used as a C source. Hydrocarbon degradation in the mixed and blasted waste rock may be the result of microbial respiration using O 2, or anaerobic processes involving reduction of Fe3+, Mn4+, NO 3-, SeO 42-, SeO 32-, or SO 42- [30]. Degradation of organic C under Fe3+-, Mn4+-, and NO 3--reducing conditions is of particular interest in these transitional redox environments. Because SO 42- concentrations remain high in monitored, mine- affected water, SO 42- reduction does not seem to be an important process within the backfills . It is possible that these metabolisms occur within 39 backfill micro -habitats, due to local development of suboxic conditions as a result of abiotic and biotic consumption of O 2. A diverse group of microorganisms has been shown to be capable of anaerobic degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons [162]. A mixed benzene-degrading culture that used NO 3- as an electron acceptor has been described, which was comprised of several Bacteria including members of the genus Dechloromonas [ 163]. Degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons via aerobic pathways is energetically more than an order of magnitude more favorable than anaerobic processes [145], with comparable energy yields and denitrification (-72.2 kJ/e-) yield is particularly high for benzene and toluene degradation coupled to NO 3- or Fe3+ reduction [ 153]. Recen tly published studies of anaerobic degradation of benzene 165-169], toluene [ 170], naphthalene [ 164], and phenanthrene [ 171] suggests that these processes are more common than previously recognized. Anaerobic degradation of benzene likely involves hydroxylation, a lkylation, or carboxylation to form toluene, hydroxybenzoate, or subsequent alkylbenzene degradation via co -A pathways [172] under either SO 42-- or NO 3--reducing conditions [ 153]. Anaerobic benzene degradation was first reported under denitrifying conditions [ 168], by Dechloromonas aromatica. Bacteria having greater than 98% identity to D. aromatica have also been isolated from phosphate backfill at both the Smoky Canyon a nd Dry Valley mines , and shown, in this study, to reduce SeO 42-. Many subsurface bacteria s urvive using anaerobic or facultative metabolisms under low nutrient and temperature conditions and have low metabolic rates [ 173]. The 40 rates of mineralization for aromatic compounds are more directly influenced by hydrophobicity compared to rates of mineralization for the more soluble alkane compounds [ 145]. Denitrification plays an important role in the degradation of monocyclic aromatic benzene and toluene [153], and poly cyclic aromatic naphthalene and phenanthrene [ 173]. An in situ study of mixed microaerophilic and anaerobic microbial communities in benzene -contaminated groundwater [ 174] indicated the presence of phylotypes highly similar to members of the aerobic (or denitrifying) Pseudomonas, Polaromonas, suggesting biodegradation of benzene through paired aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. Anaerobic degradation of benzoate and hydroxybenzoate compounds under SeO 42--reducing conditions by diverse members of the G amma proteobacteria has been reported [ 53]. Conceptual Model of Phosphate Backfill Se Biogeochemistry Insight into biogechemical processes that influence Se cycling and mobility based on the preceding literature review allows definition of a conceptual biogeochemical model for in situ reduction of Se by native consortia using indigenous C within backfilled mine pit environments at both the mine facility and micro (pore ) scales (Figures 3 and 4) . Previous investigation has shown that lithology, C content, geochemistry (particularly, NO 3-, Fe, and Mn), and mineralogy of overburden will influence Se bio mineralization. Temperature, pH, Eh, and Se speciation clearly influence the biogeochemical transformation of Se. Availability of water influences biological productivity, O 2 availability, and both the release (e.g., vapor phase Se) and transport of Se (e.g., saturated 41 vs. unsaturated conditions). Oxygen availability is a particularly important factor influencing styles of microbial metabolism that affect both hydrocarbon degradation and Se speciation . These factors were evaluated through in situ monitoring of backfilled phosphate overburden, as described in Chapter 3, and used to identify experimental conditions for sample collection and storage, microbial isolation, and construction of microcosm reactors used in this study. 42 References 1.

To characterize and quantify these conditions in the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area, rock and groundwater was sampled and analyzed , together with in situ hydrogeochemical measurements of temperature, O2, and carbon dioxide ( CO 2), and moisture. Samples of rock and water, where possible, were collected at the Agrium Nu- West Dry Valley, J.R. Simplot Smoky Canyon, and Monsanto Enoch Valley mines (Figure 7). Members of the Idaho Mining Association (IMA) Phosphate Working Group have conducted several studies of overburden hydrogeology and Se geochemistry since 1996 [1]. Sampling and analysis of overburden, groundwater, and subsurface conditions in addition to the Tetra Tech/MFG, Inc. work was conducted for this study. This chapter begins with a brief description of backfill at the three mine sites, as well as a summary of previous work characterizing the hydrogeochemistry of Se in these locations [2]. These include overburden sampling and analyses in 2005; drilling, in 2006, and characterization of overburden geochemistry, reported in 2008, conducted in association with this study [2], in situ monitoring of backfill hydrogeochemistry, 2007-2010 [2, 3], and groundwater sampling, this study and previ ous related investigations [4, 5]. 59 Figure 7. Location of 3 s ampled d rill holes and 2 m onitoring wells in S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area. Depth to exposed lithologies and water in each hole are illustrated . Rock sample locations are indicated to the right of each drill hole at the corresponding sampled depth; the ID reflects the sampling location and rock type, e.g. MS5 represents M for Monsanto's Enoch Valley drillhole MEV, S for Shale, and 5 for 5 feet of depth. Likewise, SCA represents Smoky Canyon drillhole A and SCD represents Smoky Canyon drill hole D. Groundwater monitoring wells are numbered as shown, GW7D-2a (Dry Valley) and GW11 (Smoky Canyon). Technical reports cited above are publically available from the state of Idaho and/or federal land management agencies, including U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Bureau of Land Management. Some of the reports providing site descriptions cited above or discussed below are provided in Appendix A. Collectively, site conditions are summarized to define experimental design and material requirements for the biogeochemi stry experiments presented in Chapters 4 and 5. 60 Backfilled Mine Panels in S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area Phosphate ore is mined from regional, NNW-trending folds developed in the Phosphoria Formation within the Meade Peak overthrust. Mine pit ( a.k.a. panel) backfills at the Dry Valley, Smoky Canyon, and Enoch Valley mines have been constructed using randomly placed run-of-mine (ROM) waste rock mined from the Meade Peak and Rex chert members of the Phosphoria Formation. At Enoch Valley, more limestone was mined than at both the Dry Valley and Smoky Canyon mines, where more chert was removed . Changes in backfill construction methods, water management, cap construction, and proximity to the regional groundwater table further distinguish backfill conditions at each site . Collectively, these three mines provide an excellent overview of field conditions in S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area backfill. Agrium Dry Valley Mine The management history, geology, hydrology, aqueous chemistry, O 2 and CO 2 concentrations, and temperature of backfill at Dry Valley were described by Tetra Tech/Maxim [6]. The B pit backfill at Agrium's Dry Valley Mine was constructed through plug-dumping ( rather than end -dumping) by individual trucks on constructed lifts (benches) of fixed height, with random placement of shale, chert, mudstone, and limestone (in descending order of relative ton nage). The pit has a 165 acre footprint, extending nearly 9000 feet along strike and 800 feet across , as shown in Figure 8. Depth is approximately 200 feet below the local ground surface. Pit water was discharged seasonally in 2000 and 2001 into multiple p onds on the surface of the reclaimed B pit 61 Figure 8. Map of Dry Valley Mine showing backfilled pits A to D and groundwater monitoring wells GW7D, GW7D2a/2b. After Tetra Tech, 2007, [ 1] 62 backfill during mining of the adjacent C panel (Figure 8). This resulted in temporary saturation of the backfill with NO 3-- and SeO 42--rich water, followed by draining to field capacity within the upper backfill [6]. A perched zone of saturation exists low in the backfill , which lies above the regional groundwater table in the underlying limestone bedrock (approximately 60 feet below ground surface). The limestone between the saturated backfill and the groundwater is relatively dr y, reflecting the confined nature of the groundwater within the backfill. Results suggest that the methods of placement (e. g., constructed lifts rather than end dumping down long waste rock slopes) [2], as well as the temporary saturation of these materials [6] distinguish the physical hydrogeology and therefore the biogeochemistry of these backfills from other S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area backfills . The cross section shown in Figure 9 illustrates the monitoring wells installed at the Dry Valley Mine in 2003. Groundwater well GW 7D was completed in deep backfill at the northern end of reclaimed pit B at the Dry Valley Mine . This well has been monitored for compliance purposes since 1998 and is located within the footprint of historic pit dewatering discharge ponds. A second well was drilled, GW7D2, approximately 500 feet to the north of the GW7D well. T wo monitoring wells completed at the second location, one deep (GW7D2a, 180 feet, bottom of backfill) and one more shallow (GW7D2b, 140 f eet, the approximate groundwater elevation), have been sampled since Oc tober 2002. Water quality data from GW7D and GW7D2a/2b are provided in Appendix A1, Tables A1-1 and Tables A1-2. Near -surface gas vapor points and lysimeters at depths of 5, 10, 20 and 30 feet were also installed (Figure 9). Descriptions 63 Figure 9. Dry Valle y cross section showing monitoring installation, after [7]. 64 of the subsurface monitoring installations, and data collected from them are provided in the Agrium Groundwater Validation study [6], portions of which are also provided in Appendix A1. These data show higher concentrations of total dissolved Se in near - surface (<10 feet) l ysimeter samples (mean 0.22 mg/L, with values as high as 0.74 mg/L). Samples collected below a depth of 10 feet in backfill show O 2 depletion (concentration below detection limit (0.1 mg/L ), with CO 2 enrichment up to 7% CO 2. Of particular interest are the low soluble concentrations of Se in the two deep wells (GW7D and GW7D2a) at the Dry Valley Mine, which are below the Idaho groundwater standard of 0.05 mg/L. These low Se values correspond with the absence of detectable dissolved O 2 and O 2 gas within backfilled sediments above the water table [6]. J.R. Simplot Smoky Canyon Mine The hydrogeochemical conditions in backfill at the Smoky Canyon and Enoch Valley mines were described by Tetra Tech/MFG [2]. Three distinct portions of the overburden at the Smoky Canyon Mine have been incorporated into this study, which include the backfilled portions of panels A and D, and the external surface overburden dump located to the southeast of panel A (Figure 10). Most overburden at the Smoky Canyon Mine wa s placed by end-dumping mine wastes from individual trucks along angle of repose slopes from panel highwall benches (excavated benches that step back from the bottom of a pit or panel in order to create a stable slope on the margins of the pit) or from dump crests (the top of mine waste rock piles). Here, individual truckloads of overburden tend to be distributed along dump faces tens or hundreds of feet in length, where size fraction ation oc curs by sorting and materials are comingled more completely 65 Figure 10. Map of Smoky Canyon Mine showing 2006 drilling locations relative to backfilled panels (pits) A, D and E. 66 than would occur where individual trucks dump isolated plugs of material that is less well sorted (Dry Valley) . Coarser layers provide conduits for enhanced gas exchange, relative to fine grained layers [8] and also serve as capillary breaks, elevating the saturation and water storage within overlying finer grained zones [9 -11]. The D backfill panel extends over a footprint of 370 acres and contains approximately 64 million cubic yards of backfilled overburden. Depth is approximately 220 feet. It was constructed between 1993 and 1997, and the southern third of the facility was capped with chert, graded, and covered with topsoil for re-vegetation in 2004. The northern portion of the D panel was constructed and re- vegetated prior to initiation of chert capping as a best practice for Se management [2]. Panel A (and the associated, free standing external Panel A dump) were constructed beginning in 1984 and are significantly older than the D p anel backfills . Panel A backfill is approximately 100 feet thick and extends over a footprint of 120 acres. The Panel A external dump covers some 80 acres and contains 7 million cubic yards of mixed overburden. The external dump was re- graded and covered with topsoil that varies in thickness (3 inches to 3 feet ) prior to re -vegetation in 1996; it was not capped with inert rock [2]. The GW11 monitoring well at the Smoky Canyon Mine was completed in approximately 100 feet of b ackfill along the east side of the A panel, where it was collared (the point at which a well starts at the surface) in a maintenance area located adjacent to the main haul road where the grade was flat. Water pond ing in this unreclaimed area resulted in episodic recharge in response to changes in precipitation. 67 The elevation of ground water was thus variable in GW11 and intermittently dropped below the maximum depth of the well, so that it was not possible to consistently collect water from this well. The well was accessible from 2001 to 2009, after which it was decommissioned to allow for construction of another lift of overburden in that location. Water quality data from GW11 reported in 2002 are provided in Appendix A1, Table A1-3. A description of the groundwater sampling protocol used at GW11 is also provided in Appendix A1. Monsanto Enoch Valley Mine The mined pit at the Enoch Valley Mine was backfilled between 2000 and 2002, and reclaimed in 2003. Backfill placed in the lower portion of the facility was end dumped down angle of repose slope distances longer than 50 feet; the upper backfill was constructed with a combination of plug dumping and dozing (pushing of rock with equipment) thereby constructing discrete lifts or tiered benches. This location has a higher proportion of limestone in the backfill than other studied locations. Seleniferous waste materials were isolated within the center of the facility, which does not extend above the original topography. The surface was re -contoured and capped with 4 feet of limestone, and overlain by 18-24 inches of alluvium and chert as topsoil. The backfill lies approximately 128 feet above the regional groundwater table ; consequently, it was not possible to sample groundwater at the Enoch Va lley Mine (Randy Vranes, Monsanto, personal communication, 2007 and 2011). 68 Sampling and Analysis Methods Mined overburden and groundwater from backfilled panels were sampled at multiple time points . Methods used to obtain data and material s for experiments are described below . This study also relied on sampling and analysis conducted by others [4 - 6], as well as work that was conducted at the same time as this study [2, 3]. Overburden Sampling Program The majority of rock sampling was completed in March 2005 (Appendix A-2) and March 2006 (Appendix A-3). Initial sampling (2005) was limited to archived drill samples from the Dry Valley Mine (hole GW7D2) and near -surface exposures of bedrock and overburden at the Smoky Canyon Mine. Subsequent drilling (2006) at the Smoky Canyon and Enoch Valley mines provided greater access for subsurface sample collection . The method and timing was largely dictated by access to equipment and drilling schedules, and an effort was made to avoid the most difficult weather and road conditions. 2005 Overburden Sampling : A total of 58 samples of overburden were collected in 2005 at the Dry Valley and Smoky Canyon mines (Figure 7). Specifically, 34 rock samples were collected from an archived core of unconsolidated backfill from the Dry Valley Mine groundwater monitoring well GW7D2; g eochemical analyses were reported previously for select samples from this drill ed hole, as described in Table A2-1 [6]. An additional 24 samples were collected at the Smoky Canyon Mine by excavating portions of the unreclaimed D & E panel backfills, as shown in the photo log provided in 69 Appendix A-2. Overburden was exposed and sampled in several locations within the limits of safe excavation practice in unconsolidated material ( at a depth of 6 to 10 feet, depending upon topography). Multiple samples of each rock type were collected to represent the range of mineralogical, textural, and geochemical variation in backfilled pits . A sampling protocol is provided in Appendix A -2. Approximately 4 kilo grams (kg) of overburden were collected at each location; samples were air -dried and sieved. Due to formation of hard pan surface and aggregates during the air- drying process, samples were passed through a bench top soil flailer (Custom Laboratory Equipment, Orange City, FL ) at the MSU Plan t Growth Center prior to sieving. Particle gradation analyses were obtained using standard dry sieving methods (after ASTM C136, 2005) with 2 inch, 1 inch, and no. 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 200 mesh screens on a sieve shaker. The relative cla y and silt- sized fractions were calculated based on hydrometer measurements of the sub -200 mesh fraction for some of the samples . Results of the particle gradation analyses are provided as Table 2 -1 and Figures A2-1 and A2-2. Material was coned (mounded i nto a pile on a plastic sheet) and divided into quarter splits, and 100 g rams (g) of each individual sample was archived. Sub-1/4 inch material was composited for subsequent experimental use and analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC) (APHA Standard Method 5310) and total element content (aqua regia digestion followed by multi- element Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Mass Spectroscopy (MS)) for the shale and chert composites from both mines at ALS Chemex (Appendix A2). More detailed analysis of organic C speciation was completed for the 70 chert and shale composites from the Smoky Canyon Mine following EPA method 3350 with Gas Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (GCMS) by EPA method 8270C at Energy Labs in Billings, MT (Appendix A2). 2006 Drilling, Geochemistry and In Situ Monitoring Program : This study was conducted in parallel with a broader regional study of overburden geochemistry conducted throughout the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area by the I MA Phosphate Working Group and its contractors (Appendix A3, [2]). Subsurface samples were collected in 2006 using sonic drilling methods, with control of gas exposure and aseptic technique (see below) for additional lithological, textural, geochemical, moisture, and microbial community characterization. Specific objectives for Tetra T ech/MFG (contractor to the IMA Phosphate Working Group) included characterizing the O 2 content within overburden deposits; estimating availability of organic carbon (C) as substrate for microbial activity; characterizing total and leachable Se content of samples; producing an acid- base account for overburden waste; assessing grain size distributions; and sampli ng for microbiological testing (this study). Four holes, drilled at the Smoky Canyon Mine (Smoky Canyon A dump ( SCA ) and D dump ( SCD )), Enoch Valley Mine (Monsanto Enoch Valley ( MEV )), and Rasmussen Ridge Luxor Mine (LUX), were situated to intercept maximum thickness of randomly deposited mine waste in deposits with a range of ages, topographical aspect s, duration of weathering, and styles of construction/management. Due to limited resources, only three of these drill holes could be sampled for microbiological analyses; two backfill (SCD and MEV) and one external dump (SCA) locations were thus chosen for this microbial study. 71 A field sampling protocol was developed for this study in coordination with MFG to provide for rapid, in- field as eptic handling and sampling of all cores (Appendix A-3). Samples were collected and stored to preserve temperature, gas, moisture, and redox conditions to the extent possible. A total of 16 samples were collected for microbial community analysis based on depth and lithology following inspection under nitrogen (N2) gas at the drill site (see photos Appendix A-3). As samples were collected from the core barrel, they were placed into L exan \u00ae plastic bags , labeled and temperature was recorded . Heating of the core within the core barrel varied due to increased friction under rough drilling conditions. Only one sample was excluded from further evaluation based on a temperature that exceeded 37\u00b0C. Each interval was placed into the N 2-flooded and sanitized (10% bleach followed by 70% ethanol) glove box on sheets of fresh plastic. The sample bag was opened under N 2 gas and the lithology was described in hand specimen for mineralog y, moisture, and clastic content, followed by subsequent laboratory analyses by Tetra Tech/MFG [2]. Sampled intervals were chosen to represent the three principal lithologies (chert, mudstone, and shale) at different depths within both backfilled and external dump overburden facilities. To collect a sample for microbial analysis, the internal core was exposed and sub-sampled using sterilized utensils . These sub-samples were composited, split into several containers for mineralogical, microbial, molecular, and geochemical analysis, and preserved under sterile gas headspace conditions, using filtered air and N 2 gas to create oxic and anoxic conditions, respectively . Containers were sealed to conserve moisture and stored in the dark at temperatures at or below the measured average subsurface temperature of 10 \u00b0C. Samples 72 stored under aerobic conditions were aerated periodically under sterile conditions or maintained with a filtered port to allow for air exchange. Samples selected for microbial study from drill holes at the Smoky Canyon Mine backfilled panels D (SCD) and A (SCA), and the Enoch Valley Mine (MEV) were also submitted by Tetra Tech for analysis of TOC (ASA Method 9 29-2.2.4 combustion IR); leachable organic C (EPA SW-846 followed by method total Se analyses; leachable content (ASTM D2216); grain size (ASTM C136, 2005), and soil moisture retention [2]. The holes drilled by MFG were completed with 2- inch PVC well stem in a sand - packed annular space. Nine sections of high density nylon tubing extending to elevations proportional to 10% of the total depth for each hole were attached to the exterior of the PVC casing, for use in monitoring O 2 and CO 2 concentrations (see TetraTech 2008 report in Appendix A3 for completion details). Well stems were al so equipped with a single thermistor for in situ temperature measurement . Gas and temperature measurements were made in June and December 2006 , see [2] in Appendix A-3. Groundwater Monitoring and Sampling Groundwater was collected at both the Smoky Canyon and Dry Valley mines , for measurement of in situ parameters ( temperature , pH, Eh, Specific Conductivity (SC), and dissolved O 2) and geo chemistry (multiple parameters) . Native groundwater and live cultures were also collected for use in isolation, enrichment, and culturing studies. 73 Samples were collected periodically from the three wells (GW7D, GW7D2a, GW7D2b) at the Dry Valley Mine, to obtain live cultures, during site visits that oc curred between 2004 and 2008. Samples of groundwater were also collected from well GW11 at the Smoky Canyon Mine, between 2002 and 2007. Chemical analyses of groundwater were reported independently by the Dry Valley and Smoky Canyon Mines . Tables A 1-1 through A1-3 in Appendix A1 summarize groundwater chemistry for wells GW7D, GW7D2a / GW7D2 b, and GW11, respectively. Each of these wells has been monitored over several years (1998 to present) for a suite of regulated parameters . Groundwater chemistry samples were collected following standard operating procedures at each mine site, which are consistent with best management practice for regulatory compliance. Generally, this involved low flow pumping to avoid disturbing sediment or degassing of samples, monitoring of physical and chemical parameters, and appropriate filtration and preservation of samples for analysis within required holding times. Data were managed by third -party contractors and disclosed in operational compliance reports [4, 5]. Monitoring continues at the Dry Valley Mine , but ended in 2007 at the Smoky Canyon Mine when the well head was buried as a result of ongoing backfill construction. Groundwater collected from these monitoring projects allowed collection of samples for microbial cultivation and collection of sediment for molecular biology studies . Samples for microbial work were collected manually, using a new plastic disposable bailer, sealed in a plastic bag, for each sampling event. Each bailer was rinsed several times with groundwater from the well prior to collection of the sample for 74 analysis. The bailer was used to stir -up water low in the drill hole and to obtain turbid samples containing both sediment and water from each well.

A total of 4 chert, 21 shale, 7 mudstone, and 2 limestone samples were collected from GW7D2 at the Dry Valley Mine. An additional 24 samples (5 chert, 12 shale, and 7 mudstone) were collected at the Smo ky Canyon Mine, using methods described in Appendix A-2. Gradation data (sorting of material by particle sizes) for all samples are summarized in Table A 2-3 and Figures A2- 1 and A2-2. Average g radation data for key rock types from both mines are shown in Figure 11, which indicate dominantly gravel and sandy materials with lesser amounts of silt and clay . As anticipated, gravel content is higher in chert than in shale, and mudstone samples contained higher concentrations of fine silt and clay . Chert samples collected from archived sonic cores were finer grained than those collected via excavation at the Smoky Canyon Mine. The overall lower percentage of fine sediments reported in this study (relative to those reported by Tetra 75 Tech/MFG for samples collected in 2006) likely suggests differences in sample preparation procedures and may reflect the presence of aggregates in these samples .

These results demonstrate the greater organic C content of the shale, and show that it contains a higher concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons than the chert. Both chert and shale 78 (octadecanal), and monocyclic aromatic (phthalate and benzene) compounds, but the shale also contains substantial amounts of naturally occurring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (naphthalene, dibenzothiophene, and phenanthrene). The 2005 overburden sampling program yielded representative bulk composites of shale, chert, and mudstone from the Dry Valley and Smoky Canyon mines with known composition (mineralogy, Se, Mn, Fe, S and organic C ). These samples were not collected with the deliberate intent of minimizing microbial contamination between samples and were not preserved to protect the microbial community. Microbial cross-contamination could not be avoided in the sieving process. Rock samples collected in 2005 were thus not appr opriate for microbial analysis . These rock samples were autoclaved (steam sterilized 45 min utes at 121\u00b0C (250\u00b0F) at a minimum of 15 psi) , rested for 48 hours, and re-autoclaved to ensure sterilization prior to use as a substrate for rate experiments performed with live cultures collected through groundwater sampling. It is possible that steam sterilization altered the underlying mineralogy to some degree, but this was deemed unavoidable to maintain experimental control with available resources. As all experiments were treated equally, the influence of this method was likely uniform throughout the study. 2006 Drilling, Microbial Geochemistry, and In Situ Monitoring Program In this study , 15 samples ( 3 chert, 7 shale, 4 mudstone and 1 limestone ) were collected from three of the 2006 sonic drill holes (SCA, SCD, and MEV) for analysis of 79 Table 3.

Multiple additional samples were collected and frozen for additional DNA extraction as needed (Table A3.1). These samples are listed in Table 3, with the results of the geochemical analyses and in situ moisture, gas, and temperature data that were subsequently collected from these locations by Tetra Tech and O'Kane Consultants. In situ monitoring data reported for Smoky Canyon from soil suction/temperature sensors, soil moisture content sensors, and lysimeters installed at three in situ locations indicate variable moisture content resulting from textural differences between the topsoil and chert layers [3, 11]. Topsoil had elevated water conten t (18 to 20%), with chert values increasing from 10-12% up to 12-14% (depending upon depth) throughout four months of monitoring between Oc tober 2006 and January 2007. Water content in the deepest portion of monitored ROM overburden (at a depth of approxim ately 72 inches), at a location with relatively low net percolation, the volumetric water content ranged from 18% during the late winter and early spring to a low of 8% during thesummer and fall. Under higher net percolation conditions, the volumetric water content in the deepest sensor ranged from a maximum value of 30% to a low of 16% [12]. More steady state conditions, with less seasonal variation, would be expected with depth, except where changes in grain size and compaction affect capillarity and moisture retention. These data indicate the presence of dominantly unsaturated conditions below the cover at the monitored locations. 81 Groundwater Monitoring Multiple analyses of groundwater were reported by Agrium and Simplot for the studied monitoring wells; these results are summarized in Table 4 and provided in greater detail in Tables A1-1 through A1-3 included in Appendix A1. These results show increased SO 42-, SeO 42-, and O 2 concentrations in GW11, and lower Fe and pH, relative to the groundwater at the Dry Valley Mine that was measured in wells GW7D, GW7D2a and GW7D2b. Soluble Mn and NO 3- concentrations were approximately the same. Discussion - Backfil l Hydrogeochemistry Moisture and gas concentrations varied substantially throughout backfilled overburden in the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area. Saturated conditions existed deep in the backfill at the Dry Valley Mine, within a confined zone above the regional aquifer. Moisture contents close to or exceeding predicted field capacity based on particle gradation (22-27%) were also identified at the Enoch Valley (24%) and Luxor (22.6%) mines low in the backfill, but above zones of unsaturated rock (with moisture contents ranging from 6 to 14%), suggesting that perched aquifers with suboxic characteristics may also exist within the lower backfill at those locations. Moisture contents for other samples from the four monitored holes studied by Tetra Tech range from 4 to 19% moisture, and are dominantly unsaturated, with some minor variation in water content up to field capacity in rare instances [2]. Higher moisture contents, though still unsaturated, tended to be in the mid- depth intervals. No water was collected from any of the drill holes, although wells were completed for potential future collection of groundwater. 82 Table 4. Summary of study area hydrogeochemistry .

Summary of study area h ydrogeochemistry , continued . 84 Oxygen content varied from atmospheric to non- detectable levels depending on location. Oxygen was measured at generally atm ospheric (or slightly lower levels) throughout the overburden at the Smoky Canyon Mine in both SCA and SCD, but was less than 0.2% volume within 10 feet of the overburden surface at the Dry Valley, Enoch Valley, and Luxor mines backfills. This volume is inferred to be due to differences in the method of dump construction, with end-dumped materials more open to bar ometric pumping and ongoing gas exchange with the atmosphere than dumps constructed in discrete lifts [2]. Dumps that were built in lifts appear to ha ve more limited exchange of O 2 with the atmosphere, and any O 2 introduced during backfill construction has been depleted, presumably through biological or chemical oxidation processes. Temperature at depth in the monitored wells ranged from 8.5 to 11.9\u00b0C, which is typical of conditions in the shallow subsurface, with minor seasonal variation. Geochemical analysis of Se leachability indicated generally low rates of Se release (compared to whole rock Se content) in all of the samples, although there was some variability that could be lithology or moisture dependent. Selenium leachability does not appear to be O 2 dependent (e.g., greater at the Smoky Canyon Mine than at other locations) in the relatively dry mater ials of the monitored sites. Apparent differences in Se leachability under unsaturated and saturated conditions may also be related to seasonal changes in groundwater flow. They may also reflect microscale changes in redox conditions resulting from biologi cal activity. The Tetra Tech study provides excellent geochemical background data for this investigation [2]. Acid -base accounting data, which are not summarized here, indicate 85 low levels of sulfide and abundant carbonate mineralization, with overall net neutralizing conditions throughout the backfill. Although total C varied between lithologies in all three drill holes, t he dissolved organic C concentr ations were stoichiometrically adequate to support microbial activity based on observed electron acceptor concentrations within the sampled backfill and dump [2] . The trace element and C content of chert and shale differ from one another, but are relatively consistent when compared between locations at the Dry Valley, Smoky Canyon, and Enoch Valley Mines. Key differences between the lithologies include total Se, S, Fe and organic C content (especially, aromatic C content). Backfill seems to have elevated concentrations of both Mn and NO 3-, with some variability. Groundwater chemistry described at these sites varied with O 2 availability in the backfill, with higher concentrations of SO 42- and SeO 42- (and lower pH and concentrations of Fe) present in water with detectable O 2. Concentrations of SO 42- and SeO 42- were higher, and dissolve Fe was lower, at Smoky Canyon in monitoring well GW11 than at Dry Valley, in GW7D or GW7D2a/2b, where O 2 levels were lower. In Situ Conditions Considered in Experimental Designs The variation in lithology (including mineralogy, geochemistry, and organic C speciation), moisture content, and O 2 is potential ly significa nt for Se reduction, as described in the conceptual models presented in Chapter 2. Shale, chert, and mudstone were placed randomly as backfill into mined-out panels, and contain variable amounts of total and soluble Se, S, Fe, Mn, and NO 3-. Sulfate measured in groundwater reflects the 86 ongoing process of sulfide oxidation within these neutral to alkaline deposits. Oxygen range d from atmospheric to below detection within backfill, apparently controlled by changes in gas flux at the facility scale and driven by differences in backfill placement methods. Moisture content varied considerably, from the as -mined values of 2 to 4% in coarse cherts to near field capacity in shales, and saturated conditions existed where panels extended below the groundwater table. In fact, the only consistencies between the facilities were the random variation of mixed waste rock mined from the sa me stratigraphic section of the Meade Peak member of the Phosphoria F ormation and the temperatures, which were consistently between 8 and 12\u00b0C. In spite of the complex setting, and the subtle effects of moisture, lithology, and O2 controls on in situ Se b iogeochemistry, the combination of conditions developed at the Dry Valley Mine has been sufficient to support in situ reduction of soluble Se and NO 3- for more than ten years. This study explores the biogeochemical processes that influence the rate and ext ent of this reduction. The potential to develop similar ly reducing conditions through intentional design at other mine sites, once the required conditions have been adequately defined , is high. Although hydrocarbon degradation is likely to be slow in cold, subsurface environments, the large mass of available C and the slow flux of water within the backfill environments (with residence time estimated on the order of years) suggests that a sustaina ble process of C mineralization coupled to anaerobic reduction of NO 3- , Fe3+, and/or Mn4+ could support long- term in situ SeO 42- reduction. Demonstration of natural attenuation as a means of operational source control of Se within phosphate backfill requires documentation of biological processes that promote Se 87 reduction, within the complex biogeochemical environment of backfilled phosphate overburden. The experiments described in the following chapters were designed to integrate the in situ characterizatio n results with a conceptual understanding of Se reduction at both the micro and facility scales. Integration of the in situ data with the conceptual models described in Chapter 2 offers a framework, described below, for experimental study of Se reduction within backfilled phosphate overburden in the S.E. Idaho Phosphate R esource Area. Samples. To address the hypothesis that s imilar conditions for Se reduction could be developed throughout the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area, rock and groundwater samples were collected for study at three mine sites located (approximately) along a 30 mile transect from NW to SE through the re gion. Lithology and Oxygen as Key Variables. Lithology, C content, trace element geochemistry, and mineralogy of substrate within backfilled mine waste varies, due to random placement of ROM waste rock (55% shale, 35% chert, and 10% mudstone) during mine backfill operations. Rock that is randomly backfilled into mined pits weathers as moisture infiltrates from the surface , transporting O 2 that is progressively consumed through oxidation of reduced mineral phases and aerobic metaboli c processes . Changes in pore size within variably graded rock influence gas exchange and the potential for preferential flow . Availability of O 2 is determined by the balance between the relative rate of recharge and consumption processes, and therefore, O 2 availability and moisture content vary within the randomly placed backfill. Shale, with its finer grained texture and higher organic content was hypothesized to support more Se-r educing 88 bacteria (SeRB) and faster Se reduction than chert. Sampling and experimental protocols for estimating total numbers of SeRB, and for batch reactors, therefore addressed lithology and O 2 availability as primary variables . Native Rock and Groundwater Substrates . Selenium, along with SO 42- oxidation of primary (depositional) sulfide and selenide minerals. Secondary (alteration) Se -host ed minerals and soluble Se oxyanions contribute Se to solution via dissolution and/or desorption from exposed mineral surfaces. Phosphate from phosphorite mineralization may also be soluble, along with Fe and Mn. As these elements have potential to inhibit or support Se reduction by microbes, concentration changes in these elements were monitored as dependent variables in rate experiments . Experiments that a ddress the number and identity of native Se-reducing organisms, under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and the rate of Se reduction, were therefore completed using native rock and groundwater to provide representative SO 42-, NO 3-, Fe3+, Mn4+, and PO 43- conditions. Saturated Experiment al Focus . Selenium transport from backfill into groundwater conceptually occurs most significantly under saturated conditions, when SeO 42- is transported in groundwater from oxidized surface sediments into more reduced and compacted sediments within the backfill. As water moves deeper, O 2 is depleted and denitrifying conditions begin to dominate. Studies of Se reduction rates were therefore conducted under saturated, microaerophilic conditions. Electron Donors and Acceptors . Hydrocarbon degradation pathways would also be expected to shift from aerobic to denitrifying and anaerobic pathways, with 89 progressive ly more involvement of Fe and Mn elemental cycling under anaerobic conditions. Under these hypothesized conditions, redox potential is lower, enhancing the stability of reduced Se phases . Simpler forms of C (such as decane or hexane) formed by degradation of more complex aromatic hydrocarbon compounds would continue to be produced to support SeO 42- reduction. Transition from aerobic to microaerophilic or anoxic conditions implies the existence of a mixed community of microorganisms capable of aerobic, facultative, or obligate anaerobic metabolisms, using available C compounds as electron donors coupled with the reduction of a variety of possible electron acceptors (O 2, Mn4+, NO 3-, Fe3+, SeO42-, SeO 32- or S O42-). Changes in the microbial community, in response to changing O 2, Mn4+, NO 3-, Fe3+, and SO 42- concentrations measured in batch reactors, were described to evaluate this possibility . Ca-HCO 3-SO 42- Groundwater Geochemistry. The geochemistry of the is dominantly alkaline , with Ca -HCO sulfide oxidation within the sediments presumably generates local acidity at the pore scale , which is subsequently neutralized by available carbonate. The pH was allowed to vary independently in the experiments presented here. It was documented in bottle roll extr acts used to develop media for the enumeration and isolation of microorganisms, as well as batch reactors . Temperature. Temperatures ranged from an average of 10 \u00b0C in the subsurface to 25 \u00b0C or more, seasonally, at the land surface. T emperatures of 10 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C were imposed in rate experiments, to evaluate the influence of this range of temperatures on SeO 42- reduction. 90 Experimental conditions. The experimental conditions imposed in the microbial isolation s, enumeration studies , and rate experiments (Table 5) were designed to account for the observed variation in lithology, O 2, moisture content, pH, soluble SO 42-, NO3-, Fe, and Mn concentrations. All three lithotypes (chert, shale and mudstone) were used for these studies. Carbon was added to these experiments to ensure that the maximum possible number of SeO 42--reducing organisms was represented. Enrichments were prepared under the Table 5 . Experimental designs based on subsurface backfill conditions.

The most probable number (MPN) enumeration studies were performed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, at the field relevant temperature of 10\u00b0C and in the dark. The results of enumeration studies indicated that little, if any, SeO 42- reduction occurred under aerobic conditions, and showed that the number of SeO 42--reducing organisms was lower in unsaturated samples of chert and mudstone than in shale. Based on these MPN 91 results, subsequent rate experiments focused on anaerobic conditions in chert, shale, and ROM rock . An understanding of the rate at which native organisms in the different lithologies can reduce SeO 42- under microaerophilic to anaerobic conditions under controlled temperature conditio ns is essential to the design of pilot scale facilities with sufficient residence time to support in situ reduction as an operational method of Se source control. To address the hypothesis that Se re duction would proceed most rapidly, efficiently, and permanently in shale rather than chert or mixed waste under field temperatures, rate experiments were conducted for individual lithotypes under controlled temperature; known total Fe, Mn, NO 3-, SO 42-, and PO 43; and variable O 2, pH, and C availability conditions in closed systems . Measurements of C use and changes in biomass, as well as changes in pH and concentrations of soluble potential competitive electron acceptors, were used to describe the process and capacity for microbial reduction of soluble Se. Similarly, measurements of Se speciation and biomineralization products during the reduction process were made. 92 References 1.

Idaho Lisa Bithell Kirk1, Jared Bozeman1, and Susan E. Childers2 Department of Land Resources and Environmental Sciences, Montana State University, Bozeman MT1 Geological Sciences, University of Idaho, Moscow ID2 Abstract A consortium of native microbes with potential for SeO 42- reduction in subsurface mine waste at several S .E. Idaho phosphate mines were identified and enumerated under a range of field-relevant oxygen (O2), moisture, and lithology conditions. Samples of groundwater and unsaturated sediments collected from the subsurface were used to isolate Se -tolerant and Se-reducing microorganisms from the overburden backfill. A most probable number (MPN) method was used to estimate the number of -reducing bacteria ( SeRB ) in groundwater , chert, shale, and mudstone samples, and both cultivation and molecular methods were used to identify b acteria present in the most dilute positive MPN cultures. Bacterial clone libraries were developed for the two samples of shale with the highest estimated numbers of SeRB, and changes in microbial diversity as a fu nction of lithotype and moisture conditions were compared using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The most favorable conditions for Se reduction appear to be in saturated or moist conditions (close to field capa city) where sufficient soluble Se and organic carbon is available to support higher numbers of SeRB. Molecular analysis of community structure in saturated and unsaturated sediments show 16S rRNA sequences with high similarity and aerobic genera Polaromonas and Rhodoferax . SeRB reduce SeO 42- using complex naturally- occurring hydrocarbon compounds and potentially other electron donors under Fe3+, Mn4+ and NO 3- reducing conditions. It is proposed that degradation of complex shale hydrocarbons by aerobic and facultative anaerobic members of the community decreases available O2, thus creating conditions favorable for SeO 42- reduction by SeRB with high similiarity to the genera Dechloromonas , Stenotrophomona, Anaeromyxobacter and other hetrotrophic SeRB. This characterization of the indigenous SeO 42--reducing community can be used to evaluate design options for in situ microbial source control of Se at phosphate mine operations. 96 Introduction Control of selenium (Se) concentrations in mine drainage is a concern for phosphate producers at several mine sites in the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area (Figure 1 2). Selenium is a naturally -occurring metalloid that is biologically essential in small d oses, but toxic at higher concentrations [ 1].

Rock sample locations are indicated to the right of each drill hole at the corresponding sampled depth; the ID reflects the sampling location and rock type, e.g. MS5 represents M for Monsanto's Enoch Valley drillhole MEV, S for Shale, and 5 for 5 feet of depth. Likewise, SCA represents Smoky Canyon drillhole A and SCD represents Smoky Canyon drill hole D. Groundwater monitoring wells are numbered as shown, GW7D- 2a (Dry Valley) and GW11 (Smoky Canyon). 97 waste during phosphate extraction. Selenium associated with host minerals is released by oxidation and leaching of phosphatic mine overburden and persists as soluble selenate (SeO 42-) and bi selenite -selenite (SeO 32--HSeO 3-) species under the neutral to alkaline conditions that characterize the near -surface geochemical environment [2]. Soluble Se concentration in thes e settings varies, depending on site -specific moisture content, oxygen (O 2) availability and biogeochemistry of overburden lithologies (Table 6) [ 3]. Groundwater monitoring in backfilled sediments at two mine locations, Smoky Canyon (GW11) and Dry Valley (GW7D2a), exhibited a 50- fold difference in soluble Se concentration s (Table 6) despite the fact that both wells were completed in mixed Phosphoria shale (55%), chert (35%) and mudstone (10%) waste produced using similar mining methods. The average Se concentration was highest in the shale, where Se substitut ed for sulfur (S) in sulfide mine rals in unweathered rock and occur red as sorbed oxyanions or elemental selenium (Se 0) in weathered material. USGS reports Se values ranging from 1 to 1040 mg/kg for the Meade Peak member of the Phosphoria Formation, with an average value of 28 mg/kg in altered rock , and 82 mg/kg in unweathered shale [4]. In contrast, the Rex chert contains between <0. 2 and 138 mg/kg Se, with an average value of 7 mg/kg [ 5]. Carbon content and speciation als o varies between lithologies. Although some rock is placed in external dumps, most overburden is randomly placed as internal backfill into mined -out panels (or pits), creating complex subsurface hydrogeochemical environments that vary in moisture and O 2 content ( Table 6, after TetraTech, 2008). Abiotic mechanisms known to control concentrations of Se oxyanions are limited in the neutral pH to alkaline pH range relevant in these settings . Mineral 98 Table 6.

Groundwater chemistry as reported by TetraTech 2007 , O 2, CO 2 (vol%) measured in situ Aug 2006 [3], Total S% by LECO, Sobek Carbon (TOC) by method ASA9-29-2.2.4 [3] Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) by SW -846 followed by ASA 9 -29-2.2.4 [3] 99 solubility is unlikely to control dissolved Se concentrations, and sorption onto metal oxide, carbonate, and clay minerals is likely to be inefficient [6, 7]. Neither mechanism could be shown to fully explain the differences observed between the two wells , suggesting that biotic mechanisms may control soluble Se co ncentrations. Abiotic reduction of Se(VI), the oxyanion SeO 42- , to Se(IV), which occurs as either HSeO 3- or SeO 32- depending upon pH , is kinetically limited and proceeds very slowly except when catalyzed by green rust [8, 9] or Se -reducing microorganisms (SeRB) [10]. SeRB are phylogenetically diverse and include many Bacteria and some Archaea and Eukarya that can detoxify or respire SeO 42- or SeO 32-. Substantial energy can be gained through respiratory reduction of SeO 42- to SeO 32- by Selenium reduction along respirator y pathways is not always growth -dependent [18, 19]. A few bacterial genera capable of aerobic SeO 42- reduction have also been identified [ 20, 21]. Reduction of SeO 42- for detoxification purposes appear s to occur using a specific of SeO 42- reductase in E. cloacae SLD1a1 [22] , but otherwise involves non- substrate specific enz ymes associated with NO 3- and NO 2- [19] or SO 42- reduction[ 23, 24 ]. While SeO 32- reduction to Se (0) or Se(-II) is less energ etically favorable than SeO42- reduction, this strategy is used for detoxification by a variety of organisms . Some organisms can reduce SeO 42- fully to Se(0) or Se(-II), while others will only reduce Se O42- to SeO 32- or SeO 32- to Se( -II). Complete reduction of soluble oxyanions to 100 insoluble Se0 or Se2- minerals can thus depend on community- level interactions between multiple organisms [25]. Previous work on microbial Se transformations in phosphate mine wastes from the Smoky Canyon Mine identified a variety of SeO 42--reducing microorganisms using cultivation and molecular methods [ 26]. Using near surface samples from the Smoky Canyon Mine, the microbial community was evaluated along with its potential to influence Se speciation in response to the application of iron (Fe) , compost, and whey amendments as potential bioremediation treatments . A number of isolates were identified, based on their ability to reduce SeO 42-, and were found to belong primarily to the Enterobacteriaceae family , although other gamma- and betaproteobacteria were found, members Oxalobacteraceae and Rhodocyclaceae families . Knotek- Smith, et al. [26] concluded, based on amended column experiments, that Fe amen dment to promote the precipitation of insoluble Fe- selenide minerals is the preferred strategy for remediation of SeO 42- in phosphate waste [27]. Of common interest to the present study was the identification of SeO 42- reduction by members of the Rhodoferax and Rahnella genera in laboratory experiments, and the conclusion that further study of microbial populations in environmental samples was needed to resolve questions about SeO 42- mobility in a mine waste setting [26]. The objectives of the present study were to (1) characterize the indigenous microbial population involved in t he Se reduction observe d in backfill at the Dry Valley Mine, and (2) to test for SeO 42- -reducing organisms in subsurface mine waste samples collected from the nearby Smoky Canyon and Enoch Valley phosphate mines, under a 101 range of conditions identified in situ . Here, samples of turbid groundwater and sediment from SeO 42--reducing enrichments were used to isola te and enumerate Se -tolerant and Se-reducing microorganisms from groundwater, chert, shale, and mudstone s amples . Mixed communities of B acteria in waste rock were described using bacterial clone libraries and denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis ( DGGE ). Together with data characterizing Se reduction rates in specific lithotypes under controlled O 2 and temperature conditions, and aqueous and mineral Se speciation data ( Chapter 5 ), this characterization of the indigenous SeO 42- -reducing community can be used to evaluate options for in situ microbial source control of Se at phosphate mine operations. Materials and Methods Sample Collection and P reservation Multiple samples of groundwater and overburden were collected for the isolation of SeRB and for the characterization of microbial community diversity using molecular methods. Sampling locations shown in Figure 1 2 included two groundwater monitoring wells, and multiple depths within three drill holes completed in mined overburden. Groundwater samples were collected from a well completed in saturated backfill at the base of backf illed pit B at the Dry Valley Mine (GW7D2a) and from a well completed in partially (and intermittently) saturated backfill at the Smoky Canyon Mine (GW11). Each well was sampled for major and trace element chemistry , and select results are presented for ke y elements in Table 6. Water was bailed manually using a new, disposable plastic bailer at each site, weighted to facilitate sediment recovery during sampling. The bailer 102 was rinsed with groundwater repeatedly prior to sample collection. Samples were trans ferred immediately into sterile glass or polypropylene bottles and stored at 10 \u00b0C in the dark under absence of headspace. Groundwater pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) content, and temperature were recorded at the time of sampling. DO was measured using a YSI probe at the Dry Valley Mine, and initially with a Hach kit at the Smoky Canyon Mine and la ter using an O2 probe. Sediments associated with the groundwater samples were concentrated by centrifugation at 13000xg for 10 minutes and stored saturated at or below 10\u00b0C until use. Overburden rock samples were collected from existing mine backfill and rock dump facilities at the Smoky Canyon Mine (drill holes SCA and SCD) and Enoch Valley Mine (drill hole MEV) using a sonic drill. A total of 14 samples were selected to represent the range of lithologies encountered within the three drill holes. During the drilling process, samples were quickly preserved to limit (to the extent possible) any changes in temperature, gas, moisture, and redox conditions resulting from exposure of rocks to surface conditions. As samples were removed from the core barrel, they were placed into Lexan \u00ae plastic s and labeled. The temperature of core samples was measured to avoid collection of overheated (above 37\u00b0C ) samples as a result of friction between the core barrel and the rock during the drilling process. Each interval was placed on sheets of fresh plastic within a nitrogen (N 2)-flooded and sanitized (10% bleach and 70% ethanol) glove box. Once in the glove box, the sample bag was opened and the mineralogy, moisture, and clastic content were described qualitatively . Afterwards, the internal core was exposed and sub-sampled using sterilized utensils. The sub- samples were 103 composited, split into several sterile containers for mineralogical, microbial, molecular, and hydrogeochemical analysis, and preserved under both aerobic and anaerobic (20x pore volume flushed N 2 headspace) conditions. Containers were sealed to conserve moisture and stored in the dark at temperatures at or below the me asured average subsurface temperature of 10 \u00b0C. Samples stored under aerobic conditions were aerated periodically or maintained with a 0.22 \u00b5 m filtered port to allow for atmospheric exchange. Samples of rock collected for this study were analyzed independently to determine total and leachable organic carbon , Se and S, and moisture content by TetraTech, Inc., an independent contractor who managed the drilling program (summarized in Table 6). Total Se was extracted following EPA method 3050 and leachable Se was extracted using EPA method 1312, followed by Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry ( ICP-MS) analysis using method EPA 6020. Lea chable and total organic carbon (TOC) were determined for rock samples using method SW -846 with ASA 9 -29-2.2[ 28]. Total S was measured by LECO furnace with S speciation determined using the modified Sobek method (M600/2-78-054 1.3 [ 29]. Moisture conte nt was determined by measuring sample weight before and after drying in a 34\u00b0C oven [ 28]. Temperature, O 2, and carbon dioxide ( CO 2) concentrations were also measured in situ at multiple depths within the drill holes using thermocouples and plastic tubing taped to the outside of the well casing and completed at select depths, as described in the installation report provided in Appendix A3 [ 3]. 104 Se Reduction by N ative Microbes : Batch experiments were conducted to verify biotic SeO 42- reduction in mixed mine overburden. Batch reactors were constructed in triplicate using 30 g of steam -autoclaved rock (mixed rock comprised of 45% shale, 35% chert, and 10% mudstone) and 30 mL of sterile deionized water in 250 mL glass serum bottles . The grain size distribution of these lithologies is described in Figure 11. Rock used in these experiments represented a composite of each lithotype. Hydrocarbon species were extracted from representative samples of shale and chert collected at the Smoky Canyo n Mine using methylene chloride, followed by Gas Chromatography- Mass Spectrometry ( GC-MS) analysis , to identify the native hydrocarbon compounds that were present in the run- of-mine (ROM) waste. Each reactor was mixed on a shaker table open to the atmosphere for 12 hours to dissolve salts under the aerobic conditions expected to exist within near surface portions of mine waste. Reactors were inoculated with 25.3 mL turbid groundwater (live and autoclaved control), sealed, and residual O 2 removed by flushing bottles with ultrapure N 2 gas through a 0.2 \u00b5m sterile filter. Each reactor was spiked with 10 mg/L Se as SeO 42- (based on maximum field measured concentrations) and incubated at room temperature (approximately 25\u00b0C) and 10\u00b0C under dark conditions. No external carbon source was added. Samples of mixed water and sediment were collected immediately using a N 2-purged syringe, and every 12 hours for 10 days, and centrifuged at 13,000x g to remove solids. The supernatant was removed and diluted 1:500 with an acid mix comprised of 1.0% HNO 3, 0.5% HCl prior to analysis of total Se, Fe, and Mn using an Agilent 7500ce I CP-MS with the hydrogen (H 2)-gas collision cell following EPA method 200.8 [ 30]. Samples were removed from the reactor for O 2 105 measurement using a Hach AQ4 dissolved O 2 meter (Loveland, CO) and pH measurement using an Acumet AB15 pH meter with a probe model no. 13-620- AP (Cole Parmer). Enrichments and C ultivation : Enrichment cultures were prepared to obtain SeRB from rock samples. Isolations of SeRB were also performed using the most dilute positive most probable number ( MPN ) cultures (see method, Appendix B). Enrichment and isolation methods are summarized in Appendix C1. Media consis ted of filter sterilized groundwater containing 0.01% yeast extract to provide trace vitamins and nutrients and 0.2 to 20 mM SeO 42-. Carbon sources included native carbon extracted from rock, or lactate, acetate, and /or pyruvate individually or combined, or a cocktail containing all of the above, at total concentrations that were in approximate molar proportion to the amount of added SeO 42-. The native carbon that was present in the rock varied, both in chemistry and concentration (Table 7), and its extractability in deionized wa ter differed between lithotypes. A mixture of shale, chert, and mudstone was thus used to make media in a ratio based on the relative proportion of shale:chert:mudstone lithotypes typical of mined overburden (55:35:10). The co ncentration of carbon that could be extracted from rock samples varied, unlike that of lactate, acetate, and pyruvate, which was used in constant molar proportion. Enrichments were prepared in a glove box with a headspace of 2%H 2/98%N 2 and kept in sealed bottles under a N 2 headspace. Enrichments for autotrophic SeRB were similarly prepared except half of the N2 headspace was replaced with a 1:1 mixture of H 2-CO 2 and no exogenous carbon sources or yeast extract were added. Enrichments were incubated for 6 to 8 weeks at 10\u00b0C or until 106 a red precipitate was noted visually. The cultures were sampled periodically for changes in turbidity and color. Table 7.

Samples of turbid groundwater and MPN -diluted rock samples were directly plated onto solid media to obtain SeRB. Agar (3% by weight) was added to the enrichment media described above, and plates were poured and allowed to solidify in the glove box. Groundwater samples (0.1 ml) were spread onto solid media and plat es were kept anaerobic using an Anaeropak system under a 21% CO 2 atmosphere (Fisher Scientific). Samples from drill holes MEV, SCA, and SCD were serially diluted to 10-4, 10-5 and 10-6 in 5 mM carbon -specific filter -sterilized groundwater media (e.g., native 107 carbon or lactate or acetate or pyruvate) and 0.1ml of each dilution was plated onto solid media in the glove box. Colonies showing unique morphologies were isolated by streaking onto solid media until pure. Pure cultures were then maintained in aqueous medium comprised of filter -sterilized site specific groundwater containing 0.03 mM native carbon (extracted from ROM rock using deionized water in a bottle roll for digestion ), to which 0.01% yeast extract, 2 mM SeO 42-, and 2 mM each of lactate, pyruvate, and acetate were added to create the enrichment cocktail . Notes and photographs describing the enrichment process are provided in Appendix C1. Enumeration of SeO 42--Reducing Microorgani sms: An MPN approach [ 31] was used to estimate the number of SeRB in each sample. Samples of chert, mudstone, shale, and groundwater were serially diluted with a rock extract solution containing 0.2 mM each of acetate, pyruvate, and lactate, and a field -relevant concentration of 0.1 mM SeO 42-. The bottle roll rock extract solution was prepared for each rock sample using a gyrator -shaken sample of rock and water (water: rock mass ratio of 2.65:1) , covered but open to the atmosphere. After 12 hours, solids were allowed to settle and fines in suspension were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000xg for 10 minutes. The rock extract was then filter -sterilized using a 0.22 \u00b5 m filter, the pH was recorded, and sulfate ( SO 42-), total dissolved organic carbon (D OC), NO 3-, SeO 42-, and SeO 32-, were analyzed (Table 7). Ion chromatography was used to measure anion concentrations using a Dionex model DX500 equipped with an IonPac AS -9-HC (4 x 250 mm) anion column and a CD 20 detector. Samples (25 \u00b5L) were injected into an 11 mM Na 2CO 3 mobile phase flowing at 0.9 mL/min, both at full strength to measure low concentrations of most ions and diluted 108 25X with deionized water to measure higher concentrations of SO 42-. Solvent ext ractable organic carbon was extracted using methylene chloride by EPA method 3550B and analyzed by GC-MS following EPA Method 8270C [ 32]. Dissolved organic carbon was measured by Shimadzu infrared, following standard method 5310. Dilutions were performed following a standard test protocol with 10-fold dilutions carried out to 10 -8 dilution. The r esulting solutions were then divided into aliquot tubes, which contained 10 ml each. MPN cultures were prepared both aerobically in capped test tubes, and anaerobically in sealed serum bottles, with a 50% N 2, 25% H 2 and 25% CO 2 headspace, and were kept at 10\u00b0C. The chemical analyses of bottle roll extracts (pH, NO 3-, total N, SO 42-, DOC, total dissolved Fe and Mn, SeO 42-, and SeO 32-) are provided in Table 7. Due to the strong humic content of the phosphatic shales, and dark color of the rock, it was necessa ry to replace colorimetric indicators of reduction in MPN tubes with quantitative measurements of total dissolved Se. Samples (1 ml) were removed from each culture and centrifuged at 13,000x g to remove solids. The supernatant was diluted 1:500 with an acid mix comprised of 1.0% HNO 3, 0.5% HCl prior to analysis of total Se using an Agi lent 7500ce ICP-MS with the hydrogen- gas collision cell following EPA method 200.8 [ 30]. Tubes were scored positive if they showed a minimum of 10% reduction in soluble Se concentration. ICP-MS analyses of total Se collected for the approximately 2,600 MPN tubes (16 samples for two O2 treatments, in duplicate, with 40 tubes per experiment) are listed in Table B.1.4 of Appendix B. The original ICP- MS data are provided on the accompanying CD. 109 DNA Extractions and PCR . Nucleic acids were extracted from enrichments, soil, and groundwater sediment samples. Attempts at direct extraction of DNA from MPN cultures were initially unsuccessful, likely due to the low biomass in the limited culture volume. Therefore, samples from MPN tubes were transferred to fresh media using methods described above to obtain a sufficient volume of biomass for extractions. Nucleic acids were extracted using the Power Soil DNA Isolation Kit TM (Mo -Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA). The manufacturer's method was modified by first incubating samples in 20% SDS at 70 \u00b0C for 1 hour, then vortexing for 20 minutes to breakup any biofilm and detach organisms. After mixing, the entire sample was used for the extraction of nucleic acids as detail ed in the protocol provided by the manufacturer. PCR was performed on extracted DNA to amplify 16S rRNA genes using a nested approach to optimize yield [33]. Initially, 10 cycles were run using the initial PCR were diluted 1:10 and used as template in a 30 cycle PCR using 1070F and 1392GC. Reactions (50 \u00b5 l) contain ed template ( 2 to 50 ng DNA), 0.2 mM each primer, and PCR mastermix (Promega, Madison, WI, 25 \u00b5L), using an Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient thermocycler. Conditions were the same for both PCRs and included denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 10 or 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 45 sec, 50\u00b0C for 45 sec, 72\u00b0C for 45 sec, and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. PCR amplicons were separated on a agarose gel by staining with ethidium bromide. 110 Colony PCR was used to amplify 16S rRNA genes from isolated SeRB . The resulting PCR products were screened for redundancy using the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) procedure . Colonies were picked using sterile pipet tips and suspended in nuclease- free deionized water (10 \u00b5l). Suspended cells (2 \u00b5L) were used as template in a 30 cycle PCR using 334F (5'- CCA GAC thermocycler. PCR conditions were 10 min at 94 \u00b0C, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 45 sec, annealing at 50\u00b0C for 45 sec, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 45 sec. The final extension period was 5 minutes at 72\u00b0C. The amplicons were digested for 3 hours at 37\u00b0C in a 20 \u00b5L volume that contained 10 \u00b5 L PCR product, 1X reaction buffer and 20U HaeIII. Fragments were in a 3.5% agarose gel , and dige stion patterns were grouped based on similarity . The PCR amplicon from several colonies representative of each RFLP group were used to obtain 16S rRNA gene sequence information. DGGE and Sequencing : PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 8- 12% acrylamide gels containing a 50 -60% urea -formamide gradient at 70 V and 60\u00b0C for 20 hours. Gel electrophoresis was performed using a DGGE -2401 system manufactured by CBS Scientific\u00ae, based on the general method described by Muyzer et al. [ 36]. Gels were stained with S YBR G old (Life Technologies Invitrogen TM) and visualized using UV light . A ladder of PCR amplified products from known isolates was prepared and used to compare with samples. The ladder included PCR amplicons from isolates with 111 >99% similarity bands of interest not re presented in the ladder were excised from the gel, resuspended in 15 \u00b5 L of nuclease -free water, and allowed to diffuse from the gel overnight at 60\u00b0C. Numerous bands were also cut from the gel to confirm ladder identification. Samples were mixed and acrylamide was pelleted by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was removed, diluted 1:10 in nuclease free water, and used as template in a 30 cycle PCR using primers 1070F and 1392R as described above. PCR products were purified using a Wizard SV Gel and PCR Cleanup System (Promega) and quantified using a Qbit fluorimeter ( Life Technologies Invitrogen TM). Samples were submitted to the Idaho State University Molecular Research Core Facility (ISU MRCF, www.isu.edu/bios/MRCF ) for sequencing using an Applied Biosystems\u00ae 3130XL Genetic Analyzer. The Basic Local Alignment Sear ch Tool (BLAST, NCBI ,http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) was used to query resulting sequences against a nonredundant database [37]. Images of a number of the gels used for the project are provided in Appendix C4. Clone L ibraries : Clone libraries were constructed for primary enrichments of rock samples AS71 and AS113, which hosted the greatest number of SeO 42--reducing organisms as estimated by MPN. 16S rRNA gene fragments were amplified by PCR using bacterial primers 1070F/1392R or archaeal primers Arc 21F (Integrated DNA Technologies, Mfg ID 41725659) and 958R (Integrated DNA Technologies, Mfg ID 41725669) [35]. The bacterial primers were chosen to be consistent with those used for 112 DGGE in the study. PCR conditions were 94\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 45 sec, 55\u00b0C for 45 sec, 72\u00b0C for 45 sec, and a final extension s tep at 72 \u00b0C for 1 minute. PCR products were cloned as described in the Invitrogen TOPO Cloning kit \u00ae protocol, cloned products were transformed into chemically competent E. coli cells, and transformants were plated onto solid media and screened by blue- white selection. White colonies were transferred to liquid media (LB), grown overnight, and plasmid DNA was extracted using a QIAprep\u00ae Miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The concentration of plasmid DNA was quantified using the Invitrogen QBit\u00ae fluorometer BR dsDNA (broad range double stranded Cloning methods are summarized in Appendix C3.1. Plasmid DNA samples were shipped to the ISU MRCF for DNA sequencing.Sequencing results were screened to eliminate samples that were not comprised exclusively of unambiguous bases or greater than 300 base pairs in length. Sequences were aligned using ClustalX, organized into a tree using the program ARB, and compared using Unifrac. Diversity within each libr ary was analyzed using the program DOTUR, a program for defining operational taxonomic units and species richness (Schloss, 2005). S equences were evaluated using BLAST to identify the closest relative . Further analysis of sequences allowed correction of antisense sequences resulting from inversion of the plasmid insert during the initial ligation, using the program Reverse Complement (Java Boutique, http://javaboutique.internet.com/revcomp/ ). Bioinformatics data and analyses are summarized in Appendix C3.2. 113 Results Sampling and In Situ Subsurface Characterization Sixteen samples were collected from the Smoky Canyon, Dry Valley, and Enoch Valley mines , including two samples of groundwater and fourteen samples of sediment from drill cores of unsaturated and unconsolidated overburden. Groundwater was collected from mixed lithology backfill deposits at the Dry Valley (GW7 D2a) and Smoky Canyon (GW11) mines; no groundwater was available from the Enoch Valley Mine. Samples collected from drill cores were chosen to represent the range of observed lithology and moisture conditions observed with depth in holes drilled into the random ly backfilled overburden deposits ( Figure 1 2). Geochemistry (summarized in Table 6) and particle size data (not reported) were measured for the same samples [3]. Table 6 summarizes in situ conditions in the groundwater monitoring wells completed in backfilled overburden (GW7D 2a, GW11), with conditions at sampled depths in drill holes MEV, SCA, and SCD. Measured pH in groundwater ranged from 6.5 to 7.8 and temperature ranged from 7 to 10\u00b0C. The concentration of dissolved Se in Dry Valley well GW7D2a was 0.0 21 mg/L, considerably below the Idaho groundwater standard of 0.050 mg/L, in contrast to the higher Se concentration of 1 mg/L measured in the Smoky Canyon well GW11. Diss olved oxygen (DO) is non-detectable in groundwater at Dry Valley, in contrast with 5.5 mg/L DO at Smoky Canyon. The highest SO 42- concentration, 1666 mg/L, correlated with higher DO levels in GW11, and indicates a higher rate of sulfide oxidation relative to GW7D and GW7D2 at the Dry Valley Mine 114 (See data Chapter 3) . NO 3- in groundwater, likely resulting from blasting residues, ranged from 0.3 to 5.6 mg/L . Levels of s oluble Fe and Mn (0.44 to 0.47 mg/L) were comparable in groundwater monitored at both the Dry Valley and Smoky Canyon Mines . No comparison could be made with the Enoch Valley Mine, where groundwater water quality was not reported. Table 6 also shows in situ conditions and characteristics of rock samples collected from drill holes MEV, SCA, and SCD. Drill hole temperatures ranged from 8 to 12\u00b0C. The O2 concentration was close to atmospheric in both SCA and SCD, but was not detectable below 32 feet in MEV or 10 feet at Dry Valley , apparently reflecting differences in the way rock was dumped during facility construction [ 3]. Carbon dioxide concentration s ranged from 6.6 to 9.6 volume % in MEV to only 4 volume % in the SCA and SCD holes. Total and dissolved Se, as well as TOC and DOC , varied with lithotype and were consistent with the values reported by the USGS for these sediments [ 4, 5, 38 ]. Carbon speciation varied between lithotype in the Phosphoria overburden as well, with shale containing more carbon and higher concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, phenanthrene, toluene, and dibenzothiophene relative to chert (Table 8). Potential for in situ Biological Se Reduction Potential for in situ biological reduction of Se was confirmed through comparisons of killed controls with SeO 42- reduction in live batch reactors of sterile mixed waste rock inoculated with site specific groundwater.

Nitrate was also consumed during this phase, although its complete removal was not required for SeO 42- reduction to proceed. The reduction of SeO 42- to SeO 32- and its ultimate removal from solution was associated with an increase in soluble Fe (to an upper limit of 110 mg/L ) and Mn (to 4 mg/L ), presumably due to concurrent microbial Fe and Mn reduction. The cause of the loss of soluble Fe at 272 hours is not known, but it may be related to the formation of the insoluble mineral ferroselite, FeSe 2, which w as identified in post reduction mineralogy studies (see chapter 5). Essentially no change was observed in the concentration of PO 43-, 116 which remained below detection (1 mg/L) . The concentration of SO 42- initially increased from 1035 mg/L to 1390 mg/L and remained constant during the Se reduction process. Se Figure 13.

Many of the apparent SeRB were mixed cultures and were observed to be closely associated with, and difficult to separate from, non- SeO 42- reducing organisms based on microscopy and sequencing results. The bacteria listed in Figure 14 were isolated from the mixed Figure 14. Genera identifications obtained from S.E.

Hundreds of colonies were screened in this process and eighty were chosen for identification by sequence analyses of 16S rRNA genes based on visual production of red elemental Se.

A list is provided as Table C.1.1 in Appendix C1. The majority of phylotypes associated with organisms isolated from samples of groundwater were h ighly similiar to the genus Dechloromonas ; these phylotypes comprised more than 33% of the bacterial population. Most sequences obtained for the se isolates were >97% identical to members of the Dechloromonas genus (based on an average read length of 584 bases) , but several sequences were > 96% similar to D. hortensis, D. denitrificans or Dechloromonas sp . A- 34 (S. Childers, unpublished). Another 17% of the isolate phylotypes were >99% similar to the bacterial genus Stenotrophomonas Additional organisms isolated from groundwater were >97% similar to of on sequences that ranged in length from 240 to 628 base pairs . A list of the genus level identifications for the microbes isolated during this study is provided in Appendix C1; corresponding sequences are provided in Appendix C2. Organisms most similar to members of the Rhodoferax w ere particularly challenging to isolate, due to their frequent occurrence in co -cultures with organisms that identified closely with members of the Cellulomonas and Actinobacterium genera. The organisms producing sequences that identified commonly isolated. 119 Enumeration of SeRB A MPN approach [ 31] was used to estimate the number of SeRB present in groundwater and in the individual lithology specific samples. The results of ICP-MS analyses of total Se used for the MPN analysis are summarized in Table B1.3; the data source files are listed in Table B1. 5 and provided electronically . Table 9 shows that the estimated number of SeRB was greatest in MPN tubes prepared and maintained under anaerobic conditions. Although aerobic tubes showed growth as evidenced by visible turbidity, little to no SeO 42- reduction was evident. Sediments from Dry Valley GW7D groundwater samples incubated under anaerobic conditions averaged 4.6 x 10 6 SeRB per gram of rock. Of the various rock lithotypes, higher numbers of SeRB were associated with shales than with cherts or mudstones, and more SeRB were present in the external Smoky Canyon panel A rock dump than in the backfilled overburden in Smoky Canyon panel D or at the Enoch Valley Mine (Table 9). The shale samples AS71 and AS113 had the highest number of estimated SeO 42- reducers , with values ranging between 105 and 106 organisms per gram of sediment. In contrast, fewer than 103 SeRB were present in mudstone or chert. 120 Table 9. MPN results and dominant bands cut from DGGE for most dilute positive MPN cultures.

The most dilute positive MPN enrichments for select shale samples were compared with single samples of mudstone and chert using DGGE. Figure 15 shows a moderate level of diversity with 5-10 bands evident for each sample; chert had greater diversity than shales as indicated by the greater number of bands in the upper gel. The shale samples AS71 and AS113, which had the greatest number of SeRB in MPN estimates, showed somewhat less diversity and generally consistent community characterist ics when compared with other shales or mudstone. Comparative sequence analysis of excised DGGE bands (see Figure B1.1 and Table B1.4, Appendix B1), yielded the limited number of phylotypes shown in Table 9. Comparison of samples in Figure 15 with a ladder (left) constructed using DNA from microbes isolated during this study suggests that the majority of rock samples contain phylotypes that are strongly similar to members of the ge nera Pseudomonas (>99%, 260- 280 bp) and Rhodoferax (>99%, 250-310 bp). Faint bands that align with one or more of the three Dechloromonas isolates are evident in shale samples, whereas the most dilute chert and mudstone MPN samples show bands that align wi th the amplicon for the isolate Dechloromonas sp. A-34 only. The identity of microorganisms represented by these bands could not be confirmed because they were too faint to cut. Phylotypes listed in italics in Figure 15, which were not included in the isolate ladder, were identified using 122 Figure 15. DGGE profiles comparing isolate ladder with groundwater and waste rock samples from Smoky Canyon, Dry Valley, and Enoch Valley mines, S.E. Idaho. 123 bands cut from gels where visualization and cutting of the bands was possible. While certain bands may have visually aligned, this does not necessarily guarantee that the bands came from the same population. To confirm that the ladder was servicing its purpose, a number of bands aligning with the isolate ladder were cut and submitted for sequence confirmation. Groundwater samples from backfills at the Smoky Canyon and Dry Valley mines were also compared with one another, the sediment samples, and the isolate lad der in Figure 15 . DNA was extracted directly from the biomass collected from these groundwater samples. Groundwater DNA samples yielded bands that were confirmed by comparative sequence analysis and also aligned with the ladder isolates of Other bands in samples of groundwater from GW7D2a that were cut, extracted and sequenced had strong similarity to phylotypes and AS113 had high estimated numbers of SeRB and contained phylotopes that were > 97% similar to known genera. Phylotypes sequenced from gel bands were closely related to several Rhodoferax species, including R. fermentans[ 39], Rhodoferax (>99%) were also identified. Though bands suggestive of several Dechloromonas species were apparent based on ladder alignment, these phylotypes could not be confirmed because bands were too faint to be excised and/or did not amplify successfully from excised bands. 124 Comparable diversity patterns are evident between shale samples (AS5, MS 5, MS73, and MS 285) in Figure 15, and samples also contained phylotypes highly similar to representatives of the genera Pseudomonas , Rhodoferax , and Clone libraries were constructed for both Archaea and Bacteria using primary enrichments of shale samples AS 71 and AS113 (Appendix C3). Bacterial clone libraries constructed for samples AS71 and AS113 contained 72 and 46 clones , respectively , as listed in Tables C3 -1 and C3- 2, respectively. Species richness and rarefaction from DOTUR (Appendix C3, Figures C3.1-3) indicate that clone sample diversity approached actual diversity. The bacterial library for AS71 had 30 OTUs (operational taxonomic units), out of 72 sequences at the 95% confidence level. The bacterial library for AS113 was less diverse, with 7 OTUs (out of 46 sequences) at the 95% confidence level. The two clone libraries represent statistically different populations based on a Unifrac analysis correlation coefficient of 0.001 < p < 0.01. Sequence length was typically between 380 and 320 bases in length, allowing genus level identification. Figure 16a shows the bacterial phylotypes occurring at a frequency of 2% or greater in the AS71 library. This sample had the highest number of SeRB based on the MPN results. Nearly two -thirds of the clones had sequences that best matched members of hydrocarbon- 125 Figure 16. Bacterial clone libraries for overburden samples members of the Acidoferrobacter genus, and the Fe- and S- reducing genera Desulfuromonas and Magnetobacter , represent another 20% of observed diversity. Less diversity is evident in the AS113 clone library (Figure 16b), with only 7 principal phylotypes representing the community. Most clones closely (> 97% identity ) matched the phylotopes of community more limited than the AS71 community, but the metabolisms of the microorganisms represented in AS113 are consistent with the dominantly hydrocarbon-oxidizing, Fe-reducing community identified for AS71. Of the phylotypes identified in the clone libraries, only Anaeromyxobacter is known to be a SeO 42- reducing organism. Interestingly , no Stenotrophomonas- like phylotypes were identified in the libraries, consistent with the results of the DGGE molecular work, but not the isolation work. Dechloromonas phylotypes were also not identified in the clone libraries. Results for the Archaeal library for AS113, which contained 35 clones , are provided in Appendix C3. The rarefaction curve is also provided as Figure C3.1 in Appendix C3. Creation of an Archaeal library for AS71 was unsuccessful due to low DNA yield. 127 Community Diversity in Saturated and Unsaturated Overburden Lithotype and moisture content are hypothesized to influence the microbial community composition and capacity for SeO 42- reduction. DGGE profiles were used to test this hypothesis by comparing changes in community diversity between lithotypes and groundwater samples from saturated backfill (Figure 14). This approach was taken to complement the isolation work by identifying microorganisms that were not readily cultivated. The DGGE banding patterns in the two groundwater samples were nearly identical and reflected less diversity than the unsaturated rock samples. There was considerable similarity between identified communities, however, and bands representing the Pseudomonas , Rhodoferax, and Dechloromonas genera were observed in both saturated and unsaturated sediments. DGGE patterns of the shale samples show a relatively consistent community in that lithotype , whereas the DGGE patterns for the mudstone and chert samples differ somewhat from the shales and from each other . Discussio n Culture dependent and independent techniques were used to characterize the SeO 42- reducing microbial populations present in backfill at three phosphate mine sites in S.E. Idaho. The study was undertaken because physical and geoch emical monitoring data indicate there are important differences between the overburden deposits at each location, which may influence the release of Se to the surrounding environment. 128 Subsurface Selenium Biogeochemistry Supports Potential for Se Reduction Groundwater chemistry at the Smoky Canyon Mine (GW11) , where SeRB numbers were lower, showed lower pH values and higher SeO 42-, SO 42- , NO 3-, and O 2 concentrations compared to conditions at the Dry Valley mine , where SeO 42- concentrations are below the Idaho groundwater standard of 0.050 mg/L. These data reflect the higher concentration of O 2 at the Smoky Canyon Mine, where increased SO 42- was measured, and decreased biological reduction of SeO 42- and NO 3- was indicated by the relatively higher concentrations of Se and lower numbers of SeRB. The probable importance of microbial reduction of SeO 42- in the Dry Valley Mine sediments under suboxic conditions is demonstrated by the comparison of live and killed cultures in batch reactors , where concurrent NO 3-, Fe3+ and Mn4+ reduction is evident (Figure 13). The Smoky Canyon m onitoring well GW11 is intermittently saturated with higher concentrations of O 2, while groundwater in the Dry Valley backfill, where concentrations of SO 42- , SeO 42-, and NO 3- are lower, demonstrates more consistently microaerophilic to anoxic conditions. This condition may be due to prior saturation during pit water discharge onto backfill in 1999 and 2000, but conditions have remained sub- to anoxic even though much of the upper backfill has drained to field capacity moisture content since that time [2]. Elevated concentrations of SO 42- at both locations suggest that while conditions are moderately reducing, they are too oxidizing to support si gnificant SO 42- reduction. Iron concentrations in both groundwater wells (<0.2 mg/L) are low relative to higher manganese concentrations (<0.5 mg/L). 129 Rock sampled from the Smoky Canyon backfill D and external A dumps has variable water content that is consistently below reporte d moisture retention capacities (Table 6) [3]. At the Enoch Valley Mine site, gas and moisture conditions fall between the partially aerobic, dominantly unsaturated conditions at the Smoky Canyon Mine and the suboxic, more saturated conditions at Dry Valley backfills . Core samples from the Enoch Valley Mine are also unsaturated, but generally have higher water content than the Smoky Canyon Mine samples . Oxygen is not detected in samples collected from below 30 feet of depth at the Enoch Valley Mine, in spite of the unsaturated character of these deposits, ref lecting the distinct manner in which the rock was dumped in individual lifts during facility construction. The locations sampled in this study thus offered a representative range of conditions in which to study changes in the SeRB microbial community within mined overburden under field conditions. The in situ monitoring data in Table 6 suggest that observed differences in SeO 42- concentrations between the Dry Valley and Smoky Canyon mines are more likely the result of variations in O 2 levels, moisture content, and lithology (e.g., Se, N and C content and material texture) than differences in temperature or pH , which show little difference between locations. These variables, which can be influenced by mine facility design, were used to further explore changes in microbial community numbers and diversity. A comparison of the estimated number of SeRB with the physical and chemical parameters of the samples shows that the greatest numbers of SeRB occur in shale or groundwater, where soluble Se and D OC contents are elevated and samples are saturated. Interestingly, measurements of O 2 within the drill hole annulus and/or bulk moisture 130 contents shown in Table 6 (e.g., at the macro scale) do not correspond directly with SeRB numbers. This is not surprising due to the fine-grained and tightly compacted nature of the hydrocarbon- rich shales, which have a greater capacity to develop anoxic conditions as a result of aerobic hydrocarbon metabolism within partially saturated pore spaces that would not be evident at the macro scale. Significant populations of SeRB were not evident in MPN tubes under aerobic conditions or in samples of chert or mudstone with lower moisture or water soluble organic carbon content, nor were they present in near- surface shales with either low moisture content or low total Se concentrations. As might be expected, greater numbers of SeRB colonize shales where the total Se concentration is higher. For several samples where the SeRB were present in elevated numbers relative to other samples (AS71, DS75, MS5, MS73, and MS285), the ratio of soluble to total Se was (0.03-0.15) reflecting possible microbial influences on net Se solubility . Identity of SeRB The phylotypes associated with the SeRB isolated from the majority of SeO 42- reducing enrichments were more than 99% identical to members of the Dechloromonas genus [ 41]. The Dechloromonas OTU's were most similar D. [43], D. hortensis [ 44],and Dechloromonas A-34, a novel organism that was isolated from the Smoky Canyon Mine shales (Childers, unpublished). All of the Dechloromonas isolates obtained in this study could respire SeO 42- (Childers, unpublished) and reduced soluble SeO 42- to Se0. Dechloromonads are rod- respiring facultative anaerobes that can couple the oxidation of short chain volatile fatty acids and simple dicarboxylic acids to the reduction 131 of (per)chlorate, O 2, and in some strains, NO 3- [45]. Until now, no dechloromonads have been shown to respire SeO 42-, although some species can respire SO 42- and NO 3-. The SeO 42--reducing Decholoromonas isolates obtained in this study did not grow with chlorate or perchlorate [hereafter referred to as (per)chlorate], indicating they cannot respire (per)chlorate and are physiologically distinct from all known Dechloromonas species isolated to date (Childers, in preparation). The majority of SeO 42--reducing Dechloromonas isolates obtained in this study are most closel y related to D. aromatica RCB which grows anaerobically by coupling the oxidation of benzene to nitrate or (per)chlorate, and has been shown to lbenzene, and xylene isomers electron acceptors [42, 46] . Similar aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, such as toluene, and anthracene were identified in methylene chloride extractions of shales from the Phosphoria Formation (Table 7) and may provide a substrate for the SeO 42- reducing dechloromonads presen t in these sediments. Organisms from the Dechloromonas genus were readily isolated and their 16S rRNA genes amplified from groundwater, and they were detected frequently in culture enrichments . They could not be isolated from the most dilute positive MPN cultures, were not identified in clone libraries, and occurred only as faint bands in DGGE analyses of rock samples, however. This suggests that they may be present in very low numbers in unsaturated rock , or alternatively, that the enr ichment and cultivation methods select for these organisms and misrepresent their relative dominance in the enrichment community (Figure 14). It also appears that the se dechloromonads thrive under saturated conditions, 132 as they seem to be more readily isolated from saturated sediment samples collected from groundwater monitoring wells , but were not enriched from samples from unsaturated environments. The second most frequently isolated SeRB was typically more than 99% identical to a Stenotrophomonas member, specifically S. maltophilia, and was also only found associated with groundwater rather than unsaturated shale. S. maltophilia can reduce SeO 42- and SeO 32- to Se0 during stationary phase under microaerophilic conditions; cells are thus not dependent on SeO 42- or SeO 32- for growth [ 47, 48]. S. maltophilia has also been shown to reduce SeO 42- in a mixed community of SeRB in coal mine tailing pond sediments [25], and was identified as a member of a benzene- degrading microbial consortium [ 49]. Interestingly, no Stenotrophomonas species were isolated from, or identified in the DGGE analysis of the most dilute positive MPNs . Member s of this genus were also not identified in the clone libraries suggesting that it, too, may not be numerically important in the rock samples . None of the other isolates obtained during this study exhibited SeO 42- reduction independently, under the conditions used in this study. For example, efforts to isolate individual SeRB from the most-dilute positive MPN culture for the AS71 and AS113 samples were unsuccessful (e.g., individual phylotypes similar to organisms known to be capable of reducing SeO 42- to Se0), yet members of the Rhodoferax and Cellulomonas genera and Actinobacteria were identified from these samples through cultivation and/or confirmed through comparison with known isolates using DGGE. For this reason, there seems to be additional potential for Se reduction at the community level which could not 133 be demonstrated here, potentially involving different organisms handling individual steps of the reduction from the SeO 42- to the Se0 form. Several Rahnella spp. were isolated and although these isolates did not demonstrate SeO 42- reduction, members of the Rahnella genus have been reported to reduce SeO 42- in sediments from the Nile Delta [50]. Rahnella may play a broader community role, in that several members of this genus facilitate phytoremediation of Cd, Pb, Zn, and U [ 51] and have potential to dissolve hydroxyapatite, a common phosphate mineral [ 52, 53] . Likewise, the Rhodoferax isolates from this study did not reduce SeO 42- although R. fermentans was identified as a SeO 42-- reducing microorganism in previous work at Smoky Canyon[ 26]. A mixed culture of one Rhodoferax and one Cellulomonas isolated from the most dilute AS113 MPN culture did show weak, late growth stage reduction of SeO 42- to Se0, but the SeO 42- reduction was weak compared to the SeO 42--reducing capacity of the original MPN culture from which the microorganisms were isolated . The potential capacity of Rhodoferax and/or Rahnella spp. to reduce SeO 42- to SeO 32-, coupled with reduction to insoluble forms by other isolated SeO 32--reducing genera such as Cellulomonas or Pseudomonas, should be further investigated to explain the inability to isolate an individual organism capable of reducing SeO 42- to Se0 in the most dilute MPN cultures. Anaeromyxobacter is another genus with members that are capable of community level Se reduction . Members of this genus are known to reduce SeO 42- [54], and this genus was identified in clone libraries for both shale samples in this study, but was not isolated or identified in DGGE work. 134 The highest numbers of SeRB were associated with hydrocarbon- rich shales, which suggests that SeRB may be capable of coupling the reduction of SeO 42- directly to the oxidation of complex hydrocarbons. Isolates grew on carbon extracted from the rock, which contained a mix of aliphatic and aromatic compounds of varying complexity, but each isolate has not been tested for growth independently on the individual compounds present in the extracts. However, none of the Dechloromonas isolates obtained as part of this study showed an ability to couple SeO 42- reduction with the oxidation of benzoate. Selenate- reducing isolates with strong similarity to the genera Dechloromonas, Stenotrophomonas,or Rahnella could not be isolated from the most-dilute positive MPN tubes of rock samples or identified in the clone libraries, indicating that these organisms are present in low numbers in samples of unsaturated rock but were selected for by the enrichment methods used in this study. The opposite is true for the groundwater samples, as all of the Dechloromonas, Stenotrophomonas and Rahnella isolates were obtained from groundwater sources. The DOTUR curves (Appendix A3) indicate that the clone libraries, while small, reasonably represent the observed variation in the bacterial community, but the 16S rRNA gene sequences for the SeO 42--reducing isolates are absent in the clone libraries. This supports the conclusion that the Se- reducing organisms are rare members of the overall microbial community, and that the reduction of Se is a relative ly minor part of the overall biogeochemical activity within the backfills. A previous study reporting on the isolation of SeRB within phosphate mine wastes in SE Idaho yielded results different from this study [27]. In the earlier study, no Dechloromonas representatives were obtained from phosphate overburden nor w ere any 135 identified in the DGGE analyses, although uncultivated Rhodocyclaceae were reported by Knotek- Smith [55]. Archived samples of overburden used in this previous study were obtained and several members of the Dechloromonas genus were successfully isolated from the material, indicating that fundamental differences in the techniques used to isolate SeRB are likely the reason for the discrepancy. Community Characteristics and Diversity Results of this study provide a broader understanding of the microbial ecology of these complex overburden deposits. Many of the sequences obtained for microbes isolated from groundwater or enriched rock samples were not SeRB. Phylotypes with a high degree of similarity to denitrifying and hydrocarbon -oxidizing, and Fe 3+or Mn4+- reducing organisms appear to dominate the microbial population of these variably saturated, phosphate overburden sediments. In the clone libraries, the only known SeO 42- -reducing ge nus that was detected was Anaeromyxobacter; the SeO 32- -reducing genus Geobacter was also identified. Sequences related to S -oxidizing and methanotrophic organisms were also detected in clone libraries. Conversely, phylotypes with high similarity to known SeO 42- - reducing organisms were more frequently identified in isolates and DGGE-isolated bands than in clone libraries, and were more common in saturated sediments and in unsaturated samples of shale. It is therefore likely that these phylotypes (and the organisms they represent) occur in relatively low abundance within the overall microbial community. Microbial phylotypes identified in this study indicate the presence of a mixture of aerobes and anaerobes, many closely related to microorganisms that can degrade 136 hydrocarbons. Degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and other naturally occurring hydrocarbon compounds present in the Meade Peak shale sediments, is most likely to be most efficient under aerobic conditi ons, but can be stimulated by NO 3- and Fe3+ or Mn4+ reduction under anaerobic conditions. Demand for O 2 during such degradation can be sufficient to create locally anaerobic zones within soils [ 56], and may explain the development of microscale anaerobiosis in shales located within relatively aerobic waste facilities. Several phylotypes similar to genera that are capable of aerobic or facultative degradation of hydrocarbons were identified. Sphingomonas [ 57], as well as Anaeromyxobacter and Brevundimonas [ 58], are heterotrophs and contain species capable of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation. Members of the genera Pseudomonas, Nocardioides, and Rhodoccoccus are similar to the phylotypes identified in this study are also known to degrade aromatic carbon aerobically [ 59, 60] . Of particular interest is that Polaromonas , a genus of aerobes in the Commamonadacae family, have high metal tolerance and the capacity for degrading a variety of hydrocarbons, ranging from alkanes to aromatic compounds, under a wide range of metal and salinity exposures [ 61]. Phylotypes identified in this study were highly similar (>99%) to a Polaromonas sp. isolated from a naphthalene contaminated soil sample [ 62, 63]. Members of the genus Anaeromyxobacter are known to oxidize reduced humic acids [6] and can concurrently reduce Se and Fe [64]. Some Variovorax spp. can degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons under aerobic or NO 3- reducing conditions at low 137 temperature [65]. Members of the Acidovorax and Pseudomonas genera were associated with aer obic benzene-degrading communities in a study of O 2 depleted groundwater [ 56] and Pseudorhodoferax spp. are also known hydrocarbon-degrading members of the Comamonadaceae family [66]. Of additional interest is the capacity of a comamonad, Rhodoferax f errireducens , to degrade benzoate under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, as well as its ability to reduce Fe3+ and NO 3- [67]. Hydrocarbon degradation is also fueled by Fe cycling in suboxic environments [68, 69]. to Fe-cycling in carbon- rich sediments [70-72] . Several of the Bacteria isolated from these phosphate overburden communities are strongly similar to organisms shown in published studies to couple hydrocarbon degradation to Fe- redox cycling and they are thus inferred to do so in these deposits. For example, Geobacter metallireducens was one of the first anaerobes shown to oxidize organic compounds using Fe 3+ as an electron acceptor [73], and perchlorate and NO 3- dependent re-oxidation of Fe2+ by two species of Dechloromonas [ 42] was shown to occur in anaerobic settings. Abiotic oxidation of Fe2+ by Mn4+ may also support this process [ 68], by resupplying Fe3+ for reduction by organisms similar to R. ferrireducens , a facultative Fe3+-reduce r highly similar to the phylotype identified in these sediments [40]. Other organisms similar to phylotypes identified in this study with capacity to reduce Fe3+ and Mn4+ include members of Desulfuromonas [ 74], Geobacter [ 75, 76], Rahnella and Anaeromyxobacter. Members of the genus Pelosinus are also known to reduce Fe3+ and 138 humic compounds [ 77, 78 ]. Members of the Acidobacteria and Acidovorax genera identified in the backfill are additional potential contributors to Fe2+ oxidation [ 79]. The community analysis suggested additional cycling of S, N, and methane. Both S-oxidizing and - reducing genera were identified in clone Acidoferrobacteria, Desulfuromonas, and Candidatus Magnetobacter oxidation of organic ) were also identified in the clone libraries. These Bacteria are potentially important members of the community in sulfide -bearing sediments which exhibit elevated levels of NO 3- and SO 42- due to NO 3- compounds used in blasting and the oxidation of sulfide minerals in the mining environment. Communities with simila r microbial diversity and ecology have been described in other low temperature subsurface, hydrocarbon- influenced environments. A consortium comprised of Acidovorax , Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas , and Variovorax species was reported aerobic and nitrate-reducing conditions in soils where naphthalene, phenanthrene, and fluorene were degraded [ 65]. Phylotypes with a high degree of similarity to Polaromonas spp. were identified with R. ferrireducens in a mixed consortium of aerobic and anaerobic benzene-degrading organisms in a groundwater setting [80]. Polaromonas spp. were also present with Acidobacterium and Sphingomonas organisms in a benzene-degrading soil consortium [ 81]. In an O 2-depleted groundwater, Acidovorax , Pseudomonas , and Rhodococcus spp. varied in relative abundance based on changes in O 2 availability [56]. An Acidovorax sp. was also identified as a member of a benzene-oxidizing, chlorate-reducing consortium 139 with Mesorhizobia and Dechloromonas spp. [ 49]. These studies support the probable role of representatives of the Acidovorax, Polaromonas, Sphingomonas , and Variovorax genera aerobic/anaerobic conditions in subsurface backfills in S.E. Idaho.

Idaho Phosphate Resource area can work together to reduce SeO 42- under Fe3+, Mn4+, and NO 3--reducing conditions , using available native hydrocarbon and other available electron donors. With variable O2 and moisture conditions within the mined overburden, there are opportunities for both aerobic and anaerobic degradation of complex shale hydrocarbons, as suggested by the diversity of organisms identified. Degradation of complex shale hydrocarbons by aerob ic members of the community may decrease available O 2, thus creating conditions favorable for SeO 42- reduction by species of Dechloromonas and Stenotrophomonas , and perhaps other SeRB such as Cellulomonas and Rahnella spp. The most favorable conditions appear to be in saturated or moist environments (close to field capacity) where sufficient soluble Se and organic C are available to support growth of SeRB. Opportunities to extend this understanding of biogeochemistry in subsurface phosphate overburden deposits include further evaluation of community level heterotrophic SeO 42- reduction and evaluation of which native hydrocarbon compounds are being consumed by SeRB in removing Se from solution, as well as controlled studies of how the relative availability of NO 3- and O 2 140 affects the reliability of SeRB activity . Field scale monitoring of biogeochemistry and microbial community response to changes in O2 availability that result from operational changes in mine rock placement and water management is needed to demonstrate how in situ microbial reduction of Se perform s at the field scale. Based on the results of this study, an effective operational application of in situ microbial source control of Se in backfilled phosphate overburden will need to consider the influence of O 2 and NO 3- concentration , lithology, and water availability on the activity of SeRB, as well as the influence of Fe2+ on the native hydrocarbon degrading community.

IDAHO Lisa Bithell Kirk, Jared J. Bozeman, Brandy D. Stewart, Robin Gerlach and Brent M. Peyton Center for Biofilm Engineering, Montana State University, Bozeman MT ABSTRACT Selenate (SeO 42-) reduction by native microbes, using naturally -occurring carbon in chert and shale phosphate overburden, has been studied under temperature, oxygen, and litholog ical conditions representative of subsurface backfills in S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area. Se lenate reduction is a biotic process, wherein SeO 42- is reduced when trace oxygen (O 2) and nitrate (NO 3-) in saturated, microaerophilic sediments is consumed by aerobic and denitrifying microbial activity . The rate and biogeochemical lithology and t emperature dependent reduction of SeO to selenite (SeO 32-) and elemental Se ( Se0) occurred more rapidly in chert, while SeO 42- was reduced to selenomethionine, Se0 and selenide minerals more slowly in shale. Concurrent hydrocarbon oxidation coupled to Fe3+, Mn4+, and NO 3- reduction was observed, with less than 40% of the available dissolved organic carb on used during the reduction process . Shifts in the community of microbes were observed , from an initial consortium comprised of the genera Dechloromonas , Rhodoferax, Brevundimonas, and Sphingomonas with the genera Ralstonia and Rahnella. T hese results explain field -scale observations of differential Se reduction at different mine site locations due to changes in moisture and oxygen availability, and suggest that design of facilities to achieve in situ Se stabilization using native microbes and carbon is possible through management of water, rock, and gas flux. 153 Introduction Selenium (Se) release from mine waste may impact water quality and has potential to threaten aquatic ecosystems [1]. Mobility and toxicity depend upon Se speciation in response to complex biogeochemically -driven redox processes [ 2, 3]. Mine waste deposits host diverse communities of microbes known to influence metal, s ulfur (S)[4], and nitrogen (N) geochemistry [5]. B iofilms developed on mineral surfaces within these dep osits afford mixed microbial communitie s opportunities to manage water, carbon (C), nutrient, and oxygen (O2) budgets [ 6-10]. The low solubility of Se under moderately reducing conditions has raised broad interest in microbial reduction of Se for bioremediation purposes [ 11, 12], but intentional development of biogeochemical conditions that foster Se reduction and attenuation within engineered mine waste facilitie s remains relatively unexplored . This study explores the biogeochemistry , rate, and products of Se reduction by a native consortium of microbes, under saturated microaerophilic conditions, using naturally available C in mined phosphate overburden facilities in S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area. Improved understanding of the microbial ecology of in situ Se reduction can guide future efforts to design facilities for in situ Se source control. Selenium exists in four major oxidation states , Se(VI), Se( IV), Se(0), and Se(- II) [13]. It substitutes for S in a variety of minerals, such as pyrite (Fe(Se-II, S-II)2 ) and gypsum, Ca(SeVIO4, SO 4).2H 2O, which have potential to release Se when oxidized or leached [14]. Reduced Se minerals can be oxidized through biotic or abiotic processes [15-17]. U nder acidic conditions, Se oxyanions are readily sorbed to highly protonated 154 surfaces of iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) 18-23], aluminum SeO 42-) attenuated ( SeO 32-) [27, 28]. Alkaline and oxidized mine waste thus release SeO 42- oxyanions that persist in solution and may bioaccumulate [ 1]. Kinetic barriers to abiotic SeO 42- reduction create opportunities for its microbial respiration [29], while other organisms are known to reduce or methylate SeO 32- for detoxification purposes [ 30]. Microbial reduction of soluble and potentially toxic SeO 42- and SeO 32- to the less soluble Se0 and Se2- minerals limits Se mobility and bioavailability [31]. -Se compounds, including selenocysteine , result from Se assimilation [32], and a variety of methylated compounds are produced via detoxification pathways [ 33, 34]. Facultative or anaerobic Se -reducing microbes range from mesophil ic to extremophil ic Bacteria and Archaea that are adapted to extremes of pH, salinity, or temperature [35, 36]. S ome can reduce SeO 42- fully to Se0, while others are capable only of reducing SeO 42- to SeO 32- or SeO 32- to Se2-. Reduction of soluble oxyanions to the most reduced Se (0) or Se (-II) oxidation state s can thus depend on community- level interactions between multiple organisms [37]. The ecology of microbial communities that reduce Se in mine waste is likely to be influenced by O2 and C availability, as well as cycling of N, S, Fe, and Mn. Groundwater monitor ed in backfilled sediments at two S .E. Idaho mines that produce phosphate from the Permian Phosphoria Formation (Fig ure 17), Dry Valley Mine (well GW7D2a) and Smoky Canyon Mine (well GW11) , have significantly different soluble Se concentration s. This is despite the fact that both wells were completed in mixed 155 Figure 17. Map showing drill hole and monitoring well sampling locations at the Agrium Dry Valley and Simplot Smoky Canyon Mines, S.E. Idaho. overburden that was mined from the same geologic formation using similar methods [38]. Concentrations of Se in Ca-HCO 3-SO 4 groundwater at the Dry Valley Mine, where seleniferous rock is saturated in deep backfill, have remained at or below the Idaho groundwater standard of 0.05 mg/L for more than 10 years, suggesting an ongoing process of microbial Se reduction . This is in contrast to concentrations as high as 1 mg/L measured in variably saturated, aerated backfill at the Smoky Canyon Mine. H ighly carbonaceous, Se -enriched black shale and a clay -rich, Fe -oxide bearing chert are the dominant overburden litho types mined in the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area , with 156 lesser amounts of mudstone. T he relative percentage of each lithology varies within randomly placed backfilled overburden. Objectives In Chapter 4, a consortium of native microbes with potential for SeO 42- reduction in subsurface mine waste at three S.E. Idaho phosphate mines was identified and enumerated under a range of representative O 2, moisture, and lithology conditions using samples of saturated and unsaturated overburden. A most probable number (MPN) method was used to estimate the number of SeO 42--reducing bacteria (SeRB) in groundwater, chert, shale, and mudstone s amples, and changes in microbial diversity as a function of lithotype and moisture conditions were compared using clone libraries and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The most favorable conditions for Se reduction appear to be in shale, under saturated or moist conditions (close to field capacity) where sufficient soluble Se and organic C is available to support higher numbers of SeRB. Results reported in Chapter 4 for Se reduction in mixed overburden suggest that variable O 2 and moisture conditions within the mined overburden create opportunities for both aerobic and anaerobic de gradation of complex shale hydrocarbon, as reflected by the diversity of identified hydrocarbon- degrading organisms. Results also indicate that SeRB reduce SeO 42- using naturally- occurring C compounds under Fe3+, Mn4+, and NO 3- reducing conditions . It is proposed that degradation of complex shale hydrocarbons by aerobic members of the community decreases available O2, thus creating conditions 157 favorable for SeO 42- reduction by the facultative anaerobes identified in Chapter 4 including Dechloromonas spp. and Stenotrophomonas spp., and perhaps other heterotrophic SeRB. To explain the observed differences in soluble Se concentrations at the Dry Valley and Smoky Canyon mines, we investigate d the rate and extent of Se reduction in saturated batch reactors, under variable temperature and litholog ical conditions with limited O2. These experiments address the hypotheses that (1) Se reduction observed in the sediments at the Dry Valley Mine is microbial and not abiotic; (2) reduction is most efficient at elevated temperature after O2 is depleted; (3) changes in pH, dissolved organic carbon ( DOC ), and dissolved NO 3-, SO 42-, total Mn, and total Fe in chert and shale mine waste are associated with the observed reduction, and (4) creating moist and microaerophilic conditions in sediments will promote Se reduction by native microbes using naturally available C and potentially, other available electron donors. Experimental Samples of overburden and groundwater were collected from the Dry Valley and Smoky Canyon mines (Figure 17) and analyzed to describe the mineralogy, metal chemistry, soluble constituents, and C speciation of the materials used to construct reactors (supplement, Tables S1 to S4). Autoclaved samples of the dominant chert and shale lithologies collected from backfill were inoculated with live groundwater cultures from the Dry Valley and Smoky Canyon mines in s aturated batch reactors . The rate and extent of SeO 42- reduction (using naturally-occurring hydrocarbon compounds and other available electron donors ) were measured experimentally under the temperature and 158 lithologic substrate conditions observed during in situ monitoring. Changes in dissolved O2 and DOC , pH, and soluble NO 3-, SO 42-, total Fe, and total Mn were measured at key points during the reduction process, including lag, initial reduction, mid-reduction, and post-reduction phases . Changes in Se mineralogy resulting from the monitored reduction process were studied using synchrotron x- ray diffraction (S- XRD) and bulk x- ray adsorption near edge spectroscopy ( XANES ). The response of the microbial community associated with SeO 42- reduction was characterized using DGGE . Saturated Batch Reactor Rate Experiments . Batch reactors were constructed in triplicate using 30 g of sterilized sub-2 mm shale and chert with 30 mL of sterile deionized water in 250 mL glass serum bottles. The grain size of the sub-2 mm material is described in Appendix A -2. Rock was autoclaved (steam sterilized 45 min at 121\u00b0C at a minimum of 15 psi), rested for 48 hours, and re- autoclaved to kill spore-forming organisms prior to reactor construction. A sub-sample of live groundwater was also autoclaved for use in the sterile control experiment. Saturated sediment was stirred in the presence of O2 for 12 hours to dissolve any existing oxidation products present in the waste rock, which result from weathering under the aerobic conditions known to exist within near surface portions of mine waste. The saturated sediment was then then inoculated with a consortium of native microbes through the addition of turbid site groundwater to bring the reactor to full volume (using fresh and autoclaved groundwater to create a live and killed control reactor, respectively ). The sealed bottles were degassed with 0.2 \u00b5m filter -sterilized ultra -pure N 2 gas for 1 hour to remove most of the O 2. Each reactor was spiked with Na2SeO 4 stock solution to a target 159 concentration of 10 mg/L Se as SeO 42- and incubated at room temperature (between 20 and 25\u00b0C) and 10\u00b0C under dark conditions. The actual starting concentration varied in response to Se release from the rock in each reactor . No C was added as electron donor to the hydrocarbon that was naturally present in the rock and groundwater . Samples of mixed water and sediment were collected immediately using a N 2 purged syringe, and every 12 hours until Se reduction was complete (10 to 14 days ). Oxygen and pH were measured in the aqueous phase at the beginning, middle, and end of each experiment, using a Hach AQ4 dissolved O 2 meter (Loveland, CO) and an Acumet AB15 pH meter with a probe model no. 13-620- AP (Cole Parmer). Samples were centri fuged at 13,000x g to remove solids. The supernatant and the solid s were separated and frozen for subsequent analysis including total Se, Fe, and Mn by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Mass Spectroscopy (MS ); NO 3- , SO 42-, PO 43-, SeO 42-, and SeO 32- by ion chromatography (IC); and analysis of SeO 42- and SeO 32- at lower detection limits , together with SeC and SeM , by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC -ICP-MS). Protein content was measured at select time steps to track changes in biomass, using the Coomassie method [ 39]. Aqueous samples were also collected following centrifugation to remove solids and were preserved in glass at pH < 2 using phosphoric acid for analysis of DOC and total N. Additionally, s amples of sediment were collected at multiple time steps for DNA extraction and mineralog ical analysis . ICP-MS Analysis of Total Se, Fe, and Mn Co ncentrations : Samples were diluted 1:500 in 1% HNO 3 and 0.5% HCl for measurement of total Se, Fe, and Mn by direct 160 injection ICP-MS ( Agilent 7500ce ) following EPA method 200.8 [ Total Se was determined with the hydrogen- gas collisio n cell, to minimize analytical interferences, while Fe and Mn were measured directly without the collision cell . Limits of detection varied slightly within the analytical runs, but were generally 2 \u00b5g/L for Se, 1 \u00b5g/L for Fe, and 1 \u00b5g/L for Mn. IC Analysis of NO 3-, SO 42-, PO 43-, SeO 42-, SeO 32: Anion concentrations were measured by IC using a Dionex instrument with an IonPac AS -9-HC (4 x 250 mM) anion column and a CD 20 detector. Samples (25 \u00b5L) were injected into an 11 mM Na 2CO 3 mobile phase flowing at 0.9 mL/min , at full strength to measure low concentrations of SeO 42- and SeO 32-, and diluted 25X with deionized water to measure higher concentrations of SO 42- and NO 3-. Se Speciation by Hamilton PRPX -100 PEEK anion column with a pH 4.8, 5 mM ammonium citrate mobile phase modified to 2% methanol by weight [ 41]. The mobile phase was delivered isocratically at 1 ml/min for analysis using an Agilent 7500ce ICP-MS to quantify 78Se using time resolved analysis with a plasma argon ( Ar) flow of 15 L/min. DOC and T otal N Analyses : DOC and total N were measured using a Shimadzu TOC -V CSN Carbon/Nitrogen Analyzer (Kyoto, Japan). DOC was measured by standard method 5310 (non-dispersive infrared CO 2 detector) following acidification and two minutes of sparging with zero air (air with less than 0.1 ppm hydrocarbon). T otal N was measured using standard method 4500 [ 42] following treatment with ozone. 161 Protein Assays : Protein was extracted follo wing 0.5 N NaOH digestion for 10 min at 90 \u00b0C, foll owed by neutralization with HCl. Digest ed samples were assayed using the Pierce Plus Coomassie protein assay method (Pierce no. 23236) . Concentrations were measured by absorption at 630 nm using a Biotek Synergy HT multidata microplate reader . Replicate protein assays were attempted using the Pierce Compat-Able Protein assay (Pierce No. 23215) to remove interferences . For comparison, protein measurements were also made using a Qbit fluorimeter with the NanoOrange\u00ae Protein Quantitation kit. XANES and S -XRD of Se Minerals : Se x -ray absorption spectra (XAS) were collected on beamline 4 -1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory using published methods [ 43]. Samples were deposited on membranes and sealed with Kapton polyimide film to minimize oxidation. A liquid N 2-cooled Si (220) monochromator was used for energy selection , and higher order harmonics were rejected by detuning 30%. Fluorescence spectra were collected with a Lytle detector for Se. Extended X -ray fine structure (EXAFS) and XANES spectral scans were averaged, with the pre- and post- edge subtracted using SixPACK (Webb, 2005). Synchrotron -based XRD data were collected at SRL on beamline 11 -3 and calibrated with lanthanum hexaboride and used to confirm the presence of species identified based on near -edge energy thresholds. DNA, PCR, DGGE, and Sequencing : Nucleic acids were extracted from 1 g sediment samples taken from enrichment microcosms , or frozen samples of soil and groundwater, using the Power Soil DNA Isolation Kit TM (Mo Bio). The method was modified by first incubating 1 g of sediment in 20% SDS at 70oC for 1 hour, followed by 20 minute s in a vortex mixer . After vortexing, the entire sample was used for the 162 extraction of nucleic acids as detailed in the protocol provided by the manufacturer. PCR was performed on extracts to amplify 16S rRNA genes using a nested approach. Initially, 10 cycles were run using primers 1070F the initial PCR were diluted 1:10 and used as template in a 30 cycle PCR using 1070F and 1392R with a 40 base GC clamp . Reactions (50 \u00b5 l) contained template (2 L ea), PCR Mastercycler Gradient thermocycler. Conditions included denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 10 or 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 45sec, 50\u00b0C for 45 sec, 72\u00b0C for 45 sec, and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min . Samples of 12% acrylamide gels containing a 50-60% urea-formamide gradient at 70 V and 60\u00b0C for 20 hours. Gel electrophoresis was run using a DGGE-2401 system manufactured by CBS Scientific \u00ae, based on the general method described by Muyzer et al. [45]. Gels were stained with SYBR Gold and visualized under UV light. Samples were compared with a ladder comprised of DNA from known isolates, and individual bands of interest not pr esent in the ladder were excised from the gel, resuspended in 15 \u00b5L of nuclease- free water, and allowed to diffuse from the gel overnight at 60\u00b0C . Samples were mixed and acrylamide was pelleted by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was removed, diluted 1:10 in nuclease free water, and used as template in a 30 cycle PCR using primers 1070F and 1392R as described above. PCR products were purified using a Wizard SV Gel and PCR 163 Cleanup System (Promega) and quantified using a Qbit fluorimeter (Invitrogen). Samples were submitted to the Molecular Research Core Facility at Idaho State University for sequencing using an Applied Biosystems \u00ae 3130XL Genetic Analyzer. BLAST was used to query resulting sequences against the GenBank database [46]. Results and Discussion Changes in Se, NO 3-, Fe, Mn, and SO 42- concentrations, and in the associated microbial community, as well as the minerals produced as a result of Se reduction , are described below . These experiments were conducted in suboxic, saturated chert and shale batch reactors at two temperatures using s amples from two mine sites . Se Reduction in Batch Reactors Figure 18a and b show results of saturated batch Se reduction rate experiments run at the field relevant temperature of 10\u00b0C and room temperature (between 20 and 25\u00b0C), using rock and groundwater from the Dry Valley and Smoky Canyon mines . Supporting data are provided as supplemental information in Appendix D , as Tables D1 .1 and D1.2 for Dry Valley and D2.1 and D2.2 for Smoky Canyon; analytical data supporting these tables are provided on the accompanying CD. Rate experiments were also run using mixed shale, chert, and mudstone (run -of-mine) samples from both mine sites, which show results that reflect the combined influence of the dominant chert and 164 Figure 18 .

Values are averages ( n=3), and error bars represent \u00b1 1 standard deviation. 165 shale lithologies ; these results are presented in Chapter 4, with supporting data presented in Appendix D. Figure 18a shows total dissolved Se measured in live and killed control experiments for both shale and chert from the Dry Valley Mine. Results are given as the average, +/ - the standard deviation, of three experimental replicates. Comparable trends in reduction are shown for shale and chert from the Smoky Canyon Mine in Figure 18b. Comparison with killed controls for these experiments shows that reduction did not occ ur under abiotic conditions in the reactors. In fact, dissolved Se concentrations increased in killed controls initially, above the spiked Se concentration of 10 mg/L, presumably due to abiotic oxidation of reduced Se- bearing sulfide minerals by residual O 2 or, following O 2 depletion, by NO 3-. Continued dissolution of Se from mineral surfaces following closure and degassing of the r eactors is also a possibility. This was less pronounced in live reactors, presumably due to biotic consumption of the availabl e O 2 and NO 3-. Following a temperature -dependent lag phase, relatively rapid, near- complete reduction of soluble SeO 42- was observed at the rates shown in Table 10. These rates were calculated by linear best fit to the steepest part of the reduction curve for each microcosm, using the data between the inflection point and the point at which concentrations become asymptotic at low concentration. In most cases, Se concentration was observed to increase slightly prior to the onset of reduction. There was a shorter lag time prior to initiation of Se reduction in the 10\u00b0C microcosms in samples from the Smoky Canyon Mine compared to those from the Dry Valley Mine (Figure 18) . In samples from the Dry Valley Mine, Se reduction began sooner and proceeded more 166 Table 10 . Dry Valley and Smoky Canyon mines, Se reduction rates. Rate of Se Reduction (Average (N=3) \u00b1 std dev , \u00b5g Mine Reactor \u00b0C Chert Shale Dry Valley 10 \u00b0C 6.7 \u00b1 1.6 3.0 \u00b1 0.17 Dry Valley 25 \u00b0C 10.3 \u00b1 0.3 6.3 \u00b1 1.09 Smoky Canyon 10\u00b0C 4.3 \u00b1 1 4.3 \u00b1 0.7 Smoky Canyon 25\u00b0C 6.0 \u00b1 1.4 5.9 \u00b1 0.5 rapidly in the chert than in shale regardless of incubation temperature. This is in contrast to the Smoky Canyon Mine where the rate of Se reduction in chert was very similar to that measure in shale. Unfortunately, monitoring well GW11, which produced the groundwater used to inoculate the Smoky Canyon reactor, was buried due to subsequent mine development, and it was not possible to repeat the experiment to verify the similarity in rate between lithotypes. It is likely that th e more rapid Se removal in the experiments using chert from the Dry Valley Mine resulted from rapid sorption of SeO 32- onto clay a nd/or Fe oxide mineral surfaces within the fine -grain ed, muddy matrix of the chert. This hypothesis is supported by mineralogical analyses reported below . Se Speciation : Measurable concentrations of SeO 32- were detected by IC (Tables D2-1 and D2-2, Appendix D2) mid -reduction in all reactors , except the 25\u00b0C chert reactor, where reduction proceeded very quickly. S elect Dry Valley Mine samples were re-analyzed by HPLC -ICP-MS to more accurately measure SeO 42-, SeC (C3H7NO 2Se), and SeM (C 5H11NO 2Se) (Table 1 1). Unfortunately, the archived Smoky Canyon samples could not be re-analyzed with this method as they were beyond their holding time for volatile organo- Se compounds by the time the HPLC -ICP-MS analytical 167 capability became available, and the experiment could not be repeated following burial of the GW -11 well. The HPLC -ICP-MS results (Table 1 1) show that reduction of SeO 42- to SeO 32- was slower in shale than in chert, and was slower at 10\u00b0C than 25\u00b0C . Selenite was , not surprisingly, more efficiently removed from solution at higher temperatures, regardless of lithology. Measured SeC , an amino acid, was evident during Se reduction; this was most evident in the 10\u00b0C reactors. An increase in concentration of SeC reflects an assimilation of Se by bacteria, which appeared to increase under colder temperatures. The reason for this difference is not clear, but these data suggest that intracellular reduction may be favored at low temperatures. The measurement of SeC in supernatant solutions re flects the release of intracellular SeC, perhaps the result of detoxification or cell decomposition. Selenomethionine was observed at only one time step in one of the 1\u00b0C shale reactors, mid to late in reduction, along with unidentified organo- Se peaks that did not match standards included in our method. Chasteen and Bentley suggest that such results may indicate the methylation of Se and attributed accumulation of alkylation products to a toxicity response [ 34]. Such toxicity has been associated with limited capacity for Se reduction within a closed system [47]. The total mass of Se detected by HPLC -ICP-MS analyses from the Dry Valley Mine (Table 11) agrees reasonably well with the total Se analyses by ICP -MS (Figures 18 and 20, and Appendix D), with the dominant measured species being SeO 42-. Selenite was measured as a transient reduction product at much lower concentrations than SeO 42-; it is likely to have lower solubility due to its greater potential for sorption. These 168 Table 11 . HPLC -ICP-MS data showing Se speciation for Dry Valley Mine chert and shale reactors at key time steps detection. findings point to temperature-dependent shifts in metabolic pathway, but are not completely conclusive. Unfortunately, due to potential loss of volatile compounds during freezing and thawing of stored samples, it was not possible to confidently reproduce these results with archived reactor samples. Analyses of organo -Se compounds should be repeated with fresh samples to confirm the differential production of organo- Se compounds between lithology and temperature treatments. 169 Major Ion Chemistry During Se Reduction . Concentrations of SO 42- and PO 43-, were measured, as well as pH and dissolved O 2, for samples collected at key time steps (lag, inflection, reduction, end of reduction), and are summarized in Table D2.1 of Appendix D2. Oxygen was initially sparged to low levels with N 2 gas (<1 mg/L) , and any residual was subsequently consumed ( biotically and abiotically ), based on declining concentration s observed in both live and killed control reactors (Figure 19). A temperature-dependent lag time of varying duration was observed in live reactors, which corresponds with consumption of O 2 and some NO 3- after SeO 42- reduction was observed. Consumption of O 2 prior to denitrification, followed by metal/metalloid reduction, is typical in microaerophilic anaerobic metabolism by facultative microbes [48]. Nitrate concentrati ons decreased in all reactors following depletion of O 2 concentrations to < 0.3 mg/L and initiation of SeO 42- reduction, while SO 42- was constant or increased slightly. Unfortunately, because O 2 and NO 3- were not measured for all time steps, it is not possible to separate the influence of the two potential inhibitors to SeO 42- reduction. Measured pH remained relatively constant in live reactors, but dropped (as much as 0.5 pH units) in killed controls, pe rhaps reflecting generation of acid by oxidation. Surprisingly, for rock mined from phosphate deposits, soluble PO 43- was low and detected infrequently (1 mg/L detection limit) . Redox- sensitive parameters including NO 3- , Fe, Mn and Se are compared by temperature for laboratory kinetic experiments 170 Figure 19.

Experiments were conducted until Se reduction was complete, thus the length of the 10 and 25\u00b0C experiments varied. 171 using Dry Valley Mine samples in Figure 19 and Smoky Canyon Mine samples in Figure 20. Iron and Manganese During Se Reduction Observed increases in Fe, and to a lesser extent, Mn concentration during Se reduction in the Dry Va lley and Smoky Canyon mine reactors (Figures 19 and 20) support the hypothesis that Fe and Mn reduction is coupled to hydrocarbon degradation by members of the native microbial community. Concentrations of dissolved Fe shown in Figure 19a, which at pH 7 is most likely Fe 2+, rise as O 2 and NO 3- concentrations drop within the reactors. The dissolved Fe maintains a constant concentration around 120 mg/L throughout the period of Se reduction in the Dry Valley reactor , and then appears to drop at the end of the Se reduction process. The cause and timing of this change is unclear from available data, but this may reflect precipitation of FeSe 2 as selenide is produced, consistent with mineralogy analyses presented below. As SO 42- concentrations were constant in the reactors (see values reported in Appendix D2), it is unlikely that precipitation of pyrite (FeS 2) occurred, and no iron sulfide was identified in mineralogical analyses. A similar increase in dissolved Fe concentration was observed in the Dry Valley Min e 25\u00b0C experiment; although the resulting dissolved Fe concentration was considerably lower than that measured in the 10\u00b0C microcosm. The lower concentration may reflect a shift in microbial community structure at different incubation temperatures. No subs equent decline in Fe concentration was observed at 25\u00b0 C, but the experiment was shorter in duration, having been terminated at 180 hours following reduction of the 172 Figure 20 .

If the experiment had been carried out to 250 hours, the same drop in dissolved Fe concentration might have been observed . The observed increase in dissolved Fe is potentially due to the concurrent biological reduction of Fe. Genera known for Fe reduction capability, such as Rhodoferax, have been consistently identified with the hydrocarbon-degrading and heterotrophic SeO 4- reducing bacteria isolated during this study (Chapter 4). Interesting, members of Rhodoferax do not themselves have the demonstrated capability to reduce Se (this study; also, [49, 50]). Iron reduction is commonly associated with hydrocarbon degradation in suboxic environments, how ever [51, 52]. It is also possible that some of the observed Fe release results from redox reaction of the SeO 32- /HSeO 3- with primary FeS 2, especially in the Meade Peak shale, resulting in the formation of Se0 and the release of SO 42- and Fe2+ similar to results reported by Kang et al. [53] and Naveau et al. [54]. Although the data for Mn show a less dramatic increase in concentration than the Fe, a substantial in concentration was observed in both the chert and shale reactors , once O2 was depleted, especially in the Smoky Canyon Mine data. There were larger differences in the di ssolved Mn concentrations between shale and chert in the reactor experiments using Dry Valley Mine samples than were observed with Smoky Canyon Mine samples. This may reflect differences in the Mn -oxidizing microbial communities between the two mine sites or local differences in mineralogy . The occurrence of soluble Mn with low concentrations of Fe under micro-aerophilic, denitrifying conditions (such as those observed in early time steps in the reactors) are consistent with groundwater 174 chemistry monitored at GW7D and GW11 (Table S5-2). The redox chemistry of Mn in sedimentary pore water is complex, with potential for the intermediate Mn3+ to serve as both oxidant and reductant [ 55-57]. R apid cycling between Mn4+ likely occurs in suboxic sediments at redox boundaries similar to those studied in the backfill environment[ 58], with consequences for the redox cycling of Fe, and potentially Se [ 59, 60]. Such changes potentially affect the oxidation state and solubility of Fe and may explain the lo w concentrations of dissolved Fe late in the experiments (e.g., as Mn 4+ is reduced, Fe2+ is reoxidized, promoting the precipitation of iron oxide minerals). Recognizing that the rapid cycling of Fe drives denitrification and hydrocarbon degradation in suboxic subsurface systems [ 61, 62], it is possible that microbially mediated, reactive green -rust minerals develop on a transient basis, promoting the abiotic reduction of Se within the suboxic sedimentary environment. Nitrogen Concentration During Se Reduction : Nitrate and total nitrogen (N) concentrations are plotted in Figures 1 9 and 20 for the reactors from the Dry Valley and Smoky Canyon mines , respectively . Although NO 3- concentrations decreased during the lag phase, it was not completely removed from all reactors, and was observed to increase mid red uction phase in some reactors. Total N was observed to increase mid -reduction phase in all reactors. Interestingly , these data suggest that either a fraction of the NO 3- persist s in some reactors or is produced via re-oxidation of reduced N concentrations (2.5 mg/L ) mid -reduction (e.g., t= 90 to 188 hours in Smoky Canyon ). Results of the rate experiments indicate that NO 3- was reduced at the same time that SeO 42- was reduced to SeO 32-, but because the reactors rely on a mixed community of microbes for biological 175 reduction, it is not clear whether this was co -metabolism or ongoing NO 3- reduction that occurred in parallel with SeO 42- reduction (Table 1 1). The se results suggest that for these systems, NO 3- does not need to be completely reduced prior to the onset of SeO 42- reduction. The extent to which the persistence of NO 3- in the reactors was driven by re-oxidation of reduced N (such as NO 2- or NH 4+) cannot be addressed with available data, but the identification of abundant ammonia-oxidizing Archaea , specifically Nitrosphaera and Nitrospumilus, in groundwater (data not presented here) suggest that this is possible. In all of the Dry Valley Mine reactors, total N was observed to peak mid-reduction phase (Figure 21), but not in the killed controls (data not shown). Interestingly, total N shows a somewhat different pattern of increase in the Smoky Canyon Mine reactors, with total N increasing over time. In order to obtain sufficient volume to measure total N, the replicate reactor samples were composited, so it is not possible to report error for these measurements, and it is therefore difficult to be confident in the limited total N results. These data suggest a more complex N -cycle, with the possible decomposition of N-containing compounds (e.g., proteins) formed during the period of greatest Fe and Mn reduction. Preliminary analyses of volatile hydro carbon compounds that were measured by HS -SPME -GCMS for a select number of samples indicated that some of the compounds detected in the headspace were nitrogenous, but this analysis was only possible for a limited number of samples and provided only qualitativ e data (Table S 5-5; Appendix E). Alternatively, a change in N fixation during the reduction process may be involved. The fact that Se reduction can proceed in spite of 176 Figure 2 1. Dissolved organic carbon concentration (mg/L) in rate reactors, for composi ted sample (n=3) of each lithotype. Numbers above bars indicate time of sampling (in hours). 0 128 2720 128 2720 54 1880 54 Shale177 the presence of soluble N, and NO 3- in particular, is significant, given its recognized importance as a potential inhibitor of SeO 42- . Dissolved Organic Carbon during Se Reduction Figure 2 2 shows changes in DOC for the Dry Valley and Smoky Canyon mine reactors, respectively. These samples were composites of water from the replicate reactors (e.g., the sample identified as 10 DCL is a composite of samples from Dry Valley Mine Live Chert reactors 1, 2, and 3 at 10\u00b0C). In most reactors, a portion of the available DOC was consumed during the reduction process, but less than 40% of native DOC is shown to be consumed in live reactors; no C was consumed in killed controls, indicating biological consumption of the available C compounds. Evidence of lower DOC following reduction in the rate reactor was also observed in the qualitative SPME data (Table S 5-5). Further, an overall shift from complex to simpler hydrocarbon comp ounds is suggested by the SPME results, as the relative proportion of high molecular weight compounds (e.g., C> 15) measured in the head space was lower for samples of water taken from reactors at the end of the reduction process . The molar ratio of Fe to Se in solution during peak reduction increased by as much as two orders of magnitude in the Dry Valley experiments , with somewhat lower Mn to Se ratios, depending upon mine site and temperature (calculations provided in Appendix D1 on CD). This indicates that a much greater mass of Fe and Mn is reduced than Se in the reactors. Given the lack of demonstrable change in overall reactor biomass based on protein analysis during the Se reduction experiments (Appendix D3), and the relatively low abundance of SeRB noted in the microbial community study (Chapter 4) , it seems 178 Figure 22. DGGE gel comparing DNA extracted from 10\u00b0C reactors , Dry Valley. LADDER Chert Chert of the native consortium (especially, the Fe and Mn- reducing organisms) and likely not solely coupled to Se reduction. The well -known process of hydrocarbon degradation linked to Fe and Mn reduction under anaerobic conditions [ 62- 64] very likely provides the simpler C compounds that support Se reduction in these reactors, in the absence of added C. Whether the hydrocarbon degradation is directly linked to Se reduction (as opposed to NO 3-, Mn, or Fe reduction) cannot be determined from available data. Changes in B iomass in Reactors Efforts to quantify changes in protein in the Smoky Canyon batch reactors during Se reduction were unsuccessful, potentially due to interference of humic compounds in the organic- rich solutions with the colorimetric assa y used in the Coomassie method. Results of these analyses are presented in Appendix D3. Use of the Pierce cleanup kit resulted in low protein yield and did not improve the ability to resolve systematic changes in protein within these native sediment reactors. Alternatively, these findings may simply reflect limited relative growth of SeRB organisms within the reactors during the Se reduction process. Samples were spiked with groundwater containing 10 4 and 106 SeRB per gram of rock (Chapter 4) from Smoky Can yon and Dry Valley mines respectively, and it is likely that there was little subsequent increase in population density to measure as the SeO 42- reduction process in the reactor proceeded. This is supported by the microbial community analysis, which indica ted that the number of SeRB in unsaturated chert and shale sediments is lower than in groundwater, and that the microbial community is dominated by hydrocarbon- oxidizing,and Fe 3+, Mn4+, and NO 3- reducing 180 bacteria, rather than SeRB (see Chapter 4). Regardless, the inability to measure changes in protein limits the ability to report a Se reduction rate relative to biomass. Se Mineralization in Batch Reactors Characterizing the mineral products that resulted from the Se reduction process is important in understanding the operational potential of in situ stabilization of Se in backfilled panels and/or constructed reactive barriers. Minerals produced through microbial activity may have different potential for re -oxidation or desorption of reduced Se, thereby aff ecting the capacity for Se attenuation. Results of synchrotron XANES and XRD analyses are presented in Appendix F and summarized below. Results of S- XRD were somewhat limited due to the complexity of the background sample mineralogy. Quartz and microcline feldspar were confirmed with matches to all peaks in the Jade software standard library, while hematite was probably present in samples of both chert and shale, based on matches to multiple peaks in the region of interest within its diffraction spectra. Zaherite (Al 12(SO 4)5(OH) 2620H20) was also identified in a pre-reduction sample of chert. In post-reduction samples of chert, sodium SeO 32- was confirmed and ferroselite (an FeSe 2 mineral) and copper selenide were probably present, with matches to some peaks in known reference spectra. Samples of shale contained probable Se 0 (based on matches to 3 or more peaks), with likely organo- Se compounds methyline selenafulvene and toluene selenoic acid, as well as FeSe 2. No SeO 32- bearing minerals were identified in the shale. Efforts to visualize microbes in association with Se minerals following reduction were unsuccessful using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), due 181 to the abundance of fine graine d silts in the samples and the detection limit of approximately 0.1 to 1.0 wt% Se for this method relative to low mass of Se potentially precipitated on the mineral surfaces as a result of these experiments. For these reasons, Se was analyzed using the more sensitive XANES and S -XRD methods at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Light Source. Following the previous analyses of Se using XANES [65-67], several standard Se compounds were included in these analyses as listed in Table S5 -6. The x -ray absorption energy edge position was measured for several Dry Valley and Smoky Canyon 10\u00b0C reactor samples collected at different time steps. The \"shale only\" and \"chert only\" samples represent the natural background mineralogy in rock substrate prior to formation of Se minerals in the batch reactor. One additional \"live\" end sample was studied, which reflected the composition of the reactor at the time it was decommissioned, several months after the Se reduction process had ended in a sample that was incubated at room temperature. This measurement was made to identify stable mineral products of the reduction process. Reduction products were also compared with the Se solid mineral phases present in abiotic control reactors at the end of the experiment. Comparison of the energy edge (eV) measured for standards with those measured in the background, live reactor, and control samples are summarized in Table S5-6. The geometry of the uniquely shaped spectra shown in Figures 23a (Dry Valley) and Figure 23b (Smoky Canyon) suggests that different end products result from reduction in chert and shale lithotypes. It is difficult to resolve Se 0, SeC, and selenide from one another 182 Figure 23. XANES analyses of waste rock from rate reactors for (A) Dry Valley and (B) Smoky Canyon. Colored lines indicate locations of SeO 42-, SeO 32-, and Se0 energy peaks. A, Dry Valley B, Smoky Canyon A, Dry Valley B, Smoky Canyon 183 based on energy edge alone, so interpretation must also consider the shape of the spectra obtained for each standard. The energy edge and spectral data in Table S5-6 and Figure 23a show that little if any SeO 42- was present on the solids in any of the samples, regardless of lithology or mine site studied, and in spite of the elevated concentration known to be present in solution in the reactors at the start of the experiment. This is consistent with the low capacity for SeO 42- sorption that is reported to exist under neutral to alkaline conditions, which are similar to those that exist in these reactors [18, 20, 28, 68]. Figures 2 2 a and b show t he chert samples from the Dry Valley and Smoky Canyon mines exhibit ed an overall shift from SeO 32- to Se0. In Figure 22 a, the background and pre-reduction reactor solid phase had a Se edge that matched SeO 32-, but as reduction proceeded , the SeO 32- peak that is strongly in evidence at 12662 eV at t=128 hours is diminished and a peak aligning with Se0 at 12660 eV appeared on the shoulder of the spectra at t = 272 hours. Selenite (with minor amounts of reduced Se) appears to be the dominant form of Se present in the Smoky Canyon chert in background sediments and pre-reduction samples (t=0). In Figure 22b, the intensity of peaks at 12660 and 12662 eV both increased in mid-reduction phase (t=228), with the SeO 32- peak at 12662 eV increasing in intensity relative to the reduced phase represented by the \"shoulder\" peak at 12660 eV . The SeO 32- peak at 12662 eV declined in intensity relative to the more reduced form in the latest reduction time step (t=272), suggesting a shift toward more reduced Se, although both were present at the end of the reduction process. The rather narrow sh ape of the more reduced Se peak at 12660 eV suggests the presence of Se 0, 184 rather than the more reduced forms selenide or SeC, which have energy edge values similar to one another, but a broader shaped spectrum. Thus, in the chert reactors of both sites, Se added as SeO 42- was reduced to SeO 32-, which likely sorbed onto mineral surfaces, and then subsequently transformed to the more reduced, insoluble Se0. From the geometry of the peaks observed in Figure 2 2, it appears that more Se was transformed to the elemental form in the Smoky Canyon Mine treatments than in the Dry Valley Mine treatments . The Se characteristics of the shale samples show a somewhat different pattern than those for chert . In background and pre-reduction samples from both mine sites, peaks corresponding to both SeO 32- at 12662 eV and SeM at 12660 eV are evident . In the Dry Valley Mine reactor (Figure 23a), both peaks grew in intensity in relative proportion to one another, with the \"shoulder\" peak at 12660 eV shifting towards alignment with the energy edge of the reduced Se0 mineral at mid reduction phase (t=128). At the end of reduction, the peak appears to shift slightly towards a broader shape that is more characteristic of FeSe 2, although subtle differences make it difficult to be conclusive. A similar pattern was observed for the shale sample from the Smoky Canyon Mine reactor (Figure 22b). These results suggest that SeO 42- added to the shale reactors was reduced to SeO 32- and SeM , followed by transformation of some of each reaction product to a more reduced FeSe 2 compound. Two hypotheses to consider as explanations for the observed differences in alternative biogeochemical pathways include (1) shifts in Se methylation enzyme regul ation as a toxicity response to the higher salinity of the shale geochemistry, e.g. elevated SO 42- or metal content and ( 2) the reaction of reduced SeO 32- with primary 185 FeS 2 present in the shale, thus forming Se0 and releasing Fe2+ into solution [ 53]. The latter mechanism fits well with the observed increase in dissolved Fe at neutral pH that was observed in association with Se reduction in these experiments. These results agree with the aqueous speciation data reported in Table 11 for chert and shale, which suggest that SeO 32- is produced initially and then removed from solution, either through sorption to the solid phase or through further reduction to insoluble Se0 and selenide minerals . Within the pH range observed for the Dry Valley chert ( 7.3-7.5 ) and shale ( 6.6- 6.8) reactors the majority of Se(IV) should be present as HSeO 3-. In this range, Se(IV) should sorb strongly to Fe oxyhydroxide minerals [ 18]. It is important to note, however, that average pH observed in the field at Dry Valley was somewhat higher than this value (7.8, Table S5-4, see also Table A1-1 through 3 ), closer to the HSeO 32-/SeO 32- boundary. The extent of pH-dependent sorption predicted based on results from the reactor could therefore vary somewhat in the field setting . Sorption does not explain the relatively faster reduction of Se by the chert sediment s, as the higher pH of the chert should be somewhat less likely than shale to promote sorption of negatively charged oxyanions. Recent work by Martin and others [ 69] using x- ray fine structure ( XAFS ) described distinct SeO 32- and SeO organo- Se reduction profiles in lentic sediments . In these environments, low O2 concentrations drive similar Fe -N-Mn cycling and Se - redox transformations, with insoluble Se0 partition ing to the solid phase, and volatile organo- Se and SeO 32- being released to the aqueous phase. These results are also consistent with those reported by Chen et al. (2009), who described SeO 32- reduc tion to 186 Se0 under concurrent Fe3+-reducing conditions, releasing sorbed SeO 32- into solution where it was available for subsequent microbial reduction to Se0 [70]. It is also possible that desorbed SeO be abiotically reduced by biogenically -produced Fe2+ [71-73]. The close association of isolate d Fe-reducing organisms such as Rhodoferax with heterotrophs such as Cellulomonas and Arthobacter shown to be capable of Se reduction in multiple enrichment cultures from Smoky Canyon and Dry Valley , as well as the elevated Fe2+-concentrations associated with SeO 42- reduction in experiments conducted with native consortia from both mine sites (Figures 1 9, 20), suggest s the existence of a potentially important mechanistic link between Fe and Se reduction . In the absence of green -rust, the only known abiotic catalyst of SeO 42- reduction [ 74, 75], the observed association of Fe and Se in these reactors is inferred to be an Fe2+-SeO 32- interaction . Belzile et al. described a very similar, multi- scale process of biological and chemical Se attenuation [76]. They characterized the remobilization of SeO 32- initially sorbed onto Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides, which we re dissolved through biotic reduction under progressively reducing conditions developed during diagenesis. Iron and Mn- reducing organisms promot ed mineralization of organic matter in the sediments and supported the formation of Se0, seleniferous pyrite, and selenides [ 76]. These results have important implications for the function of a SeO 42--reducing reactive barrier or backfill environment within waste rock deposits, in that sorbed SeO 32-complex es have potential to be desorbed and/or remobilized from reduced iron oxide substrates. The cycling of Fe (and probably Mn) is likely to influence downstream geochemical pathway s, wherein the reduced Fe and Mn produced in these suboxic 187 environments may also play a direct role in subsequent abiotic SeO 32- reduction . The long term stability of sorbed SeO 32- complexes is less certain than that of re duced and insoluble Se0 and Se2- minerals [17, 77]. Although Se reduction may proceed more rapidly in chert due to SeO 32- sorption, at least initially, th e more reduced selenide product observed in the shale potentially offer s greater long -term stability . Changes in Microbial Community During Se R eduction DNA extracted from Dry Valley samples collected from chert and shale batch reactors for key reduction time steps was compared using DGGE in Figure 23. Samples of sediment from the most field relevant 10\u00b0C chert and shale reactors were compared with a ladder comprised of organisms isolated from groundwater and sediment MPNs . Bands were cut where possible to allow sequencing of the DNA fragments, thus identifying phylotypes with high degree of similarity to community analysis at the genus level; these results are compared with isolates in the ladder, which were identified at both the genus and in a few cases, the species level. Changes in band intensity representing changes in operational taxonomic unit (OTU) abundance and, by inference community composition, we re evident in the rate reactors for chert and shale during the reduction process. Band alignment in the chert suggests an initial community dominated by multiple organisms with a high degree of similarity to members of the genera Dechloromonas , Brevundimonas , Sphingomonas , and with other unidentified organisms represented by fainter bands. The community, as suggested by the identified OTUs, appears to transition to a more limited community comprised of genera including Dechloromonas, Ralstonia, Brevundimonas, Rhodoferax and members of the Actinobacteria class during Se and Fe reduction (t = 104 and 128 hours). Unfortunately, DNA from the earliest time of Se reduction in the chert (e.g., t = 48 hours) was destroyed and was not available for inclusion in this analysis. Community diversity appeared to return to levels comparable to time zero in the chert after the Se was reduced (t = 242 hours). A relatively more diverse community was observed in shale at t=0 in the reactor, which shifted to a much simpler community described by OTUs that aligned with ladder bands from the isolated dechloromanads, which were highly similar to the species isolate d at the mid -reduction phase. F aint DNA bands began to appear at t=128 hours that align ed with the band of an isolated Rhodoferax . Bands in the shale aligning with a Brevundimonas isolate and, to a lesser degree, a Sphingomonas isolate, increased in intensity during Se and Fe reduction (t = 104 and 128 hours ), while a band aligning with a Rahnella isolate intensified at t=242 hours. Community div ersity did not appear to return to initial conditions as clearly in the shale at the end of reduction, but the overall faint pattern s at t=128 and 242 hours suggest that this may simply reflect lower concentrations of DNA in the gel. Bands that appeared in the upper portion of the gel at t=104 and 128 hours in the chert, and t=128 and 242 hours in the shale, were strongly similar to results obtained in preliminary gels with the genus Ralstonia. 189 The changes in microbial community indicated by the DGGE ana lysis agree with the aqueous speciation data reported in Table 11 for chert and shale, which show that SeO 32- is only detected rarely and early in the reduction process. It may be that it is produced initially and then removed from solution, either through sorption to the solid phase or further reduction to insoluble Se 0 and Se2- minerals . Overall, Figure 2 3 provides an indication of microbial community changes as reduction proceeded in the chert and shale reactors for the Dry Valley Mine, under the field r elevant temperature of 10\u00b0C. These findings suggest the involvement of microbes known to break down hydro carbon s and reduce SeO 42-, SeO 32-, Fe3+, Mn4+, and NO 3-. Differences in the microbial community appear to exist between the two lithologies, which may in part explain the observed differences in rate, speciation, and reaction pathway. A dditional research would be needed to investigate the specifics of these influences . Overall, the phylotypes identified in the DGGE analyses confirm the presence of the otherwise isolated SeO 42- reducing Dechloromonas sp. A34 (Childers, unpublished data, this study ) and a Rhodoferax sp . Sequences with a high degree of similarity to the heterotrophic genera Brevundimonas and Sphingomonas, both of which have members known to degrade aromatic hydrocarbons [78], were identified in chert and shale. Phylotypes strongly similar to the genus Rahnella, members of which a reported SeO 42--reducer [79], and Actinobacter ia only appeared in the shale. A phylotype highly similar to a Pseudomonas , which was present in the initial community in both chert and shale, was evident again following Se reduction in the chert, but not in the shale. The DNA band associated with 190 the genus Ralstonia [ 80, 81], members of which have been shown to have the ability to reduce Se, was stronger during the mid- reduction phase for both lithotypes . Conclusions Selenate reduction by indigenous microbes using native C in groundwater- saturated phosphate mine overburden was studied under conditions representative of subsurface backfills in S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area, to determine its potential effectiveness for in situ source control. Kinetic experiments were conducted under microaerophilic conditions to evaluate how SeO 42- reduction proceeds in mineralogically -distinct chert and shale waste lithologies . Analyses of Se, Fe, Mn, N, S, P and C in aqueous and solid phases, together with measurements of pH and O 2. Results indicate that biotic SeO 42 reduction beg an following biogeochemical reduction of O 2 and some (but possibly not all) NO 3- , and wa s significan tly associated with concurrent Fe and Mn reduction. Remaining soluble NO 3- was reduced as SeO 42- reduction began, but there was an apparent increase in total dissolved N as reduction proceeded . Observed reduction in DOC suggests that carbon obtained through degradation of hydrocarbons present in the rock support ed the observed reduction of Se as well as Fe and Mn , with a fraction of the DOC consumed during the reduction process. It is possible that other electron donors also supported the Se reduction. Sulfate was not reduced in either rock type, nor was phosphate measured in solution. The pH wa s relatively constant within each reactor during the reduction process ; pH was lower in shale treatments than in chert at Dry Valley , however. 191 Selenium wa s reduced in a step -wise process, from SeO 42- to SeO 32- in both chert and shale, at rates influenced by temperature and possibly different SeO 32- reduction pathways and microbial communities that yield ed different mineral products. Reduction occurred more quickly in chert (4.3 to 10.2 \u00b5g Se/kg rock/hr), which had lower SO 42- concentrations ( approximately 300 mg/L) and pH values between 7.2 and 7.8, using natural hydrocarbon with relatively fewer aromatic compounds, and produced SeO 32- and Se0. Reduction oc curred more slowly in shale (3.0 to 6.3 \u00b5g Se/kg rock/hour ) at concentrations of SO 42- between 900 and 1300 mg/L and pH values between 6.7 and 6.9, using a mixture of natural aromatic and alkane hydrocarbon, and producing SeO 32-, methylated Se, and Se-2 minerals as reduction products. In spite of differences in rate and end-products, reduction in both lithologies within 100 hours reduced the majority of SeO 42- to insoluble forms when saturated, low O2 (less than 0.3 mg/L) conditions we re developed. Changes in the bacterial community were evident between treatments at different temperatures , and to a lesser degree , rock type. Changes in DNA banding patterns indicate that higher numbers of a Rhodoferax- like bacteri um were present early in the SeO 42- reduction process. The banding pattern showed increases in phylotypes representative of the genera Dechloromonas (known SeO 42- reducer s) in shale and Ralstonia (also known SeO 32- reducer s) in both lithologies as reduction proceeded . This analysis of community response to SeO 42- exposure under microaerophilic conditions suggests hydrocarbon degradation may be coupled with denitrification and Fe-reduction, in association with Se reduction. The biogeochemical factors driving mineralization to 192 different endpoints should be confirmed with further analysis, perhaps using pyrosequencing and fine scale XAFS tools to better resolve the microbial community and the biomineralization pathways . Results of these experiments show that facultative members of this microbial community are likely to couple oxidation of native carbon to O 2 reduction, quickly driving the saturated microcosms to microaerophilic and ultimately, conditions that support NO 3-, Fe, Mn, and Se reduction. Capacity for in situ Se reduction by indigenous organisms using electron donors present in the rock was documented using samples from two mine sites, located 15 miles apart, which produce phosphate from the same geological formation. Results of this study explain observed differences in Se concentrations between wells completed in backfill at the two mine sites , which could not previous ly be explained based solely on solid phase equilibria (TetraTech, 2007). Although lithology affected the reduction rate and mineral end product, Se reduction within either rock type wa s relatively rapid under low O 2 conditions (on the order of weeks) when compared with the probable residence time of water within a backfilled mine facility , which typically ranges from months to years. Although Se reduction rates and mechanisms differ subtly between the two mine sites in these experiments, likely reflecting different microbial communities and/or abundance resulting from the different in situ O 2 conditions, the native microbes from both locations at Dry Valley ( GW7D) and Smoky Canyon ( GW11 ) were able to provide effective Se-reducing capacity when grown on either chert or shale under saturated, microaerophilic conditions. It is likely, however, that shale will offer better moisture retention and capacity to consume O2 within a 193 backfilled panel or a constructed reactive barrier zone, due to finer grain size and higher organic C content, as well as promote the formation of more reduced mineral products which have lower potential for re -oxidation and remobilization. These results suggest that successful designs relying o n microbial reduction as source control within the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area overburden deposits are possible. Successful designs will depend most significantly on the management of rock and water to develop and maintain suitably microaerophilic and moist conditions.

Multiple samples of shale and chert were collected from sonic drill core and near surface excavations to represent the range of mineralogy, texture, and geochemistry of backfilled overburden deposits. Samples were air -dried, flailed, and graded through sieve and hydrometer analysis. Sub 1/4 inch rock was composited, split, and digested with aqua regia followed by analysis o f multiple elements by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP -MS). Methylene chloride extractable C species identified for two composited samp les of chert and shale from the Smoky Canyon Mine using EPA method 3350, followed by Gas Chromotography M ass Spectroscopy (GC -MS) following EPA method 8270C. Groundwater samples were collected from a well completed in saturated backfill at the base of backfilled panel B at the Dry Valley Mine (GW7D2a) and from a well completed in partially (and intermittently) saturated backfill in panel A at the Smoky Canyon Mine (GW11). Water was bailed manually using a disposable plastic bailer weighted to facilitate se diment recovery during sampling, as a means of collecting both planktonic and attached microbes. Samples were transferred immediately into sterile glass or polypropylene bottles and stored at 10\u00b0C in the dark without headspace. Groundwater pH, dissolved O 2 content (Hach model AQ4, Loveland, Colo) and temperature were measured at the time of sampling . Groundwater samples were collected 195 as close as possible to the start of each series of reactor experiments to limit the effects of storage on chemistry and microbial communities. Less frequently, samples from each well were submitted for a comprehensive analysis of major and trace element chemistry; chemistries reported in 2007 are provided in Table S5-1. These samples were collected using low flow pumping techniques and preserved without headspace for analysis of dissolved metals using 0.45 \u00b5 m filtration and nitric acid; total metals using nitric acid; nutrients using hydrochloric acid; and major ions/alkalinity (no filtration or reagent addition). Relative con stant chemistry, with minor seasonal variation, has been observed in each of the wells over time . Dissolved organic carbon (DOC, by standard method 5310) and volatile aqueous C species (by Head Space- Micro Extraction -Gas Chromatography -Mass Spectrometry, HS-SPME -GC-MS) were also measured collected from GW7D2A. Total Element Analysis (ICP -MS) Following A qua Regia Digestion Samples of chert, shale, an d a run-of- mine mixture containing 55% shale, 35% chert, and 10% mudstone were analyzed for 51 elements by ICP-MS following aqua regia extraction at ALS Chemex laboratories (MEMS41). Organic Carbon Speciation in R ock Solvent extractable organic carbon was extracted using methylene chloride by EPA method 3550B and analyzed by EPA Method 8270C at Energy Laboratories in Billings, MT . Chromatographic spectra from unknowns were identified tentatively by comparison with the NIST standard reference database by En ergy Laboratories . 196 Table S5-1.

CHERT Quartz Hematite Clay Aluminum sulfate Carbonate SHALE Quartz Microcline Hematite Fluoroapatite Zinc Sulfide Water -extractable Se, Fe, Mn, NO 3- and DOC Leachable Se, Fe, Mn, and NO 3- were measured from bottle -roll extracted solutions by ICP and Ion chromatography. Rock was leached in a 3:1 ratio of distilled water to solid in an aerated 24 hour bottle roll at room temperature. Samples were allowed to stan d for 1 hour, followed by centrifugation to remove solids and filtered to 0.20 \u00b5M prior to analysis. Total Se, Fe, and Mn were measured by ICP. DOC and t otal N were measured as described above in the methods section. Rock and Groundwater G eochemistry Characterization Representative samples of rock and groundwater used to construct batch reactors were characterized for total and leachable Se, Fe, Mn, SO 42-, NO 3-, and organic C content and speciation. A homogenized, representative composite of chert and shale was developed for each of the two mine sites using 24 mono-lithologic samples of overburden collected from backfill e xcavations at the Smoky Canyon Mine. An additional 34 samples were collected from an archived core of unconsolidated backfill from the Dry 197 Valley Mine drilled hole GW7D2. The bulk composites were prepared by compositing samples in equal proportions. In situ and analytical geochemical data reported previously for select samples from this hole [38] (see also Appendix A1) were used to guide sampling and composite development, in addition to data collected during this study. This provided a homogenized and characterized substrat e for experiments that represents the range of mineralogical, textural, and geochemical variation in pit backfill. XRD Analysis of R ock Samples of rock used to construct reac tors, and samples of rock following reduction of Se in batch reactors, were analyzed using the Scintag Inc. (USA) Advanced diffraction system XL . Randomly packed powder was analyzed from 5 to 75 degrees in 0.02 degree steps, at a power of 1.8 kW using an energ y of 45 kV and current set at 40 mA. Spectra were interpreted via comparison using a database of known XRD spectra provided by Scintag. The bench top XRD analysis provided a baseline analysis of major rock forming minerals, as shown in Table S5-1. Trace quantities of Se phases were identified, but no clear trends with reduction in samples from the batch reactors could be established.

These results indicate higher total Se, S, and TOC content in shale, compared to chert, with concentrations at the Dry Valley Mine twice those measured at the Smoky Canyon Mine. Comparable concentrations of Fe were observed between rock types (e.g., both chert and shale) at the Smoky Canyon Mine, with values again higher at the Dry Valley Mine. Total Mn concentration was higher in the chert sample than in shale at both mine sites, with slightly higher overall concentrations at the Smoky Canyon Mine . These results are relatively consistent with the variation known to exist within the Phosphoria Formation [82]. At the Smoky Canyon Mine, soluble NO 3- was relatively consistent in paste extracts between rock units, and significantly lower than the values reported for bottle roll extracts f rom the Dry Valley Mine. Both are reported. Dissolved organic C was lower in chert than in shale extracts, and comparable between mine sites . Total organic C (Table S5-3) was an order of magnitude higher in shale than in chert at both mine sites. Leachable organic C was also higher in shale at both mines. At the Smoky Canyon Mine, shale had a higher concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons and an overall higher ratio of aromatic to alkane and alkene compounds (Table S5-4) relativ e to chert. As the total organic C content in chert and shale was consistent between the two mine sites, and due to the cost of speciation analyses, extractable organic C was speciated only for samples from the Smoky Canyon Mine. Table S5-4 statistically describes t he long term chemistry of groundwater collected at the Dry Valley and Smoky Canyon mines, along with w ater quality data for samples of groundwater analyzed close to the time that samples were collected for use as 200 Table S5-3.

Dissolved organic C was speciated using HS -SPME -GC-MS for a sample of groundwater from the Dry Valley Mine monitoring well GW7 D2a.

Analyses were run by the RJ Lee Group, Center for Laboratory Sciences . The fiber was desorbed in the injector at 240\u00b0C with helium carrier gas at 1.0 mL/min ., followed by GC- MS analysis using EPA Method 8260 BFB tuning criteria. The oven temperature was ramped from 40 \u00b0C to 230\u00b0C at 5\u00b0C/min. Although it is possible to quantify volatile organic C compounds based on 202 equilibrium partitioning coefficients, this was not attempted, as the intended use of the data was qualitative identification of C compounds. HS -SPME -GCMS analyses were run to qualit atively identify volatile C species for eight samples including groundwater, lithology, specific groundwater extracts, and rate reactor water at the start and end of one set of replicate experiments. Compounds were tentatively identified using the NIST05 library [83] and results were edited to remove any compounds introduced with the standards. The tentative identifications provided by the laboratory were reviewed to ensure data quality by limiting identified compounds to well defined peaks with greater than 80% similarity to known compounds, within 0.2 minutes variance of known retention time. The relative amount of identified species was quantified by comparison with a 4 -bromofluorobenzene internal standard calibration curve delivered in methanol over the concentration range of 1.2 to 78 ng. Results are summarized in Appendix E. Volatile C compounds were measured by HS- SPME -GC-MS for samples of groundwater, as well as water from live and killed control reactors for both chert and shale at the end of reduction (Table S5-5). This method allow ed qualitative assessment of C speciation in the aqueous headspace only for volatile compounds, based on comparison of peak area with the mass of a known internal standard. T hese data can only indicate shifts in relative frequency of C species. Also, limited available sample restricted the number of these analyses, unfortunately , so that it was not possible to determine sample reproducibility. As preliminary results, however, the data presented in Table S5-5 suggest that the majority of C in the reactors came from the solid phase, rather than groundwater, which had relatively low initial concentrations of alkane and aromatic compounds. These 203 data also suggest that relatively larger numbers of shorter chain (fewer C) alkane compounds were initially present in the chert reactor than in the shale reactor and that concentration s of volatile hydrocarbons in the aqueous phase decreased as Se reduction proceeded . 204 Table S 5-5.

M icrobial source control of Se within deposits of phosphate mine waste in the S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resourc e Area is an important potential strategy for mine waste management and protection of water resources . Observations of apparent in situ Se reduction in backfill at multiple locations , and the results of controlled microbiological and kinetic geochemical experiment s presented here, support the conclusion that it is possible to intentionally develop conditions within saturated and organic- rich backfilled mine waste that will support Se reduction. Microbes living in backfilled mine overburden deposi ts can, under conditions that have been documented within full -scale mine backfill and dump facilities, reduce soluble and toxic SeO 42- and SeO 32- to insoluble and less toxic Se0 and Se2- minerals. More than ten years of in situ monitoring data from Dry Valley GW7D describing suboxic conditions in partially saturated to saturated backfill demonstrate, at the broadest scale, that this is true. In this study, the biogeochemical conditions observed at this site have been linked with microbial communities and geochemical processes active at the pore scale, and contrasted with those in other S.E. Idaho Phosphate Resource Area waste deposits at Smoky Canyon and Enoch Valley, as a foundation for the design of facilities that integrate biogeochemistry across these scales. The following discussion summarizes 218 the findings of this study, and outlines the questions it raises regarding the implementation of in situ microbial source control of Se within phosphate overburden deposits. This study applies a variety of existing knowledge regarding the biogeochemistry of Se to questions of mine waste management. For example, t he existence of Se-reducing bacteria (SeRB) , and the impact they have on the kinetics of Se cycling in the environment, is well documented [ 3]. A number of microbes capable of reducing Se in the environment are known and many commercial water treatment processes (active or passive) rely on microbi al Se reduction with addition of carbon (C) and nutrients [ 4]. Similarly, the potential for reactive barriers to intercept contaminants in groundwater is also well known [ 5] and Se remediation using this approach has been the focus of other, ongoing investigations [ 6]. However, t he intentional design of m ine facilities (backfills and overburden dumps among others ) to act as operational sinks by facilitating biological reduction of Se remains relatively unexp lored. This study begins at the hydrogeochemical field scale (Chapter 2 and Figure 3) and works ba ck to a micro scale understanding of microbial geochemistry (Figure 4) based on the identity, number, and reduction capabilities of native microbes (including SeRB) under field relevant lithotype, chem istry, and moisture conditions. This study has identified a variety of native SeRB which function within a community of hydrocarbon -oxidizing and NO 3-, Fe3+, and Mn4+-reducing, aerobic and facultative anaerobic microbes. The SeRB include several SeO 42-respiring Dechloromonads , as well as other SeRB including Anaeromyxobacter spp. and Stenotrophomonas spp., also known to reduce SeO 42- for detoxification or other non-219 respiratory reasons. Only Dechloromonas was shown to grow on SeO 42- and reduc e it to Se0 under anaerobic conditions (Childers, unpublished data this study ). Also in this study, other SeRB isolates were shown to reduce SeO 32-, but not SeO 42-, including members of and Sphingomonas genera. Other bacteria genera that were not isolated, but which were identified in molecular work, including Anaeromyxobacter and Ralstonia, are also known SeO 32--reducers. Results presented here suggest that Dechloromona s spp. can reduces SeO 42- in a stepwise fashion to SeO 32- and then Se0, using complex native hydrocarbon and dominates the SeRB community in groundwater samples from both Dry Valley and Smoky Canyon. Based on the absence of dechloromonads in clone libraries and most dilute positive MPN cultures , however, this genus appear s to be present in relatively low numbers in unsaturated sediments , where the SeRB were shown to , Stenotrophomonas , and other heterotrophs. Interestingly, phylotypes highly similar to the Fe-reducing genus Rhodoferax occur frequently in the clone libraries and DGGE analyses of unsaturated sediment enrichments, in association with the heterotrophic SeRB (Chapter 4), but rarely in the groundwater samples. This raises interesting questions which should be further investigated regarding the role that Rhodoferax spp. may play in providing Fe 2+- to serve as an electron shuttle in support of biotic Se reduction (or perhaps abiotic SeO 32- reduction) in unsaturated environments. A number of opportunities remain to learn more about this complex microbial ecology and its influence on the mineralization endpoints of reduction in this system. A more comprehensive analysis of the diversity and abundance of microorganisms using state-of -the- art methods is essential t o obtain a more statistically robust analysis . This 220 work was conducted at a time when high throughput genomic methods (such as 454 pyrosequencing) were far more expensive than they are today, and these methods were therefore unavailable to this project. Th e limitations of the DGGE method, relative ly small clone libraries, and inconsistencies in iden tified SeRB between various dat a subsets (e.g., MPN cultures, isolate populations, and clone libraries), suggest that a more comprehensive approach using methods such as pyrosequencing of rock and groundwater samples would be highly informative . It would also be interesting to conduct more focused rate experiments using a defined mixed culture consisting of key members of the identified SeRB and a Rhodoferax isolate , with one select member of the hydrocarbon- degrading microbial community, under controlled conditions of NO 3- addition and more carefully tracked changes in NO 3-, NO 2-, Mn4+, Mn3+, Mn2+, Fe3+, and Fe2+ concentrations. Isolates to be included could be chosen from the community results defined with DGGE. Experiments should be conducted in the presence of known hydrocarbon electron donors and select Fe and Mn mineral substrates, to reduce the complexity of the experimental system. Outstanding questions that could be addressed in these experiment s include: 1. Is the observed increase in dissolved Fe 2+ reproducible, and is it associated with an increase in the Rhodoferax (or another Fe /Mn-reducing microbial) population? D oes it reflect an abiotic reaction of selenite with primary FeS 2 mineralization? 2. Can the isolated members of the Rhodoferax genus , which did not reduce SeO 42- to Se0 in culture , be shown to specifically facilitate the ability of other organisms to reduce SeO 42- to SeO 32-, and thus contribute to Se 221 reduction through community level interactions? Does this occur in the presence of specific Fe- oxide substrates? 3. Why d oes the aqueous total N concentration increase during the middle of the Se reduction process, as suggested by the results shown in Figures 19 and 20? How does this relate to the observed increase in dissolved Fe concentration? Is this associated with increased numbers of N 2-fixing organisms i n the microbial community? 4. Are the microbial communit y changes indicated in Figure 23 reproducible? Or, is there a change in the community within a consistent set of functional microbial niches that correspond with other biogeochemical variables, such as m oisture or lithologically -controlled geochemistry? How might the observed biogeochemistry inform the management of such a microbial community in a pilot or field scale facility? The most favorable conditions for Se reduction appear to be in saturated or m oist conditions (close to field capacity) where sufficient soluble Se and organic C is available to support higher numbers of SeRB. The SeRB were present in gre atest numbers (5 x 10 6 SeRB per gram of rock) in moist, fine -grained crushed shale that were Se and C rich . The number of SeRB was negligible in chert and mudstone lithotypes (3x102 SeRB per gram of rock ), and no Se reduction was observed in aerobic MPN experiments for any lithotypes . 222 The greatest numbers of SeRB in sediment collected from turbid groundwater were from the Dry Valley backfill well GW7D2a (4.6 x106 SeRB per gram of rock), which had less than 0.2 mg/L initial dissolved O 2. There were approximately 300 times more SeRB at in saturated sediments collected from groundwater Dry Valley than from Smoky Canyon (1.6 x 104 SeRB per gram of rock ), which had elevated concentrations of dissolved O 2 (5 mg/L) . Many of the identified SeRB bacteria are facultative and therefore can use O2 and/or NO 3- until they are depleted , and SeO 42- reduction can occur . Results of this study indicate that members of the native m icrobial consortia make use of variable O2 and moisture conditions within the mined overburden for both aerobic and anaerobic degradation of complex shale hydrocarbons. This is reflected by the diversity of identified organisms, which reduce SeO 42- using the available, naturally - occurring hydrocarbon compounds under Fe3+, Mn4+ , and NO 3- reducing conditions. Bacteria capable of aerobic hydrocarbon degradation ( e.g., Polaromonas) and anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation coupled to NO Fe3+, (e.g., Rhodoferax , Pelosinus, Geothrix, and Dechloromonas ) have been identified. It is likely that degradation of complex shale hydrocarbons by aerobic members of the community decreases available O2, thus creating conditions favorable for SeO 42- reduction by facultative anaerobes like Dechloromonas and Stenotrophomonas , as well as other heterotrophic SeRB. Experiments to determine rates of O 2, NO 3-, Fe3+, Mn4+ and SO 42- reduction were conducted under saturated, microaerophilic conditions. The results presented here show ed that following depletion of O 2 (via biotic and abiotic mechanisms), biological NO 3-, Fe3+, and Mn4+ reduction occurred together with Se reduction, but SO 42- reduction 223 was not observed. Natural C of mixed complexity (including alkanes, cyclic, and aromatic compounds) from the solid phase was solubilized and a fraction (less than 40% of soluble C ) was consumed. Reduction of Se occurred more slowly in shale than chert, at Dry Valley, at both temperat ures, and was slower at field -relevant 10 \u00b0C than at room temperature; no difference in rate (Table 10) was observed between lithology at Smoky Canyon experiments . In the experiments conducted for both sites, reduction occurs within 100 hours once low O 2 conditions were developed in both lithotypes. As the residence time of groundwater mov ement in field scale facilities is likely to be on the order of months or years, rather than days, these data suggest that it is likely possible to design facilities to retain water long enough to deplete residual O 2 and reduce available SeO 42- and SeO 32-. The extent to which this is true will depend upon balancing the flux of oxidants into the system against its capacity for reduction, which is in turn dependent on the rate of air (O 2) flow, water flow, and available C, and will need to be considered on a site specific basis. The O2 demand and replenishment rate can potentially be altered, where necessary, through amendment (e.g., addition of clays) or placement of rock in short, compacted lifts to increase water retention and reduce water flux rates . Other strategies targeting the creation of suboxic zones include the use of textural discontinuities and capilla rity [7], construction of efficient store and release covers [8], and addition of C to consume oxygen and thereby promote the develop ment of desired O 2 gradients. Potential health and safety risks associated with CO 2 accumulation and seasonal displacement from constructed facilities could require monitoring and management with institutional controls [9, 10]. This study has not evaluated the potential for re -oxidation of reduced Se minerals, but this risk should be addressed in tandem with 224 in situ demonstration studies, to consider a realistic flux of o xidants (e.g., O 2 and NO 3-) as well as potential for re -oxidation by soluble Fe3+ and Mn4+. The aqueous speciation of Se and reduced secondary Se mineralization described in the reactor experiments support chert- and shale- specific biogeochemical pathways at Dry Valley . In the chert reactor , SeO 42- was reduced to aqueous H SeO 3- /SeO 32- that was detected early in the reduction process . The fact that it was not detected subsequently suggests that it was rapidly removed from solution, either through adsorption to a solid phase mineral, probably clay or iron oxide, or through further reduction. T he HSeO 3- /SeO 32- was subsequently partially reduced to Se0, although the amount of H SeO 3- /SeO 32- reduction to Se0 varied between the two mine sites; the extent to which this was related to remobilization of HSeO 3- /SeO 32- during the concurrent reduction of Fe3+ is not clear. It may be that higher concentrations of Fe-oxide and clay minerals present in the chert (Table S5 -1) provided greater substrate for initial H SeO 3- /SeO 32- sorption, or that differences in pH (Appendix D1) between the two lithotypes subtly influence the extent of HSeO 3- /SeO 32- sorption, with consequence for subsequent H SeO 3- /SeO 32- availability for reduction . However, it is difficult to determine if sorption is the primary control defining the different pathways between the chert and shale, as in spite of the pH differences between the two lithotypes in reactors at Dry Valley , both have pH below 8 and should support H SeO 3- /SeO 32- sorption[ 11]. The sorption of the H SeO 3- /SeO 32- thus has the potential to alter the trajectory of the subsequent biogeochemical reduction pathway . It is also possible that the different concentrations of dissolved SO 42- between the chert and shale influenced the SeO 32- reduction pathway, as described by Hockin and Gadd [12]. Another possibility is that there is a difference in the availability of free Ca2+ 225 (as opposed to CaSO 40 aq) lithotypes, as a result of the different amount of available SO 42- between the two lithotypes in the reactors. This could influence the interim solubility of CaSeO 3xH 2O (Figure 5) and have a similar effect on the availability of SeO 32- for su bsequent biological reduction. This would be an interesting question to address from a modeling perspective. One way to address the significance of these factors on the reduction endpoint could be further examined in batch sorption experiments, with addition of Na SeO 3 under a controlled range of pH and SO 42- concentrations, using defined sorption substrates of known surface area including iron oxide mineral and/ or clay . Initial abiotic experiments conducted with speciation of Se, Fe, and Mn, followe d by mineralog ical analysis to identify surface complexation , could then be inoculated with select members of the Se-, Fe-, and Mn- reducing microbial community to evaluate potential differences in subsequence Se biomineralization. In the Dry Valley shale, SeO 42- was more slowly reduced , with some evidence of interim SeO 32- and selenomethionine ( SeM ) formation , followed by reduction to Se(-I I) and precipitation of FeSe 2 as shown by S- XRD and XAFS analyses . It is likely that the Se0 and Se (-II) reduction products will be less reversible and more stable than adsorbed SeO 32- . The potential for reoxidation of reduced Se minerals should not be discounted, however, and should be considered in design. Further study of the biogeochemical pathways that influence the differential production of Se0 and Se (-II) in chert and shale, respectively, may identify engineering strategies that can optimize the stabilization of Se for mo st effective long -term remediat ion. Preliminary aqueous data support the formation of SeM as an interim 226 reduction product, but these data require replication . The observed decline in dissolved Fe concentration agrees with field scale observations, and is explained by the identification of FeSe 2 in shale, but the comparable drop in Fe concentration in chert reactors that do not show evidence for Se(-I I) formation at the end of reduction suggests that this should be examined further. Questions remain about the extent of reduction under unsaturated , but oxygen- depleted conditions, in layered or mixed mine waste. At Enoch Valley, no groundwater saturated conditions were identified, yet suboxic conditions were identified. Much of the Intermountain West hosts mine waste deposits in high evaporation environments where the dominant waste condition is unsaturated. If suboxic conditions can be reliably and cost-effectively created under unsaturated conditions, through the use of capillary break, compaction, organic amendment, or other design para meters, there is significant potential benefit to be gained through NO 3-, SO 42- and metal reduction . Selenium reduction rate experiments were conducted using samples from two mine sites which produce phosphate from the same formation under different hydrologic conditions, located approximately 15 miles apart from one another. In spite of the relatively drier conditions in backfill at Smoky Canyon, zones were identified in the sediments of the panel A dump that hosted relative ly high er numbers of SeRB, comparable to those observed in Dry Valley groundwater where Se reduction has been observed in situ for over 10 years . Within unsaturated sediments , the num ber of SeRB varies within the shale, and differences in microbial community are observed both within the shales , and between the chert, shale, and mudstone lithotypes. In spite of these variations, the O 2, moisture, and geochemical conditions identified in this study that were 227 needed to support biological Se reduction lie within the range of in situ conditions identified in phosphate overburden at all three of the studied S.E. Idaho phosphate mine facilities . These results do not indicate a need to add Fe, NO 3-, or C to promote the in situ reduction of Se by native organisms, within a suboxic, steady state low flow environm ent in backfilled sediments comparable to that developed at Dry Valley. Collectively, the results of the microbial community, enumeration, and saturated rate reactor studies agree with in situ monitoring results, wherein low concentrations of soluble Se exists under dry conditions in unsaturated backfill, with low numbers of associated SeRB , as described at Enoch Valley [ 13]. Low dissolved concentrations of Se also exis t under moist (but, not necessarily saturated) and low O 2, but C-rich conditions, where the number of SeRB is greater , as has been observed at the Dry Valley B pit over time[14]. Higher concentrations of di ssolved Se are evident where Se rich shales are exposed to O 2 and water, promoting release of Se that is not locally re-reduced in situ , such as Smoky Canyon [ 15]. In facilities where saturation occurs in deep backfill, O2 is limited and local Se release following sulfide oxidation is low . In saturated environments, these results demonstrate that although sulfide is oxidized, native microbes can actively reduce soluble Se , Fe, and Mn. When saturation would not be possible, construction of facilities to limit O2 recharge usi ng placement of rock by individual dump trucks on lifts (as done at Enoch Valley, Dry Valley, and Luxor) or compaction/amendment of Se and C rich shales to promote higher moisture retention and Se reduction (as indicated by the high number of SeRB in the external panel A dump samples AS113 and AS71) may be of value. The extent to which the creation of suboxic conditions can be accomplished operationally, in a cost effective manner, is unclear, but these results suggest that it is 228 possible and potentially, highly effective. Reduction of Fe and Mn raises potential for changing concentrations of these elements downgradient, but potential for reoxidation of both ( as well as precipitation of oxide minerals with capacity for further sorption of other metals ) is high and also of potential environmental management value. Further, our results suggest that the native microbial community is capable of adapt ive metabolism, consuming O 2 while degrading hydrocarbons that further support SeRB and other reducing bacteria. When exposed to elevated O 2 concentrations, the SeRB did not efficiently reduce Se in groundwater monitored at GW11. However, fewer facultative bacteria capable of this process were detected at that location and were successfully stimulated in a closed, microaerophilic reactor, demonstrating that operational management of water and rock to create suboxia can make SeRB more efficient . The fact that reduction proceeds within chert when it is sa turated with groundwater under anaerobic conditions, in spite of the inherently low numbers of SeRB that exist in that lithotype, suggests that reduction would proceed within mixed lithology backfills. The ability of the system to tolerate repeated application of high Se water has not been studied in these experiments, but the availability of excess C and the long term monitoring record at Dry Valley suggest that in situ reduction of Se within overburden can be stable over a prolonged period of time as long as O 2 levels remain low and water flux rates (hence, O2 transport ) are minimized. Regardless, the goal of the in situ stabilization process described here is not to treat multiple volumes of water in rapid succession, but rather to stabilize Se within the mined overburden, thereby preventing the 229 need for such treatment. Treatment of multiple volumes of water would require consideration of the rate of C transformation to ensure sufficient C supply. Due to the experimental complexity in the construction and sampling of reactors that maintain partially saturated, anaerobic conditions at field relevant temperatures, and the scale- dependent character of the O2 consumption and replenishment processes, it seems more appropriate to further demonstrate the potent ial for in situ reduction of Se using paired laboratory and field experiments. This would allow laboratory experiments to reflect field conditions most realistically. Data characterizing scale- dependent parameters, such as those influencing the O 2 consumption and replenishment processes, can be measured in instrumented meso - or full -scale field facilities and used to address questions requiring greater experimental control in colu mn or flow reactor microcosms. Some aspects of the biogeochemical kin etics and microbial community analysis will require further laboratory study, however, but should be conducted using O 2, C, and other oxidant and reductant flux measurements determined from field investigations. Microbial Ecology in M ine Waste Facility Design The understanding of the environmental and financial risk posed by mine waste facilities , and their biogeochemistry, continues to evolve. Thirty years ago, mined lands had only begun to be recognized for their potential to affect water resources . Overburden dumps located merely to limit the cost of removing rock from extraction areas began to undergo active design , first to limit risk of hazard due to geotechnical failure, and then to manage water to prevent erosion and downstream sedimentation. More recently, the geochemistry and dynamics of water and gas flux within these facilities has been 230 characterized through geochemical testing and modeling , to predict the nature of potential impacts and evaluate alternative management options. Increasing ly sophisticated yet primarily abiotic conceptual models of elemental fate and transport drive the understanding of future aqueous chemi cal conditions and subsequent evaluation of environmental and financial risk. U ncertainty about the site -specific efficacy of available, affordable management options continually challenges mining operations because of the inherent difficulty in predicting chemical and hydrodynamic changes across geospatial and temporal dimensions of such magnitude. Ever m ore comprehensive, complex, and expensive sampling and modeling efforts reflect the industrial and regulatory commitment to overcome these challenges , but do not necessarily provide better answers . Meanwhile, f ailure to identify risk s associated with facility design (however unintentional) has put the social license of the industry to operate and grow in peril. Cast against growing demand for essential raw materials , and escalating environmental expectations , this situation puts the mining industry between a proverbial \"rock and a hard place\". Pressure to produce mineral resources , while maintaining the universal availability of clean water, presents mine operators, regulators, and stakeholders with increasingly difficult choices. A growing commitment to design and manage minin g operations \"sustainably\" appears to offer a meaningful path forward, based on the principle that \"ongoing creation of financial and social wealth should protect the future aesthetic and productive capacity of natural capital for fu ture generations\" [ 16, 17]. This concept recognizes the importance of a triple \"bottom- line\" decision framework that integrates social, environmental, and economic criteria . Decisions made in this context place a premium on options that can 231 effectively improve facility design for source control , thereby limiting down -gradient impact . Innovative designs that utilize the capacity of native microbial communities of mined materials, relying on management of available rock and water, to influence the biogeochemical processes that control rate s of metal release and sequestration , may well become an important component of future mine design. 232 References 1.

Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of British Columbia, Canada 2. Mount Polley Mine, Canada ABSTRACT Before tailings pond water can be discharged to the environment it must meet the very stringent local water quality requirements. In British Columbia, selenium must be below 1\u00b5g/L and sulfate, depending on the hardness of the receiving water, must be as low as 100mg/L. To meet this challenge, in anticipation of future mine expansion, Mount Polley Mine commissioned a pilot-scale passive treatment system to remove selenium and sulfate from their tailings pond water. The design was based on laboratory column tests with wood chips and hay that verified removal of selenium and sulfate to the required levels. This paper describes the design and construction of a sub-surface flow wetland and its evolution over several years into a passive remediation system. Regular monitoring and troubleshooting led to upgrades and modifications that improved performance. The subsurface layer of woodchips, hay and manure provides microorganisms with carbon sources. As part of a genomics project, material from this layer was shown to contain many different species of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Additional carbon inputs come from plants and filamentous algae that are beginning to populate the periphery and surface of the wetland. The genomics work also showed that planktonic algae were plentiful in the water column. This pilot- scale process shows that passive remediation can be used to improve the water quality of mine tailings pond water. Keywords: Biochemical reactors, metals, mining, bioremediation, microbial ecology, selenium, sulfate 2 INTRODUCTION The mining industry in British Columbia was valued at C$8.3billion in 2012 (The Mining Association of Canada, 2012) and is therefore a great contributor to employment and prosperity in the Province. Almost every mine has a tailings storage facility into which process effluents consisting of finely ground rock and water are placed. These are very large (squares of kilometers in size). Mount Polley had been investigating several ways of treating their tailings pond water so that they could discharge some of it so as to ease the demand for additional storage capacity. One of the approaches under consideration included a passive treatment process for metal and sulfate removal. Passive treatment means that natural biological and geochemical processes are harnessed in specially constructed sub-surface and/or surface flow wetlands. The purpose of each cell in the process is to provide the best environmental conditions to encourage the growth of biological organisms that promote metal immobilization and, in cases where needed, sulfate reduction. Since some engineering is usually required they are more accurately referred to as biochemical reactors (BCRs), and a variety of configurations have been used at mine sites to successfully remediate metal-contaminated water (Khoshnoodi et and Gusek, 2008; Gusek, 2008). The main constituents of interest that needed to be reduced in the Mount Polley tailings water in order to meet discharge requirements were sulfate, selenium, copper, molybdenum, phosphorus and nitrate. Sulfate can be reduced by sulfate-reducing bacteria, which are anaerobic organisms that grow in most natural terrestrial and oceanic sediments devoid of oxygen. Sulfate replaces oxygen as an electron acceptor in respiration of these organisms thereby producing the product sulfide. Metal removal occurs concomitantly as metal ions such as Cu2+ combine with S2- to make sparingly soluble metal sulfide precipitates (Jalali, 2000). Metalloids such as selenate and selenite can be reduced directly by bacteria to produce elemental forms that precipitate and are immobilized (Stolz et al., 2006;Baldwin and Hodaly, 2003). To achieve metal and sulfate removal the microbes involved are encouraged to grow by being provided with nutrients and anoxic conditions. In BCRs this is achieved through using organic materials obtained from forestry, agricultural and other wastes available nearby the mine site. Within close proximity of the Mount Polley Mine, wood chips, hay and cattle feed lot manure were obtained and shown to support growth of sulfate-reducing bacteria in proof-of-concept laboratory reactors that successfully removed sulfate and selenium to below the required concentrations. Based on these results, a pilot- scale BCR was constructed at the mine site in 2009. This paper describes the configuration of this BCR, the results of water quality and microbial community monitoring carried out over the ensuing years and subsequent modifications that were made to improve performance. METHODOLOGY Proof of concept laboratory experiments Plexiglas columns (I.D.: 11.43 cm, Length: 50.8 cm) hay, 20%dw and 30%dw cow manure were used as up-flow BCRs. These organic materials were pre- soaked in water overnight and adjusted to pH 8.0 before being added to the columns together with laboratory cultures of sulfate-reducing and cellulose-degrading bacteria as inocula as well as 3 crushed limestone for pH control. For the first few weeks, the columns were fed with a Postgate-B growth medium (Postgate, 1983) to allow a healthy sulfate-reducing bacteria population to build up. Thereafter, simulated tailings water containing 600mg/L sulfate and 15\u00b5g/L selenium, plus 52mg/L Iron (Fe) and sources of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) was fed to the BCRs. Iron was required as a source for excess sulfide precipitation. Accumulation of sulfide in the BCR would have inhibited the bacteria from growing, and therefore it had to be removed. The columns were set up so as to prevent any oxygen from getting in (since sulfate-reducers are obligate anaerobes). Over the period of operation, concentrations of sulfate and selenium were measured in the effluent using the turbidimetric barium sulfate American Water Work Association method 4500-SO 42-, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), respectively. Dissolved oxygen, pH and oxidation-reduction potential were monitored regularly so as to check that optimal conditions were being maintained in the BCRs. Construction of the field-based pilot-scale BCR A field-based pilot-scale BCR was constructed at the mine site in December 2009. After experimenting with smaller scale systems, a 100 gallon per minute sub-surface flow BCR with a water cover was constructed using the same organic material mixture composition as was used in the laboratory column experiments. The Figures below show the BCR during construction and immediately after commissioning. Water from the tailings storage facility toe drain flows into the bottom of the BCR through a series of parallel, perforated pipes, percolates upwards through the organic material and then flows out. A layer of rocks on top of the organics keeps them in place. A 3-4m deep water cover acts as an oxygen barrier. The treatment area is approximately 50m by 70m. An island was included in the centre of the pond for aesthetics. BCR monitoring Water quality data were collected regularly from the influent and effluent to determine the effectiveness of metal and sulfate removal. The inside of the BCR was sampled once a year by the University of British Columbia team. Since samples from within the organic matrix could not be accessed easily due to the rock layer covering them, water samples from just above the Figure 1 Construction of the field-based BCR showing the perforated feed pipes, organics (brown) and rock (right-hand side) layers. Figure 2 View of the completed BCR looking down from the top of the tailings storage facility. 4 sediment/water interface were taken. If the BCR was performing as expected then the water percolating out of the sediments into the water column would be anaerobic with evidence of sulfide as an indication of active sulfate-reducing bacteria in the sediments. The microbiology of the water just above the sediments was assessed to see if any sulfate-reducing bacteria were entrained by the water flowing out of the sediments, and to see what other microbes were colonizing the water column. Microbiological analysis was done by extracting DNA and subjecting it to sequencing of the small subunit ribosomal ribonucleic acid (SSU rRNA) gene, which is a barcode that is used to identify microbes. In 2012, the BCR was shut down and drained. At this time, solid samples were taken from within the organic matrix and frozen to preserve the microbial community for later analysis. The BCR was modified based on monitoring results, adding a berm to increase hydraulic retention time and replenishing with fresh organics. Further modifications in 2013 included installation of booms to reduce wind mixing so that anaerobic conditions could be better maintained. One year after reconstruction (August 2013), samples taken from the sediment layer were used for metagenomics, which is a new technique for measuring both the microbes present as well as their function. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Proof of concept laboratory experiments Even though the pH was adjusted to 8.0 before starting the BCRs, additional NaOH needed to be added to maintain the pH above 6.5. Organic acids leaching from the wood, or produced due to fermentation of organic matter, contributed to pH decrease. Since the desired bacteria require a circum-neutral pH in which to grow, pH adjustment was needed. The pH of the laboratory BCR feed was 8.0, similar to that of the Mount Polley effluent. After 114 days, the pH stabilized above 6.0 and it was only necessary to add NaOH sporadically thereafter. Throughout their operation, conditions remained optimal for sulfate-reducers with dissolved oxygen below 1mg/L except until day 374, when it suddenly increased to 4.7-5.7mg/L. The ORP was below -300mV and the pH was steady between 6.0 and 7.0. Sulfide levels inside the BCR were always below 100mg/L, which is much lower than those known to cause inhibition of sulfate-reduction (Utgikar et al., 2002). 5 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 0 100 200 300 400 500 BRTT1 BRTT2 BRTT3 Feed Time (Day) Figure 3 Plot of sulfate concentration versus time for the influent and effluents from all three of the laboratory BCRs. BRTT1, BRTT2 and BRTT3 are triplicate columns run under identical conditions. Sulfate concentration measurements were performed in triplicate with the average values plotted and the whiskers representing the standard deviation. Two of the BCRs were stopped after approximately 100 days after starting feed of the simulated tailings pond water so as to examine the nature of the microbial population associated with successful performance. The third BCR was run for a total of 430 days to see if and when it would fail. Performance was consistently successful for the entire period (Figure 3). For all BCRs the sulfate concentrations in the effluent were below 100mg/L, the level desired for discharge. The selenium concentrations in the effluent were below the detection limit (< 0.0001mg/L). The proof-of- concept experiment demonstrated that sulfate and selenium can be removed from the Mount Polley tailings water to the required levels using these organic materials in a BCR, provided that the pH is maintained near neutral, no oxygen is allowed to enter the bioreactor and that enough metal ions be present to keep sulfide levels low. Initial performance of the field-based pilot-scale BCR Initially, the field-based BCR successfully removed nitrite- plus nitrate-N and selenium to below detection levels (Table 1). Twenty three percent of the sulfate coming in was removed, but the final sulfate concentration was still well above the desired concentration of 100mg/L. Molybdenum concentrations decreased slightly and copper concentrations increased a little. During the 17 June 2010 field trip, 1-3mg/L sulfide was found at the sediment water interface of the BCR at all of the four locations sampled. This indicated that sulfate-reducing bacteria were active in the sediments as expected. Over the course of the following year, performance of the BCR was similar with the exception that sulfate-reduction was less. During the second University field trip in August 2011, no sulfide was detected at three of the sampling locations in the BCR. Some, 4.3mg/L, was measured at only one of the locations, indicating that only parts of the BCR were active for sulfate- reduction. Also, at that time, the sulfate concentrations at the sediment/water interface (464- 599mg/L) were not significantly different from those in the influent. 6 Table 1 Water quality parameters for the field-based pilot-scale BCR Sampling date Nitrite + Nitrate-N Sulfate Cu (dissolved) Mo (dissolved) Se (dissolved) In Out In Out In Out In Out In Out values Microbial community analysis from 2010 to 2012 Samples taken during the first two field trips in 2010 and 2011 from the sediment/water interface were analysed for microbial community composition, and in particular the types of sulfate-reducers present was determined (Figure 4). Sulfate-reducers were detected in the BCR in 2010 consistent with presence of sulfide, but they were absent from the sediment/water interface in 2011. Even though sulfate-reducers were not detected just above the sediment surface, they may still have been present inside the organic matrix. Nevertheless, the lack of detection of sulfate reducers coincided with declining performance of the treatment system (Table 1). In 2012, the BCR was drained and it became possible to take samples directly from the organic matrix. When these samples were analysed for microbial community composition, many sulfate reducers were found (Figure 4). The presence of sulfate-reducers suggested that the organic matrix and conditions inside the BCR were suitable for hosting these organisms. But, contrary to expectations, sulfate-reduction rates through the BCR were low. One possible explanation was that sulfate may be reducing to sulfide within the organics, but low metal ion concentrations were not enough to precipitate all soluble sulfide and it was re-oxidized to sulfate upon contact with oxygen diffusing down through the water column. Such a phenomenon was observed in the laboratory bioreactors before Fe2+ was added to the column bioreactor feed (Mirjafari et al., 2011). Performance since 2012 modifications Recharging of the BCR organics and increasing of the retention time resulted in improved performance (Table 1). The BCR was again visited in August 2013 and sampled for microbial community in the BCR. Each bar on the plot represents one type of microbe. They are colored according to the Order in which they are classified. Bacteria are classified in taxonomic groups at different levels: Phylum;Class;Order;Family;Genus;Species. Abundance refers to the number of sequences out of a total of 12000, 8000 and 12000 for samples taken in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Microbial community composition in 2013 A new technique was used called metagenomics. Instead of amplifying the SSU rRNA gene, which introduces possible biases, whole DNA was sequenced. From this we identified genes involved in sulfate metabolism, such as sulfate-reduction, and the types of bacteria that they came from, thus tying function to taxonomy. The results revealed that a psychrophilic organism, Desulfotalea psychrophilia , was the most prevalent sulfate-reducer in the BCR. Interestingly, this type of sulfate- reducer was first found in permanently cold Arctic marine sediments (Rabus et al., 2004), and even can survive at temperatures below 0oC. As before, the Desulfobacterales , Desulfovibrionales and Desulfuromonadales were bacteria taxa that were present in the BCR sediments. Presence of a healthy population of sulfate-reducers and detection of sulfide at the sediment/water interface (Table 2) coincided with active sulfate reduction and metal removal; although final sulfate concentrations were not meeting the 100mg/L discharge requirement. A very interesting phenomenon was noted by the operators during the colder months of 2013, when the BCR was covered with ice and snow. Higher concentrations of sulfide and lower concentrations of BCR effluent sulfate were measured in Spring than in Summer (Table 2). This suggested that sulfate-reduction was active even though temperatures of the BCR water were between 2.1 and 7.7oC. The cover of ice and snow on the surface of the BCR prevented oxygen from getting into the water layer as dissolved oxygen profiles with depth revealed (Figure 5). Improved anaerobic conditions correlated with improved sulfate-reduction. The average BCR influent sulfate 8 concentration in 2013 was 498mg/L. Sulfate-reduction was highest (35%) in April. Metal removal was also greatly improved in the Spring compared with the rest of the year (percent removal: Se (86%); Cu(56%); Mo(44%)). Presence of cold-adapted sulfate-reducers in the BCR, and active sulfate-reduction and metal removal supports the use of biological treatment in cold climates Table 2 Sulfate and sulfide concentrations measured in the BCR 486 488 469 481 493 Sulfides (mg/L) - Preserved with Zn-Acetate 31.6 14.5 0.71 1.23 0.085 0.01 0.106 5.1 Figure 5 Dissolved oxygen concentrations versus depth below the BCR water surface during winter and summer months. The BCR in 2014 During the most recent (26 August 2014) sampling of the sediment-water interface in the BCR, sulfide concentrations were higher than were measured in 2013 (August) (Table 2). The locations with higher sulfide concentrations coincided with lower sulfate concentrations. The North East side of the BCR (locations 3 and 4) was more active in terms of sulfate-reduction. Influent sulfate concentrations were 509mg/L. An extimated 15.6% sulfate is being reduced by the system.

At other sites algae have been found to host many microbes, such as sulfate-reducers, and their presence adds organic carbon to the BCR plus they can directly improve water quality (Das et al., 2009;Larratt et al., 2007). Sequencing revealed many types of unicellular algae, such as Dunaliella , in the water column. Sub-aqueous plants could be seen growing on the bottom near the edges (Figure 6). CONCLUSION A laboratory proof-of-concept test demonstrated that removal of sulfate and selenium to below the required levels for discharge was possible. The field-based BCR constructed at Mount Polley Mine using a woodchip, hay and manure organic mixture was found to successfully support an active sulfate-reducing microbial community and some removal of nitrite/nitrate, metals and sulfate was occurring. The system worked best immediately after the addition of fresh organics but thereafter appeared to decline in performance. Rapid depletion of readily available organic material may be a limiting issue for passive treatment and is it recommended that an upstream surge pond be included in future designs into which fresh organics can be added. The BCR was more successful in the colder months when ice and snow covered the water and improved anaerobic conditions inside the BCR. Thus, addition of a more impermeable cover may improve performance throughout the year.

A wide range of commercially available treatment solutions exist; however, op - erational requirements in many industries make most conventional technologies ex-pensive and difficult to comply with dis - charge criteria. Geosyntec has designed, constructed, and operated a semi-passive water treat-ment technology, Gravel Bed Reactors (GBR), for industrial and mining applica - tions. GBRs can treat a variety of water quality issues, including acidity, metals and metalloids, inorganics, and organic chemicals. The treatment of metals and inorganics in GBRs has focused on the use of anaerobic biological methods. Us - ing these methods, GBRs have demon - strated treatment of metals and inorganics to reduce concentration loading to surface water and / or reduce the requirement for conventional treatment, effectively provid - ing an alternate, cost effective treatment option for these constituents. Gravel Bed Reactors A GBR consists of an engineered bed of gravel / media through which wa - ter containing constituents of concern is passed and treated. For anaerobic bio - logical treatment, required amendments, such as electron donors and nutrients, are added to the water at the inlet of the GBR to promote the growth and activity of natural microbes capable of reducing the inorganics, sequentially immobilizing the metals in the gravel bed. GBRs are generally constructed within a natural de - pression or constructed cell near the water requiring treatment. The top and bottom of the treatment zone are lined using syn - thetic membranes to prevent water loss / influx, creating hydraulic isolation from the surrounding environment. GBR systems combine key positive design elements of existing, conventional bioreactor designs, including: 1. Control of the oxidation / reduction potential within the bioreactor by bal-ancing the addition of simple organic carbon (electron donor) with influent inorganics (electron acceptors) that al-lows the bioreactor to achieve the tar - get treatment with minimal production of biological solids; 2. Fixed media that supports a stable bio-film of naturally occurring bacteria that allow for robust operation of bioreac - tors and removal of excess solids with minimal maintenance requirements; 3.

Treatment of metals and inorganics While GBRs can treat a variety of wa - ter quality issues, in western Canada, re - cent water quality focuses on metals and By Silvia Mancini, Ph.D., P.Geo.; Evan Cox, M.Sc., Geosyntec Consultants International Inc. Construction of the Gravel Bed Reactor in California. A Water Treatment Technology for Industrial & Mining Applications Gravel Bed Reactors: 20 British Columbia Environment Industry AssociationW inorganics such as selenium and nitrate. Geosyntec and nitrate in GBRs to concentra - tions below target treatment levels using an - aerobic biological reduction. Denitrification is the microbially mediated mechanism by which nitrate concentrations in wastewater are reduced to nitrogen gas in GBR sys - tems. Selenium can be removed from water by reducing the soluble forms of selenate or selenite to elemental selenium, which can then be sorbed onto solid phases, pre - cipitated, or incorporated into the biomass within the GBR. Effective removal of se - lenium requires careful control of the geo - chemistry and oxidation / reduction poten - tial within the GBR. This is accomplished through precise regulation of the dose rate of electron donor substrate balanced with the concentration of electron acceptors in the influent water. Treated water quality can be further improved with a variety of simple filtration or polishing processes. Case studies Treatment in an Urban Stream, California: Geosyntec developed the design concept, detailed design, and implementation of a subsurface GBR sys - tem for treating water in an urban stream impacted by selenium. The GBR was designed to meet the requirements of the county's nitrogen and selenium manage-ment program at a flow rate of approximate - ly 700 m 3/d. Treatability and column studies were conducted by Geosyntec to confirm biological reduction of selenium and pro - vide design parameters for the GBR. During start-up operations, Geosyn- tec evaluated the selenium and nitrate treatment performance of the system, involving the approximation of plug-flow characteristics, sequestration of selenium, treatment of fecal indicator bacteria, and re-oxygenation of water prior to discharge. Testing occurred over extended durations, allowed for the characterization of short and mid-term operational conditions, and used extensive and varied testing proto - cols that informed the optimal operational conditions. At full operation, the GBR treatment system demonstrated the ca-pability to treat influent selenium con - centrations of approximately 40 ppb to below the California Toxic Rule freshwater chronic water quality criterion of five ppb, allowing for discharge of the effluent to an urban creek. This GBR accomplished treatment in a two-acre footprint compared to what would have been required (20 acres) for the al - ternative treatment under consideration (constructed wetland). The design of the subsurface GBR also allowed for property redevelopment on the land above, includ - ing its use as athletic fields for a school. Treatment at a Coal Mine, West Virginia: Geosyntec designed and oper - ated a GBR system for treatment of sele - nium and nitrate at a coal mine site in West Virginia, where surface water was impacted by selenium in newly exposed rock. The GBR was installed beneath an existing parking lot area to minimize the impact on other operations at the site. The excavation was lined with a geo-membrane liner and gravel was added, allowing the parking area to be re-installed above the GBR during its operation. Selenium-impacted surface water was amended with electron donor to provide food for the bacteria and added to the inlet of the GBR. The oxidation / reduction potential within the GBR was monitored to allow for adjustments in the dose of electron donor to maintain optimal conditions for removal of selenium. Dur - ing performance monitoring, the system consistently reduced the influent selenium concentration of approximately 30 ppb to below the target treatment level of five ppb. Conclusion GBRs offer simpler, less engineered systems compared to other anaerobic bi- ological treatment approaches, like water treatment facilities, packed bed bioreac - tors, and fluidized bed reactors. This in - cludes using less tankage and equipment, using waste materials (waste rock) as bio - reactor packing media, and a smaller treat - ment facility footprint. Less infrastructure allows easier installation of smaller sys - tems with the potential to treat water at or near the source. This is advantageous to industrial and mining operations in west - ern Canada with challenging locations and montane topography .

That's why we are taking action to ensure that water quality is protected in the valley now and for generations to come.Elk Valley Water Quality Plan: Five Year Update One of the most exciting advancements has come from our Research and Development program, which has developed a new form of water treatment using Saturated Rock Fills (SRF). Our first SRF has been commissioned at Elkview Operations and is achieving near complete removal of selenium and nitrate. SRF water treatment technology can help to achieve water quality objectives more quickly and efficiently than other forms of treatment. The SRF at Elkview is treating up to 10 million litres of water each day and we have plans to expand the Elkview SRF to treat 20 million litres per day.Over the five years since it was launched, significant progress has been made towards achieving the objectives of the Elk Valley Water Quality Plan, a long-term approach to address the management of substances released by mining activities in the Elk Valley. Our goal is to stabilize and reverse the trend of selenium and other substances to ensure the ongoing health of the watershed, while at the same time allowing for continued sustainable mining in the region. The first water treatment facility was built and is now successfully operating at our Line Creek Operations. We are applying what we've learned to build a larger tank-based plant which is under construction now at our Fording River Operations. As a result, we are seeing reductions in selenium and nitrate concentrations downstream of the Line Creek facility and we expect further significant reductions in other areas as future facilities come on line. The Challenge Water quality challenges in the Elk Valley are connected to the long history of mining in the region. The mining process generates large quantities of leftover rock that contains naturally-occurring substances such as selenium, an element that is essential for human and animal health in small amounts. Water from both precipitation and runoff flows through these rock piles and carries selenium and other substances, such as nitrate, into the local watershed. If present in high enough concentrations in the watershed, these substances can adversely affect aquatic health.

Biological treatment t o convert dissolved forms of selenium to solid form 2. Nitrate is conv erted into inert nitrogen gas and safely released 3. Solid selenium is extract ed and safely disposed of in a secure onsite facility 4. Safely tr eated water is discharged Saturated Rock Fill Saturated Rock Fills use naturally-occurring biological processes in former mining areas that have been backfilled with rock and saturated with water to remove selenium and nitrate: 1. Water f or treatment is injected into the SRF 2. Natural bact eria convert dissolved forms of selenium into a solid form which remains securely stored in the SRF and nitrate to inert nitrogen gas which is safely released 3. Safely tr eated water is pumped out of the SRF and discharged The benefits of SRF over other forms of water treatment: Quicker to build and less complex to operate Lower cost and more sustainable Treat larger volumes of water Use less energy Smaller environmental footprint Water Diversions Clean water diversions involve the construction of earthen dikes, channels or other physical barriers and/or pipes to direct clean water around mining activities.

To date, regional monitoring indicates that current levels of selenium and other substances are not impacting populations of fish or birds. Monitoring shows that selenium concentrations have been reduced downstream of our operational water treatment plant at Line Creek as a result of water treatment and we expect further significant reductions as the Fording and Elkview facilities come on line. Sharing Monitoring Results Teck is committed to being transparent with stakeholders as we implement the Elk Valley Water Quality Plan. We make data and results from ongoing water quality, aquatic and animal health research and monitoring undertaken as part of the Plan available, and we will continue to share those results going forward. This includes Annual Reports completed by an Environmental Monitoring Committee comprised of an independent scientist and representatives from the B.C. Government, Ktunaxa Nation Council, Interior Health Authority, and Teck. Monitoring reports related to the Elk Valley Water Quality Plan can be found at: teck.com/elkvalley Research and Development Teck is investing $30 million this year in over 20 research and development projects. These include projects to continue to improve our understanding of water quality, source control and treatment options. Three examples of this work are: Alternative treatment technologies We are exploring the use of smaller water treatment facilities that can be built much closer to where the treatment is needed. Nitrate prevention This includes using liners that prevent explosives that contain nitrate - used in the mining process - from coming in contact with water. Waste Rock Covers We are continuing to evaluate different forms of physical covers for waste rock piles ranging from vegetative to geosynthetic covers. Community Engagement Throughout 2019, we'll be providing opportunities for you to learn more about the Elk Valley Water Quality Plan, our progress and our challenges, and to provide input into the ongoing implementation of the plan. The Elk Valley Water Quality Plan is an adaptive plan that will continue to be updated based on new technology and learnings as well as feedback we receive along the way. We will be holding public information sessions in the region in Fall 2019.

You can find our previous reports at www.teck.com/ElkValley . Teck's environmental monitoring programs in the Elk Valley produce a lot of complex information. We've done our best to highlight what we feel are the important findings in Teck's results and analyses from 2018. The technical reports that form the basis of our summary are available to the public, and you can access them if you wish. We've provided a list of these reports, and directions on where to find them, at the end of this report. This was another busy and productive year for our committee. We met five times in person for a week each time and had 15 conference calls. We reviewed 65 reports, study designs, and data packages, and provided 1,442 pieces of technical advice to Teck and the Director, Regional Operations Branch, Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. We are proud to be members of this committee and we are committed to providing scientific recommendations to improve, broaden, and support environmental monitoring in the Elk Valley. In conjunction with the release of this report, we hold an annual public meeting. This meeting is intended to give you an opportunity to ask us questions about the information we have reviewed. We hope that you are able to find and understand information about water quality in the Elk Valley that is important to you.

Monitoring results indicate that the concentrations of these substances are increasing in areas impacted by mining in the Elk Valley. In April 2013, the British Columbia Minister of Environment issued Ministerial Order No. M113 that required Teck to develop an area-based management plan and to identify the actions it will take to manage water quality downstream of its five steelmaking coal mines. The mine-related substances of concern in that order are selenium, nitrate, sulphate, cadmium, and calcite. Between 2013 and 2014 Teck developed the Elk Valley Water Quality Plan with feedback from the public, First Nations, provincial and federal governments, technical experts, and other stakeholders. Teck submitted the Elk Valley Water Quality Plan to the Minister in July 2014 and it was approved in November that same year. The Elk Valley Water Quality Plan guides water quality management in the Elk Valley and has these four environmental objectives: protect aquatic ecosystem health manage bioaccumulation of mine-related substances in the environment protect human health protect groundwater The El k Valley Water Quality Plan, or EVWQP, has targets (limits) for the concentration of selenium, sulphate, nitrate, and cadmium in surface water at seven specific locations\u2014called order stations 1\u2014in the Elk Valley and in the Koocanusa Reservoir. The EVWQP also has targets for the amount of calcite in streams influenced by mining. These water quality targets\u2014both short-term (2014 to 2019), medium-term (2020 to 2025), and long-term\u2014are meant to first stabilize and then decrease concentrations over time to protect the most sensitive aquatic life and human health from mining-related effects on water quality. You can learn more about the Elk Valley Water Quality Plan here: https://www.teck.com/media/2015-Water-elk_ valley_water_quality_plan_T3.2.3.2.pdf 1These seven locations were specified in Ministerial Order No. 113, which is why they are referred to as \"order stations\". Elk Valley Water Quality Plan 7 7The Elk Valley Permit Following the approval of the Elk Valley Water Quality Plan, the Ministry of Environment issued Permit 107517\u2014often called the Elk Valley Permit. Many of the actions and commitments described in the Elk Valley Water Quality Plan were made legal requirements by this permit, including the target concentrations for water quality. Teck must meet all the requirements in this permit. Permit 107517 does not replace any of the permits previously issued to each of the mine operations. It is regionally focused and adds another layer of legal requirements for Teck. You can can find more information about Permit 107517 on the BC government website: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/waste- management/waste-discharge-authorization/search-status-and-documentsWater Quality Targets Water quality targets are limits for the amount of selenium, sulphate, nitrate, and cadmium in the water. These targets are meant to protect aquatic life based on available data during the development of the Elk Valley Water Quality Plan. There are two types of water quality targets in Permit 107517: compliance limits and site performance objectives. We refer to both of these as permit limits in this report. Compliance limits are set for compliance points. Compliance points are water monitoring stations that are downstream from each of Teck's mine operations in the Elk Valley. These points correspond to stream locations where all or most of the mine-influenced water accumulates from an operation. There are eight compliance points. Site performance objectives are set for order stations. Order stations are water monitoring stations that are further downstream from Teck's mining operations where water that is mine-influenced is mixed with water that is not. Because of this mixing, concentrations at order stations are expected to be lower than at compliance points. There are seven order stations. 8 | 2019 Environmental Monitoring Committee Public Report | How Teck Manages Water Quality in the Elk Valley \"\" \"\"%,%,%,%, %, %,%,%,%,%,%, %, \\\\teckcominco.loc\\cgo\\Groups\\TCGIS\\Data\\Projects\\WaterQualityStations\\Figure1-1LocationsofOps&MonitoringLocations.mxd%, Ministry Order Stations Compliance Stations Mine Operations Elk Valley Watershed Boundary Figure 1. Compliance points, order stations, and boundaries of Permit 107517 in the Elk Valley. 9The Environmental Monitoring Committee Permit 107517 requires Teck to form an Environmental Monitoring Committee (EMC). In 2018, the members of this committee included: an independent aquatic scientist two representatives from the British Columbia Ministry of Env ironment and Climate Change Strategy (ENV) one representative from the British Columbia Ministry of Ene rgy, Mines, and Petroleum Resources (EMPR) one representative from the Interior Health Authori ty (IHA) two representatives from the Ktunaxa Nation Counci l (KNC) two representatives from Teck The fe deral government (Environment and Climate Change Canada) has been invited to participate on the committee, but has declined active participation. Federal representatives have, however, agreed to consider requests from the EMC to provide specific input on a case-by-case basis. Permit 107517 also states that the Environmental Monitoring Committee must review these monitoring and management programs: Monitoring Programs Surface Water Monitoring Groundwater Monitoring Calcite Monitoring Local Aquatic Effects Monitoring Regional Aquatic Effects Monitoring Toxicity Testing Human Health Risk Assessment Mana gement Programs Adaptive Management Tributary ManagementAll of t hese programs are required under Permit 107517 and are focused on the Elk River watershed and the Canadian portion of the Koocanusa Reservoir. The Environmental Monitoring Committee reviews all the information associated with these programs and provides advice to Teck. It is up to Teck to respond to or adopt the committee's advice. These programs are strengthened by the advice the committee provides. The Environmental Monitoring Committee cannot approve Teck's programs. And it does not replace or affect the consultation process between the BC provincial government and First Nations. The members on the Environmental Monitoring Committee have different areas of expertise and bring different perspectives to the committee's discussions about Teck's monitoring and management programs. The committee provides technical advice and the KNC representatives also provide advice relating to the Ktunaxa's stewardship principles and worldview. Ktunaxa Stewardship Archaeological evidence indicates that for more than 10,000 years the Ktunaxa (pronounced 'k-too-nah-ha') people have occupied the lands along the Kootenay and Columbia Rivers, and the Arrow Lakes of British Columbia. The Ktunaxa Territory is divided into Land Districts, and the Elk Valley falls within one of these districts, called Qukin ?amak?is, or Raven's Land. The Ktunaxa people have continuously used and occupied the Elk Valley area within Qukin ?amak?is, and the formation of the geography of the Elk Valley is described in the final events of the Ktunaxa Creation story. Because of the Ktunaxa's deep connection to the Elk Valley, the Ktunaxa Nation Council (KNC) has been invited to have three representatives on the EMC to provide both science-based advice and advice relating to the Ktunaxa's stewardship principles and worldview. Information about the Ktunaxa Nation, the Ktunaxa creation story, and Ktunaxa law has been provided by KNC and can be found in Appendix A.10 | 2019 Environmental Monitoring Committee Public Report | How Teck Manages Water Quality in the Elk ValleyWho is the Director? The Director is the representative from the regional government office within the British Columbia Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy that is responsible for issuing permits under the Environmental Management Act and for determining compliance with permit requirements. All the study designs, plans, and reports required under Permit 107517 are submitted to the Director, many of which require written acceptance or approval.Projecting Future Water Quality To examine and understand how activities at its five coal mines affect water quality, Teck has developed a regional water quality model. This model simulates how historical, current, and future mining activities affect the concentrations of selenium, sulphate, nitrate, and cadmium in the Elk Valley and the Koocanusa Reservoir. It also simulates how the various mitigation measures Teck has planned (water treatment and clean-water diversions for example) will affect water quality. The model uses historical and current information to project future concentrations. Teck developed the first regional water quality model in 2014 to inform the EVWQP. Teck is required to update the model every three years, and the first update was submitted to the Director in October 2017. The water quality projections mentioned later in this report are taken from the 2017 model. Work on the next update is underway and is due to the Director in October 2020. The EMC does not provide advice on the water quality model or its development, but it does review the model's outputs. This information is helpful to the EMC when members are reviewing and providing advice on Teck's monitoring and management programs. The initial implementation plan in the EVWQP was based on the 2014 regional water quality model. The updated projections and schedules for active water treatment in the 2017 model required Teck to subsequently update the EVWQP implementation plan. Teck has now finalized the 2019 Implementation Plan Adjustment and it can be found at https://www.teck.com/responsibility/sustainability-topics/water/water-quality-in-the-elk-valley/news-and-publications/ .11Adaptive Management Adaptive management is an approach to environmental management that helps environmental managers make progress towards environmental goals, while at the same time allowing them to incorporate learnings along the way. Adaptive management combines research with management actions to help managers systematically test assumptions, learn, and adapt. Teck is required to develop and implement an adaptive management plan. Teck began developing the plan in early 2015 and submitted it to the Director in August 2016. The KNC and Teck requested an extension to make sure the document was acceptable to KNC. Following several rounds of discussions with the EMC, Teck submitted the most recent version of the plan to the Director in December 2018. It was formally accepted by the Director in May 2019. The adaptive management plan was developed to support the implementation of the EVWQP to achieve water quality and calcite targets; to ensure that human health and the environment are protected (and where necessary, restored); and to facilitate the continuous improvement of water quality in the Elk Valley. Following the six stage adaptive management cycle (see text box), Teck's adaptive management plan is guided by six management questions that will be evaluated through the implementation of the EVWQP. The six management questions identified in Teck's 2018 Adaptive Management Plan are: Management Question 1: Will water quality limits and site performance objectives be met for selenium, nitrate, sulphate, and cadmium? Management Question 2: Will the aquatic ecosystem be protected by meeting the long- term site performance objectives? Management Question 3: Are the combinations of methods for controlling selenium, nitrate, sulphate, and cadmium included in the implementation plan the most effective for meeting limits and site performance objectives?What is Adaptive Management? It is a systematic, rigorous approach to environmental management structured around a six stage management cycle (a form of the plan-do-check-act management loop). It focuses on learning about important uncertainties, while at the same time implementing management actions based on the current understanding. It provides a framework in which management actions are adapted based on what is learned. 3 IMPLEMENT 4 MONITOR5 EVALUATE6 ADJUST2 DESIGN1 ASSESS Adaptive Management Cycle12 | 2019 Environmental Monitoring Committee Public Report | How Teck Manages Water Quality in the Elk ValleyManagement Question 4: Is calcite being managed effectively to meet site performance objectives and protect the aquatic ecosystem? Management Question 5: Does monitoring indicate that mine-related changes in aquatic ecosystem conditions are consistent with expectations? Management Question 6: Is water quality being managed to be protective of human health? The 2018 plan also identifies continuous improvement goals for each management question and a response framework for determining when additional mitigation actions or other adjustments may be needed to protect the aquatic ecosystem and human health. Teck is required to submit an annual report that describes the activities undertaken during the previous year in each stage of the adaptive management cycle. Following the Director's acceptance of Teck's 2018 Adaptive Management Plan, Teck submitted its first annual report in July 2019. In addition to a description of activities undertaken, the annual report summarized the results and learnings from 2018 and described Teck's next steps. Teck is also required to update its adaptive management plan every three years. The next update is due in December 2021. Teck continues to work with the EMC to develop a means of tracking progress towards continuous improvement goals; to develop and implement additional triggers to the response framework (groundwater and calcite, for example); and to develop definitions of unacceptable conditions for integration in the response framework. The EMC will continue to review and provide advice on the three-year plan update and the annual reports. 13What We Learned From the Monitoring Programs in 201814 | 2019 Environmental Monitoring Committee Public Report | What We Learned From the Monitoring Programs in 2018Surface Water Quality In addition to the eight compliance points and the seven order stations, Teck routinely monitors water quality at 88 other locations in the Elk Valley. All monitoring results are used to evaluate Teck's compliance with its permit requirements and its progress towards achieving the objectives set in the Elk Valley Water Quality Plan. For compliance points and order stations: results for selenium, nitrate, sulphate, and cadmium are comp ared to permit limits results for other mine-related substances are compared to BC wat er quality guidelines For the 88 other monitoring locations: results for selenium, nitrate, sulphate, and cadmium are compare d to BC water quality guidelines results for other mine-related substances are compared to BC wat er quality guidelines Monitoring results are presented in an annual report that Teck submits to the Director and the EMC in March every year. 2 2Permit 107517 Annual Water Quality Monitoring Report, 2018 (March 2019)15Compliance Permit 107517 has specific targets (limits) for the concentration of selenium, nitrate, sulphate, and cadmium at the compliance points and order stations, and Teck is required to meet these limits to be in compliance. Water quality in the Elk Valley is affected by several factors including background conditions, the placement of waste rock, annual and seasonal rain and snow (and the resulting surface flows, or hydrology), water treatment, and how the operations manage water. Changes to these factors influence whether or not a location is in compliance with the limits set in Permit 107517. In 2018, Teck maintained compliance at the compliance points and order stations for 88.5% of water samples tested. There were recurring exceedances of permit limits at two compliance points: FRCP1, a site on the upper Fording River; and LCDSSLCC, a site on Line Creek. One order station, DSELK in the Koocanusa Reservoir near the confluence of the Elk River, reported a non- compliance for the average concentration of selenium in the month of April. Fording River (FRCP1) The FRCP1 location is a compliance point on the upper Fording River, approximately 525 m downstream of Cataract Creek. It is intended to capture the mixed water of the Fording River and all tributaries (both mine-influenced and not mine-influenced) that flow into it. One of those tributaries, Cataract Creek, is influenced by waste rock at the Fording River Operations. From October to December 2018, mixed water in the Fording River flowed underground leaving only water from Cataract Creek flowing past the compliance point. Water samples collected at this compliance point during this time were representative of Cataract Creek, not mixed waters in the Fording River. Changes in hydrology and undiluted waste rock runoff were important drivers of the selenium, nitrate, and sulphate exceedances at FRCP1 in 2018 (Figures 3 to 5). Teck has been monitoring the aquatic biota downstream of this location to evaluate whether the biota is being affected by these higher concentrations through the winter months. Teck and the EMC continue to review these results. To reduce the concentrations of mine-related substances in the Fording River, Teck is currently constructing an active water treatment facility just south of the Fording River Operations. The facility start up will commence late 2020 with a ramp up to full operation in 2021. This facility will treat water from Cataract Creek, Swift Creek, and Kilmarnock Creek. Figure 2.

In February 2018, the facility was temporarily shut down to add an advanced oxidation process (see page 39 for more information). In the three months that followed, selenium concentrations in Line Creek were above permit limits. The treatment facility was restarted in October 2018 and selenium concentrations at the Line Creek compliance point returned to below permit limits (Figure 6). Nitrate concentrations also exceeded permit limits at this location in 2018 (Figure 7). The treatment facility removes 90% of the nitrate, but concentrations in Line Creek remained close to, or slightly above the permit limits. Teck continues to monitor and assess the potential effects of these nitrate levels to the aquatic biota in Line Creek. See page 39 for more information on these monitoring results.

Koocanusa Reservoir (DSELK) The DSELK location is an order station in the Koocanusa Reservoir just downstream of the confluence of the Elk River. It is intended to capture the mixed water of the Kootenay River and the Elk River. In April 2018, the reservoir at this location was a river channel running through the bottom of the reservoir. The April water samples were collected from the eastern river bank and the average selenium concentration in April was 2.7 \u00b5g/L; the monthly average limit is 2 \u00b5g/L (Figure 8).

Teck discovered that the eastern shoreline primarily represented water from the Elk River and the western shoreline represented water from the Kootenay River. See page 43 for more information. 19Results Above BC Water Quality Guidelines BC water quality guidelines are science-based benchmarks intended to protect the most sensitive life stages of the most sensitive aquatic species occurring in the province. These guidelines are policy; they are not enforceable standards. The guidelines are developed by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy for consideration in decision making. Results above a BC water quality guideline may or may not result in changes to aquatic biota, depending on site-specific conditions and the sensitivities of the local aquatic biota.Teck collected approximately 1400 water samples in 2018 and compared the laboratory results to the BC water quality guidelines: 24 of 1400 samples taken (1.7%) measured above the alumin um guideline \u00b0 no spat ial or temporal patterns \u00b0 has not i ncreased over time \u00b0 not rel ated to mining operations 79 of 1400 samples taken (5.6%) measured above the iron g uideline \u00b0 occur red at the peak of spring melt \u00b0 no spati al pattern \u00b0 has not i ncreased over time 160 of 1400 samples taken (11.4%) measured above the mercu ry guideline \u00b0 occur red at the peak of spring melt \u00b0 no spati al pattern \u00b0 has not i ncreased over time \u00b0 not rel ated to mining operations 51 of 1400 samples taken (3.6%) measured above the cobalt gu ideline \u00b0 occur red in Corbin Creek and Michel Creek \u00b0 has incr eased over time \u00b0 relate d to mining operations 15 of 1400 samples taken (1.1%) measured above the nitrite guideline \u00b0 occur red mainly in Corbin Creek (11) and Michel Creek (2) \u00b0 has incr eased over time \u00b0 relate d to mining operations 66 of 1400 samples taken (4.7%) measured above the uranium guideline \u00b0 occur red mainly in West Line Creek (54) upstream of the active water treatment facility \u00b0 also fou nd in Fording River (9), Corbin Creek (2), and Greenhills Creek (1) \u00b0 relate d to mining operations 20 | 2019 Environmental Monitoring Committee Public Report | What We Learned From the Monitoring Programs in 2018Trends in Water Quality Teck continually evaluates its monitoring results to look for trends. Teck then compares those trends to what was projected in the Regional Water Quality Model. If a trend is unexpected, Teck investigates the cause. If the cause is determined to be mining-related, Teck will evaluate options and take appropriate management actions. Teck reports water quality trends in the annual report it submits to the Director and the EMC in March every year.3 The four mine-related substances identified in the EVWQP\u2014selenium, nitrate, sulphate, cadmium\u2014are the main substances of concern, but nickel and cobalt have recently emerged as additional substances of concern in localized areas. Selenium Selenium is a common element found naturally in rock, and it is an essential nutrient for all living things at low concentrations. In water, selenium is taken up by algae and other microorganisms and transferred through the food web where it accumulates in the body tissues of aquatic invertebrates, fish, birds, and other vertebrates\u2014this is called bioaccumulation. When selenium accumulates at high concentrations in the tissues of animals, it can interfere with their reproduction, especially in animals that lay eggs such as fish, birds, amphibians, and reptiles. In humans, long-term exposure to elevated selenium can result in fever, nausea, and selenosis. Selenosis is characterized by multiple organ damage, especially the liver and skin. Selenium concentrations in the Elk Valley have increased over time and have exceeded permit limits at three locations (see the Compliance section on page 15). The Regional Water Quality model projected selenium concentrations would exceed permit limits at certain locations until the commissioning of the Fording River South Active Water Treatment Facility (Figure 9). Teck expects the commissioning of the Elkview Saturated Rockfill Facility (start-up will commence late 2020 with a ramp up to full operation in 2021) will further improve water quality by decreasing selenium (and nitrate) concentrations in Erickson Creek, Michel Creek, and the Elk River. 3Permit 107517 Annual Water Quality Monitoring Report, 2018 (March 2019) 21Figure 9.

Nitrate is a key component of the explosives used in mining. It is carried by water from waste rock piles into streams and rivers. High concentrations of nitrate in the water may be harmful to fish and other aquatic organisms by disrupting their ability to use oxygen. This harms their growth and development, particularly during the early life stages (as larvae or eggs, for example). In humans, nitrates are a particular concern for babies and pregnant women. Exposure to high levels of nitrates reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood resulting in a condition called methemoglobinemia. High concentrations of nitrate in the water can also contribute to excessive plant growth (eutrophication). Concentrations of nitrate in the Elk Valley have been increasing over time, but levels are currently below permit limits\u2014except for two locations: the Fording River compliance point and the Line Creek compliance point (see page 15 in the Compliance section for more information). The Regional Water Quality Model projects that once the Fording River South Active Water Treatment Facility is operational (facility start up will commence late 2020 with a ramp up to full operation in 2021), nitrate concentrations in the Fording River will be below permit limits, with some seasonal variability (during some months the concentrations will not meet the limits). The Regional Water Quality Model projects that Teck will reach compliance with its nitrate limits in Line Creek by 2025 when the West Line Creek Active Water Treatment Facility is expanded (Figure 10). Teck has made a significant effort over the past year across all operations to reduce nitrate loading in the receiving environment by increasing the use of plastic liners during blasting. Liners help to reduce the loss of explosive emulsion to fissures in the rock and improve combustion. This means less residual nitrate ends up in the waste rock. Because nitrate takes years to move through spoils, it will take time to measure the benefits of these improvements in Elk Valley waters. The EMC does not review or provide advice related to Teck's nitrate management activities. 23Figure 10.

When exposed to high sulphate in water, aquatic invertebrates experience impaired regulation of bodily fluids, and high sulphate levels can be harmful to fish and other aquatic organisms. Sulphates in humans may have a laxative effect (cause diarrhea) that can lead to dehydration; this is of particular concern for infants. Concentrations of sulphate in the Elk Valley have been increasing over time, but have been below permit limits\u2014 with the exception of the Fording River compliance point (see page 15 in the Compliance section for more information). The concentrations of sulphate are projected to continue increasing, but they are projected to remain below permit limits\u2014except at the Fording River compliance point and the Line Creek compliance point. Sulphate concentrations at the Fording River compliance point are projected to be above the permit limit by 2027 and at the Line Creek compliance point by 2026 (Figure 11). There is uncertainty about the breadth of potential risks that projected sulphate concentrations may cause for aquatic life, so Teck was required to study the toxicity of sulphate to better understand this. The EMC provided input and review of this study (see page 41). 25Figure 11.

It is released during mining and it is found in the waste rock at certain locations in the Elk Valley. Cadmium can be harmful in aquatic environments at very low concentrations. At this time there is inadequate evidence to state whether or not cadmium has the potential to cause cancer from lifetime exposures through drinking water. The permit limit for cadmium is the BC water quality guideline and this varies with water hardness. The guideline is approximately 0.6 \u00b5g/L when water hardness is 400 mg/L (upper Fording River) and approximately 0.35 \u00b5g/L when water hardness is 200 mg/L (in the lower Elk River). Concentrations of cadmium throughout the Elk Valley are below permit limits and do not appear to be increasing over time. There are some seasonal trends, but these appear to be driven by background conditions. There are elevated concentrations in some tributaries influenced by mining activities, but these concentrations are still below the permit limits. The concentration of cadmium at the order stations has been below 0.1 mg/L. 27Nickel Nickel is a common, naturally-occurring metallic element. Although it does not accumulate in fish, plants, or animals, nickel does accumulate in soils and sediments and may have an adverse effect on aquatic life when concentrations are high in the water. In the Elk Valley, nickel concentrations are below the BC guideline. The concentrations are higher at localized areas in Corbin Creek downstream of Coal Mountain Operations and in Michel Creek, but still remain below the guideline (Figure 12). The BC guideline for nickel is 150 \u00b5g/L, but Teck\u2014through additional monitoring programs\u2014has measured adverse responses to sensitive benthic invertebrates at concentrations ranging from 5 to 22 \u00b5g/L. Teck notified ENV, EMC, EC, and KNC of this finding and continues to monitor and review the results with the EMC. Teck is currently working on developing an updated site-specific nickel screening value that will protect sensitive invertebrates. The EMC will be asked for input as this progresses. Teck is also evaluating water treatment options for nickel. 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 20191090110 305070130150190 170 CM_CC1 Measured Total Nickel 30-day Average BCWQG Working Average LimitNickel (\u00b5g/L) 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019075 2550100150 125 CM_MC2 Measured Total Nickel 30-day Average BCWQG Working Average LimitNickel (\u00b5g/L) Figure 12.

See map on page 8. 28 | 2019 Environmental Monitoring Committee Public Report | What We Learned From the Monitoring Programs in 2018Cobalt Cobalt is a naturally-occurring element that is found in small amounts in rocks, soil, water, plants, and animals, often combined with other elements. It is an essential nutrient for humans at low concentrations and is an important component of the vitamin B12. But like selenium, too much cobalt can have adverse health effects for humans, including serious impacts on the heart and thyroid. The maximum concentrations of cobalt observed at a localized level in Corbin Creek downstream of the Coal Mountain Operations and in Michel Creek were below the BC guideline of 110 \u00b5g/L. But the long-term average was above the BC guideline of 4 \u00b5g/L, and concentrations have been increasing over time (Figure 13). Along with nickel, Teck is looking into water treatment options for cobalt. 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019Cobalt Concentration Corbin Creek (\u00b5g/L) 015 5102030 25 CM_CC1 Measured Total Cobalt 30-day Average BCWQG Approved Average LimitCobalt (\u00b5g/L) 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019015 510203025 CM_MC2 Measured Total Cobalt 30-day Average BCWQG Approved Average LimitCobalt (\u00b5g/L) Figure 13.

See map on page 8. 29Calcite Calcite is a common component of sedimentary rock, particularly limestone, and is made up of calcium carbonate - a calcium salt. Calcium carbonate is very common; it is the main building block of animal shells and is the white crust that builds up on the bottom of your tea kettle. As water travels through rock (both underground and on the surface), calcite in the rock dissolves and the calcium carbonate is carried into streams and rivers. Here the calcium carbonate can recrystallize and form a thin layer of calcite on the streambed. This process does occur naturally in streams, but mining operations have the potential to increase the rate, extent, and depth of the formation of calcite when water passes through waste rock piles. When that thin layer of calcite on the streambed builds up over time, it starts to form a calcite crust that can cement gravel and rocks together, degrading habitat for fish and aquatic insects. The degree of degradation can vary as shown in Figures 14 to 16. Annual Calcite Monitoring Teck has been monitoring calcite levels in the Elk Valley annually since 2014. In 2018, 100 rocks at each of 312 sites on 117 stream reaches were surveyed, and 354 km of stream were assessed and mapped. The surveys measure the presence of calcite and the level of concretion (how cemented the rocks are to the streambed) to generate a calcite index between 0 and 3. Figure 15. A fully concreted streambed in Porter Creek. This reach has a calcite index of 3. Figure 14. Range of values for the calcite index.Significant concretion Highest possible level; streambedfully calciteobserved3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0Calcite IndexCalcite Index Value30 | 2019 Environmental Monitoring Committee Public Report | What We Learned From the Monitoring Programs in 2018Figure 16. Calcite distribution (by percent of stream kilometres surveyed) in the Elk and Fording Rivers (left) and tributaries (right) from 2014 to 2018. Permit 107517 describes the site performance objectives for calcite in streams that are fish-bearing, provide fish habitat, or flow directly into fish-bearing streams: By December 2024, Teck must achieve calcite concretion of less t han 0.50. This means at least 50% of rocks sampled within the reach have no concretion (are not stuck to the stream bed). By December 2029, Teck must achieve a total calcite index of less than 0.5. This is the level of calcite that is found naturally in streams unaffected by mining. Mine-Exposed Rivers in 2014Reference Sites (all years) Mine-Exposed Rivers in 2015 Mine-Exposed Rivers in 2016 Mine-Exposed Tributaries in 2014Reference Tributaries (all years) Mine-Exposed Tributaries in 2015 Mine-Exposed Tributaries in 2016 Mine-Exposed has been an increase in calcite over time in the Elk Valley. The results show that the percent of kilometers with a calcite index between 0 and 0.5 is decreasing over time in both streams and creeks (tributaries) and in the Fording and Elk rivers (main stems), while the percent of kilometres in the main stems with a calcite index between 0.51 and 1.00 is increasing (Figure 16). The majority of mine-affected areas that Teck has sampled had low levels of calcite (calcite index values ranging between 0 and 0.5) and this is consistent with streams that have not been influenced by mining (reference streams). Of the 288 kilometres of mine-exposed rivers and tributaries surveyed in 2018, 85.8 kilometres (30%) of these are impacted by calcite at levels higher than background. 4 4Calcite Monitoring Program 2018 Annual Report31Biological Effects of Calcite Teck has been conducting studies since 2015 to learn about the potential effects of calcite on the aquatic environment. The first study focused on the effects of calcite in streams on aquatic insects (mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies) and algae. The results showed that the average percent of mayfly larvae in the insect community tended to decrease to below the regional reference normal range when calcite index values were above 1. However, areas having a calcite index greater than 1 also tended to have elevated concentrations of selenium, nitrate, and/or sulphate above benchmarks. Therefore, the effects of calcite could not be distinguished from those associated with water quality (that is, in areas where effects are observed, the effects may be due to calcite or water quality, or both, depending on the area). The second phase (2016 and 2017) of the study focused on the relationship between calcite index and incubation conditions for fish eggs laid in the gravel on the bottom of the streams. While calcite was found to have some effect on the amount of oxygen available in the gravels, the effects on incubation conditions are predicted at depths deeper than the typical depths of the eggs and at sites with calcite concretion that may prevent fish from being able to dig their nests (redds). The third phase of the study (2018) focused on finding a link between calcite formation on the streambed and the suitability of spawning habitat for Westslope Cutthroat Trout (measured by the presence of redds and the density of redds within a stream). In five streams sampled within the upper Fording River watershed, redds were found across the full range of calcite index values up to 1.7. However, the current data suggests there may be an influence of calcite on redd density. These results are preliminary and are based on a small sample size, so more study is needed to better understand the effect of higher calcite index values on redd presence (are they there?) and density (how many are there?). What is a redd? A redd is a fish nest. Certain species of fish\u2014like trout and salmon\u2014use their tails to scoop out a hollow in the gravel of a streambed. The female lays her eggs in this hollow, the male fertilizes them, and the female covers the eggs with gravel.Managing Calcite Teck is required to manage the formation of calcite and reduce calcite levels in mine-affected streams in the Elk Valley. Since October 2017, Teck has been applying antiscalant (a chemical compound that prevents calcite particles from forming) in Lower Greenhills Creek to prevent new calcite from forming on the streambed. The calcite index value in 2018 for Lower Greenhills Creek has not changed from 2017 suggesting that the antiscalant is successful in preventing new calcite from forming. However, based on recent research, antiscalant does not remove existing calcite from the streambed. Teck will continue to pursue other technologies for removing calcite. Teck is also required to monitor water quality and aquatic effects downstream of any calcite treatments. Monitoring results from 2018 showed no negative effects on water quality in, or downstream, of Lower Greenhills Creek, and showed no toxicity effects related to the antiscalant. Teck will continue monitoring this calcite treatment system to better understand its effectiveness and to determine what the results might mean for calcite treatment in other creeks. The EMC doesn't review studies or plans related to calcite management, but it does review the results of the water quality and aquatic monitoring that Teck conducts downstream of calcite treatments.32 | 2019 Environmental Monitoring Committee Public Report | What We Learned From the Monitoring Programs in 2018Groundwater Quality In the Elk Valley, groundwater generally flows below the surface in shallow sand and gravel aquifers, parallel to streams and rivers (surface water). Mining influences on groundwater can occur through two main pathways (Figure 17): Groundwater pathway: Mine- related substances infiltrate the ground from mine sources (such as waste rock, process plants, and settling ponds) and influence aquifers close to mining operations. In areas where this is the main pathway, concentrations of mine-related substances in groundwater are expected to be higher than in nearby surface water.

Pathways for mining influences on groundwater. Surface water pathway: Mine-in fluenced surface water interacts with aquifers in the valley bottoms. In areas where this is the main pathway, concentrations of mine-related substances in groundwater are expected to be equal to or less than nearby surface water because of mixing with freshwater sources. The surface water pathway is believed to be the main pathway for transporting mine-related substances to groundwater on a regional scale. The majority of groundwater receptors (drinking water, livestock, and wildlife) are influenced by this pathway in the valley-bottoms. As surface water quality improves through treatment, groundwater quality is also expected to improve. 33What is an aquifer? An aquifer is a geological formation where groundwater can flow and be stored. Aquifers can be located right below the ground surface or very deep underground. They can be very large or quite small. They consist of layers of sand, gravel, or bedrock that is saturated with water. To better understand the potential effects of mining operations on groundwater and the interactions between surface water and groundwater, Teck carries out six monitoring programs in the Elk Valley. There are five site-specific groundwater monitoring programs (one at each mine operation) and a regional groundwater monitoring program. The site-specific programs focus on the potential sources of mine-related substances and identify the transport pathways to the valley bottoms of the Elk River, the Fording River, and Michel Creek. The regional program focuses on the groundwater flow paths within the valley bottom and how they relate to the receptors. The EMC reviews and provides advice on the regional program. There is a groundwater working group that is linked to the EMC, which provides particular expertise on this topic. The regional groundwater monitoring program identified twelve study areas in the Elk Valley where there may be transport of mine-related substances to groundwater in the valley bottom. Every three months Teck collects water samples and groundwater elevations from 37 wells in the study areas. The water samples are analyzed in a laboratory and the results are compared against BC guidelines for drinking water, aquatic life, livestock, and irrigation (primary screening criteria) and site performance objectives and compliance point concentrations for selenium (secondary screening criteria). Groundwater chemistry is compared to chemistry at nearby surface water stations to increase understanding of surface water and groundwater interactions. Measuring groundwater levels helps to understand groundwater flow direction and seasonal changes in aquifer storage. Teck now has four years of regional groundwater results. In general, results from 2018 (Figure 18 and 19) were relatively similar to previous years. Teck's Drinking Water Monitoring Program Teck offers private well owners in the Elk Valley the opportunity to have their water tested for mining-related substances. Well owners along Michel Creek, the Fording River, and the Elk River should be aware that concentrations of some mine-related substances may be elevated, especially when creeks and rivers have low flow. Teck shares the laboratory results with well owners and regulatory agencies, but they are otherwise confidential. The laboratory results are compared to the BC drinking water quality guidelines. If the results are above background levels but below the BC water quality guidelines, Teck will continue to sample the well annually or every three months, depending on the results. If the results are above guidelines for mine-related substances, Teck provides alternate drinking water and continues routine monitoring. In 2018, four of the thirteen wells that were sampled routinely as part of this program had concentrations of selenium temporarily above the BC drinking water guideline of 10 \u00b5g/L. Sparwood Area Groundwater Study Teck's monitoring program identified elevated concentrations of mine-related substances, primarily selenium, in groundwater in the Sparwood Area. Teck has been conducting a special groundwater study in the Sparwood area to identify the potential sources and pathways of mine-related substances in drinking water. In 2018, Teck reviewed all the domestic wells in the Sparwood Area and analyzed how groundwater could be affected by mining activities. The analysis confirmed that mine-influenced groundwater exists in some aquifers and suggested that the source of mine-related substances was likely from groundwater flowing through the Michel Creek valley bottom rather than directly from Baldy or Sparwood Ridge. Seven new wells were drilled in the Sparwood Area to address these gaps in our understanding of the groundwater flow paths.34 | 2019 Environmental Monitoring Committee Public Report | What We Learned From the Monitoring Programs in 2018Figure 18.

Routine field sampling occurs every year, and the results are analyzed and shared with the EMC as they are generated. A RAEMP report is developed every three years. The purpose of this program is to: assess the effects of mine operations, individually and toge ther, on aquatic ecosystems within the Elk River watershed monitor changes over time help understand whether Teck's management and mitigation actions are working as intended by the Elk Valley Water Quality Plan and Permit 107517 Teck completed the first comprehensive cycle of field sampling in 2015 and a subset of sampling in 2016 and 2017 in target areas. The first RAEMP report was submitted to the Director in September 2017. 5 In March 2018, Teck developed a new study plan for the 2018 to 2020 RAEMP cycle. Based on advice from the EMC, Teck added five new studies to better understand: lentic areas (locations with slower moving water) reproductive effects of selenium on the Columbia Spott ed Frog reproductive effects of selenium on the fish, Redside Shiner toxicity in sediment nutrient loading from mine-related sources and active water t reatment facilities Teck completed the second comprehensive cycle of sampling in 2018. This included benthic invertebrate sampling at 69 locations and fish sampling at 18 locations: 11 for Westslope Cutthroat Trout and 7 for Mountain Whitefish. The results from the routine sampling and the additional studies will be included in the RAEMP report submitted to the Director and the EMC in September 2020. 5Regional Aquatic Effects Monitoring Program 2015-2016 Report 37Benthic Invertebrates Benthic invertebrate communities in the flowing portions of the Elk River and its tributaries are dominated by mayflies (Ephemeroptera), stoneflies (Plecoptera), and caddisflies (Trichoptera). These three aquatic invertebrates are collectively called EPT. EPT are considered highly sensitive to changes in water quality and habitat disturbance. When EPT are abundant, it indicates good quality habitat for aquatic organisms. Of the 46 mine-exposed areas sampled in 2018, five had EPT abundances less than the normal range observed in reference (not mine-exposed) tributaries. Results from 2018 again showed a reduction in the proportion of three types of mayflies in the upper part of the Fording River. The extent and cause of this reduction cannot be explained by water quality or calcite effects alone and may be due to both mine-related and natural factors. Teck is continuing to investigate this under the Fording River Operations Local Aquatics Effects Monitoring Program (page 39). The selenium concentrations in the tissues of benthic invertebrates collected in fast-moving waters have typically been less than what is considered to have a 10% effect on benthic invertebrate reproduction (this is called the Level 1 benchmark). The preliminary results from 2017 and 2018 indicate that 8 out of 76 areas sampled (9.2%) had one sample or more with a selenium concentration greater than the Level 1 benchmark for benthic invertebrates. Accumulation in these areas was expected given the projected selenium concentrations for these areas in the EVWQP. The concentrations of selenium in benthic invertebrates from slow-moving water have frequently been greater than the Level 1 benchmark. You can find more information about the benchmarks, and how they were derived, in the Elk Valley Water Quality Plan (EVWQP). The tissue results were compared to normal ranges in reference tributaries and to water quality and bioaccumulation models that were developed for the EVWQP. In 2017 and 2018, tissue selenium concentrations measured in benthic invertebrates from 72.3% of the mine-exposed areas (47 of the 65 areas sampled) were above the upper end of the normal range of reference tributaries. The tissue selenium concentrations in benthic invertebrates were generally within the range predicted by the bioaccumulation model presented in the EVWQP in all study areas, except for Bodie Creek and Dry Creek near Line Creek Operations. Bodie Creek was receiving water pumped from mining pits that had forms of selenium more easily accumulated, which led to higher selenium concentrations in benthic invertebrates. In Dry Creek, tissue concentrations are uncharacteristically high and Teck is evaluating the different forms of selenium. The EMC will continue to review this information and provide input through the Dry Creek Local Aquatic Effects Monitoring Program. Figure 20. Mayfly (Ephemeroptera) Figure 22. Caddisfly (Trichoptera)Figure 21. Stonefly (Plecoptera)38 | 2019 Environmental Monitoring Committee Public Report | What We Learned From the Monitoring Programs in 2018Fish In the first cycle of the RAEMP (2015 to 2016), Teck studied three species of fish that are common in the Elk Valley: Westslope Cutthroat Trout, Mountain Whitefish, and Longnose Sucker. Westslope Cutthroat Trout are widely distributed throughout the Elk River watershed and are the only fish present in the Fording River upstream of Josephine Falls. Teck sampled fish from the Elk and Fording Rivers in 2015 and again in 2018. Samples were obtained by taking a very small amount of muscle, called a plug. Fish are then released. Preliminary results from the September 2018 sampling events indicate that nearly all of the fish sampled had selenium concentrations near or above the upper limit of the normal range observed in reference-area fish. These results are similar to those from 2015. However, these tissue concentrations were within the ranges projected by the bioaccumulation models developed for the EVWQP. All the fish collected from fast-moving water had selenium concentrations less than the Level 1 benchmark for reproductive effects, except for the fish from Line Creek. You can find more information on this topic on page 39). Teck also conducts an annual population study on Westslope Cutthroat Trout in the Fording River. This study is not a permit requirement, but the results are shared with the EMC. The 2017 results indicated that the population was stable and potentially increasing 6; however, preliminary results from September and October 2019 showed a very concerning decrease in juvenile and adult Westslope Cutthroat Trout density estimates compared to 2017. These findings are being evaluated under the adaptive management framework and Teck is involving all regulatory agencies. The EMC will be provided information on the evaluation. Mountain Whitefish are found mainly in the Elk River and in the lower reaches of the Fording River, Line Creek, Alexander Creek, and Michel Creek. Samples were collected in 2015 and 2018 and analyzed for selenium concentrations. Fifty-six mountain whitefish were euthanized in 2018 to obtain both muscle and ovary tissue samples. Eight locations were sampled, including two reference locations and six mine-influenced locations. The concentration of selenium in muscle tissue was higher than the BC water quality guideline for aquatic life for fish collected from the six mine-influenced locations. The concentration of selenium was below the guideline for fish collected from the reference locations. The concentration of selenium in the ovary tissue was higher than the guideline at both the reference and the mine-influenced locations. For fish collected at four of the six mine-influenced locations, the concentration of selenium in ovary tissue was above the interim screening value proposed by Teck (29.3 mg/kg dw). Teck and the EMC are discussing redoing the study to better understand the potential consequences of elevated selenium levels to Mountain Whitefish. Dwarf Longnose Suckers are found in slow-moving waters throughout the Elk Valley. Teck collected tissue samples from fish in 2015 (from six locations) and 2018 (from Goddard Marsh only) and analyzed them for selenium concentrations. More intensive sampling will be carried out in fall 2019. In the six mine-exposed areas sampled in 2015, the concentration of selenium was greater than for those fish collected from reference areas. The concentrations of selenium in ovary and muscle tissues were above the Level 1 benchmarks for reproductive effects for all individuals from Goddard Marsh, some of the fish from the Elk River wetland (downstream from Grave Creek), and some of the fish in Stanford Pond (near Fernie). The results from 2018 indicate that concentrations are increasing and Teck is discussing a selenium effects study on this species in the next few years. The results from 2019 will be shared with the EMC for their review and advice, and will be reported in the RAEMP 2020 report. 6Upper Fording RIver Westslope Cutthroat Trout Population Monitoring Project 2012 to 2017What is mg/kg dw? The abbreviation mg stands for milligrams, kg stands for kilogram, and dw stands for dry weight. So a selenium concentration of 11 mg/kg dw means there is 11 milligrams of selenium per kilogram of dry fish tissue. Figure 23. Westslope Cutthroat Trout39Local Monitoring Local aquatic effects monitoring programs are designed to answer specific questions about aquatic effects that arise because of the unique circumstances of a particular mine operation and that cannot be answered using only the regional aquatic effects monitoring program. Teck currently has five local aquatic effects monitoring programs underway. Fording River Operations The local aquatic effects monitoring program at the Fording River Operations began in 2016. The intent of this program is to document current conditions and evaluate the aquatic effects of mine development and the planned active water treatment facilities (two active water treatment facilities are required by Permit 107517). The first three years of monitoring results are required to understand aquatic conditions before treatment so changes could be measured as the treatment facilities come online. The Fording River South Active Water Treatment Facility is currently under construction; commissioning is planned for late 2020. This facility will treat water from Cataract Creek, Swift Creek, and Kilmarnock Creek. Results from the past three years showed a decrease in the abundance of mayflies in the upper Fording River at specific locations. The results from Teck's investigations do not point to a single direct cause. The decrease in abundance is likely due to a combination of both mine-related and natural factors (such as mine-related water quality concentrations of selenium, nitrate, and nickel; water temperature variability; annual flow variability; and predation by other organisms). Because sections of the upper Fording River flow underground at certain times of the year, the 2019 monitoring program will assess how benthic invertebrate communities re-establish after a drying event. The program will continue to address the key questions related to the effects from Fording River Operations and the active water treatment facilities as they are commissioned. Greenhills Operations The local aquatic effects monitoring program at Greenhills Operations began in 2017 to gain a better understanding of the side channel that lies between Greenhills Operations and the Elk River. This side channel receives flow from Thompson Creek, Wolfram Creek, Leask Creek, and Mickelson Creek.Results from 2017 and 2018 indicated that the side channel is used by a variety of fish and birds, from spring through fall when the side channel has flowing water. Seasonal drying of the side channel makes it poor habitat for amphibian breeding. Water quality in the side channel is influenced by Wolfram Creek and Thompson Creek, resulting in concentrations above the EVWQP Level 1 benchmarks (>10% effect size) for fish. Selenium concentrations in benthic invertebrates were higher in the side channel than in the mainstem of the Elk River, but the community endpoints did not differ greatly. In Thompson Creek and the downstream wetland, selenium concentrations in benthic invertebrates were above the EVWQP Level 2 benchmarks (> 20% effect size) for fish and birds. The study design for 2019 takes a more focused look at water quality in the west-side tributaries, the side channel, and the mainstem of the Elk River. It will also look at groundwater-surface water interactions in the side channel and will continue monitoring the benthic invertebrate community and tissue chemistry to support answering the outstanding key questions of the program. Line Creek Operations There are two local aquatic effects monitoring programs at Line Creek Operations. The first began in 2014 to understand the potential effects of the West Line Creek Active Water Treatment Facility on water quality and aquatic organisms. Teck built the facility to reduce the concentration of selenium and nitrate in Line Creek. This facility is required by Permit 107517 and is the first of its type in the Elk Valley. The facility was operational from July to October 2014. It was shut down because of performance issues until late 2015. Water quality monitoring results from 2016 and 2017 indicated that the facility was removing 95% of the total selenium and 90% of the nitrate from the water. However, biological monitoring results showed elevated concentrations of selenium in the tissues of aquatic organisms collected in Line Creek immediately downstream of the facility. An investigation determined that the treatment process was converting the remaining selenium in water to a form that is more easily accumulated by aquatic organisms. The facility was again shut down from March to August 2018 while Teck added an advanced oxidation process to the facility to address the selenium conversion.40 | 2019 Environmental Monitoring Committee Public Report | What We Learned From the Monitoring Programs in 2018The temporary shutdown of the treatment facility in 2018 did not result in changes to the kinds, proportions, or numbers of benthic invertebrates in Line Creek. As predicted, results from 2018 indicate that selenium concentrations in aquatic biota decreased when the active water treatment facility was recommissioned with the advanced oxidation process. Monitoring in 2019 will confirm these results. This program continues to monitor water quality and aquatic organisms downstream of the facility to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment facility. A second local aquatic effects monitoring program at the Line Creek Operations also began in 2014. This program was designed to determine the effects of the Line Creek Phase II project on the Dry Creek drainage by evaluating the potential effects of mine-related substances on aquatic biota. This program is required under a different permit (Permit 106970), but it was brought to the EMC for their review and advice early in 2019 through the adaptive management framework. The first three years of annual monitoring results (2014 to 2017) showed little change in the conditions of the three creeks within the Dry Creek drainage: Dry Creek, Grace Creek, and Unnamed Creek. In May 2017, the concentrations of nitrate, selenium, and sulphate increased. Nitrate concentrations were above the Level 1 benchmark for potential effects to aquatic biota, while the concentrations of selenium, sulphate, and cadmium were below this benchmark. Selenium concentrations in benthic invertebrates were similar in upper and lower Dry Creek and benthic invertebrate communities were not adversely affected. In 2018, results showed another increase in the concentrations of mine-related substances in Dry Creek and both the rate and magnitude of change was faster than what was projected by the Regional Water Quality Model. Another unexpected finding in 2018 was elevated concentrations of selenium in benthic invertebrate tissue samples collected in Dry Creek. These concentrations were 5 to 10 times greater than what was measured in 2017. Teck has been investigating these unexpected observations and has added four monitoring locations in the latter part of 2018 and increased monitoring frequency. Toxicity test results conducted in 2018 showed a low potential for direct effects to aquatic life. Despite the changes in water quality in Dry Creek, and the unexpected selenium concentrations in the benthic invertebrates, benthic invertebrate communities were similar between upper and lower Dry Creek in 2018. Elkview Operations There are currently no site-specific issues or questions at Elkview Operations that require a local aquatic effects monitoring program. If a specific issue or question arises that cannot be addressed by the regional program monitoring, Teck will work with the EMC to develop a local program. Coal Mountain Operations The first year of local aquatic effects monitoring at the Coal Mountain Operations was 2019. This monitoring program was required by Permit 107517 because of results coming out of the regional monitoring program, Coal Mountain Operations management plans, and the routine laboratory tests for toxicity (bioassays). This program also supports the closure plans for Coal Mountain Operations. Results from the regional monitoring program, Coal Mountain Operations management plans, indicated that the benthic invertebrate community in Corbin Creek downstream of the Coal Mountain Operations and in Michel Creek displayed reduced numbers of certain species when compared to the reference sites. Results from the routine bioassays showed that water from Michel Creek was having a negative effect on certain test species. Teck launched an investigation into these results and found that nickel may be the cause, even though concentrations were below the BC water quality guideline. See the Nickel section on page 27 for more information. The 2019 program will focus on water and sediment quality, calcite index, and benthic invertebrate tissue and community metrics. These results will help answer key questions about the magnitude and spatial extent of effects from the closure activities, such as pit pumping. 41Bioassay Studies Bioassays are laboratory tests that involve exposing certain organisms (such as very young fish, water fleas, amphibians) to water or sediment collected from a monitoring location, and observing growth, reproduction, and survival of individuals. Teck routinely tests waters from various creeks in the Elk Valley and from the Fording and Elk rivers. In 2018, Teck also undertook detailed laboratory tests to understand the sensitivities of invertebrates, amphibians, and fish to mine-related substances. Routine Laboratory Tests Short-term laboratory tests are conducted on water samples collected from a number of monitoring stations throughout the Elk Valley. These tests are part of Teck's routine water quality monitoring, which is conducted monthly (weekly during spring). The short-term laboratory tests use water fleas (a small 1 to 5 mm crustacean called Daphnia magna ) and very young Rainbow Trout. The water sample passes the test if 50% or more of the organisms survive exposure (tests last 96 hours for trout and 48 hours for the water flea). Failing the test triggers follow-up investigations that may include re-testing the water sample or additional studies to determine the cause of the failure. In 2018, 294 short-term tests with Rainbow Trout were conducted and all samples passed. A total of 305 water flea short-term tests were completed and four samples from Cataract Creek failed. Teck completed various follow-up studies and the results suggested that mineral precipitates (including calcite) were responsible for the failures. Long-term laboratory tests are conducted every three months on water samples collected from the eight compliance points. These tests use algae, amphipods, water fleas, Fathead Minnows, and very young Rainbow Trout. Long-term tests range in duration from 72 hours (for algae) to 30 days (for Fathead Minnow and Rainbow Trout). About one third of the 115 long-term tests conducted with mine-influenced waters showed inhibited growth or reproduction in one or more of these organisms compared to the growth and reproduction of organisms held in reference (non mine-influenced) river water (Figure 24). Long-term test results help Teck and the EMC understand the health of the Elk River and its tributaries. Nitrate and Sulphate Laboratory Tests When the EVWQP was developed, the limits for nitrate and sulphate in the water were set based on the available science, as well as provincial and federal benchmarks. There was some uncertainty at the time whether these limits were low enough to protect the most sensitive aquatic organisms. Teck began conducting laboratory tests to investigate the tolerances of aquatic invertebrates, fish, and amphibians to nitrate and sulphate (at the same time) under conditions similar to what is found in the Elk Valley. The results from those tests have confirmed that the benchmarks used to develop the limits are in fact protective of sensitive aquatic invertebrates and fish, with a margin of safety potentially greater than prescribed in the EVWQP.05101520253035Number of Tests By Species (total number of tests in 2018) Water flea (33)Alga (31)Amphopid (23)Rainbow Trout (15)Fathead Minnow (13) No adverse response Possible adverse response Likely adverse response14 2 172 1 288 1 142 1 124 9 Figure 24. Number of long-term laboratory tests by species in 2018.42 | 2019 Environmental Monitoring Committee Public Report | What We Learned From the Monitoring Programs in 2018The sensitivity of amphibians to nitrate and sulphate has not been well studied, and so their tolerances were unknown during the development of the EVWQP. Teck, therefore, started laboratory tests with frogs (Northern Leopard frogs) in 2016. Testing with frogs has been challenging. The tests require that the tadpoles be reared in the laboratory; a process that takes months. Studies in 2016 and 2017 produced unreliable results because of unexplainable mortalities in the control samples (lab water). The laboratory tests were repeated in 2018, this time with success. The 2018 results will be reported in 2019, but they generally support that the limits for nitrate and sulphate are low enough to protect amphibians as well as aquatic invertebrates and fish. Amphibian Egg-Viability Laboratory Tests Several species of amphibians live in the side channels of the Elk River and in its smaller tributaries. The sensitivities of amphibians to selenium has not been well studied. Teck conducted a preliminary study of selenium toxicity to Columbia Spotted Frog in 2012, but the EMC felt there remained a gap in understanding the risks of selenium exposure to the survival of larval Columbia Spotted Frog (and other amphibians) in the Elk Valley. In 2018, Teck collected fertilized egg masses of Columbia Spotted Frog from side-channels of the Elk River and reared them in the laboratory to evaluate the survival and deformity rates of eggs and tadpoles. The results showed no evidence of selenium effects on egg survival, or tadpole development, at egg selenium concentrations of up to 11 mg/kg dw. This work was repeated in 2019 to capture sites with a broader range of aqueous selenium concentrations as previous studies have observed concentrations upwards of 38 mg/kg dw. Figure 25. Columbia Spotted Frog egg mass within vegetation.Figure 26. Columbia Spotted Frog tadpoles in the laboratory. Fish Egg-Viability Laboratory Tests The limits for selenium in the EVWQP were based on previous studies in the Elk Valley and elsewhere. To provide more confidence in the benchmark for concentrations of selenium in ovaries, egg-viability studies became a requirement in Permit 107517. Teck completed an egg-viability study in 2015 using eggs collected from Westslope Cutthroat Trout. That study measured the concentration of selenium in eggs and evaluated their survival and development in the laboratory. The EMC considered the results and determined they were sufficient to confirm the critical selenium level in Westslope Cutthroat Trout ovaries. The EMC recommended the next egg-viability study should focus on Redside Shiners. Redside Shiners are small-bodied fish that are abundant in the Elk River watershed. Monitoring results from 2015 and 2016 show that this species accumulates greater amounts of selenium in its tissues compared to most other fish species and relative to tissue-based water quality guidelines in the Koocanusa Reservoir. The EMC recommended Redside Shiners for this study because little is known about the accumulation and toxicity of selenium in that species. Teck designed and implemented an egg-viability study on Redside Shiners in 2018. Redside shiners were successfully maintained in the laboratory, but the fish would not spawn. The study continued in 2019, where Teck collected eggs of Redside Shiner, fertilized them in the field, and brought them back to the lab. Results showed no effect of selenium, at the tested concentrations, on survival, growth, or deformities for this species. 43Koocanusa Reservoir The Koocanusa Reservoir straddles the border between Canada and the United States, and lies within the traditional territory of the Ktunaxa people. Three Canadian rivers supply most of the inflow to the reservoir: the Kootenay River (62%), the Elk River (26%), and the Bull River (11%). Since 2014 Teck has conducted studies to understand the physical, chemical, and biological conditions in the Canadian portion of Koocanusa Reservoir. This program is designed to determine if conditions in the reservoir are changing and if those changes can be attributed to influences from the Elk River and upstream mining activities. Teck collects samples upstream and downstream of the Elk River confluence, and compares the results to identify potential mining-related effects. The results of this monitoring program are summarized in reports that Teck submitted to the Director: the 2014 to 2016 monitoring cycle7 (submitted in June 2017) 2017 water quality conditions8 (submitted in June 2018) year one of the 2018 to 2020 monitoring cycle9 (submitted in June 2019) Currently, Teck is continuing year two of the 2018 to 2020 monitoring cycle, collecting information on water (physical and chemical), sediment (physical and chemical), phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, and fish. 7 Koocanusa Reservoir Monitoring Report, 2014 to 2016 (June 2017; updated June 2019) 8 Permit 107517 2017 Summary Report of Monitoring Results in the Koocanusa Reservoir (June 2018) 9 Koocanusa Reservoir Monitoring Program Annual Report, 2018 (June 2019)Water Quality Based on the results from 2014 to 2018, water quality in the Koocanusa Reservoir is generally good with minor exceptions. Concentrations of nitrate and selenium tended to be higher in areas downstream from where the Elk River flows into the reservoir (the confluence) compared to areas upstream of the confluence (when considering the annual average surface water quality). However, permit limits and BC water quality guidelines for nitrate, selenium, sulphate, and cadmium were met consistently at the order station in the Koocanusa Reservoir, except for selenium in April 2018. In April and May 2018, the riverine condition of the reservoir prevented field samplers from accessing the usual permitted sampling location safely. The April samples were therefore collected along the eastern shoreline. In May 2018, water samples were collected from both the eastern and western shorelines. The differences in the concentration of water quality parameters (selenium, for example) between the shorelines suggested that the water at this sampling location was not fully mixed. Follow-up studies by Teck (from April to August 2018) have offered insight into how water from the Elk River and the Kootenay Rivers behave in the reservoir. When water levels in the reservoir are low and the reservoir is river-like, the Elk River does not substantially mix with water from the Kootenay River until 4 or 5 kilometres downstream of the permitted sample location. At higher water levels (June through August and beyond), substantial mixing did not occur until 15 kilometres downstream of the permitted sample location. Figure 27.

Teck's sampling locations in the Koocanusa Reservoir.45Sediment Quality Sediment results from 2014 to 2018 showed that concentrations of most metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 10 were higher in sediments collected downstream of the Elk River confluence, but these concentrations were all below the BC sediment severe-effects guidelines. Certain metals, including arsenic, nickel, iron, and manganese were above the BC sediment low-effects guidelines both upstream and downstream of the Elk River. Aquatic Algae and Invertebrates Samples of phytoplankton (tiny suspended algae) and zooplankton (tiny suspended invertebrates) were collected in Koocanusa Reservoir upstream and downstream of the Elk River confluence in 2015, 2016, and 2018. The numbers and kinds of organisms present (community structure) were evaluated, as well as the concentration of selenium in zooplankton. The results showed no significant differences between the upstream and downstream locations.Clams, insect larvae, worms, seed shrimp, and mites were among the organisms found in reservoir sediments. These types of organisms are typical of reservoir habitat (deep and slow moving). There were minor differences in the kinds of organisms found in sediments downstream of the Elk River confluence compared to upstream, with natural variations in sediment texture likely to be the cause of those biological variations. Fish Teck collected samples of several different fish species in Koocanusa Reservoir from 2014 to 2018, including Peamouth Chub, Northern Pikeminnow, Largescale Sucker, Redside Shiner, and Yellow Perch. These samples provided important information on fish age, condition (weight in relation to length), liver size, gonad size, and growth. In addition to these fish health and population measurements, the concentration of selenium was measured in the muscle tissue, whole body tissues, and ovaries (Figure 30 and 31). 10 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are organic compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen. They occur naturally and are released from burning fossil fuels, trash, tobacco, and wood.Figure 29. Redside Shiner 46 | 2019 Environmental Monitoring Committee Public Report | What We Learned From the Monitoring Programs in 2018Teck conducted fish health surveys of Peamouth Chub and Redside Shiner in Koocanusa Reservoir that focused on fish survival (mean age), growth (body size-at-age), reproduction (relative gonad weight) and energy storage (relative liver weight and overall condition). The results from these surveys showed no consistent patterns among fish species, sexes, or sampling years that would indicate an influence from the Elk River (Table 1). Selenium concentrations measured in fish tissues from Koocanusa Reservoir were compared to guidelines published by the USEPA 11 and the British Columbia Ministry of Environment. They were also compared to the benchmarks established in the EVWQP. Selenium guidelines for fish tissues are estimates above which there is a potential risk of reproductive impairment. Guidelines vary between agencies because each agency employs different methods for defining a protective threshold and the critical burden of selenium in fish tissue (causing reproductive effects) is an evolving field of study. It is agreed, however, that the concentration of selenium in ovaries is the most relevant measure for evaluating ecological effects because it is selenium in eggs that poses risk of reproductive effects in fish. The average concentrations of selenium in the ovaries of fish collected from the reservoir were frequently above the BC guideline of 11 mg/kg dw, particularly in Peamouth Chub, Northern all Redside Shiner and Northern Pikeminnow, the average selenium concentrations in the ovaries were below both the EVWQP Level 1 benchmark (18 mg/kg (15.1 mg/kg dw). Redside Shiner samples were above the Level 1 benchmark at both downstream and upstream locations (above mine-influenced waters) in the three years it was sampled (2015, 2016, and 2018).

The guidelines were published in 2016.47BCMOE Creek (US)McGillivray (US) Peamouth ChubSelenium Concentration (\u00b5g/g dw)Redside Shiners appear to have a greater body burden (greater accumulation) of selenium than most other species. The implications of these higher concentrations are currently unknown because no studies have been done to determine the toxicity of selenium on this species. Redside Shiners are highly abundant in the Elk Valley watershed, so the EMC has recommended a study to evaluate the effects of selenium on the early life stages of Redside Shiners (see page 42). Individual fish, including Peamouth Chub, Northern Pikeminnow, Longnose Sucker, and Rainbow Trout collected downstream of the Elk River confluence had selenium concentrations above the Level 1 EVWQP benchmark for ovaries; however, only Northern Pikeminnow showed average selenium concentrations in their ovaries above the Level 1 benchmark. When a selenium guideline or benchmark is exceeded, it does not necessarily mean that there will be an effect to the organism. Fish species have a range of sensitivities to selenium in their ovaries, and critical levels have not been established for all the species that have been reported in the Koocanusa Reservoir. Ongoing and future studies will be evaluating the sensitivity of species that exhibit elevated selenium in their tissues to better understand whether effects are expected. Figure 30.

A human health risk assessment determines the potential risks to human health posed by the presence of certain substances within a defined area. It considers the toxicity of the substances, how much of the substances humans are exposed to, and how often. A human health risk assessment is not a monitoring program, but rather a snapshot in time that relies on the most recent monitoring results from other programs. Teck submitted a Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) report to the EMC and the Director in March 2016. After reviewing that report, two EMC member organizations (IHA and KNC) felt the potential health risks to Ktunaxa citizens\u2014based on their preferred consumption rates of wild foods\u2014were not addressed. To address these concerns, Teck evaluated the risks associated with consuming wild foods at the preferred rates defined in the Ktunaxa First Nation Diet Study (Firelight 2015). Teck described the results of their evaluations in a technical memo and submitted it to the EMC and the Director in September 2016. Following the review of that technical memo, the EMC acknowledged that there were information gaps in what was known about current and preferred consumption rates. In addition, IHA and KNC felt that two separate documents would be a source of confusion and misunderstanding among community members, decision- makers, and other readers, and felt the 2016 HHRA should be reissued. KNC also had outstanding concerns with the portrayal of the preferred consumption rates in the follow up evaluation. IHA and the KNC, with support from the First Nation Health Authority, reached out to the Director and the Ministry of Health to express their concerns and to resolve the stalemate over the 2016 HHRA. The Director has formally acknowledged that Teck submitted the HHRA report by the permit deadline, but the report has not yet been approved or rejected. The Director is expecting that Teck work with KNC and IHA to resolve the information gaps and submit an updated HHRA that includes a complete analysis of both current and preferred consumption rates in one report due later in 2020. The KNC is working on an updated preferred consumption rate study which will inform the 2020 HHRA. And Teck, KNC, and IHA are working together to define the objectives and scope for an updated human health risk assessment, meeting every month for targeted discussions to ensure progress on this important file. Teck and the KNC are continuing with the wild foods sampling program to provide additional information for the assessment. What are wild foods and what is the Wild Foods Sampling Program? Wild foods are plants or animals harvested from the land and water that humans eat or use for teas and medicine. Some examples are rose hips, huckleberries, fish, elk, and deer. Teck accepts donations of small samples (about \u00bd cup) of wild foods harvested from the Elk Valley. Teck sends the samples to a laboratory to measure the concentration of mine-related substances. The results from the wild foods sampling program are used in all human health risk assessments in the Elk Valley. If you are interested in learning more about the program and possibly donating a sample or two, you can email samples.teckcoal@teck.com . Is the water safe to drink? The Interior Health Authority recommends that people do not drink surface water (from rivers, streams, or lakes) anywhere in the province. Surface water can contain microbiological contaminants (bacteria, viruses, and parasites) and industry-related substances. In the Elk Valley, industry-related substances are largely mine-related. Untreated surface water should be boiled to address microbiological contaminants, but this will not address risks associated with mine-related substances. In the Elk Valley, the surface water at many locations has selenium concentrations above the BC drinking water guideline of 10 \u00b5g/L (see map on page 51). Some of these locations see these levels only during winter months, but some locations (such as tributaries close to mine operations) see these levels year round. Short-term exposure (skin contact or ingestion) from time to time is not a health risk; however, long-term frequent exposure increases the health risk. See page 20. Drinking water systems in the Elk Valley depend on groundwater wells, not surface water. The selenium levels in tested drinking water wells are generally below 10 \u00b5g/L, with the exception of four private wells. We encourage private well owners in the Elk Valley to contact Teck to have months with a selenium monthly average above 10 \u00b5g/L One or more months with a selenium monthly average above 10 \u00b5g/LSurface Water Selenium Concentrations From May to October 2018 Compared to the BC Drinking Water Guideline (10 \u00b5g/L) Document Path: \\\\teckcominco\\CGO\\Groups\\TCGIS\\Data\\Projects\\AnnualWaterReporting\\Map\\SeSwimming.mxd10 0 10 5 Km\u00b152 | 2019 Environmental Monitoring Committee Public Report | Other ProgramsTributary Management Tributaries are smaller streams that flow into a larger stream or river (which are sometimes referred to as a mainstem) or a lake. Tributaries provide vital habitat for a variety of aquatic life and are important for the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem. Mining activities have the potential to affect the quality of water and habitat in tributaries, and in some cases the removal of tributary habitat was permitted to allow for mining of coal resources. Permit 107517 requires Teck to complete a tributary evaluation and to develop a tributary management plan with advice from the EMC. Permit 107517 states: The Tributary Management Plan is intended to incorporate protection and rehabilitation goals for tributaries that will support achieving the area-base objectives of the EVWQP. In development of the Tributary Management Plan, those tributaries that are not impacted by mining activities, that provide relatively high habitat value, and/or support ongoing habitat use by fish and sensitive aquatic-dependent wildlife (i.e., directly or indirectly through food production) shall be identified as the highest priority tributaries for permanent protection. Those tributaries that have been impacted by mining, provide or have the potential to provide relatively high habitat values, and/or support or could support habitat use by fish and sensitive aquatic dependent wildlife shall be identified as the highest priority tributaries for restoration or rehabilitation. The tributary management plan must be updated each year. Teck has been developing the Tributary Management Plan with the EMC since 2016, and submitted the first plan in 2017. This plan was accepted by the Director in February 2018 with conditions for the 2018 plan. EMC discussion and advice on the 2018 plan reflects differing perspectives on this plan.This plan will guide Teck's environmental management of tributaries and Teck will refer to this plan during mine planning. The overall goal of the Tributary Management Plan is to Protect and rehabilitate tributaries of the Elk River watershed on a priority and feasibility basis to benefit fish, aquatic-dependent wildlife, and vegetation, recognizing biological, social, and economic values, and Ktunaxa worldview. All the tributaries upstream of Sparwood that flow into the Fording River, Michel Creek, and the Elk River\u2014and that are currently mine-influenced 12 or could be influenced by Teck's future development plans\u2014are included in the management plan13. The mainstem of the Fording River, Michel Creek, and the Elk River are not considered to be tributaries and are managed according to the EVWQP and Permit 107517. Tributaries that have been permanently removed or severely altered by mining activities are also not included, consistent with Permit 107517 which states these are out of scope. In developing the Tributary Management Plan, Teck and the EMC undertook two important activities: tributary evaluation and tributary prioritization.What is an aquatic ecosystem? An aquatic ecosystem is all living things that depend on each other and their environment for food and shelter. This includes bacteria, fungi, insects, snails, and tiny free-floating plants and animals called plankton. There are also large plants\u2014like cattails and reeds\u2014plus fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds. 12 Mine-influenced means that the mine footprint extends into a tributary's catchment, so the tributary receives water that has been changed from being in contact with mine works. 13 The plan also includes two tributaries that flow from the area of Coal Mountain Phase 2 into the Elk River near Hosmer.5314Data Report for the Tributary Evaluation ProgramTributary Evaluation Teck assessed the ecological value of the tributaries of the Elk River and the Fording River and identified those tributaries that play a significant role in supporting the Elk Valley watershed as a whole. Teck worked with the EMC and the Elk Valley Fish and Fish Habitat Committee throughout this activity to make sure the evaluation results were supported by local knowledge. Teck submitted the results of this evaluation to the Director in June 2016.14 Tributary Prioritization Once the tributaries were evaluated, the next step for Teck was to determine which tributaries were a priority for protection, rehabilitation, or both. Teck developed a tool (with EMC advice) which generated prioritized lists of tributaries. The EMC participated in an exercise to consider the biological values of all the tributaries and brought forward considerations for interpreting the lists. Teck considered all the input from the tool and the EMC when it determined the final prioritized list. The EMC does not have consensus on all tributary priorities. Teck must update its Tributary Management Plan each year to include changes to its current and future mine development plans. The EMC reviews and discusses the draft versions of each annual update and all the supporting materials and information. Teck considers all the input the EMC provides before submitting the final version to the Director. The Director is currently reviewing and considering the 2018 Tributary Management Plan, which was submitted in February 2019. The EMC continues to discuss implementation and future refinements of the plan.54 | 2019 Environmental Monitoring Committee Public Report | Other ProgramsGlossary and Appendices 55Glossary active water treatment a method of removing substances from water that requires regular human intervention and management.

The northern portion of Ktunaxa amakis has historically been claimed by Canada, while the southern half is claimed by the United States. In Canada, the member communities of the Ktunaxa Nation include, akink'umasnuqiit (Tobacco Plains Band), aqam (formerly known as St. Mary's Band), yaqan nukiy (Lower Kootenay Band), and akisq'nuk (Columbia Lake Band). The Ktunaxa Nation maintains unceded Aboriginal title in much of what is now considered the East and West Kootenays. Ktunaxa communities south of the Canada-USA border are located in what is now Idaho and Montana. The Elk Valley, which is wholly within the unceded and unsurrendered territory of the Ktunaxa has been occupied continuously by the Ktunaxa Nation since time immemorial, and is maintained as Aboriginal title by the Ktunaxa Nation. The British Columbia (BC) portion of the traditional territory is subject to ongoing treaty negotiations with the Province of BC and the Government of Canada. The Elk Valley was traditionally used and occupied by the Ktunaxa Nation. Important Ktunaxa settlements were maintained in the Elk Valley well into the 20th century, and Ktunaxa citizens continue to reside throughout the lower Elk Valley, including in Sparwood, Fernie, and elsewhere. Ktunaxa oral histories, supported by historic archival and ethnographic data, suggest that Ktunaxa presence in the Elk Valley has long been centred on an important habitation area named k aqawakanmituk , a Ktunaxa settlement at the confluence of Michel Creek and the Elk River near present-day Sparwood. This is a very important cultural area in the Elk Valley. It was occupied annually, and likely for a long period of time up to the late 1800's, by the Michel Prairie people, also referred to as the Fernie Band, or k aqawakanmituknik . This was a historic Ktunaxa community with close ties to the current Ktunaxa community of Tobacco Plains whose annual round included hunting bison on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains. As described further below, many Michel Prairie people died as a result of early smallpox epidemics, likely in the late 1700s.The settlement of k aqawakanmituk at Michel Prairie included important tobacco cultivation areas, as well as habitation areas, processing areas, and other features including trails that connected the valley to mountain passes to the east. While there are no reserve lands in the Elk Valley, the Ktunaxa understand that reserve areas were promised in the area of Michel Flats and present day Sparwood, but were never formally allotted. The Elk Valley itself falls within the Ktunaxa traditional land district of qukinamakis . Qukin amakis is translated as Raven's Territory, Raven's Land or the Land of Raven. It is also sometimes used as a synonym for the Elk Valley because the valley and its surrounding mountains make up the majority of the lands associated with Raven. Today, the Elk Valley is known to Ktunaxa peoples not only for the richness of its fish and game but also for the presence of coal and extensive coal mining, and the associated restrictions on access to mining lands, many of which are private. For the Ktunaxa Nation, the history of coal mining in the Elk Valley, including recent history, has been a story of exclusion with more than a century of efforts by non-Ktunaxa individuals and companies to extract qukin nukiy (Raven's Rock, or Coal) from qukinamakis (Raven's Land). Available information (archival and ethnographic), as well as oral histories and archaeology, supports an understanding that the Elk Valley in general, and specifically the upper Elk River, including areas around Michel Creek, Line Creek, Grave Creek, Round Prairie, and the Fording River, has been continuously used and occupied by Ktunaxa peoples, and specifically Upper Ktunaxa peoples, for hundreds of years prior to 1846. Water is fundamental to the Ktunaxa creation story, and is understood by Ktunaxa knowledge holders to be the basis for all living things within Ktunaxa amakis. Rivers, streams, lakes, and riparian areas provide essential habitat for the fish, and many of the animals and plants that Ktunaxa harvesters rely on, and responsible stewardship of water is a critical component of Ktunaxa responsibility. The Ktunaxa principle ofa'kxam is q apiqapsin is translated to mean a responsibility for stewardship of all living things. Within the borders claimed by Canada and British Columbia, the amakis of the Ktunaxa Nation covers approximately 70,000 km2 (27,000 square miles) of mountains, valleys, rivers and lakes in the Kootenay region. The region's landscape is alive with Ktunaxa culture and history. The Ktunaxa creation story relates the origins of the Ktunaxa people and describes the events and relationships that helped shape\u2014and continue to shape\u2014 Ktunaxa amakis . The geography of the Elk Valley is formed in the final events of the story, when the animal chief and creation hero, Namuqin , collapses, forming the Rocky Mountains with his body. 58 | 2019 Environmental Monitoring Committee Public ReportKtunaxa Law Ktunaxa law ( aknumu\u00a2tii ) and oral history (aqaq'anuxwati ) are both sacred and legal in nature. Ktunaxa land use rights are based on a sacred covenant with the Creator, whereby, in exchange for the land providing the Ktunaxa with the necessities of life, the Ktunaxa are responsible as stewards of the lands and resources in Ktunaxa amakis. The Ktunaxa have terms that address the natural world and how people are a part of it. akuk'pukam speaks to anything that gets life from the earth through roots. akuk'pukamnam adds the human dimension, whereby the earth's life is translated into human life. That is, the Ktunaxa have roots that tie them to Ktunaxa amakis , and they are of the earth. In other words, they believe that what they do to the earth, they do to themselves and to future generations. The Ktunaxa phrase that captures interconnectedness and the stewardship concepts applicable to land management is YaqaHankatiikinaamak . This phrase translates to \"our people care for the land, the land cares for our people.\" More information on the Ktunaxa laws and principles can be found in Section C for the Baldy Ridge Expansion project found on the Environmental Assessment Office website (https://projects.eao.gov.bc.ca/p/baldy-ridge-extension/docs ). 59Ktunaxa Creation Story In ancestral times referred to by the Ktunaxa as the animal world, there were references made many times by the Creator to when there will be aqmaknik (people). At that time, there was some disturbance caused by a huge sea monster known as Yawunik, who killed many of the animals. A council was called by the Chief animal, Namuqin. Namuqin was huge. He was so tall that he had to crawl on his hands and knees, for if he stood up his head would hit the ceiling of the sky. It was decided that Yawunik had to be destroyed. A war party was formed. Yawunik plied the Kootenay and Columbia River System including Columbia Lake and Arrow Lakes. Yawunik was sighted in the Columbia Lake near Yaqa\u00b7n Nukiy and the chase was on. At that time, the Kootenay River and the Columbia Lake were joined. As the chase proceeded, Namuqin gave names to many locations along the Kootenay River, Kootenay Lake, Arrow Lakes and the Columbia River. Yawunik was pursued down the Kootenay River past the Wasa sloughs, now called Wasa, BC. Skinku got into trouble here when he fell into the river and had to be rescued by Wasa, (horse-tail). The chase went by where the St. Marys River empties into the Kootenay River. aqam, where the St. Marys Reserve is now located, then on down river to Kankak (spring) where Mayuk (weasel) joined the war party. There were animals on both sides of the river as the chase continued, and among the party was a parasite, a\u00b7kukakuwum, who had to be carried on the backs of other animals. His name was umtus and he was mean and bossy. The other animals grew tired of his nagging and dumped him into the river at a place now known as Yaqaki watmitquiki umtus. Leaving the land of the Eagle, a\u00b7knuquamamakis and into the land of the woodtick, amna Amakis, past Wasaki (Waldo) then on past the now 49th Parrallel and then past Kaxax (Turtle), now underwater, near Rexford, Montana. The chase went on by a\u00b7kiyi (jennings) and on by aqswaq (libby) then into Skinku Amakis (the land of Coyote), past aqanqmi (Bonners Ferry, Idaho) then northerly past the now international boundary into apu amakis, the land of the Wolverine, past Yaqa\u00b7n Nukiy BC) then up the Kootenay Lake past aqasqnuk, (Kuskannok, BC). The chase went on by Akuqi (Akokli Creek), past Ksanka Creek. The Yawunik chose to follow the Kootenay River past aqyamup (Nelson, BC). The chase was now in Miqaqas amakis (the land of Chickadee). At Kiksiuk, (Castlegar, BC) Yawunik went north into the Arrow Lakes, past akinkanuk (Arrow Rock) where arrows were shot into a crevice in the rock. If the arrow was true, the journey continued, if the mark was missed, beware, danger ahead. The arrow was true and the journey continued past anunik (Nakusp) then up past Ktunwakanmituk Miqaqas (Revelstoke, BC) where the Columbia River flows into the Arrow Lakes, then up and around The Big Bend then down past aknuquk (Golden, BC) past Yaknusuki (Briscoe, BC) then on past Yakyuki. The chase carries on through Kwataqnuk (Athalmere) then past Kananuk (Windermere, BC) past akiskqnuk (Windermere Lakes), then back into the Columbia Lake, Yaqa\u00b7n Nukiy, (Canal Flats, BC). This completed the cycle of the chase. Yawunik would once again escape into the Kootenay River and the chase would go on. The chase would go on and on. Every time the war party thought they had Yawunik cornered, Yawunik would escape again. One day sitting on the river bank observing the chase was a wise old one named Kikum. Kikum told Namuqin, You are wasting your time and energy chasing the monster. Why not use your size and strength and with one sweep of your arm, block the river from flowing into the lake and the next time the monster enters the lake you will have him trapped. Namuqin took the advice of Kikum and did as he was told. The next time Yawunik entered the lake, he was trapped. Having successfully corralled Yawunik, a decision had to be made as to whom the honor of killing Yawunik would be bestowed upon. The honor was awarded to Yamakpa (Red-headed Woodpecker). 60 | 2019 Environmental Monitoring Committee Public ReportWhen Yawunik was killed, he was taken ashore and butchered and distributed among the animals. There remained only the innards and bones. The ribs were scattered throughout the region and now form the Hoo Doos seen throughout the area. Nalmuqin then took the white balloon-like organ, known as the swim bladder, and crumbled it into small pieces and scattered it in all directions saying, These will be the white race of people . He then took the black ingredient from the inner side of the backbone, the kidney, and broke it into small pieces and scattered them in all directions declaring, These will be the black race . He then took the orange roe and threw the pieces in all directions saying, These will be the yellow race of people . Namuqin looked at his bloody hands and reached down for some grass to wipe his hands. He then let the blood fall to the ground saying, This will be the red people, they will remain here forever . Namuqin, in all the excitement, rose to his feet and stood upright hitting his head on the ceiling of the sky. He knocked himself dead. His feet went northward and is today know as Ya\u00b7iki, in the Yellowhead Pass vicinity. His head is near Yellowstone Park in the State of Montana. His body forms the Rocky Mountains. The people were now keepers of the land. The spirit animals ascended above and are the guiding spirits of the people.

Feedback Loop BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 1 1.0 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background The following draft Aquatics Monitoring Plan (AMP ) has been developed for the Grassy Mountain Coal Project (the Project) with the objective of verify ing predicted potential effects to the downstream aquatic environment and to westslo pe cutthroat trout (WSCT ) as identified in the surface water quality assessment ( Consultant Report [CR] #5, CIAR #42) and the fisheries ( Addendum 1, CR #6, CIAR #44). The various aspects of the monitoring plan are developed to verify the predictions of environmental effects made during the EIA and to confirm whether mitigation measures have achieved the desired outcomes. T his AMP is essential for identifying whether the proposed mitigation s or monitoring methodologies need to be modified or adapted as the Project proceeds in order to continue to be effective and to address previously unanticipated adverse environmental effects. 1.2 Purpose The EI A process identified water quality and WSCT as important aquatic ecology valued components (VC) . Residual effect s were predicted, which require monitoring to confirm the performance of mitigation applied to remove or counterbalance any predicted effects on these valued aquatic ecology VCs. The effectiveness of the mitigation measures and determination of significance will be confirmed though the AMP . The AMP was developed based on regulatory requirements associated with federal and provincial legislation including the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) and Fisheries Act as well as the provincial Wildlife Act. T he various programs within the AMP, such as groundwater monitoring, hydrology monitoring, or calcite monitoring , were also based on best management practices and the current scientific literature. The purpose of the AMP is to test predictions of the EIA regarding potential Pro ject effects on stream flows, water quality, sediment quality , and fish and fish habitat during operations, closure and early post- closure phases. T he AMP integrate s the monitoring of various aquatic resource components into a single document, thereby providing a single instrument for regulatory review of aquatic effects and reducing costs of sampling, administration and reporting. 1.3 Context This preliminary draft AMP has been prepared using the most current information available regarding mitigation, monitoring, and potential adaptive management options related to the Project. F inalization of the AMP will occur shortly after Project ap proval; however, Benga recognizes for the purposes of the regulatory approval process regulators require a sufficient amount of information regarding the AMP to reduce uncertainty as part of a final decision process . The intent of this preliminary draft is to provide the foundations of the Project's AMP, with recognition that an agreement on sampling locations, parameters, and reporting frequency with provincial and federal regulators will be required, BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 2 as well as additional logistics , which will be developed in the detailed design phase such as standard operating procedures, and alignment with pending construction and operations schedules. 2.0 REGULAT ORY STATUES, APPROVALS AND GUIDELINES The following Acts , guidelines , and recovery strategies were used to shape this AMP: Fisheries Act , including the anticipated Coal Mining Effluent Regulation; Species at Risk Act (SARA); WSCT Recovery Strategy (DFO 2014), including population distribution objectives; Draft WSCT Recovery Strategy (DFO 2019); Precautionary Pr inciples ; and Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (EPEA). The final version of the AMP will list all the pertinent provincial and federal approval conditions relevant to AMP and will provide a concordance of how they are addressed in the Plan. 3.0 INDIGENOUS CONSULTATION Indigenous consultation to date has focused on identifying traditional knowledge and VCs related to fisheries, aquatic environment and water itself. T his has been used as input into the EIS and the development of the Project. Going forward, Benga has committed to developing an Indigenous monitoring program in cooperation with Indigenous groups to work in parallel with other western science-based monitoring programs. In addition, Benga will consult with Indigenous groups in developing the final AMP through a series of workshops. Benga has committed to providing Annual Reporting documents to Indigenous groups highlighting the results from the AMP and seeking any input that would help Benga improve monitoring and the effectiveness of mitigation measures. 4.0 POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF THE PROJECT T HAT REQUIRE MITIGATION The EI A (Addendum 1, Aquatic Ecology Effects Assessment, CR #6, CIAR #44) identified that WSCT population trends could be potentially influenced by the Project through Project footprint interactions, changes in water resources (groundwater and surface water), fluvial geomorphology (fish habitat), food supply (drift invertebrates), and water quality. A fter the application of mitigation, t he aquatic effects assessment predicted two Project residual effects, which will be counterbalanced through the Fisheries Offsetting Plan . They consisted of c hanges to tributary and mainstem aquatic and/or riparian habitat resulting from the Project foo tprint, and changes to hydrology in Gold and Blairmore creeks potentially affecting WSCT habitat. An overview of the potential Project effects to WSCT and their linkages to the components of this AMP is provided in Figure 4.0-1.

B enga has already committed to these mitigation measures and expects that they will become part of the anticipated EPEA approval for the Project. Table 5.0-1 summarizes the potential effects of the Project that require mitigation, the mitigation objectives, the proposed mitigations measures, how the Project will implement the proposed technical or economically feasible mitigation measures, and how Benga will ensure effectiven ess of the mitigation s.

Liaison with mine planners during the environmental impact assessment phase helps identify environme ntal constraints that the engineering teams can be aware of so that technical and economic measures can be implemented into mine plans . This approach of 'mitigation through design' is proactive vs reactive to potential environmental impacts. The Project's Fisheries Offsetting Plan was developed to adhere with the goals and objectives of the DFO Fisheries Protection Provisions (FPP) of the Fisheries Act , the Species at Risk Act Permitting Policy ) and the WSCT Recovery Strategy, and will be revisited accordingly based on any pertinent regulatory updates .

Through proactive and strategic Mine Planning, the Project's footprint has been minimized to the extent possible through storing of waste rock in existing disturbed locations and making best use of existing facilities, including through backfilling mined - out pits to limit the volume of waste rock that may come into contact with surface watercourse. Through proactive and strategic Mine Planning, avoidance of dumping waste rock into valley bottoms has been implemented . A cascade will be constructed from the discharge point of the SBZ , which will promote CO 2 off-gassing and atmospheric equilibration and thereby reduce the volume of calcite precipitates . The water would then pass through a coarse gravel ditch line, before enteri ng into the SBZ holding pond where water would be allowed to further equilibrate and be monitored for specific water quality parameters . The Project has developed a calcite monitoring program presented in this AMP . The proposed calcite monitoring program was based on other regulatory approved industry calcite monitoring plans. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 9 6.0 MONITORING P LANS The purpose of the AMP is to test predictions of the EIA regarding potential Pro ject effects on stream flows, water quality, sediment quality ( i.e., calcite precipitat ion), and fish and fish habitat during operations, closure and early post- closure phases. T he AMP integrates the monitoring of various aquatic resource components into a single program, thereby providing a single instrument for regulatory review of aquatic effects and reducing costs of sampling, administration and reporting. The AMP involves the monitoring of aquatic components including: Water Quality ; Aquatic Effects ; Calcite; Groundwater - Surface Water Intera ction; Hydrology; Fluvial Geomorphology, Bioenergetics ; and WSCT Population. The monitoring approach for each of these components is provided in the following sections. 6.1 Water Quality Monitoring 6.1.1 Goals and Objectives The overall goal of this component is to characterize and evaluate effluent that will be released from the mine into the aquatic receiving environment of Blairmore Creek , Gold Creek, and the Crowsnest River. 6.1.2 Study Design 6.1.2.1 Baseline Characterization Establish ment of a baseline will incorporate the previously collected EIA related information and the AMP specific sampling period of record, which will start at the regulatory approval phase (approximately one year). Additional baseline data will continue to be c ollected after start of construction at upstream location and at reference locations. The purpose of the baseline data collection will be to further characterize the existing water quality environment in order to have a defensible data set to compare moni toring results for their effectiveness, and to support in the identification and analysis of stressor indicators and effects indicators. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 10 6.1.2.2 Water Quality Sampling Locations Samples will be collected from one or more reference areas and appropriately located exposure areas. For effluent characterization, samples would be collected at each final discharge point (FDP). F rom a long- term trend analysis perspective, samples would be collected from identified distinct effluent plumes, which will be determined during mine operations. In general, the potential sampling sites could include the following: Blairmore Creek : Reference Area: water frequented by fish that are not exposed to effluent and that has fish habitat that as far as practicable is most similar to that of the exposure areas. One or more sampling sites upstream of the proposed mine footprint. Exposure Area: aquatic receiving environment that is exposed to FDPs from the following water management infrastructure: West Sedimentation Pond; three discharge points associated with the Saturated Backfill Zone Polishing Pond; and Plant Site Sedimentation Pond. Crowsnest River: Reference Area: Upstream of the confluence with Blairmore Creek . Exposure Area: Downstream of the confluence with Blairmore Creek; and Downstream of the confluence with Gold Creek. Gold Creek: Reference Area: water frequented by fish that are not exposed to effluent and that has fish habitat that as far as practicable is most similar to that of the exposure area. One or more sites upstream of the proposed mine footprint on Gold Creek; and A location on Caudron Creek, a tributary to Gold Creek. Exposure Area: aquatic receiving environment that is exposed to FDPs from the following water management infrastructure: North East Sedimentation Pond; and East Sedimentation Pond. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 11 6.1.2.3 Sampling Frequency Water samples will be coll ected from each FDP once per calendar quarter. Once distinct effluent plumes are identified, water samples will be collected once per calendar quarter. 6.1.2.4 Water Quality Parameters Collected (grab) w ater quality samples will be analyzed for the following par ameters provided in Table 6.1-1. Table 6.1-1 Core L ist of Water Q uality Analytes to be Analyzed Physical Parameters Alkalinity Electrical conductivity Hardness pH Temperature Total Dissolved Solids Total Solids Nutrients Ammonia Nitrite Phosphorus Sulphate Total nitrate Organics Total organic carbon Dissolved organic carbonTotal and Dissolved Metals Aluminum Arsenic Calcium Cadmium Chromium Cobalt Copper Lead Iron Mercury Manganese Nickel Uranium Zinc Total selenium Collection of water quality data will help provide the necessary information to understand toxicity testing results, as well as help interpret the results from the biological monitoring studies , which is described further in the Aquatic Effects Monitoring section below (Section 6.2). 6.1.2.5 Water Quality Guidelines and Site -Specific Objectives The Project will adhere to the pertinent provincial and federal water quality guidelines (WQG) for both Blairmore Creek and Gold Creek . Exceptions to these guidelines are the Project's proposed sulphate and selenium site- specific water quality objectives (SSWQO) established for Blairmore Creek. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 12 6.1.2.6 Approach Triggers Approach triggers are used to assess monitoring data, to provide an early alert to potentially decreasing water quality c onditions. A s an example, these approach triggers (Figure 6.1-1) could be set below the values of final Project approval limits, as a proportion of the WQGs and SSWQOs ( e.g., 75%). T his is based on the rationale that above this level, any upward trend or variability in water quality could lead to an exceedance. S pecific trigger values will be finalized for each analyte as part of the final, approved version of the AMP. 6.1.2.7 Water Quality Guideline Exceedance WQG or SSWQO exceedance results in specified actions and identified adaptive management responses. The protection goal and level of scientific rigor inherent in the WQGs and SSWQO informs the specific actions or adaptive management in the event that they are exceeded; briefly the basis for WQGs and SSWQOs includes: WQGs are established by governments for various water protection purposes. Exceeding WQGs triggers investigation and implementation of solutions (where warranted) on an expedited timeline. W here a WQG is exceeded, the AMP's response would be to conduct a re- evaluation of the WQG and if appropriate, develop a science, and aquatic risk based SS WQO on an accelerated timeline (Figure 6.1 -2). SSWQOs represent guidelines that have undergone considerable refinement through site-specific analysis and testing or other rigorous scientific review, such as the site -specific objectives for selenium and su lphate proposed for Blairmore Creek . Exceeding SSWQOs triggers specific actions, and SSWQOs are not normally subject to a re -evaluation step (Figure 6.1-3). Although the Project focuses primarily on maintaining water quality conditions in watercourses potentially influenced by the mine and specifically involves water quality assessment, biological indicators are also used as verification to ensure that the WQGs (or SSWQO) are adequately protective . The assessment of biological indicators would be reported as part of the AMP, or more immediately if required by regulators following previous notification of a water quality trigger exceedance or meaningful change in a biological indicator. 6.2 Aquatic Effects Monitoring 6.2.1 Goals and Objectives The overall goal of this component is to evaluate the effects of effluent released from the mine on the aquatic receiving environment of Blairmore Creek/Crowsnest River and verify that contact water from the mine does not adversely influence Gold Creek. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 13 6.2.2 Study Design 6.2.2.1 Sampling Locations and Activities For Aquatic Effects, the components required to be monitored, frequency of sampling, and sample locations are outlined in Table 6.2-1. Table 6.2-1 Aquatic Effects Monitoring Locations and Activities Station Location(s) Monitoring Parameters Monitoring Frequency Description of Monitoring Activities Effluent from each discharge point Water Quality (effluent subset) Quarterly Effluent from each discharge point will be analyzed for the parameters listed in Table 6.1-1 . Sublethal Toxicity 2x a year Effluent from each discharge point will be analyzed for sublethal toxicity responses from rainbow trout, Ceriodaphnia dubia and Lemna minor . Test organisms/sampling frequency will change based on results from the first three years of testing. Acute Toxicity Monthly Effluent from each discharge point will be analyzed for acute toxicity to rainbow trout and Daphnia magna . Sampling frequency may be decreased based on testing results. Aquatic Effects monitoring at established water quality sample locations Water Quality Quarterly A larger set of water quality variables than is monitored from liquid effluent will be monitored at the established AMP sample locations four times annually. Sediment Quality Once every three years Sediment will be monitored for total organic carbon as well as particle size at all benthic invertebrate community monitoring stations. Benthic Algae Once every three years Benthic algae will be monitored for biomass and tissue chemistry. Benthic Invertebrate Community Once every three years Benthic invertebrate communities will be sampled and evaluated by investigating various endpoints (density, evenness, richness, and B ray-Curtis index) as well as tissue chemistry. Fish Health Once every three years Fish health will be sampled and evaluated by investigating various effect indicators (growth, reproduction, condition and survival). 6.2.2.2 Toxicity Testing of Effluent 6.2.2.2.1.1.1 Acute Toxicity Testing Effluent will be required to be non-acutely lethal to fish and inver tebrates. I n order to monitor compliance, acute toxicity testing will occur. E ffluent from each discharge point will be analyzed monthly for two different test species (rainbow trout and Daphnia magna) . Any sample resulting in an BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 14 acutely lethal response will trigger increase sampling frequency, with potential remedial measures to be taken. 6.2.2.2.1.1.2 Sublethal Toxicity Testing In addition to acute toxicity testing, effluent will also be tested for sublethal toxicity . Sublethal toxicity will be sampled for twice a nnually once the mine is discharging. S amples will be tested for effects on fish early life stage development, invertebrate reproduction as well as plant and algae toxicity. 6.2.2.3 Benthic Algae Benthic algae are an important component of benthic invertebrate h abitat because they provide food and shelter for invertebrates. T he biomass of benthic algae on hard substrates tends to increase with increasing levels of nutrients . As a result, benthic algae growing on rock (called epilithic algae) can be used as indi cators of nutrient enrichment. Primary producers also present an opportunity to measure selenium in the food web. A benthic algae survey will be included as part of th is aquatic effects sampling, which will be to determine whether there is enhanced algal growth in response to effluent exposure, as well as monitor selenium uptake in exposed areas. 6.2.2.4 Benthic Invertebrates Benthic invertebrate communities will be monitored in both the reference and exposure areas. The communities will be quantified as various endpoints. Endpoints include total benthic index . Each endpoint will be examined, and differences between the reference and exposure communities evaluated . Results of this evaluation will determine if benthic invertebrate communities significantly differ between the reference and exposure areas. Additionally, benthic invertebrates will be analyzed for tissue chemistry . Doing so will allow for additional monitoring of selenium uptake in exposed areas. 6.2.2.5 Fish Health A fish health study will monitor fish populations in receiving environments for signs that exposure to effluent may negatively impact fish health . This will include monitoring growth, reproduction, condition factor, and survival in both the reference and exposure areas. A key c onsideration when selecting a sentinel species is the mobility and residency time of that species relative to effluent exposure . Fish species that are resident in the aquatic system under investigation for most or all of their life cycle and exhibit territorial behavior or limited mobility/movement relative to the size of a study area are preferred because of the observed responses of these species are reflective of their localized environment. Species that are migratory or spend only a small proportion of their life cycle in the area under investigation are not suitable as sentinel species because exposure to effluent is minimal or transient. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 15 It is also best practice that preference be given to species of relatively small adult size since age -at-first maturity and adult natural mortality vary in proportion to adult size . This is because the adult abundance of small species should respond more rapidly to stressors that affect fecundity and/or larval survival. I n the case of the Project, the immediate stu dy area of Blairmore and Gold creeks do not contain any fish that would traditionally be considered appropriate as a sentinel species. B ased on this, Benga will consult with both DFO and ECCC to develop the final approach to monitor fish health in the receiving environment. 6.3 Calcite Monitoring The following c alcite monitoring approach is largely based on the calcite monitoring plan developed as part of the Elk Valley Water Quality Plan (Teck 2014). The ideas and methodology from the Teck (2014) plan were followed as it was developed by a team of experts with extensive collaboration from regulators . Teck has successfully implemented this calcite monitoring plan for five years, demonstrating the effectiveness of the study design. T he stratified approach ta ken also allows the methodology to be scaled to the size of system that requires monitoring. The intent of calcite monitoring is to document the extent of calcite deposition, the degree to which deposition has occurred, as well as to characterize the calcite depositions. T he following sections outline the general concepts for capturing this information . Detailed field methodology and procedures will be provided prior to the implementation of the calcite monitoring for the Project. 6.3.1 Goals and Objectives The goals of this program are to provide baseline information regarding naturally occurring calcite formations in the local study area (LSA) and to monitor calcite deposition in defined watercourses in the LSA . The implementation of the calcite monitoring will help the Project better understand effects to the receiving environment caused by upstream mine disturbance. T he objectives of this program will be to: characterize naturally occurring calcite formations in the LSA; monitor calcite formations in streams directly receiving mine waters as well as reference stream(s); document changes to the calcite formations (temporally and spatially); determine trends ( i.e., rates) of calcite deposition; present a standard methodology for data col lection and interpretation for calcite monitoring efforts; and inform any plans for calcite mitigation.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 16 6.3.2 Study Design 6.3.2.1 Stream Selection Site selection is an important factor when monitoring calcite in an aquatic system. I t will be important to capture site s/streams that will be directly impacted by receiving mine waters, as well as appropriate reference locations. T his section describes the selection process for the AMP. Project -Affected Streams Mine exposure is a key part of the stream selection process as mine influenced streams have increased potential for calcite deposition . As such, all reaches downstream of proposed mine discharges are included in the monitoring plan. A ll treated contact water will be discharged to Blairmore Creek , however, given the status of Gold Creek as designated critical habitat under the Species at Risk Act , the reaches of Gold Creek downstream of the mine are included in the study design . By monitoring Gold Creek for potential increased calcite deposition, uncertainty associated with surface water/groundwater interactions will be reduced. The mine influenced streams have been further differentiated into reaches . A complete breakdown of reaches will occur prior to any field sampling activities. Reference Streams Inclusion of reference streams allows the AMP to provide context for the extent, degree and trends of calcite formation occurring in mine -affected streams . Monitoring reference str eams will be of particular importance when examining long- term and large -scale spatial monitoring as they will provide information pertaining to natural environmental variability. Reference streams were selected from areas in the LSA that were consistent o ver the long term (i.e., not impacted by major development or anthropogenic disturbance) while also preferentially being located a sufficient distance from further mine development. A s the reference streams need to mimic conditions in the mine- affected st reams as closely as possible, parameters such as elevation, stream order, geology and channel morphology were also considered during the selection process. Reference streams were selected using the following process: characterization of exposure reaches b y stream order, bedrock geology, spatial distribution and channel morphology; review of reference sites from past studies in the area such as the baseline assessment (Addendum 1, CR #6, Appendix A1, CIAR #44), and select ion of appropriate locations using reach characteristics; and review additional locations to obtain reference streams that will adequately represent the spectrum of stream characteristics expected in the mine -affected streams. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 17 The above criteria revealed several possible locations for reference streams . Those most relevant to the monitoring objectives are upper Blairmore Creek and Caudron Creek (a tributary to Gold Creek). 6.3.2.2 Sample Timing and Frequency As the rate of change in calcite deposition is unknown for this system, annual sampling is recommended for the first three years of the plan . If after three years it is determined that sampling frequency is not adequate, it will be changed accordingly. Annual sampling for c alcite will be undertaken in the fall. This will ensure any eggs deposited in redds/spawning gravels will have had an appropriate amount of time to incubate, emerge, and allow fry to migrate to lower energy lateral habitats before spawning gravels are disturbed . Sampling will be completed whil e field crews are stationed at site sampling for other monitoring plans . This will ensure data captured is correlated with other sampling data while ensuring efficiencies in the Project are maximized. 6.3.2.3 Sampling Stratification Calcite is best assessed using a stratified approach . This approach is based on the hierarchy of spatial scales in stream networks. Using a spatial stratification approach allows for observations to be extrapolated over larger areas (Bisson et al. 2006). T he three scales at which sampling could occur and that have been considered are: catchment, reach, and habitat unit. Monitoring at the catchment scale for this study would not provide the spatial resolution required to inform and adequately trigger a mitigation response. Likewise, while monitoring at the habitat- unit scale would provide finer resolution, mitigation actions are not likely to be implemented at this scale . As such, monitoring at this scale would exceed the level of detail required for this monitoring plan. Consequently, stream reach is the recommended spatial scale to be adopted as the sampling unit for the calcite monitoring plan . A stream reach is a portion of a stream that is smaller than a catchment, but larger than a habitat unit. 6.3.2.4 Baseline Characteriza tion Reach Identification - Sampling Unit Reaches for streams to be monitored will be delineated using a desktop approach. M acrohabitat reach breaks w ill be delineated in Gold Creek and Blairmore Creek mainstems based on the criteria described in Lewis et al. (2004) classifying reaches as \"a homogeneous section of stream channel, characterized by uniform discharge, gradient, channel morphology, channel confinement, and streambed and bank materials.\" Detailed baseline habitat assessments completed in May an d October of 2016 identified reach breaks as: changes in stream gradient; changes in discharge, often where a significant tributary enters the mainstem; or identified barriers to fish movement. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 18 This approach for reach delineation aligns the AMPs calcite monitoring with all other Project disciplines allowing for a more coherent, thoughtful analysis of data collected. If during field studies, reach break observations differ from those defined during the desktop exercise, data collected in the field will be u sed to better refine the reach length . As such, reaches may evolve over the length of the monitoring plan. Within -Reach Replication - Sampling Sites Sampling sites will focus on locations within each reach that contain spawning gravels. A s this habitat is most sensitive to degradation resulting from calcite deposition, it will be important to monitor this specific type of habitat to better understand its susceptibility to calcite deposition in this system. In order to understand variability within the sampling unit (stream reach), replication is required . Following methodology from other calcite monitoring plans, triplicate sampling will be performed within each reach (Teck 2014). Locations containing appropriately sized spawning gravels nearest 25%, 50% and 75% of the total reach length will be sampled. All sampling units are anticipated to be over 300 m which will allow for triplicate sampling . As the plan evolves, reach lengths may change based on field observations . In the event changes to reach breaks occur, the following guidelines will dictate the number of samples collected per reach: Reaches <200 m - One sample collected over the entire length of the reach . Reaches <300 m -One sample collected at the downstream end of the reach and a second sample collected beginning at 100 m. C are will be taken to ensure sampling sites do not overlap. Reaches 300 m - Samples will be collected at 25 %, 50% and 75% of the total reach length. 6.3.2.5 Data Collection Capturing the Extent of Calcite Deposition The extent of calcite deposition will be measured in the field at each sampling site. T hese data will be used to extrapolate the linear coverage of calcite deposition over a reach. Site-Level Extent Calcite presence will be estimated by emplo ying a modified pebble count (Wolman 1954 and CABIN 2009). The pebble count procedure typically has a participant systematically moving through the stream while periodically stopping and randomly selecting a particle to measure . This methodology is traditionally used to garner information pertaining to substrate size and embeddedness but can easily be adapted to also capture information regarding calcite presence. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 19 The participant will randomly select a particle to be measured . All particles randomly selected will be included as datapoints, although only those larger than 2 mm will be measured . Particles smaller than 2 mm will be noted as fines but will not be measured . All measured particles will have their intermediate axis measured in mm, as well as a recording the presence (score = 1) or absence (score = 0) of calcite. Linear Extent/Gradient Desktop analysis will occur to estimate the extent of calcite deposition . The mean extent of calcite as a total percentage of spawning gravels available will be calculated . This will be done by the following formula: = 100 Linear g radients of calcite extent will also be presented over the multiple sites and reaches sampled. Capturing the Degree of Calcite Deposition Degree is used to describe the level of stream bed concretion . This will be estimated by level of effort required to remove the particle f rom the stream bed . Levels of concretion will be scored as follows: 0 - Not concreted (negligible resistance to remove particle) 1 - Partially concreted (resistance, but removable) 2 - Fully concreted (immovable) If the particle retrieved was too fine to visibly discern calcite presence/absence it will be assig ned a concretion score of 0. T his will be reported for each particle removed but will be specific to resistance created by calcite. Type of Calcite Depositions The type of calcite deposition will be recorded in addition to extent and degree. T ypes of calcite formations that can be visibly discerned in the field will include calcified algae, . Rate of Change After multiple years of data have been collected, it will be possible to examine the rate of change in extent and degree of calcite deposition. 6.3.2.6 Plan Assessment and Refinement The Calcite Biological monitoring approach will be refined as it progresses through the years. A s more detailed field data is captu red, the plan can become more refined and tailored to ensure site selection, field methodology and data analysis is functioning as intended. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 20 6.4 Groundwater -Surface Water Monitoring 6.4.1 Goals and Objectives The overall goal of this program is to evaluate the effects of Project activities on the survival and persistence of WSCT in Blairmore and Gold creeks, through fulfilling the following objectives: confirm surface water to groundwater fluxes; monitor and further evaluate groundwater- surfa ce water (GW/SW) interaction; and support the Project's fisheries offsetting approach . This monitoring component includes installation and monitoring of several well pairs adjacent to key reaches on Gold and Blairmore creeks to verify the GW/SW interaction. It is important to note that the groundwater monitoring included within the AMP is linked to the Project's overall groundwater monitoring program , which forms part of the Project's Water Management Plan (WMP) . The intent of the WMP is to implement me asures to capture, collect and treat surface and groundwater a t the source, and the WMPs groundwater monitoring program will have the primary objective to confirm the efficiency of the capture of contact water and the secondary objective to ensure that the receptors are not negatively impacted by the Project activities. The information presented in the AMP is the linkage to the secondary objective. 6.4.2 Study Design 6.4.2.1 Baseline Characterization The AMPs GW/SW monitoring network will comprise the installation of 12 well pairs, each comprising one shallow and one deeper monitoring well, adjacent to reaches of Blairmore and Gold creeks. T he well locations were chosen to allow for assessment and monitoring of vert ical gradients and fluxes within key reaches of both creeks, potential groundwater effects associated with key water management infrastructure features, and more detailed characterization within an ephemeral reach of Gold Creek . Monitoring well locations , rationale , monitoring parameters and frequency are summarized below. 6.4.2.2 Sampling Locations Several existing hydrometric monitoring stations are located along Blairmore and Gold creeks to monitor total streamflow . Data from these stations indicates anomalou s or inconsistent variations in the average annual unit runoff, losing reaches in both creeks where streamflows decline between downstream stations, and areas with subsurface flow . This suggests that the stations are located in areas with differing relati onships between surface water and groundwater. Groundwater monitoring well pairs are proposed within multiple reaches of both creeks to characterize local hydrogeologic properties, quantify vertical hydraulic gradients and inform fish habitat planning . BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 21 Five monitoring well pairs (A1 - A5) are proposed in four reaches of Blairmore Creek, and seven monitoring well pairs (B1 - B4, C1 - C3) are proposed in four reaches of Gold Creek. Sections of Gold Creek (most notably in Reach 6 as classified in Addendum 1, CR #6, Appendix A3 , CIAR #44) have also been found to be ephemeral, with surface water flows becoming subsurface or hyporheic throughout certain times of the year. S urface water flows within this reach also appear to be split between side channels and the coarse valley fill . Because Gold Creek sustains a population of WSCT there is an interest in maintaining surface flows within this mainstem stretch of the stream. Three monitoring well pairs (C1 - C3) are proposed in this reach at locations with differ ent proportions of surface flow and hyporheic or subsurface flow based on field observations or flow measurements upstream and along this particular reach . An upstream well pair is proposed around the GC-3 transect, where surface flow losses are common in all but freshet conditions . A downstream well pair is proposed around the Lille legacy coal pile area, where the Gold Creek channel has been observed to be dry multiple times . An intermediate well pair is proposed between these locations, where surface channel conditions are less known but may support greater channel flow given there are less braids in this area . The distance between these locations is approximately 1 km. T he location of these proposed wells is tabulated in Table 6.4-1. To support planning of potential stream modification the depth to groundwater, vertical hydraulic gradient, and thickness of unconsolidated deposits should be further explored. T he thickness of unconsolidated deposits here should be determined to provide estimates of the groundwater flux (i.e., verification of subsurface flow) in those deposits.

Top of well casing will also be surveyed to local hydrometric benchmarks and a regional datum. Subsequent monitoring will be undertaken at ever y well pair and include: Continuous groundwater levels and temperatures, using dataloggers. T emperature monitoring in the monitoring wells will supplement planned monitoring of stream temperature at adjacent hydrometric stations. D ifferences in groundwat er temperature fluctuations and stream temperature variations can be used to quantify groundwater contributions to streamflow at each location using analytical solutions. Quarterly monitoring of groundwater quality. 6.4.2.4 Continuous L evel Monitoring Monitoring wells should be outfitted with pressure transducers to continually monitor changes in water level, monitoring for changes in the vertical hydraulic gradient, and comparing pressure and temperature readings to the streams at adjacent hydrology st ations . Continuous level monitoring combined with hydraulic conductivity testing results will allow for point estimates of groundwater discharge/recharge. 6.5 Hydrology Monitoring Hydrology monitoring includes the continuous tracking and analysis of several hydrometric stations along key reaches of Gold and Blairmore creeks to confirm spatial and temporal variability of runoff across the Project, assist in evaluating groundwater -surface water interaction and support mitigation or BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 23 fisheries offset planning needs. The data may support monitoring and assessment of potential P roject effects related to the Project water management infrastructure features . Additional monitoring of flows and water levels at each feature is also likely to be required as part of EPEA or other permitting requirements, but these are outside the scope of the current document. 6.5.1 Goals and Objectives This monitoring program will assess predicted Project effects on surface flows and support in the tracking of fish and/or aquatic metrics dependent on flows and/or water levels such as water quality, fluvial geomorphology, and fish habitat . The plan will monitor the effectiveness of mitigation measures and inform adaptations of these measures as necessary based on monitoring results. T he goals and objectives of the hydrology monitoring are to: Measure changes to surface flows (and flow -dependent variables) resulting from the Project. Monitor hydrology, channel geomorphology and fish habitat related to the Project. As appropriate, consider and incorporate adaptations to mitigation measures should measurement indicate that Project targets are not being met. 6.5.2 Study Design 6.5.2.1 Baseline Characterization During the Project's baseline phase, the hydrological sampling was comprised of 10 streamf low stations on Gold and Blairmore creeks, one of which is operated by Water Survey of Canada (WSC) . The monitoring station ID's, locations, and rationale are summa rized in Table 6.5-1. E xcept for one new proposed station, the locations of all nine stations will remain installed as during the Project's baseline data collection . By maintaining this consistency, measured data can be directly compared to the assessments performed during the EIA to verify effect predictions. T he assessment nodes were selected to integrate potential Project effects on downstream watercourses and waterbodies, and comparison of these data with the upstream reference sites. U sing the same assessment nodes during baseline data gathering and as the Project effects come online enables a Before -After -Control- Impact approach to be applied. 6.5.2.2 Sampling Frequency and Locations The monitoring frequency of surface water level, surface flow, and groundwater level (water quan tity) will be continuous, using pressure transducers and dataloggers at stations: Along Blairmore Creek, from background station BC-H03 to the station adjacent to the minesite, BC-H02, and downstream stations BC-H01/b. Along Gold Creek, from background station GC-H03 to the stations adjacent to the mine site,GC-H04, GC-02, GC-01, and GC-HLLL, and downstream station WSC 05AA030.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 24 The Crowsnest River represents the receiving watercourse for both Gold and Blairmore creeks and is monitored year-round by WSC 05AA008.

BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 25 The proposed approach to surface hydrology monitoring has been subdivided into the main phases planned for the Project. D uring all periods, monitoring methods will be the same as those applied and described in the E IA (Addendum 1, CR #6, Appendix A2, and Appendix A3, CIAR #44). A s the Project progresses, monitoring methods may be updated to reflect evolving technologies and best practices. A n overview of the main differences expected between mine periods are as follows: Pre-Construction : Prior to mine construction occurring, the monito ring will remain unaltered from the 10 stations in Table 6.5-1 in order to : continue to improve knowledge of current and baseline water quantity conditions; and obtain data to refine the inputs and assumptions for flow-dependent modelling and predictions, such as chemical or constituent loading, instream flows, and mine water balances. Construction and Operations : The construction and operation monitoring system will be the most intensive phase of the monitoring program, given that EPEA monitoring is expect ed at all locations where water is discharged from mine site water management features. The F isheries Act monitoring will remain unaltered from Table 6.5-1, although by this stage it is expected that the BC -H01b station will have collected enough information to remove the need for existing BC-H01 station impacted by fault- line flow losses. Closure Phase: A number of EPEA monitoring sites will likely be removed given the reduction of active water management processes during this phase; however, the monitoring for Fisheries Act requirements will remain unaltered from the previous stage (9 stations) given the landscape changes that will have occurred relative to baseline. 6.5.2.3 Instream Flow Assessment Verification This component of the AMP includes the detection of changes in WSCT Area Weighted Suitability (AWS) at established microhabitat transects (within mesohabitat units) during the Instream Flow Assessment (IFA) in key reaches of Gold and Blairmore creeks. The purpose of this component is to verify predictions made during the IFA, evaluate whether adaptive mitigat ion is required, and implement and monitor mitigation effectiveness , if necessary. Baseline Characterization Monitoring will continue into the Project operations phase , at all 44 transects established for ongoing baseline monitoring within the IFA program, and nine additional pool tail-out sites established for baseline spawning surveys introduced in the next section. S everal of the transects will also serve as hydrometric monitoring statio ns. The IFA transects were focused on riffle, pool and run/glide mesohabitats, which dominate the mesohabitat distributions along each creek. F ive of these transects (BC -10, BC-11, BC-12 on Blairmore Creek , GC-9 and GC-13 on Gold Creek) were characterized with wetted -area substrate dominated by spawning gravels, which are essential to the spawning process and survival of WSCT in BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 26 these creeks. A dditional monitoring of spawning gravels, in addition to the above transects, was established at an additional nine sites, primarily pool tail- outs, with spawning gravels and high WSCT abundance . Here, additional sampling was conducted including Wolman pebble counts, from which worst -case shear stress differences during the life of mine were calculated . By maintaining this consistency between baseline and future monitoring locations, measured data can be directly compared to the predictions and effects assessment to verify effects are consistent with predictions in the EIA . Sampling schedule Project-area AWS estimates could theoretically be updated using the existing flow-hydraulic- habitat relationships developed using baseline, with Project- phase streamflow data as it becomes available through time. Ongoing monitoring of the flow-hydraulic-habit at relationships with transect data remain critical to capture changes in these relationships that may occur primarily due to channel geomorphology and substrate changes during high-flow events, and extreme low flow events yet to be adequately captured within the existing flow-hydraulic- habitat relationships. A three -times annual schedule of IFA -related monitoring, at all transects, is proposed including sampling during higher-flow period (May to June), lower- flow period (August to September) and intermedia te-flow period around spawning time (late- June to July) . The monitoring for intermediate - flow period also forms the primary data collection for the fluvial geomorphology component. 6.5.2.4 Fluvial Geomorphology Monitoring In concert with monitoring of discharge hydrology, WSCT population trends, and instream flows (IFA), the fluvial geomorphology monitoring will validate the predictions of the effects assessment of the mine development and determine the effectiveness of mitigating flow on channel morphology and sediment to inform adaptation of the mitigations as necessary based on monitoring results. The main purpose of monitoring will be to confirm that predictions made during the effects assessment remain valid, and to trigger adaptive mitigation if necessary . Monitoring may also identify unforeseen effects that were not predicted. Study Design The fluvial geomorphology monitoring has been designed for all phases of the Project including baseline, construction, operations, and closure phases. The fluvial geomorphology monitoring program was developed in conjunction with the baseline hydrology and instream f low monitoring components and the WSCT population monitoring. Monitoring locations will include 33 sites on Gold Creek and 20 sites on Blairm ore Creek that will be monitored through the mine lifecycle . Twenty -eight sites on Gold Creek and 16 sites cross-sections on Blairmore Creek were used in the IFA study (Addendum 1, CR #6, Appendix A3, CIAR #44). Four additional sites on Blairmore Creek and five sites on Gold Creek were identified as preferred WSCT spawning locations. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 27 Monumented cross-sections will be surveyed annually following the freshet to document fluctuations in channel cross-sectional morphology in Gold and Blairmore c reeks. Photographs of the bed and banks will be taken twice annually to document the condition of the bed and banks. M onitoring will document fluctuations in grai n size of spawning substrate in both c reeks . Grain size will be measured in the field annually following freshet . Wolman pebble counts will be completed with (N > 100) at the monitoring sites . The D 84, D50, and D 16 for each site will be compared annually to identify changes in bed sediment . The percent of sediment that is within the spawning grain size will be determined. Monitoring will target defined locations of spawning substrate in Gold and Blairmore c reeks. Spawning surveys are conducted annually and will identify the locations of WSCT spawning habitat. The location of spawning habitat will be compared annually to determine systematic changes in the locat ion of spawning habitat through the lifecycle of the P roject. 6.6 Westslope Cutthroat Trout Population Monitoring 6.6.1 Goals and Objectives The goal of this program is to monitor the long -term persistence and sustainability of WSCT in Gold and Blairmore creeks. The objectives of this plan will be to: build on snorkel surveys and extend the current population trend monitoring data (2016, 2017,2018, 2019) over a 10-year period; investigate with regulators the feasibility to continue with fry and juvenile density monitoringthat was executed in 2016 and develop a trend monitoring dataset; and collect detailed fish distribution, habitat utilization and trend monitoring data to support the Fisheries Offsetting Plan. These data will aim to establish information specific to WSCT population dynamics (population size, population demographics, WSCT distribution) over time to reduce uncertainty regarding the population trend and the long- term viability, persistence and sustainability of the WSCT populations inhabiting Gold Creek and upper Blairmore Creek. 6.6.2 Study Design 6.6.2.1 Baseline Characterization Baseline characterization began in 2016, and included spring spawning surveys, genetic sampling, condition factor (K), summer population assessments, employing a blended approach with both electro -fishing (fry/juvenile recruitment) and snorkel surveys (adult/subadult population estimates) and over-wintering surveys. Subsequently, to reduce the handling of WSCT, snorkel surveys were employed during 2017, 2018 and 2019 during spring spa wning, summer rearing and overwintering. To characterize fry/juvenile recruitment without the use of electrofishing, visual counts of fry (young of the year) and juveniles (<10 cm fork length [FL ]) were completed during the snorkel surveys. Fork-BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 28 length informs population size and demographic structure. These surveys will continue on an annual basis until Project construction and operations commence. During baseline characterization, representative survey index sites were established, and annual data were collected for each site. Snorkel surveys were generally conducted in the spring (spawning), summer (rearing) and early winter (overwinter) seasons, focusing on abundance, fork length (FL) by class, and habitat use. The AMP is designed to continue building a robust dataset characterizing the WSCT populations in Gold and Blairmore creeks by collecting repeatable data collected using consistent methodology over time. 6.6.2.2 Sampling Locations The location of the monitoring sites has been chosen to ens ure all habitat types are ecologically represented including sites upstream and downstream of potential P roject effects . The WSCT populations in Gold and Blairmore creeks will be monitored using adult/sub-adult population estimates and annual recruitment of fry/juvenile (0+, 1+) density estimates using the following metrics: population size; population demographics; and fish distribution. 6.6.2.3 Thresholds and Targets The threshold or target of this monitoring is to ensure the persistence and recovery of WSCT populations during Project operations, decommissioning and closure within natural variation. The data collected as part of this monitoring will be used with data collected from other monitoring programs (including the proposed Fisheries Offsetting Plan) to generate a better understanding of WSCT population status. Construction and Operations The construction and operations monitoring phase will continue to follow the annual baseline monitoring through the life of the P roject . The frequency of monitoring may be required to address specific potential Projects effects on WSCT populations within the LSA and may require an adaptive approach to both monitoring and mitigation strategies to ensure defined population targets are maintained. Closure This monitoring phase will address potential effects the closure of the mining site may have on the WSCT populations. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 29 6.7 Bioenergetics Monitoring 6.7.1 Goals and Objectives The overall goal of this program is to monitor potential changes in aquatic habitat required for the survival and persistence of WSCT in Blairmore and Gold creeks. This program will provide baseline information regarding food availability and fish condition, as well as a comprehensive methodology for monitoring fish condition in the LSA . The implemen tation of the bioenergetics monitoring will help the Project better understand potential effects to WSCT caused by up- land mine disturbance. T he objectives of this plan will be to: quantify the food energy provided to WSCT by their primary food supply, dr ifting invertebrates; quantify individual fish condition, based on relative weight (Wr); integrate food energy, fish condition, and hydrological monitoring data into a species- specific bioenergetics model; quantify any changes in food supply, individual fish condition, and fish population condition; determine the causes of any observed changes in food supply, individual condition, and/orpopulation condition, to facilitate adaptive management and offsetting/mitigation programs;and present a standard methodology for data collection and interpretation for bioenergetics monitoring . 6.7.2 Study Design 6.7.2.1 Baseline Characterization A full site characterization study will occur prior to as well as during the first implementation cycle of the plan. T his will include riparian vegetation loss delineation and quantification, and dilution zone delineation downstream of each effluent discharge point on Blairmore Creek. T hese data will help identify suitable sampling areas as well as identify potential confounding factors that may affect data interpretation. 6.7.2.2 Sample Area Selection Site selection is an important factor when developing effective bioenergetics monitoring . It will be important to capture sites that will be directly impacted by receiving mine waters, a s well as appropriate reference locations. Samples will be required to be taken from two types of exposure areas, and reference areas. Exposure Areas Mine exposure is a key part of the site selection process as mine influenced streams have increased potential for deleterious effects on fish condition . All treated contact water will be discharged to BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 30 Blairmore Creek, however given that Gold Creek is designated critical habitat under the Species at Risk Act , the reaches of Gold Creek downstream of the mine are included in the study design. By monitoring Gold Creek for potential changes in fish condition, uncertainty associated with other influences not related to mine activity will be reduced. Areas exposed to mine influences will be separated into two cate gories . These are defined as follows: Treated Contact Water Exposure Area: all fish habitat and waters that are exposed to treated contact water and frequented by fish; and Riparian Exposure Area: all fish habitat and waters frequented by fish at and downstream of areas where riparian vegetation has been removed. It is foreseeable that some exposure areas will see effects from both treated contact water and riparian vegetation removal. H owever, all efforts will be made to delineate sample locations that w ill adequately distinguish between the two potential impact sources. Reference Areas Inclusion of reference streams allows the plan to provide context for the extent, degree, and trends of deleterious effects on fish condition occurring in mine- affected st reams . Monitoring reference streams will be of particular importance with respect to evaluating potential long -term and large- scale spatial effects as they will provide information pertaining to natural environmental variability. Reference streams were selected from areas in the LSA that were consistent over the long term, while also preferentially being located a sufficient distance from potential future mine development. A s the reference streams need to mimic conditions in the mine -affected streams as closely as possible, parameters such as elevation, stream order, geology and channel morphology were also considered during the selection process. Reference streams were selected using the following criteria: Characterization of exposure reaches by stream order, bedrock geology, spatial distribution and channel morphology. Review of reference sites from past studies in the area such as the baseline assessment (Addendum 1, CR #6 Appendix A1, CIAR #44), and select appropriate locations using reach characteristics. Review additional locations to obtain reference streams that will adequately represent the spectrum of stream characteristics expected in the mine -affected streams. The above criteria revealed several possible locations for reference streams. T hose most relevant to the monitoring objectives are upper Blairmore Creek (above the proposed mine footprint) and Caudron Creek. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 31 6.7.2.3 Sample Timing and Frequency Sampling will occur twice annually, during summer and fall . Terrestrial inputs to drift invertebrate assemblage are generally highest during summer, and fall should allow measurement of young- of-year fish. Two annual measurements for both food supply and fish condition will also help evaluate and calibrate the bioenergetics model. 6.7.2.4 Data Collection 6.7.2.4.1.1.1 Temperature Monitoring Stream temperature is an important component of bioenergetics modeling, as it can influence energy output, consumption, and growth rates, and has been linked to the spatial distribution of WS CT (Deslauriers et al. 2017) . Stream temperature will be monitored using continuous in -situ dataloggers placed at each established sample station and will be supplemented with long -term stream temperature data that is being collected at multiple hydrometric stations in Blairmore and Gold creeks . Dataloggers will be visited and read on a quarterly basis to mitigate potential data loss due to battery drain or loss of the units. Temperature and light dataloggers will be installed in 30 cm long PVC enclosures, and secured to the stream bed . Loggers will be set to record temperature and light intensity every 30 minutes . Additionally, stream temperature data collected at multiple long -term hydrometric stations (installed in both Blairmore and Gold creeks) w ill supplement sample station data. 6.7.2.4.1.1.2 Drift Invertebrates Drift invertebrates are the primary source of food for WSCT and encompass both aquatic invertebrates drifting in the water column, and terrestrial or aerial invertebrates, drifting on the surface . By collecting drift invertebrate samples and determining the biomass of the respective aquatic and terrestrial components, the available food energy can be estimated for a given area. Drift inver tebrate assemblage data in the form of total abundance, diversi ty, and biomass is generally expressed per unit volume (m3), where: (3) = (2)\u00d7 () \u00d7 () biomass and flow will be the primary data used for interpretation; and characterizing the taxonomic composition of the drift using metrics such as richness, diversity, or presence/absence of certain taxa (depending on their propensity to drift) may prove usefulfor interpretation for specific projects. Collection of drift samples requires flowing water and is, therefore, only suitable for erosional zones in freshwater habitats; moderate -flowing riffle areas in rivers and streams . Approximate site locations will be identified prior to commencement of the monitoring plan . However, exact site locations within BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 32 the reach should be selected in the field to ensure that an appropriate environment is sampled. D etailed procedures will be outlined prior to the implementation of this plan and adapted from Cavanagh et al. (1997), Lewis et al. (2004), Hatfield et al. (2007) . 6.7.2.4.1.1.3 Fish Condition The condition of an individual fish can be easily estimated by using a ratio between length and weight. When combined, the condition of each individual fish in a sample can then be used to estimate overall population health. T hese two parameters (length and weight) will be collected during all fish capture . The method of determining fish condition will be Relative Weight (Wege and Anderson 1978). Fish will be collec ted using a combination of backpack electrofishing and minnow trapping. The procedures will be adapted from federal and provincial guidance ( e.g., AFMB 2013a, 2013b; ECCC 2012) with an emphasis on minimizing or eliminating potential harm and handling time. Federal guidance for non -lethal sampling recommends a minimum of 100 age 1+ fish from each sampling area (ECCC 2012). However, given the potential impact that such sampling effort would have on WSCT in the study watercourses, the objective for this pro gram will be collection and measurement of 50 age 1+ fish per site. P ower analyses indicate that a total sa mple (n) of 250-500 fish should be sufficient to detect small- to-medium effects at a statistical significance threshold ( p) less than 0.1. Relative Weight (Wr) Relative weight is a measure that compares the actual weight of an individual to its expected weight (standard weight) based on a standard weight equation ( Blackwell et al. 2000). The equation was first proposed 40 years ago for Large mouth Bass ( Wege and Anderson 1978) and has been regularly used as a fish condition metric since ( Blackwell et al. 2000). It can be used to infer whether a population of fish is well -fed and growing as would be expected ( Blackwell et al. 2000). R elative weight is often express ed as an average and will be used in this study to examine the growth efficiency of WSCT within the study area at various size classes. =\u00d7100 [1] Where W = actual fish weight (g) W s = standard w eight (g) Standard weight equations are created based on regressions of the length-weight relationships of many fish populations across the species' range. The goal is to represent the weight of a fish in \"good condition\" by estimating the weight of a fish at the 75 th percentile based on its length ( Midas BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 33 et al. 2013). F or this plan , the standard weight equation used was proposed for North American lotic rainbow trout by total length (mm) WSC T captured during field surveys will be measured for both fork leng th (FL) and total length (TL), thus avoiding any confounding factors due to requiring a conversion equation. Relative weight can be highly variable, but generally a well-fed fish in good condition will have a W r around 100 ( Midas et al. 2013). F ish with W r > 100 are above average and in very good condition, and fish with W r < 100 are below average ( Midas et al. 2013). G enerally, fish with W r between 80 and 100 are within the range of healthy populations ( Anderson and Neumann 1996). 6.7.2.5 Data Integration Data collected as part of the bioenergetics monitoring field plans will be integrated using Fish Bioenergetics 4.0 (Deslauriers et al. 2017). T his program integrates multiple environmental and physiological inputs, including stream temperature, energy density and type of prey, the energy lost through movement and respiration, spawning/reproduction, and mortality. T hese variables will be input into existing bioenergetics models for WSCT (or generating a new model if species -specific models are not available) to generate curves and parameters such as growth rate, consumption, net production, and population dynamics, over the course of a year for a given cohort (life stage). 6.7.2.6 Quantifying Potent ial Changes in Response to Project Activities Potential changes due to Project activities will be quantified by comparing the model outputs from reference areas to mine -affected areas. C oarse, visual comparisons will accompany more robust statistical comp arisons . The refinement of study areas conducted during preliminary site selection should also facilitate comparison between both predicted effect sources (effluent and riparian loss). 7.0 MITIGATION EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATION AND ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT 7.1 Overview The AMP's mitigation effectiveness evaluation and adaptive management approach will involve establishing indicators and thresholds according to baseline characterization, improved practices based on research and monitoring results, and input from the public engagement and Indigenous consultation programs . As the Project proceeds, monitoring throughout all Project phases will allow water quality targets to be reviewed and, if necessary, modifications can be made to site expectations. BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 34 Mitigation effectivene ss evaluation and a daptive management is a planned and systematic process for continuously improving environmental management practices by learning about their outcomes. Mitigation effectiveness evaluation and a daptive management provides flexibility to identify and implement new mitigation measures or to modify existing ones during the life of a project. A s per Figure 7.1-1, Benga's program is organized into four main components, which are reevaluated and reassessed in a feedback loop. Figure 7.1-1 - Adaptive Management Feedback Loop Adaptive management itself, is intended to respond to changes and advances in technology or to react to measured outcomes that are different from those predicted during the EIA . Benga understands that outcomes that are different from modelled predictions may result from areas of uncertainty including: Representativeness of input data - the EIA analysis is based on information about the P roject from sampling that may not be representative of Project condition s. For example, the amount of selenium present in the waste rock is from a limited number of rock samples . If these sample turn out to be not representative, the total amount of selenium loading could be greater or smaller. Other assumptions used for modelling the Project - Some parts of the EIA analysis are based on assumptions using professional judgement and where possible, conservative bias. Ther e is a possibility that these assumptions may be incorrect and lead to unexpected impacts. Assess the Problem Adaptive Management Process Design Implement, Monitor & Evaluate Adjust the Mitigation as Required BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 35 Errors and omis sions - Although the EIA analysis has been conducted with care and using quality control procedures to minimize errors, there is always a possibility that errors and omissions could lead to outcomes that are not currently foreseen. Unforeseen external fact ors - During the Project life, it is possible that currently unforeseen external or environmental changes could work to create a cumulative effect with the Projectthat is not included in the EIA analysis. With respect to Project mitigation effectiveness evaluation and adaptive management, Benga is committed to achieving continual improvement in environmental performance. T he development and implementation of all monitoring and mitigation identified for the Project and housed in the monitoring and follow- up programs will be tracked in relevant management plans . As site conditions and monitoring dictate, or as new technology emerges, Benga will adaptively manage its site practices and monitoring program to meet the defined objectives . For some programs this would involve regular evaluation of predictive models; which would be clearly defined in each applicable management plan. In summary, if a monitoring and mitigation effectiveness evaluation identif y that adverse environmental effects are greater than predicted, Benga will evaluate whether they result in changes to the conclusions presented in the effects assessment . If changes are confirmed, Benga will evaluate the need for revised mitigation actions and management practices to manage effects. W here the need for revised or additional mitigation is identified, these will be further developed and implemented. 7.2 Assess the Problem Assessing the problem includes an assessment of the uncertainty associated with the mitigation effectiveness, the likelihood that the uncertainty can be reduced and, the opportunities to refine , modify or augment the mitigation measures . 7.3 Adaptive Management Process Design Once the problem has been identified and assessed, the design of the adaptive management program can commence, beginning with determining the best approach to adaptive management . The following are design considerations for the adaptive management program: data analysis methods and frequency; predicted trajectories for indicators; and triggers for action and potential adaptations.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 36 Benga is confident in the mitigation measures selected but acknowledges that a formal process may be warranted to optimize the measures, as opportunities to refine aspects of the management strategies are available. T his formal process includes the following points: predicted trajectories through time for the indicators as described in the EIA ; an AMP designed to allow observed trends to be compared to predicted trajectories; and triggers for action, should predicted trajectories and observed trends not align, and a plan of action if and when triggers are pulled. 7.4 Implement, Monitor and Evaluate The mitigation described throughout the EI A will be incorporated into monitoring plans for the Project. F inal monitoring protocols will be established and baseline data will be collected soon after the Project is approved so that trends and progress can be evaluated. If indicators meet targets or align with desired trends, no adaptive management is required although continuing assessment of new technology and best practices may reveal an opportunity for improvement. S hould indicators not meet targets or trends diverge from the desired trajectory, a sequence of Project -specific actions will be triggered . Prior to adjusting any mitigation, steps will be taken to investigate the observations, as necessary . If required, the following sequence will be followed: Monitoring results will be verified and investigated. Possible adaptations to mitigation will be identified and evaluated based on monitoring results. A work plan will be developed to adapt mitigation or monitoring, if required. 7.5 Adjust the Mitigation as Required If mitigation adjustments are determined to be required, then they will be implemented with careful consideration to proper planning, approvals, notifications and consultation. I n this step of the adaptive management process, the work plan will be implemented. Any required notifications or approvals will be obtained before acting to confirm that all interested or affected parties are properly informed . If adjustments to mitigation measures are req uired, Section 5.0 of this Plan will be updated to reflect the adapted mitigation for the Project. Table 7.5-1 outlines a daptive management adjustments that could be implemented if monitoring indicates that aquatic parameters are not meeting targets . Since the monitoring plan has not been implemented, nor monitoring conducted, these are options for consideration.

Minimize or eliminate changes to surface water quality, which can affect aquatic resources and WSCT habitat quantity and suitability and/or survival an d reproduction of WSCT. Operational adjustments to the SBZ andother water management infrastructureto achieve better results. Implementation of Gravel Bed Reactor(GBR) contingency measure. Implementation of an active watertreatment facility (AWTF) co ntingency measure. Addition of a metals treatment plant.A GBR consists of an engineered bed of gravel/mediathrough which water containing constituents of concern (e.g., nitrate and selenium) is passed for treatment. E xamples of an effective application of the GBR technology for the treatment of selenium include a full scale GBR implemented to effectively reduce selenium concentrations in surface water from approximately 40 \u00b5g/L to less than 5 \u00b5g/L over an operating period of nearly eight years, to meet t he requirements of Irvine Ranch Water District's (IRWD's)Nitrogen and Selenium Management Program (Manciniet al. 2019) . AWTFs that implement fluidized bed reactor technology is an effective process for removal of selenium . This is the same technology that was chosen and installed by Teck at its Line Creek Operations , which has been shown to efficiently reduce selenium concentrations to below 20 ug/L based on a capacity of 7,500 m 3/day. Water treatment plants to remove metals like zinc and cobalt are proven technology. Changes to aquatic and/or riparian habitat for WSCT associated with the Project footprint. Minimize or eliminate changes to aquatic and/or riparian habitat for WSCT. Implementation of additional fishoffsetting measures ( e.g., development of additional pool habitat, additionalriparian vegetation) . Implementation of additional riparianvegetation as part of the Conservationand Reclamation Plan .The Project's Fisheries Offsetting Plan was developed toadhere with the goals and objectives of the DFO Fisheries Protection Provisions (FPP) of the Fisheries Act , the Species at Risk Act Permitting Policy and the WSCT Recovery Strateg y, and would be revisited accordingly based on any pertinent regulatory updates ( i.e., updates to reco very strategies) . Proposed C&R Plans are proven industry standards andmonitoring of C&R mitigation effectiveness will be conducted early in the mine life (via progressive reclamation), which will confirm whether the measures aresuccessful or unsuccessful . This approach will allow for timely consultation with Indigenous groups to discuss findings and make appropriate adjustments to ensure thelessons learned are applied to subsequent reclamation years.BENGA MINING LIMITED Grassy Mountain Coal Project Aquatic Monitoring Plan February 2020 Page 38 Table 7.5-1 Potential Project Effects, Adaptive Management Options and Effectiveness Potential Project Effects Mitigation Objectives Economic or Technically Feasible Adaptive Management Option(s) Adaptive Management Effectiveness Changes in water temperature, which may cause changes to the thermal regime, affecting WSCT habitat quantity and suitability .

(Benga) received the \"Joint Review Panel Information Request Package #6 \" (CIAR #295) which included a request to include water -based exposure pathways as a part of the Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) ( JRP Information Request [IR] 6.27) . In response to this request, this add endum to the HHRA took into consideration water -based exposure pathways (both groundwater and surface water) within the Local Study Area (LSA) (including the end pit lake [EPL], Blairmore Creek and Gold Creek) , as well as the Regional Study Area (RSA), including the Crowsnest River and the Oldman Reservoir. Of note, while not independently assessed, consideration of the Crowsnest River was addressed as surface water concentrations would be lower than those predicted at Blairmore Creek . Therefore, consideration of the potential for human health ris k within Blairmore Creek is inherently protective of the Crowsnest River. 2.0 OBJECTIVES AND SCOP E OF WORK The scope of this human health risk assessment ( HHRA ) update was consistent with the final Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Project issued by the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER 2015) and the Guidelines for the Preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement issued by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CIAR #11 ). In specific response to JRP IR-6.27 (a) and (b) the following revisions were incorporated into the HHRA update: Assessment of water -based exposure pathways (both groundwater and surface water) within the EPL (at Closure), and the downstream receiving aquatic environments, with the inclusionof the Oldman Reservoir using predicted concentrations of contaminants of potential concern(COPC) as well as predicted concentrations within the Oldman Reservoir; Specific consideration of an Indigenous group conceptual site model (CSM) indicatinglinkages between the Project and indigenous specific routes of exposure; and Revision of the risk characterization including both a contaminant -by-contaminant assessment as well as a cumulative risk analysis (sum of all HQs) addressing the cumulative exposure toall COPCs from all pathways. 3.0 PROBLEM FORMULATI ON The Project related chemical source contribution requiring detailed exposure risk modell ing and assessment, as part of the HHRA update, was expanded to include water -based exposure(s). Human health risk was evaluated based on exposure to water, soil, ai r and food (both plant and animal Benga Mi ning Limited Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 2 14-00201-00 based) within the LSA, EPL, RSA, Blairmore Creek, Gold Cree k, Crowsnest River and the Oldman Reservoir. The problem formulation presented herein is an update (as applicable) to the Grassy Mountain Coal Project Environmental Impact Assessment Updated Human Health and Wildlife Screening Risk Assessment (Addendum 1 0, Appendix 4.9-1, CIAR #251) and is the basis by which applicable chemicals, receptors, exposure scenarios and exposure pathways are defined within the risk asses sment. 3.1 Identification and Characterization of Receptors 3.1.1 Receptor Exposure Locations and Groups The HHRA -update considered the LSA, (EPL [ at Closure ], Blairmore Creek, Gold Creek), and the RSA (Crowsnest River and the Oldman Reservoir) and assessed the maximum chemical concentrations predicted by the air quality assessment within these locations. It should be noted that aerial deposition caused by operational activities were not included in assessment of the EPL which does not exist during operations nor at the Oldman Reservoir as the Project was deemed to have negligible aerial contaminant contribution at this receptor location. Finally, provided that the assessment considered maximum depositional loading at Blairmore Creek and that all potential chemical loading accumulates within the Oldman Reservoir, an independent evaluation of Crowsnest River was not required (a prediction of health risk within Blairmore Creek or within the Oldman Reservoir act as a conservative approximation of the potential for human health risk elsewhere). 3.1.2 Receptor Characteristics Human receptors were identified as those people potentially impacted by the Project and included consideration for I ndigenous residents, agricultural residents, other area residents, workers and visitors to the area . The HHRA assessed Indigenous resident receptor for the quantitative exposure and risk modeling as that receptor was expected to have the propensity of contaminant exposure. Receptors were further defined by age groups (infant, toddler, child, teen, and adult ) consistent with Health Canada (2010a) . Indigenous receptor characteristics are summarized in Table 3-1.

Benga Mi ning Limited Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 4 14-00201-00 3.2 Chemical Inventory The che mical inventory was expanded to include all groundwater and surface water associated COPCs , as well as those parameters previously identified through an inventory of expected Project air emissions, as described in the Air Quality Assessment (EIA, CR #1a, CI AR #42) and in the Grassy Mountain Coal Project Environmental Impact Assessment Updated Human Health and Wildlife Scre ening Risk Assessment (Addendum 10, Appendix identified for the project included: criteria air contaminants (CACs) (air only) ; metals (air and water) ; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (air only) ; and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) . The HHRA (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.9-1, CIAR #251) evaluated the potential health risks for all identified COPCs for which adequate toxicological data was available. A list of the chemicals included in the HHRA update is presented in Table 3-2. Table 3-2 Chemicals of Potential Concern (COPCs) Chemical Group Chemicals Criteria Air Contaminants Carbon Monoxide (CO) Nitrogen Dioxide (NO 2)Sulphur Dioxide (SO 2)Particulate Matter <2.5 \u00b5m (PM 2.5) Antimony Arsenic Barium Beryllium Bismuth Cadmium Chromium II, III Chromium Cobalt CopperFluoride Iron Lead Lithium Magnesium Manganese Mercury Molybdenum Nickel Potassium Silver Strontium Thallium Tin Titanium Uranium Vanadium Zinc ZirconiumBenga Mi ning Limited Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 5 14-00201-00 Table 3-2 Chemicals of Potential Concern (COPCs) Chemical DPM were included as COPCs in response to Alberta Energy Regulator (AER), Health Canada (HC) and the Joint Review Panel (JRP) Information Requests (IRs), including: AER IAR #2 51). Assessment of acute and chronic inhalation was completed for all COPCs with relevant TRVs. A multimedia exposure assessment, which included exposure through secondary oral and dermal contact pathways, was completed for a subset of dendum 10, Appendix 4.9-1, CIAR #251 ). The screening process for the multimedia assessment was based on guidance from the US EPA (2003) and California EPA (1994) using physical/chemical properties of the COPCs. Following this guidance, only those COPCs wi th low volatility indicating potential to be present in media other than air and those COPC s which may bioaccumulate in plant or animal tissue over time were included (details of the screening methodology are p rovided metals were assumed to persist in the environment and were automatically included in consideration of the multimedia assessment except for those parameters considered innocuous or predic ted at concentrations consistent with measured background . The following parameters were screened out of the human health multimedia assessment: Bismuth - used in the treatment of upset stomach, heartburn and diarrhea (it is the active ingredient in Pepto Bismol\u00ae) and considered an innocuous parameter. Calcium - predicted at concentrations consistent with measured background and is an essential nutrient and considered an innocuous parameter. Benga Mining Limited Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 6 14-00201-00 Chloride - predicted at concentrations consistent with measured b ackground. Fluoride - considered beneficial in the prevention of dental caries and predicted concentrations in surface water are lower than the Health Canada drinking water quality guideline (Health Canada 2019). Iron - no evidence exists of dietary iron toxicity in the general population (Health Canada 2019) and is considered an innocuous parameter. Silver - predicted at concentrations consistent with measured background. Lithium - predicted at concentrations consistent with measured background. Potassium - an essential nutrient and an innocuous parameter. Magnesium - an essential nutrient and no evidence of adverse health effects from magnesium in drinking water (Health Canada 2019) and is considered an innocuous parameter. Nitrate an d Nitrite - chemicals are non-bioaccumulating and predicted concentrations meet (are lower) than drinking water quality standards in Canada. Phosphorus - the second most abundant mineral within the body and considered an innocuous parameter. 3.3 Indigenous Conceptual Site Mode l An Indigenous Group specific conceptual site model ( CSM) is provided in Figure 3-1. This CSM illustrates an overview of the results of the problem formulation . This model was designed to represent predicted exposures for all potential Indigenous receptors. 3.3.1 Indigenous Exposure Pathway Identification In the \" Grassy Mountain Coal Project Environmental Impact Assessment Updated Human Health and Wildlife Screening Risk Assessment \" (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.9-1, CIAR #251), d irect inhalation of air was assumed to be the primary exposure pathway with several secondary pathways also identified for the multimedia assessment (including both ingestion and dermal contact). This response includes those same potential water -based exposure pathways (surface and ground water) with consideration of using predicted concentrations from JRP IR-6.26, updated model predictions . This addendum to the HHRA assessment includes the following exposure pathway considerations : COPCs in air deposited onto soil in the surrounding area. Receptors may then be exposed by direct contact with soil, surface water, inadvertent ingestion of soil, and inhalation of dust. COPCs in local vegetation, through direct depositio n from air or uptake from affected soils. Receptors may then be exposed b y ingestion of local vegetation. COPCs in soil, plants, and water can be ingested by local wildlife. Receptors may then be exposed by ingestion of local wild game. Benga Mining Limited Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 7 14-00201-00 COPCs in water (both groundwater and surface water) within the LSA (including the EPL) asso ciated with Project activiti es, which may impart a direct effect on surface water receptors. Receptors may then be exposed through ingestion of surface water, contact with surface water , ingestion of wild fish and game . Aquatic vegetation and fish were c onsidered in order to conservatively estimate total potential exposure to the human receptor . A qualitative assessment of potential human exposure to groundwater via drinking water wells was conducted ( EIA, CR #3, Section 5.0, CIAR #42 ). There are no conf irmed domestic wells identified within the proposed mine permit boundary . The potential for domestic wells to be drilled and completed within the mine permit boundary is low, as the underlying bedrock units are not very permeable. The prim ary unit that c ould be considered for the completion of domestic wells would be the surficial deposits associated with Gold Creek or Blairmore Creek (alluvium) . Groundwater quality in those aquifers would be similar to the quality of the associated surface water and the groundwater would be expected to be classified as groundwater under the influence of surface water (GWUDI). The bedrock formations (shale or sandstone) are competent units with limited porosity, except where occasional fractures are encountered, which ca n be time consuming and expensive to target. The few industrial wells present within the LSA, and monitoring wells installed for the assessment of the Project, indicated that wells completed in bedrock had low head and limited available yield. Project ac tivities may release selenium, nitrate and nitrite which will be actively managed and treated on Site . The Project is designed so the mining operations will last 25 years, followed by approximately 50 years of active water management and reclam ation . During this period, the Project will be controlled by Benga and no external users will have access to the Site. The average residence time for groundwater in the system will generally be greater than 50 years and therefore provides ample time for attenuation of selenium and nitrate to occur . In the unlikely event that a domestic use water well would be drilled within the mine permit boundary once the project is reclaimed, groundwater will have returned to baseline conditions. Therefore, human consump tion of groundwater within the RSA by way of a domestic use water well was not considered as a component of the HHRA -update. A summary of the applicable exposure pathway for Indigenous receptor groups is presented in Table 3-3.

The results of the inhalation assessment remain unchanged in consideration of the water -based exposure pathway update. 4.2 Multimedia Exposure The multimedia exposure assessment evaluated secondary exposure through oral and dermal routes. The processes involved are only relevant for chemicals that can potentially accumulate in media other than air; many of the COPC associated with Project emissions are too volatile to be present in soil, water or food. The COPCs assessed in the multimedia assessment are provided in Table 4-1. Benga Mining Limited Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 9 14-00201-00 Table 4-1 Chemicals of Potential Con cern (COPCs) - Multimedia Exposure Chemical Groups Chemicals Metals Aluminum Antimony Arsenic Barium Beryllium Cadmium Chromium (II, III and VI) Cobalt Copper Lead Manganese Mercury Molybdenum Nickel Selenium Formaldehyde The multimedia assessment included consideration of background/ambient concentrations of COPCs in the Baseline and Application cases, combined with predictive modelling based on Project air emissions. The multimedia modelling equations published by US EPA (2005) were used to predict the concentrations of airborne COPCs occurring in soil, surface water, pla nts, and wild game. Deterministic calculations were used based on predicted air concentration and deposition rates, published physical-chemical properties of the COPCs, expected physical conditions within the study area, and physical characteristics of hu man receptors. Reasonable worst-case assumptions were used in the calculations. Complete details on the model inputs, equations, and a sample calculation are provided in JRP 10, Appendix Calculations, CIAR #251). The multi -media model predicted total exposure doses as mg/kg body weight/day for each receptor age group and location, each of which were carried forward into the risk characterization (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.9-1, Appendix C : Detailed Multimedia Model Results, CIAR #251). An HHRA baseline sampling program was conducted July 22-31, 2014 and September 5-9, 2014. The HHRA baseline sampling program included the collection and chemical analysis of vegetation and soil samples. Within the program, efforts were made to collect berries and leaves typically consumed Benga Mining Limited Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 10 14-00201-00 through loc al harvesting; the results were dependant on the time of year samples were collected and the availability of specific species in the areas sampled. Complete results from the soil and vegetation sampling progr am are provided 10, Program , CIAR #251 ). A total of 21 soil samples and 25 vegetation samples were collected from the soils and vegetation LSAs respectively and were analyzed for metals and PAHs. Where there were enough samples, th e 95th percentile background soil concentrations were applied to the baseline and application scenarios (AHW 2011). These concentrations were included in exposure calculations for the HHRA. Where media conce ntrations were measured as below detection limit, the input value used for the exposure modelling was the highest of either half the detection limit, or the concentration predicted via deposition an d uptake in the multi -media model. 5.0 TOXICITY ASSESSME NT The toxicity assessment involves establishing the relationship between the amount of a chemical to which a person is exposed over a specified duration, and the potential for adverse health effects. The exposure limit, or the amount of chemical identified to be a safe exposure concentration is the toxicity reference value (TRV). Within the toxicity assessment step of the HHRA, TRVs are identified for all COPCs and exposure pathways. The TRVs were identified for both acute and chronic inhalation exposures. F or those chemicals evaluated under the multimedia assessment, chronic oral TRVs were also identified. The TRVs were obtained from recognized regulatory agencies, including: Alberta Environment and Parks (AEP); Health Canada; United States Environmental Pr otection Agency (US EPA); World Health Organizat ion (WHO); Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR); California Office of Environmental and Human Health Assessment (OEHHA); Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ); Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM); and Other agencies where appropriate for specific chemicals. The basis for each available TRV was evaluated to select the most appropriate value, giving consideration to consistency with Alberta a pproaches, scientific defensibility, incorporation of the most current information, and conservatism. Benga Mining Limited Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 11 14-00201-00 Selected TRVs for acute and chronic inhalation are summarized in the Grassy Mountain Coal Project Environmental Impact Assessment Updated Human Health and Wildlife Screening Risk Assessment (Addendum 10 -update specifically evaluated the potential for adverse effect in consideration of water -based exposure pathway these tables remain unadjusted and are not repurposed for this report .

Consistent with Health Canada (2010a) recommendations, where chemicals have similar effects on the same target organs, they were assumed to have additive toxicity ( i.e., the toxic effec ts are combined). As part of the toxicity evaluations, chemicals were assigned to toxicity groups based on critical effects and target organs. These groups are summarized in Table 5-2 for chronic oral exposures . All COPCs within a toxicity group were assumed to have additive toxicity. Potential toxicity associated with these chemical groups was evaluated in this HHRA -update with consideration of surface and groundwater exposures. Benga Mining Limited Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 13 14-00201-00 Table 5-2 Toxicity Endpoint Groups1 Exposure Pathway and Duration Toxicity E ndpoint COPC Chronic Oral Gastrointestinal Beryllium, Total Chromium, Tumours Benzo[a]pyrene group 1Toxicity endpoint IR AER -170 (Addendum 5, C IAR #69 ). 5.2 Multiple-Exposure Route Potential Receptors are potentially exposed to both individual chemicals and chemical mixtures originating from chronic inhalation exposure as well as multimedia exposures (oral and dermal) which have similar critical effects pathways (e.g. , liver, kidney, neurologi cal and lu ng). Additive risk is more than a chemical by chemical evaluation and specifically evaluates the potential for human health risk due to cumulative exposure to all COPCs from all pathways (including water -based pathways). All COPCs within a toxicity group were assumed to have additive toxicity irrespective of their exposure route (inhalation, oral or dermal). 6.0 RISK CHARACTERIZATION Risk characterization is the stage where the results of the exposure and toxicity assessments are combined to evaluat e potential risks to human receptors. Risks are characterized using hazard quotients (HQ) for non-carcinogenic COPCs. An HQ is simply the ratio of the predicted exposure to the appropriate exposure limit (TC/RfC or TDI/RfD). An HQ less than 1.0 indicates that predicted exposures are less than the TRV and adverse effects are not predicted . In response to IR HC -R2-11 (Addendum 8 , Part B, C IAR #89 ) the potential risks of adverse health effects were compared to a more conservative HQ of 0.2 instead of 1.0 so as to ac count for potential exposures from background sources not included in the HHRA ( e.g., store bought foods and consumer products). Benga Mining Limited Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 14 14-00201-00 For non -threshold chemicals, the potential risk of adverse health effects was assessed using an incremental lifetime cancer ris k (ILCR). The ILCR was calculated by multiplying the predicted exposure by the appropriate slope factor or unit risk. An ILCR of less tha n 1x10-5 indicates that the predicted risks are less than 1 in 100,000 a value considered \"essentially neg ligible\" by both Alberta and Federal health agencies (AHW 2011; Health Canada 2010a,b) . Due to the number of conservative assumptions purposefully built into the HHRA, an HQ greater than 0.2 or an ILCR value greater than 1 x 10-5 does not automatically indicate a potential risk of adverse health effects. Instead, it is an indication that additional in -depth assessment is required for the individual risk result. The additional assessment includes a review of the conservative assumptions made in the toxicity and expos ure assessment steps of the HHRA. The purpose of the review is to determine whether the result represents a potential risk of adverse health effects or simply are the result of the conservative assumptions made during the HHRA calculations. 7.0 RESULTS AND DI SCUSSION The HHRA assessed potential health risks at the maximum point of impingement (MPOI) in the RSA (RSA-MPOI) as well as risks relating to human health exposure caused by surface water exposures at Blairmore Creek, Gold Creek, the EPL (at Closure), an d the Oldman Reservoir . Depositional assumptions to surface water bodies used the RSA -MPOI estimates as a conservative approximation of the potential for risk as this conservatively represents the highest levels of predicted human exposure. 7.1 Acut e and Chronic Inhalation The results of the inhalation health exposure assessment are presented in the Grassy Mountain Coal Project Environmental Impact Assessment Updated Human Health and Wildlife Screening Risk Assessment (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.9-1, CI AR #251). T he results of the inhalation assessment remain unchanged in consideration of the water -based exposure pathway update. 7.2 Chronic Multimedia Exposure 7.2.1 HQ and ILCR Results Long-term (chronic) risks from the multimedia exposure assessment were evaluated for COP Cs emitted from the Project which could potentially accumulate in the environment. This assessment focuses on secondary exposure to these COPCs through oral and dermal exposure pathways. HQ and cumulative ILCR results were calculated assuming Indigenous receptor characteristics as they represent the most sensitive receptor group based on their assumed lifetime exposure within the LSA and RSA, and a higher assumed ingest ion rate of traditional and country foods ( local fish, wild Benga Mining Limited Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 15 14-00201-00 game and vegetation) than ot her receptor groups. HQs and cumulative ILCR values for all other receptors at the same locations would inherently be lower. It was conservatively assumed that the Indigenous receptor lived at, and harvested food from all the HHRA receptor locations including the RSA -MPOI locations . Risks for non -threshold substances were assessed based on the incremental contribution of the project. Thus, the potential cumulative ILCR were assessed based on exposure to Project emissions only. As described in IR HC -R2-11 (Addendum 8 , Part B, CI AR #89 ), following review, a refinement of the multimedia model input assumptions and parameters for background exposure was conducted. An HQ of 0.2 was used as a screening level benchmark. Predicted HQs (threshold compounds) for t he most sensitive receptor age group (toddler) and ILCRs (carcinogens) for a composite lifetime receptor are summarized in Table 7-1 (EPL), Table 7-2 (Blairmore Creek ), Table and Table 7-4 (Oldman Reservoir).

Results presented in Table s 7-1 through 7-4 are summarized as follows: Apart from cobalt in the EPL none of the assessed COPCs under any of the Project case scenarios exceeded a target HQ of 1.0. None of the carcinogenic COPCs under any of the Project case scenarios exceeded a target ILCR of 1 in 100,000 (1.E -05). A number of COPCs exceeded the target HQ of 0.2 under the Project case at the EPL which COPCs exceeded the target HQ of 0.2 under the Project case at Blairmore Creek which included: Antimony; Methylmercury; Selenium; and Thallium. Limited Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 21 14-00201-00 Apart from selenium t he Project does not contribut e to any COPCs exceeding a target HQ of 0.2 at Gold Creek; Several COPCs exceeded a target HQ of 0.2 (antimony, barium, copper, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, vanadium and zinc) and a target HQ of 1.0 (aluminum, cadmium, cobalt, lead, manganese and thallium ) under the Application case at a variety of locations . These results are often the cause of naturally elevated concentrations in the back ground vegetation and soil and are consistent with those results originally reported in the Grassy Mountain Coal Proje ct Environmental Impact Assessment Updated Human Health and Wildlife Screening Risk Assessment (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.9-1, CIAR #251). It should be noted that Baseline, Project, and Application cases included predicted exposures estimated for three exposure pathways: inhalation (air, soil); ingestion (soil , surface water, fish, wild game, vegetation); dermal (swimming). Therefore, Benga c onsiders that a comparison with an HQ of 0.2 is overly conservative. In addition, as stated in HHRA guidance (AHW 2011; Health Canada 2010a), an HQ greater than 1.0 is not necessarily an indication of potential risk and additional assessment of the assumptions built into the HHRA is required to determine whether potential risk of adverse health effects is indicated. A review of the risk results presented in Tables 7 -1 through 7-4 was conducted for all COPCs which exceeded a target HQ of 0.2 to determine whether the predicted HQ indicate a risk of potential adverse health effects; a discussion of each is presented below. 7.2.1.1 Aluminum Aluminum is a common element that makes up about 8% of the earth's crust, is typically found in soil at concentrations of 1 -30% a nd has relatively low toxicity to humans ( Krewski et al. 2007). The TRV developed for aluminum is not based on a human health effect study; rather, it is based on several different animal dietary studies with an uncertainty factor applied (WHO 2007). It was further noted that a lower bioavailability of aluminum compounds in food items likely exists as compared to the reviewed dietary studies. There is no AEP (2019) guideline for aluminum concentration in soil and there is \" no consistent, convincing evidence that aluminum in drinking water causes adverse health effects in humans \" (Health Canada 2019). Due to low inherent toxicity and the fact that measured concentrations are consistent with what would be expected to naturally occur in background; aluminum is not considered to be a human health concern for the Project . Benga Mining Limited Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 22 14-00201-00 7.2.1.2 Antimony Antimony HQ results were predicted to be greater than 0.2 but less than 1.0 for both Project and Application cases for both the EPL and Blairmore Creek and greater than 0.2 but less than 1.0 for only the Application case at both Gold Creek and the Oldman Reservoir . The drink ing water quality guideline for the protection of human health is set at 0.006 mg/L (Health Canada 2019) . Predicted Application case surface water concentrations were highest at the EPL (0.003 mg/L), followed by Blairmore Creek (0.001 mg/L) Gold Creek and the Oldman Reservoir (<0.001 mg/L). Therefore, as predicted surface water concentrations are below Canadian drinking water quality guidelines exposure to antimony through drinking water is not considered to be a human health concern for the Site. Predicted HQ results are driven primarily through background exposure estimates which are considered an artifact of the conservatism built into the human health exposure model (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.9-1, CIAR #251). As no HQ greater than 1.0 was predicted, antimony is not considered a human health concern. 7.2.1.3 Barium, Cadmium, Copper, Lead, Manganese, Thallium and Zinc For each of these chemicals the predicted HQ values for the Application case scenario are as a result of background measured concentrations . In all cases Project case contribution predictions were less than 0.2 and the additional consideration of groundwater contribution to the human health risk model has had no material effect on the conclusions of the u pdated HHRA provided in Addendum 10, Appendix 4.9-1, CIAR #251. A more detailed risk discussion with respect to background concentrations and their low likelihood for adverse effect is provided for these metals within the Grassy Mountain Coal Project Environmental Impact Assessment Updated Human Health and Wildlife Screening Risk Assessment (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.9-1, CIAR #251) report. 7.2.1.4 Cobalt Cobalt concentrations were predicted to exceed a target HQ of 1.0 at the EPL. At all other locations (Blairmore C reek, Gold Creek and the Oldman Reservoir) predicted HQ values were less than 1.0 and driven by background. As a result, the discussion presented herein focuses on consideration of the EPL. Cobalt is not considered a human health risk at Blairmore Creek, Gold Creek or the Oldman Reservoir. There are no soil or groundwater quality guidelines available in relation to adverse effects on human heath at either the Provincial or Federal level . The to xicological reference value (TRV) used in the HHRA is based on as single study in which cardiomyopathy was noted during an 8 -month exposure study via the consumption of cobalt beer (Vermeire et al. 1991) . The study notes that simultaneous consumption of a lcohol may have enhanced cardiac effect and confidence in the TR V is low . The Benga Mining Limited Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 23 14-00201-00 study reported a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.0014 mg/kg bw/day and within the EPL the calculated Application case exposure was modeled to be 0.0002 mg/kg bw/day. Provided the low level of confidence in the study and the fact that the reported TDI is 7.6 times higher than the modelled dose assuming a person was to consume all their daily drinking water from the EPL over an extended period (chronic exposure) , cobalt is not considered a human health risk. 7.2.1.5 Methylmercury Methylmercury (MeHg) is not a COPC identified in the Project air emissions; however, elemental mercury was identified as a COPC due to its occurrence in soils and rock and therefore road and blasting dust was identified as a potential source of elemental mercury . In addition, MeHg was also predicted to occur as a result of surficial run -off and groundwater contribution. An estimate of potential risk of adverse human health effects associated with exposure to MeHg via dietary exposure was conducted. The results of this assessment indicated that potential exposure to MeHg via consumption of fish does not pose a risk of adverse health effects. Details of the methods and assumption applied in the MeHg assessment are provided below. Methylmercury concentrations are higher in large-bodied, longer-living animals; those at the top of the food chain like predatory fish. Methylmercury is produced primarily under anaerobic conditions, methylated mostly by anaerobic bacteria, particularly sulfate reducers and methanogens in aquatic sediments (Environment and Climate Change Canada 2017). Therefore, the anaerobic conditions of lake sediments, rather than rivers, streams or creeks, have a higher potential for MeHg formation. To conservatively estimate the potential upper boundary of MeHg that may bioaccumulate in fish, a review of available lake conversion or translation factors for total to MeHg, along with bioaccumulation factors (BAF) for predatory fish relevant to human consumption from regulatory agencies were completed. Due to the complexities in food chain modelling for mercury, methylmercury in fish has been reported to be more accurately estimated from dissolved methyl -mercury concentrations via a bioaccumulation factor (US EPA 2001 and 2009; RIVM 2015). The US EPA has published a translation factor which can be used to estimate the proportion of dissolved MeHg from total mercury in surface water (US EPA, 2001, 2009). Published translation factors are available for rivers, estuaries and lakes. The translation factor of 0.032 (diss olved MeHg/total Hg) for lakes was applied herein . The national BAF designed to estimate the central tendency of the concentrations of mercury in fish of a given trophic level from an average concentration from the US EPA (2001) was applied to estimate bioaccumulation in fish; a value of 2,670,000 was applied. Benga Mining Limited Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 24 14-00201-00 Health Canada has published a tolerable daily intake (TDI) for MeHg of 0.47 \u00b5g/mg -bw/d for the general adult population and 0.2 \u00b5g/ mg-bw/d for women of child -bearing age and children <12 years old (H ealth Canada 2010c; Health Canada 2007). The TDI of 0.2 \u00b5g/mg -bw/d was applied herein for all age groups. Except for Blairmore Creek all remaining HQs were below 0.2 and no locations reported an HQ greater than 1.0 . Multiple levels of conservatism were applied in this this assessment, these include: The application of the translation factor for lakes, which is higher relative to aerobic systems like rivers and creeks, assumes that fish are exposed only to lake water. Blairmore Creek is characterized as a low order stream. The use of the maximum available BAF of 2,670,000 assumes that all fish consumed are fromtrophic level four (food chain apex), while in reality fish from both trophic level three and fourare reported as traditional food items (Chan et al. 2016). The additive contribution of the maximum predicted air concentrations from within the RSA -MPOI is a highly conservative assumption . Given the conservatism built into the evaluation of methylmercury in combination with a derived HQ result that is below 1.0, methylmercury is not considered to be a human health concern. 7.2.1.6 Molybdenum Molybdenum is an essential dietary nutrient which is a constituent of several mammalian enzymes. The TRV selected for use in the current HHRA is based on the results of a 6-year to lifetime dietary exposure study correlated to the dietary intake of molybdenum with serum uric acid levels from the US EPA (1993) . Based on the results of the study, a molybd enum intake of 0.14 mg/kg bw/day could result in serum uric acid levels elevated above the average range of the adult population; this level was designated as a LOAE L. Confidence in the value is considered high and the final chronic oral value applied wit hin the HHRA was 0.005 mg/kg bw/day based on a cumulative uncertainty f actor (UF) of 30 (3-fold reduction for protection of sensitive individuals and a 10 -fold reduction for the use of a LOAEL). Predicted total daily exposure for the toddler was estimated at 0.002 mg/kg bw/day under the application -case scenario . This value is below the TRV established by the US EPA and well below that of the less-conservative tolerable daily intake (TDI) value published by Health Canada ( 2010c ) of 0.023 mg/kg bw/day for a ges 0 to 11 years. Had the less conservative value published by Health Canada been selected the resultant a pplication -case HQ within the EPL (the area of highest predicted human exposure) would have been calculated as 0.09 which is well below the target H Q value of 0.2 . Therefore, molybdenum concentrations predicted within the HHRA are not considered to pose a human health concern. Benga Mining Limited Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 25 14-00201-00 7.2.1.7 Nickel Metallic nickel and nickel alloys are considered possible human carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC ) (Group 2B) and as reasonably expected to be human carcinogens by the National Toxicology Program (NTP ) (Group R). However, no defensible slope factors are available for nickel exposure via ingestion and consistent with Health Canada (2010c) nickel i s treated as a non -carcinogen through oral exposure (ingestion). Nickel concentrations were predicted to exceed a target HQ of 0.2 within the EPL for both the project and application case scenarios but did not exceed an HQ of 1.0 . Exposure wa s as a result of direct ingestion ( chronic ingestion of the EPL water) and mode lled human exposure for the project and application case were calculated as 0.005 1 and 0.0052 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. In comparison, the current Health Canada (2010c) TDI f or nickel (which includes water -soluble forms [nickel su lphate and nickel chloride] as well as more stable forms such as nickel -bearing sulphide minerals and nickel oxide) is 0.011 mg/kg bw/day. Food containing nickel is the major source of exposure in th e general population and the average perso n ingests appr oximately 0.17 mg/day (Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry [ATSDR] 2005) . The equivalent daily dose for a toddler, assuming an exposure of 0.17 mg /day and an average body weight of 16.5 kg is 0.010 mg/kg . This is well aligned with the Canadian Environmental Protection Agency (CEPA) \" Priority Substances List Assessment Report for Nickel and its Compounds \" report which cited food as the major source of exposure for the general population with an average person aged between 0.5 to 4.0 years having an estimated intake of 0.016 mg/kg bw/day (CEPA 1994). Although no water quality guideline currently exists for comparison within Canada, the World Health Organization (WHO) provides a drinking -water quality guideline for nickel of 0.07 mg/L (WHO 2005) . This guideline, which is based on consideration of individuals who had been exposed to drinking water containing nickel on an empty stomac h, accounts for consideration that only 20% of the daily int ake be apportioned to drinking water . Predicted concentrati ons within the EPL are anticipated at 0.14 mg/L which is twice that of the WHO (2005) guideline. Risk results presented within the HHRA included consideration that 100% of a person s daily drinkin g water consumption is obtained from the EPL over a duration of chronic -exposure , a highly conservative assumption . Therefore, while the potential for risk due to drinking water contained within the EPL was model ed, the predictive risk is based largely on a person's cumulative exposure to nickel through diet (food and water). As the EPL concentrations are not based on measured values, but rather a modeled worst-case scenario, the results indicated herein are supportive of further consideration to be taken with respect to the management of the EPL at time of creation (end of mine life) when actual surface water concentrations (data) and meaningful dietary contribution s can be Benga Mining Limited Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 26 14-00201-00 ascertained . Risk results as presented within this section are an indication that additional consideration should be taken to assure protection of human health, not that adverse human health effect will occur as a result of exposure to water in the EPL. 7.2.1.8 Selenium Selen ium HQ results exceeded a target HQ of 0.2 but remained below an HQ of 1.0 at all locations. Except for the EPL, HQ results are driven by the fish ingestion pathway due to predicted fish tissue concentrations. The maximum acceptable concentration (MAC) for selenium in drinking water is 0.05 mg/L and is based on \" chronic sel enosis symptoms, such as hair loss, nail anomalies or loss, skin anomalies and garlic odour of the breath \" (Health Canada 2014) . At the EPL, the predicted surface water concentration is 0.03 mg/L. Provided that the EPL meets the current drinking water quality guidelines presented by Health Canada, and given that the multimedia model predicts an HQ of less than 1.0, selenium is not considered a human health concern at the EPL, in the event fish become present. At all other study locations human exposure predictions are driven by predicted concentration of selenium in fish tissue. Trophic transfer mechanisms are complex and are highly dependent upon the ameliorating affect of sulphate with in the system. Detailed information with respect to the various levels of conservatism built into predicting fish tissue concentrations is provided JRP IR-6.28. Predicted surface water concentrations at Blairmore Creek (Figure 6.25-4 ), Gold Creek (Figure 6.25-5 ), and the Oldman Reservoir (Figure 6.26-7 ) are all over a n order of magnitude lower than the drinking water quality guideline . Based on the various levels of conservatism built within the fish tissue prediction model, the fact that surface water concentrations are well below drinking water criteria and given th e fact that predicted HQ results are less than 1.0 in the multimedia model, selenium is not considered a human health risk. 7.2.1.9 Vanadium Vanadium HQ results exceeded a target HQ of 0.2 but r emained below an HQ of 1.0 at all locations . Except for the EPL, appl ication -case HQ results were driven entirely by measured background concentrations in soil. Vanadium is not considered a human health risk at Blairmore Creek, Gold Creek or the Oldman Re servoir. The vanadium project -case HQ result is a consequence of the assumption that a person will obtain 100% of their daily drinking water from the EPL, a highly conservative assumption . Presently, there is no Canadian drinking water quality guideline to compare the predicted surface water concentration within the EPL; t herefore, the search was extended internationally. The Italian Ministry of Health has proposed a parametric value of 0.14 mg/L (Directive 98/83/EC) , derived from a chronic Benga Mining Limited Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 27 14-00201-00 toxicity study i n rats receiving sodium metavanadate drinking water over a lifetime of exposure (Boscolo et al. 1994) . This concentration is considered as the limit set for the total presence of vanadium in water intended for human consumption without adverse effect and includes in its derivation an anticipation for alternative exposure routes ( vanadium exposure through food ) (Crebelli and Leopardi 2012) . The guideline value is therefore considered a suitable comparison within the HHRA . As the concentration of vanadium within the EPL (0.016 mg/L) is nearly an order of magnitude lower than the Italian Ministry of Health drinking water quality guideline vanadium concentration within the EPL are not considered a human health concern. 7.3 Additive Risk Results for Multiple Contaminant Exposure (Mixtures) Chemicals that have similar effects on the same target organs were assumed to have additive toxicity (i.e., the toxic effects are combined) . The results of the additive toxicity assessment to multiple contaminant ex posures are provided below in Table 7-5 (EPL), Table 7-6 (Blairmore Creek), Table 7-7 (Gold 7-8 Reservoir).

Table 7-8 Predicted Additive Hazard Quotients and ILCR Results by Toxicity Groups for Multimedia Exposures (Oral and Dermal )1 - Oldman Reservoir Toxicity Endpoint groundwater, surface water and food ingestion as possible sources of exposure. Results presented in Table s 7-5 through 7-8 include exposure to COPCs occurring in surface water as well as COPC deposited from air onto water . Baseline results also included exposure to measured vegetation and soil concentrations . A summary is as follows: No additive HQ result s for the Project were greater than 1.0 and no ILCR results exceeded a value of 1 in 100,000 (1.0E -05). Application -case exceedances were driven almost entirely as a result of the Baseline case and therefore were driven by background concentrations thro ugh oral (multimedia) exposure. This is in alignment with the results as previously discussed in the Grassy Mountain Coal Project Environmental Impact Assessment Updated Human Health and Wildlife Screening Risk Assessment (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.9-1, CIAR #251) report . Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 29 14-00201-00 7.4 Chronic Multiple Exposure (Inhalation & Ingestion) Cumulative Risk Results The combined HQ results for multimedia (oral and dermal) and chronic inhalation exposure routes which have a similar critical effects pathway s (liver and kidney) are provided below in Table 7-9 (EPL), Table 7-10 (Blairmore Creek), Table 7-11 (Gold Creek) and Table 7-12 (Oldman Reservoir).

Typically, these uncertainties are addressed using conservative assumptions to ensure that predictions are protective of human health. Specific sources of uncertainty for the present assessment include: Concentrations of chemicals in ambient air can be highly variable. To address this, worst-caseconcentrations were used to assess human health risks. Risk quotients were calculated basedon the MPOI, while exposure is more likely to occur at specific receptor locations, resulting ina lik ely over -prediction of risks . This applies specifically in the additive risk and chronic multiple exposure risk scenarios (Section s 7.3 and 7.4). The existing sources within the study area (EIA, Section E.1.2, CI AR #42 ) likely contribute to baseline exposures of COPCs but there is uncertainty in the magnitude of this contribution; therefore, rather than assessing the incremental contribution of the Project to risks for non - threshold substances, the combined baseline and Project exposures were assessed against incremental exposure limits. Indigenous populations may harvest country foods (local vegetation and wildlife) fromlocations other than where they live. Most Indigenous groups live on reserve and in urbancenters outside of the Crowsnest Pass; however, for the HHRA , this receptor type was assumed to live at all the HHRA receptor locations, harvesting foods from the highest predicted concentration areas, and therefore result s in a highly conservative estimate of chronic exposure. Toxic interactions between chemicals are generally poorly known. This was addressed by assuming additive interactions between chemicals producing similar effects on the sameorgans. Organic chemicals may be metabolized by plants and animals; however, the extent ofmetaboli zation is often uncertain. As a result, metabolization was not generally accounted for, resulting in likely over -prediction of COPC concentrations in plants and animals.Benga Mining Limited Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 31 14-00201-00 Additional conser vative assumptions were made in order to avoid under predicting potential exposure and risk to human receptors, including: assuming COPC concentrations would persist for 80 years; chronic exposure was assumed to occur 7 days per week, 365 days per year; no transformation processes which would reduce exposure potentials for metals or organic COPCs in soil were assumed conversely enrichment factors were applied; COPCs were all assumed to be fully bioavailable in food; all food eaten by receptors was assumed to be derived from the study area, with wild game spending their entire lifespan within the study area; and dermal exposure was assumed to occur year -round. A large body of relevant literature has been published regarding selenium transport throughthe trophic systems. For the current assessment maximum bioconcentration and trophic transfer values were applied. Input data for HHRA includes predicted concentrations of COPC in air, soil and water eachfrom their relative discipline assessment. The models used to predict COPC concentrations in these media also include numerous conservative assumptions which impact the result of the HHRA. Overall, the risk assessment is believed to provide a conservative estimate of potential human health risks, and likely over -predicts risks for many scenarios. 9.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The results of the HHRA demonstrate that emissions from the Project are not predicted to pose a risk of adverse health effects at the receptor locations accessible to the general public (Blairmo re Creek, Gold Creek, Oldman reservoir) . While risk quotients greater than 1.0 were predicted, they were identified to be within the margins of safety considered within the HHRA and in most cases relate to naturally elevated concentration measured in background. Due to the conservative assumptions applied in the air dispersion modelling , groundwater and surface water transport modelling and within the HHRA itself , the risk results presented for the Blairmore Creek, Gold Creek and the Oldman Reservoir were not considered to be indicative of a potential risk of adverse human health effects. While not independently assessed, consideration of the Crowsnest River was addressed as surface water concentrations would be lower than those predicted at Blairmore Creek . Therefore, consideration of the potential for human health risk wi thin Blairmore Creek is inherently protective of Benga Mining Limited Grassy Mountain Coal Project HHRA - Addendum 1, February 2020 Page 32 14-00201-00 the Crowsnest River and likewise the project is not considered to pose a potential of adverse human health effects within the Crowsnest River. Predicted risks for the EPL were within acceptable limits in most cases; however, HQs associated with the Project's contributions from end pit high walls to surface water were a substantial contributor to the application HQ results. Given consideration of the apportionment to drinking water of 20% and the margins of safety built into the HHRA (assumptions that 100% of a person drinking water is obtained from the EPL) the results of the HHRA are not considered indicative of a human health concern . However, management considerations of the EPL are warranted and actual measured concentrations at the time of EPL creation should be used to revisit the HHRA assessment. Air quality monitoring (as described in CR #1a, Section 6.6, C IAR #42 ; and Addendum 10, Appendix 1.3-1: Draft Air Quality Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan, CIAR #251) should be undertaken to validate the predicted air concentrations and confirm the conclusion that Project emissions do not pose any risk of adverse health effect. Surface water concentrations within the EPL should be assessed and monitored as a component of the mine closure strategy to assure measured concentrations are not of human health concern. 10.0 LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND CLOSURE This report has been prepared for Benga Mining Ltd. and pertains solely to the Grassy Mountain Coal Project .

The following provides an addendum to the wildlife screen risk assessment (WRA) to provide additional information associated with aquatic -related wildlife receptors. This addendum provides the following: 2.0 2.1 screening of all wildlife health COPC via water-bas ed pathways for the tendency to bioaccumulate in lotic and lentic aquatic systems including Blairmore Creek, Gold Creek, mine facilities such as sedimentation ponds, the planned end pit lake for the post-clo sure period, and the Oldman Reservoir. Selenium has been included as a COPC; the consideration of selenium loadings to the Oldman Reservoir and subsequent uptake into aquatic organisms in the Oldman Reservoir and provide a rationale for any screening-out of other COPC; the inclusion of receptors which have diets comprised in whole or in part of aquatic-bas ed prey; the inclusion of the ingestion of fish and ingestion of prey which are water-bas ed (such as aquatic invertebrates) in the calculation of hazard quotients for COPC which accumulate in aquatic food chains, including, but not limited to, selenium; Exposure Ratios for the representative receptors with an accompanying risk characterization narrative (including an uncertainty analysis); and a multi-med ia exposure risk characterization for representative receptors. CHEMICALS OF POTENTIAL CONCERN Bioaccumulation Screening Screenin g for potential multimedia exposure was conducted in the Grassy Mountain Coal Project Environmental Impact Assessment Updated Human Health and Wildlife Screening Risk Assessment (Addendum previously completed WRA included assessment of all chemicals of potential concern (COPCs) from direct and indirect exposure to air emissions for potential to bioaccumulate in plant or animal tissue. Benga Mining Limited Wildlife Risk Management - Addendum 1 February 2020 Page 2 14-00201 Any COPCs that met one of the following criteria were identified as having the potential to bioaccumulate in the previous assessment: Molecular weight partition c oefficient (log Kow) >3.5 (indicating a potential to bioaccumulate). From the previously completed WRA, the list of COPCs with the potential to bioaccumulate included: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) ; formaldehyde ; and all metals. The contribution of these compounds via air deposition to aquatic habitats was previously evaluated as part of the initial wildlife risk assessment (Addendum noted above the potential to bioaccumulate in terrestrial receptors. For this addendum to the WRA, a review of the organic carbon partition coefficient (Koc) was conducted for each PAH to evaluate the potential for chemical transport via groundwater mediated pathways. The Koc is the ratio of a chemical's concentration adsorbed per unit mass of soil, to its concentration in water and gives an indication of the aqueous mobility of a substance. A high value means the compound is strongly adsorbed to soil/ organic matter and would not be of concern for groundwater mediated pathways . PAH in the assessment have Koc values ranging from 5,263 - 1,584,893 (CCME, 2008) indicating these compounds have very high affinities for soil and would not be transported significantly via groundwater; as such they have not been considered further. The supporting documentation for the Canadian Drinking Water Quality Guidelines states the following, \" Formaldehyde biodegrades rapidly in water, and since it can be readily degraded by bacteria in the soil, bioaccumulation does not occur\" (Federal -Provincial- Territorial Committee on Drinking Water, 1997) . As such, formaldehyde was screened out and only metals were considered further. Canada's persistence and bioaccum ulation regulations ( Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999; registration 2000- 03-23) were applied to enable bioaccumulation screening. This guidance states: A substance is bioaccumulative (a) when its bioaccumulation factor is equal to or greater than 5 ,000; Benga Mining Limited Wildlife Risk Management - Addendum 1 February 2020 Page 3 14-00201 (b) if its bioaccumulation factor cannot be determined in accordance with a method referred to in section 5 ( generally recognised methods of the Organization for Economic Co -operation and Development or scientific community ), when its bioconcentration factor is equal to or greater than 5,000; (c) if neither its bioaccumulation factor nor its bioconcentration factor can be determined in accordance with a method referred to in section 5, when the logarithm of its octanol -water partition coefficient is equal to or greater than 5. Published bioconcentration factors for all metals were compiled and presented in Table 2-1. Preference was given to bioconcentration factors published by regulatory agencies, followed by primary scientific literature. Compounds determined to be bioaccumulative and carried for further assessment included: silver, mercury, phosphorus, potassium, lead and thallium.

Surface water screening was conducted for the p roposed water management features, which included the End Pit Lake (EPL) (at closure) , North East Sedimentation Pond (NESP), East Sedimentation Pond (ESP), as well as Blairmore Creek, Gold Creek, and the Oldman Reservoir . Risks for the proposed mine water management features (EPL, NESP, ESP) were as sessed based on the proposed plan for these habitats to remain post-closure and it was assumed that risks to wildlife in other aquatic habitats during operations would be addressed through monitoring, and if necessary, operational exposure controls, therefore they are not evaluated further herein. Contribution of deposition of COPC from air were included in this addendum with the methods for their calculation was provided in WRA (Addendum 10, JRP IR -4.9, Wildlife Risk Addendum 1 February 2020 Page 6 14-00201 CIAR#251) . With the exception of selenium at Gold Creek, the COPC contribution from air was assumed to be equal to the concentrations predicted at the maximum point of impingement (MPOI) . For selenium at Gold Creek, the air contributions were assumed to be equal to the deposition predicted for the human receptor location R12 close to the creek 4.9-1, Figure A.4, CIAR#251). This location is much nearer to Gold Creek and thus provides a more accurate estimate of potential deposition. Monthly predicted total metals concentrations were provided for the assessed habitats noted above as per the updated modeling conducted to support with Addendum 11, JRP IR -6.27 . The 95th percen tile of operations and closure concentrations (beginning in 2043) were applied. Surface water screening of provided operations, closure, application concentrations (maximum) against available surface water screening guidelines protective of freshwater aquatic life was completed . The hierarchy of guideline application began with Environmental Quality Guidelines for Alberta Surface Waters (2018), then Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines, followed by other provincial jurisdictions and lastly the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). The combined loadings from the Project site and background loadings were assumed to flow to the Oldman Reservoir and mix completely with the full volume in the reservoir. I nflows and outflows from the reservoir were estimated based on the synthetic hydrograph developed for a 50-year period for the Oldman Reservoir catchment. The assumed volume of the reservoir (380 Mm3) and background total selenium concentration were adopted from Mitchell (2001). A gain, monthly concentrations were calculated using a simple mass balance approach where influent selenium loads were fully mixed with the reservoir volume.

In some of the habitats evaluated , the selected receptors may not be pr esent; h owever, they are surrogates for a specific feeding guild and are deemed to be appropriate representatives due to their specific diet composition. Risk assessment is an iterative process, and initial receptor selection included herbivorous, piscivorous and insectivorous birds and mammals. If risk was predicted for one of these feeding guilds an omnivorous receptor was subsequently evaluated . Overall selection of aquatic receptors considered dietary composition, contaminant sensitivity, the availability of exposure characteristics, and information requested in the preamble of Addendum 11, JRP IR-6.28. Selected aquatic wildlife receptors applied to all habitats are presented in Table 3-1. Unle ss noted, receptor characteristics for surrogate species were obtained from Environment Canada (2012) and are summarized in Table 3-2.

Benga Mining Limited Wildlife Risk Management - Addendum 1 February 2020 Page 12 14-00201 3.1 Receptor Context & Selection Rationale Northern River Otter (Lontra Canadensis), piscivorous mammal . The river otter is an opportunistic forager that primarily eats fish but will consume other aquatic animals when necessary . River otters can live in freshwater or marine waters and prefer to inhabit the wooded shores of coastlines, lakes, rivers and estuaries . Their home range is highly dependent on available food sources and habitat quality . The river otter was selected as surrogate receptor based on its relative high fish ingestion rate and preference for habitat in the project area. Beaver (Castor canadensis), herbivorous mammal. The beaver is a semi-aquatic herbivorous mammal whose preferred diet includes leaves, bark, twigs, and aquatic plants (Aleksiuk, 1968). Beavers live in forested regions and burrow in the banks of rivers and lakes and build dams and lodges on water courses out of logs, bra nches, and mud. Beavers are mainly nocturnal and are most active from dusk to dawn. Beavers are active all winter and swim and forage in water beneath surface ice. The beaver was selected as a representative receptor for herbivorous aquatic mammals due to their strict herbivore diet, and their preference for the type of habitat found in the project area. Little Brown Bat (Myotis lucifugus), insectivorous mammal . They do not have any contact with submerged sediments, resulting in a diet primarily consisting of insects captured in flight in open forest canopies, open shorelines, basins of water bodies and wetlands (US EPA, 1999a ). Some of their prey spend the first part of their lives in bodies of water, a potential to contaminant exposure. Little brown bats forage along the edges of bodies of waters and vegetated habitats (Crampton and Robert, 1998). Bats inhabiting Canada do not usually migrate, making them year -round residents, hibernating part of the year . The little brown bat was selected as a representative insectivore for its habitat preference and strict insectivore diet. American (Cinclus mesicanus) , year -round resident of freshwater streams. I ts diet is comprised entirely of aquatic -base d food (small fish, fish eggs and benthic macro-invertebrates) . American Dippers seasonally migrate up and downstream within a watershed, impacting their diets. T he migratory dippers will consume a higher number of insects relative to the river resident dippers (Nagy, 1987). T his avian insectivore was chosen as a representative receptor due to their aquatic -based diet composition, preference for habitat in the project area and instruction from the JRP. Mallard Duck (Anas platyrhynchos), omnivorous aquat ic bird . The mallard is an adaptable bird and may nest near lakes, ponds, rivers, woodland pools; however, it prefers natural grasslands that surround sloughs or marshy areas . The mallard is a surface -feeding duck, which consumes insects and larvae, aquatic invertebrates and aquatic vegetation, but also seeds and grains (Palmer, 1976). The mallard was selected as a representative omnivorous bird due to its preference for the type of Benga Mining Limited Wildlife Risk Management - Addendum 1 February 2020 Page 13 14-00201 habitat found in the project area, availability of preferred food sources, and the availability of defensible exposure characteristics. Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias) , piscivorous bird . The diet of the heron consists predominantly of fish, but will eat amphibians, crustaceans, insects, reptiles and mammals (US EPA, 1993) . These migratory birds breed in Canada during the winter and will inhabit themselves along the margins of most freshwater and saltwater bodies (Kushlan, 1978). T he location of their nesting grounds can be generally close to their foraging ground in tall t rees; however, rock ledges or sea cliffs are also common (Palmer, 1962) . This bird was selected as a representative receptor due to their high fish ingestion rate, and habitat preference type. Canada Goose (Branta canadensis), herbivorous bird. This wat erfowl species has an almost exclusive vegetarian diet. T he Canada goose is the most widespread and abundant goose in North America, migrating away from their breeding grounds during late summer and early autumn . The Canada Goose is a versatile bird that breeds in climates ranging from the lake shores and coastal marshes in the arctic tundra through temperate climates (US EPA, 1993). Canada Goose families are predominantly on land but are found close to water . The goose was selected based on a strict pl ant diet, allocated entirely for aquatic plants. 4.0 AQUATIC WILDLIFE EXPOSURE Exposure for all aquatic wildlife included the ingestion of surface water, sediment, aquatic and terrestrial plants, fish, aquatic invertebrates and prey, based on the individual su rrogate receptor characteristics. As previously stated in section 2.2 , exposure was assessed based on the inhalation of COPC by wildlife predicted in air at the maximum-point -of-impingement for mine facilities. Predicted deposition of COPC was added to modelled surface water concentrations to evaluate exposure . With the exception of selenium at Gold Creek, predicted deposition from air was assumed to equal the concentrations predicted at the maximum-point -of-impingement; for Gold Creek concentrations predicted for human receptor location R1 2 were used Chemical concentrations in environmental media (other than surface water) were estimated as part of the human health risk assessment ( from the r egional study area maximu m point of impingement (RSA -MPOI) applied in the human health risk assessment were directly applied. These included concentrations for vegetation such as cattails, and prey tissue for receptors that consume small terrestrial -based mammals. It should be noted that applying the RSA -MPOI concentrations is extremely conservative when evaluating population level endpoints for ecological receptors. Benga Mining Limited Wildlife Risk Management - Addendum 1 February 2020 Page 14 14-00201 The were used to calculate wildlife exposure doses, and have not been presented again: Ingestion of surface water - Equation 16; Ingestion of sediment - Equation 15; Ingestion of terrestrial plant (plants and berries) - Equation 18; Ingestion of fish - Equation 18; and Ingestion of prey - Equation 18. Food ingestion rates were calculated as a fraction of the total food ingestion rates recommended by Environment Canada (2012) based on species dietary composition. Selenium exposure and food -web modelling was unlike al l other COPC. The rationale and calculation of selenium concentrations in periphyton, aquatic invertebrates and fish tissue - along with worked example equations are presented in Appendix B . 5.0 WILDLIFE DAILY THRESHOLD EXPOSURE DOSES Wildlife oral toxicity reference values referred to as daily threshold exposure doses (DTED) published by CCME, ORNL, and US EPA were identified. The methodology of DTED selection, consideration given to endangered species and chemical specific summaries are presented in Appen dix C. Due to the physiological differences between mammals and birds, separate mammalian and avian DTEDs are specified herein. The selected DTED values are summarized below in Table 4-1. Compounds with no available DTED are identified below and were not evaluated further . The lack of available toxicology for these chemicals is generally an indication of their innocuous nature.

NB: This lower value was conservatively applied where available for all receptors. 6.0 AQUATIC WILDLIFE RISK Potential risk to aquatic wildlife receptors was determined by comparing the ratio of predicted total exposure to the DTEDs to a threshold of 1.0 . This ratio is referred to has an exposure ratio, where values above 1.0 indicate the potential for adverse effects . Tables D1 to D 6 in Appendix D provide the exposure ratios for all scenarios and receptors included in the ecological risk assessment. Benga Mining Limited Wildlife Risk Management - Addendum 1 February 2020 Page 16 14-00201 Except for selenium, the calculated exposure ratios for all COPCs, for all surrogate aquatic wildlife species in all habitats evaluated were below 1.0 . Selenium exposure ratios of 1.7 and 3.8 were calculated for the insectivorous and omnivorous birds in the EPL, respectively. A ll other exposure ratios for selenium in other habitats assessed were below 1.0. 7.0 UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT The uptake of selenium in the presence of differing sulphate concentrations was studied in three primary producers. The relationship developed based on the laboratory study was calibrated with measured enrichment in Blairmore Creek. T he derived regression eq uation for Blairmore Creek was also applied to Gold Creek. While this application carries someuncertainty as water chemistry and the primary producer community composition between systems is naturally variable , based on both systems being lotic and conne cted this application was believed to be reasonable. It was assumed that the relationship observed between selenium and sulphate in the studied primary producers would apply to periphyton broadly in the habitats evaluated, which carries uncertainty . This relationship has been documented in regulatory guidance (US EPA, 2016) and a within a body of scientific literature and while small deviations in enric hment may exist between species, the consistency of this documented relationship would suggest this assumption is reasonable. Receptor characteristics for all the bat species listed by the preamble to Addendum 11,JRP IR-6.28 were not available. As per CCME ecological risk assessment guidance, a surrogate receptor was identified based on a compilation of the available receptor characteristics forbats. While this is believed to be appropriate and the best approach given the limited available data, individua l species present in the project area may have different receptors characteristics. The magnitude of these receptor characteristic deviations on predicted risk isuncertain but is not expected to be significant . The EPL, NESP and ESP are assumed to be non-fish bearing with the waterbody itself notbeing accessible by fish. Wildlife exposure from the consumption of fish from these habitats is therefore nil . While the EPL has no connection to fish bearing waters the potential for this habitat to support fi sh is unknown. 8.0 CON SERVATISM AND CONCLUSIONS Ecological risk assessment, and risk assessment in general, is by -design a conservative process which aims to estimate reasonable worst-case exposure for surrogate receptors. As such, predicted risk (exposure ratios) above a threshold of 1.0 does not indicate adverse effect but rather the potential for Benga Mining Limited Wildlife Risk Management - Addendum 1 February 2020 Page 17 14-00201 adverse effect at the population level under reasonable worst-case exposure. Major elements of conservatism included in the current assessment includ e: the appli cation of modelled surface water \"upper-case\" source terms rather than \"best- estimate\" were applied to derive modelled numbers; the 95th percentile of modelled surface water concentrations for operations and closure were applied and the application case evaluated considered the maximum of both ; and aquatic wildlife receptors were assumed to obtain 100% of food sources from the habitat evaluated , meaning no consideration of home range or migration factor w ere applied . Conclusions: The potential for r isk from exposure to selenium is predicted in the EPL (at closure) for insectivorous and omnivorous birds, driven by the ingestion of invertebrates. T he results indicate the potential for adverse effect under the predicted upper bounds of exposure . Based on this , management considerations of the EPL are warranted and actual measured concentrations at the time of EPL creation should be used to revisit this model prediction. Risk from other evaluated COPC was not predicted for aquatic wildlife in all other habitats evaluated (NESP, ESP, Blairmore Creek, Gold Creek, and the Oldman Reservoir) .Benga Mining Limited Wildlife Risk Management - Addendum 1 February 2020 Page 18 14-00201 9.0 REFERENCES Alberta Environment and Parks (AEP). 2019.

The associated worked exposure calculations from environmental media were provided in the updated Human Health and Wildlife Screening Risk A ssessment and are not presented again herein. T he following presents the rationale and basis of the aquatic selenium food web model applied to estimate risk as part of the addendum to the wildlife risk assessment. Selenium is unlike other COPC that bioconcentrate, in that the most consequential step in trophic transfer happens at the base of the food web (US EPA, 2016; BC MOE, 2014). The partitioning of selenium from water into particulates is the most significant step in exposure and termed the 'Enrichment Factor' (EF). P articulates or periphyton in this assessment refers to a complex combination of algae, cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria, and detritus attached to surfaces in aquatic systems; an important food source for higher tropic levels. Guidance from the province of British Columbia (2014) and the US EPA (2016) apply multi -step models including EF and trophic transfer factors that represent successive steps in the food chain to derive water concentrations protective of fish under generic conditions . This guidance recognise s that enrichment factors, and to a lesser extent trophic transfer factors, are inversely related to exposure concentration in a non -linear relationship and that enrichment in lotic or lentic habitat s is distinct . Separate surface water guidelines have been published by the US EPA (2016) for lentic (standing water) or lotic systems. Based on recognized increased enrichment in lentic systems, food web modelling completed herein was distinct for lotic and lentic habitats. The lentic habitats evaluated in the current assessment included the North East Sedimentation Pond (NESP), East Sedimentation Pond (ESP), End Pit Lake, and the Oldman Reservoir . The lotic evaluated Blairmore and Gold Creeks. Water -only exposure studies were considered in the derivation of the fish whole-body guideline from BC, and the US EPA recommends a water column concentration in their translation to fish tissue estimation. Based on this, the contribution of selenium from aerial deposition was added to predicted surface water concentrations provided from SRK. Equations outlining the contribution of aerial deposition to surface water have been previously presented in the Grassy Mountain Coal Project Enviro nmental Impact Assessment Updated Human Health and Wildlife Screening Risk Assessment (Addendum 10, Appendix 4.9-1, CIAR#251) and not discussed herein . The aggregated surface water concentration was applied in food web modelling to estimate aquatic and fish tissue concentrations for the various habitats. P redicted concentrations in periphyton were only used to predict the selenium concentration in aquatic invertebrates and subsequently fish . Grassy Mountain Coal Project Wildlife Risk Assessment - Addendum 1 Appendix B - Selenium Aquatic Food Web Model Page B-2 14-00201 Lotic Habitat Selenium Food Web Modelling Site-specific s eleni um enrichment in the lotic habitat of Blairmore Creek was measured in a laboratory study using water from Blairmore Creek and including the influence of varying sulphate concentrations on the selenium partitioning into primary producers ( EIA, CR#5, Appendix A1, CIAR#42) . This study and others support the inhibition of selenium uptake at the base of the food chain in the presence of sulphate (US EPA, 2016; DeForest et al., 2017) . Selenium enrichment into primary producers was measured in Blairmore Creek and used to calibrate the regression equation presented in EIA, CR #5, Appendix A1, CIAR #42 . The process for the been previously presented in Addendum 8, Appendix C-3, Windward Risk Assessment. T his calibrated equation , presented below as Equation A. 1, was used to estimate the concentration in periphyton in the flowing habitats of Blairmore and Gold Creeks. ln( )= 0. (mg/kg dry weight ) particulate material or periphyton in flowing lotic habitats CSW-Se = selenium concentration in surface water ( \u00b5g/L) CSW-SO4 = sulphate concentration in surface water (mg/L) The next step in the aquatic food web is the calculation of selenium concentration in aquatic macro invertebrates from periphyton . Existing non -site-specific regression models for this calculation were reviewed. The regression model developed by Golder (2014) which is based on co -located selenium data for aquatic macroinvertebrates and their food (periphyton) in the Elk Valley watershed was selected. This regression model was selected based on its higher predicted concentration in aquatic macroinvertebrates relative to other models reviewed and relatively close proximity to the project area with likely similar invertebrate community composition . Equatio n A.2 below was used to predict the concentration in aquatic macroinvertebrates =10(0.456\u00d7+0.658) Equation selenium ) material or periphyton in flowing lotic habitats -lotic in invertebrates of lotic habitats (mg/kg dry weight) Grassy Mountain Coal Project Wildlife Risk Assessment - Addendum 1 Appendix B - Selenium Aquatic Food Web Model Page B-3 14-00201 The last step in the selenium aquatic food web model predicts the concentration in fish tissue (whole- body dry weight ) that wildlife would consume . The US EPA (2016) has the most comprehensive data set with respect to trophic transfer into fish, defined as a trophic transfer factor (TTF Fish). The range of TTF Fish is 0.68 (channel catfish) to 2.67 (black crappie) - both of these noted species are not present in watersheds evaluated ; however, to account for interspecies variability in trophic transfer, the upper 80th percentile of all 32 published TTF fish values was applied (1.48) . This value is believed to be higher than 'typical' fish trophic transfer for species in the evaluated watershed, for example the published TTF fish for the cutthroat trout is 1.12 . This conservative selection is aligned with the objectives of an ecological risk assessment, which is to evaluate risk to receptors considering reasonable worst-case exposure . The selenium concentration in whole- body fish tissue was calculated using Equation A. 3. = \u00d7 Equation A.3 Where: dry CFish = selenium concentration in whole-body fish tissue (mg/kg dry weight). Lentic Habitat Selenium Food Web Modelling To a ccount for the higher trophic transfer into periphyton in lentic habitats a different approach was taken. A n enrichment factor specific to lentic habitats appropriate for lakes, ponds and reservoirs of 900 L/kg particulate material was applied based on a review of 96 aquatic sites derived from published studies (US EPA, 2016, Figure 3.6) (Equation A.4). _=\u00d7 Equation A.4 Where: Cperiphyton_lentic lentic habitats. EF Lentic = enrichment factor, 900 L/kg applied to lentic habitats (post -closure pit lake, sedimentation ponds, Oldman Reservoir). = selenium c oncentration in surface water (mg/L) . To account for uncertainties in food chain modelling the US EPA has published a single trophic transfer value that accounts for all dietary pathways into fish; this value is conceptually similar to a bioaccumulation factor and accounts for e cosystems with different consumer species and is meant to eliminate uncertainty in food web modelling (US EPA, 2016) . Taxon specific values of composite trophic transfer range from 1.2 (western mosquito fish) to 4.02 (northern pike, n=1 study) were identi fied; the 80 th percentile of all 65 published values was 2.87. To account for the necessary Grassy Mountain Coal Project Wildlife Risk Assessment - Addendum 1 Appendix B - Selenium Aquatic Food Web Model Page B-4 14-00201 conservatism required to estimate a reasonable worst-case exposure in a two-step food model, a 95th percentile value of 3.0 was applied for TTF Composite. A.5). = \u00d7 Equation A.5 in lentic habitats. TTF Composite = trophic transfer representing the product of all trophic transfer factors from periphyton through trophic level 4 of predatory fish (unitless). CFish = selenium c oncentration in whole fish tissue (mg/ kg dry weight ). While the two -step model presented above was applied to estimate fish tissue concentration, the concentration of selenium in aquatic macroinvertebrates in lentic systems was also required. A separate calculation using the estimated selenium concentration in periphyton was used to derive a concentration in invertebrate tissue, relevant for other consumers of invertebrates, including birds and mammals . The US EPA (2016) has derived trophic transfer factors (TTF) for freshwater aquatic invertebrates. Aquatic invertebrate TTFs have been publish ed ranging from 0.74 for Daphnia magna and fluminea ). The airborne consumption of aquatic invertebrates is an important consideration for bird receptors and bats. As such, the representative invertebrate TTF should ideally be relevant to wildlife invertebrate consumers in and out of the water column. Other reviews for invertebrate uptake have published 75th quartile values of 2.1 for TTF Invertebrates (Deforest, 2017), which is aligned with the upper bounds published values from the US EPA and other field validated trophic transfer for invertebrates (Presser and Luoma, 2010) and A.6 trophic CInvertebrate = concentration in invertebrate tissue (mg/ kg dry weight).

The following resources were reviewed, listed in order of preference: US EPA: ECOTOX Database; US Department of Energy; Risk Assessment Informa tion System; California EPA: CalEcotox Database (all birds US Geological Survey: Wildlife and Contaminants Online; CCME: Canadian Tissue Residue Guidelines for the Protection of Wildlife Consumers of Aquatic Biota; CCME: A Protocol for the D erivation of Environmental and Human Health Soil Quality Guidelines (2006); and Google Scholar for relevant journal articles . Wildlife toxicity reference values published by various regulatory agencies are summarized below. The general approaches taken by these agencies include: Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) - Values used by CCME to develop soil quality guidelines are the LOAEL for the species determined to be most at thr eat (based on sensitivity to contaminant and the ratio of ingestion rate to body weight), considering a minimum of two oral mammalian studies and one oral avian study, preferably including a grazing herbivore with a high ingestion rate to body weight ratio . Uncertainty factors between one and five may be applied . Only one DTED is typically specified and used to derive soil quality guidelines, unless the chemical biomagnifies and higher trophic levels are also evaluated (CCME, 2006). CCME - When selecting DTEDS for an ecological risk assessment, population based cr itical endpoints (reproduction and mortality) are given priority. Non -population effects such as growth are not considered appropriate. US Department of Energy, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORN L) - NOAEL and LOAEL values were obtained from studies by OR NL. One avian and one mammal study were identified as critical studies based on endpoints and relevance to wildlife; in some cases NOAELs and LOAELs were extrapolated from available data (Sample et al., 1996) . Based on the methodologies employed, the LOAEL values specified by ORNL are expected to have a similar level of protection to the CCME values. Grassy Mountain Coal Project Wildlife Risk Assessment - Addendum 1 Appendix C - Wildlife Daily Threshold Exposure Doses (DTED) Page C-2 14-00201 US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) - a large number of studies were reviewed by US EPA t o develop ecological soil screening levels. The toxicity benchmark was set as the lower of the geometric mean of growth and reproduction NOAEL values, or the highest bounded NOAEL that is less than the lowest bounded LOAEL (US EPA, 2003) . The US EPA values are generally more conservative than the CCME values. In general, values developed or endorsed by Environment Canada, including those published by CCME, are given preference . However, CCME evaluate only the most sensitive receptor for the food ingestio n pathway, and therefore generally only specify either a mammalian DTED or an avian DTED instead of both . Due to the physiological differences between mammals and birds, separate mammalian and avian DTEDs are specified herein where possible. Also, since the reviews undertaken by US EPA and ORNL may incorporate additio nal studies or newer data, values published by other agencies are evaluated even where CCME has specified a value. Each chemical of concern is evaluated on a case -by-case basis below. Threat ened/Endangered Species The level of protection considered to be appropriate for the protection of ecological systems in general may not be sufficiently protective of threatened or endangered species in all cases. If the effect on which the DTED is based is significant (mortality or reproduction effects ), additional conservatism may be required. The US EPA toxicity reference values are expected to be sufficiently protective of threatened and endangered species, since they are set below the level at which any effects are observed in a large database of studies . In the absence of US EPA values, uncertainty factors may be applied on a case -by-case basis as described below. REFERENCES CCME (Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment). 2006 .

Phosphorus is an essential nutrient regulated by mo st organisms and is not expected to be toxic at environmentally relevant exposure levels. Therefore, no DTEDs are established for this substance. Potassium No TRVs for potassium were identified . Potassium is an essential nutrient regulated by most organisms and is not expected to be toxic at environmentally relevant exposure levels. Therefore, no DTEDs are established for this substance. Selenium Avian TRV Source DTED (mg/kg - BW/day) Species Comments CCME 2007 0.3 chickens hatchab ility ORNL (Sample et al. 1996) 1 mallard ducks reproductive effects US EPA (2007) 0.290 chickens mortality (NOAEL) CCME has specified an avian DTED for selenium, and this value is lower than the ORNL value and similar to the US EPA value . The CCME value is therefore applied herein for all bird species. Additional conservatism for threatened/endangered species is not considered warranted due to the very narrow range between the required nutritional dose and toxic dose for this substance, and sinc e the NOAEL-based US EPA value is virtually identical to the CCME value.
