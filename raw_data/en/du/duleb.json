Cleaning out all of those toxins from your body and your life is a fabulous first step but what does that look like and how can you attain this goal safely while still living and breathing in a toxic society? Detox With Lemon Water First off, don't push the panic button and overwhelm yourself, start slow and easy. Drinking warm water with fresh squeezed lemon or lime juice in the morning is a great start: it helps to purify the blood, gently cleanses and stimulates the liver; it liquefies bile and inhibits excess bile flow. It aids digestion, helps bowel elimination, it helps to lower blood pressure, alkalizes the body, helps to dilute uric acid (which can create arthritic pain or gout) and helps to reduce phlegm in the body. Lemons and limes are also a good source of citric acid, potassium, calcium, phosphorous and magnesium. Who would have thought such small fruits could pack such a big punch? And the list goes on... lemons and limes have also been shown to relieve symptoms of asthma, allergies and other respiratory problems, nourish brain and nerve cells (due to the potassium content), they help to dissolves gallstones, calcium deposits, kidney stones, and pancreatic stones and in pregnancy, they will help build strong bones in the child. Cleanse Your Beauty Products Reevaluate your morning routine. Look at the toxic load that you actually have control over; the shampoo, conditioner, hairspray, body lotion, make-up and other beauty products that you may use every single day. There are no limits to the toxins in those products because they are not regulated. There is a great resource from the Environmental Working Group called Skin Deep. It's a database where you can see what's hidden in the products you use and what each chemical does in your body. They also give you ideas about better companies and products you can use instead. http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/. Detox Your Cupboards Clean out your kitchen and throw away foods containing suspicious ingredients, coloring agents, chemical additives, and preservatives (you'll know them when you can't pronounce them). Eat organic whenever possible. Avoid sugar. Too much sugar, especially from processed foods, can do as much damage to the liver as excess alcohol. Eat Local Eat locally and according to season. If it's not in season but you can buy it in the store, chances are it has come from a very long way. That means it's probably been applied with ripening agents to slow down the ripening process and it also means a great amount of gasoline will be burned in the process of transporting the food to your table. In an age where we are all wondering what we can do to be more environmentally friendly, this is a way. Non Toxic Cooking Switch to non-toxic cooking and storage wares. Avoid plastics, non-stick wares, and aluminums when you cook or store foods. Use non-plastic containers, and wrappings, such as ceramics, porcelain, glass, and natural parchment paper to avoid harmful bisphenol A and other hormone disruptors found in plastic. Filter Your Water Use water filters. Two of the most damaging substances, both to overall health and to digestive function found in the water supply are chlorine and fluoride. Detox Your Cleaning Products Go room to room and get rid of toxic household goods and products. Replace them with all-natural, non-toxic alternatives. Make your own cleaning products or purchase environmentally friendly ones. I use vinegar and water for just about everything. Baking soda and vinegar in your sink or toilet does wonders on clogs and a couple of drops of tea tree oil and peppermint in some water to spritz on your bed when you change the sheets will keep dust mites away and refresh your bed. Cleanse The Air With Plants Use plants in your house and office to help filter the air. Spider plants, aloe vera, chrysanthemum, Gerber daisies, fern, ivy, and philodendrons help filter toxins from the air and add oxygen. Full Body Herbal Cleanse Consider a full-body herbal detoxification cleanse to get rid of what's already in your body. There are great kits at your local health food store. Look for one that works on all 7 organs of elimination: liver, lungs, colon, kidneys, skin, blood and lymphatic system. These kits contain natural herbs which stimulate the detoxification processes of these organs. Cleansing a couple of time a year can reduce your toxic load and increase your energy. Just remember to drink more water and eat more fibre or take a fibre supplement to help flush the toxins out as they are being released. Detox Your Life Last but not least, get rid of toxic thoughts and toxic people from your life. Those two things alone can make you sick and tired. If you can't avoid toxic people (you know, the ones who walk into your office, complain incessantly and walk away after they've dumped their negative energy on you), then protect yourself with a transformational cloak of mirrors. It sounds crazy but it works. A friend of mine who is an amazing energy healer taught me this. All you do is imagine that you are putting on a cloak of mirrors that will reflect negativity away from you but only after it has been transformed into unconditional love. Interestingly, once this has been done, the \"attacker\" or \"energy vampire\" as I like to refer to them, seems to get confused and leave by their own volition. It also works great in crowds. I am a strong believer that if you keep the toxins out and give the body what it needs, it will always balance itself. Taking care of your health naturally through a healthy diet, adequate sleep, natural supplementation, positive attitude, exercise and relaxation helps your body to stay strong, vibrant and healthy on its own. If you follow this protocol you will have a healthy immune system, lots of energy, balanced hormones, great moods and a whole host of other health benefits. "}
