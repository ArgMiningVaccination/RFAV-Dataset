If you find yourself frequently coughing during meals, having issues swallowing or notice a difference in the sound or feel of your voice, it's time to schedule an appointment with one of our Penn State Health otolaryngologists. Patients with voice disorders can have affected speech. A majority of voice hoarseness comes from common causes like: - Acid reflux - Inflammation due to infection - Noncancerous (benign) masses - Overuse of the voice Additionally, many people experience a natural vocal change due to using their voices in different environments, like work or home. Dysphagia can be caused by nerve or muscle problems, often following a stroke or cancer treatment. Regardless of your voice issue's cause, the first step is establishing an accurate diagnosis with the aid of the latest imaging and voice analysis technology. Our team works together to evaluate, treat and manage every patient's voice and swallowing disorder. Symptoms, Diagnosis and Outlook Symptoms of voice disorders can include: - Decreased voice projection - Decreased volume - Loss of vocal range - Neck or throat discomfort with the use of your voice - Persistent hoarseness - Voice fatigue Symptoms of dysphagia include: - Difficulty swallowing - Unable to get solid foods or liquids down the esophagus easily - Food or drink going down the windpipe (aspirating), causing a high risk of pneumonia - Coughing during mealtimes Our Penn State Health otolaryngologists will examine both the structure and function of your vocal cords using a stroboscope, a high-definition video endoscope that helps visualize both your vocal cords and their vibrations. Our team will order diagnostic swallowing tests for dysphagia patients to help guide the diagnosis and treatment plan. These tests can include: - Modified barium swallow X-ray series while you are actively swallowing: to determine the location and nature of your swallowing issues - Endoscopy: a small camera passed down the esophagus into the stomach - Manometry: a small tube inserted in the esophagus and connected to a pressure catheter to assess your esophageal muscle strength If you or a loved one is experiencing any voice issues, don't delay in getting treatment. Many people believe it's normal to lose their voice as they age or fear they have throat cancer - but, in many cases, the issue is treatable. Catching an issue like throat cancer in its early stages has a higher cure rate, with an excellent voice outcome. If you are worried something is changing with your voice, don't ignore the warning signs. Schedule an appointment with a Penn State Health otolaryngologist today.
