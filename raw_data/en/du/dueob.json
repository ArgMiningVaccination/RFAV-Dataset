Acupuncture may also be a helpful adjunctive treatment for nausea or vomiting associated with chemotherapy. It is a form of Traditional Chinese Medicine that uses the careful insertion of very fine needles into the body at specific points. Acupuncture is less likely to be effective as a stand-alone therapy, so it is used in the context of comprehensive medical treatment. This might include participation in programs such as physical therapy, the spine clinic, the fibromyalgia group, the online headache program, or the chronic pain management program. A clear medical diagnosis is required before acupuncture treatment begins and a physician referral is needed. It is important for patients to participate concurrently in self-care activities such as independent exercise, self-massage techniques, and stress management. Acupuncture is generally not used as a long-term maintenance therapy. If you are interested in receiving acupuncture, your first step is to contact your doctor. Physicians can refer appropriate patients for acupuncture treatments. Once our department receives the referral, we will call you to book your private acupuncture treatments. Your acupuncturist can answer your questions and will assess the results of your treatments and report to your physician. "}
