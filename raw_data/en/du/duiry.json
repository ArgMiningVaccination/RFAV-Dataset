How Does Mindfulness Help Addiction Recovery? What is Mindfulness? [Mindfulness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/mindfulness) is having the internal focus to be quietly aware of your own thoughts and impulses - without judgment - and without acting on the impulses. How Does Mindfulness Help in Addiction Recovery? Mindfulness is very helpful in [relapse prevention](https://www.newstartrecoverysolutions.com/mindfulness-relapse-prevention/) and [addiction recovery](https://www.newstartrecoverysolutions.com/bay-area-addiction-recovery/). Long-term [addiction recovery](https://www.newstartrecoverysolutions.com/addiction-recovery-personal-growth-positive-changes/) is dependent on discarding habitual behaviors to drink or drug - and engage in new sober activities. How Does Mindfulness Help? A space of awareness is created between impulse and actions with mindfulness practice. With increased non-judgmental self-awareness - impulsive and habitual behaviors can decrease. This means that the effects of triggers can be decreased or eliminated. And impulsive actions are no longer automatically activated.

TriWest in-network; VA Community Care Provider Mindfulness Lifestyle for Wellness Once learned, Mindfulness costs nothing to practice. Mindfulness can be done anywhere, at any time. It requires no setup. Mindfulness can be practiced while sitting, standing, walking, gazing at the ocean - the possibilities are endless. One of the best and cheapest ways to become healthier and happier in general is through mindfulness practice. Mark Williams is a professor of clinical psychology at Oxford; and an expert in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. He is the co-author of [Mindfulness: A Practical Guide to Finding Peace in a Frantic World](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/074995308X/). According to Williams, after nine weeks of training - participants in a mindfulness program had \"an increased sense of purpose and had fewer feelings of isolation and alienation, along with decreased symptoms of illness as diverse as headaches, chest pain, congestion and weakness.\" Benefits of Mindfulness in Addiction Recovery and Relapse Prevention Can learning to practice Mindfulness help individuals in recovery - and in relapse prevention? The answer is YES. According to a practice review published in 2010 by the APA (American Psychological Association), [What Are the Benefits of Mindfulness?](http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/pst-48-2-198.pdf) - the practice of mindfulness has multiple benefits in mood regulation, stress reduction and self awareness.

TriWest in-network; VA Community Care Provider Benefits of Mindfulness in Addiction Treatment and Relapse Prevention Include: - Reduced Pain - A study published in the Journal of Neuroscience March 16, 2016 concluded that Mindfulness meditation reliably reduces pain. ( [Mindfulness-Meditation-Based Pain Relief Is Not Mediated by Endogenous Opioids](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/11/3391.short)) - Reduced Rumination - Several studies have shown that mindfulness reduces obsessive thoughts. - Stress reduction - Many studies show that practicing mindfulness reduces stress. - Boosts to working memory - Improvements to working memory appear to be another benefit of mindfulness. - Focus - Another study examined how mindfulness meditation affected participants' ability to focus attention and suppress distracting information. Mindfulness meditation practice and self-reported mindfulness correlated directly with [cognitive flexibility and attentional functioning](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9c9d/4c2564a4529180dd0574a3f3c2e5ecf9617c.pdf)(Moore and Malinowski, 2009). - Less Emotional Reactivity - Research also supports that mindfulness meditation decreases emotional reactivity. This results in being able to 'catch' habitual reactions before it becomes an action. - More Cognitive Flexibility - Another line of research suggests that in addition to helping people become less reactive, mindfulness meditation may also provide greater cognitive flexibility to avoid habitual behaviors. One study found that people who practice mindfulness meditation develop the skill of self-observation. This neurologically disengages the automatic pathways that were created by prior learning - and enables present-moment input to be integrated in a new way ( [Mindfulness Training and Neural Integration](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2566758/), Siegel, 2007a). - Increased Emotional Resilience - Meditation also activates the brain region associated with more adaptive responses to stressful or negative situations (Cahn & Polich, 2006; Davidson et al., 2003). Activation of this region corresponds with faster recovery to baseline after being provoked ( [Davis and Hayes, What Are the Benefits of Mindfulness](https://www.psicoterapiabilbao.es/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/benefits_of_mindulness_in_psychotherapy.pdf)). - Relationship Satisfaction - Several studies find that a person's ability to be mindful can help predict relationship satisfaction by increasing the ability to respond well to relationship stress and the skill in communicating one's emotions to a partner. - Mindfulness Interrupts the Addiction Cycle.

USC researchers Jordan Davis and Nicholas Barr are testing mindfulness as a component of recovery from substance use, trauma and other serious challenges. Initial studies with young adults show dramatic drops in stress, cravings, impulsivity and risk of relapse after practicing mindfulness. [\"Mindfulness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/mindfulness) based [relapse prevention](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/relapse-prevention) (MBRP) has demonstrated efficacy in alleviating [substance use](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000281771930491X), stress, and [craving](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/craving). Our results suggest that Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention is a useful and appropriate intervention for marginalized young adults. Further, our results suggest that the effects of MBRP on long-term substance use outcomes may be partially explained by reduced stress.\" Mindfulness with Whole Person Addiction Recovery Long-term addiction recovery is dependent on discarding habitual behaviors - and instead engaging in new sober and healthful activities.
