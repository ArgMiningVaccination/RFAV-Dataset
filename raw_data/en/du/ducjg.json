How we Harness the Power of Nature Babies Giving your baby what they need We check children's spines and nervous systems because they deserve to grow up healthy and strong. In order to do so, their brains and bodies must communicate clearly. Whenever there is a spinal restriction, a bone out of alignment, a joint that doesn't move correctly it decreases the ability of the brain to talk with the body. That is why we check every child's spine, to make sure they have the best chance at optimal health.
