The purpose of MS ENT is to standardize Otorhinolaryngology teaching at Post Graduate level throughout the country so that it will benefit in achieving uniformity in undergraduate teaching as well and resultantly creating competent ENT Surgeons with appropriate expertise. The purpose of this document is to provide teachers and learners illustrative guidelines to achieve defined outcomes through learning and assessment. This document was prepared by various subject-content specialists. The Reconciliation Board of Academic Committee has attempted to render uniformity without compromise to purpose and content of the document. Compromise in purity of syntax has been made in order to preserve the purpose and content. This has necessitated retention of \"domains of learning\" under the heading \"competencies\".

Bedside teaching, grand rounds, structured interactive group discussions and clinical demonstrations should be the hallmark of clinical/practical learning with appropriate emphasis on e-learning. Student should have hand-on training in performing various procedures and ability to interpret various tests/investigations. Exposure to newer specialized diagnostic/therapeutic procedures concerning her/his subject should be given. Self-learning tools like assignments and case-based learning may be promoted. Exposure to newer specialized diagnostic/therapeutic procedures concerning ENT should be given. 1. Rotations: A major portion of posting should be in ENT Department. It should include in-patients, out-patients, ICU, trauma, emergency room, specialty clinics includingVertigo Clinic, Rhinology Clinic, Otology Clinic, Cancer Clinic, Cadaveric dissection Lab, Audiology and speech therapy. Inter-unit rotation in the department should be done for a period of up to one year. Rotation in appropriate related subspecialties for a total period not exceeding 06 months. 2. Clinical meetings: There should be intra- and inter- departmental meetings for discussing the uncommon /interesting cases involving multiple departments. 3. Log book: Each student must be asked to present a specified number of cases for clinical discussion, perform procedures/tests/operations/present seminars/review articles from various journals in inter-unit/interdepartmental teaching sessions. They should be entered in a Log Book. The Log books shall be checked and assessed periodically by the faculty members imparting the training. 4. Thesis writing and research: Thesis writing is compulsory. 5. The postgraduate students shall be required to participate in the teaching and training programme of undergraduate students and interns. 6. A postgraduate student of a postgraduate degree course in broad specialities/super specialities would be required to present one poster presentation, to read one paper at a national/state conference and to present one research paper which should be published/accepted for publication/sent for publication during the period of his postgraduate studies so as to make him eligible to appear at the postgraduate degree examination. 7. The student should know the basic concepts of research methodology, plan a research project, be able to retrieve information from the library. The student should have a basic knowledge of statistics. 8. Department should encourage e-learning activities. During the training programme, patient safety is of paramount importance; therefore, skills are to be learnt initially on the models, later to be performed under supervision followed by performing independently; for this purpose, provision of surgical skills laboratories in the medical colleges is mandatory. ASSESSMENT Assessment should be comprehensive & objective. It should address the stated competencies of the course. The assessment needs to be spread over the duration of the course. FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT, i.e., assessment during the training would include: Formative assessment should be continual and should assess medical knowledge, patient care, procedural & academic skills, interpersonal skills, professionalism, self directed learning and ability to practice in the system. General Principles Internal Assessment should be frequent, cover all domains of learning and used to provide feedback to improve learning; it should also cover professionalism and communication skills. The Internal Assessment should be conducted in theory and clinical examination. Quarterly assessment during the MS training should be based on following educational activities: 1. Journal based / recent advances learning 2. Patient based /Laboratory or Skill based learning 3. Self directed learning and teaching 4. Departmental and interdepartmental learning activity 5. External and Outreach Activities / CMEs The student to be assessed periodically as per categories listed in postgraduate student appraisal form (Annexure I). SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT ie.,at the end of the training The summative examination would be carried out as per the Rules given in POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION REGULATIONS, 2000. The examination will be in three parts: 1. Thesis Every post graduate student shall carry out work on an assigned research project under the guidance of a recognised Post Graduate Teacher, the result of which shall be written up and submitted in the form of a Thesis. Work for writing the Thesis is aimed at contributing to the development of a spirit of enquiry, besides exposing the candidate to the techniques of research, critical analysis, acquaintance with the latest advances in medical science and the manner of identifying and consulting available literature. Thesis shall be submitted at least six months before the Theory and Clinical / Practical examination. The thesis shall be examined by a minimum of three examiners; one internal and two external examiners, who shall not be the examiners for Theory and Clinical examination. A candidate shall be allowed to appear for the Theory and Practical/Clinical examination only after the acceptance of the Thesis by the examiners. 2. Theory The examinations shall be organised on the basis of 'Grading'or 'Marking system' to evaluate and to certify candidate's level of knowledge, skill and competence at the end of the training. Obtaining a minimum of 50% marks in 'Theory' as well as 'Practical' separately shall be mandatory for passing examination as a whole. The examination for MS shall be held at the end of 3rd academic year. An academic term shall mean six month's training period. Theory shall consist of four papers of 3 hours each. Paper I: Basic Sciences related Otolaryngology Paper II: Principles and Practices of Otolaryngology Paper III: Recent advances in Otolaryngology and Head Neck surgery. Paper IV: General Surgical Principles and Head-Neck Surgery. 3. Clinical / Practical and viva voce Examination Clinical examination shall be conducted to test the knowledge, skills, attitude and competence of the post graduate students for undertaking independent work as a specialist/teacher, for which post graduate students shall examine a minimum one long case and two short cases. The Oral examination shall be thorough and shall aim at assessing the post graduate student's knowledge and competence about the subject, investigative procedures, therapeutic technique and other aspects of the specialty, which form a part of the examination. Assessment may include Objective Structured Clinical Examination(OSCE). Oral/Viva-voce examination needs to assess knowledge on X-rays, instrumentation, operative procedures. Due weightage should be given to Log Book Records and day- to-day observation during the training.
