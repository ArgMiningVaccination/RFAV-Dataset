We do this by working at the level of the nervous system to help your body self-correct and restore coherence to the nervous system. Vertebral subluxations can create distortions in the neuro-spinal system and interfere with the healthy function of your body. Understanding the source of these neuro-structural shifts can help minimize the number and frequency of chiropractic visits you need and help you feel your best! Chemical stressors are a significant cause of vertebral subluxations, and can come from 3 things: 1) exposure to things in the environment that are unhealthy 2) from things that you intentionally put in your body for fun even though you know they are unhealthy 3) from things you put in your body thinking they are healthy but your body doesn't respond to, or process them properly. The following detox protocol developed by Functional Medicine Practitioners helps cleanse and eliminate all three of the above sources of toxicity so your body can restore a healthy internal environment, and feel and function at it's best. Just follow these 3 simple steps: Step 1 For 7 days, consume an unlimited amount of any type of organic vegetables (excluding potatoes). Recommended vegetables: green beans, asparagus, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, green and red cabbage, kale, lettuce (romaine, red leaf, green leaf, mustard greens), peppers (red, green, yellow, and hot), spinach and zucchini. Along with the vegetables, consume an unlimited amount of any of the below recommended medical foods for 7 days, with a minimum of 4-6 servings of the prescribed medical food per day. Take 2 capsules of Detox Support with every medical food shake. Take 4 capsules per day of Omega Pure EPA-DHA 720, or 1 Tbsp daily of Omega Pure EPA-DHA 2400. (Plan Ahead: Make sure you have a minimum of 2 canisters of the medical food of choice for the 1 week intense detox. For added flavor and detoxication, add 1 scoop of NutriDyn Fruits & Greens to each serving.) Click on any of the below medical foods to purchase and for more info.
