Probably, the most beneficial remedy for kidney func- tion is to drink water! Your kidneys will have a hard time filtering wastes into urine if they do not have enough water in which to put the wastes once they take them out of the blood. Also, because the kidneys affect electrolyte and mineral balance which affects your energy levels and your bones, if you are not drinking enough water, and if you are drinking liquids that strip your minerals (think drinks like pop, coffee, and hydration drinks with fake sugars and chemical additives), then you will lack energy, and your joints will ache! Aim to drink half your body weight in ounces per day of clean, pure water! Remedies A number of herbs offer support and nutrition for bal- ancing kidney function. Consider Kidney Activator, Kidney -C, Urinary Mainte- nance, include: Juniper, EndoFlex, and JuvaFlex. Apply 1 -2 drops of your chosen oil over the kidney area on the back or in the center of the bottom of each foot. Homeopathic remedies to take note of are Berberis vulgaris, Nat phos, and Nitric acid. The emotions of the kidneys have to do with fear, anxiety, indecisiveness, not feeling supported, or lacking a secure foundation. Your Ultimate Support... Want to feel strong and full of energy? The secret is in supporting your kidneys. The kidneys are a pair of organs, each about the size of a fist, located in back of the abdomen, approxi- mately in line with the waist. Their main function is to filter the blood. Every day, your kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of waste products and extra fluid. Each kidney contains around one million nephrons (these are the microscopic filters) to remove the wastes that come from the normal breakdown of active tissues, like muscles, and from food. Whatever food the body does not use for energy or repair is sent to the blood, and if they were not removed by the kidneys, the wastes would build up in the blood and damage the body. As the kidneys filter the wastes out of the blood, this creates urine which is transported down the ureter tubes and into the bladder. The kidneys also control fluid balance and regulate electrolytes in the blood. In addition to removing wastes, the kidneys measure out certain minerals, like sodium, potassium, and phosphorus, and return them back to the blood. The proper balance of these minerals is what determines the pH of the body and is necessary for vital functions. Furthermore, the kidneys release important hor- mones: Renin (regulates blood pressure), Erythro- poietin (stimulates the bone marrow to make red blood cells), and Calcitriol (the active form of vita- min D which helps maintain calcium for the bones). Symptoms of a kidney imbalance can include back- aches, especially of the low back, kidney stones, blood pressure issues, edema and swelling, ear prob- lems, loss of hair on the head, joint problems, gout, ...Your Kidneys! Kidney Cleansing Recipes When these emotions are present, they block the flow of energy through the kidneys and can manifest into physical ailments. Recognizing these emotions and taking action to make life changes can be very powerful in healing. Additionally, there are flower remedies available to assist in balancing these emo- tions. Here are a few: Aspen for unknown fears and anxiety; Cerato for doubt and depending on advice; Larch for fear of failure; Mimulus for specific and known fears; Red Chestnut for fear and worry for others; and Scleranthus for indecision and wavering between two choices. Working with the meridians, or the energy path- ways, for the kidneys and its partner, the bladder, will aid in restoring energy flow to those organs and the body areas that they affect. To trace the Bladder Meridian, place your fingertips on the inside of each of your eyes. Now, begin moving your fingertips up over your head, down your back and legs, and down to the outside of each little toe. To trace the Kidney Meridian, place your fingertips on the bottom of the center area on the balls of your feet on both sides of your body. Now, move your fingertips up the front of the body, ending when you reach the hollow area below each collar bone. It is best to trace each meridian pathway three times, tracing on both sides of the body. So, if you struggle with anxiety or fear; if you can't seem to make a decision; if your back hurts and your joints ache, it is time to nourish your kidneys and ena- ble them to be the best filters for you that they can be! P A G E 3 The Kidneys are like gentle old souls and prefer simple cleanses that are easy and completed in a short period of time, rather than long more intense cleanses like those for parasites and the bowels. Kidney Cleanse #1 - One to two days of watermelon fasting; that's right, all you eat for 2 days is seeded watermelon, the other kind isn't even healthy! You can still drink water or herbal teas, but no food. This is a great summer rinse, and the kidneys just love it! It's a great idea to eat the white seeds, because they are great for the reproductive system. Some folks, like Bessheen, even juice the watermelon with the inner rind and white seeds included. \"It's very strengthening!\" Kidney Cleanse #2 - This one is great for people who ache all the time! Remember, what is understood around the world in tradi- tional healing arts, the kidneys rule the structure, and when there is a problem with the joints, bones, back, muscles etc., it's time to support and heal the urinary system! Start with one good urinary formula such as Urinary Maintenance, Kidney Activator, or K idney Drainage. Follow the instructions on the bottle or touch base with your natural health consultant. While doing the aforeme ntioned, drink 1/2 c. fresh lemon juice per day in your drinking water, and use Hannah Krueger's Kidney Tea, drinking one strong quart per day! This can be done for 3 days to 3 weeks. Longer than 3 weeks could become draining to your kidney vitality. Those who have tried it ache a lot less or not at all! Kidney Cleanse #3 - This cleanse is good for those with tendencies toward infections with the kidneys and/or bladder system. JP -X is a hands down favorite urinary infection formula. It is often taken 2 caps 3 times per day. Additionally a good friendly bacteria is used like Probiotic 11; this is also taken 2 caps 3 times per day. Then, the oil of juniper is applied to the back and lower abdominal area by means of a roller bottle diluted with base oil; this is applied 3x a day. This fights infection and/or tendency for infection: 10 days is recommended. If infections persist, it's time to come in for a 15 minute appointment and see if you have one of 3 pro blematic parasites that live in the urinary system and cause repeated infections: these parasites are resistant to antibiotics!

Here's how it works: N I T E L I G H T P A G E 4 Minerals Spotlight on Boron Published in the June/July 2012 issue of Nexus magazine How the Arthritis Cure has been Stopped http://www.health -science -spirit.com/borax.htm You may not be able to imagine that Borax, this humble insecticide and laundry detergent, has the potential of single- handedly bringing down our entire economic system. But you do not need to worry, the danger has been recognized and the necessary steps are already being taken to defuse the situation. I will start with the basics and you will understand what I mean as the story unfolds. Borax is a naturally occurring and mined mineral salt and the source of other manufac- tured boron compounds. The main deposits are in Turkey and California. Chemical names are 1) sodium tetraborate decahydrate , 2) disodium tetraborate decahydrate . This means it contains four atoms of boron as its central feature combined with two sodium atoms and ten molecules (or sometimes less) of crystallization water. Ingested boron com- pounds are rapidly and nearly completely excreted with the urine. Formerly, boric acid was widely used as a preservative in foods but is now banned for this purpose in most countries and is also banned from public sale in Australia . According to conventional medicine, it is not known if boron is essential for humans, but research shows that we do need it. The reason why it was difficult to answer this question is the presence of boron in all plants and unprocessed foods. Diets with a fair amount of fruit and vegetables provide about 2 to 5 mg of boron per day, but this also depends on the region where the food was grown and how it was grown. In reality, the average intake in developed countries is 1 -2 mg of boron per day. Institutionalized patients may receive only 0.25 mg of daily boron. Chemical fertilizers inhibit the up- take of boron from the soil : an organic apple grown in good soil may have 20 mg boron, but if grown with fertilizer, it may have only 1 mg of boron. Fertilizers combined with poor food choices have greatly reduced our boron intake com- pared to 50 or 100 years ago. Further, unhealthy cooking methods greatly reduce the availability of boron from food. The cooking water of vegetables containing most of the minerals may be discarded during home cooking or commercial processing; phytic acid in baked goods, cereals and cooked legumes may greatly reduce availability, while gluten sensi- tivity and Candida overgrowth inhibit the absorption of minerals. All this makes health problems due to boron deficiency now very common. Health Effects of Boron Due to their content of boron, borax and boric acid have basically the same health effects with good antiseptic , antifungal , and antiviral properties but only mild antibacterial action. In plants as well as animals, boron is essential for the integrity and function of cell walls and the way signals are transmitted across membranes. Boron is distributed throughout the body with the highest concentration in the parathyroid glands , followed by bones and dental enamel . It is essential for healthy bone and joint function, regulating the absorption and metabo- lism of calcium, magnesium and phosphorus through its influence on the parathyroid glands. With this, boron is for the parathyroids what iodine is for the thyroid . Boron deficiency causes the parathyroids to become overactiv e, releasing too much parathyroid hormone which raises the blood level of calcium by releasing calcium from bones and teeth . This then leads to osteoarthritis and other forms of arthritis, osteoporosis and tooth decay . With advancing age, high blood levels of calcium lead to calcification of soft tissues causing muscle contractions and stiffness; calcification of endocrine glands, especially the pineal gland and the ovaries ; arteriosclerosis, kidney stone s, and calcification of the kidneys, ultimately leading to kidney failure. Boron deficiency combined with magnesium deficiency is especially damaging to the bones and teeth. Boron affects the me- tabolism of steroid hormones and especially, of sex hormones. It increases low testosterone levels in men and estrogen levels in menopausal women. It also has a role in converting vitamin D to its active form, thus increasing calcium uptake and deposition into bone and teeth rather than causing soft tissue to calcify. Also other beneficial effects have been re- ported such as improvement of heart problems, vision, psoriasis, balance, memory and cognition. The German cancer researcher Dr Paul -Gerhard Seeger has shown that cancer commonly starts with the deterioration of cell membranes. As boron is essential for cell membranes and boron deficiency widespread, this may be an important cause for the initiation of tumor growth. Boron compounds have anti -tumor properties and are \"potent anti -osteoporotic, anti-inflammatory, hypolipemic, anti -coagulant and anti -neoplasmic agents\" (1). This overview shows the wide -ranging influence of boron on our health. In the following, I want to describe some of these health effects in greater detail.

The average medical appoint- aspects of your health. This assessment takes note of your pH, mineral levels, energy levels, hydration levels, diges- tion, ability to detoxify, as well as major organs and cell structures. Once complete, you are given a colored chart of your organs, mineraliza- tion and toxicity levels. How old does your body feel? Older than your chronological age?

The different red lines and markings that ap- pear in the whites also relate to parts of the body.

Meridians are pathways in the body that correspond to the organs and distribute energy for the purpose of interacting with the ana- tomical system, transmit- ting electromagnetic cur- rent for healing purposes, and interacting with the external environment. Different points along the meridian pathways are commonly used in acu- puncture and acupressure therapies. Just like an electrical power line, when a meridian has a disruption in its flow, it affects your overall health and energy. The Meridian Clearing therapy is designed to en- sure that every meridian is \"on line\" and its energy is flowing smoothly to pro- mote balance and optimal health. Relax on a mas- sage table while your na- turopath works with points on your body and in your electromagnetic field to re - align your personal power grid.

She was also frus- trated. She had come to a point in life where she had gained weight and was not happy with how she looked. Her husband, Jason, had also gained weight, and after visiting their medi- cal doctor, they were told to eat healthy and that would help them lose the weight. Eat healthy: what did that mean ex- actly? Jason then attended a homeschooling conference that fea- tured a naturopath as a guest speaker. He came home ex- cited with infor- mation about herbs and other natural remedies. Ann's dad, who was con- fined to bed waiting for back surgery, started taking some of the nutritional remedies recom- mended by the na- turopath. By the time he was due for surgery, the surgeon told him to keep do- ing what he was do- ing. Ann's dad got better without sur- gery and told Ann, \"There is power in these herbs. Let's start a store with herbs.\" Herbs & More opened in April of 2007. In May, Bessheen's brother visited Ann's store and told her about the Naturopathic Institute, and by June, Ann was en- rolled in the school. She says she had no idea what she was getting into; she just wanted to gain some knowledge to better run her store. Then, she says, \"By class two, I found my passion.\" Ann graduated from the four year natu- ral health program at NITE as a Certi- fied Naturopath and is a Board Certified Naturopathic Doc- tor in 2012. There is power in these herbs. Let's start a store! \"By class two, I found my passion.\" Look Here Every Issue for NITE Graduates Alumni Spot Light on... Anne Cole, ND at Herbs & More Located in Elkton, which is in the thumb area of Michigan, Herbs & More offers consultations, thera- pies, Nature's Sun- shine products, home- opathic remedies, flower remedies, es- sential oils, natural healthy and beauty products, natural cleaning supplies, and bulk herbs. And, of course, healthy foods. Ann says that she was telling her clients to eat healthy, but they had nowhere to get healthy food, so Herbs & More now carries organic meats, fruits, and vegetables, gluten free and dairy free foods, bulk foods, and other organic foods, like cheeses, milk, and frozen foods. As a naturopath, Ann loves working with people and learning about minerals and how they work in the body. She sees that most of her clients need help with their digestion and nervous systems. A top priority is helping people learn how to cook and how to use different foods, especially avoiding wheat. \"Our food is our medicine, and we have lost the art of knowing how to eat to stay healthy,\" Ann shares. Ann, herself, has lost over 80 pounds since her journey into natu- ral health began. She feels healthier and has more energy. She says, \"My entire life has been turned upside right, and I see the world in a different light.\" To current natural health students, she of- fers the advice of keep on keeping on. \"The schooling is tough, but it is worth it when you are done. When sit- ting down with peo- ple and being able to shine a light in their darkness; it is one of the best feelings ev- er.\" She also adds that one of your big- gest clients is your- self. \"The healing I went through was well worth the schooling. The first step starts with you and getting yourself healthy and educated before you can help other people.\" Herbs & More 5224 Whalen Street Elkton, Michigan.

Boron Continued N I T E L I G H T The Arthritis Cure of Rex Newnham In the 1960's, Rex Newnham, Ph.D., D.O., N.D, developed arthritis. At that time, he was a soil and plant scientist in Perth, Western Australia. Conventional drugs did not help, so he looked for the cause into the chemistry of plants. He realized that plants in that area were rather mineral deficient. Knowing that boron aids calcium metabolism in plants, he decided to try it. He started taking 30 mg of borax a day, and in three weeks all pain, swelling and stiffness had disappeared. He told public health and medical school authorities about his discovery, but they were not interested. However, some people with arthritis were delighted as they improved. Others were scared to take something with a poison label on the container and meant to kill cockroaches and ants. Eventually, he had tablets made with a safe and effective quantity of borax. Within five years and only by word of mouth, he sold 10,000 bottles a month. He could no longer cope and asked a drug company to market it. That was a major mistake. They indicated that this would replace more expensive drugs and reduce their profits. It so happened that they had representatives on government health committees and arranged that in 1981, Australia instituted a regulation that declared boron and its compounds to be poisons in any concentration. He was fined $1000 for selling a poison, and this successfully stopped his arthritis cure from spreading in Australia. (2) Subsequently, he published several scientific papers on borax and arthritis. One was a double -blind trial in the mid 1980's at the Royal Melbourne Hospital which showed that 70% of those who completed the trial were greatly improved. Only 12% im- proved when on placebo. There were no negative side -effects, but some reported that their heart ailment had also im- proved, and there was better general health and less tiredness. (3) Most of his later research was devoted to the relationship between soil boron levels and arthritis. He found, for instance, that the traditional sugarcane islands, due to long -term heavy use of fertilizers , have very low soil -boron levels . Jamai- ca has the lowest level, and arthritis rates are about 70% . He noted that even most dogs were limping. Next comes Mauritius with very low boron levels and 50% arthritis . The daily boron intake in these countries is less than 1 mg/day . An interesting comparison is between Indian and native Fijians . The Indians are estimated to have an arthritis rate of about 40% and eat much rice grown with fertilizer, while the native Fijians with an estimated arthritis rate of 10% eat mainly starchy root vegetables grown privately without fertilizer. These are also high in Israel with an esti- mated daily boron intake of 5 to 8 mg and only 0.5 - 1% arthritis. Bone analysis showed that arthritic joints and nearby bones had only half the boron content of healthy joints. Equal- ly, synovial fluid that lubricates joints and provides nutrients to the cartilage is boron deficient in arthritic joints. After boron supplementation, bones were much harder than normal, and surgeons found them more difficult to saw through. With additional boron, bone fractures heal in about half the normal time in both man and animal . Horses and dogs with broken legs, or even a broken pelvis, have fully recovered. Borax is also effective with other forms of ar- thritis, such as Rheumatoid Arthritis , Juvenile Arthritis , and Lupus (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus). For instance, Dr Newnham saw a young girl aged 9 months with juvenile arthritis. He was able to cure her in 2 weeks . He wrote that people can commonly get rid of their pain, swelling and stiffness in about 1 to 3 months. Then, they can reduce treatment from 3 to 1 boron tablet (each 3 mg) per day as a maintenance dose so that they can avoid any future arthritis. He also stated that patients with rheumatoid arthritis commonly experienced a Herxheimer reaction [healing reaction], and that this is always a good prognostic sign. They must persevere, and in another 2 or 3 weeks, the pain, swelling and stiffness will be gone. (4,5) I found this statement not only interesting, but also surprising. The Herxheimer reaction is an early aggravation of symp- toms with increased pain. It is commonly due to toxins released by killed Candida and mycoplasma . This is very com- mon with antimicrobial therapy, and borax definitely is an exceptionally good and strong fungicide . What surprises me, however, is that this fungicidal effect is already present at this rather low dose of 75 to 90 mg of borax. Equally surprisin g is the finding that also up to 30% of those with osteoarthritis experienced a Herxheimer reaction, suggesting that the bor- der between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis is rather fluid. I believe that in long -standing and especially resistant cases, it will be advisable to use other antimicrobials in addition. Osteoporosis and Sex Hormones Boron deficiency causes greatly increased amounts of calcium and magnesium to be lost with the urine. A borax supplement will reduce the daily loss of calcium by nearly 50%. As this calcium comes mainly from reabsorbed bone and teeth, boron deficiency may be the most important factor in causing osteoporosis and tooth decay. It has been estimated that 55% of Americans over 50 have osteoporosis, and of these, about 80% are women. Worldwide, 1 in 3 women and 1 in 12 men over the age of 50 may have osteoporosis, and this is responsible for millions of fractures each year. Rats with osteoporosis were given a boron supplement for 30 days with the result that their bone quality was now comparable with that of the healthy control group and of a group supplemented with estradiol (6). The beneficial effect of borax on bones seems to be due to two interrelated effects: a higher boron content of the bones which makes them harder and a normalization of sex hormones which stimulates the growth of new bone . Low es- trogen levels after menopause are thought to be the main reason why so many older women develop osteoporosis. In men, testosterone levels decline more gradually which seems to be reflected in their later onset of osteoporosis as a group. Research has now shown that boron supplementation in postmenopausal women doubles the blood level of the most active form of estrogen, 17 -beta estradiol, to the level found in women on estrogen replacement therapy. Equally, the blood levels of testosterone more than doubled (7). With HRT [hormone replacement therapy], there is a higher risk of breast or endometrial cancer which is not known to happen with hormones produced by the body as with borax sup- plementation. Some women get premenstrual problems because estrogen levels are too high and progesterone too low and therefore, may be afraid of using boron. However, I found no evidence that boron raises estrogen above normal healthy levels. Bo- ron may balance levels of sex hormones similar to the action of maca root powder. Maca acts on the pituitary gland not only to increase but also to balance our sex hormones and seems to stimulate our own progesterone production as need- ed. A recent study in younger men (29 - 50) showed that the level of free testosterone (the form that matters most) had risen by one third after a daily supplementation of about 100 mg of borax for one week (8). This is of special interest for bodybuilders. Contrary to the medical preference of chemically castrating men with prostate cancer, research with boron has shown that elevated testosterone levels are beneficial by shrinking prostate tumors and PSA levels , PSA [prostate specific antigen] being a marker for tumors and inflammation in the prostate. Also, significantly improved memory and cognition in elderly individuals may be partly due to increased levels of sex hormones and partly to im- proved membrane functions of brain cells (9). I have been asked about boron supplementation for women with estrogen - sensitive breast cancer. Breast cancer is related to calcifications in the breast . In my opinion, it is more important to normalize the calcium -magnesium metabolism and cellular membrane functions rather than feel restricted by a possibly faulty medical concept, especially as I believe that cancer can usually be controlled with long -term antimicrobial thera- py. Therefore, I would use boron as well as maca in this case There is another 5 pages to this amazing article, and we simply didn't have the room for it! Please come in for a com- plete copy or look it up on the internet. We are now carrying Fruite B, a wonderful Boron supplement.
