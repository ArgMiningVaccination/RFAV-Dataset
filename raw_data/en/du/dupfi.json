Considered a fundamental component to the success of healthcare systems and improved patient outcomes , establishing effective communication within and across the continuum of care will help to improve the quality and affordability of our system. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), it is estimated that there is a potential opportunity of $240 billion in savings result ing from care coordination initiatives such as patient education and the development of new provider payment models. Currently, NQF's portfolio of care coordination measures include measures for emergency department transfers, plan of care, e -prescribing, ti mely transitions, medication management, transition records, and medical home. Although m any of th ese are among NQF's newer measures , dating back to 200 7, several are currently being used in public and/or private accountability and quality improvement programs. Recognizing the need to establish a meaningful foundation for future development of a set of practices with demonstrated impact on patient outcomes, NQF endorsed a definition and measurement framework for care coordination, establishing five domains essential to measurement in 2010. In July 2011, NQF launched a multi -phased Care Coordination project focused on health care coordination across episodes of care and care transitions. The first phase of the project sought to address the lack of cross-cutting measures in the NQF measure portfolio by developing a path forward for meaningful measures of care coordination leveraging health information technology. This work was strengthened by the development of a commissioned paper examining electronic capabilities to support care coordination measurement as well as the findings of an environmental scan . The Steering Committee used th ese findings to discuss the pathway forward and the goals for future measures. These goals were reflected in the second phase call for measures; however NQF did not receive any new measures for review despite extensive targeted outreach to solicit new measures that address cross -cutting components of care coordination .\u00b9 In Phase 3 of this project , the Standing Committee evaluated 12 measures: 1 new measure and 11 measures undergoing maintenance review against NQF's standard evaluation criteria. Eleven of the measures were recommended for endorsement by the Committee, and one was not recommended (#0487 ). The 1 1 measures that were recommended by the Standing Committee are: 0291: Administrative Communication 0292: Vital Signs 3 0293: Medication Informati on 0294: Patient Information 0295: Physician Information 0296: Nursing Information 0297: Procedures and Tests 0495: Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Admitted ED Patients 0496: Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Discharged ED Pat ients 0497: Admit Decision Time to ED Departure Time for Admitted Patients 2456: Medication Reconciliation: Number of Unintentional Medication Discrepancies per Patient Brief summaries of the measures currently under review are included in the body of this report; detailed summaries of the Committee's discussion and ratings of the criteria are included in Appendix A. Five existing measures in the portfolio were retired and were not reviewed; de tails are included in Appendix A. Introduction Care Coordination is a multidimensional concept that encompasses \u2014among many other facets of healthcare organization and delivery \u2014the effective communication between patients and their families, caregivers, and healthcare providers; safe care transitions; a longitudinal view of care that considers the past, while monitoring delivery of care in the present and anticipating the needs of the future; and the facilitation of linkages between communities and the healthcare system to address medical, social, educat ional, and other support needs, in alignment with patient goals. Because poorly coordinated care regularly leads to unnecessary suffering for patients, as well as avoidable readmissions and emergency department visits, increased medical errors, and higher costs, coordination of care is increasingly recognized as critical for improvement of patient outcomes and the success of healthcare systems. For example, individuals with chronic conditions and multiple co - morbidities \u2014and their families and caregivers \u2014often find it difficult to navigate our complex and fragmented healthcare system. As this ever -growing group transitions from one care setting to another, poor outcomes resulting from incomplete or inaccurate transfer of information, poor communication, and a lack of follow -up care become more likely. Yet the sharing of information across settings and between providers through electronic health records (EHRs) could reduce the unnecessary and costly duplication of patient services,\u00b9 while the number of serious medication events could be reduced through patient education and the reconciliation of medication lists. \u00b2 The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimates that adverse medication events cause more than 770,000 injuries and deaths each year, more than half of which affect those over age 65. \u00b3 The cost of treating patients who are harmed by these events is estimated to be as high as $5 billion annually. Furthermore, the Institute of Medicine has found that care coordination initiatives such as patient education and the development of new provider payment models could result in an estimated $240 billion in saving s. Due to the multi -disciplinary nature of effective care coordination, NQF's efforts in this area have been diverse. NQF began to address the complex issue of care coordination measurement in 2006. At that time, sufficiently developed measures of care coordination could not be identified for endorsement. However, NQF did endorse a definition and a framework fo r care coordination measurement. The 4 definition characterized care coordination as a \"function that helps ensure that the patient's needs and preferences for health services and information sharing across people, functions, and sites are met over time\" and the framework identified five domain s essential to the future measurement of care coordination, as follows: Healthcare Home Proactive Plan of Care and Follow -Up; Communication; Information Systems; and Transitions or Handoffs. The standardized definition and endorsed framework establish ed a strong foundation for continued work in this area. In 2010, NQF published the Preferred Practices and Performance Measures for Measuring and Reporting Care Coordination Consensus Report . The measures submitted to this project were predominately cond ition -specific process or survey -based measures, with very few crossing providers or settings. Through this project, 10 performance measures were endorsed; however, these measures addressed only two of the domains within the Care Coordination Framework (Tr ansitions and Proactive Plan of Care). Recognizing the need to establish a meaningful foundation for future development of a set of practices with demonstrated impact on patient outcomes, NQF additionally endorsed 25 Preferred Practices through this projec t. These practices were considered suitable for widespread implementation and could be applied and generalized across multiple care settings. In its role as the convener of the National Priorities Partnership (NPP), NQF supports the priorities and goals identified by the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) National Quality Strategy. NPP have long supported care coordination as a national priority. In 2010, NPP convened a Care Coordination workgroup that identified actions to achieve reductions in 30 -day readmissions. Workgroup members identified barriers to achieving this goal and discussed o pportunities to leverage health information technology and build system capacity. In preparation for this workshop, NQF commissioned a background paper: Aligning Our Efforts to Achieve Care Coordination. This paper offered an overview of the national state of care coordination activities and recommended high -level drivers of change. Meanwhile, The HIT team at NQF initiated a project to assess the readiness of electronic data and health IT systems to support quality measurement of care planning during trans itions of care, as well as provide recommendations for advancing such infrastructure. The expert panel convened for this project completed a review of industry initiatives related to the plan of care use in care coordination, workflow and data components r elated to the plan of care, and identification of the characteristics of the plan of care. This work informed an environmental scan to develop a baseline unders tanding of the use of HIT to support transitions of care and quality measurement. NQF worked with Brigham and Women's Hospital to conduct the environmental scan , and the results demonstrate the opportunity to improve data capture and exchange to support patient -centered, longitudinal plans of care. The TEP will make recommendations to advance the capture of essential care plan data elements at the point of care, promote the adoption of interoperability standards, and enhance the use of care plan data in decision support. These recommendations could greatly advance quality improvement and measurement activities of care coordination. In 2012 , NQF's Measure Applicati ons Partnership (MAP) identified an initial group of measure families, sets of related available measures and measure gaps that span programs, care settings, levels of analysis, and populations for specific topic areas related to the 5 National Quality Strat egy (NQS) priorities and high -impact conditions. MAP's Families of Measures report released October 1, 2012 includes a Care Coordination Measure Family with 62 available measures and a number of measure gap areas. The family includes measures addressing av oidable admissions and readmissions, system infrastructure support, care transitions, communication, care planning, and patient surveys related to care coordination. The MAP's Recommendations for Measures released January 28 , 2014 included previously identified priority gap areas for care coordination in the areas of communication, system and infrastructure support and avoidable admissions and readmissions. Building on previous work , in 2013 HHS engaged NQF to pursue a Care Coordin ation gaps prioritization project. \u00b9 The prioritization work is concurrent with this project and is focused on a ssessing the status of measure gaps more broadly, and is intended to further advance the aims and priorities of the National Quality Strategy by identifying priorities for performance measurement; scanning for potential measures and measure concepts to address these priorities; and developing multi -stakeholder recommendations for future measure development and endorsement. This work is discussed in greater detail in the section of this report entitled \" Improving NQF's Care Coordination Portfolio .\" Emergency Department Transfers In 2005, 85 percent of emergency room visits ended in discharges. Developing protocols or standards of practice to arrange the transition to outpatient care is an integral part of care coordination. Poor communication during transitions leads to increased rates in hospital r eadmissions, medical errors, and poor health outcomes . It is extremely difficult to reach the emergency department or hospital once a transfer is complete and use of care coordination strategies at the time of transfer can help ensure that the patient info rmation is transmitted fully and in a timely fashion. Medication Reconciliation Medication reconciliation refers to the process of avoiding inadvertent inconsistencies across transitions in care by reviewing the patient's complete medication regimen at the time of admission, transfer, and discharge and comparing it with the regimen being considered for the new setting of care. Such unintended inconsistencies \u2014 omit of needed medications, unnecessarily duplicate existing therapies or incorrect dosages in medication regimens \u2014 may occur at any point of transition in care. Studies have shown that unintended medication discrepancies occur in nearly one -third of patients at admission, a similar proportion at the time of transfer from one site of care within a h ospital, and in 14% of patients at hospital discharge thus showing a significant issue within care coordination. \u00b9 Timely Transition s Poorly managed and untimely transitions can diminish health and increase health care costs. Researchers have estimated th at inadequate care coordination, including inadequate management of care transitions, was responsible for $25 to $45 billion in wasteful spending in 2011 through avoidable complications and unnecessary hospital readmissions. Without effective, timely commu nication between physicians, both the quality of care and the patient experience can suffer. Establishing efficient and effective approache s are essential to not only improving patient and family experiences but helping to minimize readmission rates. \u00b9\u00b9 6 National Quality Strategy The National Quality Strategy (NQS) serves as the overarching framework for guiding and aligning public and private efforts across all levels (local, State, and national) to improve the quality of health care in the U.S .\u00b9\u00b2 The NQ S establishes the \"triple aim\" of better care, affordable care, and healthy people/communities, focusing on six priorities to achieve those aims: Safety, Person and Family Centered Care, Communication and Care Coordination, Effective Prevention and Treatme nt of Illness, Best Practices for Healthy Living, and Affordable Care .\u00b9\u00b3 Improvement efforts for emergency transfers, medication reconciliation and transition time are consistent with the NQS triple aim and align with the of NQS priorit y of Communication and Care Coordination. Coordination of care is a priorit y because it helps to ensure that the needs and preferences of the patient for health services and information sharing across people, functions, and sites are met over time. As a result , maximizes the value of services delivered to patients by facilitating beneficial, efficient, safe, and high -quality patient experiences and improved healthcare outcomes. Impact of Measurement Care coordination is a vital aspect of health and healthcare se rvices. When care is poorly coordinated \u2014 with inaccurate transmission of information, inadequate communication, and inappropriate follow -up care \u2014patients who see multiple physicians and care providers can face medication errors, hospital readmissions, and a voidable emergency department visits. The effects of poorly coordinated care are particularly evident for people with chronic conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, and those at high risk for multiple illnesses who often are expected to navigate a complex healthcare system. These standards will provide the structure, process, and outcome measures required to assess progress toward care coordination goals and to evaluate access, continuity, communication, and tracking of patients across providers and settings. Given the high -risk nature of transitions in care, this work will build on ongoing efforts among the medical and surgical specialty societies to establish principles for effective patient hand -offs among clinicians and providers. As this ever -growing group attempts to navigate our complex healthcare system and transition from one care setting to another, they often are unprepared or unable to manage their care. Incomplete or inaccurate transfer of information, poor communication, and a lack of ap propriate follow -up care can lead to confusion and poor outcomes, including medication errors and often preventable hospi tal readmissions and ED visits. Care Coordination Measure Evaluation: Refining the Evaluation Process A change to the Consensus Devel opment Process (CDP) : transitioning to Standing Steering Committees ; has been incorporated into the ongoing maintenance activities for the Care Coordination portfolio. This change is described below. Standing Steering Committee In an effort to remain responsive to its stakeholders' needs, NQF is constantly working to improve the CDP. Volunteer, multi- stakeholder steering committees are the central component to the endorsement process, and the success of the CDP projects is due i n large part to the participation of its Steering Committee members. In the past, NQF initiated the Steering Committee nominations process and seated new project- specific committees only when funding for a particular project had been secured. Seating new committees with each project not only lengthened the project timeline, but also resulted in 7 a loss of process continuity and consistency because committee membership changed \u2014often quite substantially \u2014over time. To address these issues in the CDP, NQF is beginning to transition to the use of Standing Steering Committees for various topic areas. These Standing Committees will oversee the various measure portfolios; this oversight function will include evaluating both newly -submitted and previously -endorse d measures against NQF's measure evaluation criteria, identifying gaps in the measurement portfolio, providing feedback on how the portfolio should evolve, and serving on any ad hoc or expedited projects in their designated topic areas. The Care Coordin ation Standing Committee currently includes 2 4 members (see Appendix D ). Each member has been randomly appointed to serve an initial two - or three - year term, after which he/she may serve a subsequent 3 -year term if desired. NQF Portfolio of performance measures for Care Coordination Currently, NQF's portfolio of care coordination measures includes measures for emergency department transfers, plan of care, e -prescribing, timely transitions, medication management, transition records, and medical home ]. This portfolio contains 20 measures: 8 process measures, 3 outcome and resource use measures, 8 structural measures, and 1 composite measure (see table below). Eleven of these measures will be evaluated by the Care Coordination Committee. NQF Care Coordination Portfolio of Measures Process Outcome Structural Composite Emergency Department Transfers 7 0 0 0 Plan of Care 1 0 0 0 E-prescribing 0 0 1 0 Timely Transitions 1 3 0 0 Medication Management 3 0 0 0 Transition Records 3 0 0 0 Medical Home 0 0 0 1 Total 15 3 1 1 The remaining 11 measures are currently endorsed and not due for endorsement maintenance until August 2015 , at which time may then be reviewed for re -endorsement . Endorsement of measures by NQF is valued not only because the evaluation process itself is both rigorous and transparent, but also because evaluations are conducted by multi -stakeholder committees comprised of clinicians and other experts from hospitals and other healthcare providers, employers, health plans, public agencies, community coalitions, and patients \u2014many of whom use measures on a daily basis to ensure better care. Moreover, NQF -endorsed measures undergo routine \"maintenance\" (i.e., re -evaluatio n) to ensure that they are still the best- available measures and reflect the current science. Importantly, legislative 8 mandate requires that preference be given to NQF -endorsed measures for use in federal public reporting and performance -based payment programs. NQF measures also are used by a variety of stakeholders in the private sector, including hospitals, health plans, and communities. Over time, and for various reasons, some previously -endorsed care coordination -related measures have been withdrawn from the full NQF portfolio (see Ap pendix A ). In some cases, the measure steward may want to continue maintain the measure for endorsement (e.g., update specifications as new drugs/tests become available or as diagnosis/procedure codes evolve or go through NQF's measure maintenance process). In other cases, measures may lose endorsement upon maintenance review. Loss of endorsement can occur for many different reasons including \u2014but not limited to \u2014a change in evidence without an associated change in specifica tions, high performance on a measure signifying no further opportunity for improvement, and endorsement of a superior measure. Use of measures in the portfolio Many of the care coordination measures in the portfolio are among NQF's newer measures, several of which have been endorsed since 2008. Many are in use in at least one federal program . Also, several of the care coordination measures have been included in the Care Coordination Family of Measures by the NQF -convened Measure Applications P artnership (MAP). See Appendix C for details of federal program use for the measures in the portfolio that are currently under review. \u00b9 Improving NQF's Care Coordination Portfolio Addressing Measure Gaps Despite the set of measures endorsed in Phase 2 and an existing set of preferred practices, there remain significant gaps in meaningful, high impact measures of care coordination. For example, there is a lack of cross -cutting measures that span various types of providers and episodes of care. Such measures have the potential to be applied more broadly and be more useful for those with multiple chronic conditions. A concurrent project at NQF - Prioritizing Measure Gaps - will recommend the most fertile ground for meaningful measure development to HHS in five key areas, including care coordination. The care coordination topic area focuses on examining opportunities to meas ure care coordination in the context of a broad \"health neighborhood ,\" and will specifically explore coordination between safety -net providers of primary care and providers of community and social services that impact health. The work is intended to broaden the current scope of care coordination performance measurement and account for the influen ce of social determinants that affect health. To ensure alignment between the gaps project and the current measure evaluation project detailed in this report, NQF staff presented the gap project's measure domains and framework to the evaluation Committee. The framework consists of three key measurement areas and a number of domains and sub - domains beneath each area. The overarching measurement areas are: Joint creation of a person -centered Plan of Care o For example , a comprehensive assessment including ass essment of health literacy and activation level. Utilization of the Health Neighborhood to Execute the Plan of Care 9 o For example , primary care providers identify appropriate community service and contact them based on the care recipient's needs assessment. Achievement of Outcomes o For example , progress towards identified goals and experience of care measures. The Committee was then asked to discuss and recommend the most impactful and feasible areas for future measure development, understanding that a trade -off between measures' impact and development feasibility naturally exists. Throughout the discussion, three overarching themes rose to the top. First, the Committee emphasized that although experiences are very important to measure, positive health outcomes are equally as important. The approach to care should be formed by both the care recipients' priorities and evidence -based ap proaches to disease management. The Committee also agreed that the ultimate goal should be to have measures that are truly impactful. So while a need exists to consider both the impact and the feasibility of measure development and implementation, impact should be weighted more heavily. The Committee finally stressed that potential measures' application may differ based on the diverse environments in which they will be implemented (urban versus rural settings, for example). This reality implies the need f or different types of new measures, including measures of both process and outcome. The Gaps Committee met in -person on April 3-4, 2014 and heard from co -chairs Don Casey and Gerri Lamb, who summarized the measure evaluation Committee's discussion. The d raft Gaps report will be published online on June 16, 2014 and will be available for public comment at that time. Committee input on gaps in the portfolio During their discussions the Committee identified numerous areas where additional measure development is needed, and persistent gaps across settings have been identified by the MAP22 and by NQF staff (as part of a recent analysis11 of the full NQF portfolio) , specifically : Measures of patient-caregiver engagement; Measures that evaluate \" system -ness \" rather than measures that address care within silos , and Outcome and composite measures, which are prioritized by both the Committee and the MAP over individual process and structural measure s, but with the recognition that some of these latter measures are valuable. Measures in the \"pipeline\" NQF recently launched a Measure Inventory Pipeline \u2014a virtual space for developers to share information on measure development activities. Developers can use the Pipeline to display data on current and planned measure development and to share successes and challenges. Information shared via the Pipeline is available in real time and can be revised at any time. NQF expects that developers will use the Pi peline as a tool to connect to, and collaborate with, their peers on measurement development ideas. Currently, no measures related to care coordination have been submitted to the Pipeline. 10 Care Coordination Measure Evaluation In Phase 3 of the Care Coor dination Measure Evaluation Review, the Care Coordination Standing Committee evaluated 1 new measures and 11 measures undergoing maintenance review against NQF 's standard evaluation criteria. The full Committee discussed these measures during their March 1819, 2014 two-day webinar meeting and in a follow -up call on April 1 , 2014. To facilitate the evaluation, the Committee and candidate standards were divided into two workgroups for preliminary evaluation of the measures against the NQF criteria prior to consideration by the entire Standing Committee. Care Coordination Phase 3 Measure Review Summary Maintenance New Total Measures under consideration 11 1 12 Measures withdrawn from consideration 5 0 5 Measures recommended 10 1 11 Measures n ot recommended 1 0 1 Reasons for n ot recommending Importance Comments Received prior to Committee evaluation NQF solicits comments on endorsed measures on an ongoing basis through the Quality Positioning System (QPS). In addition, NQF has begun soliciting comments prior to the evaluation of the measures via an online tool located on the project webpage. For this evaluation cycle, the pre -evaluation comment period was open February 6 -20, 2014 for all of the measures under review ; however no pre - evaluation comments were received . Overarching Issues During the Standing Committee' s discussion of the measures, several overarching issues emerged that were factored into the Committee 's rating s and recommendations for multiple measures and are not repeated in detail with each individual measure . Insufficient Evidence Base The Committee noted that NQF criteria have become more rigorous following the 2010 T ask Force recommendations regarding evaluating evidence. In their review of a set of process measures related to patient transfers from emergency departments , the Committee concluded the evidence presented did not sufficiently support the claim that the measured processes improve health outcomes . The 11 Committee discussed the set of measures at length, noting that the evidence presented to support the measures was insu fficient. The Committee noted that the measures address a gap area regarding measures of emergency department transfer s that are focused on transfers from rural hospitals to other facilities , and that the measures support the communication aspect of Care Coordination by ensuring that adequate communication occu rs between transferring facilities (especially patients in rural hospitals w ho can be at higher risk) and accepting facilit ies. As a result, t he Committee ultimately exercised an exception to the evidence criterion, agreeing that it is beneficial to hold providers accountable for performance in the absence of empirical evidence , and that the benefits of the measure outweigh potential harms . Recommended Composite The Committee noted that a set of seven measures regarding the transfer of patients from rural emergency departments to other facilities is intended to be reported together to communicate a comprehensive set of patient information as part of such transfers. The Committee strongly recommended that in future, the develop er construct the se measures as a composite. Committee members were amenable to the idea of the set of measures being reported as a composite for the purposes of endorsement, while the developer would retain the capaci ty for each measure to be reported separately by current users of the measures. The Committee discussed whether all seven measures should always be included with a transferred patient , and also suggested the measures might be reported differently with di fferent data elements, depending on the next setting to which the patient is being transferred. While the Committee discussed the possibilities of how a composite might be constructed, e.g., as an all-or- none, or weighted average composite, the Committee agreed this is a consideration and decision for the developer, with the understanding the resulting composite performance measure should be based on sound measurement science, produce a reliable signal, and be a valid reflection of quality . The Committee also agreed with the concept that users should be able to \"unpack\" the composite and see individual scores on the components of the composite for their own improvement purposes. Unidirectional measurement The Committee noted that several measures for review within this project established a \"unidirectional \" communication approach which does no t ensure coordination has occurred. Although me asurement around communication is essential, the Committee stressed the need for measures that are bi - direction al in nature and that address other aspects of care related to communication . The Committee specifically emphasized the need for future measures that incorporate a \"handshake\" concept , meaning that the receipt of information needed to coordinate care as we ll as the transmittal of information should be included in measures . The Committee agreed however, that many of the measures for review address a gap area, and serve as a foundation for assessing where coordination measurement opportunities exist . Future opportunities lie in having these types of measures conceptually focused on the importance of coordinated effort s to relay information to and from providers across multiple settings. 12 Summary of Phase 3 Measure Evaluation The following brief summaries of the measures and the evaluation highlight the major issues that were considered by the Committee. Details of the Committee's discussion and ratings of the cri teria are included in Appendix A . Eleven previously NQF -endorsed measures and one newly sub mitted measure were reviewed. Eleven of the twelve measures were recommended for endorsement. 0291: Administrative Communication (University of Minnesota Rural Health Research Center ): Recommended Description: Percentage of patients transferred to another healthcare facility whose medical record documentation indicated that administrative information was communicated to the receiving facility within prior to departure ; Measure Type: Process ; Level of Analysis: Facility ; Setting of Care: Hospital/Acute Care Facility; Data Source: Administrative claims, Electronic Clinical Data, Electronic Clinical Data : Electronic Health Record, Electronic Clinical Data : Imaging/Diagnostic Study, Electronic Clinical Data : Laboratory, Paper Medical Records, Electronic Clinical Data : Pharmacy, Electronic Clinical Data : Registry This measure has been NQF -endorsed since 2007 and while not currently in use, is anticipated to be used in public reporting, payment, regulatory and accreditation, and quality improvement pro grams at the facility level. The Committee noted that the evidence presented to support the measure focus is insufficient, but agreed to exercise the exception to the evidence criterion, noting the measure addresses a gap area; it is beneficial to hold providers accountable for performance of the measure in the absence of empirical evidence, and that the benefits of the measure outweigh potential harms . The Committee agreed this measure will have a high impact due to the fact tha t transfer of comprehensive information is critical, particularly for rural hospitals. The Committee noted there is an opportunity for improvement as communication problems are a major contributing factor to adverse events in hospitals, accounting for 65 percent of sentinel events tracked by the Joint Commission, and that deficits exist in the transfer of patient information between hospitals and primary care physicians in the community, and between hos pitals and long term facilities . The Committee agreed the measure addresses a high priority aspect of healthcare, and recommended the measure. 0292: Vital Signs (University of Minnesota Rural Health Research Center ): Recommended Description: Percentage of patients transferred to another HEALTHCARE FACILITY whose medical record documentation indicated that the entire vital signs record was communicated to the receiving FACILITY within 60 minutes of departure ; Measure Type: Process ; Level of Analysis: Facility ; Setting of Care: Hospital/Acute Care Facility ; Data Source: Administrative claims, Electronic Clinical Data, Electronic Clinical Data : Electronic Health Record, Electronic Clinical Data : Imaging/Diagnostic Study, Electronic Clinical Data : Laboratory, Management Data, Paper Medical Records, Electronic Clinical Data : Pharmacy 13 Similar to 0291, t his measure has been NQF -endorsed since 2007 and while not currently in use, is anticipated to be used in public reporting, payment, regulatory and accreditation, and quality improvement programs at the facility level. The Committee noted that the evidence presented to support the measure focus is insufficient, but agreed to exercise the exception to the evidence criterion, noting the measure addresses a gap area; it is beneficial to hold providers accountable for performance of the measure in the absence of empirical evidence, and that the benefits of the measure outweigh potential harms . The Committee recommended the measure, agree ing there i s an opportunity for improvement, and that this measure will have a high impact due to the fact that transfer of vital signs is critical, especially for rural hospitals. However, the Committee expressed the need for measures like this to go further than just assessing vital signs of pulse, respiratory rate, blo od pressure, oxygen saturation , and temperature . 0293: Medication Information (University of Minnesota Rural Health Research Center ): Recommended Description: Percentage of patients transferred to another HEALTHCARE FACILITY whose medical record documentat ion indicated that medication information was communicated to the receiving FACILITY within 60 minutes of departure ; Measure Type: Process ; Level of Analysis: Facility ; Setting of Care: Hospital/Acute Care Facility ; Data Source: Administrative claims, Electronic Clinical Data, Electronic Clinical Data : Electronic Health Record, Electronic Clinical Data : Imaging/Diagnostic Study, Electronic Clinical Data : Laboratory, Management Data, Paper Medical Records, Electronic Clinical Data : Pharmacy Similar t o 0291 and 0292 , this measure has been NQF -endorsed since 2007 and while not currently in use, is anticipated to be used in public reporting, payment, regulatory and accreditation, and quality improvement programs at the facility level. The Committee noted that the evidence presented to support the measure focus is insufficient, but agreed to exercise the exception to the evidence criterion, noting the measure addresses a gap area; it is beneficial to hold providers accountable for performance of the measur e in the absence of empirical evidence, and that the benefits of the mea sure outweigh potential harms. The Committee recommended the measure, agreeing there is an opportunity for improvement and not ing the importance of receiving a comprehensive medication list with a full history , making this a high impact measure in terms of improving the coordination of care . 0294: Patient Information (University of Minnesota Rural Health Research Center ): Recommended Description: Percentage of patients transferred to another HEALTHCARE FACILITY whose medical record documentation indicated that patient information was communicated to the receiving FACILITY within 60 minutes of departure ; Measure Type: Process ; Level of Analysis: Facility ; Setting of Care: Hospital/Acute Care Facility ; Data Source: Administrative claims, Electronic Clinical Data : Electronic Health Record, Electronic Clinical Data : Imaging/Diagnostic Study, Electronic Clinical Data : Laboratory, Management Data, Paper Medical Records, Electronic Clinical Data : Pharmacy Similar to 0291, 0292 and 0293 , this measure has been NQF -endorsed since 2007 and while not currently in use, is anticipated to be used in public reporting, payment, regulatory and accreditation, and quality improvement programs at the fac ility level. The Committee noted that the evidence presented to 14 support the measure focus is insufficient, but agreed to exercise the exception to the evidence criterion, noting the measure addresses a gap area; it is beneficial to hold providers accountable for performance of the measure in the absence of empirical evidence, and that the benefits of the measure outweigh potential harms . In reviewing the v alidity testing presented, the Committee noted it was done by systematic assessment of face validity at the measure performance score and review of an expert panel. The Committee pointed out that the expert panel was relatively small and lacked consumer representation . As a result, the Committee agreed the measure passed the scientific acceptability criterion by a slim margin, indicating that true consensus was not reached on the validity of the measure. The Committee also discussed the potential administrative burden of the measure, noting that the use of multiple data sources (EHR, lab and paper) is needed to implement this measure. The Committee ultimately recommended th e measure , stating that there i s an opportunity for improvement for this measure and it addresses a high priority area. 0295: Physician Informati on (University of Minnesota Rural Health Research Center ): Recommended Description: Percentage of patients transferred to another HEALTHCARE FACILITY whose medical record documentation indicated that physician information was communicated to the receiving FACILITY within 60 minutes of departure ; Measure Type: Process ; Level of Analysis: Facility ; Setting of Care: Hospital/Acute Care Facility ; Data Source: Administrative claims, Electronic Clinical Data, Electronic Clinical Data : Electronic Health Record, E lectronic Clinical Data : Imaging/Diagnostic Study, Electronic Clinical Data : Laboratory, Management Data, Paper Medical Records, Electronic Clinical Data : Pharmacy Similar to 0291, 0292 , 0293 and 294 , this measure has been NQF -endorsed since 2007 and wh ile not currently in use, is anticipated to be used in public reporting, payment, regulatory and accreditation, and quality improvement programs at the facility level. The Committee noted that the evidence presented to support the measure focus is insuffic ient, but agreed to exercise the exception to the evidence criterion, noting the measure addresses a gap area; it is beneficial to hold providers accountable for performance of the measure in the absence of empirical evidence, and that the benefits of the measure outweigh potential harms . The Committee recommended th e measure , stating that there i s an opportunity for improvement for this measure and it addresses a high priority area. 0296: Nursing Information (University of Minnesota Rural Health Research Center ): Recommended Description: Percentage of patients transferred to another HEALTHCARE FACILITY whose medical record documentation indicated that nursing information was communicated to the receiving FACILITY within 60 minutes of departure ; Measure Ty pe: Process ; Level of Analysis: Facility ; Setting of Care: Hospital/Acute Care Facility ; Data Source: Administrative claims, Electronic Clinical Data, Electronic Clinical Data : Electronic Health Record, Electronic Clinical Data : Imaging/Diagnostic Study, Electronic Clinical Data : Laboratory, Management Data, Paper Medical Records, Electronic Clinical Data : Pharmacy Similar to 0291, 0292 , 0293, been NQF -endorsed since 2007 and while not currently in use, is anticipated to be used in public reporting, payment, regulatory and accreditation, 15 and quality improvement programs at the facility level. The Committee noted that the evidence presented to support the measure focus is insufficient, but agreed to exercise the exception to the evidence criterion, noting the measure addresses a gap area; i t is beneficial to hold providers accountable for performance of the measure in the absence of empirical evidence, and that the benefits of the measure outweigh potential harms . The Comm ittee stated that there i s an opportunity for improvement for this measure and it addresses a high priority area. The Committee discussed the feasibility of the measure at length, but determined th at the data abstraction does not appear to place undue burd en on the facility, although it may be somewhat difficult to collect without designated discrete data fields. The Committee recommended the measure. 0297: Procedures and Tests (University of Minnesota Rural Health Research Center ): Recommended Description : Performance Measure Name: Procedures and Tests Description: Patients who are transferred from an ED to another healthcare facility have communicated with the receiving facility within 60 minutes of discharge a list of tests done and results sent. ; Measur e Type: Process ; Level of Analysis: Facility ; Setting of Care: Hospital/Acute Care Facility, Behavioral Health/Psychiatric : Inpatient, Post Acute/Long Term Care Facility : Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility, Post Acute/Long Term Care Facility : Long Term Acute Care Hospital, Post Acute/Long Term Care Facility : Nursing Home/Skilled Nursing Facility ; Data Source: Administrative claims, Electronic Clinical Data, Electronic Clinical Data : Electronic Health Record, Electronic Clinical Data : Imaging/Diagnosti c Study, Electronic Clinical Data : Laboratory, Management Data, Paper Medical Records, Electronic Clinical Data : Pharmacy Similar to 0291, 0292 , 0293, been NQF -endorsed since 2007 and while not currently in use, is anticipated to be used in public reporting, payment, regulatory and accreditation, and quality improvement programs at the facility level. The Committee noted that the evidence presented to support the measure focus is insufficient, but agreed to exercise the exception to the evidence criterion, noting the measure addresses a gap area; it is beneficial to hold providers accountable for performance of the measure in the absence of empirical evidence, and that the benefits of the measure outweigh potential ha rms. In reviewing the reliability testing for the measure, t he Committee expressed concerns that the inter -rater reliability testing results are relatively low and raised questions about the level of training and experience that would be needed to report the measure. In reviewing the performance gap for the measure, the Committee agreed it is sufficient by a slim margin, indicating that true consensus was not reached . The Committee agreed the measure addresses a high priority area and recommended the measure . 0495: Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Admitted ED Patients (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ): Recommended Description: Median time from emergency department arrival to time of departure from the emergency room for patients admitted to the facility from the emergency department ; Measure Type: Outcome ; Level of Analysis: Facility ; Setting of Care: Hospital/Acute Care Facility ; Data Source: Electronic Clinical Data, Electronic Clinical Data : Electronic Health Record, Paper Records 16 This measure has been NQF -endorsed since 200 8, and is included in the CMS Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting program and the Joint Commission accreditation program . The measure is intended to address r educing the time patients remain in the emergency department (ED) , which can improve access to treatment and increase quality of care. The Committee agree d sufficient evidence is presented to support the measure. Reviewing performance on the measure since prior endorsement however , Committee mem bers expressed concern that the 5 quarters of trend data provided over years 2012 and 2013 showed little to no improvement on the measure . The developer explained that this trend may continue as crowding in the ED continues to be a problem and may increase due to other factors (such as the expansion of state Medicaid programs as part of the Affordable Care Act ). The Committee recommended the measure, agreeing the opportunity for improvement persists and that if performance is stagnating or declining, the me asure is an important tool in assessing ED crowding and potentially monitoring the impacts of ACA implementation on ED crowding. 0496: Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Discharged ED Patients (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ): Recommended Description: Median time from emergency department arrival to time of departure from the emergency room for patients discharged from the emergency department ; Measure Type: Outcome ; Level of Analysis: Facility ; Setting of Care: Hospital/Acute C are Facility ; Data Source: Administrative claims This measure has been NQF -endorsed since 200 8, and is included in the CMS Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting program and the Joint Commission accreditation program. The measure is intended to address r educ ing the time patients remain in the emergency department (ED) , which can improve access to treatme nt and increase quality of care . The Committee agreed sufficient evidence is presented to support the measure. Similar to measure 0495, in r eviewing performance on the measure since prior endorsement, Committee members expressed concern that the 5 quarters of trend data provided over years 2012 and 2013 showed little to no improvement on the measure. The developer again explained that this trend may continue as crowding in the ED continues to be a problem and may increase due to other factors (such as the expansion of state Medicaid programs as part of the Affordable Care Act). Committee members also questioned whether psychiatric patients in the ED might be included in the measure. The developer explained that due to the difficulties of placing these patients they are not included in the measure for accountability purposes, but are included in a quality improvement measure. The Committee recomm ended the measure, agreeing the opportunity for improvement persists and that if performance is stagnating or declining, the measure is an important tool in assessing ED crowding and potentially monitoring the impacts of ACA implementation on ED crowding. 0497: Admit Decision Time to ED Departure Time for Admitted Patients (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ): Recommended Description: Median time from admit decision time to time of departure from the emergency department for emergency department patients admitted to inpatient status ; Measure Type: Process ; Level of Analysis: Facility, Clinician : Group/Practice, Health Plan, Clinician : Individual ; Setting of Care: Hospital/Acute Care Facility ; Data Source: Administrative claims, Electronic Clinical Data, Electronic 17 Clinical Data : Electronic Health Record, Electronic Clinical Data : Pharmacy, Electronic Clinical Data : Registry This measure has been NQF -endorsed since 200 8, and is included in the CMS Hospita l Inpatient Quality Reporting program and the Joint Commission accreditation program. The measure is intended to address r educing the time patients remain in the emergency department (ED) , which can improve access to treatme nt and increase quality of care . The Committee agreed that this measure speaks more directly to care coordination than 0495 and 0496 as it focuses on the time from the decision to admit , to actual patient discharge from the ED . The measure emphasizes the logistical aspects of care that occur after initial evaluation. The Committee noted that a lthough the literature cited in support of the measure does not appear to specifically address the narrow window of \"decision to departure \", the Committee agreed that the evidence supports the im portance of timely care and the poor outcomes associated with delays in care. The Committee recommended the measure, agreeing a gap in performance persists and that the measure addresses a high priority area. 2456: Medication Reconciliation: Number of Unintentional Medication Discrepancies per Patient (Brigham and Women's Hospital ): Recommended Description: This measure assesses the actual quality of the medication reconciliation process by identifying errors in admission and discharge medication orders due to problems with the medication reconciliation process. The target population is any hospitalized adul ; Measure Type: Outcome ; Level of Analysis: Facility ; Setting of Care: Hospital/Acute Care Facility ; Data Source: Electronic Clinical Data, Electroni c Clinical Data : Electronic Health Record, Healthcare Provider Survey, Other, Paper Medical Records, Patient Reported Data/Survey, Electronic Clinical Data : Pharmacy This measure was newly submitted to NQF and, while not currently in use, is anticipated to be implemented within 5-year s for use in accountability applications (a specific program was not identified). The Committee agreed the e vidence presented to support the measure was sufficient ; A systematic review was presented including 26 studies consistently demonstrating that medication reconciliation interventions result in a reduct ion in medication discrepancies, potential adverse drug events, adverse dru g events , and a reduction in health care utilization, however the studies were of fair qual ity, as graded by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). While the Committee agreed there is an opportunity for improvement, and the measure will have a high impact as a proxy outcome or short -term outcome of good care coordination arou nd medication, Committee members noted there is not a strong connection between the measure and long- term error reduction and overall better patient outcomes . The Committee recommended that further study to determine the long- term benefits of medication re conciliation interventions be presented . Committee membe rs also raised concerns about the feasibility of the measure, and the potential need for a study pharmacist to implement to measure , but ultimat ely agreed to recommend the measure. 0487: EHR with EDI prescribing used in encounters where a prescribing event occurred. (City of New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene ): Not Recommende d Description: Of all patient encounters within the past month that used an electronic health record (EHR) with electronic data interchange (EDI) where a prescribing event occurred, how many used EDI for the 18 prescribing event. ; Measure Type: Structure ; Level of Analysis: Clinician : Individual ; Setting of Care: Ambulatory Care : Clinician Office/Clinic ; Data Source: Electronic Clinical Data, Electronic Clinical Data : Electronic Health Record, Electronic Clinical Data : Pharmacy This measure has been NQF -endorsed since 2008 and is in use in the Primary Care Information Project , which is part of New York City Depart ment of Health & Mental Hygiene. Reviewing the evidence presented to support the measure, Committee members expressed doubt that measuring the num ber of electronic prescriptions will lead to meaningful conclusions about or improvements in quality of care. The developer presented studies displaying a high prevalence of medication errors, however the Committee pointed out that they do not show a clear link between the measure of the number of electronic prescriptions and health outcomes. As a result, t he Co mmittee agreed the evidence presented is insufficient to support the measure and that there is low confidence that the measure addresses a significant health problem. The Committee also agreed that while there do not appear to be potential harms associated with this measure, the potential benefits of this measure in improving the quality of care or patient outcomes are not clear, and the Committee did not recommend the measure. Measures withdrawn by the developer and were not considered. The following measu res were withdrawn during the measure evaluation period Measure Measure Steward Reason for withdrawal 0486: Adoption of Medication e - Prescribing Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Provider adopted a qualified e -Prescribing system and extent of use in the ambulatory setting was retired from the PQRS program at the end of 2008 and was absorbed by the Electronic Prescribing (e - RX) incentive program. 0488: Adoption of Health Information Technology Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Retired from P QRS program at the end of 2012 and absorbed into the Meaningful Use Program. 0489: The Ability for Providers with HIT to Receive Laboratory Data Electronically Directly into their Qualified/Certified EHR System as Discrete Searchable Data Elements Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services CMS was not able to provide the reliability and validity data required for re-endorsement. 19 0491: Tracking of Clinical Results Between Visits Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services CMS was not able to provide the reliability and validity data required for re-endorsement. 0493: Participation by a physician or other clinician in systematic clinical database registry that includes consensus endorsed quality measures Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services CMS was no t able to provide the reliability and validity data required for re-endorsement. 20 Reference s 1. \"Evidence on the Costs and Benefits of Health Information Technology,\" 2008, The Congressional Budget Office, May 2008, http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/91xx/doc9168/05 -20-healthit.pdf . 2.

Importance to Measure and Report: The measure meets the Importance criteria (1a. Evidence: 1b. Rationale : The Committee noted that the evidence presented to support the measure is based several articles and input from an expert panel. They expressed that expert opinion is not considered empirical evidence, and noted the lack of a systematic literature review, including a review of the quality, quantity and consistency of the evidence . Committee members also acknowledged the lack of evidence could be due to few of studies including rural health departments. The Committee agreed the evidence p resented to support the measure is insufficient, however, elected to exercise the exception to the evidence criterion, as the measure addresses a gap area, will have a high impact and the benefits of the measure outweighs potential harms. The Committee di scussed that in terms of performance gap, the measure is intended to fill a gap in performance measurement for emergency departments in rural hospitals transfer ring patients to other settings. Committee members agreed the measures will have a high impact due to the fact that transfer of comprehensive information is critical, especially for rural hospitals that do not have other healthcare facilities nearby. However, they expressed the need for measures to go further than assessing the transfer of patient i nformation. Committee members noted this measure and the other six related measures from University of 23 0291 Administrative Communication Minnesota are not stratified by race, gender or ethnicity. One Committee member articulated a desire to see disparities information. The developer explai ned that the measures are already disparity- sensitive as rural hospitals have a higher percentage of low -income and a higher percentage of elderly patients. 2. Scientific Acceptability of Measure Properties: The measure meets the Scientific Acceptability criteria (2a. Reliability - precise specifications, testing; 2b. Validity - testing, : For all the measures, the Committee agreed that reliability and validity testing were sufficient to meet the criteria. The developer performed in two field test with data from 2006, 2008, 2010 and data from 2012 - 2013 abstracted from paper records and EHRs. Approximately 75 rural hospitals are included in the initial rounds of testing and an additional 73 were included in the second rounds. Approximately 1500 patients were included in the first round of testing and details are not yet available for the second round of testing. o For field test one, for 68% of transfer reco rds, the hospital abstractors' findings agreed 100% with the QIO staff abstraction. And in a second test, 82.4% of transfer records, the hospitals' abstraction findings agreed 100% with the QIO staff abstraction. The developer explains the number of incons istencies in abstraction decreased by more than 50% from the first quarter to the second quarter. o For field test two, on -site inter -rater reliability was conducted shortly after the training. Sixty transfer records were abstracted and nearly all elements of all records matched the trainer's abstractions (statistics are not provided). The developer notes that clarification on admission dates and times was required. o The developer interprets these testing results to mean that initial understanding of elements was high, with little review, reinforcement or revision or clarification of the material indicated. o The measure's validity was determined through face validity and an expert panel used to demonstrate accord with professional standards . 3. Feasibility: H -10; M 3b. sources; and 3c. Data collection can be implemented (eMeasure feasibility assessment of data elements and logic) Rationale : The Committee discussed the potential administrative burden of the measures due to the need to use of multiple data sources (EHR, lab and paper) to report the measure. The developer explained that the records being transferred are relatively short and there have been no complaints from implementers about burden in th e implementation of this measure. 4. Use and Usability: H -7; M -12; L- - progress demonstrated; and 4c. Benefits outweigh evidence of unintended negative consequences) Rationale : A member of the Committee questioned how the measure has been used since prior endorsement. The 24 0291 Administrative Communication developer explained that as of January 2012, the state of Minnesota requires the submission of this data from all of its critical access hospitals. However, the developer does not have access to data due to privacy regulations. The Committee suggested that in future, the focus of this suite of measures could be expanded to include patients transferred to additional settings, such as home health. 5. Related and Competing Measure s The measure is related to other measures in the suite: 0292,0293, 0294, Y-16; N-6 The Steering Committee recommended this measure for endorsement acknowledging that while communicatio n may have occurred, it does not necessarily mean care coordination has occurred . However, the committee stated that these are small steps towards care coordination, since there are not many measures that encompass every aspect of care coordination. 6. Public and Member Comment 7.

Scientific Acceptability of Measure Properties: The measure meets the Scientific Acceptability criteria (2a. Reliability - precise spec ifications, testing; 2b. Validity - : The Committee discussed that the difference between this measure and 0291 was the content of the data being transferred with the patient . For all the measures, the Committee agreed that reliability and validity testing were sufficient to meet the criteria. 3. Feasibility: H -12; M -9; L- 3b. sources; and 3c. Data collection can be implemented (eMeasure feasibility assessment of data elements and logic) Rationale : The Committee discussed that data the measure would be easy to collect, and agreed feasibility for the measure is high. However, the C ommittee discussed that this is is measure assessing transfer s of data , instead of quality of care . 4. Use and H demonstrated; and 4c. Benefits outweigh evidence of uninten ded negative consequences) Rationale : The Committee agreed the measure will enhance quality and is being used in a variety of other projects. The developer explained that additional data is beginning to come in for this measure. 5.

Committee members discussed the importance of receiving a comprehensive medication list with a full history , and agreed the measure will have a high impact in terms of improving the coordination of care. 2. Scientific Acceptability of Measure Properties: The measure meets the Scientific Acceptability criteria (2a. Reliability - precise specifications, testing; 2b. Validity - testing, : For all the measures, the Committee agreed that reliability and validity testing were sufficient to meet the criteria. Committee members discussed that while this measure is specified for rural hospitals, it can be used for any facility even though it was originally developed to assess rural hospitals.

Importance to Measure and Report: The measure meets the Importance criteria (1a. Evidence, 1b. Performance Gap, : Committee members expressed concerns regarding the strength of the evidence presented linking Emergency Department (ED) stays and patient outcomes. o The devel oper explained that most EDs are experiencing overcrowding and that this can lead to ambulance refusals, prolonged waiting times and delays in care for patients. Reducing the time spent in the Emergency Department for admitted patients may also mean that patients receive the specific care that they need that cannot or should not be provided in the ED sooner. o According to studies cited by the developer, there is an overall link of ED stays with the outcomes of care. In particular, studies cited a link be tween longer ED stays and poor patient outcomes for specific conditions. Some Committee members noted that although this evidence significant, it could tend to reflect research interests. However, the Committee ultimately agreed the evidence presented is sufficient to support the measure. Committee members noted the trend data provided did not show improvement in performance on this measure since previous endorsement. According to the data provided, there was a difference of roughly 70 to 80 minutes in median time from ED arrival to ED departure for admitted patients, when comparing the top 10 percent with the national median. Additionally, there is no evidence of disparities in ED crowding. o The developer noted that the eviden ce clearly shows wide variation in ED wait times with room for improvement. While the data provided does not show improvement over time, that data was collected over a relatively short time window (15 months). It was suggested that examining trends over a longer period of time would show more variability in ED length of stay, although not necessarily improvement. Committee members agreed that this measure may help motivate improvements and potentially avoid long- term declines in performance. It addresse s a high priority area and could also be an important tool for evaluating changes associated with implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). As more and more patients are admitted through the ED, timeliness of care within the ED will take on greater importance in determining overall timeliness of care for admitted patients . 35 0495 Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Admitted ED Patients 2. Scientific Acceptability of Measure Properties: The measure meets the Scientific Acceptability criteria (2a. Reliability - precise specifications, testing; 2b. Validity - testing, : Committee members agreed that the specifications provided were clear and precise, making the measure adequate for consistent implementation. The Committee dis cussed that r eliability testing was not needed because validity testing had been done at the critical data element level with good results, indicating the validity of the measure. o The developer explained that there were two data elements, \"decision to ad mit time\" and \"ED departure time\" with slightly lower agreement rates (63.29 and 76.79% respectively), due to the nature of testing time related elements, which are more prone to mismatch. The ICC statistics for these elements were very high when those tim e values were grouped in intervals rather than as single discreet points. Some Committee members conveyed uncertainity about the low kappa statistic for the dat a element \"observation services\" but noted there was a high agreement rate . o The developer exp lained that the definition of the element had been recently updated to ease abstraction from medical charts. However the impact of that change has been investigated empirically. o Committee members noted that the strong kappa statistics for the arrival and departure time elements suggests that this is not a substantial concern, but only if the time stamps used as the gold standard comparison were a reflection of real care processes and not just an artifact of administrative processes. Committee members noted that the measure is not risk adjusted to account for severity of illness, and that more acute patients may require specialized care, which may not be readily available for ED admitted patients. However, the Committee ultimately agreed the validity of the measure is demonstrated. 3. Feasibility: H -12; M -7; L- 0; I-0 3b.

Committee members agreed that this measure would be an important tool in monitoring impacts of changes in health care coverage and insurance policies. 36 0495 Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Admitted ED Patients Committee members suggested that it is unclear how th e performance results can be used to further the goal of high -quality, efficient healthcare. The data provided displayed no improvement and the developer notes that this trend may continue due to other factors (such as the expansion of state Medicaid prog rams). However, there do not appear to be any unintended consequences associated with the measure. 5. Related and Competing Measures No related or competing measures noted.

Importance to Measure and Report: The measure meets the Importance criteria (1a. Evidence, 1b. Performance Gap, : While Committee members agreed this measure is important, they were concerned that improvement was not shown for the data presented over 5 quarter in 2012 to 2013. Committee members found the evidence presented to support the measure compelling, and note d that there is room for improvement on the measure. Committee members reasoned that if performance is stagnating or declining, that argues for the continued importance of this measure to monitor trends and motivate further change. 37 0496 Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Discharged ED Patients o The developer explained that although there have not been significant improvements within the metrics; there are areas of within coordination of services on the inpatient side that show improvement. The developer is working closely with the Emergency Department Benchmarking Alliance to standardize these metrics across all settings and include electronic medical records. They do also recognize this measure is somewhat dependent on Emergency Department volume. CMS, as the steward, has made the decision at least for the public displ ay of the data, to start stratifying this performance measure by total Emergency Department annual volume, which will eventually capture a better picture of how hospitals are moving performance over time. This measure was identified as targeting the issu e of the need to better examine/move populations through the emergency room. Committee members noted that this measure is and especially a high priority during the ACA implementation, and these are all key priority areas as we move into the new redesigned healthcare system. o The developer noted that the ED volume has increased between 2011 and 2012 by 3 percent to 5 percent and the acuity has increased with over 68 percent of the hospital admissions being processed through the ED. This further supports the importance of this group of patients in terms of whether there is a potential health problem. While the Committee agreed the measure will have a high impact, Committee members noted that additional comments were made during the workgroup call as to whethe r this should be a process measure focused on efficiency rather than an outcome measure. 2.

Importance to Measure and Report: The measure meets the Importance criteria (1a. Evidence, 1b. Decision Time to ED Departure Time for Admitted Patients Rationale : Committee members agreed that this measure speaks more directly to care coordination than 0495 and 0496, as it focuses on the time from decision to admit to actual patient discharge from the ED. The Committee noted the measure emphasizes the logistical aspects of care that occur after initial evaluation. Although Committee members noted the literature cited in support of the measure does not appear to specifically address this narrow window f rom decision to departure, the Committee agreed the evidence presented supports the importance of timely care and poor outcomes associated with delays in care. Committee members noted the lack of significant improvement in performance on the measure since prior endorsement. o The developer explained that although there have not been significant improvements within the metrics; there are areas of coordination of services on the inpatient side that show improvement.

Impo rtance to Measure and Report: The measure meets the Importance criteria (1a. Evidence, 1b. Performance Gap, Co mmittee agreed the e vidence presented provided moderate support for the measure focus. The evidence included a systematic review consisting of 26 studies consistently demonstrating that medication reconciliation interventions result in a reduction in medication discrepancies (17/17 studies), potential adverse drug events (5/6), adverse drug events (2/2), and reduction in health care utilization (2/8 studies), however the studies were of fair quality, as graded by the United States Preventive Services Task F orce (USPSTF). While the Committee viewed this measure as a proxy outcome f or a short -term outcome of good care coordination around medication, they did not find a strong connection between the measure and long -term error reduction and overall better patient outcomes . The Committee recommended further study to determine the long -term benefits of medication reconciliation interventions. The Committee concluded there is a gap in performance as the rate of unintentional medication discrepancies per pati ent is high and there is variation by site, with 2.78 to 4.57 discrepancies per patient (average of 3.44 per patient), making medication reconciliation errors the single biggest source of medication errors in the hospital (i.e., as opposed to errors in pre scribing, transcribing, or administration). The Committee agreed the measure will have a high impact, as n ationwide 10 percent to 67 percent of inpatients have at least one unexplained discrepancy in their prescription medication history at the time of ad mission; 25 percent to 71 percent have at least one medication error at discharge. Reasons for medication discrepancies among hospitalized patients are primarily: 1) \"history errors,\" errors in taking or documenting the patient's preadmission medication hi story, and 2) \"reconciliation errors,\" errors of reconciling the medication history with medication orders. In addition, a pproximately 70 percent of potentially harmful discrepancies are due to history errors, usually errors of omission resulting from not documenting that a patient was taking a medication prior to admission. 2. Scientific Acceptability of Measure Properties: The measure meets the Scientific Acceptability criteria (2a. Reliability - precise specifications, testing; 2b. Validity - testing, : The Committee determined that the measure specifications were reliable and valid, noting that all codes necessary to calculate the measure wer e present and the specifications were consistent with the evidence presented, however, suggested for future development the developer move past just listing medications and focus on appropriate usage. The Committee expressed concerns regarding the small s ample size used in the testing and lack of risk adjustment done in the reliability testing. The developer explained they did take these factors into consideration but ultimately favored feasibility over reliability. Requiring extra data collection and addi ng to the regular work flow may cause too high of a burden on providers. The developer further explained 42 2456 Medication Reconciliation: Number of Unintentional Medication Discrepancies per Patient that many training precautions were taken to assure that pharmacists at different hospitals were implementing the same process. The Committee accepted the developer's explanation and agreed that while the sample size was small, the reliability testing results are acceptable. Committee members agreed the measure is valid, noting validity testing was performed at the performance measure score with a syst ematic assessment of face validity indicated : literature is cited to support that the process of pharmacists taking pre -administration medication histories is a proxy for a gold -standard medication history. 3. Feasibility: H -1; M -10; L- 5; I-1 (3a. delivery; 3b. Electronic sources; 3c.Susceptibility to inaccuracies/ unintended consequences identified 3d. Data collection strategy can be implemented) Rationale : While the Committee agreed the measure is feasible by a slim margin, members were unable to come to true consensus. Many members voiced concerns about the amount of extra resources required to gather the gold standard data. Several Committee members stated that the measurement burden is considerable, requiring a pharmacist trained in the measure protocol to spend time (1) creating a gold standard medication list (2) comparing the list to admission orders and (3) comparing the gold standard to discharge orders. That me ans actions on at least 2 different days (admission day and discharge day). In addition, c reating the gold standard list will require going to several sources, including speaking with the patient or family, and potentially reaching out to providers outside the hospital. Committee memners noted that this level of pharmacist involvement is not routine at most hospitals. Even at facilities where a pharmacist -generated gold standard list is a part of routine care, taking the time to compare that list to the adm ission and discharge orders and use the measure protocol to calculate a score is still a considerable measurement burden. The Committee did , however, consider whether the benefits of a substantive medication reconciliation measure outweigh this considerab le measurement burden and agreed with the measure steward that this measure is a tremendous step forward in assessing the true quality of medication reconciliation, rather than relying on a \"check -the-box\" measure. 4.

Importance to Measure and Report: The measure meets the Importance criteria (1a. Evidence: 1b. While the Committee noted that electroni c prescribing is becoming more common, potentially leading to fewer errors in dispensing than handwritten prescriptions, they agreed it is not clear that measuring the number of electronic prescriptions alone will lead to any meaningful conclusions about o r improvements in quality of care. Although the developer cited several studies displaying a high prevalence of medication errors, the Committee pointed out that they do not show a clear link between the measure of the number of electronic prescription a nd health outcomes. Committee members encouraged the developer to provide more recent data and evidence to support measure focus given the rapid changes in the use of electronic health records in the United States. The Committee agreed the evidence presented was insufficient to support the measure and that there is low confidence that the measure addresses a significant health problem. The Committee also agreed that while there do not appear to be any potential harms associated with this measure, the potential benefits of this measure in improving the quality of care or patient outcomes are 44 0487 EHR with EDI prescribing used in encounters where a prescribing event occurred not clear , and did not recommend the measure. 2.

The target population is any hospitalized adult patient. The time frame is the hospitalization period. At the time of admission, the admission orders are compared to the preadmission medication list (PAML) compiled by trained pharmacist (i.e., the gold standard) to look for discrepancies and identify which discrepancies were unintentional using brief medical record review. This process is repeated at the time of di scharge where the discharge medication list is compared to the PAML and medications ordered during the hospitalization. Percentage of patients aged 18 years and older discharged from any inpatient facility (e.g. hospital, skilled nursing facility, or rehab ilitation facility) and seen within 30 days of discharge in the office by the physician, prescribing practitioner, registered nurse, or clinical pharmacist who had reconciliation of the discharge medications with the current medication list in the outpatie nt medical record documented. This measure is reported as two rates stratified by age group: 18 -64 and 65+.

The resulting preadmission medication list is then compared with the medi cal team's documented preadmission medication list and with all admission and discharge medication orders. Any discrepancies between the gold - standard history and medication orders are identified and reasons for these changes sought from the medical record . Pharmacists may also need to communicate directly with the medical team to clarify reasons for discrepancies, as needed. Medication discrepancies that are not clearly intentional are then recorded, along with the reason for the discrepancy: 1. History error: the order is incorrect because the medical team's preadmission medication list is incorrect (e.g., the team did not know the patient was taking aspirin prior to admission, does not record it in the preadmission medication list, and therefore does not order it at admission) 2. Reconciliation error: the medical team's preadmission medication list is correct, but there is still an error in the orders. For within 30 days of discharge. - See corresponding Excel document for the Medication Reconciliation Value Set --- MEDICAL RECORD Documentation in the medical record must include evidence of medication reconciliation, and the date on wh ich it was performed.

For EHR: This measure does not lend itself to a \"traditional specification\" for EHR reporting, where data elements, logic and clinical coding are identified to calculate the measure, due to the fact that every facility may have a different template for medication reconciliation and the information required for this measure is based on individualized patient information unique to one episode of care (ie, inpatient stay). We have provided guidance on how a facility should query the electronic health record for the information required for this measure. Producing the Reconciled Medication List Facilities that have implemented an EHR system should utilize their system to develop a standardized template for the Reconciled Medic ation List. A standardized template will ensure that all required data elements specified in 73 2456 Medication Reconciliation: Number of Unintentional Medication Discrepancies per Patient Medication Reconciliation 0554 Medication Reconciliation Post -Discharge (MRP) 0553 Care for Older Adults (COA) - Medication Review 0419 Documentation of Current Medications in the Medical Record 0646 Reconciled Medication List Received by Discharged P atients (Discharges from an Inpatient Facility to Home/Self Care or Any Other Site of Care) example, the team knew the patient was taking aspirin prior to admission and documents it in the preadmission medication list. The team decides to hold the aspirin on admission for a clinical reason such as bleeding, but the team forgets to restart the aspirin at discharge. The admission discrepancy would be considered intentional (no error, not coun ted in the numerator), but the discharge discrepancy would be counted as a reconciliation error. The type of error should also be recorded: omission, discrepancy in dose, route, frequency, or formulation, or an additional medication. Lastly, the time of th e error should be recorded: admission vs. discharge. Only documentation in the outpatient chart meets the intent of the measure, but an in -person, outpatient visit is not required furnished no later than the date of the face -to-face visit. --- MEDICAL RECORD Documentation must come from the same medical record and must include the followin g: A medication list in the medical record, AND evidence of a medication review by a prescribing practitioner or clinical pharmacist and the date when it was performed Notation that the patient is not taking any medication and the date when it was noted A review of side effects for a single medication at the time of prescription alone is not sufficient. An outpatient visit is not required to meet criteria. Prescribing practitioner is defined as a practitioner with prescribing privileges, including nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other non -MDs who have the authority to prescribe medications. the measure are included whenever a Reconciled Medication List is generated from the EHR. Each facility has the autonomy to customize the format of the Reconciled Medication List, based on clinical workflow, policies and procedures, and the patient population treated at the individual institution. Systematic External Reporting that the Reconciled Medication List was provided to patient In order to report, at the f acility level, which of the discharged patients have received a Reconciled Medication List, a discrete data field and code indicating the patient received a reconciled medication list at discharge may be needed in the EHR. Each facility should determine t he most effective way to identify whether or not the patient received the reconciled medication list. Transmitting the Reconciled Medication List This performance measure does not require that the Reconciled Medication List be transmitted to the next provider(s) of care. However, if it is transmitted to the next provider(s) of care, it should be done so in accordance with established approved 74 2456 Medication Reconciliation: Number of Unintentional Medication Discrepancies per Patient Medication Reconciliation 0554 Medication Reconciliation Post -Discharge (MRP) 0553 Care for Older Adults (COA) - Medication Review 0419 Documentation of Current Medications in the Medical Record 0646 Reconciled Medication List Received by Discharged P atients (Discharges from an Inpatient Facility to Home/Self Care or Any Other Site of Care) standa rds for interoperability. The ONC Health IT Standards Committee (HITSC) has recommended that certain vocabulary standards are used for quality measure reporting, in accordance with the Quality Data Model, developed by the National Quality Forum. RxNorm has been named as the recommended vocabulary for medications and can be used to identify the medications to which the allergies exist. Allergies (non -substance) and Adverse Events to medications should be expressed using SNOMED -CT. The use of industry standa rds for the transmission of the Reconciled Medication List information will ensure that the information can be received into the destination EHR. For Claims/Administrative: Numerator Action to be identified through medical record abstraction: See Sample Data Collection Tool attached. Denominator Statement The patient denominator includes a random sample of all potential adults admitted to the hospital. Our recommendation is that 25 patients are sampled per month, or approximately 1 patient per weekday. So, for example, if among those 25 patients, 75 unintentional All patients aged 18 years and older discharged from any inpatient facility (e.g. hospital, skilled nursing facility, or rehabilitation facility) and seen within 30 days following discharge in the office by the physician, prescribing practitioner, registered nurse, Patients who are 66 years and older as of the end of the measurement year with an acute or nonacute inpatient discharge during the first 11 months of the measurement year (e.g., January 1 to December 1).

ADMINISTRATIVE An acute or nonacute inpatient discharge during the first 11 months of the measurement year (e.g., January 1 to December 1). The denominator is based on episodes, not patients. Patients may appear more than once in the denominator. If patients have more than one discharge, include all discharges during the first 11 months of the measurement year. If the discharge is followed by a readmission or direct transfer to an acute or non -acute facility within the 30 -day follow -up period, count the only the readmission discharge or the discharge from the facility to which the patient was transferred. Exclude both the initial discharge and the readmission/direct transfer discharge if the readmission/direct transfer discharge occurs after the first 11 months of the measurement year (e.g., December 1). --- Use administrative data to identify all patients 66 years and older as of the end of the measurement year. For the purposes of defining the denominator, the Performance Denominator(PD) is defined by the patient's age, encounter date, denominator CPT or HCPCS codes and the provider reported numerator HCPCS c odes described below (G8427, G8430 & G8428).
