However, no real-world data are available on this population. Methods: We compared the period prevalence (March-May 2020) and symptom presentation of COVID-19 infections between a sample of individuals with severe ASD (n = 36) and the staff personnel (n = 35) of two specialized centers. Anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibody positivity was used as a proxy of infection. Additionally, we evaluated vaccine side effects in the same groups. Results: No significant difference was found between the prevalence of COVID-19 positivity between autistic participants and staff personnel. Levels of antibodies against the spike protein and the receptor binding domain were not significantly different between autistic and staff participants. The level of antibodies against the N-terminal domain were higher in autistic individuals. There was a significant difference between the prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 in autistic participants (9.1%) compared to staff personnel (92.3%). The most frequent side effect among autistic participants was light fever. Conclusions: The present study provides preliminary data on COVID-19 transmission and presentation in ASD. Our data do not support the hypothesis of a higher susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 in people with ASD.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-06-28", "cleaned_text": "A Pilot Study on Covid and Autism: Prevalence, Clinical Presentation and Vaccine Side Effects [https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11070860](https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11070860) [1](#B1-brainsci-11-00860)]. Additionally, ASD has been proposed as a potential risk factor for the development of COVID-19 infections. In fact, autistic individuals, especially in the presence of a comorbid intellectual disability (ID), may experience difficulties in maintaining social distancing and in using personal protective equipment (PPE) correctly due to sensory difficulties. Moreover, literature data point out that autistic people are more prone to both bacterial and viral infections [ [2](#B2-brainsci-11-00860)]. Specific ASD pathophysiological mechanisms have been advocated as potential risk factors for COVID-19 [ [3](#B3-brainsci-11-00860)]. First, the presence of an altered immune response, characterized by an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and impairment in cellular-mediated response, has been frequently reported in ASD [ [4](#B4-brainsci-11-00860), [5](#B5-brainsci-11-00860), [6](#B6-brainsci-11-00860)]. Second, atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, frequently prescribed to treat irritability in ASD [ [7](#B7-brainsci-11-00860)], have been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects and disrupt both innate and adaptive immune responses [ [8](#B8-brainsci-11-00860)] and thus represent an adjunctive risk factor for COVID-19 in the autistic population. Third, six genes previously associated with ASD have been demonstrated to be differentially regulated in individuals with severe COVID-19 [ [9](#B9-brainsci-11-00860)]. Finally, several ASD individuals showed melatonin deficiency or alteration in the melatonin genes: as the melatonin system acts both as an immune regulator and an oxidant scavenger, impairment in this system has been hypothesized to impact COVID-19 susceptibility in autistic people [ [10](#B10-brainsci-11-00860)]. Despite these premises, real-world data on COVID-19 prevalence among autistic individuals are lacking. To our knowledge, only two papers have been published on the topic: the first one was a case report describing a high viral load in an autistic child suffering from COVID-19 in a residential facility [ [11](#B11-brainsci-11-00860)]; the second case series considered the characteristics of infection among autistic residents of a neuropsychiatric facility which was transformed into a COVID-19 ward and did not provide data on COVID-19 infections in a control group, such as staff personnel [ [12](#B12-brainsci-11-00860)]. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Setting 2.2. Procedures [Figure 1](#brainsci-11-00860-f001). 2.3. Blood Sampling and Detection of Antibodies Levels [13](#B13-brainsci-11-00860)]. The pCAGGS plasmids Spike (#NR_52310) were obtained from BEI Resources (NY, USA). Serum was tested for the presence of IgA and IgG against the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by means of the ELISA-based assay as described in Bruni et al. [ [14](#B14-brainsci-11-00860)]. The method has excellent specificity (86%) and sensitivity (97%) for IgGs and proved suitable for the detection of anti- SARS-CoV-2 IgAs with excellent sensitivity and specificity as well. Briefly, the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD was diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS tablets E404-200TABS, VWR) at a final concentration of 2 \u00b5g/mL, and 50 \u00b5L of solution was used to coat 96-well plates (Nunc MaxiSorp flat-bottom, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The day after, the coating solution was removed, and the plates were washed thrice with 200 \u00b5L of 0.1% of Tween-20 (Sigma, Kawasaki, Japan, P1379) in PBS (hereafter, called PBST). A total of 200 \u00b5L of 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma, Kawasaki, Japan, A7030) diluted in PBS (blocking solution) was added to each well for at least 1 h at room temperature. In the meantime, samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature and then diluted 1:50 and 1:200 with 1% BSA in PBST (hereafter, reagent solution). After 1 h of incubation, the blocking solution was removed and the plates washed as described above, then 50 \u00b5L of the diluted samples was plated and incubated for 1\u00bd-2 h at room temperature. After the incubation step, the plates were again washed, and 50 \u00b5L of a 1:3000 dilution (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA, clone Poly24110), both prepared in reagent solution, was added to the plate and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Next, the plates were washed and 50 \u00b5L of tetramethylbenzidine substrate reagent (Sigma, Kawasaki, Japan, T0440, ready to use) was added. The reaction was stopped after 10 min with 50 \u00b5L H2SO4 1N and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm in a Glomax plate reader. According to Bruni et al. [ [14](#B14-brainsci-11-00860)], the threshold lines for IgG and IgA were set as 0.277 and 0.295, respectively. [15](#B15-brainsci-11-00860)], as well as antigen cloning, production, and purification. 2.4. Questionnaires [16](#B16-brainsci-11-00860)] for adverse events was completed for each participant. 2.5. Statistical Analysis 3. Results [Table 1](#brainsci-11-00860-t001). Fourteen autistic individuals in the daycare center and 22 in the farm community agreed to participate. Eighteen staff subjects agreed to participate in the determination of IgG and IgA antibodies (n = 10 for the daycare center and n = 8 for the farm community), while all agreed (n = 11 for the daycare center and n = 24 for the farm community) to report about COVID-19 positivity (NHS measurement), symptoms, and vaccine side effects. 3.1. Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 Infection [Figure 2](#brainsci-11-00860-f002)) and IgA positivity (Chi-square = 0.60, p = 0.44). Levels of antibodies were generally low in the analyzed samples (LogEC50 below 3). In particular, antibodies against the spike protein and the RBD were not significantly different between autistic and staff participants (U = 25, p = 0.49; U = 27, p = 0.63, respectively). Level of antibodies against the NTD domain were significantly different between autistic participants and staff personnel (U = 16, p = 0.05), being higher in autistic individuals. No significant difference in NHS COVID-19 positivity was detected between participants taking antipsychotics or not (Chi-square = 0.01, p = 0.9). 3.2. Clinical Presentation 3.3. Vaccine Side Effects 4. Discussion [3](#B3-brainsci-11-00860), [10](#B10-brainsci-11-00860)], we did not observe a higher rate of infection among ASD subjects compared to staff personnel. Although the difference in total prevalence rate was not statistically significant, in the daycare center almost all of the staff acquired the infection at the beginning of the pandemic, as detected through antibody positivity and consistent with symptom development; meanwhile, less than half of the autistic subjects had antibody positivity to SARS-CoV-2. This result may be explained by the inability of autistic subjects to produce specific IgG antibodies or, alternatively, may indicate a natural resistance to the acquisition of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, in the farm community the number of infected autistic individuals was very low considering that patients were unable to wear PPE and prone to be in close proximity to each other, as happens in every household. Moreover, the younger age of autistic patients should have conferred a higher susceptibility [ [17](#B17-brainsci-11-00860)]. [18](#B18-brainsci-11-00860)]. However, the low rate of infection together with a silent clinical presentation could at least raise the hypothesis that ASD may provide a sort of protection against the acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection, instead of an additional risk. This is in contrast with the higher rate of infection usually observed in this patient population. It could be hypothesized that early and frequent infections [ [2](#B2-brainsci-11-00860)], such as influenza and the common cold, could have primed the immune system to have a more adequate response to a novel viral threat. Additionally, it has been hypothesized that the presence of higher levels of interferon-gamma, displayed by ASD subjects [ [19](#B19-brainsci-11-00860)], could be protective against COVID-19 [ [20](#B20-brainsci-11-00860)]. Furthermore, the presence of a pro-inflammatory status [ [21](#B21-brainsci-11-00860), [22](#B22-brainsci-11-00860)] in ASD could be protective against the cytokine storm which is believed to determine severe COVID-19 symptoms [ [23](#B23-brainsci-11-00860)]. Our results are in line with a recent pre-print meta-analysis [ [24](#B24-brainsci-11-00860)] which did not observe an increased mortality or risk for severe COVID-19 in patients with developmental disabilities. [25](#B25-brainsci-11-00860)], are still extremely reluctant to provide consent for vaccination. In our sample, three subjects did not receive a COVID-19 vaccine due to consent denial from the parents. Additionally, prioritizing vaccination in people with severe mental illness is both a health and political issue [ [26](#B26-brainsci-11-00860), [27](#B27-brainsci-11-00860)], and in Italy vaccination for people with mental disorders has been scattered and unequal between different regions. [17](#B17-brainsci-11-00860)]. Finally, as our sample was composed of people with severe ASD and associated ID, we cannot generalize our findings to the higher-functioning part of the spectrum. 5.
