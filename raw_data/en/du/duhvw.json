Triphala for Weight Loss (Obesity) Triphala is a simple preparation, but it gives awesome benefits in weight loss. It reduces visceral fat and cellulite. How does Triphala work in Weight loss (Obesity)? Triphala has effects on fat metabolism. It increases fat burning by rectifying the metabolism in the body. In obese people, bones are weak because the metabolism of fat is not correct, according to ayurvedic science. According to [ayurveda](/what-is-ayurveda/), there are mainly seven types [DHATUs](/sapta-dhatu-in-ayurveda/) (Tissues) in the body, which are simultaneously responsible for making next DHATU. For example, RASA DHATU the formation of ASTHI DHATU takes place. According to this concept, there is a problem in metabolism of MAMSA DHATU to MEDHA DHATU and MEDHA DHATU to ASTHI DHATU, which ultimately cause accumulation of the fat in the body and makes your bones weaker. According to recent studies, obese people have weak bones, which supports ayurvedic concept of weaker bones on obese people. Triphala rectifies this cycle of metabolism in the body, so it reduces body weight. Its use also makes bones stronger and increases bone mineral density in obese people. Therefore, according to practical observation, the concept of ayurveda regarding DHATU metabolism is correct. We also found weaker bones and low bone mineral density in people with obesity. Treating with Triphala reduces belly (abdominal) fat as well as increases bone mineral density.
