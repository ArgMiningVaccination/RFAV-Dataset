Introduction Personal Note and Outline of the Structure of This Article .W e were a family with 5 children. Our parents and our familyphysician treated feverish illnesses with the greatest respectand always managed to make us feel safe and comfortablewithout suppressing the fever. None of us ever received anantipyretic (nor for that matter an antibiotic, except for the postnatal pneumonia of a prematurely born brother). The uncritical and widespread use of antipyretics and antibioticsI witnessed as a student and physician therefore seemed astrange and unphysiological interruption of a natural and,from my experience, healthy process. Our physician wasan anthroposophist, so I began to enquire: What is anthro-posophic medicine? What are its main statements aboutfever?Dothesestatementshaveanyscientificbasis?Thefirstquestion will be addressed in Introduction; the results ofthe second question are presented in Results as statements.Discussionpicksupeachofthesestatementsandrelatesthemtocurrentscientificliterature.In their 2016 editorial \"Fever Phobia 35 Years Later: Did WeFail?\"[1],Bertilleetal.wonderwhyithasbeensodifficult to inform the world population about how to think of, and dealwith,fever.Theysummarize\"largestudiesseemtoindi- cate that fever phobia persists and antipyretic drugs are still overused [2-4].

These studies areintroducedintherespectiveplacesinSection4. 4. Discussion The discussion is structured around the anthroposophicperspectives on fever as they are stated in thirteen resultingstatementslistedinSection3. (1)The leading motif in anthroposophic medicine is that warmthand,indiesease,feveraredirectmanifestations ofthe\"self\"workingonthebody,makingthebodymorean instrument and expression of the \"ego,\" the \"I\" (InGerman\"dasIch\")[19-22,25-27]. This is a notion specific to anthroposophy. It is related to the whole breadth and depth of what human warmthis and can be, including social life and human will, andthe increasingly autonomous and differentiated relationshipthatanimalshavehadtowarmththroughoutevolution.Thist o p icg o n .I ti s,h o w ev er ,worthmentioningthathuman\"warmth,\"themostpowerful personality trait in social judgment, is enhanced by physical warmth[43,44].

The subsequent entry into secondaryschoolwasunproblematic[26].4 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine The positive attitude of anthroposophic physicians with regard to fever has support from the evolutionary point ofview.Feverisahighlyconservedevolutionaryhostresponsewithsurvivalandsalutarybenefit.Feverisonecomponentoft h ea c u t ep h a s er e s p o n s e ,w h i c hi sac o m p l e xp h y s i o l o g i c a lreaction to disease or injury, and elicits cytokine mediated riseincoretemperature,generationofacutephasereactants, and activation of a endocrinologic,and immunological energy-costly (10-12.5% increasein metabolic rate for 1 C increase in body temperature in warm-bloodedanimals[46]),itisanestablishedmechanismin response to injury and infection in fish, amphibians,reptiles,birdsandmammals,andmanyinvertebratessuchasinsects [47]. Even cold-blooded animals seek external waysof increasing their body temperature when they are infectedand their mortality increases if they are prevented fromdoing so [48]. Studies point to potentially harmful effects ofsuppressing fever in mammals and humans [16, 49-52]. Theprotective effects of fever against invading organisms resultfrom a variable combination of direct thermic effects [53]and humoral [54] and cellular [55] defense enhancement.Withfewexceptions[53],fromthepointofviewofimmunityand survival, fever offers the host an adaptive advantage[56]. Human studies on malaria [51], chicken pox with community-acquired pneumonia wereseven times more likely to die if they did not display fever and leukocytosis [59]. There are several reports of treating Sydenham'sChoreabyinducingfever[60,61]. But if fever really were so important, would we not have g e n e t i cm o d e l so fa n i m a l so rh u m a n sw h oa r eu n a b l et op r od ucef ev era ndha v ew o rseo u tco mes?Ther ema ybesuchmodels on the horizon: In a study showing that early andstrongimmuneresponsesareassociatedwithcontrolofviralreplicationandrecoveryinLassavirus-infectedCynomolgusmonkeys, the authors noted absence of significant fever innonsurvivors despite high levels of IL-6 [62].

The improved immune function during febrile temper- atures has to be weighed up against metabolic costs andpotential damage to sensitive organs such as the brain,possiblythefetus[31,32],and,inmiceinfectedwith Klebsiella pneumoniae ,thelung[33].Thus,insomecases,hypothermia orsuppressionoffevermayreducemortality,eventhoughitincreases bacterial load [34]. Nevertheless, weighing up the prosandcontrasleadstotheconclusionthat,foracutefebrile infections under normal circumstances, it is better to notsuppress the fever [42]. A very large recent study has shownthat, even on the ICU unit, suppressing fever does not seemtoconveyanadvantagetothepatient[65].(3)\"Fevermay preventrecurrentinfection\"[19-22,26].

Inanalogytothelossofmemoryperformancewhensleep isdisturbed,AMproposesthatinterruptingthefeverphasesmay impair disease resolution and long-term immunity.Anthroposophic physicians report that patients, especiallychildren, often stop having recurrent infections after experi-encing an acute febrile illness without use of antipyretics orantibiotics[19-22],althoughstudiestothisregardarelacking.Conversely, there is evidence that the use of paracetamolin conjunction with vaccination can lead to less fever andreducedantibodyresponse[66].

(5)\"Fevermayprotectagainstdevelopingallergicdiseases\" [7,19-22,26]. (6)\"Fevermayhelpresolveallergicdisease\"[7,19-22,26]. Thesearetopicsthatdeservefutureresearch.Thereiscon- troversialevidencethatuseofacetaminopheninthefirstyearof life and in later childhood is associated with an increasedrisk of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema in childrenand adults [69, 70]. However, this may be more linked to acetaminophenitselfthantosuppressingfever,sinceprenatal exposuretoacetaminophenpredictedwheezeatageof5yearsin an inner-city minority cohort, and the risk was modifiedbyafunctionalpolymorphisminGSTP1,suggestingamech-anism involving the glutathione pathway [71]. Furthermore,use of ibuprofen seems to cause less increase in asthmamorbidity than use of acetaminophen [72]. Nevertheless, ani n v e r s er e l a t i o n s h i pb e t w e e nf e b r i l ed i s e a s e si ne a r l yc h i l d -hood life and allergy has been found in most studies [73-75] (one study shows a positive correlation [76] but did notcontrol for antipyretic use), despite the fact that antipyretic[69-72]andantibiotic[75]treatmentoffebrileinfectionsmayincreasetheriskofasthma.Thelowerrateofatopyinyoungersiblings further suggests that cross-infections acquired earlyininfancyorchildhoodmightpreventdevelopmentofatopy[77].Childrenwhoareraisedinananthroposophiclifestyle,which includes very restricted use of antipyretics, show lessallergies[7].

Biographicalaccountsoftheroleofacutefebrileillnesses in facilitating developmental steps and helping to find newindividual creativity are aspects of fever that have yet tobecome subject to scientific investigation. Johann W. vonGoethe, for example, suffered several severe acute febrileillnesses and felt he came through each time with newimpulses [81]. Laurens van der Post has written stunningwords about his experience of fever and of its relationshipwithtranspersonalpastandfuture,forexample, \"AllIwould suggest is that the future had begun to register a new designin my blood, and that the fever marked the beginnings ofits struggle for awareness\" [82]. In anthroposophic medical practice, these considerations are part of promoting the bestpossibleoutcome.Manyanthroposophicorientedcaregivers,parents, and teachers believe and seem to have often expe-rienced [19, 20, 22, 23, 26-28] that febrile illnesses offer achild the chance to optimize the process of making theirbody a better expression of their \"true self.\" It would beinteresting to study how the catabolic activity of fever andthe anabolic convalescence that follows it promote humandevelopment.Weknowthatotherkindsofcatabolicactivity,such as enthusiastic physical, musical, artistic, and mentalexerciseandwork,dosowhentheyarefelttobemeaningfuland are properly balanced by anabolic phases of nutrition, rest, and sleep. Such thoughts certainly help many parents a n dp a t i e n t sg ot h r o u g ht h ep r o c e s so fa ni l l n e s sw i t hapositive attitude and many interesting observations havebeen collected [19, 20, 22, 23, 26-29]. Indeed, in a studyof 1001 children with measles, of whom 886 children werestudiedprospectively,74%ofchildrenwerejudgedashavingprofited from having measles, and 97% of parents whosechildren had measles said they would, in hindsight, againdecide to not vaccinate their children against measles. Incontrast only, 2.4% would rather have vaccinated them and0.5% of children developed measles despite having beenvaccinated [23]. However, this study may be biased by theparents potentially having a critical stance to vaccination:a recent study using population-level data suggests that measles may be followed by long-lasting immunodeficiencyforabout2years,correlatingwithanincreaseinnonmeaslesrelated mortality during this time and perhaps explainingthe disproportionately large reductions in mortality seenafter the introduction of measles vaccination [41]. No such associationswerefoundforpertussisorpertussisvaccination and the author is not aware of such studies for other acuteinfectious diseases. Future studies on the effects of variousfeverish illnesses on individual development would thus beneededtoanswerthesequestions.

From an anthroposophic point of view, many illnesses canbeassessed intermsoftheirrelationshiptothe\"inflam-matory\" and \"hardening\" poles: childhood cancers such asleukemias and embryonic tumors are more related to the\"inflammation\"polewhereasthecommonsolidtumorsofthe adult develop in a more \"hardening\" context.

These \"hardening\" processes can trigger moreor less helpful \"inflammatory\" counterregulations. Whilechronic inflammation can lead to sclerosis and cancer [86],there is evidence to suggest that acute febrile inflammationsin children and young adults could be protective againstcancerdevelopmentinlaterlife[87].Cancerpatientsreportahistoryoffewerfeversduringinfectionsthanhealthycontrols[88, 89]. An inverse relationship between the number of6 febrile infections and the incidence of melanoma hasbeenreported[90].Takingtheseconceptsintotheanimalworld, it is interesting to note that animals with hardly any\"hardening\" or aging tendencies and with a strong ability torebuildlostlimbs,suchashydra,hardlyeverdevelopcancer[ 9 1 ] .Th e r ei sa na s t o u n d i n gl a c ko fi nv i t r oa n di nv i v od a t a comparing immune function and cancerogenesis at various temperatures. Recent experiments have shown that housingmiceatthermoneutraltemperature(30-31 C)insteadofstan- dard laboratory temperature (20-26C) reduces tumor for- mation, growth rate, and metastasis. Furthermore, given thechoice, tumor-bearing mice select a higher ambient temper-aturethannon-tumor-bearingmice[92]. (11)Some febrile illnesses may contribute to curing cancer [19,20,25]. Anthroposophicphysiciansmayattimesactuallyattempt to support and elicit fever, particularly in cancer treatment.Metabolic processes and biochemical reaction rates acrossnumerous cellular functions of immune cells are increasedat temperatures that simulate naturally occurring fever, forexample,leucocyteproliferation,maturation,andactivation,neutrophil and monocyte motility, migration, phagocytosisand pinocytosis, T cell expansions, and cytotoxicactivity, antibody production, dendritic cell antigen pro-cessing [93] and presentation to T cells and migration tothe draining lymph nodes, and lysis of bacteria and thebactericidal effect of antibiotics [94-96]. Some tumor cellsmaybemorevulnerabletohighertemperaturesthanhealthycells, a possibility which hyperthermia therapy of cancerattemptsto address. Thisleads to thequestionas to whethertheheataloneisresponsibleforthereportedpossiblecancerregressionsorwhetheractivelygeneratedfeverisessential.

This suggests that more than just increasedheat is needed to fight cancer [102, 106, 107]: immunologicevents that accompany some forms of fever may play a rolein overcoming immunological escape mechanisms of tumordevelopment.

The of mistletoe ( Viscum album L.) for cancer treat- ment was first suggested by Steiner, who emphasized thatfever induction was essential for the success [11, 108]. Aftera pioneering phase with substantial (but all reversible) acutephasereactionsideeffects,mistletoewasmainlyusedinmoreeasily tolerable doses during the past decades [109, 110]. A localinflammatoryreactionattheinjectionsite,feverandflu-likesyndromebelongtotheexpected\"adverseevents\"(thereare several hundred publications on this [111]). The reportedcases of remission, regression, and stable disease in patientstreated solely with mistletoe extracts, however, suggest that high doses and more targeted use may be more likely to achieve an effect and that a strong febrile reaction to themistletoeextractmaybeaprognosticallypositivefactor[109,112-114]andperhapspartoftheanticancereffectofmistletoe[24, 112, 113, 115]. It must be noted, however, that nonfer-mentedViscum album extract usually only induces fever in the first weeks [24]. Chronothermometric examinations suggest that the fever generated by mistletoe injection may enhanceendogenicrhythms,therebyincreasingandharmo- nizingheart-ratevariability[116].Interestingly,tumor-related fever in cases of lymphomas can apparently be overcome bymistletoe-inducedfever[117].Thesechronothermobiological a s pectso fca n certh era ybeco esea r c hin thefuture.

Althoughmanymainstreamhospitalsandpracticeshave not yet translated this into practice [124], there is broad scientific consensus that the potential benefits of the febrile reaction are to be weighed up against the discomfort orexhaustionexperiencedbyaminority[125]. Beyond suppressing the benefits of fever, pharmacologi- calantipyresishasitsownrisks:areviewfinancedbyibupro-fen distributors [126] could not convincingly disprove thatibuprofenmayincreasetheriskofnecrotisingfasciitiscausedby Group Streptococcus (GAS) secondary to varicella or herpes zoster [127-130] while mice inoculated with GAS had increased wound area and mortality when receiving ibuprofen [131].

The suppression of the acute phase reaction symptoms and the slightly euphorizing effect of antipyretics is likelyto increase interaction with other people and the rate andduration of viral shedding, as has been shown in humanvolunteers[144]andferrets[145].Indeed,recentmodelingofavailabledatasuggestsasignificantincreaseincontagionandmortalityriskthroughantipyretics[146].Consideringfurtherthataccidentalacetaminophenoverdosehascausedover100deaths per year in the USA [140], one wonders how manylives may have been saved had anthroposophic physicianspopularized their positive attitude towards fever even more([22] has been a bestseller for several years in German-speakingcountriesbuthasonlyrecentlybeentranslatedintoEnglish).

Another reason often cited for treatingfever is the fear of febrile seizures. However, febrile seizurestendtooccurwithrapidlyrisingtemperaturesinsusceptibleindividuals and not necessarily at high temperatures [148]andarenotpreventablewithantipyretics[149,150].Thereare no studies on the often-observed phenomenon that febrile seizures occur when the child is beginning to shiver andmay thus be avoidable through rapid heat application assoon as one notices that the child may be developing fever.Febrile seizures are a terrible experience for the parents, butso-called \"simple febrile seizures\" are [150, 151]. Febrile seizuresmust be clearly differentiated from epileptic seizures. Therelationship between the latter and fever is highly variable:some are induced by fever, others are suppressed, and manyareindifferent. Anthroposophic physicians rarely resort to antipyretics b u ta r ea wa r e ,fir tl y ,tha tf ev erca nbethesigntha suchas meningitis or pyelonephritis. Second, just as the normaland necessary blood pressure reaction to exertion can bedangerous for some, so can fever, and there are situations inthat it may be maladaptive and deleterious as reflected bynaturally occurring cold-seeking behavior in such cases. Abrainthathasjustbeendamagedbyhypoxiamaybenefitfromhypothermia [152]. In some extreme circumstances, such assevere sepsis in a cool environment, the cost of developingfevermayexceeditsbenefits[34,153,154].Inpatientswithoutcerebral or cardiovascular problems, however, suppressing fever with antipyretics has been associated with a sevenfold increase in mortality in the Miami intensive care unit; afterthis study the colleagues there have become much morerestrictiveintheiruseofantipyresis([52]andpersonalcom-municationtotheauthor).Anthroposophicphysiciansstrivetoprovidepatients,parents,andcaregiverswithinformation that enables them to develop views and inclinations withregard to fever that reduce \"fever phobia\" [155, 156] and arein harmony with the scientific facts, to offer a sense of trustandconfidenceinthefebrileprocessandknowledgeofwhenprofessionalexaminationisneeded[19-21,26,27]. 5. Implications for Clinical Practice Anthroposophic medicinal products are prescribed by approximately 30,000 physicians in 18 of the 27 EU member states and in 67 other countries throughout the world [157]. Caregivers should be aware of the attitudes held in anthro-posophiccirclesandbeorientatedastowhichattitudesstandon solid scientific grounds, which attitudes may be wrong,andwhichattitudesstillrequirevalidationorrefutation. 6. Summary of an (Experienced Participant Observer )on How Fever Is Dealt with in AM-Settings Patientsbeginningfeverduetoanacuteinfectionusuallyfeel cold and shiver despite rising temperature. In this case theyneed to be warmed until they feel warm all the way into theextremities.Thisreduces(1)theworkofincreasingbodytem-perature,(2)theuncomfortablechills,and(3)maybeeventherisk of febrile seizures; there are no studies on this to date.Note that this does not apply to exceptional situations suchas brain injury, in which case cooling may be advantageous.Inanthroposophichouseholds,finewoolorcottonnightwearandcottonsheetsareusedtomaximize\"breathing\"capacity;cheapsyntheticfibersoftenleadtoheatcongestion.Plentyofwarm teas (e.g., elderflower, lime, or lemon) and, if hungry,easily digestible food (soups and fine porridges for theyoungerchildren)arerecommendedinthisphase. Oncetheplateauoffeverhasbeenreached,heatcanbegentlyreleasedso as to prevent sweating, yet avoiding chills. The caregiversshould be able to judge the warmth, breathing, color, andcirculationofthepatient.Coldfeetneedattention.Attentionmust also be paid to the excretory capacity of the body in terms of urine, stools, and sweat. An atmosphere of peace and quiet, free of electronic media and social stress, is seenasconductivetoagoodandsalutogeniccourseoftheillness.Caregiverswhointerpretfebrileillnessesasopportunitiesforbonding,forcuddlytimes,andforstoriesreadortold,gentlemassages, songs sung, beautiful candle-light surroundings,and warm bonding can engender a lasting feeling of trust,thankfulness, and fond memories in their patients, be theyyoung or old. Various forms of internal and external appli-cations can be learned by parents and carers to help patients throughthecourseofaninfection.Themostcommonappli- cations are compresses using lemon (on feet and/or calves), ginger (on kidney/chest area), mustard (on chest), or quark(on chest), depending on the need and constitution of the patient. Enema can relieve discomfort, constipation, and dehydration (enemas must be seen critically and are only acceptableinappropriatesafesettings,yetfamilieswhohave learnt to deal with enemas hardly ever have to bring their8 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine small children into hospital for IV rehydration, making enemas very relevant for third-world and remote areas) [158]. Anthroposophic physicians will additionally recom- mend various herbal remedies depending on the symptoms, stage, and etiology of the illness [19-21, 26, 27, 159]. Two prospective outcomes studies on 12081 [9] and 1016 [7] patients with acute respiratory and ear infections suggestthatanthroposophicphysicianshavethelowestdocumented antibiotic prescription rate at 6.7% [9] and 5.5% (with faster recovery,bettersatisfaction,andhalfasmanysideeffects[7]) versus a moderate rate of 33.6% antibiotic prescription by conventionalphysiciansinthesameGermanstudy[7]. 7. Conclusion Scoping the available literature and views within the anthro-posophic medical community led to thirteen opinion state- ments about fever. Many of these views are now well sub- stantiated scientifically and slowly finding their way into the practice of mainstream medicine [124]: Fever is a self- regulated phenomenon and does not, in a normal healthypatient with an acute infection, cause harm of itself. Going through a feverish illness may contribute to individual devel- opment and long-term health and should be accompanied in a way that fosters salutogenic competencies. Since it is self- regulated,thereisnotemperatureabovewhichthenaturalfever o fa c u t ei n f e ct i o n sm us tb el o w e r e d per se innormalchildren [125]. Antipyretics should be reserved for the cases in which the feveris endangeringthe patient,suchas in severe sepsis or braininjury,wherecoolingisadvantageous,orcausingdistress and malaise and alternative ways of easing their suffering fail or seem inadequate. Beware of the underlying causes of fever and carefully accompany fever instead of suppressing it .Other viewswithregardtothelong-termbenefitsoffeverstillawaitempirical confirmation, negation, or differentiation through furtherresearch. It is important for anthroposophically inclined practi- tioners, carers, and patients to be aware of the fact that the scientific investigation of the effects of febrile infections on short- and long-term health and development in humans is only beginning and that many salutogenic effects [7, 8, 50, 51, 57, 59-63, ventilated sepsis patients [39, 40], brain injury [152], and patients with Brugada syndrome (it may be recommendable to perform an ECG during fever if there is a positive family historyofsuddendeathorsyncope[37,38],bearinginmind that 2% of the population may have asymptomatic Brugada- ECGsignsinfebrileconditions).
