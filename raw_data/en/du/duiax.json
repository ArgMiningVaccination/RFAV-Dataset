At GWCIM, she is offering sessions in Reiki as well as Yoga Therapy. Her individual sessions help patients integrate physical, creative and spiritual aspects into their own unique healing journeys. Yael is no stranger to GWCIM. After completing a year-long Reiki Master's program with Luann Jacobs at GWCIM, she participated in an innovative six-month Clinical Fellowship at the Center in 2010. As part of the fellowship, Yael taught Reiki to GW medical students and GWU Hospital residents during their clinical rotations at GWCIM, provided introductory Reiki treatment sessions at the MFA Breast Care Center Clinic and at the GW Hospital, and participated in the GWUH Palliative Care Team as well as the interdisciplinary CIM team. Yael often integrates Polarity Therapy into her Reiki sessions. Rooted in yoga's sister science of Ayurveda, Polarity Therapy is a comprehensive health system involving energy-based bodywork, diet, exercise and self-awareness. Scientifically, it applies therapeutic methods to human electromagnetic patterns, based on the underlying intention to support a client's inherent self-healing intelligence. Since 2005, Yael has taught yoga classes at area hospitals, libraries, workplaces, schools, and yoga studios. As an integrative yoga therapist (E-RYT500) she facilitates both group and individual yoga therapy sessions, working with people dealing with a variety of conditions including cancer, digestive disorders, diabetes, eating disorders, fibromyalgia, hypertension, mental health challenges (including depression, anxiety, grief and trauma), rheumatoid arthritis, scoliosis, and sports injuries. She currently teaches a weekly therapeutic class for people living with cancer and their caregivers on GW's campus.
