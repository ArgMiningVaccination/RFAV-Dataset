It describes the wide variety of medical and complementary treatments available for controlling your pain. About 3 in 10 (30%) people will have some pain when they are first diagnosed with cancer, and about 7 in 10 (70%) people have pain if their cancer is advanced (has come back or spread). If you have pain, it's important to always tell the doctors and nurses looking after you so they can treat it. As pain is different for each of us, it needs to be treated on an individual basis. Even people with the same type of cancer have very different experiences. The amount of pain you have is not related to how severe your cancer is. Having pain doesn't necessarily mean that the cancer is advanced or more serious. Pain doesn't automatically get worse as the cancer develops. We hope that this booklet answers some of the questions you may have about cancer pain and its treatment, and helps you deal with some of the feelings you may have. You may find that not all of the sections in this booklet are relevant for you. It's fine to just read the sections that you find most helpful. We can't advise you about the best treatment for you. This information can only come from your doctor, who knows your full medical history.3Controlling cancer pain 4Controlling cancer pain If you'd like to discuss this information, call the Macmillan Support Line free on 0808 808 00 00, Monday-Friday, 9am-8pm.

Pain is an uncomfortable, unpleasant physical sensation as well as an emotional experience that occurs when tissues in the body are damaged. The nervous system is made up of your brain, spinal cord and a network of nerves that run throughout your body. The brain is the control centre for your body. There are several steps involved in feeling and reacting to pain: Certain nerves throughout the body have endings known as pain receptors . These can be activated by pressure from a tumour or by chemicals released from damaged tissue. The pain receptors then send messages along the nerves first to your spinal cord and then to your brain. When painful messages reach your brain, you feel pain. The brain responds to pain by sending other messages back along the nerves to direct your reaction. For example, if you feel pain when you move your arm, you may react by keeping it still. The brain can change the way you feel pain. For example, parts of the brain that control our emotions can increase or decrease the sensation of pain. So if you're anxious you may feel more pain, and if you're relaxed you may feel less pain. Sometimes the nerves carrying messages to and from the brain become 'sensitised' or 'wound up'. This means that you continue to feel pain even when what was causing the pain has been treated.6Controlling cancer pain Causes of pain Physical causes People with cancer may have pain for a number of reasons. For example, the cancer may press on the tissues around it or on a nerve. Cancer treatments can also damage or injure tissues. Surgery causes pain, as tissues are cut or damaged. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments can also damage tissues. For example, chemotherapy can damage the soft tissues in the mouth, causing soreness. Radiotherapy treatment can damage the skin in the area being treated. The pain usually goes away once the treatments are completed and the damaged tissues have healed. Sometimes radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments can damage nerves and lead to a type of pain known as neuropathic pain (see page 8). Pain isn't always due to cancer. A person may have other health conditions, such as arthritis, that cause pain. If you develop a new ache or pain, you may understandably worry that this is a sign that the cancer has come back, is getting worse or has spread, but this is not necessarily the case. It's always best to get any new pain checked out by your doctor so you can get the right treatment.7Controlling cancer pain Emotions and pain Emotions such as fear, anxiety, depression and tiredness can make your pain feel and seem worse. This doesn't mean that cancer pain is 'all in the mind'. Symptoms of many physical illnesses, including asthma, heart disease and stomach ulcers, can be made worse by emotional upset. In all of these conditions, as with pain from cancer, it's important to treat the emotional as well as the physical causes of the problem. Social effects on pain Sometimes pain can be made worse by social- or work-related pressures that cause you stress. For example, not being able to see friends or not being able to work can influence pain levels.8Controlling cancer pain Pain terms There are a number of different terms that you might hear your doctors or nurses use to describe pain: Acute pain Acute pain is short term. It's often caused by cancer treatments such as surgery. Chronic pain Chronic pain persists over a longer period of time. With cancer, it's usually caused by the cancer itself, but it can sometimes be caused by cancer treatments. Neuropathic (nerve) pain This is a term that describes pain caused by nerve damage. This may be due to tumour growth or cancer treatments. It can also be caused by nerves becoming 'sensitised' or 'wound up' (see page 5). Neuropathic pain is a type of pain that comes and goes; you may describe it using words such as burning, stabbing, shooting, tingling, radiating or spreading. There are specific medicines that can help treat neuropathic pain (see page 36). Breakthrough pain This is pain that occurs when pain is generally being well controlled with painkillers. It may be brought on quite suddenly by an activity, such as walking or coughing, or it may happen when the effect of the regular painkiller wears off.9Controlling cancer pain Total pain Total pain is a term doctors and nurses use to describe all the different parts of a person's pain. This includes how the pain affects and can be affected by our emotions, our behaviours, our spiritual beliefs and our social activities. Whether you have acute, chronic, neuropathic and/or breakthrough pain, these pains can almost always be controlled with the right treatments.10Controlling cancer pain Describing pain Describing your pain as fully as you can will help your doctors and nurses work out the best way of treating it. Here are some questions that will help you to describe your pain: Where is the pain? Is it in one part of your body or in more than one place? You can use diagrams like the one on the right to mark where your pain is. If you have more than one pain you may want to label them (eg A, B, C). We have included the same diagrams on the back page of the pain diary (see the centre of this booklet). What is the pain like? For example, you may use words such as aching, tender, sharp, hot, burning, nagging, intense, stabbing, tingling, dull or throbbing to describe your pain. For more examples of words you can use to describe your pain, look on the back page of the pain diary that is located at the centre of this booklet.front back 11Controlling cancer pain How bad is your pain? If you measured it on a scale of 0 to 10, how would you rate it (where 0=no pain and 10=the worst pain you've ever had)? Is the pain there all the time? Does it come and go? Does it go if you sit still or get worse when you move? Is it worse at night? Does it keep you awake or wake you up? Does anything make the pain better or worse? Do you feel better or worse standing, sitting or lying down? Does a heat pad or ice pack help? Is it relieved by painkillers such as paracetamol? Do the painkillers stop the pain or just reduce it, and for how long? Can you distract yourself with activities such as reading, listening to music or watching TV? How does the pain affect your daily life? Does it stop you from bending or stretching as usual? Does it stop you from sitting for very long - for example, can you sit long enough to eat a meal? Does the pain stop you from concentrating or affect your sleep? Does it stop you from walking for short or long distances? Don't feel that you're being a nuisance or making a fuss by talking about your pain. Your answers to these questions will help your doctor or nurse plan the best treatments for you. 10 5 012Controlling cancer pain 13Controlling cancer pain Keeping a pain diary It can help to keep a record of your pain. List how bad it is at different times of the day and note anything that makes it better or worse. This information can help you discuss your pain with the doctors or nurses looking after you. Some hospitals will give you a pain chart. You can also use the pull-out pain diary in the centre of this booklet. You might want to photocopy it before you fill it in; then you can use it as often as you need to. You may find it helpful to photocopy the back page of the diary as well, as it contains a diagram to mark where the pain is and a list of words that may help you describe your pain. Managing pain How your pain is managed will depend on a number of factors, such as the cause of the pain and how bad it is for you. Painkillers are often used, but you may also have treatments such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy (see page 38). Other ways to control your pain include TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), nerve blocks, acupuncture and relaxation therapies (see page 41). Your pain management team A number of healthcare professionals may be involved in managing your pain. These healthcare professionals specialise in different aspects of pain management and work closely together. They include your GP and your cancer doctors at the hospital. The following teams or people may also be involved:14Controlling cancer pain Pain teams Many hospitals have pain teams that have specialist doctors - usually anaesthetists - and nurses who advise on all aspects of pain control. Some teams also have a psychologist. The doctors and nurses who work in pain teams are skilled in using all the methods of pain control discussed in this booklet, but they specialise in the use of nerve blocks (see page 43). Your GP may refer you to a pain team or you may be referred by your palliative care team, particularly if your pain is troublesome and you need a nerve block. Physiotherapists and occupational therapists A physiotherapist may be able to show you different ways of moving yourself so that your pain isn't made worse by movement (see page 44). They can also arrange for you to have a wheelchair if that will help you move around more easily. An occupational therapist may be able to supply you with equipment, such as special cushions or mattresses, to make you more comfortable when you are sitting up or lying down. They can also assess whether you need aids for daily living, such as handrails and ramps for your home so that you can get around more easily. Your GP, nurse or hospital doctor can refer you to a physiotherapist or occupational therapist. Counsellors and psychologists Some people may find it helpful to see a counsellor or psychologist about their pain. They can help you develop skills to cope with the pain and manage any worries or concerns that may be making your pain worse (see page 47).15Controlling cancer pain Palliative care teams Palliative care teams can be based in a hospital or the community. They include doctors and palliative care nurses and may also include physiotherapists, occupational therapists and counsellors. Hospital teams only work in the hospital. They can help you with your pain control if you're attending an outpatient clinic or if you're an inpatient. Community teams tend to work from a local hospice and have doctors and nurses who can visit you in your own home. They give advice and guidance on pain and other symptoms, and can provide emotional support for you and your family. Your GP will know which community palliative care and hospice services are available in your area. Sometimes it can help to spend a few days or weeks in a hospice having your pain, symptoms and other problems treated. Your community palliative care team or GP can arrange this for you. In the hospice, the doctors and nurses can often adjust the dose of or add in new painkillers more quickly than if you were at home. Once your pain is controlled, you can go home again to the care of your GP with the support of your community palliative care team. Marie Curie nursing service Marie Curie nurses help care for people who are having treatment to control their symptoms, such as pain, and want to stay in their own homes. They will stay for a period of time during the day and/or the night. Your district nurse or palliative care nurse will be able to give you more information about the Marie Curie nursing service in your area.16Controlling cancer pain It's important that you, your family, your GP and the specialist services know who is supervising your pain control and who you should contact if you have pain or other symptoms. You should be able to get help and advice, by telephone or in person during the day or night. Painkillers There are many painkillers available to treat different types and levels of pain, whether it's mild, moderate or severe. Painkilling drugs are known as analgesics . Your medical team will aim to find the right combination of painkillers and other therapies to ensure that your pain is managed in the best possible way. Some people with cancer have constant pain, so they need to take painkillers regularly to keep the pain under control. It's important not to let pain build up until it's severe. Severe pain can cause fear, anxiety and difficulty sleeping, which can make the pain worse and more difficult to control. Painkillers taken by mouth (oral medicines) Painkilling drugs are usually taken by mouth - either as tablets or capsules. For people who find it hard to swallow, many oral medicines are available as liquids and some can be dissolved in water. Other ways to take painkillers There are several other ways of taking painkillers that can be helpful if you can't swallow or are being sick: Feeding tube - If you have a feeding tube, such as a PEG or RIG tube, some liquid or soluble painkillers can be given through the tube.17Controlling cancer pain Skin patches - These are stuck on to the skin. These are useful when your pain control is more settled. They only need to be changed every few days. Buccal and sublingual medicines - These are absorbed from the tissues in the mouth, so they don't have to be swallowed. They are usually used for controlling breakthrough pain, as they work quickly. Nasal medicines - Some painkillers can be sprayed into the nose. These work best for breakthrough pain. Suppositories - These are inserted into the back passage. Injection - Many painkillers can be given by injection, either into a muscle or more usually under the skin (subcutaneously). Infusion - Some painkillers can be given by infusion over a period of time: Subcutaneous infusion A subcutaneous infusion involves giving a continuous dose of a drug or drugs into a fine needle or cannula (fine, plastic tube) that is placed just under the skin. A small portable pump known as a syringe driver (see page 30) is used to give the drugs this way. Intravenous infusion using a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump After surgery, you may have a PCA pump to control your pain. A cannula is placed in a vein in your arm or the back of your hand and a thin tube is used to connect the cannula to the PCA pump. The pump has a handset that you press to give yourself a set dose of a painkiller, usually morphine. You can press the handset as often as needed to ensure your pain is controlled. 18Controlling cancer pain Epidural analgesia Occasionally painkillers may be given by infusion into the space that lies just outside the membranes surrounding the spinal cord. This is known as epidural analgesia. Sometimes the painkiller is given into the fluid around the spinal cord - this is known as intrathecal analgesia (see page 43). These specialised techniques are usually only used to control severe pain and are managed by anaesthetists, who specialise in pain control. If you need to have your painkillers by injection or infusion, your doctor or nurse will discuss this with you. Storing painkillers It's very important to store painkillers carefully. Make sure that they are properly labelled, and lock them up or keep them out of reach of children. If you're worried about forgetting to take them, write a note to yourself and put it somewhere you will see it rather than leaving the medicines out. Alternatively, you could ask your partner, relative or friend to remind you to take them, or you could create an alarm on your computer or mobile phone and title it 'Painkillers'. It may help you keep track of when your drugs are taken by writing them in your pain diary (see the centre of this booklet). Always return any unused medicines to a pharmacist, who can dispose of them properly.19Controlling cancer pain Levels of pain control There are different types of painkillers that are effective for mild, moderate or severe pain. These are set out in an 'analgesic ladder' (see below). Mild pain oxycodone, fentanyl or diamorphine The idea behind the analgesic ladder is that if a person's pain is not controlled by the painkillers on one level, their doctor should prescribe a drug from the next level rather than try a different painkiller from the same group. For example, if you're taking a mild painkiller such as paracetamol but are still getting pain, or if your pain gets worse, your doctor should prescribe a weak opioid (moderate) painkiller such as dihydrocodeine, codeine phosphate or tramadol. If the pain still isn't controlled or if it increases, your doctor could then prescribe a strong opioid painkiller. You don't have to start with painkillers from the mild group - if you have moderate or severe pain when you first see your doctor, you can start by taking painkillers from the second or third step of the ladder. 20Controlling cancer pain Often, painkillers from two different groups will be used at the same time, as they work in different ways. For example, a strong painkiller such as morphine can be used at the same time as a mild painkiller such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. At each step of the analgesic ladder, other drugs can also be used to help to control pain. These include bisphosphonates, steroids and anti-neuropathic drugs (see page 35). Although they are not painkillers, they can be used for specific types of pain. Mild drugs for pain relief Mild pain is treated with painkillers, such as paracetamol, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Paracetamol can be used for a variety of mild pains. It can be bought over the counter from a chemist, and many supermarkets sell paracetamol. It has few side effects, but it's important not to exceed the recommended dose, as higher doses can damage the liver. Paracetamol does not reduce inflammation. Anti-inflammatory drugs help reduce inflammation and swelling, and are especially good at treating pain in the skin, muscle or bone. Ibuprofen can be bought from a pharmacist or from many supermarkets. Diclofenac sodium (Voltarol \u00ae) and celecoxib (Celebrex\u00ae) need to be prescribed by a doctor. Check with your doctor or nurse before taking anti-inflammatory medicines, as they may interact with other medicines you are taking or may not be suitable for you. Always check the recommended dose on the packet and never take a higher dose than recommended. 21Controlling cancer pain Remember that other medicines or tablets that you can buy over the counter from a pharmacy or supermarket (eg cold cures) may also contain paracetamol or anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen. These should not be taken in addition to other pain medicines unless advised by your doctor. Check with your pharmacist first before buying any other medicines. Anti-inflammatory drugs can cause indigestion and may irritate the lining of the stomach, so it's important to take them after a meal or snack. Your doctor may prescribe an additional tablet to help protect your stomach. If you've had previous problems with stomach ulcers, your doctor may advise you not to take them at all. Weak opioid drugs for pain relief Moderate pain is treated with weak opioid drugs such as dihydrocodeine (DF118 Forte \u00ae, DHC Continus\u00ae), phosphate or tramadol. These are often combined with paracetamol in a single tablet (eg co-codamol, which contains codeine and paracetamol, or co-dydramol, which contains dihydrocodeine and paracetamol). such as Tylex\u00ae, Remedeine\u00ae, Solpadol\u00ae, Kapake\u00ae and Tramacet\u00ae. Most are only available on prescription from a doctor. There is a limit to the number of tablets that can be taken in one day because of the paracetamol content. If your pain isn't controlled, it's important to let your doctor know so that you can be switched to stronger painkillers.22Controlling cancer pain Side effects of weak opioid drugs Constipation Painkillers containing dihydrocodeine and codeine can cause constipation. Usually you'll need to take a laxative, which your doctor should prescribe for you (see page 25). Tramadol is less likely to cause constipation than codeine and dihydrocodeine. Drowsiness This type of painkiller may also cause drowsiness, which may be increased by alcohol (see page 24). Dry mouth Some drugs may make your mouth dry. Sickness Some people feel sick (nausea) and some may actually be sick (vomiting). If you feel sick, let your doctor know. Your doctor may prescribe anti-sickness medicines or suggest that you try an alternative painkiller. Strong opioid drugs for pain relief Severe pain is treated with strong opioid drugs. Commonly used strong opioids are: 23Controlling cancer pain 24Controlling cancer pain With this type of painkiller, it's important for your doctor to find the most effective dose for you. Two people with the same type of cancer may need different doses of a drug, even if they're at the same stage of their illness. It's common to start at a low dose and build up gradually to a dose that controls your pain. Other painkillers, such as paracetamol or anti-inflammatory drugs, can also be used with a strong opioid painkiller to help keep pain controlled. If your pain increases or decreases, the dose of your opioid painkiller can be adjusted. You may only need a small dose increase to get your pain under control again. But if your pain is bad, your doctors may increase the dose by a larger amount - this is more likely to get on top of your pain than a smaller dose increase. Side effects of strong opioid painkillers It can take a few days to adjust to taking strong opioid painkillers. The most common side effects are: Drowsiness This usually passes within a few days once you're used to the dose. Alcohol may increase drowsiness so if you do drink alcohol, it's best to reduce your intake when you start taking strong painkillers. You can then gradually increase it if drowsiness isn't a problem. Feeling tired Painkillers may also make you feel tired. You can talk to your GP about how this may affect you at home and at work. If you're planning to drive or work with machinery, you should check with your GP before taking strong opioid painkillers. Don't drive if you don't feel fully alert or if your reactions are slowed.25Controlling cancer pain Constipation All strong opioid painkillers cause constipation. If you're taking strong painkillers, you should also take a laxative throughout your treatment. Some laxatives soften stools and make them easier to pass while others stimulate the bowel to push the stools along more quickly. A combination of these two types is often best at preventing constipation. Sickness You may feel sick when you first start taking strong opioid painkillers, so you may need to take an anti-sickness (anti-emetic) drug for at least the first week of treatment. If you have sickness that doesn't settle after 7 days, let your doctor know. Changing to another strong painkiller may help stop the sickness. Dry mouth These drugs can make your mouth dry, which can be a nuisance. This symptom can be relieved by drinking plenty of liquids. Chewing gum can also help. Other effects If the dose of a strong opioid painkiller is too high, it can cause symptoms such as marked drowsiness, confusion, hallucinations (seeing things that are not real), slow and deep breathing, and low blood pressure, which may make you feel dizzy or faint. Let your doctor know straightaway if you experience any of these effects. Remember that although all strong opioid painkillers cause similar side effects, some may suit you better than others. If your pain is not well controlled, or if the side effects are a problem, tell your doctor or nurse so that your dose can be adjusted or another type of strong painkiller can be tried.26Controlling cancer pain Specific types of strong painkillers such as morphine, fentanyl, commonly used, but hydromorphone, methadone and alfentanil are less commonly used. The text below describes the drugs, how they can be given and some possible side effects. Morphine Morphine can be taken in various ways: short-acting (MST Continus\u00ae) suppositories, which are usually short acting, inserted into the back passage (morphine) a short-acting injection (morphine sulphate). A short-acting type of morphine is usually taken every four hours to begin with so that the dose can be adjusted until the pain is well controlled. It's usually taken as a tablet or a liquid. Liquid morphine has a bitter taste that can be improved by mixing it with a fruit drink. Once the right dose has been worked out, you will be able to take long-acting tablets, capsules or granules to mix with water. These release the morphine dose very slowly over a period of either 12 or 24 hours, depending on which type you are taking. 27Controlling cancer pain If you're not able to swallow or are vomiting, morphine (as well as diamorphine and oxycodone) can be given by injection or as an infusion using a syringe driver (see page 30). Occasionally morphine suppositories are used. Side effects Morphine has the usual side effects of strong painkillers mentioned on page 24. Some people find that the side effects of morphine can't be controlled. They may have ongoing drowsiness or sickness that isn't relieved by the usual medicines. In this case, it's likely that your doctor will switch you to another strong opioid painkiller such as oxycodone or fentanyl. Side effects of painkillers vary from person to person and from one drug to another, so it's usually possible to find another drug that suits you better. Fentanyl Fentanyl is usually given as a skin patch or as a buccal medicine (see page 17). The patches (Durogesic DTrans \u00ae) look like waterproof plasters. They are stuck on to the skin, and the drug is released slowly through the skin. The patch is usually changed every three days, and the new patch is put on a different area of skin. The patches can be convenient, as you don't need to remember to take tablets regularly. When the patch is first used, it takes around 12-24 hours for the fentanyl to reach its maximum level in the blood. During this time you'll usually need to take a short-acting strong opioid such as morphine to keep the pain controlled. There are two buccal preparations: a short-acting (Effentora\u00ae). The lozenge and tablet are placed in the mouth between the cheek and the gum. They are absorbed from the soft tissues lining the cheek area 28Controlling cancer pain and act quickly to reduce pain. They work best for breakthrough pain (see page 8). Fentanyl can also be given as a nasal spray or as a tablet that is placed under the tongue (sublingual). Side effects The side effects are the same as for all strong painkillers, although the patches may also cause a slight skin rash where they are applied. For some people, fentanyl causes less constipation than other types of opioid drugs. When using the skin patch, warmth can make the fentanyl absorb more quickly through the skin. So if you have a high temperature, it's important to let your doctor or nurse know immediately. It's also important to avoid heating the skin patch, so care should be taken when going out in the sun, bathing, showering or using a heat pad near the patch. For the following drugs, the general side effects for strong opioid painkillers (see page 24) apply. Oxycodone Oxycodone is given as short-acting capsules or liquid (OxyNorm \u00ae), which are taken every 4-6 hours, or long-acting tablets (OxyContin\u00ae), which are taken every 12 hours. It may be used if morphine causes too many side effects or doesn't control the pain well enough. Oxycodone can also be given by injection or continuously in a syringe driver (see page 30).29Controlling cancer pain Buprenorphine Buprenorphine may be given as: a patch (Transtec\u00ae) that is changed every 3-4 days a patch (BuTrans\u00ae) that is changed every seven days a tablet (Temgesic\u00ae) that is dissolved under the tongue every 6-8 hours. Diamorphine Diamorphine may be used for people who can't swallow and who need to have their painkillers given by injection or continuously by a syringe driver (see page 30). Hydromorphone Hydromorphone is available as capsules (Palladone \u00ae) and long-acting capsules (Palladone\u00ae SR). MethadoneMethadone may be given as tablets or syrup or injection. It's usually only given under close supervision from a specialist palliative care doctor or pain doctor. Methadone may be helpful for neuropathic pain (see page 8). Alfentanil Alfentanil is another strong painkiller that is only given by injection or subcutaneous infusion (see page 17). It's more likely to be used if someone's kidney function is poor. We can send you fact sheets on managing side effects, including how to cope with a dry mouth. 30Controlling cancer pain Syringe drivers A number of strong painkillers can be given by a syringe driver - these include morphine, oxycodone, diamorphine and alfentanil. A syringe driver is a small portable pump that can be used to give you a continuous dose of your painkiller and other medicines. It's often used if you're vomiting or unable to swallow. Your doctor or nurse will let you know if you need a syringe driver. A syringe driver is easy to set up. A syringe containing the painkiller is put into the driver and attached to a fine needle or cannula (fine, plastic tube) that is placed just under the skin (subcutaneously). A small dose of the drug is then released at a constant rate for as long as you need it. The syringe is usually changed every 24 hours by a nurse. This method of giving drugs is known as subcutaneous infusion (see page 17) and is very effective in keeping people free of pain. Syringe drivers are battery powered and portable so you can be up and about as usual. They clip easily onto a belt, fit into a pocket or bum bag, or can be placed in a specially designed holster that fits under your arm. Other medicines, such as anti-sickness medicines, can also be given by the syringe driver. Some people worry that if they have advanced cancer and are given painkillers or other medicines by a syringe driver, this could hasten their death. This isn't true. A syringe driver is simply a different way of giving the same or similar drugs at the doses needed to control your symptoms.31Controlling cancer pain Facts about painkillers for cancer pain There are many myths about painkillers, especially strong ones such as morphine. These can often cause fears and worries and may lead to pain not being controlled. It can help to know some of the facts about painkilling drugs when you start taking them. When should I take my painkillers? You should start taking your painkillers when you have pain. Many people believe that they should put off using painkillers for as long as possible and that they should only get help when pain is becoming unbearable. This can mean that people are in pain unnecessarily and can also make the pain more difficult to control. There is no need to 'save' them until you're very ill or your pain is severe. Do I have to take my painkillers regularly? When you're taking painkillers, always be sure to take them regularly as prescribed by your doctor. The aim is to make sure that the pain control is constant. If you've been given painkillers for breakthrough pain (see page 8), don't wait for it to get really bad before you take them. It's important to let your doctors and nurses know if your pain isn't controlled with your regular painkillers or if you get breakthrough pain. You may need to have your regular dose adjusted, or you may need to have a different painkiller. Remember that it can sometimes take a little time to get the right painkiller and the correct dose to control your pain. 32Controlling cancer pain 33Controlling cancer pain If I'm given a strong painkiller, does that mean that my cancer is advanced?If you have severe pain you may be given a strong painkiller, such as morphine, straightaway. This doesn't mean that the cancer is more serious, just that the pain is severe. The dose can easily be adjusted as necessary if the pain gets better or worse. Being started on a strong painkiller doesn't mean you will always need to take it. If your pain improves, you may be able to take a milder painkiller. Will my painkillers be given in combination with any other medicines? You may be given other medicines such as antidepressants, antiepileptics (drugs that prevent fits or seizures but are also used for neuropathic pain) and muscle relaxants to take with your painkillers. These medicines will also help to control your pain, but will do so in a different way from your painkillers. They are discussed on pages 35-37. Will I become addicted to painkillers? Many people who are prescribed strong opioid painkillers such as morphine ask if they will get addicted to it or if they will become confused and unable to look after themselves. This is unlikely to happen. People who become addicted to drugs usually initially choose to take them and then keep taking them because they have a psychological need. For example, they may crave feeling disconnected or 'high' when they take them. This is very different to someone who is in physical pain and needs to take the drug to control their pain. 34Controlling cancer pain What is the right dose of a strong opioid painkiller? Unlike many other drugs, there is no standard dose for morphine or other strong opioid painkillers. The right dose is the one that controls your pain, and this varies from person to person. Is there a maximum dose you can take? If morphine or other painkillers are taken as prescribed, you will not overdose. There is no maximum dose for strong opioid painkillers. However, suddenly increasing the dose is dangerous, so never increase the dose or take extra doses without talking to your doctor first. Can I just stop taking a strong opioid painkiller? If you're taking morphine or another strong opioid painkiller, it's important that you don't suddenly stop taking it. This is because as well as controlling pain, strong painkillers have other physical effects, and if they're suddenly stopped, you may get withdrawal effects. These include diarrhoea, cramping pains in the stomach and bowel, sickness, sweating, restlessness and agitation. If you want to stop taking a strong opioid painkiller, you should always talk to your doctor first. Your doctor will tell you how to gradually reduce the dose over a period of weeks or months so that you avoid these withdrawal effects.35Controlling cancer pain Other helpful medicines (adjuvant drugs) You may be prescribed other medicines, known as adjuvant drugs, to take along with your regular painkillers. These include: Bisphosphonates People who have pain from cancer that has spread to the bones may find drugs called bisphosphonates helpful. As well as helping to reduce pain, bisphosphonates can also strengthen the affected bones. Bisphosphonates may be given as a drip into a vein, usually once a month, or as tablets. We can send you fact sheets about individual bisphosphonate drugs. SteroidsWhen pain is caused by a tumour pressing on or damaging a nerve, steroid drugs may help relieve this pressure and so reduce pain. They may be given alone or with other painkillers. Commonly used steroids are dexamethasone and prednisolone. Side effectsAlthough they generally make you feel better, they may also increase your appetite. Steroids may make you put on weight, and they can increase your risk of getting infections. The levels of sugar in your blood may also change temporarily. Tell your doctor or nurse if you become very thirsty and start going to the toilet to pass urine more often, as this may be due to an increase in your blood sugar level. 36Controlling cancer pain Some people find that steroids make them feel agitated or irritable because they make the mind more active. Steroids can make it more difficult to sleep, but this is less of a problem if they are taken in the morning. The side effects disappear gradually once treatment is over. Steroids can also cause indigestion and may irritate the lining of the stomach (sometimes causing bleeding), so it's important to take them after a meal or snack. Your doctor may prescribe other tablets in addition to the steroids to help protect your stomach. We have a fact sheet on steroids that explains the side effects in detail. Antiepileptic and antidepressant drugsAntiepileptic drugs such as gabapentin, pregabalin or carbamazepine or low-dose antidepressants such as amitriptyline can help reduce pain caused by nerve damage. This type of pain is called neuropathic pain (see page 8). The dose of these medicines may need to be gradually increased over a few days or weeks to control the pain, so it's important to continue taking them even if they don't work straightaway. Some people worry that if they're started on low doses of antidepressants for nerve pain, it's because their doctor thinks they're depressed, but this isn't the case; research has shown that low doses of antidepressants are effective for nerve pain, but higher doses are needed to treat depression. Some people find that the antidepressant amitriptyline can make them feel sleepier or slightly 'hungover'. If this happens to you, let your doctor or nurse know. You should also make sure you take the dose at night to prevent you from feeling drowsy during the day.37Controlling cancer pain Antibiotics When pain is due to an underlying infection, your doctor will likely prescribe you antibiotics to treat the infection. Muscle relaxants If muscle spasms are making your pain worse, you may have a short course of a drug, such as diazepam (Valium\u00ae), baclofen (Lioresal\u00ae) or clonazepam (Rivotril\u00ae), to help relax the muscles. Daily drug schedule If you are taking several different drugs, you may find it helpful to draw up a chart that lists: the drugs you're taking what they're for their doses the time of day to take them. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist can help you do this, or they may be able to give you a chart to fill in this information. Make sure it has space for you to tick off each dose as you take it. Pill organisers You may find it easier to have your drugs arranged in a container (called a 'pill organiser' or 'dosette box') labelled with the times you need to take them. Then you can always check that you're up to date. The aim is to make things as simple as possible. If you find it difficult to remember to take medicines several times a day, talk this over with your doctor. There may be other types of the same drug that can be taken less often.38Controlling cancer pain You may find it useful to keep a diary of how well your pain and other symptoms are being controlled, as well as the painkillers you're taking (see the centre of this booklet). This will help your medical team too. They will be able to see whether the doses of any of your painkillers need changing. If you don't want to bother writing a full diary, just make a note if your pain comes back before your next dose of painkillers is due, and note when you need to take any extra doses. Using cancer treatments for pain control If pain is being caused by a tumour, treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or hormonal therapy may help to treat the tumour and reduce the pain. We can send you more information on all the treatments mentioned in this section. Surgery can be used to remove part, or all, of a tumour to relieve pressure on organs or a nerve. Sometimes, laser treatment can be used to reduce the size of the tumour. Radiotherapy is sometimes used to shrink a tumour. This can reduce pain and other symptoms. Radiotherapy is an effective way of controlling pain in the bones - especially the spine, thigh bones (femur), pelvis and ribs. It can help relieve pain and allows the bone to build up its strength again. Usually only one or two sessions of radiotherapy are needed. The treatment doesn't work immediately; it usually takes 7-10 days before it has an effect. You will need to keep taking your other painkillers during this time. The dose of radiotherapy 39Controlling cancer pain 40Controlling cancer pain used to treat pain is quite low, and the treatment has very few side effects other than tiredness (fatigue). We have a booklet called Coping with fatigue that you may find useful. Sometimes radioisotopes may be used to help control pain in the bones. Radioisotopes are mildly radioactive substances that are taken up (absorbed) by the bones. The isotope is given as a liquid injected into a vein in the arm. When the isotope reaches the bone affected by cancer, it releases a dose of radiotherapy, which can help relieve pain. Strontium 89 is an example of a radioisotope. It can often take several weeks or even months for this type of treatment to work, so you'll need to carry on with your ordinary painkillers in the meantime. In some people, chemotherapy can shrink tumours to reduce pain and help people feel better, but it may cause side effects that are difficult to deal with. However, for others the treatment doesn't work, and they will have the side effects of the treatment without the benefits. Some chemotherapy drugs cause hair loss, and many of them can reduce your resistance to infection and cause tiredness, a sore mouth or diarrhoea. A few chemotherapy drugs can cause nerve pain. Your doctor can discuss with you whether chemotherapy may be helpful for your pain. Ask your doctor how likely it is to work and what the side effects may be, so that you can decide whether chemotherapy would be helpful in your situation. Hormonal therapy can be used to reduce pain for some types of cancer, such as breast and prostate cancer. Hormonal 41Controlling cancer pain therapies can shrink these cancers by altering the levels of particular hormones in the body or by preventing certain hormones from attaching to cancer cells. There are many different types of hormonal therapy, and the side effects of each vary. However, hormonal therapies do not tend to cause severe side effects. Your doctor can discuss with you whether hormonal therapies may be useful in controlling your pain, how likely the treatment is to work for you and what the possible side effects are. Making decisions about treatment in these circumstances is always difficult. You may like to discuss the benefits and side effects of treatment with your doctor before making a decision about whether or not to have the treatment. You can also discuss these issues with our cancer support specialists on 0800 808 00 00 or you can contact some of the support organisations mentioned on pages 64-81. Other methods of pain control Other methods of pain control can be used on their own or in combination with painkillers. They include: transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) nerve blocks physiotherapy acupuncture relaxation techniques hypnotherapy meditation42Controlling cancer pain visualisation emotional support spiritual help. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) TENS machines send a weak electrical current through the skin. TENS works in two ways: It stimulates the nerves that carry non-painful messages to the brain. As these nerves are stimulated, they override and block the messages being carried in the pain nerves. This prevents painful messages from reaching the brain. It can also make the body release its own natural painkillers called endorphins. TENS can help relieve cancer pain, especially if it's in a specific part of the body. It's common to use TENS alongside other treatments for pain. TENS machines are usually only available for short-term loan on the NHS. Pain teams, physiotherapists and many palliative care teams can advise you on whether TENS is suitable for you and how to use it. Usually they will loan you a TENS machine so you can see how helpful it is before you decide whether to buy one. There are also many companies that sell TENS machines, but it's always best to get specialist advice before buying and using a TENS machine.Pain DiArY How to use your pain diary 1. Begin by noting down the date when you use a new diary. You can fill in the diary as often as you need to. If your pain isn't well controlled, you may want to fill it in every 1-2 hours, but if it 's better controlled, you can fill it in every 4-6 hours. 2. Note where the pain is on your body - you can use the body outlines on the back page of the diary. It could be in one area (ie your arm) or in multiple areas (ie your neck, shoulders and back). 3. Describe what the pain feels like using words such as dull, aching, pricking, sharp, sore, stabbing, comes and goes, constant, hot, cold and unbearable. See the back page of the diary for more words you can use to describe your pain. 4. Rate the level of pain on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means 'no pain' and 10 means 'severe pain' (see the back page of the diary). 5. Note down what medicines or pain control methods you used, as well as anything that made the pain better or worse. All of this information will help you, your doctors and your nurses find the best pain control methods for you. Remember to photocopy the back page of the diary to go along with each pain diary you complete.pain diAr YKeeping a record of your pain will help you discuss it with your doctors and nurses.

If you have more than one pain you may want to label them (ie A, B, C). 0 10 5front back 43Controlling cancer pain Nerve blocks Nerve blocks may help relieve pain by preventing pain messages from getting to the brain (see page 5). Nerves can be blocked using drugs such as local anaesthetics (sometimes given with steroids) or other chemicals such as alcohol or phenol. Local anaesthetics produce a short-lasting block. Although alcohol or phenol produce a longer-lasting block, they are less commonly used because of the side effects associated with them. Specific nerve blocks may help specific pains. For example, pain from the pancreas may be reduced by something called a coeliac plexus block. Occasionally epidural or intrathecal analgesia (see page 18) may be needed to control severe pain that is very difficult to control or if painkillers are causing unacceptable side effects. These techniques usually involve giving a continuous infusion of a painkiller (such as morphine, diamorphine or fentanyl) with or without a local anaesthetic by a fine tube that is inserted into the epidural or intrathecal space. The tube may be connected to an external pump or an internal pump, which is placed under the skin during a minor surgical procedure. The pumps are refilled with painkillers as required. Nerve blocks are specialist techniques that are usually carried out by a pain team specialist (usually an anaesthetist) in your local hospital or at a specialist pain clinic. Your GP or hospital specialist can refer you to a pain team specialist, who usually works as part of a wider team of healthcare professionals known as a pain team (see page 14).44Controlling cancer pain Physiotherapy Pain may stop you from using the part of your body that hurts. This can lead to the deterioration of muscles and joint stiffness, which in turn may make pain and disability worse. Physiotherapy can help treat the problem and lead to an improvement in pain relief. Your GP will be able to refer you to a physiotherapist, who will be able to advise you on exercises that may help. Acupuncture It's thought that acupuncture may work by stimulating the body to produce endorphins. It can be helpful for some people with cancer. A number of specialist NHS pain and palliative care teams offer acupuncture. Your GP or cancer specialist can refer you. Relaxation techniques Learning to relax and let go of your fears and anxieties - even if only for a short time each day - can play a useful part in your overall pain control. There are two main types of relaxation exercises: Physical exercises work on tension in your body. A technique called progressive muscle relaxation involves getting to know particular groups of muscles in the body and learning to tense and relax them. Once you can relax and contract stomach muscles, neck muscles and others individually or together, you can start using the technique during stressful periods to help reduce tension and therefore pain. When you have learned the basic techniques, you can use them to help with pain relief during more difficult times. Mental exercises, such as imagery exercises, help relax your mind. These can be particularly helpful if you find that anxiety is making your pain worse.45Controlling cancer pain 46Controlling cancer pain Try to find a quiet, warm, dimly lit, relaxing place where you will not be disturbed, then lie or sit in a well-supported position. You will get the maximum benefit from these techniques if you practise them for 5-15 minutes each day. Using relaxation tapes can be great way to learn different exercises. You may want to just experiment until you find the best exercise for you, or you can ask your doctor if there is a healthcare professional, such as an occupational therapist or psychologist, who can help you find the technique that's best for you. Hypnotherapy Hypnotherapy may help relieve cancer pain, but it is rarely effective on its own. However, self-hypnosis can play a part in helping you relax, which can help reduce the effect of emotional upset on your level of pain. Your GP may have a list of local therapists who provide hypnotherapy, or you can contact the National Register of Hypnotherapists and Psychotherapists for further information (see page 69). Meditation If you're being treated for any mental illnesses, check with your doctor before using meditation. Although meditation can be helpful - for those with anxiety and depression, for example - it can also make problems worse if not properly supervised. There are many different types of meditation, but they are all aimed at calming your mind and becoming at peace with yourself. You can try meditation by sitting quietly and being aware of your breathing, without trying to control it. Whenever you become aware that thoughts have come up in your mind, just come back to the awareness of your breathing. If you prefer, you can put an object in front of you and pay attention to that instead.47Controlling cancer pain Meditation can be very difficult at first, and you may feel initially that you are getting worse as you become aware of how busy your mind is. However, it will become easier as you practise. It may help you let go of distressing or depressed thoughts for a period of time. It's helpful to practise meditation once or twice a day and to have guidance from an experienced meditator. You can find details of meditation organisations in your local phone book or at your local library. Visualisation Visualisation (creating mental images) is a technique that helps you bring happy, relaxing pictures into your mind and use them to overcome some of your pain. By 'seeing' and 'hearing' images and sounds that bring you pleasure, you can, to some extent, shut out symptoms of pain and discomfort. You may find meditation, visualisation, relaxation or a combination of these techniques helpful in relieving your pain. Methods vary but the overall aim is the same: to reduce stress and other emotional factors that may be making your pain worse. You can either go to classes to learn these techniques or buy tapes, CDs, records or books. Your GP may know of local relaxation classes, some of which are especially suited to the needs of people with cancer. Meditation, relaxation and visualisation are explained more fully in our booklet Cancer and complementary therapies . Emotional support It's natural to feel a whole range of powerful emotions, including depression, fear and anxiety, when dealing with cancer. These emotions can make pain worse. 48Controlling cancer pain It's important that you are given emotional support. It helps if you acknowledge your feelings and don't bottle things up. Our booklet The emotional effects of cancer discusses ways of dealing with emotions. You may have anxious feelings from time to time and it may help to talk through your feelings with your partner, a close friend or relative. If you feel anxious most of the time or you don't feel able to talk to someone close to you (perhaps because it upsets you both too much), let your GP know. Your GP can put you in touch with a counsellor. You could also contact one of the counselling organisations listed on pages 68-69 or you can speak to our cancer support specialists on 0808 808 00 00 , who may be able to give you contact details of local support groups. Sometimes your GP may suggest that you take either an antidepressant or a sedative drug such as diazepam to help improve your mood or reduce anxiety. Spiritual help Serious illness can force people to take life more seriously, to question its meaning and to stop taking things for granted. Some people who have religious beliefs may find their faith greatly shaken by their cancer diagnosis. Even people who have never been regular worshippers may experience spiritual as well as emotional pain. People often ask questions such as, 'Is there life after death?' and 'Why should the people I love suffer?' Unanswered questions such as these, which relate to fundamental beliefs, can cause great emotional and spiritual pain that can increase the experience of physical pain.49Controlling cancer pain It's often hard to accept or understand why an illness like cancer happens to you or to those you love. People often have feelings of anger and guilt, and you may worry about how the cancer will affect your family now and in the future. Sometimes the strength of these emotions may make you feel isolated and frightened, and you may withdraw from family and friends. It can help to talk to someone about these feelings. Some people find great comfort in religion at this time, and it may help to talk to a local minister, hospital chaplain or other religious or spiritual leader. If you don't feel that this is the right sort of support for you, talking with family and friends, a counsellor or someone from a cancer support organisation may help. Details of organisations that provide counselling are on pages 68-69. How other people can help you Many people assume that drugs or other treatments are the only way to control cancer pain. In fact, they are only one part of treatment. Sometimes the simplest ways of making you feel better are overlooked. There are a lot of things, on their own or together with medical treatment, that you and other people can do to make you feel better. Are you comfortable? The way you sit or lie down can affect your pain. What may feel comfortable at first may be painful 15 or 20 minutes later. Family or friends can help you change position as often as you need. This will also reduce the risk of your skin becoming sore as a result of sitting or lying still in one position for long periods. Bedding may need to be tidied or changed, too. You may feel a lot better when you get back into a cool bed with fresh 50Controlling cancer pain bed linen. V-shaped pillows or supports can help reduce backache and neckache, and a bed cradle can keep the weight of blankets off weak limbs. Your district nurse may be able to provide you with a special mattress and cushions. Other people from your care team, such as a physiotherapist or occupational therapist, can provide special equipment to help with movement and sitting. Hot or cold Heat pads and warm baths can relax muscles, reduce joint stiffness and help relieve aches and pains. Ice packs can help relieve pain where there is inflammation and swelling. Some people find that alternating heat with cold is more helpful for controlling their pain. Care should always be taken to protect the skin from burns when using heat pads and ice packs. Heat pads should be used with a fleece cover, and ice packs should be wrapped in a towel before placing them near the skin. Heat shouldn't be used on body areas that are already inflamed or swollen, as it can make the swelling worse. Massage Gentle massage can help relieve aching backs or limbs. By rubbing the painful area, you will help reduce the number of painful messages reaching the brain, and you will also help the muscles relax. Unscented oils and lotions can also help keep your skin soft and supple. Massage and the use of oils and lotions should be avoided in areas that are either being treated with radiotherapy or have recently been treated. You may also need to be careful if you have cancer in the bones, as even gentle rubbing on those 51Controlling cancer pain areas may make the pain worse. If the number of platelets in your blood is low, you will be more likely to bruise. In this case, you may be advised not to have some types of massage until the number of platelets in your blood has increased. Occupying your mind Watching TV, reading, playing computer games, listening to music or chatting to a friend will not make your pain go away, but it can help distract you, at least for a time. Sitting in a chair or lying in bed with nothing to do can become depressing, and even short periods of entertainment can help you feel better and help you cope better with your pain. Short, regular visits from friends and relatives are probably better than longer ones. They are less tiring, help break up the day and are something to look forward to. Practical support and information You may be anxious about your treatment or worried about coping at home. You may have financial problems. Often, friends or relatives can help by getting more information from doctors and nurses or by finding out about services that can help. Sometimes there is little that they can say or do, but just being there to listen and understand can be enough. If you're not sure where to turn to for more information or would like to know more about services that can help, you could call our cancer support specialists on 0808 808 00 00 . They will be able to listen to you and can help point you to the services that can help. 52Controlling cancer pain 53Controlling cancer pain Control of other cancer symptoms People with cancer may have a wide variety of symptoms - some of them due to cancer, others caused by its treatment. Trying to cope with other symptoms may make it more difficult to cope with your pain. Often, other symptoms can be relieved by medical or non-medical treatments or by a combination of both. If your other symptoms are well controlled, this can help you deal more effectively with your pain. We can send you a booklet on controlling the symptoms of cancer. Tiredness (fatigue) Pain may feel worse if you're very tired, and fatigue (feeling exhausted all or most of the time) is a common and difficult problem for people with cancer. It can have a number of different causes. Fatigue may be due to your treatment, the cancer or other symptoms you may have. There are different ways of treating fatigue depending on the cause, so always let your doctor know how you're feeling. There are also steps you can take to make it easier to cope, such as saving your energy for the things that are most important to you. This may mean being more willing to accept help from other people or making simple changes to the way you do things around the home. 54Controlling cancer pain Some research has found that exercise and keeping active can help raise energy levels, but it's important that you don't feel that you have to exercise or keep going if you are too tired or are in pain. We have a booklet called Coping with fatigue , which gives useful information and suggestions on how to deal with this problem. Sleep disturbances Most people with cancer have trouble sleeping at some time during their illness. Sleeplessness may be due to anxiety, fears about the future or disturbed sleep patterns. If you feel tired and doze during the day, you're likely to find it harder to sleep at night. Pain is another reason for disturbed sleep, but it can be helped with good pain control. Although getting to sleep may be the hardest thing to do, you may also notice that you wake early - often around 3am or 4am - and find it difficult to get back to sleep if you're depressed. Most sleeping tablets only work for a few hours to help people get to sleep, so they will not help if you wake in the early hours of the morning. Relaxation, counselling and simply talking through the cause of any anxiety may be helpful for some people. It can help if you establish a regular routine at bedtime and go to bed at the same time each night. Try a warm, milky drink before bed. Have a warm bath with a few drops of lavender or geranium oil to help you relax, or sprinkle a couple of drops on your pillow. 55Controlling cancer pain If you can't sleep or if you wake up early, try to relax and not worry about it. Rather than lying in bed tossing and turning, get up and watch TV or read a book. Wait until you feel tired again and then go back to bed. Story tapes or CDs, which are stocked in most public libraries, may also help you fall asleep. Older people and people who have not been very physically active during the day need less sleep at night. If you are napping during the day and having problems sleeping at night, it may mean you do not need so much rest. See if it helps to limit yourself to one rest or sleep each day. If you're taking steroid tablets, these can interfere with your sleep if taken in the evening or at bedtime. You may find it better to take steroids during the morning, unless your doctor advises otherwise. Sometimes a short course of sleeping pills may help re-establish a more normal sleeping pattern and can get you over a particularly difficult patch.56Controlling cancer pain Practical support If your pain means that you can't move around easily, you may need specialist equipment or people to help you in your daily life. The British Red Cross (see page 75) has a branch in every county, and their volunteers can help you in many ways, including shopping, posting letters and changing library books. They also lend equipment, such as wheelchairs and commodes, for nursing someone at home, and they can provide you with a trained volunteer helper if you need help going places such as the hospital. If your pain is causing any kind of disability, there are many organisations that provide equipment that can help you. The Disabled Living Foundation (see page 76) runs a helpful information service. It also has specialist advisers and occupational therapists who can give personal advice on aids and specialist equipment, including special cutlery, walking aids and wheelchairs. DIAL UK also gives information and advice to disabled people (see page 76). Good neighbour scheme Some areas have a 'good neighbour scheme'. The schemes can organise help - for example, shopping, providing company or offering transport - for someone living locally every so often. These schemes are usually run by the social services or local community organisations. Some are only available to people living alone. Look for 'Council for Voluntary Service' or 'Volunteer Bureau' in the phone book or online. 57Controlling cancer pain Financial help and benefits If you are employed and unable to work, your employer can pay you Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) for a maximum of 28 weeks. If you are still unable to work after this period, you may be able to claim Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). There are two parts to ESA: a contributory part, which is dependent on how much national insurance you have paid, and a means- tested part, which is dependent on your income and savings. You may get either or both parts. ESA is paid at a basic rate for the first 13 weeks. During this time, you'll have to take part in a work capability assessment and attend a work-focused interview. After the 13-week period you'll be assessed and placed into one of two groups. If you are found to have limited capability for work you'll be placed in the support group, and if you are found not to have limited capability for work you'll be placed in the work-related activity group. If you are receiving radiotherapy or intravenous (by injection into a vein) chemotherapy, you will automatically be assessed as having limited capability for work and will be placed in the support group. People in the work-related activity group will have to attend six more work-focused interviews, which aim to help them get back into work. An additional payment will be paid to anyone in the support group, and a small additional payment will be paid to anyone in the work-related activity group. 58Controlling cancer pain If you are self-employed you can claim ESA as long as you have paid the correct level of national insurance contributions. People who have not paid these may qualify for ESA under the means-tested route. If you are ill and not able to claim, remember to ask your GP for a medical certificate for the period of your illness. If you are in hospital, ask your doctor or nurse for a certificate to cover the time that you are an inpatient. This is necessary if you need to claim a benefit. You may qualify for Disability Living Allowance (DLA) if you are under 65 or for Attendance Allowance (AA) if you are over 65. There is a fast-track claim for people who may not live longer than six months. People who claim under this 'special rule' need to get their doctor to complete a form for either benefit. It's impossible to tell exactly how long someone with cancer may live, and many people with advanced cancer may be entitled to this benefit. Special rules payments of AA and the DLA care component are reviewed after three years. Information about benefits and financial help For more information about benefits and financial support, please call us on 0808 808 00 00 . You may also find our booklet Help with the cost of cancer useful. You can find out more about benefits from your local Citizens Advice or by calling the Benefit Enquiry Line on 0800 882 200 . You can also visit the Department for Work and Pensions website at dwp.gov.uk 59Controlling cancer pain Direct payments If your assessment shows you need social services, you may be entitled to get direct payments from your local authority. This means that you are given payments to organise social services yourself, rather than the local social services paying for and organising them for you. You can get more information about direct payments from the Department of Health website at dh.gov.uk or from your local authority. Insurance After having treatment for cancer, it can be more difficult to get life or travel insurance. An independent financial adviser (IFA) can help you with life insurance and can find the best deal for your particular situation. You can find a local IFA by referral from family or friends, by looking in your phone book or by contacting The Personal Finance Society (see page 71) or Independent Financial Advisers Promotions (see page 70). We can send you more information about travel and cancer. We also have a booklet about getting travel insurance, which has a list of companies who offer insurance to people with medical conditions including cancer.
