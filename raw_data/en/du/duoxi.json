She found healing through integrative medicine, a practice that combines traditional Western medicine with the best, science-based practices in complementary and alternative medicine. Integrative medicine deals with the whole patient: lifestyle choices and the mind-body connection. Maloof, who is graduating in May, wanted to learn more and share what she learned with other medical students, so she invited Dr. Michele Couri, one of central Illinois' leading integrative physicians, to participate in a lecture series for medical students. Nearly 40 medical students attended Couri's lecture and a number commented afterward that the material was new to them, not covered in their medical school curriculum. Few students had ever heard of Dr. Andrew Weil, a pioneer of integrative medicine. Couri, a graduate of the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Peoria, will graduate in December from a two-year fellowship with Weil at the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine, University of Arizona. She has been in private practice in Peoria for more than 10 years. \"Integrative medicine looks at solutions that are not pharmaceutically driven,\" Couri said. Principles of macronutrition are applied for disease prevention. The anti-inflammatory diet is foundational to integrative medicine, Couri said. She has revamped her offices from what was once a traditional obstetrics and gynecology practice to the Couri Center for Gynecology and Integrative Women's Health. She takes a dietary history with all patients and discusses how to move toward the anti-inflammatory diet. In addition to a physician, the center has a nutritionist, fitness consultant, massage therapist, energy healer and certified Reiki specialist. On Saturdays, a meditation specialist who trained with Dr. Deepak Chopra leads a meditation session. Monthly cooking classes cover topics from clean eating, soups and raw food to gluten-free food, vegetarian and vegan diets and holiday meal preparation. All specialists work in concert. \"Medicine in this country is profit driven not outcome driven. We bow down to 'Big Pharma,'\" Couri said during an interview. That does not mean she has given up on Western medicine and medications. She explains she has \"expanded her toolbox\" to help patients heal. She still provides traditional treatments and surgical services, including hysterectomies, but she also looks to food as medicine. \"Integrative medicine needs to become the model in order for medicine to be sustainable. The burden of chronic disease is bankrupting our system,\" she said, explaining that diet and exercise are low-tech, inexpensive ways to avoid disease. The risk of developing diabetes, heart disease, cancer and even Alzheimer's disease is mitigated with the anti-inflammatory diet, Couri believes. In her lecture, \"Food is Medicine,\" Couri cited a study indicating that for every 20 percent increase in consumption of fruits and vegetables, there is a 20 percent reduction in cancer risk. But for every 20 percent increase in cruciferous vegetables, there is a 40 percent reduction in cancer risk. \"Good nutrition can basically change or alter the function of our genes,\" she said. \"Good food can turn genes on or off. Good food can change how disease progresses.\" Couri said physicians are essentially teachers for their patients. She recently saw a patient with severe rheumatoid arthritis. The woman was in constant pain. \"I asked her if any doctor had ever talked with her about diet. She said no. She did not know about the anti-inflammatory diet, did not know how food choices can affect her pain, did not know the difference between good fats and bad fats,\" Couri said. \"The typical American diet is very pro-inflammatory. The anti-inflammatory diet is a hybrid of the Mediterranean diet and the Japanese diet.\" Couri recommends that her patients avoid processed, manufactured foods. She said processed foods labeled \"low-fat\" often remove fat and replace it with pro-inflammatory carbohydrates. For more information, contact the Couri Center for "}
