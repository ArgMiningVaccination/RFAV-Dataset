Smith, PhD,1,2Alicia DrPH1 Abstract Objectives: The prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among women in the United States is high. Little is known about how CAM use may differ based on sexual orientation. Study aims were tomeasure the prevalence of CAM use in a community sample of women, explore differences in CAM use patternsby sexual orientation, and identify correlates of CAM use.Design/subjects: Analyses were based on women (Total N\u00bc879; n\u00bc479 lesbians) enrolled in the Epidemiologic STudy of HEalthRisk in Women (ESTHER) Project, a cross-sectional heart-disease risk-factor study. Settings/location: Data were collected through convenience sampling of adult females in Pittsburgh, PA (2003- 2006).Outcome measures: Main outcome measures included lifetime and past 12-month CAM use, and types of CAM modalities used in the past 12 months.Results: The prevalence of having ever used CAM was 49.8%, with 42% having reported CAM use within the past 12 months. Lesbians had greater odds of having ever used CAM (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] \u00bc1.68 [95% condence interval (CI): 1.23, 2.28]) and of having used CAM in the past 12 months (AOR \u00bc1.44 [CI: 1.06, 1.97]) than heterosexuals. In multivariate analyses, correlates of lifetime and past 12-month CAM use included being lesbian, white, higher educated, and a large-city resident; experiencing perceived discrimination in a health caresetting; and having a greater spirituality rating and a history of a diagnosed mental health disorder. Past 12-month CAM use was also associated with having a provider of usual health care. Among women who usedCAM within the past 12 months, heterosexuals had signicantly higher yoga participation rates than lesbians.Conclusions: Sexual orientation is important in understanding lifetime and past 12-month CAM use. Because of the high prevalence of CAM use found in this study, medical practitioners should inquire about the CAMpractices of female patients, particularly lesbians. Introduction Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) re- fers to a variety of health practices considered to be outside the traditional domain of conventional Western medicine.1Since the 1990s, rates of CAM use among Ameri- cans have increased steadily to the present rate of 38%.1-3In 2007, it was estimated that Americans spent $33.9 billion on out-of-pocket CAM-related therapies, products, andclasses.4T h ee x t a n tr e s e a r c hs u g g e s t st h a tC A Mu s ei s associated with individual attempts to improve generalhealth, 5treat specic health conditions such as back pain6 and migraines,7and complement conventional medical treatment of life-threatening illnesses as cancer8-9and human immunodeciency virus/acquired immunode-ciency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). 10-11 In the United States, common types of CAM therapies include natural products, mind-body medicine, manipulative 1Department of Epidemiology, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA. 2Center for Research on Health Care, Division of General Internal Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA. 3Department of Health System Sciences, College of Nursing, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL. 4Department of Biostatistics, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA.THE JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE Volume 16, Number 11, 2010, pp. 1161-1170\u00aaMary Ann Liebert, Inc. DOI: body-based practices, movement therapies, and whole medical systems.1A myriad of factors have been shown to influence CAM usage, including demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Researchers nd thatCAM use may increase with age and that women tend to use CAM more frequently than men. 12Current statistics suggest that women between ages 30 and 69 are the primary con-sumers of CAM. 2,5,12-14Results from the 2007 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) indicate that, among adults, native Americans or indigenous Alaskan people (50.3%) and whites(43.1%) reported higher rates of CAM use than Asians (39.9%)or African-Americans (25.5%). 12Among U.S. women who use CAM, reasons for using CAM may differ by race/ethnicity. A study by Chao et al. showed that, when asked what influ-enced their decision to use CAM, non-Hispanic white women noted personal beliefs, Mexican-American women cited the high cost of conventional medicine, and African-Americanwomen reported having read or heard something about CAM on the radio or television. 15 Sexual orientation may also play a role in CAM use among women. The two published studies exploring the relation-ship between sexual orientation and CAM use suggest that sexual orientation may influence overall prevalence rates and motivation of CAM use. 11,16London et al. assessed past 6 month use of alternative therapists by sexual orientation among individuals with HIV/AIDS, and found that a com- bined sample of gay and lesbian patients had greater odds ofhaving used CAM therapists than heterosexual patients (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] \u00bc1.95; 95% condence interval [CI]\u00bc1.25, 3.05). 11The data from this study are consistent with the extant literature suggesting higher rates of CAM use among medical populations and also indicate that sexual orientation may influence CAM use. However, it is unclearhow these ndings generalize to nonclinical samples andhow use patterns may differ between gay men and lesbians. In a second study, Matthews and colleagues examined the relationship between sexual orientation and CAM useamong a community sample of women. Information about rates and types of CAM modalities used was collected as part of a larger survey of lesbian and heterosexual women'shealth. Overall, 82% of the sample reported any lifetime CAM use. Even after controlling for age, education, race, and health status, lesbians were signicantly more likely to haveused CAM therapies, compared to their heterosexual coun-terparts ( p\u00bc0.039). 16This study made an important contri- bution to the literature by demonstrating an association between sexual orientation and CAM use among a nonclin-ical sample of women. However, this study was limited to a narrow denition of CAM use. Preliminary evidence suggests that CAM use may differ based on sexual orientation. A potential explanation for these ndings is that lesbians may face barriers to accessing cultur- ally competent and appropriate health care services. Thesebarriers may include lower rates of health insurance cover- age, 17lower average income levels, and higher rates of actual or perceived discriminatio ni nh e a l t hc a r es e t t i n g s .16,18Lesbians may also have a higher prevalence of health-related conditionsthat have been associated with increased CAM use, such as depression and anxiety. 19In addition, research is needed to gain a better understanding of rates and correlates of CAM useamong community samples of women and to identify how these factors may differ based on sexual orientation.Specic aims The overall objective of the current study was to estimate the prevalence and correlates of CAM use among a large community-based sample of women enrolled in a women's health research study, the ESTHER ( Epidemiologic Study of HEalthRisk in Women) Project. Specic aims were to: (1) determine the prevalence of CAM use (lifetime, past 12- month, and past 12-month use of specic CAM modalities);(2) determine if the prevalence of CAM use differed betweenlesbian and heterosexual women; and (3) identify correlates of lifetime and past 12-month CAM use. To address these specic aims, secondary data analyses were performed ondata collected as part of the ESTHER Project. Study ndings have important implications for understanding how sexual minority status may affect CAM use among nonclinicalsamples of women. Materials and Methods Study design and data collection The sample population for this analysis was selected from 1084 participants ( n\u00bc503 lesbians) enrolled in the ESTHER Project at the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA) be- tween 2003 and 2006. The purpose of the ESTHER Project was to conduct a cross-sectional study that examined dif-ferences in heart-disease risk factors among women in the Pittsburgh, PA area. The main results of the ESTHER Project are currently in preparation for publication. Although effortswere made to recruit a diverse sample of women, the con- venience sampling method applied resulted in unequal proportions of selected subgroups of women. Data reductionwas conducted systematically to adjust for factors known tobe signicantly associated with health status, specically age and race, leaving a sample for analysis that allowed for comparisons by the primary aim of the study, namely sexualorientation. To address the highly skewed distribution of older heterosexuals compared to older lesbians only indi- viduals who were <65 years old were included for analysis, resulting in 1008 participants. Women who did not identify as African-American or white were excluded ( n\u00bc29) from analysis, given the insufcient power to predict differencesamong other racial groups. To address the disproportionate low rate of accrual among African-American lesbians (n\u00bc38), African-American heterosexuals were then ran- n\u00bc32) in the same proportion as African- American lesbians who were recruited into the study. The data sample of 879 remained for analysis and included 38 African-American lesbians, 441 white lesbians, 32 African-American heterosexuals, and 368 white heterosexuals. The study population for our CAM analysis was based on 879 (n\u00bc479 lesbian) women who participated in the ESTHER Project. Because of missing values the sample size for lifetime used CAM was n\u00bc878 (Table 1) and CAM use within the past 12 months was n\u00bc877 (Table 2). Recruitment Questions of sampling and generalizability are known methodological limitations when working with hidden communities, such as lesbian women. 20-22Obtaining a probability sample of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons is difcult and costly. As such, much LGBT1162 SMITH ET AL.Table 1.Demographic and Health Characteristics and Unadjusted Odds Ratios of Lifetime History of Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Among Lesbian and Heterosexual Women Enrolled in the ESTHER Project, Pittsburgh , PA, 2003-2006 Lifetime CAM use (ever used CAM) ( Variable No ( n,%) Yes 163 (40.8) 0.034 35-39 69 (54.8) 57 (45.2) (52.3) 1.33 (0.86, 2.65) 55-64 85 91 (51.7) 1.30 (0.82, <0.0001 389 (48.1) 419 (51.9) Reference African American 52 (74.3) 18 (25.7) 0.32 (0.19, 0.56) Education ( N\u00bc878) <0.0001 High school or less 73 (78.5) 20 (21.5) Reference Some college 124 (58.5) 88 (41.5) 2.59 (1.47, 4.56) Bachelors 100 (46.1) 117 (53.9) 4.27 (2.43,7.49)Graduate (45.0) 0.96 (0.61, 1.52) (39.6) 67 (60.4) 1.79 (1.07, 3.01) $75,000 \u00fe 143 (49.3) 147 status ( n\u00bc878) 0.944 Excellent 245 (50.3) 242 (49.7) Reference Good 150 (49.7) 152 (50.3) 1.03 (0.77, 1.37) Poor 46 (51.7) 43 (48.3) 0.95 n\u00bc878) <1 Year ago 332 (51.5) 313 (48.5) Reference >1-2 Years ago 62 (46.3) 72 (53.7) 1.23 (0.85, 1.79) >2 Years or don't know 47 (47.5) 52 (52.5) 1.17 (0.77, 1.79) Have provider of usual care ( n\u00bc877) 0.001 No 99 (61.9) 61 (38.1) Reference Yes 341 (47.6) 376 (52.4) 1.79 (1.26, 2.54) Perceived discriminated in a health care establishment ( n\u00bc878)<0.0001 No 405 (53.6) 350 (46.4) Reference Yes 36 (29.3) 87 (70.7) 2.80 (1.85, 4.23) Health insurance coverage ( n\u00bc876) 0.656 Uninsured 36 (52.9) 32 (47.1) Reference Insured 405 (50.1) 403 (49.9) 1.12 (0.68, 1.84) (0.43, Spirituality ( (52.0) 142 (48.0) 1.10 (1.39, 2.84) Diagnosed with:Heart-related condition ( n\u00bc875) 0.24 No 240 (52.2) 220 (47.8) Reference Yes 200 (48.2) 215 (51.8) 1.17 (0.90, ReferenceYes 30 (51.6) 1.06 (0.63, 1.78) Autoimmune disorder ( n\u00bc876) 0.057 No 278 (52.9) 248 (47.2) ReferenceYes 162 (46.3) 188 (53.7) 1.30 (0.99, 1.71) (continued)CAM USE AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION 1163research has been conducted with volunteer and conve- nience samples.23Participants for the current study were recruited, using a variety of methods shown to increase re- cruitment of hard-to-reach populations: news transgender (LGBT) events and socials; and the University of Pittsburgh broadcast phone-message system. Participantswere eligible to participate in the ESTHER Project if theywere at /C2135, identied as a lesbian or heterosexual woman, and had no previous history of heart disease (angina, heart attack, and/or stroke). All instruments and the study pro-tocol were approved by the institutional review board at the University of Pittsburgh. Signed written consent was ob- tained from each participant. Data collection Trained research staff members conducted recruitment/ screening calls and scheduled individuals who met eligibilitycriteria for two clinic visits as part of study participation. The rstvisit was conducted at Magee Womens Hospital (Pittsburgh, PA), where a series of questionnaires, a physical activity inter- view, a 2-week medication history interview, and fasting blooddraws were completed. The second visit included a review of completed 3-day food diaries a nd a dual-energy X-ray absorp- tiometry (DEXA) scan of the hip, spine, and whole body. Allinformation used in this analysis was obtained from the re- cruitment call forms and interviewer-administered (paper/ pencil) questionnaires completed at the rst clinic visit. Measures: Dependent variables History of CAM use was dened by self-reported use of lifetime and past 12-month history of alternative health ser- vices. Lifetime CAM use was measured by the followingquestion: ''Have you ever sought help from any type of alternative health services, such as traditional healing, acupuncture, massage, or herbal therapies? (Exclude clergy and chiropractors).'' Past 12- month CAM use was measured by the following question: ''Have you sought help from any type of alternative health services in the last 12 months?'' If participants answered ''yes,'' they were asked to select which of the following were used in the last yoga or other. Measures: Independent variables All independent variables for analysis were selected based on previous reported research and included demographic,health-related, and psychosocial variables. 5,8,11,16,24-27 Demographics. Sexual orientation, age, and race were obtained from screening/recruitment forms. Other demo-graphic factors including years of education, total household income, health insurance coverage, and primary residence (large city or not large city) were taken from the question-naires completed at the rst clinic visit. Sexual orientation. There is no accepted gold standard to assess sexual orientation; however, sexual orientation is gen- erally understood as a person's predisposition toward sexual attraction to persons of the same sex, opposite sex, or bothsexes. 28Similar to other studies of lesbian health,16,29-30the measure of sexual orientation used for the current study was based on sexual attraction, identity, and behavior. Hetero- sexuals were dened as those who self-identied as hetero-sexual or straight andonly had male sexual partners since the age of 18. Lesbians were dened as women who did not identify as heterosexual or straight; and had emotional, physical, and romantic attractions within the past 5 years to- ward only or primarily women orwhose relationships within the past 5 years had been with only or primarily women. Discrimination in a health care setting. Participants were asked in the form of three questions whether they had ever experienced discrimination while getting medical care. Thethree domains queried included race, gender, and sexual ori- entation. For analysis, these questions were categorized into one dichotomous variable that assessed overall perceived dis-crimination in a health care setting (0 \u00bcno perceived discrim- ination versus 1 \u00bcany perceived discrimination). Spirituality. Individuals were asked to rate their level of spirituality on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (not spiritual atTable 1.

Higher scores represented greater reported spirituality, and this variable was collapsed into three categories as follows: (1) not at all or somewhat spiri-tual (1-3); spiritual (4); and very spiritual (5). Self-rated health status. Participants were asked to rate their health status on a 6-point continuum from excellent to very poor. This variable was collapsed into three categories: excellent (excellent, very good); good (good); and poor (fair,poor, and very poor). Health care behaviors. The two health care behaviors examined included length of time since last routine checkup and having a usual source of health care. The length of timesince last routine doctor's visit was categorized as follows: <1 year ago; 1-2 years ago; and /C212 years ago or do not know. Source of usual health care by a clinic, doctor, nurse orphysician's assistant was reported as Yes or No, and coded as such. Health-related conditions and illnesses. To examine the association of specic health conditions with CAM use, participants self-report of diagnosed medical conditions were categorized into heart-related conditions (high bloodpressure (BP), high cholesterol, high triglycerides, obesity, diabetes, angina, heart attack, heart disease, stroke); cancer (breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer,other cancer (specied); autoimmune disorders (over- or underactive emphysema, or and mental health diagnoses (eating disorder [anorexia, bulimia], depression, anxiety). Stomach ulcers andHIV/AIDS were not included in the categories but wereincluded in the analysis as independent conditions. Statistical analysis Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests for comparison of proportions,means, and statistical signicance. Variables identied as signicant ( p<0.05) in unadjusted analyses were included in regression models. Tests of collinearity were performed andvariables that had a variance inflation factor (VIF) of >10 were removed. Backward logistic regression models were used to examine the association between sexual orientationand CAM use, adjusting for potential confounders. Statistical signicance for multiple logistic regression models was de- ned as p<0.05. No signicant and relevant interactions were found. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC)curve and Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic were used to evaluate the overall model t. All statistical analyses were performed using the SAS system for Windows, version 9.2 (SAS In-stitute, Cary, NC). Results The sample was 92.0% ( n\u00bc809) white and highly edu- cated with 65.3% of the sample holding a bachelor's degree or higher. Approximately half of the sample was identiedas lesbian (54.5%, n\u00bc479). Age, race, and household income did not signicantly differ by sexual orientation. The mean age of the sample was 47.8 and 47.4, for heterosexuals and lesbians, respectively. Approximately 49.8% ( n\u00bc437) of all participants reported they had used CAM in their lifetimes and about 42.4% ( n\u00bc372) reported CAM use in the past 12 months. Bivariate analyses As shown in Tables 1 and 2, lesbians had signicantly greater odds of having ever used CAM (57.3% versus 40.8%;p<0.0001) and to have used CAM in the past 12 months (47.6% versus 36.3%; p<0.001) than heterosexual women. Additional demographic variables signicantly associatedwith ever having used CAM included: older age; white race; more years of education; and residence in a large city. Other factors signicantly associated with having ever used CAMincluded: perceived discrimination in a health care setting;Table 2.

Signicant self-reported medical conditions associated with having ever used CAM were mental health-related disorders, respiratory disorders, andstomach ulcers. Bivariate results for CAM use within the past 12 months were very similar to ever having used CAM, except that ageand having been diagnosed with a respiratory disorder were not signicantly associated with CAM use. The most common CAM modalities used by women were massage (71.4%), yoga (31.9%), meditation (25.4%), andherbal medicines (24.1%). Among women who used CAM within the past 12 months ( n\u00bc372) only yoga participation signicantly varied by sexual orientation, with heterosexualwomen having higher rates of yoga participation ( p\u00bc0.002) than lesbians. See Table 3. Multivariate analyses Multivariate logistic regression analysis concluded that sexual orientation (AOR \u00bc1.68, 95% CI [1.23, 2.28]) was an independent predictor of having ever used CAM after ad-justing for potential covariates (Table 4). Other signicantcovariates associated with ever having used CAM included white race, more years of education, perceived experience of discrimination in a medical establishment, residence in alarge city, being very spiritual, and having a history of a diagnosed mental health disorder. The Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness of Fit Test showed the main effects model was agood t for the data ( p\u00bc0.52). The overall classication rate was good, ROC area \u00bc0.726. Logistic regression analysis for CAM use within the past 12 months produced similar re-sults. Lesbians had greater odds of having used CAM in thepast 12 months (AOR \u00bc1.44, 95% CI [1.06, 1.97], compared to heterosexual women. The Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness of Fit Test showed the main effects model was a good t for thedata ( p\u00bc0.88). The overall classication rate was good, ROC area\u00bc0.726. Given the potential interaction of sexual orientation with other factors in the multivariable models, the data were also tested for interactions between sexual orientation and other predictor variables on lifetime and 12-month CAM use.Statistical testing did not reveal any evidence of interaction (data not shown). Discussion These ndings are among very few reported, examining the differences in CAM use between heterosexual and les- bian women. Secondary data analysis was performed among ESTHER Project participants to determine the prevalence ofCAM use, assess differences of CAM use by sexual orienta-tion, and identify factors associated with CAM use. The overall prevalence of having ever used CAM was 49.8% and having used CAM in the past 12 months was 42.4%, whichconcur with reports by other studies. 3,5,24,31-32Lesbians had higher prevalence rates of lifetime (57.3% versus 40.8%) and past 12-month (47.6% vs. 36.3%) CAM use than heterosexualwomen; however, the type of CAM use among those who used CAM within the past 12 months varied little by sexual orientation. After adjusting for other factors, sexual orienta-tion was found to be independently associated with CAM use ever and within the past 12 months. This complements ndings by Matthews et al., whose multivariate analysisrevealed that a lesbian sexual orientation was an indepen-dent predictor of CAM use. 16Aside from sexual orientation, the current multivariate results concurred with previous ndings in that CAM use was associated with: whiterace 27,33-34; increasing years of education5,27,35; residence in a large city5; perceived experience of discrimination in a health care setting16; and having been previously diagnosed with a mental health condition.36-37Being very spiritual was also associated with CAM use, which was similar to other studies that found CAM use was associated with religiosity,38 prayer for health-related reasons,5,25,39and spirituality.25 The current multivariate results also showed that those who had providers of usual health care, compared to those who did not, had greater odds of CAM use within the past 12months. At rst, this may seem to contradict the current nding that patients who experienced discrimination in a health care setting had greater odds of CAM use. One mayassume that patients who reported discrimination in a medi- cal establishment may have lower rates of having a current health care provider.

Among CAM users, both those who reported discrimination in a health care setting and those who did not had similar rates of having a current provider (89.6% and 86.9%). This may be the result ofmeasuring lifetime discrimination and current provider of usual care. Perhaps those who experienced discrimination in a health care setting no longer attended the practices where the events occurred, but may currently have providers of usualcare. Further investigation is needed into the unique rela- tionship between lifetime discrimination in a health care set- ting and current status of having a usual health care provider. The current results diverge from published studies in sev- eral ways. The current research did not nd age to be a sig- nicant predictor of CAM use after adjusting for othercovariates. Age as a predictor of CAM use has revealed mixedresults across studies. 27The current results may reflect the limited age range (35-64) of women in the ESTHER Project. Inaddition, unlike some studies, the current analysis did not nd associations between having been diagnosed with canceror HIV/AIDS and CAM use (ever and past 12 months); however, this may reflect the small sample of individuals who reported a cancer ( n\u00bc62) or HIV/AIDS ( n\u00bc11) diagnosis. Although the current ndings contribute to investigations of CAM use, these results should be interpreted in light of several limitations. Although recruitment for the ESTHER Project consisted of a range of strategies designed to obtain adiverse cross-section of lesbian and heterosexual women, the convenience-sampling frame used introduced the possibility that results may not be representative of the general popu-lation of women. These current results also represent women who revealed their sexual identity, attractions, and rela- tionships to research staff members, therefore, only lesbianswho were willing to self-identify were classied as lesbians.Given the more stringent criteria for classication of het- erosexual women, it is unlikely that bisexual or lesbianTable 4.Adjusted Odds Ratios of Lifetime History and Past 12-Month Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Use Among Lesbian and Heterosexual Women, ESTHER Project, Pittsburgh, PA, 2003-2006 Ever used Used past 12 months Variable AOR (95% CI) p AOR (1.23, 2.28) 1.44 1.97) Race <0.001 <0.0001 White Reference Reference 0.17 (0.08, 0.38) Education <0.0001 <0.0001 High school or less Perceived discriminated in a No Reference Reference Yes 2.48 (1.53, 4.03) 1.63 (1.03, 2.57) Residence 0.004 0.002 Large Reference Reference Not large city 0.86) 0.62 (0.45, 0.84) Spirituality <0.001 <0.0001 Reference Spiritual 1.03 (0.73, 1.45) 1.21 (0.86, 1.72) Very spiritual 2.27 (1.50, 3.44) 2.74 (1.83, 4.10) Have provider of usual care 0.005 No Reference Yes 1.81 (1.19, 2.76) Mental health-related condition 0.013 0.043 No Reference Reference Yes 1.48 (1.09, 2.02) 1.38 (1.01, 1.89) ESTHER, Epidemiologic STudy of HEalth Risk in Women; CI, condence interval; AOR, adjusted odds ratio.

The study popula- tion was primarily composed of middle-age white women. Differences in CAM use across the lifespan and among racial-minority heterosexual and lesbian women could notbe adequately investigated with the current sample. Other biases may have influenced these results. Because healthy, highly educated individuals with more expendabletime tend to participate in research more frequently than individuals with signicant illnesses, less education, or with limited expendable time, volunteer bias could be present.Furthermore, like other CAM studies, the lack of a standarddenition of CAM use in research made the current results more difcult to compare with those of other studies. Be- cause the main purpose of the ESTHER Project was to collectinformation on CHD risk factors, the denition of CAM use in the current study was limited to lifetime and past 12- month use and did not include information on chiropracticservices or religious prayer, both of which may have con- tributed to an increased measure of CAM use. Other general features of CAM research that make results difcult tocompare across studies include the timeline selected to ex-amine CAM use 3,16,24; whether CAM is dened by self- prescribed use3,24or by use of a CAM practitioner10; whether participants use CAM in conjunction with or in place ofconventional medicine 3,24; and if the study population is from a general3,24or clinical population.10,40 Conclusions The presented ndings provide insight into the relation- ship between sexual orientation and CAM use in a healthy population of women, providing updated prevalence rates ofCAM use among lesbians, and using a broader denition ofCAM use reporting for heterosexual and lesbian women. The results of this study indicate that CAM use was prevalent among a nonclinical, community sample of women. Findingsalso suggest that lesbian women have greater odds than heterosexual women of having ever used CAM and of hav- ing used CAM in the past 12 months. Therefore, sexual ori-entation may play a role in understanding why some women choose to use CAM. Future studies to determine if reasons for seeking CAM care, modality of CAM use, and effect ofCAM use differ between heterosexual and lesbian women are warranted. Longitudinal studies would be ideal to ex- plain how life events, such as lack of health care insurance ordiagnoses of specic medical conditions, are associated withthe initiation or discontinuation of CAM use. Given the greater prevalence of CAM use reported by the lesbian wo- men, future research may focus on clinicians' understandingof CAM use among women and specically how CAM's relationship to sexual orientation is reflected in clinical prac- tices. Finally, a more focused investigation, designed to de-velop a better understanding of how and why lesbian women use CAM and to determine if specic CAM modal- ities are used more often in conjunction with, or in place of,conventional medicine would signicantly contribute to our understanding of CAM use among lesbians.
