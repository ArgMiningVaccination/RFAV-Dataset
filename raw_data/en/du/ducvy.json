Designs For Health 14 Day Detox/Cleanse Program One Kit Contains: 1 - PaleoCleanse Powder 1 - PurePea Vanilla Powder 1 - Amino-D-Tox 90 capsules 1 - Plant Enzymes Digestive Formula 90 capsules 1 - 14 Day Detox/Cleanse Patient Guide 1 - Blender bottle 1 - Reusable bag made from recyclable materials PRODUCT INFORMATION PurePea - Great-tasting vegetarian pea protein powder Recommended Dosage: As a dietary supplement, mix 30 grams (approx. 2 heaping scoops) in eight ounces of water or any other beverage per day, or as directed by your healthcare practitioner. Hypoallergenic Produced using no chemical solvents Non-GMO (not genetically modified) Grain-free Gluten-free Dairy-free Soy-free Fructose-free PurePea, a natural pea protein isolate, offers a high level of functionality and nutritional benefits. It is ideal for those who are looking for vegetarian protein and may not want dairy derived protein. PurePea is a true vegan protein which has high bioavailability and excellent digestibility. The raw materials, North American grown yellow peas, are not genetically modified (non-GMO). PurePea is extracted from these dry peas via a patented protein technology which uses no chemical solvents. Amino Acid Profile PurePea has an excellent array of amino acids, including high levels of BCAAs (branched chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine). While its amino acid profile is similar to whey protein, it is particularly high in arginine, lysine, and phenylalanine. Its well-balanced profile fulfills the essential amino acid requirements outlined by the World Health Organization for adults. Excellent Digestibility PurePea has excellent digestibility, a distinct advantage over other vegetable protein isolates, as it does not contain the commonly occurring anti-nutritional factors of other legumes (i.e., soy), mainly trypsin inhibitors, phytates, lectins, tannins, and -galactocides. (The presence of high levels of these anti-nutritional factors can cause substantial reductions in protein digestibility.) Benefits of Peas As pea protein has ACE inhibitory activity, it may have a positive effect on the maintenance of normal blood pressure levels. It has also been shown, in rat studies, to have a positive impact on total cholesterol and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) by stimulating bile acid formation and excretion. When compared to other vegetables, the yellow peas used in PurePea have low levels of phytosteroids (isoflavones), thus minimizing the possible estrogenic effects. PurePea: great protein source for athletes and anyone who is physically active Due to its favorable amino acid profile and high digestibility, PurePea is an excellent choice for consumption before, during, and after exercise. Adequate intake of protein, in particular BCAAs, helps to promote muscle growth and repair, particularly after strenuous resistance training. Vanilla flavored PurePea is sweetened with the natural herb stevia and mixes easily in any beverage of choice. Dairy Free The pea protein in PurePea is not a major allergen, and is, therefore, a safe alternative for people with allergies to milk and milk products who must avoid casein or whey proteins, for those with lactose intolerance, and for vegetarians with soy allergies. This product does not contain wheat, yeast, soy, gluten, eggs, dairy, corn, artificial colors, flavors, sugars or preservatives. PaleoCleanse Powder Recommended Use: As a dietary supplement, mix 18 grams (approx. one heaping scoop) in eight ounces of water or any other beverage per day, or as directed by your health care practitioner. May work up to 2 scoops for a deeper detox. PaleoCleanse is a comprehensive functional food powder ideal for detoxification. It is low in carbohydrates and has been assayed to reveal undetectable levels of lectins. The protein source is a natural pea protein isolate, providing an excellent array of amino acids including BCAAs (branched chain amino acids). It is particularly high in leucine, lysine, arginine, phenylalanine and tyrosine. It is also easy to digest. Pea protein has ACE inhibitory activity and may have a positive effect on the maintenance of normal blood pressure levels.[1] It has also been shown, in rat studies, to have a positive impact on total cholesterol and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) by stimulating bile acid formation and excretion.[2] PaleoCleanse contains quality macronutrients to fuel detoxification pathways, a full multivitamin/mineral for detoxification enzyme support, all the nutrients needed to support and balance phase I and II metabolic pathways, and high levels of antioxidant support for safe detoxification. This liver formula also contains the most comprehensive array of herbal hepatics, alteratives and cholagogues to promote optimal liver function and elimination. PaleoCleanse has a pleasant berry-vanilla flavor, a wonderful, smooth texture (mouth feel), and mixes easily in any beverage. It is free of dairy, gluten, fructose, and lactose, and is sweetened with the natural herb stevia.

Amino D-Tox Capsules Recommended Use:As a dietary supplement, take six capsules per day with meals or as directed by your health care practitioner. However, if for some reason this process does not agree with you, you can take the Amino D-Tox between meals. Amino-D-Tox was designed to biochemically upregulate phase II detoxification. It is free of herbals, minerals and B vitamins which would also upregulatephase I detoxification. Consumers who are chemically injured, who have chronic illness, and who are pathologic detoxifiers (blocked phase II pathways), will find that this product will gently upregulate all the conjugation pathways resulting in excretion of the pollutants without mobilizing more oxidized pollutants in the body from body fat stores.* These oxidized pollutants can be more toxic and harmful than the original substance. The phase II conjugating pathways must be prepared to deal with phase I metabolites before these pathways are stimulated. For repairing the liver's ability to detoxify chemicals, this product should be used before any other nutraceutical, or powdered detoxification formula, until the conjugating pathways are all working optimally. Serving Size: 180 vegetarian capsules Six capsules contain: Glycine.......500 Methylsulfonylmethane.......400 Calcium-D-Glucarate.......200 mg Other Ingredients: Microcrystalline cellulose, vegetable stearate. This formula is free of herbals, minerals and B vitamins so as to avoid upregulation of phase I enzymes. This product will gently upregulate all the conjugation pathways resulting in excretion of pollutants without mobilizing more oxidized pollutants in the body from body fat stores.* This product does not contain wheat, yeast, soy protein, gluten, eggs, dairy, corn, artificial colors, flavors, sugars, or preservatives. Plant Digestive Enzyme Formula Recommended Use: Take 2-5 capsules ideally just before each meal. They can also be taken during or after a meal. In order to assimilate vitamins and nutrients from our food and supplements, we must be able to digest them properly. Plant Enzyme Digestive Formula is a combination of the most important enzymes for digestion of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Applications include gas and bloating after meals, constipation, and a feeling of fullness after eating only a small quantity of food. Studies show that the foods in the typical American diet are devoid of natural enzymes and do little to help secrete our own production of enzymes. Thus, foods do not get digested well and nutrients from food are poorly absorbed. Poor digestive health can lead to many other disorders including asthma, osteoporosis, food allergies, depression and arthritis. Many health experts agree that regular consumption of enzymes and enzyme rich foods is a key to vibrant health, disease prevention, and anti-aging. Every cell in your body needs enzymes for its biochemical functions, thus a deficiency will accelerate the aging process! Plant Enzyme Digestive Formula does not contain any animal products. Benefits of Plant Enzymes Prevents Gas and Bloating Helps Digest Proteins, Fats, and Carbohydrates Replaces the missing enzymes from common foods which are destroyed while cooking. Relieves constipation Relieves digestive problems Increases absorption of vitamins and minerals from food.
