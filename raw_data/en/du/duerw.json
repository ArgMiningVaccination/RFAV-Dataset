The University of Massachusetts Medical School offers pathways to lead students to success in their future. The School of Medicine has four unique pathways to support students after matriculation. Each has its own process of admissions, as well as its own curriculum and requirements. CLINICAL TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH PATHWAY The Clinical Translational Research Pathway (CTRP) guides students toward understanding, treating and preventing human disease. The pathway puts graduates on the path to becoming leaders in clinical work, evidence -based medicine and research. It's done through hands -on training and small group coursework. \"The students in the Clinical Translational Research Pathway are all highly motivated and share the common goal of integrating medically relevant researc h into their careers as physicians,\" said Angela Essa, a first -year School of Medicine student in the CTRP. \"I was particularly interested in participating because of its emphasis on evidence -based medicine and the potential to gain new skills in interpr eting data and performing statistical analyses.\" Skills and background needed to take part in CTRP include epidemiology, biostatistics and cellular -molecular biology at a master's level. Students who don't have a master's degree when they come to UMMS ha ve the chance to earn their Master of Science in Clinical Investigation in the Graduate School of Biological Sciences. After five years, students in the CTRP can graduate with MD and MSCI degrees. GLOBAL HEALTH PATHWAY The Global Health Pathway (GHP) trains and supports students to become providers in global health. Students gain experience in clinical research and public health, with a focus on underserved pop ulations in and outside the United States.. The pathway teaches students about diseases, conditions and issues impacting global populations. \"We want to give our students a foundation in global and public health knowledge,\" said Anindita Deb, MD, assistan t professor of neurology, associate program director of neurology residency, and director of global neurology initiative. \"They have exposure to a new environment, learning about underserved populations in a global setting. Students can work on understand ing resources, cultural competency and healthcare within these communities.\" There are capstone and longitudinal project opportunities through the GHP. Students have traveled to Kenya, Ecuador and beyond to work with staff in partner sites.
