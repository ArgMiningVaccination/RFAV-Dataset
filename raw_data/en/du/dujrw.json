The legislation also requires the California Air Resources Board (ARB) to establish a demonstration program to showcase these technologies statewide. AB 998 requires ARB to impose a three-dollar ($3) per gallon fee on the importers of Perc for dry cleaning operations commencing January 1, 2004. This fee will increase one-dollar ($1) per gallon per year from 2005 through 2013. Fee collection will continue until all uses of Perc for dry cleaning in California are phased out. As required by the legislation, the majority of the funds collected by the fee will be used to provide $10,000 grants to assist dry cleaners in switching to non-toxic and non-smog forming cleaning technologies such as wet cleaning and carbon dioxide (CO2) cleaning. The balance of funds will be used to establish the demonstration program.
