Children's early environmental influences shape their developing [brain architecture](https://developingchild.harvard.edu/science/key-concepts/brain-architecture/) and strongly affect whether they grow up to be healthy, productive members of society. This working paper from the [National Scientific Council on the Developing Child](https://developingchild.harvard.edu/science/national-scientific-council-on-the-developing-child/) explains why it is important that society thinks carefully about young children's early surroundings and experiences.
