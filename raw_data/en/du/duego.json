The reason for this may lie in the changing nature of the disease, which has received little attention. This paper examines scientific studies of the disease from a yin-yang perspective, and presents an entirely new mechanism in which the disease changes from a \"hot\" or \"yin-deficient\" state to a \"cold\" or \"yang-deficient\" state, or vice versa. Therefore, treatment of the disease needs to be adjusted accordingly. Furthermore, this paper identifies a drug lead based on the \"hot\" and \"cold\" properties of some well-known memory-enhancing herbs.............KEYWORDS: Alzheimer's disease; Yin-deficient; Yang-deficient; Medical mechanism; Treatment; Memory-enhancing herbs; Traditional Chinese medicine, Glossary.", "sitename": "\\\"Evolutionary Progress In Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, And Mathematics (Steam)\\\"", "date": "2010-05-01", "cleaned_text": "- THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND A STRATEGIC TREATMENT PLAN BASED ON TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE (TCM) - Nai-Yi (2022).
