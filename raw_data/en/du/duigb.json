The Meditation Muse Collection was born from my deep desire to help you find peace, growth and healing. Meditation is one of the best practices to achieve these things and also, ironically, one of the hardest for people to surrender into. Many people have stories or limiting beliefs about their ability to do it \"right\" or to sit still and quiet the mind for any length of time. Others enjoy the practice and want to go deeper and have more profound experiences. So I created a collection that not only relaxes your body and mind, it also will help you achieve a more meaningful and enlightening practice. "}
