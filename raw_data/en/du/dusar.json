Through a range of initiatives made possible by an energetic and knowledgeable staff, he established ODS as a strong and authoritative voice for rigorous science in dietary supplements and related areas of nutrition. ODS continues to address many of the issues in dietary supplements, from evaluation of the literature to supporting and conducting science, and translating the results of that work into reliable and effective information for the public. Dr . Coates was Acting Director of the NIH Office of Disease Prevention (ODP) from 2010- 2012. Dr. Coates also served from 1996- 1999 as Deputy Director of the Division of Nutrition Research Coordination (DNRC) at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). In that role, Dr. Coates helped to coordinate human nutrition research efforts, both at the NIH and between the NIH and other government agencies. Dr. Coates was Co -Chair of the joint DHHS/USDA Steering Committee overseeing plans for the National Nutrition Summit that was held in Washington in 2000. He was a member of the Federal Steering Committee that oversees the development of the Dietary Reference Intakes. He was Co -Executive Secretary of the Interagency Committee on Human Nutrition Research and Chair of the Federal Working Group on Dietary Supplements. In 2011, he received the Conrad A. Elvehjem Award from the American Society for Nutrition (ASN) for public service in nutrition. In 2013, he became a Fellow of the ASN and currently serves on the ASN Board of Directors. He was lead editor of the Encyclopedia of Dietary Supplements and associate editor of The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition . B efore joining the DNRC, Dr. Coates was NIDDK's Program Director for the Type 2 Diabetes Research Program (1993 -1996) and Project Officer for the multi -center clinical study, Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (1994 -1996). From 1994 until his d eparture from NIDDK, he maintained an active role in career development and fellowship training in the Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Metabolic Diseases. P rior to his career at NIH, he was on the faculty of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. He did postdoctoral training in the Department of Human Genetics and Biometry at University College London, after receivin g his Ph.D. in human genetics fr om Queen's University in Canada. A BSTRACT T here is no global consensus on how dietary supplements (DS)/natural products/ complementary medicines/food supplements should be defined. Even in countries with similar cultures, legal systems, and levels of economic development, regulations applying to these products vary considerably. A further challenge is that DS products can evoke emotive and polarizing viewpoints. The prevalence o f DS use has increased dramatically in the last few decades, as has the application of state -of-the-art scientific methods to explore their ingredients. Progress on the evaluation of botanical and other non- nutrient DS ingredients has been considerable, a nd yet challenges still exist. Fortunately, a number of research resources have been made available to advance this work, notably from the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) and its collaborators in government, academia, and the DS industry. T he OD S Analytical Methods and Reference Materials Program accelerates creation and dissemination of much- needed tools to enhance the reliability and reproducibility of research using DS products. The Dietary Supplement Label Database now contains full label in formation for over 75,000 products, including historical information on those no longer in the marketplace; this is useful in monitoring trends in DS use in the population, and the contribution that DS make to the total intake of important nutrients. The P opulation Studies Program provides tools for integrating the nutrient intakes from foods and DS, as well as evaluating patterns of DS use in large surveys such as NHANES. Probably the most important resource offered by ODS is its Communications Program, w hich translates research findings into useful information for the public and other stakeholders. This includes online fact sheets about numerous nutrient and non-nutrient DS ingredients. ODS also offers an annual 3 -day intensive course on issues in DS research. D etails of these and other ODS initiatives are available at www.ods.od.nih.gov . Paula_Brown@bcit.ca Safety of Botanical Dietary Supplements P aula N.

Dr. Brown is the Dietary Supplement & Traditional Medicine Section Editor for Journal of the AOAC International and holds the Canada Research Chair in Phytoanalytics. ABSTRACT Product quality and authenticity has been a concern at the forefront of the natural products industry after s ignificant media attention has continually presented negative articles in this regard. Unfortunately, many botanical products in the market today differ substantially in form, potency and even route of administration from the traditional herbal medicines from which they were derived. With a multitude of ingredient combinations seen in products that not only incorporate previously unseen herbal ingredient combinations, but the addition of technical ingredients such as flavourings and emulsifiers it is difficult to justify the relationship between history of safe use and modern safety for these products. The measurands selected to represent quality determinants, in particular for identity, must too evolve to ensure they are fit for their intended purpose. U nivariate measurements of phytochemicals in an analytical method validation framework already exist; however combining such quantitative measurements with an identity parameter is highly desirable but challenging to do. Very limited literature exists in p roviding guidance in the authentication of botanical -based products in a practical sense. The challenges presented by a continuously changing botanical product landscape will be discussed along recent approaches employed to interpret plant secondary metabolite data sets for authentication and improved safety. mary.paine@wsu.edu Natural Product- Drug Interaction Research: Cultivating Best Practices Mary Paine , PhD College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Washington State University, Spokane, WA , USA BIOGRAPHY D r. Mary Paine is a professor in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Washington State University. She received her BS in pharmacy at Oregon State University, her PhD in pharmaceutics at the Universityof Washington, and completed a post -doctoral fellowship in clinical pharmacology at the University of Michigan. Her longstanding research program, funded continuously by the National Institutes of Health, focuses on adverse interactions between conventional medications and natural products. D r. Paine leads the Center of Excellence for Natural Product -Drug Interaction Research, a multidisciplinary effort involving clinical pharmacologists, natural products chemists, and health informaticists to provide leadership in the study of these complex interactions. She has coauthored more than 95 publications as original research articles, reviews, editorials, and book chapters. She is currently an associate editor for the journals Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutic s and Drug Metabolism and Disposition. A BSTRACT H umans have consumed botanical dietary supplements and other natural products (NPs) for medicinal purpose since antiquity. Nowadays, the marketing and use of NPs for health and wellness benefits thrive worldwide, with global sales projected to exceed $200 billion within the next few years. In parallel with rising NP sales are increasing concerns about patients supplementing their prescribed pharmacotherapeutic regimens with these perceived safe and effective products, increasing the risk for adverse NP -drug interactions. Common pharmacokinetic mechanisms underlying NP -drug interactions include induction and inhibition of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters by the NP, leading to altered systemic or tiss ue drug concentrations and potentially, suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. Unlike for drug -drug interactions, harmonized guidances for assessing NP -drug interactions do not exist. B ecause NPs are inherently complex chemical mixtures that vary substantively between brands and sometimes batches of the same brand, a multidisciplinary effort involving clinical pharmacologists, NP chemists, and health informaticists is needed for rigorou s assessment and dissemination of the drug interaction liability of NPs. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health established the Center of Excellence for Natural Product Drug Interaction Research (NaPDI Center) in September 2015. A ke y deliverable of the NaPDI Center is a set of recommended approaches to guide researchers in the proper conduct of NP -drug interaction studies. These approaches will be based on results generated from a series of ongoing interaction projects examining four systematically selected NPs as precipitants of pharmacokinetic NP -drug interactions. The aggregate data are being entered into a data repository that will be disseminated to researchers via a public access portal. The efforts of the NaPDI Center should lead to improved design of future NP -drug interaction research and ultimately, evidenced -based information for health care providers and patients about the optimal management of these complex interactions. Botanical Ingredient Adulteration : How Some Suppliers Attempt to Fool Commonly Used Analytical Techniques Stefan Gafner, PhD C hief Science Officer, American Botanical Council Austin, TX, USA Technical Director, ABC -AHP-NCNPR Botanical Adulterants Program, University of Mississippi , Oxford, MS, UA B IOGRAPHY S tefan Gafner received his degree in pharmacy at the School of Pharmacy, University of Berne, in Berne, Switzerland. He obtained a PhD in pharmaceutical sciences, with a focus on the chemistry of medicinal plants, from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, and conducted postdoctoral research on cancer chemopreventive natural products at the University of Illinois - Chicago in the College of Pharmacy's Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy. For over a decade , Dr. Gafner has served as a director of analytical chemistry in the R&D department of natural personal care products company Tom's of Maine. He is currently Chief Science Officer of the American Botanical Council, an independent, nonprofit research and ed ucation organization. He is also technical director of the ABC -AHP - NCNPR Botanical Adulterants Program, a large -scale collaborative program initiated by the American Botanical Council (ABC), the American Herbal Pharmacopoeia (AHP), and the National Center for Natural Product Research (NCNPR) at the University of Mississippi to educate members of the herbal and dietary supplement industry about ingredient and product adulteration. A BSTRACT S USA 2Steven Foster Group, Eureka Springs, AK, USA 3ReevesGroup, Virginia Beach, VA , USA 4NCNPR, University of Mississippi, University MS , USA 5American Herbal Pharmacopoeia, Scotts Valley , CA, USA The chemically complex nature of herbs and botanically -derived ingredients calls for unique quality control processes of herbal products. One of the universal regulatory requirements in industrialized nations around the world is the appropriate testing for identity and authenticity of botanical materials. However, unscrupulous suppliers often take advantage of a lack of specificity in test methods used to confirm the identity of a botanical ingredient by providing materials that may comply with these identity tests even if they do not correspond to the material declared on the label. Example s of such practices are the adulteration of cranberry ( Vaccinium macrocarpo n) extracts other plants, e.g., mulberry or wild cherry ( Prunus avium ) fruits, or th e undeclared addition of natural or synthetic isolates, such as curcumin or extracts, respectively. In order to educate members of the herbal and dietary supplement industry about ingredient and product adulteration , the American Botanical Council (ABC), the American Herbal Pharmacopoeia (AHP), and the National Center for Natural Product Research (NCNPR) at the University of Mississippi have initiated the ABC -AHP -NCNPR Botanical Adu lterants Program. As part of this effort, this presentation will give examples of herbal ingredient adulteration reports published over the past ten years with an emphasis on cases where standard chemical tests may not be adequate to detect the adulterating materials. soumyana@ohsu.edu Regulatory Approvals for Clinical Studies of Botanical Products - Centella a siatica as a Case Study Amala Soum yanath, PhD Associate Professor of Neurology Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon USA BIOGRAPHY Dr. Amala Soumyanath received her Pharmacy degree and PhD from the University of London, UK.

Contributed TalkBotanical products are widely used by the public as diet ary supplements with increasing popularity. However, their evaluation in clinical tria ls commonly requires prior approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an Institutional Review Board (IR B), and the funding orga nization. When a thera peutic outcome is pursued, the botanical is no longer considered a dietary supplement, necessitating approval as an \"Investigationa l New Drug\" (IND) from the FDA. Botanical products present unique challenges due to t heir complexity, variability, and multi- target activity. Thus the FDA has issued special guidelines for the content of FDA IND applications for botanicals, which differ somewhat from the guidelines for single chemical drugs. In addition, the widespread previous human use of bota nical products may reduce the requirement for det ailed toxicity studies. However, differences in product composition due to varying sources and preparation methods may reduce the relevance of safety data obtained from current human use and published toxicity studies if they relate to other types of ext racts of the same botanical. We will describe our process to obtain FDA IND, IRB and funding organizat ion (National Center for Complementary and Integrative Hea lth (NIH/NCCIH)) approvals for our clinical studies on the neurotropic botanical Centella asiat ica. While we have robust preclinical data to support the evaluation of a Centella asiatica water extract (CAW) for cognitive end points in humans, we will describe additional preclinical st udies we have performed on this extract including safety, effects on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, detailed chemical characterization and predefined st ability studies all as a necessary part of our FDA IND a pplication. This presentation will provide an overview of the type of data, information and relative emphases that are required in the applications for FDA IND, IRB and NIH/NCCIH approval of our clinical trial protocols.Botanical Supplements: From Safety to Application Chair: Richard van Breemen , PhD, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University Wednesday August 14, 1:30PM - 5:10PM dnikol1@uic.edu Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Residual Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids Commercial Borage Oil Products Dejan Nikolic, PhD Univ ersity of Illinois Chicago Chicago, IL, USA BIOGR APHY Dejan N ikolic is a Research Associate Professor in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences (formerly Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy) in the College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at Chicago. Dejan received PharmD degree from University of Belgrade and PhD degree in Medicinal Chemistry from the University of Illinois at Chicago working under supervision of Dr. Richard van Breemen . After graduation, he joined the newly established UIC/NIH Center for Botanical Dietary Supplements Rese arch where he is currently a Co -Leader of the Analytical Core that provides mass spectrometric support to the Center.

He has authored and co - authored more than 100 publications and two book chapters. ABST RACT Dejan Nikolic1, Richard van Breemen2 University of Illinois, Chicago, IL , USA Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State USA Borage ( Borago officinalis ) is an annual herb cultivated for production of its seed oil. Borage oil is rich in -linolenic acid, which is actively being investigated for its beneficial effects on cardiovascular health and other conditions. However, borage seeds are known to contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). Some members of this group of alkaloids are known hepatotoxins and some may be genotoxic and carcinogenic. As these compounds do not have known beneficial effects and because the long -term effects of low -level exposure are not well understood, the pres ence of PAs in dietary supplements is generally considered undesirable. Therefore, it is of importance to develop methods to identify and quantify residual levels of these compounds. In this study, commercially available borage oil supplements were extracted using diluted acid and concentrated on cation -exchange solid -phase extraction cartridges. Resulting extracts were analyzed on a high -resolution quadrupole/time -of-flight mass spectrometer for qualitative and on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer for quantitative analysis. Residual PAs were detected in all tested preparations, although with large variability in content ranging from 0.19 -4240 ng/g oil. This suggests that PAs despite being relatively polar compounds do transfer into the oil during the supplement processing. The phytochemistry of borage PAs is much more complex than previously thought. The main characteristic of the alkaloid metabolome is presence of an unusual class of glycosidated PAs. In addition to the known compounds containing a single hexose (thesinine glucoside), we identified several novel analogs containing di - and tri saccharide units as well as compounds containing new structural templates. Even though the amount of measured residual hepatotoxic alkaloids was generally low, we recommend that quality control procedures be implemented to ensure that the final products do not contain these compounds. nadja_cech@uncg.edu Untargeted Metabolomics for Authentication o f Botanical Dietary Supplements Nadja B .

ABSTRACT Dietary supplements, which include botanical (plant- based) natural products, constitute a multi - billion -dollar industry in the US. Regulation and quality control for this industry is an ongoing challenge. While there is general agreement that rigorous scie ntific studies are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of botanical natural products used by consumers, researchers conducting such studies face a unique set of challenges. Botanical natural products are inherently complex mixtures, with composition that differs depending on myriad factors including variability in genetics, cultivation conditions, and processing methods. Unfortunately, many studies of botanical natural products are carried out with poorly characterized study material, such that the results are irreproducible and difficult to interpret. To address this challenge, our research group has developed untargeted mass spectrometry metabolomics approaches to compare commercial dietary supplements and determine which are most representative of those used by consumers. An important element of these studies is the calculation of a \"composite score\", which is a quantitative metric that classifies the similarity among samples based on principal component analysis data. Several case studies will be presented illustrating how this approach has been applied to select study materials of green tea ABSTRACT Edward.kennelly@lehman.cuny.edu Black Cohosh: Confusion Regarding the M echanism of A ction of a Botanical Dietary Supplement Edward J.

ABSTRACT On February 11, 2019, Fo od and Drug Commissioner issued a statement on the government's new efforts to strengthen the regulation of dietary supplements. Many medicinal plants are sold in the US as dietary supplements, and are therefore regulated under the 25 -year -old Dietary Supplement Health and Regulation Act. However, numerous problems with the quality assurance of these products have been documented. Rece nt developments in the field of separation science and the application of statistical modeling provide an important foundation for analyzing the complex chemistry of botanicals, and can be useful to address issues of both safety and efficacy. Using modern analytical chemistry techniques like LC -qToF -MS, my laboratory has been able to identify key marker compounds, and correlate certain metabolites with biological activities from a number of different medicinal plants and functional foods. For examp le, products made with black cohosh ( Actaea racemosa) constitute one of the most popular botanical dietary supplements in the US market for women's health, but its bioactive constituents continue to be explored, and concerns about adulteration of this product are well - documented. Using validated analytical methods, we found about a third of black cohosh products in our study were adulterated. We also found that even authentic black cohosh is not estrogenic, as is often claimed. Problems with the quality control of botanical dietary supplements sold in the United States are not unique to black cohosh. fred.stevens@oregonstate.edu Polyphenols from H ops ( Humulus lupulus ) for Mitigating Metabolic Syndrome and Inflammatory Bowel Disease J an F.

Di etary polyphenols exert a broad spectrum of beneficial effects in various models of disease. Despite many investigations, no clear mechanism of action has emerged to explain their beneficial health effects. We explore the use of untargeted, mass spectrom etry-based metabolomics and lipidomics approaches to elucidate mechanisms of polyphenol bioactivity in vivo; in particular, the from hops ( Humulus lupulus ) on in rodent models of metabolic syndrome (MetS). XN h as received increasing attention in recent years due to its reported anti -obesity, anti -inflammatory, anti -hyperglycemic and anti -hyperlipidemic activities in animal models of MetS. As gut microbiota mediate the physiological impacts of dietary polypheno ls, we also study the interaction between gut microbiota and XN. Gut microbial metabolism of XN yields the estrogenic metabolite, 8 -prenylnaringenin, which is a potential health concern in the development of XN as a dietary supplement for prevention or tre atment of MetS. We approached this concern by reducing the double bond of XN's , -unsaturated keto and tetrahydroxanthohumol (TXN), which cannot be metabolically converted into 8 -prenylnaringenin. Data from cell culture and rodent models of MetS indicate that the hydrogenated XN derivatives, DXN and TXN, have potential to prevent or treat the metabolic impairments associated with diet- induced obesity and MetS without risk of estrogenic adverse effects. In view of the role of gut dysbiosis in the development and progression of inflammatory bowel disease and our observation that XN alters the gut microbiome and reduces the formation of pro -inflammatory cytokine levels in our MetS model, we are beginning to investigate the effects of XN on gut inflammation in humans. We are conducting two prospective clinical trials with XN (24 mg q.d.): one with 24 healthy adults and one with 24 adults diagnosed with Crohn's Disease (Funding by NCCIH grants R01 AT009168 ABSTRACT HO Metabolic Syndrome Elizabeth F loyd, PhD Penningt on Biomedical Research Center Baton Rouge, LA, USA BIOGRAPHY Elizabeth (Beth) Floyd received her PhD in Biochemistry in 1997 and joined the faculty at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in 2004 after completing postdoctoral fellowships at Washington University in St. Louis and Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.

ABSTRACT Biomedical Research Center, Baton Rouge, LA, USA 2University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA 3Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA First described over ninety yea rs ago, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the United States reached 35% by 2012. Fueled by the obesity epidemic, the syndrome is a collection of risk factors related to obesity-i nduced insulin resistance that places an individual with obesity at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There is a long history of therapeutic use of plant extracts to treat symptoms related to metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. This includes Metformin, a mainstay of met abolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes treatment, which is based on a guanidine from Galega officina lis (French lilac). Elizabeth.Floyd@pbrc.edu Artemisia species are also widely used in traditional medicine and our preclinical studies show that an ethanolic extract of Artemisia dracunculus (Russian ta rragon), termed PMI-5 011, has therapeutic potential i n treating metabolic syndrome. Using animal models of obesity-i nduced insulin re sistance, we found tha t PMI-5 011 mitigates obesity-i nduced insulin resistance and improves glucose metabolism by enhancing insulin signaling in skeletal muscle. Reduced skeletal muscle protein de gradation is an important benefit of PMI-5 011-m ediated enhanced insulin signaling that may translate into preservat ion of muscle mass i n obesity. Five phytochemicals were identified in PM I-5011 that affect glucose metabolism and insulin responsiveness. Among them, for the hypoglycemia effects of PMI-5 011. These studies a lso show that DMC-2 is sufficient to stimulate insulin signaling in skeletal muscle and studies in vivo indica te skeletal muscle is the primary target of DMC-2 and PMI-5 011 activity. In a recent clinical study, we found that PMI-5 011 is safe and well-t olerated. Moreover, DMC-2 is bioavailable within six hours of oral administration in humans, providing support for future st udies to determine the efficacy of t he Russian tarragon extract in preventing obesity-i nduce metabolic syndrome by enha i nsulin action in skeletal muscle. tkensler@fredhutch.org Enhanced Detoxication of Air Pollutants with Broccoli -based Interventions Thoma s Kensler, PhD Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health BIOGRA PHY Thomas K ensler received his Ph.D. in toxicology from M.I.T. Following postdoctoral fellowships at the McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin and at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, MD, he joined the faculty of the Johns Hopkins Bloombe rg School of Public Health, Baltimore MD in 1980. In 1992 he was promoted to the rank of Professor. In 2010 he moved his primary appointment to the University of Pittsburgh as Professor in the Department of Pharmacology & Chemical Biology and in 2018 to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. He also holds several Visiting Professorships in China. Dr. Kensler's research interests are in environmental carcinogenesis and cancer prevention. His work demonstrates that activation of KEAP1 -NRF2 -signaling pathway is a key adaptive response to environmental and endogenous stresses and can be effectively targeted by thiol -reactive small molecules. He has led several clinical trials of inducers of the Nrf2 pathway in the Qidong region of China. Recent trials have focused on interventions with broccoli sprout -derived beverages (rich in sulforaphane) as modulators of aflatoxin and air pollutant metabolism and DNA damage. Dr. Kensler is a past chairman of the NIH Chemo/Dietary Study Section and is currently a Senior Editor for Cancer Prevention Research. He has received several honors including the 2007 AACR - American Cancer Society Award for Research Excellence in Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention, the 2009 Society of Toxicology Translational Impact Award and the 2011 Friendship Award from the, People's Republic of China, their highest award for foreign civilians.

ABSTRACT Thomas Kensler1, Jian -Guo Chen2, Patricia Egner3, Derek Ng3, John Groopman Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA , USA 2Qidong Liver Cancer Institute, Qidong, Jiangsu, China 3Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA Airbo rne pollutants have collectively been classified as a known human carcinogen and, more broadly, affect the health of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Benzene is a frequent component of air pollution and strategies to protect individuals against unavoidable exposure to this and other airborne carcinogens could improve the public's health. China is one of the world's largest emitters of anthropogenic air pollution and levels of outdoor air pollution in China are among the highest in the world. Ou r prior studies in Qidong, an area of rapidly growing economic development in the Yangtze River Basin, measured high levels of certain internal dose biomarkers of air pollutants including benzene, aldehydes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We have evaluated the strategy of inducing detoxication of air pollutants through activation of NRF2 s ignaling using a broccoli sprout beverage containing sulforaphane and its biogenic precursor glucoraphanin. Several key challenges in the design of clinical chemoprevention trials, especially food -based trials, are the selection of the dose, formulation, and dose schedule of the intervention material. We have recently completed a randomized, placebo -controlled, multi -dose trial of broccoli sprout beverage to determine the lowest effective level that enhances benzene detoxication adjudged by enhanced excret ion of mercapturic acid of ~25 \u00b5mol sulforaphane metabolites per day significantly increased the rate of urinary excretion of SPMA; lower doses were not effective. Tablet -based formulations provide equivalent internal doses of sulforaphane with decreased inter -individual variability and may portend a practical and frugal population -based strategy to attenuate associated long - term health risks of air pollution.

Long -Term Effects of a Botanical Cardiovascular Support Formula on Blood Pressure in Adults with Prehypertension and Stage 1 Hypertension Jennifer J. R yan, ND, MS National Un iversity of Natural Medicine Helfgott Research Institute Portland, OR, USA BIOGRAPHY Jennifer Ryan is a full-t ime Investigator at National University of Natural Medicine in Portland, OR. Prior to her medical training, Dr. Ryan was a basic scientist at Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute and Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research. Her current projects involve examining the clinical safety, tolerability, and biologic mechanisms of various botanicals, p robiotics, ABSTRACT Jennifer Ryan1, Douglas Hanes1, Ryan Bradley1,2 1National University of Natural Medicine, Portland, OR, USA 2University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA Background: The authors recently reported results of a safety study on a botanical formula in adults with prehypertension and stage 1 hypertension. Primary findings su ggested the formula is safe for long - term use in the studied population. Exploratory findings included significant decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP). A secondary analysis was recently performed to further elucidate effects on BP. Methods: Contributed Talk Participants (n=30) were asked to take one caplet of a botanical formula per day for six months. Outcome measures, including clinical biomarkers, validated questionnaires, and vi tal signs were collected at ba seline, after t hree months, and after six months. For the secondary analysis,participants were categorized as meeting JNC-7 criteria for eithe r prehypertension (PH) or sta ge 1 hypertension (S1H) according to baseline values. BP data were reevaluated according t o subgroup. Results: At baseline, 30.0% of the study populat ion met criteria for S1H. In contrast, only 4.0% and 5.3% met criteria for S1H after 3 months and after 6 months, respectively. Over the 6 month period, mean BP decreases in the e ntire study popula tion were 13.6 mmH g systolic and 9.4 mmHg diastolic (p<.0001). However, subgroup analysis indicated that BP decreases were higher in participants with S1H. Systolic BP decreased 20.8 mmHg and 15.2 mm Hg ( p<.05). Conclusions: The most recent findings suggest the investigated formula had a greater effect on BP in adults wit h S1H than in those wi th PH, further providing justification for additional research on the formula. Future studies should expand the st udy population to include adults with stage 2 hypertension, in order to further explore magnitude of effects on BP. Forthcoming work should also examine escalat ion of the dose of the formula , as well as biologic mechanisms of action, which may include potassium- sparing and diuresis effects, as well as "}
