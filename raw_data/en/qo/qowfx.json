As dietary science grows ever more complex, and our understanding of the age-old maxim 'you are what you eat' becomes ever more appreciated and understood, we have recently been wondering how the foods we consume affect our personal \"natural\" scent. We've all experienced, for example, how eating a little too much garlic can leave a unique (and not entirely pleasant) aroma on both our breath and our skin... but are there other examples of how natural ingredients can impact our natural skin scent in good or bad ways? As our recent gourmand additions to the Maison21G Paris essence collection proves, food and flavours can provide endless inspiration and joy when it comes to perfume. However, when it comes to our signature scent, the perfume is only ever half of the story. The rest comes down to how a scent interacts with the skin, with your own personal and unique fragrance. Maximising the pleasant aspects of your body odour will magnify the beauty of your perfume, and vice versa. As such, it's important to remember that we really are what we eat... and that includes the way we smell! It should come as no real surprise to discover that there is a deep and intrinsic link between diet and your bodily odour, and finding out a little more about which foods most notably affect this link can help us regulate our odour, boosting our confidence and leaving us smelling more attractive. After all, you might have impeccable standards of personal hygiene, and take great care to bathe daily and apply your usual array of beloved products, perfumes, and other items to keep yourself feeling clean and smelling sweet. However, if there are stubborn odours which seem to stick to your skin, and you aren't sure of the cause, it's likely to be the foods you are eating that are to blame. Let's take a closer look at what causes this effect, and which foods should be welcomed in our diet, and which should be enjoyed sparingly. IMPORTANT TIPS FOR YOUR LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP LIFE: WHICH FOOD MIGHT NEGATIVELY IMPACT YOUR PERSONAL INTIMATE ODOUR? Some foods simply give off more powerful odours than others. The compounds which form the aroma of some foods will make their way into your body's perspiration systems, and make their presence known through your sweat or by your saliva. As with so many things in life, moderation is key with this, too! Fish Despite the well-known health benefits of oily fish and the Omega-3 fatty acids they impart, certain fish, most famously tuna, contain high quantities of choline (Vitamin B4) which can cause a 'fishy' odour to linger on the skin. Red Meat Due to our relatively slow digestion system, red meats take a long time to be processed by the body, leaving them to decompose in the gut and produce unpleasant-smelling gases. Garlic, Onion, and Chillies Certain foods, most notably hot spices and vegetables featuring capsaicin (such as chillies) increase the body temperature and prompt the secretion of sweat. This will, in turn, increase the potency of your body odour. All three of these pungent ingredients produce chemical substances which are eliminated by the body via the lungs and sweat glands, resulting in body odours and bad breath. Asparagus While undeniably delicious, asparagus produces an amino acid (asparagine) while it is being digested, which is highly odorous and can alter the smell of sweat and urine. Cumin and Curry Spices Hot spices, such as those featured in your favourite Indian and Southeast Asian dishes, are very quickly eliminated by the pores of the skin, resulting in a lingering odour that can persist for several days. Furthermore, spicy food in general can promote perspiration, which may lead to excess body odour. Tomatoes Despite having well-known deodorant qualities when applied topically, tomatoes can actually negatively impact the smell of sweat on the skin. This is a result of the high concentration of caretonoids and terpenes present in tomatoes, which are released during digestion. However, dieticians claim that the impact of tomatoes on body odour is only detectable when eaten in very large quantities. BEST SECRETS: THE KEY INGREDIENTS TO EAT TO SMELL NATURALLY GREAT! Here at Maison21G Paris, we frequently encapsulate the beautiful fragrances of many ingredients and foods, seeking out the most striking and enticing notes within them for use in our blended perfumes and individual essences. When it comes to eating and drinking, certain foods and natural ingredients can have a similarly evocative and pleasing effect on the scent of your body and skin, with the below believed to be the most effective. Water There's no denying the fact that we should all be drinking more water and improving our hydration, but if you need a little more convincing, consider this: water helps eliminate the toxins which cause bad odour, leaving the skin feeling and smelling fresher and cleaner. Likewise, drinking natural herbal teas, or infusing your water with a slice of lemon adds to this antioxidant effect, further cleansing the body and promoting pleasant odours. Citrus Fruits Oranges, lemons, and grapefruits are packed full of pleasant-smelling oils and compounds, which quickly become absorbed by the body and gently released through the skin. As such, eating such fruits is a quick way to improve your natural aroma. Aromatic Spices Cinnamon, cardamom, and other aromatic spices not only lend a beautiful fragrance to food and drinks, they also have a similar effect upon the body and breath! Apples Apples are nature's great cleansers. They taste delicious, are bursting with vitamins and other health-giving compounds, and also prevent bad breath. What's not to love? Celery Forget oysters and Champagne; celery is possibly one of the most effective aphrodisiac ingredients... and it's much friendlier on the wallet, too. The reason for this is that celery contains chemicals which help boost the body's natural pheromone production, making you smell more attractive to the opposite sex. There you have it - the Maison21G Paris guide to using food, drinks, and a healthy, balanced diet for promoting pleasant bodily aroma, and avoiding bad smells and "}
