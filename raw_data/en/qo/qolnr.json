One aspect is cooperation with our fellow WSC members, another is collaboration with other standards developers, and yet a third is active outreach to new technology and areas of social concern so that ISO provides maximum value to all its stakeholders - and is perceived as providing that value - in whatever silo that stakeholder resides.Comment The workshop on standardiza-tion for medical technologies, reported on p. 7, is the pre- miere event of the World Standards Cooperation (WSC), consisting of the three international standards organi-zations, IEC, ITU-T and ISO. The participation of the many important actors in producing, standardizing, regulating, and using this technology is most gratifying ; their commitment to the goal of One Standard - One Test - One Acceptance Globally is very welcome. The ongoing series of WSC workshops focuses on issues or activities impacting the standards programmes of our three organizations and our stakeholders. Reading reports of this workshop, however, reminded me of an inevitable facet of our cur-rent global stage of development : silos - tall windowless cylinders. Each of us leverage our effectiveness by working in a few silos where we can develop and deploy expertise and influence. Conversely, these many silos can slow the diffusion of learning or the accumulation of energy needed to seize major challenges. WSC is a good example of three fundamentally aligned organizations that serve differ-ent users. We have, in the past, been quite distinct, but by working outside each of our silos with the others, we learn from each other, we communi-cate more coherently and powerfully to our various stakeholders, and we each better accomplish our individual missions. Sometimes, as when a medical technology involves all three organiza-tions, we will contribute by establish-ing a single coordinated technical programme. At other times, we will contribute by working with other stan-dards developers to provide the value of the IEC, ITU-T or ISO processes. Many times we may contribute most Greater gains for stakeholders through unity by bringing together the many actors involved to make sure contacts are made, misimpressions cleared up, and common goals established. In other words, WSC can help to put windows in the various silos. Perhaps we can even initiate continuous communica-tion. \" WSC is a good example of three fundamentally aligned organizations that serve different users.\" Oliver Smoot ISO PresidentIn this regard, we need the participation of all parties involved. Even if the technology all lies within one of either IEC, ITU-T or ISO, there are other silos. Business, consumers, academia, conformity assessors, regu-lators, labour, developed countries, developing countries, these are silos, too. Most often we focus on the \" how \" of standardizing; making the technical committees more efficient. This workshop addressed the \" why \" of voluntary consensus international standardization. In general, what do IEC, ITU-T, and ISO offer to the world at large ? Why should medical technol-ogy regulators know of the value of an IEC Electromagnetic Compatibility standard, unless they understand something of how we operate and what value we can offer in resolving their needs ? We have a good story to tell about the credibility of our processes, WSC is one vehicle for the three orga-nizations to tell that story better. This need to articulate the value of International Standards, indeed of ISO itself, more broadly and vigorously was well-supported by ISO Council in our March meeting focused on the proposed Horizon 2010 plan. The proposal to come to the General ISO Focus May 2004 1World Scene International crash test dummy makes official debut The much-anticipated presenta- tion of the first international crash test dummy will make its official debut on 22 June in Geneva, Switzerland. The dummy, known as World- SID (for World Side Impact Dummy), has been under devel-opment since 1997 and repre-sents a major breakthrough in worldwide harmonization of side impact occupant protection. Its 212 sensors capture data more than 1000 times per sec-ond and store the information in special memory boards inside the dummy, making it the most advanced (and probably the smartest) crash test dummy in the world.Georg Hongler, CEN Secretary-General dies The European Committee for Standardization (CEN) announces the death, following a serious illness, of its Secre-tary-General, Georg Hongler, aged 60, in Brussels on 13 April 2004. Originally from Switzerland, Georg Hongler was appointed the Secretary-General of CEN in 1997 and was responsible for the daily management of the organization, including the staff of the CEN Management Centre in Brussels. Mr. Hon-gler was the driving force in the development of the new CEN strategy 2010 and was strongly committed to the resulting reorganization of the CEN governance structures. During his seven years in office, Mr. Hongler was dedi-cated to a close and productive cooperation between CEN and its sister European Standards Organizations - CENELEC and ETSI - and was also in regular contact with ISO. To all those within the ISO community who came in con-tact with him, he leaves the image of a profoundly dedicat-ed and humane person, actively promoting the collaboration between CEN and ISO and contributing to making the Vienna Agreement the recog-nized success it is today. Harmonizing international food standards The joint Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) Codex Alimentarius Commis-sion, the body that sets interna-tional food standards, will hold its 27th session in Geneva, Switzerland on 28 June to 3 July 2004.ISO strengthens cooperation with international accreditors A Memorandum of Under- standing (MoU) was signed by the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC), and ISO in an ongoing effort to improve their technical cooperation. The MoU, signed in March 2004, will consolidate practic-es that are largely already implemented by the three organizations, and will enable ISO to better manage and mon-itor the relationships of its var-ious components with the international accreditation community. Accreditation, based in particu- lar on the collaboration and agreements within IAF and ILAC and their memberships, has become an important and recognized option for the eval-uation and recognition of oper-ators involved in testing, cali-bration and inspection as well as in assessing the conformity of products, services, manage-ment systems and personal competence based on ISO/IEC Standards and Guides. The Codex Alimentarius Com-mission was created by FAO and WHO to develop food standards, guidelines and relat-ed texts such as codes of prac-tice under the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme. The main purposes of this Pro-gramme are protecting health of the consumers and ensuring fair trade practices in the food trade, and promoting coordina-tion of all food standards work undertaken by international governmental and non-govern-mental organizations, including ISO. ISO technical committee ISO/ TC 34, Food products , has developed almost 600 Interna-tional Standards - with meth-ods of analysis and sampling of particular interest to Codex - and is currently preparing a new International Standard for the design and implementation of an effective food safety management system based on ISO 9001:2000. In view of the Commission's 27th session, ISO intends to give an update of its work which may be of mutual inter-est, including the contribution made by ISO/TC 34 and the ISO Committee on conformity assessment (ISO/CASCO), with the intention of starting up a closer dialogue in the future. For more information : www.codexalimentarius.netThe MoU's main implementa- tion methods will include involvement in each others' technical work, the formation of a high-level joint working group to consider policy and operational issues within accreditation as they arise, and the confirmation of complaint exchange procedures to ensure action is undertaken by one or more of the relevant organiza-tions. The WorldSID development was initiated by an ISO working group on anthropomorphic test devices, with a view to harmo-nizing all existing adult side impact dummies used in differ-ent areas of the world. An ISO WorldSID Task Group coordinates the development of the dummy. It consists of experts from industry and governments representing three regional WorldSID advisory groups - the Americas, Asia/Pacific and Europe - which will unveil the crash test dummy. Presentations will be given by representatives of ISO technical committee ISO/TC 22, Road vehicles , to experts from the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29). Coverage of the event will appear in the July/August issue of ISO Focus . 2 ISO Focus May 2004ISO Scene Dr. Alison Plummer, Director of SLBS, speaking at the seminar in Saint Lucia.

The workshop in April was hosted by the ISO member for Egypt, the Egyptian Organiza-tion for Standardization and Quality Control (EOS), with the support of the Swedish Interna-tional Development Cooperation Agency. A training session was held the next day on the theme, \" Making an impact : consumer the Arab Industrial Development and Mining Organization. ISO Secretary-General Alan Bryden told participants that ISO gives particular importance to the way consumer interests are considered and to increasing the participation of developing countries in the organization's work. Dr. Mahmoud Eisa, Presi-dent of EOS, and Chairman of the Egyptian COPOLCO, announced the support of EOS to other countries in establishing COPOLCO \" mirror commit-tees \", and for a regional COPOLCO. Quality infrastructure in Palestine The importance of the quality infrastructure in developing the Palestinian economy was the subject of a speech given by Pal-estinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei at the opening of a confer-ence held in Ramallah, Palestine in March. Some 250 people attended the Quality Infrastructure Confer-ence which brought together government leaders, quality and business management experts, the Palestinian industry and pri-vate sector institution leaders. The event addressed how to evaluate strategies for building a national quality infrastructure designed to promote the compet-itiveness of Palestinian manufac-turers while protecting citizens and the environment. In cooperation with ISO, the three-day conference was held under the auspices of the Pales-tine Standards Institution (PSI), ISO member for Palestine, and its Chairman of the Board of Directors and Minister of National Economy, H.E. Maher Masri.

It consists of a three-column struc-ture (English/French/German), including an alphabetical index in each of the three languages as well as Spanish. Humorous illustrations give the dictionary a user-friendly touch. The dictionary will assist con- sumers in making an informed choice of tourism services, thereby increasing the likelihood of expectations being met, and of satisfactions being enhanced - while the tourism industry will also benefit from more informed consumers. The dictionary is also intended to be of value to those developing tourism and travel standards. For more information contact : Dr. Holger M\u00fchlbauer at holger.muehlbauer@din.de Benefits of ISO 9000 in hotel and tourism services The benefits of implementing ISO 9000 in the tourism industry was the subject of discussions at seminars in Saint Lucia and Barbados. The seminars, organized in collaboration with the ISO Pro-gramme for Developing Coun-tries, focussed on how ISO 9001:2000 could be a direct way to achieve and add value to the tourism industry and hotel establishments in particular. Some 40 participants attended the seminar in Saint Lucia in March, including four from neighbouring Dominica and Trinidad and Tobago. Hosted by the Saint Lucia Bureau of Stand-ards (SLBS), ISO member for Saint Lucia, the seminar was opened by Maria Flowel, Perma-nent Secretary of the Ministry of Tourism, and Dr. Alison Plum-mer, Director of SLBS. The seminar in Barbados, held also in March, was hosted by the Barbados National Standards Institution (BNSI), ISO member for Barbados, and was opened by its Director, Dudley Rhynd. The Minister of Commerce in Barbados, Lynette Eastmond, expressed her appreciation to ISO for contributing to help members from developing coun-tries to develop their economies through the use of International Standards. representation in standardiza- tion \", with the joint support of COPOLCO and DEVCO, the ISO committees responsible, respectively, for consumer affairs and developing countries. Two hundred people took part in one or both events, including representatives of nine ISO members, Consum- ers International and Participants at both seminars concluded that quality in tourism requires a definition of tourism policy as well as the creation of a network of mutually supporting tourism-related businesses. For this reason, interaction between the national standards bodies --SLBS and BNSI respectively - and tourism authorities in Saint Lucia and Barbados will contrib-ute to improving tourism services in order to obtain and keep a larger share of the upscale tourism market.

Dr. Vladimir Lepakhin, WHO Assistant Director- General for the Health Tech-nology and Pharmaceuticals Group and Dr. Timothy Evans, WHO Assistant Director-General for the Evidence and Information for Policy Group , share their views on the influence of ISO standards and the role of the various actors involved in ensuring the progress, safety and quality of medical technologies. Dr. Vladimir Lepakhin (left) is former Head of the Department of General and Clinical Pharmacology at the Russian University of Peoples' Friendship. For over 20 years he was Director of the USSR and then Russian Drug Authority, and was Deputy Minister of USSR Ministry of Health, responsible for Medical Sciences, Health Technology and Foreign Affairs. He is currently WHO Assistant Director-General, Health Technology and Pharmaceuticals. Dr. Timothy Evans (right) trained in internal medicine at the Brigham and Women's Hospital at Harvard University. He was an assistant professor of international health economics at the Harvard School of Public Health, and most recently served as the Director of Health Equity at the Rockefeller Foundation. He is currently WHO Assistant Director-General, Evidence and Information for Policy. ISO Focus : Some 3 800 health pro- fessionals, experts and support staff work at headquarters in Geneva, in the six regional offices and in coun-tries around the world. How does WHO handle the monitoring of global health issues? Dr. Timothy Evans : In serving our 192 Member States, we rely heavily on our system of networks. Regarding communicable diseases, for instance, there is WHO Global Alert and Response gathering official reports and rumours of suspected outbreaks from a wide range of formal and infor-mal sources. The Global Public Health Intelligence Network, developed for WHO in partnership with Health Canada, is a semi-automated electronic system that continuously searches key Web sites, newswires and online media sites, public health e-mail services, and Web sites of national public health institutions and NGOs to identify early warnin g signals abou t epidemic threats and rumours of unusua l disease e vents. T he system focuses ma inly on communicable diseases but also identifies re lated con di- tions suc h as food and water safety, and chemical events. WHO Collaborating Centre for Internat ional Dru g Monitorin g in Uppsala, Swe - den, with over 60 countries participating in this opera - tional pro ject, helps to keep a global database on adverse drug reactions up to date. We are launching the Health Metrics Network to gather credible health information around the world using a shared technical tem-plate with our partners. WHO Mental Health Programme keeps track of the global trends in suicide and in alcohol abuse through its Suicide Database and Global Alcohol Database. These are isolated examples but practically all WHO programmes have their own global networks and partnerships to ensure that the Organization keeps its finger on the pulse of the planet at all times. ISO Focus : WHO is very active in the launching of health communications campaigns. What kind of impact do such campaigns have on the public ? Dr. Timothy Evans : I will address our main event - World Health Day observed annually on 7 April - but special events linked to its main theme will continue in WHO Member States for the next twelve months. This year it is \" Road Safety is no accident \". Road crashes take the lives of 1,2 mil-lion men, women and children around the world each year. Up to 50 million more are injured on our roads, some of whom become permanently disabled. Copyright WHO 4 ISO Focus May 2004The global event took place in Paris and was co-hosted by WHO and the Government of France. As for the impact such campaigns have on the public, let me quote the French del-egate at the WHO Executive Board: \" The road safety efforts we have conducted during the last 18 months are the most cost-effective public health measures ever undertaken in our country \". ISO Focus : The World Standards Cooperation, the coordination entity between IEC, ISO and ITU-T high-level workshop on International Standards for Medical Technologies, which was held under the patronage of WHO, reinforced the importance of harmonizing the standards needed by this sector in order to enhance public health and foster trade. How would you describe the strategic role of this partnership ? Dr. Vladimir Lepakhin : A core func- tion of WHO, set out in its Constitution is to \" develop, establish and promote international standards with respect to food, biological, pharmaceutical and similar products \", as well as \" to stand- ardize diagnostic procedures as neces-sary \". Beyond that official mandate, WHO Member States have endorsed a much broader scope of activities to cover all aspects of health systems' development and strengthening, for which various standardization and har-monization efforts are required. In the area of pharmaceuticals, WHO produces a broad range of instru-ments for use by regulatory authorities and manufacturers, particularly in developing countries. These include guidelines on: production of drugs and inspection; product assessment and registration, especially for generic drugs and herbal medicines ; distribu- tion; basic tests for quality control ; trade issues from WHO Certification scheme on the quality of pharmaceu-tical products moving in international commerce to import procedures and counterfeit drugs. In biologicals, WHO devel- ops recommendations and guidelines on production and quality control, design and performance specifica-tions. It also establishes International PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, Direction de la Communication \" I consider our collaboration with ISO on safer injection technologies a great success story.\"In practice, WHO standards, guidelines and recommendations serve as advice to Member States. They can, however, be adopted as legally bind-ing national regulations if a national authority so desires. It is important to note that WHO standards are first and foremost concerned with safeguard-ing public health and not with trade. Nevertheless, conformity with quality and safety standards helps exporters to place their products on international markets in a manner that will sup-port the objectives of WHO Member States. Since its founding in 1948, the World Health Organization has pursued the objective of the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health. Crucial to the achievement of this objective is the development of guidelines and standards for the whole range of health work. Quality control for vaccines, medicines and diagnostics, for environmental health, nutri-tion and the components of health systems are examples. WHO's ability to convene all interested parties has been a particular strength in ensuring the acceptability of this work. I am pleased to make this work known to readers of ISO Focus . Dr Lee Jong-Wook, Director-General of the World Health OrganizationCopyright WHO/Pierre Virot ISO Focus May 2004 5ISO Focus : WHO and ISO collaborate on International Standards for safer injection technologies. To what extent is WHO interested in promoting other initiatives, such as ISO standards for condoms, working conditions in clean-rooms or terminology for nurses ? Dr. Vladimir Lepakhin : I consid- er our collaboration with ISO on safer injection technologies a great success story. The same holds true for mechan-ical contraceptives. However, I would like to focus on quality of care and patient safety, areas where we can make a differ-ence. Here is my reasoning. Health care interventions are intended to ben-efit patients, but they can also cause harm. For instance, the Institute of Medicine report estimated that \"medi-cal errors\" cause between 44 000 and 98 000 deaths annually in hospitals in the USA - more than car accidents, breast cancer or AIDS. The Hospitals for Europe's Working Party on Quality Care in Hospitals estimated in 2000 that every tenth patient in hospitals in Europe suffers from preventable harm and adverse effects related to his or her care. WHO is developing global standards and guidelines for quality of care and patient safety. It promotes evidence-based policies, including global standards that will improve Guest View Biological Standards and Reference Materials. The standards established by WHO form the basis for assessing the acceptability of vaccines for pur-chase by international agencies such as UNICEF. Standards in chemical safety are also developed. Extensive data are evaluated for the assessment of risks to man and the environment, and this pro-vides the scientific basis for interna-tional (Codex) and national standards. Also included are pesticide standards, specifications for which are drawn up in the context of the International Code of Conduct on Distribution and Use of Pesticides. Other standard setting areas include guidance on technical speci-fications for radiological systems and recommendations on non-ionizing radi-ation. WHO and FAO together develop regulations for the use of ionizing radi-ation in the irradiation of food. Other, softer, areas of standard- ization are also relevant. In order to make data collected supportive of a patient-centered approach, it is neces-sary to structure it around the needs of the individual. This means ensur-ing full compatibility with internation-ally accepted standards, such as inter-national classifications and nomen-clatures. Not only do these standards help us gain a better overall view of the health situations to inform decision-makers globally, but they also provide a strong base for reporting on the most cost-effective interventions, thus allow-ing a better allocation of resources. Trade in health-related products constitutes about 3 % of world trade in general products which translated into USD 145 billion in 2001. Industrial-ized countries account for about 75 % of trade in these products, with phar-maceuticals and drugs leading the way with the biggest trade volume. It is clear that in health versus trade issues, WHO's primary concern is health but because the biggest part of our con-stituency is developing countries we feel that these countries should have a greater participation and a greater say in formulation of standards.patient care, with particular emphasis on product safety, safe clinical practice and safe use of medicinal products and medical devices. ISO Focus : WHO, by its very mission, and ISO, through its large member-ship, are committed to disseminat-ing progress and good practices in developing countries. Do you see a contribution from international stan-dardization on \" essential \" medical equipment for developing countries and on the improvement of the quality of health services ? Dr. Timothy Evans : In the area of medical devices, WHO wishes to col-laborate with ISO so that international rather than national standards are pro-moted. One of the key elements of the recommendations we make to strength-en National Regulatory Authorities is to pass national regulations based on international standards. These include product standards and quality system standards often referred to as \" best practices \". They integrate many of the principles established by ISO, but make sure that they are in line with the ever-changing realities of the world. In practical terms, however, WHO is looking into ways to use conformity with international standards as a way to pre-qualify medical devices for pro- curement by United Nations' agencies. At WHO we believe that by recommending the use of international standards we stand a good chance of having higher quality medical devices produced worldwide. At the same time, it provides greater opportunity for producers of medical devices in develop-ing countries to bid in United Nations agency tenders, and beyond.

The workshop, which took place in Geneva, Switzerland on 26 and 27 February, was organized by WSC, the coordination entity between IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission), ISO, and ITU-T (Inter-national Telecommunication Union's standardization sector). It was held under the patronage of WHO (World Health Organization) and in partner-ship with four organizations having relevant interests in the medical tech-nologies sector : GHTF (Global Har-monization Task Force), AAMI (Asso-ciation for the Advancement of Medi- cal Instrumentation), Eucomed (Euro-pean Medical Technology Industry Association), and JFMDA (Japan Fed-eration of Medical Devices Associa-tions). In the opening address, Mr. Houlin Zhao, Director of ITU-T, wel- comed participants and commented on the importance of having a workshop at a time when the medical communi-ty becomes increasingly reliant on new and converging technologies. Mr. Zhao pointed out the importance of interna-tional standardization for the evolving world market that will lead to a har-monized system capable of supporting worldwide free trade in optimal and equitable terms. He said, \" For this rea-son, the three organizations are com-mitted to promoting and harmonizing the international standardization sys-tem, strengthening cooperation among themselves and with all partners con-cerned. WSC is an initiative that aims to strengthen, and promote the vol-untary consensus-based Internation-al Standards system of ISO, IEC and ITU.\" Main F ocusCopyright BP Plc. Mr. Sei-ichi Takayanagi, Pres- ident of IEC said, \" Individually and as a group, IEC, ISO and ITU respond to market needs and to society's needs by providing the basic standards. The WHO responds to an essential human need in finding ways to bring health to the people of the world... I believe this [workshop] is a very important and good thing to do not just because of the topic but also because it increases collaboration among the four organiza-tions.\" On a personal note, Mr. Takay-anagi noted the importance of stand-ards for Toshiba, the company he works for : \" As everyone knows, much of any company's bottom line depends on the quality of its products...[and] I \" International Standards and an effective international system make good business sense to a global and highly regulated industry.\" ISO Focus May 2004 7Main Focus Regulators and standards developers, Standards development practices, New technologies and standards and the Development dimension.

Historically, ISO, IEC and ITU address different sectors of technologies. However, within a glo-bal market, emerging technologies and innovation are going to force the organizations to adjust. The political and economic developments of the past years ask for a close cooperation which will lead to synergies in the committee work. The spirit of WSC shall serve all stakeholders worldwide - industry, the business community, governments and other international organizations, users, including consumers.\" At the workshop sessions, par- ticipants exchanged experiences from their own technical committees, organ-izations and countries in five sessions related to : Vision, Links between Against this background, all agreed that International Standards are more than ever an essential factor to support this progress. International Standards can act as a building block for harmonized regulatory processes to assure safe-ty, quality and performance of medi-cal technologies. International Stand-ards that can be used/implemented as broadly as possible by all affected industries, regulators and stakeholders in countries around the world are not only essential in facilitating the dis-semination of medical technologies, but contribute to reducing technical barriers to trade. Their role in improv-ing efficiency of production and facil-itating international trade are recog-nized in the World Trade Organiza-tion's Agreement on Technical Barri-ers to Trade (WTO TBT). According to Michael Miller , President of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumen-tation (AAMI), International Stand-ards and an effective international system make good business sense to Major players involved in the field of medical technologies thrash out core issues of standards development at a panel discussion. 8 ISO Focus May 2004 Teaming up for better health a global and highly regulated indus- try. \" To date, ISO, IEC, ITU-T have created the infrastructure and sys-tem necessary for the development of needed standards and have achieved important goals, such as patient safe-ty and harmonization.\" Some workshop speakers point- ed out, however, that the challenge is not in deciding whether or not Interna-tional Standards are useful - particu-larly when public health and safety are at stake - but rather what can be done to prevent the duplication of work and the plethora of different standards for medical technologies practised by dif-ferent countries around the world. ensure the best possible participation of enterprises and other market forc-es is critical to their successful use by industry. According to Prof. Erich R. Reinhardt, Head of Siemens Medi- cal Solutions, the present challenge is to improve quality care with reduced costs through innovation and workflow optimization. \" Healthcare is a global business... it will only work by orches-trating the cooperation between users, legislators, academia and industry.\" Some of the additional recom- mendations put forward by speakers included : developing more horizon-tal, performance-based standards (as opposed to design prescriptive); sim-plifying and speeding up the stand-ards development process; and reusing existing standards with fewer commit-tees. In addition, increasing transpar-ency and mutual feedback among the parties concerned, as well as increas-ing collaboration with other standards developing organizations (SDO's), industry associations and stakeholders can help to get closer to the specific needs of the global market. - safeguards the health and safety of patients, users and other persons by ensuring that manufacturers of medi-cal technologies follow specified pro-cedures during design, manufacture and marketing. However - and herein lies the challenge - the medical technologies sector is highly regulated and charac-terized by too many rules which may represent unnecessary impediments to trade. There is no magical solution. Speakers noted, however, unless regulatory authorities make better use of identical, or equivalent, Internation-al Standards, then the costly problem of satisfying technical requirements pecu-liar to countries or regions will continue to persist. If it is possible to get agree-ment among the regulators to reference International Standards in regulation, then we will indeed be in a position to achieve the ' one standard, one conform-ity assessment, one test ' dream. Brekelmans, Chairman of GHTF (the Global Harmonization Task Force for Medical Devices). While acknowledging the val- ue of International Standards and the need for cooperation, many workshop speakers confirmed that efforts to bet-ter understand market needs - among them the need for timely, globally rele-vant, market-driven standards - and to Achieving a conducive climate for a regulated industry In addressing the links between regulators and standards developers, workshop speakers confirmed that the regulation of medical technologies - although a challenging undertaking When raising this issue, Dr. Vladimir Lepakhin, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Technol-ogy and Pharmaceuticals, noted that coordination and collaboration with other standards-setting organizations is of the utmost importance for the global harmonization of medical technologies and for the reduction of technical bar-riers to trade. This move, with cooper-ation taking the place of competition, is already being witnessed in the work of WHO and ISO, IEC and ITU-T in a number of areas. In addition to the need for increased cooperation, regulatory authorities and industry should encour-age and support the development of International Standards for medical devices to demonstrate compliance with (GHTF) Essential Principles. \" Authorities developing new medi-cal device regulations should encour-age the voluntary use of International Standards. Wherever possible, the use of national standards should be dis-couraged, as indeed widespread adop-tion of International Standards dis-courages the establishment of unnec-essary trade barriers,\" noted Cornelis \" Healthcare is a global business... it will only work by orchestrating the cooperation between users, legislators, academia and industry.\" From left to right : President of IEC Mr. Sei-ichi Takayanagi , Director of ITU-T, Mr. Houlin Zhao Vice-President, Dr. Torsten Bahke and WHO Assistant Director-General, Health Technology and Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Vladimir Lepakhin , at the opening of the WSC high-level workshop. ISO Focus May 2004 9Main Focus Cooperative arrangements with the participation of regulatory author-ities and representatives of industry, however, are already ensuring to pro-vide common and non-overlapping standards for the various technologies - take, for example, the development of ISO 13485:2003, Medical devic- es - Quality management systems - Requirements for regulatory purposes, which involved the close collaboration between GHTF and ISO. \" The widespread adoption of, and conformity assessment to, this standard (ISO 13485) allows regula-tors to have greater confidence in the design and manufacture of medical devices produced outside their juris-diction, facilitates the exchange of regulatory auditing information, and allows a manufacturer to establish a single quality system that complies with the requirements of major mar-kets,\" noted Cornelis Brekelmans. ISO strives to be inclusive Through a discussion of stand- ards development practices, all-round acceptance was met that that a wide range of stakeholders stand to gain from International Standards that rep-resent the broadest possible interna-tional consensus between all interest-ed parties and, moreover, that stand-ards developed in such conditions will be usable anywhere in the world. According to one Chair's expe- rience, for a standard to be truly inter-national and have global relevance, it must take into account the needs of all stakeholders - without exception. \" To ignore, or fail to take ful- ly into account, the needs of... stake-holders would be to fail the most basic test of standardization - that of ensuring that the standards developed are actually used,\" said Graham Hol- loway, Chair of ISO technical com- mittee ISO/TC 157, Mechanical contraceptives. However, as most speak- ers pointed out, the challenge is not in deciding whether or not the views of stakeholders should or should not be includ-ed, but rather what can be done to ensure an adequate engage-ment of all stakeholders in the standards development proc-ess, including the regulators, the healthcare community as well as other social forces in the field of medical technologies. According to Kevin McKinley, ISO Deputy Secre- tary-General, ISO is striving to be inclusive. \" In an ongoing effort to avoid the duplication of work, ISO is working cooperative-ly and efficiently with organizations that have globally relevant approach-es. In addition, ISO has streamlined its existing procedures and introduced new deliverables for cases where swift development and publication takes priority and encouraged the use of modern project management tech-niques and tools to ensure both the commitment of necessary resources and timely results.\" Matching the speed of innovation In addressing new technolo- gies, speakers recognized that science is progressing much more quickly than the time it takes to develop a standard and any detailed prescriptive standard is not only time-consuming and costly, but may be quickly outdated by new developments and can easily become an obstacle to the provision of state-of-the-art products to the public. Presentations provided high- lights on advanced technology devel-opments - such as tissue engineering and medical nanotechnologies - that are likely to introduce revolutionary changes in medical practices. These scientific and technolog- ical developments pose extraordinary challenges to regulators : in some cas-es, there is a complete regulatory vac-uum, given the complete novelty of the subject. In others, new products may fall under the scope of existing regula-tory frameworks never conceived with those products in mind. And there are other very sensitive aspects related to the assessment of risks and hazards, as well as of public perception and accept-ance of new technologies. This highlighted the question - needing addressing rapidly - of under-standing the right moment for the devel-opment of standards for new technolo-gies. While some speakers believe that standards should be developed in par-allel with technology, other speakers believe the timing depends entirely on the safety needs of patients - take, for instance, ISO 5840 :1996, Cardiovascu- lar implants - Cardiac valve prostheses - where the development of the standard therefore ought to lead the technology. Given the nature of new tech- nologies and the speed of innovation, speakers acknowledged that it is diffi-cult to match the speed of innovation with standards development ; however, a very fine collaboration is needed for the timely development of standards. In order not to hamper tech- nological innovation and to take account of the state-of-the-art, stand-ards should reflect current, broadly applicable technologies. Where it is In addition, the development of horizontal-based standards - such as risk management, quality manage-ment and biological safety - and the participation of regulators, medical community and industry in the stand-ards development process were rec-ognized as necessary conditions to achieving a more conducive climate for the highly regulated industry. Polio patient at Amar Jyoti Research and Rehabilitation Center Delhi, India.Copyright WHO 10 ISO Focus May 2004 Teaming up for better health deemed appropriate to develop stand- ards for emerging technologies, such standards should, in particular, be con-fined to addressing fundamental safety and/or performance aspects and should be carefully drafted so as not to inhibit innovation and technical solutions. According to Richard Moore, Scientific Director of the European Medical Technology Industry Associ-ation (Eucomed), the potential range of applications and products would appear to render \" product specific \" standards inappropriate. In the medi-cal sector, a shift has already occurred towards safety and performance as a key solution to keeping pace with the rapidity of technological advances. Among other recommendations to emerge from the panel discussion was to \" sell \" the concept of standard-ization to a new constituency of stake-holders and to use alternative standards deliverables for cases where swift devel-opment and publication takes priority. 1) Reducing the \" Health Divide \" In the last session focussing on the development dimension, general agreement was reached that develop-ing countries stand to gain from the use of International Standards by help-ing to facilitate the dissemination of products, technologies and good prac-tises, safeguarding public health and safety, as well as making a greater con-tribution to economic growth. All agreed that Internation- al Standards, when harmonized, are a significant issue in enabling develop-ing countries to participate in the glo-bal trading environment. The degree to which they are used by either the exporting organization or importing designation can influence market access and trading opportunities or obstacles. At the same time, however, it was noted that greater efforts are need-ed to enhance the effective participation of developing countries in the standards development process itself. In the view of many workshop speakers, relying on the use of electronic tools such as videoconferencing and e-balloting can help developing countries avoid incurring the heavy costs of trav-el and in so doing, help facilitate their access in the standardization process. In addition, providing training opportu-nities and taking account of differenc-es in infrastructure - such as the limit-ed access to equipment, technology and funds of developing countries - were considered as \" essential \" in addressing their specific needs. ISO, for example, is helping developing countries strengthen their standards infrastructure and enabling them to participate more fully and deep-ly in the work of international standard-ization through twinning and training opportunities. \" Twinning \" is the process by which developing countries can partner with developed countries to ensure that their needs are taken into account by ISO committees when developing Inter-national Standards, as well as facilitating their greater involvement in committee governance, for example through shar-ing of secretariats and leadership posi-tions in committees. Increasing the visibility of achievements While the medical technologies sector continues to increase, there is a growing recognition of the importance of International Standards in facilitating the dissemination of products, technolo-gies and good practices for global pub-lic health and industrial competitiveness. By and large, participants agreed that it is possible not only to formulate Inter-national Standards through cooperative efforts - take, for instance, the WHO/ISO collaboration for the development of International Standards for safer injec-tion technologies - but that such stand-ards provide real added value in today's interconnected and interdependent glo-bal economy. For ISO Secretary-General Alan Bryden, \" Over the past two days we have witnessed key players in the field of medical technologies demonstrate their willingness to contribute and col-laborate on the development of stand-ards for this sector,\" he said, when draw-ing the conclusions from the confer-ence. \" Participants cited numerous suc-cess stories of how International Stand-ards help contribute to the efficiency and dissemination of medical technologies. More importantly, however, we reached consensus on the need for globally rele-vant solutions for this innovative, rapidly changing sector.\" \" We are going to pursue these directions for actions, starting with con-solidating collaboration on priorities setting and relations of standards with essential health and safety principles between the WSC members, the Glo-bal Harmonization Task Force for Medi-cal Devices and the World Health Organ-ization. We will present and increase the visibility of our achievements and pro-grammes, as well as enable the opti-mal and effective use of the system to the worldwide community of stakehold-ers. In addition to the existing collabo-ration between IEC, ISO and ITU-T, we will expand partnerships with oth-er standards developing organizations (SDOs) in order to improve coordina-tion and avoid duplication of the work that already exists. Finally, we will high-light and promote the complementarities between regulations and standards, as well as encourage the participation of all stakeholders having relevant interests in the medical technologies sector.\" 1) Publicly Available Specifications (PAS), Tech- nical Reports (TS) and Technical Specifications (TS) - can be published to respond to urgent market needs as interim committee deliverables representing lower levels of consensus. Compared to the traditional ISO process of developing Inter-national Standards through the technical commit-tee structure, International Workshop Agreements (IWA's), are developed in open workshops and organized by a national standards institute.

ISO Focus May 2004 11Main Focus Increasing health care efficiency By Dr. Erich R. Reinhardt, Siemens AG, CEO and President of Siemens Medical Solutions People around the world have a common goal : they want to stay as healthy as possible throughout their lifetime and, if they do become sick or injured, they want to return to health as quickly as pos-sible. The aim of all health care provid-ers is to help fulfil this goal. However, there is a growing need to do so more efficiently. First, demographic devel-opments are putting more and more demands on our health care systems. Simply put, populations around the world are growing older. Second, The role of standards in health care One of the most important pre- requisites to fully exploit the power of health care IT is the use of high-quality, globally-applied standards to ensure seamless interoperability between systems from different ven-both clinical and administrative workflows throughout the health care continuum. They provide a backbone that drives the availability of the right information at the right place at the right time. This is not theory. We only need to look to aviation for an excellent example of the tremendous benefits in optimizing workflows throughout the entire system. In the early days of aviation, each pilot had complete con-trol over his or her flight objective and there was no overall coordination. One can easily imagine the chaos that such an approach would cause nowadays. Today, so-called \" workflow engines \" centrally control the complete system, directing flights, constantly tracking them and making corrections, and optimizing overall safety and effi-ciency. In health care, many real and tangible outcomes are also already being achieved. For example, through the use of health care IT, incorrect and unclear prescriptions decreased by 73 % at the Soedersjukhuset Hospital in Stockholm, and at the South Carolina Heart Center in USA, report turn-around time decreased from up to 48 hours to 15 minutes. The advantages in these examples are clear : increased patient safety and quicker decisions on the right therapy. About the author Dr. Eri ch R.

His career with Siemens began in 1983 as the head of Applications Develop-ment in Magnetic Resonance (MR). In 1986, he was promoted to head the MR Division, a position that he held until 1990, when he became the Managing Director of Siemens Ltd. Bombay. After completing his assignment in India in 1993, he returned to Germany and became a Mem-ber of the Executive Board of Medical Solutions. Three months later he was nom-inated as its CEO and President. \" Not more, but less committees. Siemens alone has 68 experts in 114 committees just for health care IT standardization.\" there is a political motivation to rein in health care spending. This presents all health care participants with a clear task: we must increase health care efficiency, which means continuing to improve the quality of care while at the same time reducing its cost. And this needs to be accomplished in a patient-centred health care system, i.e. one in which patient interests guide all deci-sions, throughout the health care con-tinuum - from prevention to diagnosis, to treatment, and to rehabilitation and care. Two main levers to fulfil these objectives are innovation in medical services and technology, especially in health care IT (information technol-ogy), and process optimization. Innovative health care IT solu- tions help to coordinate and integrate A new class of PET/CT (positron emission tomography/computed tomography) scanners with high volumetric resolution.

One thing that is particularly important to note about the IHE's approach is that it utilizes existing standards, selecting the most appropriate and practically proven ones, and has not created another stan-dards developing organization. Additional areas of health care standardization Exchanging health care data is not the only area requiring addi-tional standardization efforts. Others include : medical terminology, medi-cal guidelines, and care paths, as well as their translation into various lan-guages. Standardization in these areas would help to build up \" evidence-based medicine \" faster. \" Through the use of health care IT, incorrect and unclear prescriptions decreased by 73 %.\" The goal now must be to expand such approaches beyond individual hospital departments and beyond individual hospitals, in order to allow information to be securely and seamlessly transferred among all participants throughout the health care continuum. In other words : to allow information flow parallel to workflow throughout the health care continuum. Teaming up for better health dors. There is no doubt that standards in health care have proven effective : in another health care technology domain, mechanical and electrical equipment, standards such as those from the IEC and IEEE have greatly improved patient and user safety. Only 11 % of adverse events reported for \" medical electrical equipment \" are caused by false construction 1). And IEC/TC 62 is committed to further improve this effort by also including software and human user errors in their scope. Regarding health care IT, effec- tive consortia standards are already available and in use in many innovative hospitals all over the world, e.g. : HL7 (Health Level 7) has devel- oped messages to distribute patient demographics, physician orders, and lab results inside a hospital. DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) allows the distribution, archiving in accordance with regulations, and retrieval of medical images between radiology equipment from different vendors. IEEE has introduced standards to connect equipment in intensive care units. These standards were initi- ated by health care professionals and were developed by industry. However, there is a catch to them : their applica-tion domain is limited to individual hospital departments, e.g. radiology, intensive care units, etc., since both users and vendors are often special-ized in their respective skills and prod-ucts. Nonetheless, certain information, such as a patient's name, allergies, and lab results, obviously must be shared among all departments in order to be able to optimize the hospital's overall workflow. Here the IHE (Integrating the Health Care Enterprise), a multi-discipline initiative of health care providers and more than 75 vendors, provides a good example of an initia-tive that is aimed at ensuring \" plug and play \" interoperability between different health care domains based on clearly defined use cases, actors, roles and messages - although it still A greater range of performance options in scanners enhance image, resolution and throughput as well as new IT solutions for multimodality integration. Copyright Siemens Standardized quality metrics are also needed to make the quality of medical care measurable and transpar-ent to \" customers \", to patients. With this information, it also becomes pos-sible to foster competition between health care providers, which in turn, as in any other industry, provides incen-tives for health care providers to invest in the innovative medical services and technologies that meet their customers' needs. Furthermore, standardized quality metrics provide a basis that allows better quality to be appropriately reimbursed. 1) Hartung, Medico-Technical Hazards in Clinical Settings - Findings from Evaluating 3200 Insurance Cases, 1991 ISO Focus May 2004 13Main Focus Actions going forward In order to improve standard- ization, especially regarding the use of health care IT throughout the health care continuum, the following items are now needed : Not more, but less committees.

For example, the indus-try has effectively utilized risk-man-agement principles to write standards for rapidly developing technologies, e.g. cardiac valve prostheses. In short, the industry and pro- fessions will continue to meet the chal-lenge of standards for new technolo-gies in ISO and IEC. As emerged from the WSC workshop, careful definition of realistic needs and expectations rel-ative to standards is also a challenge with new technologies.

AAMI has worked very close- ly with leaders all over the world to provide secretariat, financial and lead-ership support in important areas of international standards. AAMI admin-isters over 100 national and interna-tional technical committees and advi-sory groups. Another form of support is AAMI's policy of adopting ISO and IEC standards as new or revised Amer-ican national standards. In a relatively short period of time, the world community, working through ISO and IEC, has developed a comprehensive body of international medical device standards that enhance public safety and commerce. All invol-ved should be commended for this suc-cessful undertaking and result. Sharing intellectual property By refocusing its stand- ards programme toward internation-al standards, AAMI members made a decision to share their intellectu-al property and the resulting AAMI income with ANSI, ISO and IEC, in the interest of supporting and interna-tionalizing standards. AAMI (as are many other organizations) is still eval-uating the implications of this sharing since this decreasing form of funding is used by AAMI to support the devel-There are several impor- tant underlying principles that guide AAMI members' work on standards. These principles have contributed sig-nificantly to the success in creating an important body of international med-ical device standards. AAMI mem-bers have, by necessity, accepted and promoted these principles because of their importance in the context of an increasing use of standards in a regula-tory context. V oluntary standards obvi-ously have a quite different connota-tion when they are developed and uti-lized in a regulatory context. For example, AAMI leaders feel strongly that the value of stand-ards (and national and Internation-al Standards systems) is generated by the industry and professions, who have the most knowledge about technology and its use. Obviously, governments, ISO, IEC and national bodies have an important role in oversight and aspects of development. They are, however, primarily important customers or users of standards and experience dictates that they must not dominate or drive the creative process unless there are compelling reasons of public interest . Some leaders from govern- ments, industry and the professions are concerned about the ability of the International Standards system to develop standards for emerging and converging technologies (as evi-denced by the recent WSC workshop). \"The value of standards is generated by the industry and professions, who have the most knowledge about technology and its use.\" Only one universally adopted standard and test method A particularly important princi- ple in highly regulated markets is that there be only one universally adopt-ed standard and test method. AAMI works through ISO and IEC wher-ever possible to achieve one inter-nationally accepted standard and to avoid duplication of effort. \" Choices \" of standards is a particularly burden-some concept in a regulatory context. This may reflect lack of consensus - a problem when regulatory certainty is very important. Regulators and indus-try should be able to rely on one con-sensus standard and not have to choose among different standards. ISO Focus May 2004 15Main Focus International Standards: the flexible solution By Dr. Klaus E. Stinshoff, Chair ISO/TC 212, Clinical laboratory testing and in vitro diagnostic test systems Medical devices are high-risk products that often are used in situations where the lives of individuals and even populations are at stake. Therefore they are tightly regulated. On the other hand, medical devices cover a wide spectrum of tech-nologies and materials ranging from heavy-duty engineering to nanotech-nology and from biological prepara-tions to high-tech alloys. To regulate products with such a diverse technical basis requires a considerable breadth of expertise which, for a single agen-cy, is difficult to provide. At the same time their rate of innovation is high. Prescriptive regulations will quickly be outdated and become obstacles to the provision of state-of-the art products. A general character for essential requirements Governmental administrations have realized this dilemma and sought solutions. One consistent solution is the New and Global Approach of the Euro-pean Union. In this approach the legis-lation abstains from detailed prescrip-tive specifications. Instead, essential requirements for the safety and effi-ciency of these devices are described in a broad and general way. This general character of the essential requirements makes them independent of progress and enables regulators to formulate them without detailed expertise. How these essential require- ments can be satisfied is left open by the legal text. Instead, the European Commission mandates the development of \"harmonized\" standards that specify the essential requirements in detail and outline ways to comply with them. The mandate goes to CEN, the European Committee for Standardization. This approach has major advan- tages : individuals developing standards are selected according to their expertise, not their position in a governmental organization ; ideally they represent the three par- ties in the market - manufacturers, users and regulators - to make sure that no interest group outvotes the others, and that the biases of an \" easy way out \" (manufacturers), unrealistic expectations (users) and excessive demands (competent authorities) are avoided ; the essential requirement demand that the state of the art is taken into account. Given the rapid progress of medical technology, the state of the art cannot be encompassed by a legal text. Standards, on the other hand, can fairly easily be updated. This gives the system an unprece-dented flexibility. Similar approaches in other parts of the world The European approach is not unique. Medical devices authorities in other regions are using the concept of \" recognized standards \". In the US, for example, the use of standards follows principles laid down in the FDA Mod-ernization Act of 1997. Such standards have to be issued by a standards body that satisfies certain conditions of: transparency of its development ; con-sensus of its acceptance ; and compli-ance with the law. Specific FDA com-mittees review and evaluate candidate standards. Subsequently they will be recognized by publication, in the Fed-eral Register, of their references as well as of the devices and the regula-tions they refer to. However, recognized standards cannot be mandated. US standards bodies will probably react quickly if the FDA establishes the need for a cer-tain standard, but a formalized mech-Standards should address only essential requirements to provide for safety while encouraging technology innovation. A corollary is that stand-ards should be developed only where there are well defined patient safe-ty needs validated by risk assess-ment. This helps to avoid unnecessary standards of convenience, which can restrict technology with no benefit to the patient. People sometimes have unre- alistic expectations about standards. Standards are only one resource for achieving safety. Standards are gen-erally written for the use of profes-sionals experienced and sophisticated in the development, management and utilization of medical technology. As sophisticated professionals, they may and should use the standards - or not - as they feel appropriate. Standards are not the only effective solution for many safety or regulatory issues. Other solutions may be as or more effective. Adherence to these principles (see AAMI.org for a listing of all principles and more background on the AAMI standards programme) have enhanced efficiency, collaboration and productivity, resulting in a comprehen-sive body of International Standards responsive to the important needs of the patient, governments, industry and the professions. \" We work through ISO and IEC to achieve one internationally accepted standard and to avoid duplication of effort.\" The ISO and IEC medical device standards community should view with pride and a strong sense of accomplishment all that has been achieved, with great leadership, team-work and collaboration among many countries in the medical device stand-ards field. We will aspire to do even better in the future. 16 ISO Focus May 2004About the author Dr. Klaus tinshof f has eld senior pos i- ons at severa l medical devices ompanies and t the Swiss medical devices uthority an d is urrentl y RA/ QA Director at Digene Corp.

Even more important is the legal weight of harmonized versus rec-ognized standards : in the US concept, compliance with the recognized stand-ards does not have to be accepted as proof of compliance with the respec-tive parts of the CFR. The authorities may still request extended documen-tation. The US system, on the other hand, accepts any kind of standard as recognized, provided it has been devel-oped in an acceptable manner and it is good enough to satisfy the intend-ed purpose, while European harmo-nized standards have to be \" European Norms (EN) \". Global validity is a tough demand Regulators, conformity assess- ment bodies and industry have real-ized the value of recognized and har-monized standards versus rigid and narrow regulatory specifications. As a result the Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) has developed an important guidance document. The purpose of this document is to guide regulatory bodies to a safe, efficient and economical use of standards in their regulation. Copyright BP Plc. Teaming up for better health However, there are things that neither the GHTF nor regulators, con-formity assessment bodies or industry cannot cover : the suitability of standards for their scientific, technical or process ori-ented purpose ; the independence of standards from particular manufacturer or user interests ; the global validity and acceptance of standards. These are demands that the standards bodies will have to respond to. Some of them will be fairly easy to deal with : The technical quality of standards issued by the major global, reg-ional or national standards bodies presents a problem only in excep-tional cases. In such cases there exist mechanisms by which errors can fairly quickly be corrected and standards be amended. To avoid the predominance of partic-ular interests is a more critical issue: the ISO/IEC Directives demand bal- ance between the parties involved in the development of standards. This equilibrium is rarely attained : user organizations and regulatory agen-cies often lack the funds to attend meetings, despite the use of elec-tronic media and telephone confer-ences. If standards bodies want to achieve a true balance between the parties involved, they will have to work on mechanisms that will allow a wider and more balanced partici- pation in the standards-development process than today is generally the case. Global validity is a tough demand to respond to. True, ISO/IEC standards are global by definition, but they do not automatically fig-ure in the system of harmonized standards of the New and Global Approach of the European Union. The Vienna and Dresden Agree-ments facilitate the transposition of a standard from the global to the European system and vice versa. However, a truly global approach should avoid those auxiliary proc-esses that add time, cost, bureauc-racy, and, worst of all, uncertainty, to the development of standards. Global standards bodies should take the initiative to get directly involved in resolving this question. They should get involved with gov-ernmental bodies like the European Community, the FDA, Health Can-ada and TGAustralia. They should emphasize their contribution to the legislative process, request recog-nition and financial support, and, most importantly, demand a role in the discussion of legislation that utilizes their products. \" Regulators, conformity assessment bodies and industry have realized the value of recognized and harmonized standards versus rigid and narrow regulatory specifications.\" The effort of the global stand- ards bodies will profit all parties : it will make global compliance with gov-ernment regulations cheaper and more easily calculable for manufacturers, it will make the global surveillance of the performance of products easier and more effective, and it will make medi-cal devices safer and more efficient for the treatment of patients.

Links between regulators and standards developers By Dr. David Jefferys, Head of Device Sector, UK Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority Standards play a critical role in underpinning both the devel-opment and the regulation of medical devices and in-vitro diagnos-tics (IVDs). The generation of stan-dards is increasingly a complex global activity. In February 2004, WHO and the World Standards Cooperation brought together regulators and other stakeholders to consider whether the present arrangements are meeting the expectations and needs. In the majority of countries, the formal regulation of medical devices and of IVDs is relatively recent. Within Europe, individual countries had vol-untary schemes stretching back over several decades. However, the statu-tory control of medical devices only began in the mid-1990s with the first of a series of EU Directives. Around this time, the Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) was created. Since its inception, the GHTF has been working on an ambitious programme of regulatory convergence. Within the GHTF model it is recognized that stan-dards provide a vital tool to demon-strate compliance with the \" Essential Principles \". There is also a recognition that standards bodies should : Ensure standards reflect current broadly applicable technology ; Ensure the suitability of standards ; Ensure a coherent standards pro- gramme linked to the GHTF Essential Principles. Within medical device regula- tion, the standards programme has brought considerable benefit to both Reducing duplication of effort ; The time taken to develop a stan- dard ; The difficulties from pursuing a consensual approach ; The transparency of the process ; Ensuring the involvement of all relevant stakeholders - regulators, industry and healthcare profession-als.the industry and to public health. For the former, they have helped to ensure a transparent facilitation of inter-national trade, while for the public health they have directly contributed to ensuring a common and accept-able framework to address safety and performance. At the European level, it is recognized that there has to be a pri-oritization and hierarchical approach to standards production. This gives a priority to overarching horizontal safety standards, followed by product group standards and a low priority to individual product safety standards. This approach has served well since its adoption. \" Within medical device regulation, the standards programme has brought considerable benefit to both the industry and to public health.\" Current issues for regulators are : The timely production and intro- duction of standards ; Efficiency of the process ; Resources/affordability ; Prescriptive versus the general approach within a standard ; Coordination and prioritization of programmes ; Lab assistant at Swasthya Kalyan Blood Bank testing for HIV/AIDS Jaipur, India.Copyright WHO/Pierre Virot 18 ISO Focus May 2004Drivers for change It has to be recognized that standards are developed through a voluntary process. Even harmonized standards within the European sys-tem are not binding on companies or individual products - although there should be a clear justification provided as to why a product does not conform to a particular standard. There are a number of sig- nificant drivers for change, which are affecting both the regulators and the standards-developers. These include the globalization of both regulations and the industry. Standards need to take account of the common global safety agenda. There is a need to Teaming up for better health Developing complementary instruments It is clear that the standards community has already started to address these issues, which were use-fully explored further at the WSC Conference. It is recognized that a number of complementary instru-ments are being investigated by both partners, that include the generation of guidelines, of common technical specifications, of points-to-consider papers and of emerging issues docu-ments. These developments recognize the changing needs of the medical device industry and in particular the rapid pace of development. It is critical to ensure that standards do not inhibit \" Significant drivers for change are affecting both regulators and standards- developers.\" TB patient in Alem Kitmama, North-East of Addis-Ababa, Ethiopia. anticipate and to take account of the rapid development of new technol-ogy resulting from the convergence of scientific developments. There is also increasing movement for dialogue and partnership during the development of advanced technology products. These trends are likely to accelerate over the next few years. There are other key issues which need to be borne in mind including transparency, patient empowerment and the need to reflect the importance of \" Designing for Patient Safety \" and human factors engineering.progress, but equally that emerging consensus documents are put into the public domain at the earliest appropri-ate moment. This may mean greater reliance has to be placed on new instruments since the traditional pro-cess for developing standards may be too expensive and too slow to meet the changing environment. The challenge will be to develop an effective and efficient pro-gramme which meets the requirements of an innovative and rapidly changing sector. To achieve this, there needs to be much closer dialogue and better communication between the regulators and the standards-developers. There should also be an increased use of electronic working. It is accepted that the present system is often too burden-some and that better ways of working must be adopted. The regulators will have to ensure that appropriate prior-ity is being given to the development of those standards with a clear public health objective. Above all, it will be important to avoid duplication of effort. One of the most encouraging aspects of the WSC Conference was the recognition by all stakeholders of the new challenges, particularly those passed by new technologies. It appears that both partners have been having the same thoughts. It was therefore a good moment for the two partners to be coming together. It was recognized that, on occasions, the need to produce a consensus document has produced a possible conflict with the need to address particular safety concerns. There needs to be a frank recognition of such difficulties. It is also essential that more feedback is included so that there is greater quality assurance of the standards being developed. This should in no way been seen as a criti-cism of the standards process - rather it is a reflection of the increased matu-rity of the system. The increased cooperation and dialogue at all levels is a most wel-come feature and should ensure that standards remain fit for the purpose and continue to play an effective and pivotal role in devices regulation in the 21 st century.Copyright WHO/Pierre Virot ISO Focus May 2004 19Main Focus About the author Richard Moore s Scientific Director o f Eucomed , the European medi- al technology ssociation which represents he interests of ome 2 500 com- anies at Euro- pean level either through direct member- ship or through membership of its 20 national medical technology association members.

Nano-technology, medicine and standardization By Richard Moore, Scientific Director of Eucomed, the European Medical Technology Association This article will take a look at the rapidly advancing and excit-ing field of nanotechnology as applied to medicine and examine some of the possible implications for stand-ardization. e.g. 1\u00b5m (micron) and above whereas the laws of quantum mechanics apply below about 0,1 nm. The actual physi-cal behaviour of typical nanoparticles depends largely upon their actual size. In 1960, American Nobel Prize- winning quantum physicist Richard Feynman rather prophetically said : \"...And there is a device on the market, they tell me, by which you can write the Lord's Prayer on the head of a pin. But that's nothing, that's the most primitive halting step in the direc-tion I intend to discuss. It is a stagger- ingly small world that is below. In the year 2000, when they look back at this age, they will wonder why it was not until the year 1950 that anybody began seriously to move in this direction. \" Interestingly, researchers have now taken this famous passage and printed it at \" nano \" level in lines one molecule thick, such that the entire speech could be printed on the head of a pin several hundred times over ! Nanotechnology applications in medical devices So let us look at some of the new medical products that are now beginning to appear or are in develop-ment that utilize nanotechnology. \" Lab-on-a-chip \" devices and biosensors are in development that will be able to perform numerous different analyses simultaneously. Nanotechnology will further increase the abilities and sensitivities of these devices, e.g. by the engineering of nanofluidic systems, and detectors, electrodes and electronics at the nano level. Implantation of such devices will be possible in order to detect diseases much earlier or to continu-ously monitor physiological states. Such biosensors or cell chips could also be interfaced telematically with other implantable or external devices, or designed to release drugs when trig-gered appropriately. Research has been described on nanoparticles that will act as oxygen \" \" Lab-on-a-chip \" devices and biosensors are in development that will be able to perform numerous different analyses simultaneously.\" In one sense, the science under- lying nanotechnology is not at all new. For many decades scientists have con-sidered atoms and subatomic particles at the physical level, molecules at the chemical level and complex biochemi-cal systems and minute organisms at the biological level. What has changed in the past decade, however, has been our ability to work at the \" nano \" level to be able to produce innovative and useful materials, machines, products or processes in a multidisciplinary way, and it can now be certainly be said that \" nanotechnology \" is finally coming of age. The prefix \" nano \" is derived from the Greek for dwarf or midget and, while there are many differing definitions of nanotechnology, it is usually taken to mean work at the level of several to 100 nm (nanometres) although some researchers extend this range up to about 1 000 nm. There are one billion nanometres to a metre. One interesting fact is that familiar physi-cal laws apply at higher size levels, 20 ISO Focus May 2004 Teaming up for better health carriers and also \" artifical mechani- cal blood cells \" (sometimes called \" respirocytes \") to aid in oxygenation of poorly vascularized tissues or to mimic haemoglobin action. The development of new materials for medical use A very promising area for nan- otechnology is in the development of new materials for medical use. These include so-called \" smart materials \" designed to elicit a specific response within the body, new coatings for implants with improved biocompati-bility and nano-sculpted or nanoporous scaffolds for human tissue-engineered products that permit much improved cell proliferation through the support-ing matrix. or bioavailability and also to aid in the controlled release of compounds. It is estimated that there are currently somewhere in the region of 100 drugs based on nanotechnology at the stage of clinical trials. Further developing areas are the use of nanoparticles for molecular or genetic labelling, e.g. so-called \" quan-tum dots \", and as a possible replace-ment for viral vectors in gene therapy. Nanorobots to carry out specific therapies at cellular level Perhaps one of the most often talked about but, perhaps at the same time, \" futuristic \" applications could be in the development of nanorobots to carry out specific therapies at cellular level. Some estimates put the develop-ment of such devices at about 20-30 years from the present with many of the other medical nanotechnology products described above becoming available within six to ten years. So here are examples of some of the medical nanotechnology or nanobiotechnology developments in the \" pipeline \" and an idea of the pos-sible timescales involved. Given the usually accepted development rates for International Standards, this is not long at all. Certainly the cost of developing nanomaterials is already beginning to fall, and consideration should already be given to developing novel strate-gies, standardization \" products \" and modes of standards development that will be necessary for such a potentially rapidly-developing and wide-ranging \" enabling technology \". Because of the relatively small amounts of nanomate-rials required, or the fact that existing medical materials can be improved by nanotechnology, the medical technol-ogy sector is likely to be one of those impacted at an early stage. \" Nanotechnology may be used in the formulation of drugs to increase active surface area or bioavail- ability and to aid in the controlled release of compounds.\" Nanoengineered neuroimplants that are capable of interfacing bio-logically are under development to aid patients with visual or aural impair-ment. Such devices already exist in a microelectronic form but further devel-opment at the nanoscale could enhance their capabilities considerably. Possibly the most developed area of nanotechnology in medicine today is in the area of drug delivery and release systems. A current example is the use of specific antibodies or cells such as T-lymphocytes to carry either nano-formulated anti-cancer drugs directly to the site of tumours or metal-lic nanoparticles that can be heated by light or magnetically at the tumour site to kill the targeted cancer cells. This may be especially valuable where tumours are in sites difficult to treat by conventional means. Nanotechnology may also be used in the formulation of drugs to increase active surface area Colonies of the baterium Bacillus anthracis on blood agar. In medical applications, any use of nanotechnology will fall under one or several regulatory regimes. In the case where the primary intended mode of action will be physical or mechanical rather than pharmacologi-cal, metabolic or immunological, this will bring nanomaterials/nanotechnol-ogy into the areas typically covered by standards. While it is rather early at present to predict specific products (which may be very varied and numer-ous), horizontal standards such as the application of risk management and quality systems, biological safety and terminology are likely to be early can-didates for consideration as they are classically in the medical technology sector the \" enabling \" tools for further standardization.

Main Focus agents, which can potentially endan- ger, and have severe negative impact on humans, animals, and plants. Laboratory safety involves all aspects of the laboratory cycle, starting from before microorganisms arrive in the facility, through the training of per-sonnel, and the establishment and monitoring of safe working practices, through the proper use of reagents, materials, and equipment, through the safe storage and transport of agents, and ultimately to the terminal steril-ization and destruction of microor-ganisms. Medical laboratories can be unsafe places By Dr. Michael A. Noble, Chair, Canadian Advisory Committee to SCC for ISO/TC 212 and Member, ISO/TC 212, Working Group 1 The medical laboratory is the place where human blood, tissues, urine, and other body substances, often with dangerous microorganisms and toxic chemicals are sent for analysis. Often the equip-ment and the reagents used to per-form the required tests have their own inherent dangers. Much of the work is exacting, leading to stress, acci-dents, and injury. In order to provide the essential information that only a medical laboratory can provide, all people entering the laboratory must be trained and knowledgeable of the potential risks and hazards, and be competent to perform their task properly. Laboratorians can be assisted through this process by the creation, publication and application of standards that define how work can be done in a manner and an environ-ment that will reduce the risk of error and accident. This is the role of a new International Standard for medical laboratory safety, ISO 15190. Laboratory safety is the active, assertive process based on evidence-based principles, to ensure safety from microbial contamination or infection or toxic reaction for work-ers, the public and the environment as a result of the active manipulations of live microorganisms or their products while pursuing academic, research, industrial, and clinical investigations. The goals are to prevent laboratory-acquired infections in workers, and to prevent accidental releases of live Epidemiology of laboratory-acquired injuries Of all laboratory-associated accidents and injuries, perhaps the most established and detailed records are related to laboratory-acquired infections. Throughout the decades, microorganisms including Hepatitis B virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and HIV are consistently recognized as significant concerns. That being said, in comparison to joint and back strains, repetitive stress injuries, lacerations, punctures, burns, and toxic chemical exposures, infections may be one of the least common injuries that occur in medical laboratories. It is there-fore imperative that an International Standard for medical safety be broadly encompassing, which well describes ISO 15190. Safety as a part of quality management ISO 15190 is an independent standard, but is intimately tied to ISO 15189, Medical laboratories - Particular requirements for quality and competence ; indeed, ISO 15189 is a designated normative reference for the safety document. The connection is not superficial, as safety is integral to both quality and competency. Safety is a planned programme process, with a requirement for regular audit and review. Safety under ISO 22 ISO Focus May 2004 Teaming up for better health 15190 is a process under continuous review and improvement. Safety is enhanced when the laboratory pro-vides a safety manual that provides policies, processes, and procedures. It should be considered required read-ing by all personnel. It is important to appreciate that a safety manual only enhances safety when it is reviewed regularly and is maintained as current and up-to-date. Responsibility roles for laboratory safety At the core of ISO is the essen- tial duality of responsibility for safety. The standard indicates clearly and unambiguously that safety is at the same time everybody's responsibility and one person's responsibility. All personnel have important responsibili-ties for ensuring their own safety. Clear and specific requirements are made concerning personal practices includ-ing eating, drinking, clothing, immu-nization, and the use of personal pro-tective equipment. At the same time, it is recognized that safety practices are unlikely to be consistent unless they are the designated responsibility of an individual given the title \" safety offi-cer \". The safety officer receives his or her authority and responsibility from the laboratory director, management officers, and supervisors. The safety officer has the authority to provide expertise, advice and guidance, and importantly to stop activities that are deemed unsafe. Safe practices in a safe environment Safe practices will protect workers, but if the laboratory environ-ment is not created and maintained as a safe workplace, then the risk of error, accident, and injury arises. Part of creating a safe environ- ment is to ensure that safety equipment is present, is known to be working properly, and personnel are trained in their proper use. While sophisticated laboratories will require specialized equipment - including biological safety cabinets and chemical safety hoods (also referred to as fume hoods) and alarm systems - basic safe environ-ments are provided with simple mea-sures, and properly functioning basic equipment. Safety is enhanced by ensuring that personnel work within lighting that illuminates without glare, and by providing a comfortable work space that reduces the risk of stress requirements is within reach of every laboratory. The standard is explicit that they are essential components of a safe laboratory. \" Laboratory safety is the active, assertive process based on evidence-based principles.\" and strain, and reasonable ventilation to control heat and humidity. Safety is enhanced by reducing distracting noise levels. Safety is enhanced by ensuring security by having lockable doors, and signs that clearly indicate to workers, and others, that laboratories may con-tain materials and products that may be hazardous if not handled properly. And laboratories need to provide stations to allow for effective handwashing, and - for the very rare occasion when accidental exposures do occur - to have appropriate first aid materials available. Safe laboratories are routinely maintained as neat and clean. In order to prevent accidents, workers must have access to per-sonal protective equipment including goggles, respirator masks, protective gowns and masks, and must be trained in their use. The creation of a safe work- space by the provision of these A safe workplace is not \" an accident \" ISO 15190 is not the first document on medical la borato- ry safety. Indeed it draws upon many excellent documents from the United King-dom, Canada, the USA, and other coun-tries. In the process of creating this new International Standard, Working Group 1 has developed a consistent, helpful document that harmonizes with estab-lished national documents. ISO 15190 will fit comfortably with any laboratory with more than a few employees, in any country. The requirements for quality management systems for safety do not require large or special resources including comput-ers, and are not intended solely for lab-oratories in the developed countries. Importantly, ISO 15190 is not intended to be a comprehensive requirement for specialized laborato-ries, especially those that work with exotic and dangerous microorganisms. It is recognized that for these organ-isms, a more rigorous and specific standard is required. Providing a safe workplace in medical laboratories does not \" just hap-pen \". It is an active process of planning, implementing, monitoring, and evalua-tion with a goal towards improvement. It is the active process of ensuring knowledge and competence. It is a topic for which an international, consis-tent standard plays an important role in structure and process development. ISO 15190 is such a document. ISO Focus May 2004 23Main Focus From bone screws to pacemakers : the changing patterns of implants By Dr. Jeffrey Hallett, Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon, Chair ISO/TC 150, Implants for surgery ISO/ TC 150, Implants for surgery, produces and maintains the standards for nearly all types of implants used in surgery. Its work is therefore impor-tant for industry, government regulators, purchasers, users (surgeons) and, of course, the most important end-user, the patient - who could be any of us. The benefits of advanced surgery using implants such as artificial joints or vascular prostheses is spreading to more and more of the world's population, and new surgical techniques and innova-tive implantable devices mean that the range of surgery grows. Increasingly the effects of ageing in causing degenerative disease can be corrected by the use of surgical implants that replace the func-tion of the worn-out parts. Artificial hip joints are the most obvious example but the scope includes very complex devices such as heart pacemakers and implant-able infusion pumps. When set up in 1972, ISO/TC 150 concentrated on producing stan-dards that dealt with the detailed con-struction and dimensions of implants such as bone screws, bone plates and the intramedullary nails used to stabi-lize fractures while the bone healed. Big advances in outcomes for patients followed from specifying that only non-corroding and biocompatible metals should be used to make the implants. Over the years, our standards have responded to a rapidly developing industry, and moved away from the nuts-and-bolts \" recipe \" (construction) type of standard, towards standards that concentrate on required performance and allow that performance to be delivered in various ways that may not always be envisaged when the original standard is drawn up. New technologies boost the need for standards The arrival of new technology has had enormous impacts on the need for our standards. The changes in tech-nology may relate to the implants, result-ing in better function, or may affect situ-ations that at first glance appear remote from the implant.

He began standards work with BSI in 1981 and has always served on the committees dealing with orthopaedic implants. He was appointed chairman of ISO/TC 150 from 1996 with re-appointments from January 1999 and January 2002.

MRI scanning is not at first of obvious relevance to a surgical implant (if a different area is being scanned), but the very powerful magnetic fields have made it essential for intracranial aneu-rysm clips to be made of non-magnetic metal so that they cannot be dragged through the brain by the magnetic fields affecting the whole patient. (Metal implants attached firmly to bone are not usually a hazard.) Non-medical technol-ogy must also be taken into account. Airport security scanners, shop anti-theft devices and even mobile phones all have the potential for upsetting deli-cate electronic implants such as heart pacemakers. This is guarded against by design features in the implants and by close liaison with the relevant commit-tees governing those external non-medi-cal devices. Active implants The older types of surgical implant were inert in their function or relied on energy supplied by the patient for their function. New tech-nologies have allowed new types of implant to have their own integral power supply. They are now called active implants. The earliest examples of these were heart pacemakers, but the development of neurosurgical stimulators (Fig. 2), implantable infu- sion drug delivery devices (Fig. 3), and even artificial hearts made it necessary to set up a whole new subcommittee, ISO/TC 150/SC 6, Active implants, for active implantable devices. New technology has improved the function of older types of surgical implants. New fabric materials and new \" memory \" metals have made better methods of vascular repair pos-sible. For many years most artificial hips were fixed into the bones by using acrylic bone cement. This can produce excellent results but the use of hydroxyapatite coatings on artificial hips (Fig. 4) has brought equally good, and sometimes more reliable and long-lasting fixation by uncemented meth-ods (Fig. 5). established to look at developing sci- ence and technology, so that we can produce standards governing both mechanical and biological functions, at the time they are needed by the devel-oping industry. Close cooperation with ISO/TC 194, Biological evaluation of medical devices , is essential. Non-scientific factors are often important. Political intervention over press concerns about breast implants brought a situation where there was risk that the EU Commission might issue edicts on their con-struction and use that were not informed by the work already done in CEN and ISO committees. Extra work by WG 6, Mammary implants , of TC 285 of CEN, and WG 8, Breast implants, of ISO/TC 150 is now re-establish-ing the role of standards produced by experts for these implants.

The head is alumina oxide ceramic for smooth-ness and reduced wear. Many new surgical implants now rely for their function on the inter-action of a non-biological substrate or scaffold with biologically active con-stituents. This is the new field of tissue engineering. An early example is the use of coral or denatured animal bone as a bone graft substitute, especially with the addition of bone morpho-genic proteins to stimulate new bone growth. Skin grafts substitutes devel-oped using cell culture techniques are now in everyday use. The potential for growth in this field is huge, with the possibility of artificial livers and similar tissues on the horizon.

Broadening participation ISO/TC 150 is anxious to encourage participation in its work from countries that have not been able to contribute to standards devel-opment in the past. This includes the developing world. In this regard we have been delighted to welcome a large delegation from The People's Republic of China to our last annual plenary meeting in Turkey. We look forward to valuable input from their experts representing such a large and important part of the world population where both demand for implants and a sophisticated manufacturing industry is now established. The future will bring many new challenges and opportunities for ISO/TC 150. We shall need to maintain the present range of standards but will also have to respond to changing patterns of surgery and medical care. Robotic sur-gery is already in use and will expand rapidly. Standards for robot safety for theatre staff and patients will be needed as well as the ability to communicate effectively with imaging systems such as CT scanners. Customized produc-tion of implants for individual patients will become common and these will range from CAD/CAM \" made to mea-sure \" machining of hip joint replace-ments, to replacement organs using cell culture of the patient's own tissues on an artificial substrate. Decisions will be needed in the near future about how ISO/TC 150 should cover the two expanding fields comprising the greater volume of basic surgery in the developing world, and rapid technological advance in the developed world. We shall need to bring in additional committee exper-tise and different liaisons for the latter, and more input from developing coun-tries for the former. The healthcare sector is large and complex with many differ-ent application requirements. It constitutes one of the largest sectors of society, accounting for some 8-14 % of Gross Domestic Product in developed nations. The recent trends of a rapid development and implementation of the enterprise-wide ICT in healthcare, e-Health, electronic health records and regional health information sharing around the world have increased need for interoperability among different information systems. In 1998, ISO/TC 215, Health informatics , was estab- lished to develop harmonize Inter-national Standards for promoting inter-operability of health informatics. So far information technolo- gy appears to have been used much less than appears optimal. The rela-tive lack of robust standards in the area has been one important limiting factor. Those interested in standardization are the organizations providing healthcare Health and IT - making the most of the match By Dr. Yun Sik Kwak, Department of Medical Informatics, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea, Chair ISO/TC 215, Health informatics 26 ISO Focus May 2004 Teaming up for better health management. Today, that is largely undertaken with paper routines. It is easy to see the potential proportion of savings. A modest 1 % saving of the costs when standardized ICT is used amounts to 2 billion USD a year. services and thus buying and operat- ing health information and communi-cation systems, their industrial suppli-ers and the individuals using or being served by the systems provided. A very large number of information objects with complicated structures need to be modelled in a manner which recognizes different existing paradigms of care and encourages movement to best practice. National governments with responsibility for health planning, fund-ing bodies and insurance organizations, the medical device biomedical and pharmaceutical industry with its truly international market, research bodies, and individuals are all important stake-holder groups, the latter gaining from the efficiency of resource utilization. Healthcare professionals and the oth-er caregivers have other interests in the development of the sector and the use of technology to change the working envi-ronment, to provide new patterns of col-laborative work and improved diagno-sis and care. The requirement for standards for health informatics is dependent on uses of today's IT, but the standards programme needs also to look ahead to development trends to ensure that standards can support new uses of IT that emerge. The range in health care spans such uses as care of the individ-ual patient with personal data, improv-ing administrative support systems, pro-viding access to medical knowledge and support education, medical research, access and use of internet. Economic and social factors The costs for standardization of health informatics, met mostly through voluntary contributions from the inter-ested parties but also from contribu-tions from national governments, are minute in comparison with the poten-tial financial benefits of standardiza-tion. Although it is difficult to provide a good basis for the benefit calcula-tions, it should be noted that some 30-50 % of all working time (and costs) of the 500 billion USD European health care spending is used for information However, since health budg- ets are primarily devoted to local and national issues, recognition of, and funding for, the opportunities of devel-oping scale at an international level should be investigated. Nor should the benefits be tak- en only at the financial level. Stand-ardization of informatics is also important to empower patients to take more control of their own health. This may involve access to general med-ical knowledge as well as efficient accesses to the patient's own person-al data files and various interactions with healthcare organizations. While the potential of the Internet to assist with personal health information has been recognized, it has not yet been fully applied. The Internet will likely become an important instrument in the development of medical science, but before this occurs, however, security techniques with appropriate profiles for healthcare will be required. Legal considerations Health care is highly regulated virtually everywhere, but legal require-ments between countries vary very con-siderably. In this domain, too, ISO/TC 215 standards can help. Liability of healthcare professionals and healthcare provider organizations for the servic-es they provide is becoming more and more important. In cross-border situa-tions, particular problems appear where professional health services are per-formed using telecommunications, as well as instances where multiple juris-dictions require access to information. In some countries, manufacturers of medical equipment are liable for their product performance in that they should not cause any harm or risk to patients.

TC 215 usually applies use case analysis to introduce new work items into the process. The TC secretariat is run by ANSI and delegated to HIMSS (Health Information Management Sys-tems Society, USA). A presentation, introducing and giving an overview of TC 215 at the HIMSS Annual Confer-ence in February 2004 proved a great success. It was the first event of its kind to bring ISO/TC 215's activities into the marketplace and to show users the range of the TC's standards. What the TC 215 standards are going to bring TC 215 has started to contribute much needed health informatics stand-ards in the security, nursing terminology, clinical analyser interfacing, electronic medical record architecture and others. Its standards aim to bring bene- fits to the international healthcare com-munity and all stakeholders by an effi-cient sharing of data, by the aggregation of relevant, timely and accurate informa-tion on a patient to facilitate diagnosis, care delivery and outcomes, to safeguard and ensure the privacy of an individu-al's health information and to ensure the authentication of the individual creating the information and the individual using/accessing the information. It aims to help build the ability to compare health services and population health status for purposes of identifying effectiveness and efficiencies and ensuring the safety of medical interventions. It seeks to pro-mote the efficient exchange of informa-tion and claims among providers and payers for reimbursement purposes. It is trying to enhance information exchange supporting academic and research initia-tives to develop solutions. However, for further success, the TC requires broader representation from every continent and culture, from all expertise in the field of medicine and health such as nursing, pharma-cy, medical records, dental, alternative medicine and other healthcare related fields. In particular, industry and user representation is badly needed. ISO/TC 209 began its work on 10 documents in 1993 and to date has produced five standards, with three currently scheduled for FDIS vote and two more out for DIS vote. The work in ISO/TC 209 has been coordinated with compa-rable work in the technical commit-tees of the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and with that going on in other national standards bodies worldwide. The subject matter covered defines classes of air cleanliness, how often to test cleanrooms to prove com-pliance with these classes of air clean-liness, the test methods for evaluating cleanrooms, design and construction guidelines, operational guidelines, control of biocontamination, and con-trol of airborne molecular contamina-tion. A glossary specific to the terms, definition and units applicable to cleanrooms is also included. In addi-tion, a separate standard covers the issue of people-free clean areas such as isolators, mini-environments clean hoods and glove boxes. Exacting common denominator criteria What this means globally is that no matter where in the world you need a cleanroom environment, it can be designed, built and operated to exact-ing common denominator criteria.

Therefore whether your clean R&D or manufacturing space is in Berlin, Barcelona, Boston, Austin, Beijing, Bangalore, or Cape Town the criteria for measuring its quality of air cleanliness, its design construction and operation are all keyed to one set of performance standards - those pro-duced by ISO/TC 209. utilized for evaluating cleanrooms and clean zones. Three of these test methods are mandatory and the other 11 are voluntary, depending upon the needs of the end-users and their quality assurance criteria; ISO 14644-4 outlines the criteria for the design and construction of cleanrooms and clean zones. It has an excellent check list which should be used by everyone involved in the design, construction and use of cleanrooms and clean zones; ISO 14644-5 covers all the aspects of operating a cleanroom including such issues as operational systems, personnel clothing, training and behaviour, installation of stationary equipment, handling of portable equipment, and cleanroom clean-ing and maintenance. Issues such as ingress and egress of personnel, materials, process equipment and waste products as well as what to do during emergencies are all cov-ered; ISO 14644-6 is a compendium of terms and definitions specific to cleanrooms and clean zones. These terms are organized by affinity groups as well as alphabetically; ISO 14644-7 covers the idiosyncra- sies of cleanrooms and clean zones in which there are no personnel. Such areas are referred to as mini-environments, isolators, clean air hoods and glove boxes. There is a significant trend toward more use of these types of enclosures as cleanroom technology is dealing with smaller devices and products particularly involving nanotechnol-ogy; ISO 14644-8 deals with airborne molecular contamination.

Other fac-tors such as the outdoor environ-ment and materials of construc-tion including process/production machinery are contributing factors; ISO 14698-1 outlines the principles for dealing with biocontamination in cleanrooms and clean zones. This is of particular concern to healthcare industries such as phar-maceutical, medical device, and biotechnology; ISO 14698-2 is a companion docu- ment to ISO 14698-1, outlining methods for evaluating and inter-preting biocontamination data. This is particularly valuable in establishing validation procedures to meet regulatory criteria. The move towards nanotechnology The future presents additional challenges. The move towards nano-technology and enhanced biotechnol-ogy are forcing us to think beyond today's clean criteria. In our original 10 documents we have included good baselines for these concerns. These documents will be continuously refined to address the ever-changing need for cleaner environments. The oldest ISO cleanroom stan- dard, ISO 14644-1, is five years old in 2004, and is currently out for review. It has stood the test of time well. It has established the base criteria for defin-ing and evaluating cleanrooms and clean areas in R&D and manufacturing facilities worldwide. The 10 ISO cleanroom docu- ments contain 400 pages of the best comprehensive information available for the design, construction and use of cleanrooms and associated clean environments. They are truly global in nature and represent the best of current science and engineering. Remember us when you brush your teeth tonight. By Pierre Lewalle, Evidence and Information for Policy, World Health Organization (WHO) Central to the concerns of public authorities in all WHO (World Health Organization) Member States are the protection and the pro-motion of people's health. Changing patterns in existing and emerging diseases, the evolution of epide-miological situations, the influence of environmental circumstances as well as behavioural factors contribute to the increasing complexity of the task at hand for decision-makers. Good deci-sions must take into account the speci-ficity of the individual cases as well as the generality of the public health scene. Solutions to many problems do exist, but implementing them is often constrained by limited resources. It is therefore crucial to make sure that whatever measure is taken is the most appropriate, not only by virtue of its technical adequacy: it must also be financially affordable and have long-term beneficial impact. One area that plays a key role towards this goal is the knowledge health authorities may rely on to make their decisions. The World Health Organization, as the international pub-lic health leader and coordinator, has long been assigned the task to harmo-nize and standardize data collection on health issues. This is why international Standardization helps WHO make better decisions 30 ISO Focus May 2004Building internationally applicable instruments to monitor medical procedures In a decisive move to respond to Member States' requests to strengthen their knowledge base, WHO is now taking action to mobilize energies around the world to build internation-ally applicable instruments to monitor medical procedures and other health interventions and the expenditures associated with them. Evidence shows that a number of countries have already felt the need to develop their own classification of health interven-tions to be able to compare the nature, distribution and cost of interventions between provinces and districts nation-wide. The same principle applies to assessing responses put in place in different countries to address similar health issues. Beyond the informative knowledge of current practices, an international classification of health interventions (ICHI), as a prospective new member of the WHO-FIC, should permit to detect trends in health care needs that will forecast areas for future action. Teaming up for better health \"International standards pave the way for efficient processing of natural language medical reports and electronic patient records.\"Language-independent representations of systems of concepts WHO is fortunate to have been offered access to a number of national classifications that could serve as a starting point for international develop-ments. A large consultation has been initiated to assess countries' needs and expectations, particularly in terms of possible step-by-step implementation at a pace that the countries' resources could bear. Considering in addition the evolutionary nature of such systems, various options are currently being studied in cooperation with WHO col-laborating centres and other research institutions. They all have the col-lective mandate to suggest solutions for a versatile yet robust classifica-tion anchored on modern knowl-edge representa-tion techniques. In this major endea-vour, maximum compatibility will be sought with leading informa-tion systems. The extended search space will include HL7, UMLS, SNOMED, Galen, etc. International standards applicable to the fields of medical and health informatics will permit the exchange of informa-tion between interoperable systems and pave the way for efficient processing of natural language medical reports as well as electronic patient records. Language-independent representations of systems of concepts are particularly attractive to exchange information across language barriers. Connection with fee schedule schemes will also encourage the use of consistent lists for (co-)payment and insurance coverage of selected essential interventions. The expected result should provide a common base, on which various extensions could be built for specific purposes.It is recognized that such an ambitious project should be designed in accordance with accepted standards. The advent of a truly international classification of health interventions (ICHI) based on those standards is expected to contribute to an efficient sharing and dissemination of knowl-edge about medical procedures and other health interventions across borders. The expected product should find its rightful place in the growing family of international classifications, thus assisting decision-makers in gaining deeper understanding of the interactions of an increasing number Furthermore, proper coverage of the financial risks associated with health interventions is of great inter-est to health insurance systems, both in terms of public finances support-ing social security mechanisms and for private insurance systems offer-ing individual coverage packages. To assess and compare the effectiveness of the proposed coverage schemes, one must make sure that preferences are expressed by reference to a com-mon list of interventions that would be meaningful across borders, cultures and health systems.

Our primary goal is to coordinate develop-ment activities in order to ensure that the standards we produce are interop-erable and technically consistent. We facilitate this effort by engaging in open communication with the various standards setting bodies that work in a similar space. OASIS participation in the ISO/IEC/ITU/ECE MoU on Electronic Business Standardization is one example of our mutual efforts in this arena. Our collaboration in the MoU Management Group, in particu-lar, led to the coordinated submission of OASIS standards for approval by UNECE's CEFACT and ISO/TC 154, Processes, data elements and documents in commerce, industry and administration , as well as other discussions currently underway with ITU and IEC. On a technical level, OASIS works with our peer organizations to promote the interoperability of our specifications by encouraging repre-sentatives of our technical committees An OASIS that is no mirage An interview with Patrick Gannon, president and CEO of OASISto establish liaisons that enable them to share information with other organiza-tions. We also seek out opportunities to jointly promote the work that OASIS and our partner organizations produce. We do this through joint educational seminars, interoperabil-ity demonstrations of complimentary standards and other adoption-focused activities. ISO Focus : ISO has streamlined its procedures and introduced new deliverables for cases where swift development and publication takes priority. What have you learned from ISO's approval process of ebXML OASIS standards ? Patrick Gannon : ISO's recognition of the open development and approval processes of other organizations is extremely significant. The ebXML specifications have already gone through multiple development and approval cycles - first through the joint OASIS-UN/CEFACT initiative, and then further development and approval under the OASIS Technical Committee Process. ebXML was also reviewed and approved by the OASIS membership and then endorsed by the CEFACT Plenary in 2003. These are not new or untested specifications; a large number of experts were involved in their creation and approval, and they have been widely implemented. ISO's willingness to recognize this and allow ebXML to be approved under a streamlined process, sends a very positive signal to developers and other standards developing organiza-tions. I must also point out that we were overwhelmed by the level of assistance we received from the lead-ership of TC 154 and the ISO Central Secretariat throughout the entire submission and approval process. Everyone at ISO has been most sup-portive; we look forward to working further with this wonderful team of professionals. About OASIS OASIS is the not-for-profit, global consortium that drives the development, convergence, and adoption of e-business standards.

Patrick Gannon: OASIS intends to continue its collaboration with ISO by submitting other OASIS Standards that fit into topics of ISO/TCs and ISO/IEC JTC1 subcommittees. Most immediately, we look forward to work-ing with ISO to promote the adoption of the ISO 15000 ebXML. We have already been contacted by numerous ISO affiliates that want to coordinate ebXML adoption programmes within their countries. These standards were some of our first broad successes; there are a number of other projects that also now have reached OASIS standard status and enjoy strong implementer inter-est. Our hope is that some of our other work also will follow this path towards interoperability and greater recogni-tion by the international e-business and standards communities. Collaboration between ISO and OASIS is just beginning, as we move forward together to help individual governments and businesses appreciate how these eBusiness standards can aid in reducing their operational costs and expanding economic development. It is one thing to bring technical and busi-ness experts together to create these standards, as we have done over the past four years. The true test, however, lies in the manner in which we work together to facilitate global adoption and achieve the business objectives that fuelled the efforts of thousands of developers around the world. That is our vision for the future, and with the collaborative support of ISO, I am confident we can turn that vision into reality. By Alan Kotok, Editor, ebXML Forum The approval on 29 March 2004 of four ebXML specifications as new ISO standards marks the latest achievement by this set of documents that promises to enable any enterprise of any size do business electronically. The ebXML - short for electronic business e Xtensible Markup Language (http://www.ebxml.org/) - standards have emerged over the past three years as a stable framework for companies and organizations in Asia, Europe, and North America to exchange business data reliably and with security. ebXML is a product of hundreds of organizations and thousands of individual participants worldwide, and a testament to the open standards process. E-business is more than you think, and less The new ISO/ebXML standards address electronic exchanges between businesses. These business-to-business exchanges dwarf in volume the famil-iar retail transactions over the Web and cover the whole range of business interactions that go well beyond the buying and selling activities normally associated with electronic commerce. This encompassing view of electronic business, called collaborative com-merce, has revolutionized the way companies interact with each other, and resulted in reduced inventories, lower costs throughout supply chains, increased productivity, and better serv-ice to customers. The benefits of e-business up to now however, have gone mainly to larger enterprises. Since the 1980s, ebXML : When e-business means business ISO Focus May 2004 33About the author Alan Kotok is manag ing editor f he ditor o f ebXML F http://www.ebxmlforum.org/ , an independent Web site devoted to the ebXML standards. Kotok is also the author, with David Webber, of the book ebXML : The New Global Standard for Doing Business on the Internet , New Riders Publishing, September 2001 http://www.ebxmlbook.com/ . Developments and Initiatives companies and organizations have exchanged business data in an elec-tronic form called electronic data inter-change or EDI. Larger companies or organizations using EDI often required their smaller suppliers to adopt EDI technologies in a hub-and-spoke relationship. If you are the hub (the customer), EDI works great. If you're the supplier/spoke, however, you often have a different view. EDI can be very expensive to implement, especially if you do business in different industries, which have different implementations of EDI. For many suppliers, this means writing and maintaining separate EDI implementations for each customer, which largely negates any economies of scale. The shortcomings of EDI, along with the emergence of the Internet and XML as potential alternatives, prompt-ed OASIS and UN/CEFACT in 1999 to establish the ebXML initiative. These two groups, joined by industry organi-zations, standards bodies (including EDI organizations), and thousands of individuals worldwide developed the first set of ebXML specifications in about 18 months. The initiative had completely open processes; all you needed was an e-mail address to take part in the development and review or comment on the documents. Over this period, the initiative had quarterly meetings, held in North America, Asia, and Europe, and open to anyone. The only costs for participation were a nominal meeting fee. The ebXML standards ebXML is a series of related specifications, each addressing a set of functions needed for electronic business. Messaging - for the secure and reli- able delivery of data from one trading partner to another ; Registries - that offer an authorita- tive electronic reference point for specifications, business processes, and other documentation needed for electronic business in an industry, and companies conducting e-business in that industry. OASIS uses ebXML as the technology for its public standards registry ; see http://registry. oasis-open.org/ ; Collaboration protocol profiles and agreements - that provide the techni- cal capabilities of an enterprise and the specific details needed to estab-lish electronic business connections between companies ; Business process specifications - that identify the parties in collabo-rative business transactions, interac-tions among the parties, the specific documents exchanged, the sequence of those exchanges, and key data ele-ments exchanged ; Core components - that identify common business terms and give them a neutral name and unique iden-tifier to help companies in different industries to interact with each other. ebXML can and does support any of these scenarios (see below). The ebXML initiative designed the individual specifications to work independently as well as with each other. This modular approach encour-ages industries or trading partners to adopt ebXML in manageable chunks rather than swallowing the entire set of specifications at one time. The specifi-cations (and now ISO standards) are all offered royalty-free and are managed by recognized standards organizations, not by individual vendors or vendor consortia. OASIS has established an ebXML committee that develops appli-cation profiles and test suites to encour-age greater interoperability. ebXML applications Since its official release in May 2001, ebXML has gained significant support worldwide, particularly from organizations and companies that need secure and reliable e-business service (like that provided with EDI), but want to take advantage of the low cost and ubiquity of Internet-based technolo-gies. Here are a few examples ... Volkswagen AG is using ebXML to transact business with its dealer networks in the USA and Canada. The messages exchanged use the Open Applications Group's XML-\" ebXML is now poised to become the global engine for electronic business its designers envisioned.\" The standards approved by ISO on 29 March cover trading partner profiles and agreements, messaging, and registry information model and services, and are designated as ISO 15000-1 through ISO 15000-4 respec-tively. These specifications, submitted to ISO by OASIS, are the most stable and widely used of the ebXML docu-ments at this time. It is important to note that ebXML provides a standard framework for conducting electronic business, but does not provide the actual substance of the business messages themselves. Many industry groups are well under-way defining their own applications and vocabularies of XML to meet their business needs. Because many compa-nies and organizations involved in the development of ebXML had working EDI systems, the specifications are written to supplement and expand on EDI. Thus, ebXML and EDI are meant to work together. In some cases, industries will continue to use EDI or a combination of EDI and XML. 34 ISO Focus May 2004based format adopted by the Standard for Technology in the Automotive Retail (STAR) consortium.

Witold Suryn, secretary of the ISO/IEC technical group that devel-oped the document further explains : use of subcontractors increase, a stand-ardized way of documenting infor-mation is required to serve as a stable means of communication and to reduce the risk of misinterpretation, errors and additional costs. ISO 7200:2004, Technical prod- uct documentation - Data fields in title blocks and document headers , will facil- itate the exchange of documents and ensure compatibility not only in com-puter systems, but also in paper-based form by defining a common way of transferring and presenting information. It will serve as a platform for communication by helping to facilitate information exchange between involved parties and, in so doing, help ensure that specified requirements are fulfilled in all phases of the product life cycle, from design concept via manufacturing, maintenance to final phase-out. \" ISO 7200 intends to support information exchange between people and different computer systems,\" said Siv Velander, convenor of the working group that developed the new standard. \" It will provide for high information quality and ensure a minimum of mis-understandings.\" The new standard specifies the data fields used in the title blocks and headers of technical product documents that will allow information to be identi-fied, recognized, understood and proper-ly handled. It is applicable to all kinds of documents for all kinds of products - in all fields of engineering. ISO 7200:2004, which replac- es, ISO 7200:1984, has been updated to include the handling of information in electronic/digital form and to apply to both textual and graphical documents. ISO 7200:2004 is the work of ISO technical committee ISO/TC 10, Technical product documentation, sub- committee SC 1, Basic conventions, working group WG 6, Document man- agement. ISO 9003:2004 36 ISO Focus May 2004Coming up Main FocusDevelopments and Initiatives Protecting the environment Over the last decade, many tools have been used by industry to put environ-mental protection into practice. The ISO 14000 family of standards for environmental management systems (EMS) have become synonymous with good business practice and a competi-tive market advantage. ISO did not begin its work for environmental pro-tection with the development of ISO 14000; this management system stan-dard has, however, played a pivotal role in shaping its work in the area and taken it along way further down the road to working for sustainable deve-lopment. Indeed, ISO's commitment to the environment is present in some form in a large proportion of its com-mittees. From ergonomics to optics, from the automobile industry to the concrete, the environment is being taken into account in ISO standards that cross the spectrum of industry sectors. This month's dossier homes in on what ISO is trying to do in some of these different spheres to preserve the environment, and why standards are first-rate tools to help bolster efforts to promote fair trade, ensure cleaner industry and assist in global regula-tion-setting. The demand to ensure a better \" treat-ment \" of the environment is heard not only at the consumer level, where preference is given to products that respect the environment, but more and more strongly at the political and industrial level, where many organiza-tions are already expecting their sup-pliers to become more environmental-ly friendly. The work of ISO technical committee ISO/TC 207, Environmen- tal management, has established itself as the cornerstone of effective business practice, and increasing concern about environmental issues has significantly affected global practices in recent years as organizations seek to be res-ponsive to government regulations, shareholder concerns, and stakeholder expectations, all at the same time. That represents one aspect of the stan-dardization work in progress ; another is aiding in the creation of new clean energies, to diminish reliance on fossil or polluting fuels. ISO committees are at work here in the fields of solar ener-gy, hydrogen, and nuclear energy. Certain committees are concentrating on specific aspects of the environment, such as standards to monitor and defi-ne the quality of water, air or soil, on the measurement of winds and nano-particles in the air, for instance. With the scarcity of water, its management requires particular attention, and ISO/TC 224, Service activities relating to drinking water supply systems and wastewater systems - Quality criteria of the service and performance indica-tors, is looking for solutions to proper governance systems by holding a series of regional conferences on the subject. Other subcommittees and working groups are concerned with waste and recycling standards. And there is a body of ISO work going on in the vast issue of climate change.Creating an environmental reflex in all our actions, industrial, commercial and at the individual level is where stan-dards are playing their role in helping to protect the environment ; important work, to be implemented and furthered today - otherwise, says the ISO Vice President \" to be sorry may not be enough.\" Video compression. Digital video is being used in an increasing array of applications that have been fuelled by the development of video coding stan-dards. A new video compression stan-dard will reduce the number of bits/s required to store or transmit video signals. It represents an important step forward for video compression of the new generation of applications. Best practice for information security. ISO/IEC 17799, Code of practice for information security management, is proving to be the glo- bal best practice standard for informa-tion security. It has made its mark as a \" common language,\" as testified by the take-up by businesses across a broad spectrum of market sectors. ISO Focus will look at some of these to see where and how this standard is helping all businesses worldwide - irrespective of whether small, medium or large - to minimize business dama-ge and maximize business investments and opportunities by deploying infor-mation security best practice. Risk management is of growning concern in many fields, and ISO's standards have a ready role in helping to clarify the structure and the para-meters in which this can be carried out. ISO Focus looks at ISO 14971 and the appli-cation of risk management to medical devices. ISO Focus May 2004 When results count ! When results count ! Global markets. Global standards.
