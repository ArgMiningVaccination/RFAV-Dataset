This review will focus on describing the several strategies that could potentially reduce the incidence of late-onset cytomegalovirus disease.Methods: We reviewed the literature and presented our own clinical experience in the field.Results: The incidence of late-onset cytomegalovirus disease in recent trials can be as high as 36% in high-risk patients (donor positive/recipient negative for cytomegalovirus). The extension of antiviral prophylaxis to six months has recently proven in a prospective randomized controlled trial to be effective for reducing late-onset cytomegalovirus disease. The monitoring of cytomegalovirus viral load by PCR after the discontinuation of prophylaxis seems to be of moderate usefulness in low/intermediate-risk patients. The use of low-dose valganciclovir could reduce drug toxicity and costs while maintaining similar efficacy, but further studies are needed. A potentially interesting approach to predict the individual risk for development of cyto-megalovirus disease appears to be the assessment of specific cell-mediated immune response. If cell-mediated immunity assays become widely available in transplant centers in the future, these assays may possibly be used to tailor the cytomegalovirus preventive strategy on an individual basis. Finally, recent prospective trials have evaluated novel cytomegalovirus vaccines that merit further evaluation in the transplant setting, although currently there is no cytomegalovirus vaccine that has been approved for routine clinical use.Conclusions: Several studies have recently evaluated novel strategies to reduce the incidence of late-onset cytomegalovirus disease. It is therefore expected that this improvement in preventive strategies will allow to further reduce the negative effects of cytomegalovirus disease after transplantation.

During the first era of transplantation, CMV infection was associated with significant mortality, graft loss, and an increased incidence of invasive bacte-rial and fungal infection 2. The introduction of routine strategies for prevention of CMV in - fection and disease and the improvement of antiviral therapies have led to a considerable reduction in CMV-associated morbidity. In ad-dition, CMV is nowadays a very rare cause of mortality after solid-organ transplantation. Des - pite these major advances, some challenges remain in the management of CMV infection. Cytomegalovirus disease appearing after the discontinuation of antiviral prophylaxis, i.e. \"late-onset CMV disease\", is relatively common and is associated with some morbidity after solid-organ transplantation (Fig. 1) 3,4.In this article, we will describe the clin- ical manifestations and risk factors for late-onset CMV disease. We will then review the preventive strategies for reducing the inci - dence of CMV disease. Clinical manifestations and risk factors for late-onset cytomegalovirus disease The incidence of late-onset CMV dis - ease depends on the CMV serostatus of do- nor and recipient, the type of organ transplant, and the immunosuppressive regimen used for induction and maintenance therapy. In trans-plant centers using universal prophylaxis for all patients at risk for CMV, overall rates of CMV disease vary between 5-15% 5. If only CMV do- nor positive/recipient negative (D+/R-) patients are analyzed, then the incidence can be as high as 30-40% (Table 1) 5-10. Lung transplant Risk period without prophylaxis 60-70% in D+/R- 30-40% in D +/R- patientsRisk period after prophylaxis Prophylaxis Transplantation 3 months 6 months 9 months 12 monthsIncidence of CMV disease Figure 1. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease without prophylaxis (upper part) and late-onset CMV disease following antiviral prophylaxis (lower part). A standard three-month period of antiviral prophylaxis can reduce by half the incidence of CMV disease, also delaying the onset of the infection (late-onset CMV disease). Adapted with permission from Manuel, et al.3.Trends in Transplantation 2010;4 38recipients are generally at higher risk for de- veloping CMV disease than other organ trans-plant recipients, although most of these patients now receive longer periods of prophylaxis, and therefore the incidence is lower than pre-viously observed 11,12. Although patients receiv- ing induction therapy with antilymphocyte glob - ulins are at higher risk for CMV, these patients generally receive universal antiviral prophylaxis, so that the risk for the development of CMV disease is attenuated at the time of prophy - laxis discontinuation 13. It is generally accepted that late-onset CMV disease is seen only in patients receiv-ing antiviral prophylaxis after its discontinua-tion. Since most centers are using antiviral prophylaxis for D +/R- patients and this population is at the highest risk for developing late-onset CMV disease, the experience with late-on-set CMV disease in D +/R- using a preemptive approach is less well defined. Some centers have reported low rates of CMV disease in high-risk patients followed by a preemptive approach 14. This is in contrast with our own previous experience, when all organ trans-plant recipients were followed by a preemp-tive approach 15. Indeed, D+/R- patients were at high risk for developing recurrent or pro - tracted (> 30 days of viremia) CMV disease. For example, in the D +/R- pa- tients (76%) developed CMV infection, and 18/19 of those (95%) had a protracted course that generally required multiple courses of antiviral therapy 15. The consequences of late-onset CMV disease are not completely established4,16. It is clear that without any preventive strategy in place, CMV can be associated with acute rejection, graft loss, opportunistic infections, and even a higher mortality 2. Several meta- analyses have shown that antiviral prophy-laxis reduces not only the incidence of CMV disease, but also the incidence of acute rejec-tion and the all-causes mortality 16-19. On the contrary, the potential advantages of the pre-emptive approach to decrease the indirect effects of CMV are less strongly proven, al-though the majority of recent studies using this approach showed a low rate of adverse outcomes 20,21. Therefore, it appears that CMV disease occurring after any appropriate pre-ventive strategy (prophylaxis or preemptive) should be associated with less morbidity. This is indeed consistent with our experience as we Table 1.

Oriol Manuel and Manuel Pascual: Prevention of late-onset CMV disease 39did not find any differences in terms of out- comes (including allograft function) in kidney transplant recipients with or without late-onset CMV disease 8. However, other studies have found an association between late-onset CMV disease and a higher mortality in kidney and liver transplant recipients 22,23. In a cohort of 176 D+/R- kidney transplant recipients receiv- ing three months of oral ganciclovir (GCV) or valganciclovir (VGC), the occurrence of tissue-invasive CMV disease after prophylaxis was associated with allograft loss or mortality (HR: 2.85; p = 0.016) 22. Limaye, et al. also found a relationship between CMV disease and mortality at one year (HR: 5.1; p = 0.002), especially in case of infection-associated mortality (HR: 11; p = 0.002) in 437 liver transplant recipients 23. The lack of associa- tion between late-onset CMV disease and mortality in our series could perhaps be ex-plained by the fact that patients were promptly diagnosed and treated, thus avoiding the oc-currence of CMV-associated indirect effects 8. Valganciclovir as antiviral drug for cytomegalovirus prophylaxis Valganciclovir has become the drug of choice for CMV prophylaxis, and it is used in the majority of centers in the USA and Europe24. The advantage of VGC compared to oral GCV is its enhanced bioavailability, allowing hav - ing a higher GCV exposure with a once-a-day medication. Valganciclovir was compared to oral GCV (the PV16000 study, a multicenter trial) in more than 300 solid-organ transplant recipients (mainly kidney and liver) 10. There were no differences in terms of late-onset CMV disease between the two groups at 12 months (17.2% in the VGC group vs. 18.4% in the GCV group), although there was a higher incidence of tissue-invasive disease in the VGC group in the subgroup of liver transplant recipients. Second, there was a trend towards more neu-tropenia in the VGC group 25. Recently, some studies have somewhat challenged the preferential use of VGC as the drug of choice for CMV prophylaxis. First, Shi-ley, et al. retrospectively compared the inci-dence of CMV disease occurring after VGC prophylaxis with an historical cohort of patients receiving oral GCV in liver transplant recipi-ents 26. Concordant with the PV16000 study, patients who received VGC had a higher risk for developing late-onset CMV disease than those receiving oral GCV. A recently published meta-analysis also assessed the efficacy of safety of VGC as prophylaxis for CMV 27. In this analysis, the risk of late-onset CMV disease was similar in patients using VGC and GCV, but surprisingly it was higher compared to pa - tients using other antiviral therapies (basically acyclovir and valacyclovir). Again, the risk of late-onset CMV disease was higher in liver transplant recipients receiving VGC, and the risk of neutropenia was also higher in patients on VGC. Although the consequences of neutropenia were not discussed in this study, our experience indicates that neutropenia in patients receiving VGC can be resolved without complications if VGC is temporarily discontinued 5. Despite these two studies26,27, most transplant physicians in charge of solid-organ transplant patients acknowledge the major improvements achieved in the manage - ment of CMV infection since the introduction of VGC 16,28. Valganciclovir remains a very con- venient and efficacious drug for the prevention of CMV disease after organ transplantation. Strategies for preventing late-onset cytomegalovirus disease Several strategies exist to reduce the incidence of late-onset CMV disease in solid- organ transplant recipients. Since both anti - viral prophylaxis and preemptive therapy ef - ficiently reduce the incidence of CMV Transplantation 2010;4 40in low/intermediate-risk seropositive recipi- ents (to levels of less than 5%), this section will focus on the population at the highest risk for CMV-related complications, i.e. D +/R- patients. Prolonging antiviral prophylaxis One possible strategy to reduce the in- cidence of late-onset CMV disease is to ex-tend the duration of antiviral prophylaxis be-yond the \"standard\" three-month period. Some data based on retrospective studies suggest a benefit of this strategy in kidney and lung transplant recipients. For example, Zamora, et al. showed that lung transplant recipients who received less than six months of VGC had a higher risk of developing CMV disease (6.9%; n = 29) than patients who received longer period of antiviral prophylaxis (0%; n = 61) 12. Recently, a small retrospective study in D+/R- lung transplant recipients showed very similar results, with 44 vs. 13% of CMV disease in patients receiving three vs. 12 months of anti-viral prophylaxis, respectively 11. As a conse- quence of these studies, the majority of cen-ters are now using at least six months of VGC as the standard duration of prophy-laxis in lung transplant recipients. Interest-ingly, some rare centers have used lifelong antiviral prophylaxis, seeing a reduction on the incidence of obliterative bronchiolitis, although the cost-effectiveness of this strategy has not been evaluated 29. Regarding kidney transplant recipients, a retrospective comparison of two historical cohorts of patients receiving three vs. six months of prophylaxis indicated also a benefit of prolonging prophylaxis 30. Again, no higher rate of adverse events was seen in the six-month group of patients. At the American Transplant Congress (Boston, 2009), Humar, et al. presented the results of the IMPACT clinical trial, which com-pared 100 vs. 200 days of antiviral prophy-laxis with VGC in high-risk (i.e. D +/R-) kidney transplant recipients6. The IMPACT trial showed a significant reduction of CMV disease in the 200-days group (16 vs. 36% in the 100-days group), without a higher incidence of drug-re-lated adverse events. Incidence of acute rejec-tion and graft loss was overall low in both groups, and no significant differences were observed. No data is available regarding long-term outcomes in patients with or without CMV disease. The relatively high incidence of CMV disease in the 100-days group (36%, higher than for example 18% in the PV16000 study) could be explained by the new defini-tions used for CMV disease, e.g. fever > 1 day was not a necessary criteria for diagnosing CMV disease. Preemptive therapy after antiviral prophylaxis (\"hybrid\" approach) Since the onset of CMV disease corre- lates with the slope of viral load in blood31, the monitoring of CMV viremia after the discontinu- ation of antiviral prophylaxis using a quantita-tive method (generally measuring of CMV DNA by PCR) could potentially identify patients with low-grade viremia before they eventu - ally develop CMV-associated symptoms. This preemptive approach after prophylaxis, or \"hybrid\" approach according to some au-thors 32, has not been extensively studied due to the difficulty of organizing regular monitor - ing in patients a long time after transplanta-tion (> 3-6 months). Humar, et al. evaluated the usefulness of the monitoring of PCR ev-ery 2-4 weeks after three months of GCV or VGC prophylaxis in D +/R- organ transplant recipients33. According to their study, ap- proximately one-third of late-onset CMV dis - ease could have been avoided using this strategy. Our own recent experience with reg-ular monitoring after prophylaxis indicates that most of the low/intermediate-risk patients (R + recipients) present either with no or low- grade viremia without consequences, whereas Oriol Manuel and Manuel Pascual: Prevention of late-onset CMV disease 41D+/R- patients often present with simultane- ous viremia and CMV disease, which can be difficult to prevent even with appropriate PCR monitoring (Boillat, et al., manuscript in prep-aration). Low-dose valganciclovir and delayed prophylaxis Some pharmacokinetic studies have shown that the GCV exposure of daily oral GCV (3 g) is similar than that of half a dose of VGC (i.e. 450 mg daily instead of 900 mg for normal kidney function) 34. Because oral GCV is an equally effective drug as compared to VGC10, and oral GCV is associated with slightly less neutropenia, low-dose VGC may be an attrac-tive strategy to reduce adverse events and costs, while effectively preventing tissue-inva-sive CMV disease. Some studies using VGC 450 mg instead of 900 mg have shown a similar efficacy than that obtained with VGC 900 mg, although most of these studies have been retrospective 35,36. Indeed, in the majority of these studies, a \"low dose\" was actually a \"fixed dose\", i.e., the dose of 450 mg was after not adapted to kidney function 37. In a prospec- tive pharmacokinetic study from our institution, we found that GCV exposure after administra-tion of VGC 450 mg daily in recipients with normal kidney function was comparable to that reported with oral GCV in the PV16000 study (29.6 vs. 28.0 mg\u00b7h/l, respectively) 38. No major differences in adverse events according to GCV exposure were observed. In the meta-analysis by Kalil, et al. the rate of adverse events was also similar between low-dose vs. standard-dose VGC 27. Recently, an original study evaluated a new strategy for reducing the incidence of late-onset CMV disease, consisting in initiat - ing antiviral prophylaxis between 14-21 days after transplantation in D +/R- organ transplant recipients39. Only 5.5% of the patients (1/18) developed CMV disease compared to 27% (7/26) of patients in the conventional group (p = 0.07) in which prophylaxis was initiated at a median of 14 days after transplant. Of note, no patients received thymoglobulin in the de-layed-prophylaxis group. According to the authors, this strategy might allow the transplant recipient to be exposed to CMV and, therefore, to start mounting a specific immune response against CMV, although no detailed assess-ment of cell-mediated immune response was described to confirm this hypothesis. Although potentially interesting, these strategies need confirmation in larger studies. Monitoring of cytomegalovirus-specific cell-mediated immunity Both B-cell and T-cell mediated immune response play a key role in the control of CMV infection in solid-organ transplant recipients 40. Theoretically, the assessment of the humoral and cellular immune response at the time of discontinuation of antiviral prophylaxis could identify the patients at highest risk for the de-velopment of CMV disease 41. These patients could thus benefit from a reduction of immu-nosuppression or from an extension of anti-viral prophylaxis. Regarding humoral immunity, a sub- study of the PV16000 trial evaluated the use-fulness of CMV serology in predicting the development of CMV disease in high-risk D +/R- solid-organ transplant recipients42. Over- all, patients who seroconverted at the end of the prophylaxis period (three months) had a similar risk of developing CMV disease as pa-tients who remained serologically CMV nega-tive, thus showing that serology alone is of limited value for predicting CMV disease. More recently, there has been an in - creasing interest in measuring specific cell-mediated immunity as a tool to identify the patients at higher risk for developing CMV Trends in Transplantation 2010;4 42disease43-46. Examples of ex the detection of interferon- secreting cells in response to in vitro CMV antigen stimulation. Because most of these assays have been tested in experimental set-tings using in-house assays, it has been dif-ficult so far to validate and incorporate them in the routine clinical practice. A new assay called QuantiFERON \u00ae-CMV (Cellestis) has been recently evaluated as a test to predict CMV disease in transplant recipients at high risk for CMV disease (i.e. D +/R- patients, patients receiving thymoglobulin, and lung transplant recipients) 47. This assay also mea- sures the in vitro release of interferon- by secreting cells, and is very similar to the QuantiFERON \u00ae-TB in Tube assay48, which is extensively used for the diagnosis of latent tu - berculosis infection. Thus the main advantage of the QuantiFERON \u00ae-CMV assay is to use a standardized test that can be performed even in centers without research capability 49. Kumar, et al. showed that patients with a detectable interferon- response at the time of prophylaxis discontinuation had a lower risk for developing CMV disease compared to those patients with a negative response (5.3 vs. 22.9% patients, respectively; p = 0.038) 47. To confirm or not these results, an international multicenter trial in D +/R- organ transplant recipients is currently ongoing using the QuantiFERON\u00ae-CMV assay. If confirmed, these assays could be used in the near future to tailor CMV preventive strat - egies on an individual basis according to the actual risk for the development of CMV disease, and not only based in general markers 50. Vaccination Finally, a paramount achievement in the prevention of CMV after transplantation would be the development of a protective vaccine against CMV. The challenges associated with CMV vaccination have been recently nicely reviewed by others 51,52. Currently, there is no CMV vaccine that has been approved for use in the routine clinical setting. Two recent pro-spective trials have evaluated novel CMV vac - cines that merit further evaluation in the trans-plant setting. First, Pass, et al. evaluated a vaccine in seronegative women consisting of recombinant CMV envelope glycoprotein B with MF59 adjuvant 53. Vaccine efficacy was evaluated at approximately 50%, decreasing the subsequent incidence of maternal CMV infection. It is not known, however, whether this vaccine would be protective in solid-organ transplant recipients, since the glycoprotein B elicits predominantly a humoral response, and T-cell mediated immunity seems to play a more important role in the control of CMV infection in transplant recipients. Second, a bivalent CMV vaccine using DNA technology showed promising results in terms of safety and im-munogenicity in healthy volunteers. This vac-cine is composed by pp65 antigen and glyco-protein B in order to boost both cell-mediated and humoral immunity 54. A trial using this vac- cine in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients is ongoing. Summary and conclusions In parallel to the remarkable reduction in the incidence of acute rejection and graft loss over the last 10 years due to the improve-ment in the immunosuppressive regimens af-ter solid-organ transplantation, the routine us-age of universal preventive strategies has also significantly decreased the CMV infection in-cidence and the morbidity and mortality as-sociated to viral infection. Cytomegalovirus is not anymore the feared virus that could jeop-ardize the kidney allograft or even the patient's life. The typical kidney transplant recipient with CMV disease generally presents now with mild-to-moderate disease (fatigue, low-grade fever, Oriol Manuel and Manuel Pascual: Prevention of late-onset CMV disease 43diarrhea), and can be treated in an outpatient setting with oral VGC55,56. Cytomegalovirus- associated complications are seen only in a minority of patients, e.g. those severely immu-nosuppressed. Nevertheless, the incidence of late-onset CMV disease after prophylaxis dis-continuation remains too high. Over recent years, several studies have evaluated novel strategies to reduce the inci-dence of late-onset CMV disease. Some of these, such as the extension of the period of prophylaxis (IMPACT study), are already be-coming the standard of care in the clinical setting for D +/R- patients. Other approaches that have shown promising results, such as the use of cell-mediated immune assays to predict CMV disease, are currently under evaluation in larger trials. It is therefore ex-pected that over the coming years this new progress in delineating the optimal preventive strategies of CMV after transplantation will al-low us to further reduce the negative effects of this important viral infection.
