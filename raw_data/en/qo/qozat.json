Despite a growing body of evidence about the safety and efficacy of vaccination, many chiropractors do not believe in vaccination, will not recommend it to their patients, and place emphasis on risk rather than benefit. In case you wonder where this odd behaviour comes from, you best look into the history of chiropractic. D. D. Palmer, the magnetic healer who 'invented' chiropractic about 120 years ago, left no doubt about his profound disgust for immunisation: \"It is the very height of absurdity to strive to 'protect' any person from smallpox and other malady by inoculating them with a filthy animal poison... No one will ever pollute the blood of any member of my family unless he cares to walk over my dead body... \" (D. D. Palmer, 1910) D. D. Palmer's son, B. J. Palmer (after literally walking [actually it was driving] over his father's body) provided a much more detailed explanation for chiropractors' rejection of immunisation: \"Chiropractors have found in every disease that is supposed to be contagious, a cause in the spine. In the spinal column we will find a subluxation that corresponds to every type of disease... If we had one hundred cases of small-pox, I can prove to you, in one, you will find a subluxation and you will find the same condition in the other ninety-nine. I adjust one and return his function to normal... There is no contagious disease... There is no infection...The idea of poisoning healthy people with vaccine virus... is irrational. People make a great ado if exposed to a contagious disease, but they submit to being inoculated with rotten pus, which if it takes, is warranted to give them a disease\" (B. J. Palmer, 1909) Such sentiments and opinions are still prevalent in the chiropractic profession - but today they are expressed in a far less abrupt, more politically correct language: [The International Chiropractors Association](http://www.chiropractic.org/?p=ica/policies#immunization) recognizes that the use of vaccines is not without risk. The ICA supports each individual's right to select his or her own health care and to be made aware of the possible adverse effects of vaccines upon a human body. In accordance with such principles and based upon the individual's right to freedom of choice, the ICA is opposed to compulsory programs which infringe upon such rights. The International Chiropractors Association is supportive of a conscience clause or waiver in compulsory vaccination laws, providing an elective course of action for all regarding immunization, thereby allowing patients freedom of choice in matters affecting their bodies and health. Not all chiropractors share such opinions. The chiropractic profession is currently divided over the issue of immunisation. Some chiropractors now realise that immunisations have been one of the most successful interventions ever for public health. Many others, however, do still vehemently adhere to the gospel of the Palmers. [Statements like the following](http://www.planetc1.com/chiropractic-articles/Chiropractic_Position_On_Vaccines.html) abound: Vaccines. What are we taught? That vaccines came on the scene just in time to save civilization from the ravages of infectious diseases. That vaccines are scientifically formulated to confer immunity to certain diseases; that they are safe and effective. That if we stop vaccinating, epidemics will return...And then one day you'll be shocked to discover that ... your \"medical\" point of view is unscientific, according to many of the world's top researchers and scientists. That many state and national legislatures all over the world are now passing laws to exclude compulsory vaccines.... Our original blood was good enough. What a thing to say about one of the most sublime substances in the universe. Our original professional philosophy was also good enough. What a thing to say about the most evolved healing concept since we crawled out of the ocean. Perhaps we can arrive at a position of profound gratitude if we could finally appreciate the identity, the oneness, the nobility of an uncontaminated unrestricted nervous system and an inviolate bloodstream. In such a place, is not the chiropractic position on vaccines self-evident, crystal clear, and as plain as the sun in the sky? Yes, I do agree: the position of far too many chiropractors is 'crystal clear' - unfortunately it is also dangerously wrong. "}
