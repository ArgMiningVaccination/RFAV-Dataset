Currently, health experts have not found COVID-19 in human milk. If you are breastfeeding or feeding your child expressed milk, continue to do so as often as possible. Breast milk provides passive immunity, this helps protect your baby against other infections. [Passive immunity](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/childrens-health/how-long-do-babies-carry-their-mothers-immunity/) means your baby has been given the antibodies rather than making them itself. For families who have made an informed decision to use infant formula, continue to safely prepare and store infant formula as described on the product label. Find more information on how to safely feed your baby during COVID-19 using infant formula from [Perinatal Services BC](http://www.perinatalservicesbc.ca/Documents/Resources/Alerts/FAQ-Covid19-Formula-Feeding.pdf). Infant formula is available in retail and online stores. If you cannot find or are concerned about the availability of the formula you normally use: - If you are combining breastfeeding and formula feeding, consider breastfeeding more often to increase your milk supply. If you have recently stopped, it may be possible to restart. Find out more from [HealthLink BC](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-topics/relactation). - Try a different brand or type of formula. For example, ready-to-feed, liquid concentrate or powder. Any formula labelled for use from 0 to 12 months is safe for your baby, unless your baby is on a special formula. If so, contact your healthcare provider. - Do not dilute formula with extra water to make your supply last longer. This will not provide your baby with the nutrition needed for healthy growth. - Making your own homemade formula is not recommended. If you have run out of infant formula or need advice, call 8-1-1 to speak with a nurse or dietitian at HealthLink BC.
