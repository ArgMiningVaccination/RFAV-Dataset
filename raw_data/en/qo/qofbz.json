Gestational age Gestational age refers to how far along the fetus is. Many issues that affect newborns are related to the gestational age because it reflects the newborn's degree of physical maturity at birth. The gestational age is the number of weeks between the first day of the mother's last menstrual period and the day of delivery. This time frame is often adjusted according to other information doctors receive, including the results of early ultrasound scans, which give additional information regarding the gestational age. Babies are estimated to be due (the due date) at a gestational age of 40 weeks. Newborns are classified by gestational age as Full term: Delivered at 37 to before 41 weeks of gestation Late term: Delivered at 41 to before 42 weeks of gestation Doctors also use the results of a physical examination and the physical features of the newborn ( see [Physical Features of a Premature Newborn](/home/children-s-health-issues/general-problems-in-newborns/preterm-premature-newborns#v36970620) [ Physical Features of a Premature Newborn ](/home/children-s-health-issues/general-problems-in-newborns/preterm-premature-newborns#v36970620) ) to confirm gestational age. Problems Before Birth Problems in a newborn may have begun before birth. Problems that develop before birth may be related to conditions in the mother that existed before the pregnancy or developed during the pregnancy, or to conditions in the fetus.

Thyroid disease with a high thyroid hormone level (hyperthyroidism) may cause the fetus and newborn to have an overactive thyroid gland. In the United States, most states require newborns to be screened for thyroid disease. Maternal medication and drug use Most prescription medications are safe during pregnancy, but women should review all their medications with their doctor when they become pregnant or plan to become pregnant. However, even prescription medications that cause some risk may still be necessary for women. Uncontrolled medical problems in the mother also can be dangerous to the fetus.

Mothers should be aware of the ingredients of any painkiller they take. Opioid drugs such as methadone and buprenorphine that are sometimes used to treat a mother's opioid dependence also can cause withdrawal symptoms in newborns. Newborns withdrawing from methadone may need longer treatment than newborns withdrawing from other opioids. Cocaine increases the risk of poor growth of the fetus and prematurity.

Knowing the fetus's gestational age and birth defects helps doctors anticipate problems that could develop at birth. However, ultrasonography is not 100% accurate. Some babies are born with birth defects that were not detected with ultrasonography. During pregnancy, a woman's uterus will house and protect a developing fetus for about 9 months. Throughout the pregnancy, the development of the fetus can be monitored by routine ultrasounds. An ultrasound is a procedure that allows a physician to examine internal anatomy through the use of high-frequency sound waves. A transducer is placed against the skin of the abdomen and gently moved around while it emits harmless sound waves into the body. The sound waves reflect, or echo, off structures within the abdomen, such as the fetus. The sound wave signals are interpreted by a computer and displayed on a monitor. With these images, the physician can examine the fetus and evaluate the progress of its development.

The blood test is done in the first trimester and is often combined with ultrasonography to measure the thickness of the skin folds of the neck of the fetus. Some of the blood tests may be repeated in the second trimester, and this combination of tests is referred to as a sequential screen. If the results of the screening tests indicate a high risk of abnormalities in the fetus, the mother is offered further testing, most commonly a test called noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS) or cell-free fetal DNA testing. NIPS involves genetic testing of the small amounts of fetal DNA that leak from the fetus's circulation into the mother's blood. In some cases, doctors do tests on cells from the fetus using samples taken with a needle from the amniotic fluid ( [amniocentesis](/home/women-s-health-issues/detection-of-genetic-disorders-before-and-during-pregnancy/prenatal-diagnostic-testing#v45388368) [ Amniocentesis Prenatal diagnostic testing involves testing the fetus before birth (prenatally) to determine whether the fetus has certain abnormalities, including certain hereditary or spontaneous genetic... read more diagnostic testing involves testing the fetus before birth (prenatally) to determine whether the fetus has certain abnormalities, including certain hereditary or spontaneous genetic... read more ](/home/women-s-health-issues/detection-of-genetic-disorders-before-and-during-pregnancy/prenatal-diagnostic-testing#v808954) ), or the umbilical cord (cordocentesis). Increasingly, NIPS combined with a single blood test of the alpha-fetoprotein level is replacing the triple, quad, and sequential screens. This approach to testing has increased accuracy at an overall lower cost.

MRI may give additional information about an abnormality and can be useful in evaluating treatment options. Fetoscopy is an invasive test in which doctors insert a small viewing scope (endoscope) into the womb. Early in pregnancy, the scope may be inserted through the mother's cervix. Later in pregnancy, the scope is inserted through a small incision in the mother's abdomen and then another incision in the uterus. The scope lets doctors take a direct look at the placenta and fetus to identify (and sometimes treat) disorders in the fetus.

Newborns are further classified into three groups by how much they weigh compared to other newborns of the same gestational age.

For example, preterm newborns are at increased risk of breathing problems because their lungs may not be fully developed. Large-for-gestational-age newborns may have more difficult births and be at increased risk of low blood sugar (glucose). Treatment Medical treatment of specific disorders is discussed elsewhere. When possible, the sickest newborns (neonates) are cared for in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) The [NICU](/home/children-s-health-issues/general-problems-in-newborns/overview-of-general-problems-in-newborns#v36969937) [ Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) Problems in newborns may develop Before birth while the fetus is growing During labor and delivery After birth About 9% of newborns need special care after birth due to prematurity, problems... read more ](/home/children-s-health-issues/general-problems-in-newborns/overview-of-general-problems-in-newborns#v36969937) is a specialized facility that brings together the medical team and technology needed to care for newborns (neonates) with various disorders. Newborns may need such specialized care because of Respiratory disorders Low blood sugar (glucose) The NICU team is typically directed by neonatologists (pediatricians specially trained to manage the problems of newborns). Much of the care is delivered by specialized neonatal nurses. Other team members may include pediatricians, neonatal nurse practitioners (advanced-degree nurses specifically trained to manage newborns), neonatal physician assistants, respiratory therapists, social workers, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, and other specialized personnel. Many NICUs also have doctors and students in training. Depending on the care required by the baby, medical and surgical subspecialist physicians are also often involved. In the NICU, newborns are cared for in incubators or radiant warmers, which keep them warm while allowing staff to observe and treat them. Babies are usually connected to monitors that continuously measure their heart rate, breathing, blood pressure, and oxygen levels in the blood. They may have catheters placed inside an artery or in the vein running inside the umbilical cord to permit continuous blood pressure monitoring, to allow repeated blood sampling, and to give fluids and medications. NICU facilities vary widely. Some NICUs have wards in which many babies share a large space, some have modules with a few babies in a space, and some have private rooms for a family and their baby. Regardless of the layout, NICU personnel are focused on meeting the parents' need for time and privacy to become acquainted with their newborn; to learn the newborn's personality, likes, and dislikes; and ultimately to learn any special care that they will need to provide at home. Visiting hours vary but are usually flexible so that families can spend as much time with their newborn as they wish. Some hospitals have sleeping facilities for parents on-site or nearby. Many NICUs have cameras, which allows parents to see their baby even when they cannot be present in the NICU. Sometimes, parents feel that they have little to offer their newborn in a NICU. However, their presence, including stroking, speaking, and singing to their newborn, is very important. Newborns hear their parents' voices even before birth and are accustomed to them so they often respond better to their own parents' attempts to calm them. Skin-to-skin contact (also called kangaroo care), in which the newborn is allowed to lie directly on the mother's or father's chest, is comforting to the newborn and enhances bonding.

NICU personnel strongly encourage mothers to breastfeed directly or provide breast milk in a bottle when their infant's condition permits. Depending on their gestational age and medical problems, infants in a NICU may not be able to breastfeed or drink breast milk from a bottle, but, in most cases, they can still receive breast milk through a feeding tube that is placed in their nose and goes to their stomach. Preterm infants are not able to suck adequately and are not able to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing. Full-term infants in the NICU may have respiratory problems or other illnesses that make breastfeeding impossible. But, because breast milk is clearly the best food for newborns, mothers are encouraged to pump their breast milk so it can be given to their baby through a feeding tube or saved for later use. NICU personnel understand that parents need to be kept up to date on their baby's condition and expected course, the care plan, and the estimated time of discharge. Regular discussions with the nurses and medical team are beneficial. Many NICUs also have social workers who help communicate with the parents and assist in arranging family and medical services.
