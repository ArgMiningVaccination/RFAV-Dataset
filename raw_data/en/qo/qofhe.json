However, some parts of the guideline may not be applicable in emergency mental health admissions where alcohol detoxification may be required e.g. monitoring before admission, post -disch arge follow up or medication to prevent relapse. Hospital admissions are a good opportunity to counsel patients about their alcohol use and its impact on health and to plant seeds of change in the patient's lifestyle choices. At the end of this guideline t here are links for further education around delivering alcohol identification and brief advice in the hospital setting through e - learning for health. T here are also useful resources for patients to help shift their thinking from pre -contemplative to contem plative and eventually action. PURPOSE To provide guidance on the management of alcohol detoxification on inpatient units. DEFINITIONS CIWA -Ar - Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment Scale, Revised NICE DUTIES Medicines Management Committee Will app rove and review these guidelines Medical Director Is responsible for the dissemination of this guideline to their Clinical Directors and Clinical Tutors Clinical Directors Are responsible for the dissemination and implementation of the guideline in their service areas Heads of Service Are responsible for the dissemination and implementation of the guideline in their service areas Doctors Are responsible for reviewing the patient prescribing detoxification treatment and vitamin supplementation 4 Inpatient Nu rsing Staff Are responsible for monitoring CIWA -Ar scores and for signs of withdrawal Flow chart describing decision to commence medically assisted detox or not Patient admitted to the ward Planned admission for alcohol detox or due to an alcohol related problem where dependence is well established and the clini cal team is aware of the problem Admitted for some other reason and alcohol misuse is detected Does the patient have any withdrawal symptoms when they go without alcohol for longer than 6 -8 hours? (sweats, shaking, fluctuating temperature, raised BP and heart rate, nausea, vomiting / retching, anxiety, agita tion) in severe cases seizures or at the extreme Delirium Tremens) YES NO Detox is not indicated. Refer to drug service for ongoing support after discharge, consider relapse prevention if the patient craves alcohol but is not dependent - see appendix. If detox is contra - indicated refer back to drug service for advice around treatment options Has the patient had a detox within the last 6 months NO YES Balance risk of repeated detox against risk of continued drinking Does the patient plan to remain abstinent on discharge (unlikely if they were admitted for a non-alcohol related reason, or there is no evidence of engagement with a drug and alcohol agency prior to admission) NO Medically assisted detox if patient is: going to be admitted for 5 days or more, has withdrawal symptoms when they stop drinking and intends to maintain abstinence - see below for details Prescribe Chlordiazepoxide to prevent withdrawals if: patient is not going to maintain abstinence post detox, patient is not going to be admitted for 5 days or more or patient has had a detox within past 6 months and the risk of continued drinking does not outweigh risk of repeated detox - see below for details. Refer to drug and alcohol service post discharge YES 5 Steps in Medically Assisted Detox. Is medically assisted detox in dicated? If the patient has had a detox within the last 6 months . repeated detoxes are associated with an increase in the risks of complications developing - even if the patient is on medication. There is increased risk of seizures and delirium tremens occurring. this is part of the phenomenon known as Kindling Repeated detox is also associated with long term deficits in brain function. People who have had several medically assisted detoxes perform worse on cognitive tests . Assessment - Define the proble m. what were they drinking, how often, how much in 24 hours? What happen s when they do not drink for prolonged periods? Do they have withdrawals in the morning? If they do are they so bad they must drink first thing in the morning? To start prescribing we need to know the severity of dependence. We can get this from doing the severity of alcohol dependence questionnaire and also working out the number of units they drink per day or per week. The two should correlate so a dependent drinker would be expec ted to be drinking a high number of units of alcohol per day or week . The table below correlates SADQ score and alcohol unit consumption Severity of dependence Number of units per day SADQ score Chlordiazepoxide (initial starting dose) Moderate 15 - 30 15 - 30 15 - 30 mg qds Severe 30 - 40 31 - 45 30 - 40 mg qds Very severe > 40 > 45 > 40 mg qds See appendix for the SADQ and how to use it. The Detox - Detox should take between 5 to 10 days. Any less than 5 days and the risk period of developing compli cations has not been covered , thereby defeating the purpose of the detox. Any more than 10 days and there is a risk of developing a new dependence on chlordiazepoxide. Detox with chlordiazepoxide or diazepam (if a quicker onset is desired, but bear in mind diazepam is more likely to be abused). If there is liver impairment or in the elderly oxazepam is an alternative . Initially the dose will be four times a day and this will reduce over 5 to 10 days. The table below gives an example regime for a patient w ith moderate alcohol dependence Use the CIWA -ar score to guide the detox. The scale is done every day and gives a validated score of how severe the patients withdrawal is and is useful 6 to detect if the dose of chlordiazepoxide is high enough to cover the patient's withdrawal symptoms. If the CIWA -ar score is worsening, then the dose of chlordiazepoxide may need to be held or increased. Blood pressure pulse, temperature and respiratory rate should all be monitored regularly during detox. Medically assisted detoxes should be completed in 5 to 10 days. high risk period is the first 5 days so discharging before 5 days is dangerous as the patient could still develop severe withdrawal symptoms, even when detox is still happening. Detox is successful when patien t has no moderate or severe withdrawal symptoms when they have no medication or alcohol. Morning Midday Early Evening Bedtime Day 1 7 0mg 0mg 0mg 5mg Day 8 STOP A typical regime for moderate dependence, with an estimated average daily use of 20 units of alcohol, may require an initial d ose of chlordiazepoxide 20 mg QDS on day 1, with a gradual reduction over the next 5 to 7 days. A patient may stay on the same dose for a day or two depending on clinical need and therapeutic response. An additional small dose of chlordiazepoxide could be given in the first 48 hours if required. Doses in excess of 40 mg four ti mes a day should be prescribed only if there is clear evidence of very severe alcohol dependence. Such doses are rarely necessary in women and children and never in older people or if there is liver impairment. Seek advice from an addiction specialist in cases like this As the detox progresses the patient's observations should all improve. Often you will see improved gait and the patient is more steady on their feet. Patients requiring medically assisted detox should also be started on a course of Pabri nex at the thiamine deficiency prophylaxis dose - ampoule 1&2 once a day for 3 days. 7 Management during detoxification The following are to be monitored: Blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate every 6 hours for the first three days and then daily: Dia stolic blood pressure and/or heart rate above 100 may indicate the need to administer higher doses of benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms every 6 hours for the first 3 days, using the attached checklist (Appendix 1), if CIWA -AR scores remain below 8 at al l times. If CIWA -AR scores are above 8, further monitoring and further doses of chlordiazepoxide may be required. In case of over -sedation, the next dose of chlordiazepoxide may be missed and the regime needs to be reviewed. Random breathalyser and urine drug tests may be carried out at the discretion of nursing staff. Positive tests should be documented as this may result in the cessation of detoxification. Ward staff to liaise with the drug services when necessary. Avoid carbohydrate loads where possib le (e.g. IV Dextrose) in chronic alcohol use as this will deplete thiamine reserves and may precipitate Wernicke's encephalopathy. Always administer parenteral Pabrinex before administering glucose in all patients with altered mental state. Always conside r the risk of re -feeding syndrome and monitor appropriately. Carefully monitor for electrolyte imbalances and especially for sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate and magnesium levels. Consider an ECG and early referral to a medical ward when significant abnormalities are detected. In people with alcohol withdrawal seizures, consider offering a quick -acting benzodiazepine (such as lorazepam) to reduce the likelihood of further seizures. If alcohol withdrawal seizures develop in a person during treatment for acute alcohol withdrawal, review their withdrawal drug regimen. Those who have a seizure for the first time should be investigated to rule out an organic disease or structural lesion. Do not offer phenytoin to treat alcohol withdrawal seizures. Carb amazepine (inpatient setting only, see also SPC) may also be considered. Many mental health units use PR diazepam for emergency seizure control. Staff in an inpatient setting should be familiar with administration of rectal diazepam should a withdrawal s eizure occur. Rectal diazepam should be prescribed to be used PRN. Diazepam is also advocated as benzodiazepine of choice for medically assisted alcohol withdrawal in those with a previous history of seizures (Taylor et al. 2012). If delirium tremens de velops in a patient during treatment for acute alcohol withdrawal, review their withdrawal drug regimen. In people with delirium tremens, oral lorazepam should be offered as first line treatment. 8 If symptoms persist or oral medication is declined, consid er parenteral lorazepam, haloperidol or olanzapine and exclude comorbid acute medical conditions. Consider an antipsychotic (caution required due to lowering seizure threshold) in a patient with delirium who is distressed or considered a risk to themselv es or others and if verbal and non -verbal de -escalation techniques are ineffective. This should normally be for a short -term only (usually for 1 week or less). Use antipsychotic drugs with extreme caution or not at all for people with conditions such as P arkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The usual recommended starting dose for haloperidol in liver units, (i.e. in patients with underlying liver disease) is 1.5 - 2mg TDS, although treatment with benzodiazepines should be the priority. Patients suspected of having Delirium Tremens or Wernicke's should be transferred to an acute medical hospital. Mental Health wards do not have the facilities for administering IV fluids and these conditions are often associated with inter -current illnesse s such as electrolyte imbalances and infections. What to do if the patient is not suitable for medically assisted detox? If the patient is alcohol dependent but they are not suitable for a medically assisted detox (see flow chart above) the treatment will be about managing withdrawal symptoms. In this situation the SADQ is taken and the patient is given doses of chlordiazepoxide to prevent withdrawal while on the ward as an inpatient. The scenario here is that the patient is not going to be admitted for long enough to complete a detox, or a detox is contraindicated (for example they have recently had a detox and relapsed) or the patient is not in treatment with a drug and alcohol service so has done no preparatory work for abstinence and is unlikely to ma intain abstinence when they are discharged , or a frequent flier). They are given chlordiazepoxide at a dose high enough to prevent withdrawal. Doses are given up to four times a day. Doses are adjusted in line with the presence of withdrawal symptoms. If the patient is going to be kept in long enough to complete a detox they should be de toxed and plans put in place for them to be managed in the community . If they are not willing to engage with community drug services, then do not detox and manage withd rawal until they are discharged. The dose in withdrawal management would remain the same, it could reduce if they were an inpatient for a long time . Doses would be around 20mg to 30mg at a time. Higher if indicated by the SADQ score Withdrawal management should not continue for longer than 5 days. Vitamin supplementation On admission, all patients should preferably commence the following prophylactic treatment: 9 Pabrinex intramuscular injections one pair daily for 3 - 5 days followed by: Thiamine tablets100mg three times daily Vitamin B Compound Strong is no longer recommended. Pabrinex is also available as an Intravenous High Potency Injection. Therefore, before administration ensure that both the Summary of Product Characteristics and ampoule labels refer to the INTRAMUSCULAR injection. The contents of one ampoule number 1 and one ampoule number 2 of Pabrinex Intramuscular High Potency (total 7ml) are drawn up into a syringe to mix them just before use. Potentially serious allergic adverse re actions such as anaphylactic shock may occur rarely during, or shortly after, parenteral administration of Pabrinex Intramuscular, it is a very rare occurrence and should not preclude the use of Pabrinex Intramuscular in patients who need treatment by this route of administration . Initial warning signs of a reaction to Pabrinex Intramuscular are sneezing or mild asthma, and those treating patients need to note that the administration of further injections to such patients may give rise to anaphylactic shoc k. Facilities for treating anaphylactic reactions should be available whenever Pabrinex Intramuscular High Potency is administered. The patient's consent should be obtained before administration and they should be informed of the risk of anaphylaxis. The number of actual anaphylaxis incidents is low and has been quoted as 1 per 5 million with intramuscular injections. ( McIntosh et al 2005). Treatment for a presumptive diagnosis of Wernicke's consists of 2 -3 pairs of Pabrinex IV ampoules administered thr ee times a day for at least two days. Treatment may continue with 1 pair of Pabrinex IV ampoules for 3 -5 days or for as long as clinical improvement continues. This treatment should always be administered in a general hospital setting. Food supplements may be considered if dietary intake is inadequate, after advice from a dietitian. Use of Thiamine in Alcohol Harmful Use / Dependence (NICE -CG100/115) Prophylactic oral thiamine: if they are malnourished or at risk of malnourishment or if they have d ecompensated liver disease (development of jaundice, ascites, bruising or abnormal bleeding and/or hepatic encephalopathy) or if they are in acute withdrawal or before and during a planned medically 10 assisted alcohol withdrawal Prophylactic parenteral thiamine followed by oral thiamine: if they are malnourished or at risk of malnourishment or if they have decompensated liver disease and in addition they attend an emergency department or are admitted to hospital with an acute illness or injury Ther apeutic parenteral thiamine followed by oral thiamine: Offer to people with suspected Wernicke's encephalopathy. Maintain a high level of suspicion for the possibility of Wernicke's encephalopathy, particularly if the person is intoxicated. Parenteral tr eatment should be given for a minimum of 5 days, unless Wernicke's encephalopathy is excluded. Oral thiamine treatment should follow parenteral therapy. Wernicke - Korsakoff Syndrome The Wernicke -Korsakoff syndrome develops in problem drinkers who are thiamine deficient. However, other as yet unidentified factors must be important in its genesis as thiamine deficiency is not invariably associated with the development of this syndrome. Wernicke's encephalopathy comprises a triad of global confusion, e ye signs and ataxia; the confusional state is accompanied by apathy, disorientation and disturbed memory, but drowsiness and stupor are uncommon. The ocular abnormalities include nystagmus, gaze palsies and ophthalmoplegia, while the ataxia affects the tru nk and lower extremities. The clinical abnormalities may develop acutely or evolve over several days. Korsakoff's psychosis is an amnesic state in which there is profound impairment of both retrograde and anterograde memory but relative preservation of o ther intellectual abilities; confabulation may be a feature. Korsakoff's psychosis generally develops after an acute episode of Wernicke's encephalopathy. However, some patients develop a combined syndrome, from the outset, with memory loss, eye signs and unsteadiness but without confusion; others do not develop either the eye signs or ataxia. Post-mortem analysis has demonstrated that Wernicke's encephalopathy may occur in as many as 12.5% of chronic alcohol misusers. 11 The discrepancy between the pathol ogical findings and the clinical recognition of the syndrome may be explained by the fact that the classical presentation is seen in only 10% of patients. A presumptive diagnosis of the Wernicke -Korsakoff's syndrome should therefore be made in patients wi th a history of hazardous or harmful drinking and one or more of the following otherwise unexplained symptoms: ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, confusion, memory disturbance, comatose/unconscious, hypotension, and or hypothermia. Any patient presentin g with the above signs should be immediately transferred to the local General Hospital. Preventing relapse After a successful withdrawal of people with moderate and severe alcohol dependence, consider offering acamprosate, disulfiram or oral naltrexone i n combination with an individual psychological intervention (cognitive behavioural therapies, behavioural therapies or social network and environment -based therapies) focused specifically on alcohol misuse. Before starting treatment with acamprosate, oral naltrexone or disulfiram, conduct a comprehensive medical assessment (baseline urea and electrolytes and liver function tests including GGT). In particular, consider any contraindications or cautions (see the SPC), and discuss these with the service user. Acamprosate Acamprosate has been shown to increase abstinence rates. It should be initiated as soon as possible after abstinence has been achieved. Acamprosate should be avoided in severe hepatic impairment or in serum creatinine greater than 120 micro mol/litre. Relevant tests should be performed prior to initiation. Avoid in those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Refer to BNF/SPC for full details Acamprosate is usually prescribed at a dose of 1998mg (666mg three times a day) unless the service use r weighs less than 60 kg, and then a maximum of 1332mg should be prescribed per day (666mg in the morning and 333mg at midday and at night) . Acamprosate should usually be prescribed for up to 12 months, or longer for those benefiting from the drug who wan t to continue with it. It should be stopped if drinking persists for 4 -6 weeks whilst taking the medication. Service users taking acamprosate should stay under supervision, at least monthly, for 6 months, and at reduced but regular intervals if the drug is continued after 6 months. Do not use blood tests routinely, but consider them to monitor for recovery of liver function and as a motivational aid for service users to show improvement. 12 Naltrexone Naltrexone is a non -selective opioid antagonist, common ly used in opioid dependence post detoxification. It should not be started in patients known or suspected of being dependent on opioids including heroin, methadone or buprenorphine and analgesia such as codeine or other opioid containing agents. Naltrexone will precipitate acute withdrawal in these patients. Naltrexone is thought to reduce cravings for alcohol, reduce the number of drinking days and the amount of alcohol consumed. Begin treatment after assisted withdrawal. Start prescribing a t a dose of 25 mg per day and aim for a maintenance dose of 50 mg per day. Naltrexone should not be stopped if drinking resumes. Draw the service user's attention to the information card that is issued with oral naltrexone about its impact on opioid -base d analgesics. Informed consent should be obtained and documented for its use. Oral naltrexone should usually be prescribed for up to 6 months or longer for those benefiting from the drug who wish to continue with it. It should be stopped if drinking per sists 4 -6 weeks after starting the medication. Service users taking oral naltrexone should stay under supervision, at least monthly for 6 months and at reduced but regular intervals if the drug is continued after 6 months. Do not use blood tests routine ly, but consider them for older people, for people with obesity, for monitoring recovery of liver function and as a motivational aid for service users to show improvement. If the service user feels unwell , advise them to stop the oral naltrexone immediate ly. Disulfiram - used second line only after failed treatment on acamprosate and naltrexone . Initiated under specialist supervision Disulfiram inhibits the aldehyde dehydrogenase, leading to acetaldehyde accumulation after drinking alcohol which can cause unpleasant physical effects. Continued drinking can lead to arrhythmias, hypotension and collapse. Disulfiram appears to reduce the number of drinking days but not to increase abstinence. Supervised consumption may improve efficacy. Contra -indications f or using disulfiram include cardiac failure, coronary artery disease, and history of cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, psychosis, severe personality disorder and suicide risk. Disulfiram should not be continued for more than six months without a revi ew. Refer to BNF/SPC for full details. After a successful withdrawal for people with moderate and severe alcohol dependence, consider offering disulfiram in combination with a psychological intervention to service users who have a goal of abstinence but fo r whom 13 acamprosate and oral naltrexone are not suitable, or prefer disulfiram and understand the relative risks of taking the drug If using disulfiram, start treatment at least 24 hours after the last alcoholic drink consumed. Usually prescribe at a dose of 200 mg per day. For service users who continue to drink, if a dose of 200 mg (taken regularly for at least 1 week) does not cause a sufficiently unpleasant reaction to deter drinking, consider increasing the dose in consultation with the service user. Before starting treatment with disulfiram, test liver function, urea and electrolytes to assess for liver or renal impairment. Check the SPC for warnings and contraindications in pregnancy. Make sure that service users taking disulfiram stay under superv ision, at least every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, then monthly for the following 4 months. If possible, they should have a family member or carer, who is properly informed about the use of disulfiram, to oversee the administration of the drug. Servic e users on disulfiram should be medically monitored at least every 6 months after the initial 6 months of treatment and monitoring. Warn service users taking disulfiram, and their families and carers, about: The interaction between disulfiram and alcohol (which may also be found in food, perfume, mouthwash etc.), the symptoms of which may include flushing, nausea, palpitations and, more seriously, arrhythmias, hypotension and collapse. The rapid and unpredictable onset of the rare complication of hepatoto xicity; advise service users that if they feel unwell or develop a fever or jaundice that they should stop taking disulfiram and seek urgent medical attention. Discharge from hospital Alcohol detoxification regime should have been completed. A week's supp ly of acamprosate, naltrexone or disulfiram, if prescribed, could be issued from pharmacy. Vitamin supplementation should be reviewed and continued as deemed appropriate. GPs may prescribe oral thiamine 50 mg per day (as a single dose) during the mainten ance stage following withdrawal, and for as long as malnutrition may be present. If the person has chronic alcohol dependence, oral thiamine may need to be continued indefinitely. Referral to the local Drug and Alcohol services for follow up is a priorit y. Post - discharge support could be initiated during the in -patient stay if required and available locally. 14 REFERENCES AND BIBLIOGRAPHY Mayo -Smith M (1997) Pharmacological management of alcohol withdrawal Journal of the American Medical Association 278: 1 44-151 Lingford -Hughes A R, Welch S, Nutt DJ (2004) Evidence -based guidelines for the pharmacological management of substance misuse, addiction and comorbidity: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology Journal of Psychopharmacol ogy; 18(3): Sykora K Schneiderman J, Naranjo CA Sellers EM (1989) Assessment of alcohol withdrawal: the revised clinical institute withdrawal assessment for alcohol scale (CIWA -Ar)' British Journal of Addiction ;84(11): 1353 -1357.

Diagnosis assessment and management of harmful drinking and alcohol dependence Clinical Guideline 115 London: NICE Available from http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG115 15 APPENDIX 1 16 The CIWA -Ar is a validated tool to assess the severity of withdrawal during detoxification. It can be used as a guide to the administration o f 'PRN' or 'as required ' chlordiazepoxide and 17 to alert clinicians to problems . It is not a substitute for clinical judgement but a guide to inform clinical decisions. It is recommended that a baseline CIWA -Ar score is obtained prior to initiating chlordi azepoxide. The initial CIWA -Ar score should be used in conjunction with the severity of 'Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire' (SADQ) which provides a guide to the regime of chlordiazepoxide required, according to the severity of dependency . Further, CIWA -Ar scores should be obtained one hour after receiving each dose of chlordiazepoxide until 2 consecutive scores of 8 or less are obtained. The following guidelines highlight the relationship between CIWA -Ar and requirement for 'PRN' chlordiazepoxide. CIWA-Ar Score AND SEVERITY OF ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL ACTION REQUIRED (IF MEDICATION IS GIVEN REPEAT CIWA -Ar IN ONE HOUR) 0-8 (mild) None 8-10 (mild) None. If hallucinations or of up to three \"prn\" doses can be given. Call doctor if CIWA -Ar remains above 10 >20 (severe) 20 mg chlordiazepoxide. Call doctor. May require treatment in general medical ward No additio nal intervention is required for a CIWA -Ar score of eight or less For scores of between eight and ten when the patient is Not experiencing hallucinations or disorientation, no action is required. For scores between eight and ten in the presence of hall ucinations or disorientation, 10mg of chlordiazepoxide should be given and the score checked again after one hour. If the score is between ten and fifteen, 10mg chlordiazepoxide should be given and the score repeated in an hour If the score is between sixteen and twenty, give 20mg chlordiazepoxide and recheck the score in an hour. Up to three doses of chlordiazepoxide can be given at hourly intervals if necessary. However, if after the third dose the score remains above ten, seek medical advice if thi s has not already been done. Scores of twenty or more indicate severe alcohol withdrawal and a risk of Delirium Tremens and seizures. 20mg chlordiazepoxide should be administered and a doctor called. The patient is likely to need be seen to re -assess t he diagnosis and may need to be treated in a general medical ward. The CIWA -Ar score should be repeated after an hour. If the score 18 remains above ten, it is mandatory for a doctor to see the patient if this has not already happened. The objective is to obtain two consecutive scores of eight or less. This indicates safe withdrawal. If a total of 20mg or more chlordiazepoxide has been given as \"PRN\" doses in any one day, the regular regime of chlordiazepoxide will need to be re -written starting at a lighter dose to prevent re -emergence of symptoms of alcohol withdrawal to the large drop in the daily dose of benzodiazepine which would otherwise occur. The CIWA -Ar is used to assess the severity of withdrawal during the detox. It can be used to guide doses and to alert clinicians to problems. Again experienced clinicians will be able to cover its domains in interview and will not feel they need the CIWA -Ar. However, many more complex regimes found in many prescribing guidelines rely on the CIWA -Ar sc ores to guide dosing. 19 APPENDIX 2: AUDIT Questionnaire This is one unit of alcohol... ...and each of these is more than one unit AUDIT - C Questions Scoring system Your score 0 1 2 3 4 How often do you have a drink containing alc ohol?

It is a measure of the severity of depe ndence. The AUDIT questionnaire, by contrast, is used to assess whether or not there is a problem with dependence. The SADQ questions cover the following aspects of dependency syndrome: physical withdrawal symptoms affective withdrawal symptoms relief drinking frequency of alcohol consumption speed of onset of withdrawal symptoms. Scoring Answers to each question are rated on a four -point scale: Almost never - 0 Sometimes - 1 Often - 2 Nearly always - 3 A score of 31 or higher indicates \" severe alcohol dependence\". A score of 16 -30 indicates \"moderate dependence\" A score of below 16 usually indicates only a mild physical dependency. A chlordiazepoxide detoxification regime is usually indicated for someone who scores 16 or over. It is ess ential to take account of the amount of alcohol that the patient reports drinking prior to admission as well as the result of the SADQ. There is no correlation between the SADQ and such parameters as the MCV or GGT. 25 APPENDIX 4: DOSING REGIMENS alcohol services in Areas covered by East London Foundation Trust Bedford and Dunsta ble - Path 2 Recovery (part of ELFT) - "}
