What's it Like? The Science of Scientific Analogies by Chris Edwards To fully understand the significance of the argument made by Douglas Hofstadter and Emmanuel Sander in their new book [Surfaces and Essences: Analogy as the Fuel and Fire of Thinking](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465018475/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0465018475&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20), one must first be familiar with the fence (not a wall) separating mathematics and science from the humanities. Physicists, for example, are trained to see mathematics as the only \"real\" way of understanding scientific phenomena. Many great physicists explain their concepts to lay audiences using metaphors and analogies, but often regard this process as sharing Platonic shadows with those who could not comprehend the ideal. As a brief aside into the history of analogical thinking in philosophy will show, a good many serious thinkers have been widening the holes in this fence for a while now, but Hofstadter and Sander not only want to tear the fence down, but seek to have the humanities annex mathematics entirely. Central to their argument is that even Einstein's insights came to him primarily in the form of analogy, and while the authors answer no significant philosophical or theoretical questions, their argument does open up new pathways for approaching these questions. [1](#note01) As is often the case in philosophy, this analogical approach has intellectual ancestors. Perhaps the first statement involving the concept can be attributed to the Enlightenment philosopher Joshua Reynolds, who in 1776 wrote: This search and study of the history of the mind, ought not to be confined to one art only. It is by the analogy that one art bears to another, that many things are ascertained, which either were but faintly seen, or, perhaps, would not have been discovered at all, if the inventor had not received the first hints from the practices of a sister art on a similar occasion. [2] The counterintuitive idea here is that if a thinker wants to advance in an academic field, then she should study widely outside the field in search of analogies that can then be superimposed on problems from the original field. Here Reynolds is identifying the centrality of analogical thinking for the sciences. Although Ludwig Wittgenstein's famously impenetrable 1921 Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, continues to spark controversy\u2014largely because of its vagueness\u2014modern forays into epistemology rescue the core of Wittgenstein's philosophy. He wrote, for example: [3](#note03) - 2.063 The total reality is the world - 2.1 We make to ourselves pictures of facts - 2.11 The picture presents the facts in logical space, the existence and nonexistence of atomic facts. - 2.12 The picture is a model of reality - 2.13 To the objects correspond in the picture the elements of the picture. - 2.131 The elements of the picture stand, in the picture, for the objects - 2.14 The picture is a fact. - 2.15 That the elements of the picture are combined with one another in a definite way, represents that the things are so combined with one another. This connexion of the elements of the picture is called its structure, and the possibility of this structure is called the form of representation of the picture. - 2.151 The form of representation is the possibility that the things are combined with one another as are the elements of the picture. - 2.1211 The pictures is linked with reality; it reaches up to it. - 2.1512 It is like a scale applied to reality. In the above passage, Wittgenstein presages Leonard Mlodinow and Stephen Hawking's theoretical position of Model-Dependent Realism (MDR) by noting that the mind makes models based upon \"atomic facts.\" [4](#note04) Wittgenstein does not deign to explain his concepts and phrases, but by putting his words into a philosophical context, we may infer that \"atomic facts\" refers to the way that objects are perceived by human senses. Wittgenstein's assumption, then, is that the model of reality constructed by the mind acts in accordance with the \"atomic\" reality. Using analogical language, he compares the mind model to reality, saying our mind models of the \"atomic facts\" are, in fact, like a scale model. Much of his argument relies on simple faith. In fact, evolutionary biology likely gives us a representative model of the universe which is grounded in \"atomic\" reality, simply because it is difficult to see how a radically counterintuitive mind model would be useful for helping an organism survive or mate. In 1980, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson published the importantly insightful work [Metaphors We Live By](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009KA3Y6I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B009KA3Y6I&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20), in which they explained how metaphorical thinking, such as \"time is money,\" lies at the heart of language and of thought. [5](#note05) People tend to think through analogies and metaphors, and therefore the unattended mind can get caught in false metaphors. Prior to that, in his 1962 book [The Structure of Scientific Revolutions](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226458121/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0226458121&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20), Thomas Kuhn, while avoiding the language of metaphors and analogies, coined the word paradigm to describe the totality of the scientific understanding of the universe at any given time. [6](#note06) Kuhn theorized that paradigms often face crisis from new facts which, to borrow the language of Lakoff and Johnson, would threaten the existing set of metaphors and analogies. The problem, from the point of view of physicists, is that the notion that analogy or metaphors might get thinkers closer to an understanding of how the universe functions than mathematics makes the scientific endeavor seem a little too much like, well, like the humanities. Hofstadter and Sander argue against this concept repeatedly in the book and are quite right to note that mathematicians and physicists are reluctant to stray from their numbers into the murky waters of epistemology or metaphysics. A quote from the eminent physicist Leonard Susskind, in his book about his disagreement with Stephen Hawking over black holes, summarizes the attitude of most physicists. Susskind wrote that, after having finished Thomas Kuhn's classic work that the ideas of the book sparked his thinking prior to a lecture he gave in Santa Barbara in 1993: I would have liked to add some philosophical remarks about how evolution has created a mental picture that guides our actions when it comes to caves, tents, houses, and doors, but that it misleads when it comes to black holes and horizons. Yet those remarks would have been ignored. Physicists want facts, equations, and data\u2014not philosophy and evolutionary pop psychology. [7] Susskind's disdain is an echo of Richard Feynman's famous put down that the philosophy of science is about as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds. Yet, Edward O. Wilson, one of the most prolific and influential scientists of the last half century, recently has written that mathematics really is not all that crucial for science. In a Wall Street Journal opinion editorial, Wilson wrote that most mathematical theorems are actually translations from already existing scientific theories. Charles Darwin, according to Wilson, bordered on mathematical illiteracy. When Both Hofstadter and Wilson argue that mathematical thinking is secondary to analogical thinking, both philosophers and mathematicians should pay attention. [8](#note08) Furthermore, many serious physicists have started to recognize the importance of epistemology, especially when it comes to the search for the mirage of a \"Theory of Everything\" which would unify classical and quantum mechanics. In his 1995 book [Schr\u00f6dinger's Kittens and the Search for Reality](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316328197/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316328197&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20), John Gribbin attacked the concept of the \"Theory of Everything\" as a myth: [If] scientific knowledge really is a product of culture then scientific communities that exist in different worlds...would regard different natural phenomena as important, and would explain those phenomena in different theoretical ways (using different analogies). The theories from different scientific communities\u2014the different worlds\u2014could not be tested against one another, and would be, in philosopher's jargon, \"incommensurable.\" [9] Here, Gribbin united an epistemological position from the humanities with hard science, and later in his book he compared mathematics with language. (Mathematics represents a rich language indeed). Once one accepts the analogy of mathematics and language, the next step is simply to note that languages cannot be right or wrong but more or less descriptive, and the same is true of mathematical theorems and scientific theories. In his 2010 book [A Tear at the Edge of Creation](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1611683971/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1611683971&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20), the astrophysicist Marcelo Gleiser, also critiqued the search for TOE: There is no final \"right to be arrived at, only a sequence of improved descriptions of the cosmos. Each era, each generation even, will describe the Universe in ways that may be radically different from the preceding one. [10] A few months after that book's publication, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow published [The Grand ( [Order the lecture](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/av223)), and echoed Gleiser and Gribbin while giving this theoretical position a title: According to model-dependent realism, it is pointless to ask whether a model is real, only whether it agrees with observation. If there are two models that both agree with observation... then one cannot say that one is more real than another. One can use whichever model is more convenient in the situation under consideration.... [11] So why is this new book by Hofstadter and Sander even necessary if the concepts they wrote about seem so well-developed by other thinkers? Is there anything new here? Yes. Hofstadter and Sander go further in their arguments than any previous physicist or philosopher by claiming that all thinking, from the superficial to the most profound, is based upon analogy. The authors devote an entire chapter called \"Analogies that Shook the World\" to arguing that Einstein's insights into physics were, in fact, the elaborate creation of abstract analogies. This argument is fascinating, because it represents a total annexation of mathematics by the humanities. They write: To some people, it might seem far-fetched to imagine that any role at all might be played by analogical thinking in the professional activity of a mathematician. After all, of all intellectual domains, mathematics is generally thought of as the one where rigor and logic reach their apogee. A mathematical paper can seem like an invincible fortress with ramparts built from sheer logic, and if it gives that impression it is not accident, because that is how most mathematicians wish to present themselves. The standard idea is that in mathematics, there is less place for intuitions, presentiments, vague resemblances, and imprecise instincts than in any other discipline. And yet this is just a prejudice, no more valid for mathematics than for any other human activity. [12] Or, as Gribbin wrote earlier and more succinctly, \"[T]he discovery that mathematics is a good language for describing the Universe is about as significant as the discovery that English is a good language for writing plays in.\" [13](#note13) The conceit that Hofstadter and Sander put forth here is not necessarily new for those interested in the history and philosophy of science, but the authors further the argument to a greater degree than anyone before by claiming that Einstein thought primarily through analogy. The authors turn Einstein\u2014typically seen as a logical and mathematical genius\u2014into an exemplar for thinking analogically. For mathematicians this is not quite, perhaps, the equivalent of arguing that Jesus was a Hindu, but it's not far from it. To use but one example of the authors' argument, Einstein found an analogy between light and electromagnetic radiation. They wrote: \"Although not in the least controversial today, Einstein's bold suggestion in 1905 that light must consist of particles was harshly and unanimously dismissed by his colleagues. Later in life, he declared this hypothesis, based upon the shakiest of analogies, to be the most daring of his entire career.\" [14](#note14) The rest of the argument about Einstein is deeply thought out and, ultimately convincing. It does seem, however, that the authors stopped short of spelling out the implications and applications of their thesis. In other words, for those of us who buy their argument, what does this all mean? Applications For and Problems with the Analogical Approach The universe sometimes presents us with areas of time or space that defy explanation\u2014mathematical, analogical, or otherwise\u2014these are called singularities. Philosophy, also, has its singularities such as the mystery of consciousness. The reason these singularities defy explanation for so long is that certain phenomena don't act like anything we come into contact with in our everyday lives. Analogies tend to evolve slowly and often in tandem with technology. Galileo understood planetary motion only after new cannon technology helped to evolve mathematical techniques to explain how airborne spheres move in relation to gravity. Newton developed a theory of a clockwork universe only after the clock proliferated. When Leonard Susskind theorizes about a holographic universe, he falls into storied tradition of using technological analogies as explanatory tools. Douglas Hofstadter has devoted much of his philosophical career to exploring the nooks and crannies of physics and philosophy while looking for connections or analogies that might be applied to deep questions. His thinking seems to be that abstract phenomena will require abstract analogies in order to be understood. For example, in his book [I Am a Strange Loop](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465030793/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0465030793&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20) he seemed to argue (readers of Hofstadter must sift through a lot of sand to get the gold) that consciousness can be understood as through the analogy of an information loop. In Surfaces and Essences, Hofstadter and Sander argued that all thinking is analogical and that na\u00efve analogies poison a lot of thoughts. The authors stated that when schoolchildren are taught to view division as sharing rather than as measurement, they make it harder for students to complete more complex mathematics later on. The ability to create proper analogies is therefore central to higher thought. The authors wrote: To choose one analogy over another is to favor one viewpoint over another. It amounts to looking at things from a particular angle, to taking a specific perspective on a situation. An insightful analogical take on a situation gives you confidence in your beliefs about the situation while also revealing new facts about it. A teacher, a lecturer, a lawyer, a politician, a writer, a poet, a translator, or a lover may pass hours or days in search of the most convincing analogy.... [15] Before going any further, it's important to note that the authors developed a philosophy of analogical thinking that is deeper than a glib \"this is like that\" type that most of us associate with the concept. The philosophy, which Hofstadter and Sander argue is central to mathematics, is that analogies reach greater levels of abstraction (at some level, the ideas become difficult to convert into ordinary language). One must think about this abstraction until it becomes solid, and then look to find points of connections between complex analogies in other fields. They wrote that \"In short, the secret of making good analogies involves making good but more abstract analogies\u2014analogies between encodings, or conceptual skeletons.\" [16](#note16) Now, Hofstadter and Sander note in their book that people can only make analogies based upon what they know. Individuals who have not studied deeply in a topic can only understand the topic through superficial analogies that lead to incomplete thoughts. (I found myself wondering how many economic policies are driven by the na\u00efve analogy that the government's budget is like a household budget.) Bear in mind that someone could, if she wanted, make a decent explanation to a six-year old of how photosynthesis works using boxes of apple juice. The six year old might think it pretty cool that apple juice boxes and photosynthesis are closely related, but then would be disappointed later by how arbitrary and incomplete this analogy is. Hofstadter and Sander further argue that, historically, only in cases where a thinker became obsessed with a topic did it become possible for that person to see the deep analogies in that area. When dealing with abstract questions, one might expect to find the best analogies in other areas of abstraction. This is where the Hofstadter and Sander make a crucial point: A passion for horses or dogs does not instantly turn these animals into sources for analogies that yield insights into triangle geometry, quilt design, fly-fishing, or who knows what else. On the other hand, a double obsession could surely give rise to such analogies. That is, a simultaneous fanatic for, say, Euclidean geometry and for fly-fishing would doubtless find plenty of phenomena in these two domains on which to found analogies, for in this case the search would be intense on both sides. [17] And here we have returned to the concept first stated in 1776 by Joshua Reynolds. An analogical approach would require thinkers to study deeply in several fields, looking for connections between, and analogies from, each field for application to abstract problems. The future of philosophy, and the future of thought, belongs as it always has, to those individuals who can think deeply in various disciplines. This has already begun. Werner R. Lowenstein's 2013 [Physics in Mind: A Quantum View of the Brain](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465029841/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0465029841&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20), represents just such an attempt to use insights from quantum physics to explain consciousness. (He never mentions Hawking and Mlodinow's Model Dependent Realism, but spells out the logic of the position.) Lowenstein aptly describes the actual physical makeup of the senses from the cellular level, but then explains the problem of consciousness in language very similar to the way in which Hawking has presented the mathematical issues surrounding the Big Bang, but then issues a call of a dual-field approach to the problem: Regarding the nature of the very foundation of mind, consciousness, we know as much as the Romans did: nothing. We don't even have a valid paradigm. Painful as it is, I say this at the start, so as not to raise false hopes (there has been enough of that in recent years). But it would be unfair to lay all of the blame at the door of biologist. The gap of knowledge, as I see it, falls as much into the field of physics as it does in that of biology. Consciousness provides a natural meeting ground for biologists and physicists\u2014it is the ultimate frontier. [18] The problem with this notion of studying in abstract fields for abstract analogies reveals itself immediately. Can we really expect anyone to become deeply informed in both biology and quantum physics? It takes half a lifetime of study to really understand many of the concepts inherent in each field. Even if we did produce these types of thinkers, then how exactly are we to find a community of similar scholars who could peer-review the work? And where would this type of work be published? Furthermore, Hofstadter and Sander point out that most analogies are false matches. Someone could spend a lifetime searching for analogies in metaphors from multiple fields but not find anything necessarily meaningful. Or, even worse, someone studying in fields far separate from their own risks becoming a dilettante and creating na\u00efve analogies that might actually do intellectual damage. And it would require someone else to follow in the same steps across multiple fields to check or correct the theory. One point upon which the authors breeze by too quickly involves the lessons that can be learned from historical geniuses. The authors state that creating a work of genius is not a deliberate process but something that comes as a natural result of an obsession with problems in multiple fields. Historically, this is true, however as I've argued in my work on educational theory, there's no reason to leave this process up to serendipity. Why not capture this historical force and put it to work as an educational philosophy? The authors do not call for this, but perhaps a new approach is needed in higher education. Why not make the process of analogy hunting a new field of knowledge in itself? Would any modern university president be bold enough to introduce a Department of Consilience and Analogy? Hofstadter and Sander make a convincing argument, but nothing in the book indicates that they fully understood the implications of what they've done to science, or in particular, to Einstein's theories. Their intent appears to have been to show the centrality of analogical thinking even to one of history's greatest geniuses based upon the assumption that Einstein intuited great truths. Yet, the full implications of their argument would alter our perception of what Einstein did. Follow me here; if Einstein thought analogically by equating mass with energy and gravity with acceleration, and most importantly, space with time, then his set of analogies are just that\u2014analogies that are applicable to real world phenomena. Einstein famously conjectured that the speed of light is the universe's only constant, but he merely pulled this from his own formidable mind. We might note that if Einstein had begun by conjecturing that the speed of sound was the universe's only constant he could have made a descriptive theory with all of the same elements. Only it would have described every particle and wave that moved more slowly than sound. His genius was to begin with the fastest speed that anyone knew about, maybe the fastest speed we can know about, and then created a theory that described all the particles we come into contact with. Now, physicists assume that certain rules hold true for different levels of phenomena. To borrow the language of Hofstadter and Sander, a physicist who throws a pebble into a mud puddle can, based upon that analogy, extrapolate those same forces outward to calculate what would happen if a meteor struck the Atlantic Ocean. The same forces apply only to greater degrees. The same is true of slingshots and rocket ships. Yet, it could be that at the particle level our analogies of propulsion, derived from the Newtonian level, do not hold up. Our confusions about the consciousness, the big bang, and other singularities all stem from the fact that there is nothing in our experience that provides an adequate analogy for understanding. If this was the case, Einstein's brilliant theory would hold true for everything in the universe except for things travelling faster than what his theory forbids. If faster than light particles are ever conclusively found, then we will have found out that Einstein's genius was in the creation of a brilliant theoretical model, but not in the intuition of a universal truth. It could simply be that at certain speeds the analogies about propulsion that we derive from engines or muscles simply do not apply any longer. While the ideas that Hofstadter and Sander put forth may sound abstract, in his book Loewenstein says that 30 percent of the U.S. Gross National Product is now based upon quantum physics, something which just a century ago existed only in the minds of a few obscure thinkers and in the largely unopened pages of a handful of academic journals. Furthermore, the uncovering of potentially apt analogies to consciousness might yield new insights that could have benefits we cannot currently conceive of. It's not too far-fetched to imagine that someone well-trained in lattice theory might be able to understand the way in which neurons are packed into the brain better than a neuroscientist who lacked such insights. An epistemological understanding that encouraged thinkers to be polymaths and analogy hunters could be as useful as anything since the development of quantum theory. Information is now readily available, but the human mind must be able to make sense of that information for it to be coherent and useable, and this can only be done through minds that are educated to think in a certain way. Hofstadter and Sander, by annexing all fields of knowledge under the banner of analogies, have presented philosophers and scientists with a challenge that carries deep implications of change for each field of knowledge. After finishing the book, this reader is left with the impression that we still have the same old problems but perhaps we have a new way forward.

The Spark and the Hype by Chris Edwards Kristine Barnett's son Jacob is autistic and he has become really good at mathematics at an early age. This much appears to be true, and it is not necessarily out of the ordinary for autistic savants, many of whom develop early propensities for unique skill sets involving numbers and music. But Jacob's mother, who has published a book called [The Spark: A Mother's Story of Nurturing Genius](https://www.amazon.com/The-Spark-Mothers-Nurturing-Genius/dp/0812993373/&tag=skepticcom20-20) (Random House, 2013) fails to provide any solid evidence that Jacob is anything more than a typical autistic savant (defined as someone with autism who also has a special skill set). [1](#note01) The hype around Jacob\u2014that he has created an original theory in astrophysics worthy of the Nobel Prize, that his IQ is higher than Einstein's, and that his genius can only be nurtured in a university environment despite his young age\u2014dissipates upon skeptical inquiry. Furthermore, the media attention surrounding Jacob reveals that many in the public still falsely view intelligence\u2014and especially \"genius\"\u2014as an inborn trait rather than as the product of intense intellectual effort. It's best to begin by systematically examining the remarkable claims that Jacob's mother (and her publisher) makes about her son in her book. To begin, the book jacket flap claims: \"At nine [Jacob] started working on an original theory in astrophysics that experts believe may someday put him in line for a Nobel Prize.\" Kristine repeats that claim in the introduction by stating that, at age nine, \"[Jacob] began work on an original theory in the field of relativity. The equations were so long they spilled over from his gigantic whiteboard onto the windows of our home. Uncertain how to help, I asked Jake if there was someone he might show his work to, and a renowned physicist I contacted on Jake's behalf generously agreed to review an early iteration. He confirmed that Jake was indeed working on an original theory and also said that if the theory held, it would put him in line for a Nobel Prize.\" [2](#note02) Kristine repeats this later in the book, after she's identified the renowned physicist as Dr. Scott Tremaine, a professor at Princeton. She writes \"Dr. Tremaine got back in touch. He had taken a look at Jake's equation, and he sent Jake an email with a list of books.... But he also wrote me an email. In it, he confirmed that Jake was indeed working on an original theory, and he made it clear that if Jake's theory held, it would put him in line for a Nobel Prize.\" [3](#note03) Before revealing what Dr. Tremaine really wrote, it's worth taking a moment to focus on that \"s\" that pluralizes the word \"expert\" on the book flap. Nowhere in the book or in any media coverage does anyone indicate that more than one expert looked at Jacob's theory. A niggling point, perhaps, but not insignificant as scientific journals require peer review from a number of experts, and giving the impression that several people have confirmed the validity of a theory when they have not is not quite honest. Kristine's claims about Dr. Tremain's reaction to Jacob's theory are, at best, a misrepresentation. A March 20, 2011 article in the Indianapolis Star includes a partial text of Dr. Tremaine's email: \"I'm impressed by [Jacob's] interest in physics and the amount that he has learned so far. The theory that he's working on involves several of the toughest problems in astrophysics and theoretical physics. Anyone who solves these will be in line for a Nobel Prize.\" Clearly this is a statement about the significance of the problems that had sparked Jacob's interests, not a commentary on the theory itself. Nowhere does Dr. Tremaine suggest that Jacob's theory actually solves any problems. Besides, any student of the history of physics knows that predicting Nobel Prize winners is an iffy prospect at best, and that physics prizes tend to go not to theoretical constructs but research discoveries. Let's not buy Jacob a ticket to Stockholm just yet. In fact, when the reporter who wrote the article followed up with Dr. Tremaine, the professor stated only \"I have seen a YouTube video in which Jake describes his theory, and I have spoken with his mother and corresponded with both her and Jake by email. I hope that Jake continues his interest in physics and mathematics.\" This is hardly a solid validation of Jacob's theory and it's interesting to note that while Kristine liberally quotes from the conversations she has with professors and experts throughout the book, the actual text of the email she received from Dr. Tremaine does not appear in The Spark. The second remarkable claim about Jacob involves the mystifying notion that Jacob's IQ is higher than Einstein's. This claim appears nowhere in the text of the book but is the first thing mentioned on the book flap, and appears in many of the media articles about Jacob. In fact, one can also find this claim made about an Indian 12 year-old named Neha Ramu and a handful of other preteens. [4](#note04) It's not clear where the claim comes from since Einstein never actually took an IQ exam. For some reason, it is assumed his IQ would have been around 160 but it's not clear where that number comes from or what criteria or measure would be used to calculate a number. Let's test the notion that Einstein must have had an exceptionally high IQ due to his historical work in physics. We do have IQ information on another of the 20th century's titans of physics, that of Richard Feynman. In his biography of the man James Gleick writes that Feynman's \"score on the school IQ test was merely a respectable 125.\" [5](#note05) MENSA requires a score of 132 to enter, which means that even those sub-geniuses who miss the cut off for entry by six points can still console themselves with the idea that they have a higher IQ than Richard Feynman! Okay, here's the baffling thing. Kristine writes that \"Jake had scored 170 on the Wechsler Fundamentals: Academic Skills achievement test, which measures broad skills in reading, spelling, and math. The normal range is between 90 and 109, superior between 110 and 124, and gifted between 125 and 130. Scores about 150 fall into the category of genius.\" [6](#note06) The Wechsler test, typically, is given to kids between the ages of 6 and 16. What does it mean to say that Jacob, or any other kid, has an IQ higher than Einstein on an intelligence test meant for children and adolescents? Does this mean that we assume that a 10-year old Einstein would have scored 160 on the test or are we assuming that a 30 year old Einstein would score a 160 on the test? How exactly can we compare anybody's results on an IQ test with Einstein's when the man never had his IQ tested? Can I also assume that his SAT score would be 1000, and then assume that I scored \"better than Einstein\" on the exam? Thirdly, much of the narrative in The Spark involves Kristine trying to find an academic place for her autistic son and, finding public schools inadequate, has to locate a place for him at the local college campus. At this point, I should disclose that I teach Advanced Placement World History at a high school not far from where Jacob now attends university in central Indiana. The Indianapolis area provides ample opportunities for gifted students to engage in mathematics competitions. It is a bit curious that Jacob does not attend these events, especially given that he would likely find intellectual comrades there. Kristine writes that she did not want Jacob in the math club because it would take up all of their Saturday mornings. She writes that after her first trip to a math team practice, that \"Five hours later, I realized that this math club would mean that Jake would have to give up every Saturday to sit in a stuffy basement classroom with a bunch of kids doing math.\" Because of this, she kept Jacob out of competitions. Then she indicates that Jacob's intelligence would have made his entry into competition unfair, by writing \"He'd found a sample Mathematical Olympiad problem set online the night before and had stayed up until two in the morning blowing through it for fun. It hadn't been a challenge for him, and he didn't want to take a win away from any of the kids who'd been studying so hard to get into the competition. 'They're all trying really hard, Mom. It's not fair'.\" [7](#note07) Being a teacher, I see how hard our math competitors work, and how impressive their achievements can be in competition, but I suspect there's probably something else going on here, not to mention that this attitude is more than a little condescending. Speaking of this, most of Kristine's narrative involves her trying to find an academic environment where Jacob's needs could be met. She meets this laudable goal when a Dr. Russell at Indiana University/Purdue University Indianapolis requested that Jacob join a collegiate program called \"Special Programs for Academic Nurturing\" or SPAN. [8](#note08) Kristine asks rhetorically, \"Would we consider pulling Jake out of elementary school and sending him to college?\" [9](#note09) The image of an elementary aged child in a college course has done much to enhance Jacob's mystique, but is it really that big of a deal? Anyone with a student in a modern high school, for example, knows that almost all secondary schools in the suburbs are high school/college hybrids. I myself teach an Advanced Placement World History course to mostly high school freshman, which is a college class where students can earn college credits if they score well on a federal exam. The class is harder than anything I took even in graduate school (the notion that university programs provided greater rigor than high school has recently been debunked by an important book called [Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses](https://www.amazon.com/Academically-Adrift-Limited-Learning-Campuses/dp/0226028569/&tag=skepticcom20-20)) and a few years ago a student took the course and got the highest possible score on the exam at the age of 12. [10](#note10) Nobody called the newspapers. In addition, I frequently act as a faculty advisor for students in the International Baccalaureate program. In order to graduate, students have to produce an original piece of work similar to the type of work that Jacob likely engages in as a \"paid researcher\" for IUPUI, another of the claims lauded on the book flap. My point is that this type of work is hardly out of the ordinary for \"regular\" high school students in advanced programs. The Amadeus Myth I'm a teacher and the father of two young sons. While neither of my children has any developmental issues, brain cancer nearly killed my youngest boy and only relented after a succession of surgeries and radiation treatments (he's now two years in remission.) I sympathize with Kristine and know the gut-wrenching feeling that comes with worrying about the fate of your children. In addition, it is clear that young people need to be lauded more for intellectual accomplishments (as opposed to athletic), and I do wish it was the case that math prodigies and scientists received more public recognition. But the attention heaped on Jacob Barnett, because it feeds into media-generated myths about genius, may do more harm than good. In his analysis of genius in [The Borderlands of Science](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b069PB), Michael Shermer calls the Amadeus Myth\" and defines it as \"the belief that genius and original creations are produced by mysterious mental miracles limited to a special few. Its source is ancient, dating back to the ancient Greeks who believed that the Muses, or gods, breathed creativity into certain individuals.\" [11](#note11) The prime example of a child touched by the spark of the muses is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Dr. Shermer exposes this story as a myth. Two new misconceptions seem to be currently tied in with the Amadeus Myth. The first is that a high IQ equates with genius. I sometimes tell my Ivy League bound students to not make the mistake of having gone to school without having done a great thing. The same principle applies for the concept of IQ. Having a high IQ might indicate that someone is more likely to create a work of genius, but it does not define someone as a genius. Compare Richard Feynman, with his 125 IQ who created works of genius that earned him the Nobel Prize, with Marilyn vos Savant, the woman who famously has the world's highest IQ, and whose major intellectual contributions is writing an \"Ask Marilyn\" column in the Parade magazine insert that comes with the Sunday paper. Who did work worthy of genius? Perhaps because higher level mathematics remains incomprehensible to most people, there is a tendency to ascribe genius to individuals who can work at deep levels of mathematical theory. But does mathematics really deserve such a lofty place in the intellectual Valhalla? No less an intellect than Edward O. Wilson recently argued most mathematical theorems are actually translations from already existing scientific and philosophical theories. [12](#note12) Einstein thought in pictures and metaphors, for example, then translated those concepts into mathematics. With a slew of talented science writers currently churning out books written in plain language, people with poor math understanding are hardly barred from the world of theoretical physics or biology. In his article, Dr. Wilson noted that Charles Darwin, for example, was more or less inept at math. Jacob's mathematical skills are no doubt impressive, but his skill set is more akin to playing a violin at the top level than it is to creating a work of genius. Violin players learn to carefully play already existing pieces. Kristine seems to understand that a new theory is necessary to confirm Jacob's \"genius,\" hence the hype over his supposedly original theory. But that theory has not been put through the rigor of peer review and, therefore, does not yet count. In public perception, high IQ plus mysterious mathematical talents plus the image of a young person at the university plus very spurious claims about a potentially Nobel Prize winning original theory all feed into the preexisting Amadeus myth. This helps to explain the media's interest in Jacob. Add to this Jacob's autism, and the controversies surrounding that topic, and you have a marketing phenom. What we don't have is a body of work to judge. You see, to be a genius is to produce a work of genius. Genius is as genius does. In his book of biographies about geniuses, Harold Bloom describes his test for genius by asking \"has my awareness been intensified, my consciousness widened and clarified? If not, then I have encountered talent, not genius.\" [13](#note13) Works of genius in the sciences are defined by one's peers. Take the example of the modern genius Grigory Perelman, a Russian mathematician who proved the Poincare Conjecture in the year 2000. Masha Gessen, who wrote a book called [Perfect Rigor: A Genius + The Mathematical Breakthrough of the Century](https://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Rigor-Mathematical-Breakthrough-Century/dp/015101406X/&tag=skepticcom20-20) about Perelman details many features of the man that parallel Jacob. [14](#note14) Perelman, for example, was both a math prodigy and almost certainly is autistic. But Perelman never shied from mathematics competition as a youngster. And he spent eight or nine years, as an adult, in relative isolation to create his work of genius. When Perelman finished his work; he was nearly 40 years of age and then he presented his original theory to a community of experts and traveled to the United States in order to explain himself. People in his field reviewed Perelman's life work with rigor, declared it valid, and he was offered a million dollar reward for his efforts. (Perelman declined to collect the money.) Even with a mathematical gift, it took half a lifetime of effort for Dr. Perelman to create a work of genius. Terms like \"original theory,\" \"genius\" and \"Nobel Prize\" should not be flippantly thrown around, and I'm not sure had Dr. Perelman been lauded as a teenager for his early achievements that he would have had the fortitude to overcome the many obstacles he needed to create his impressive work. In my own book on education\u2014 [Teaching Genius: Redefining Education with Lessons from Science and Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com/Teaching-Genius-Redefining-Education-Philosophy/dp/1610488164/&tag=skepticcom20-20)\u2014I intended to demystify the concept of genius and to try and find lessons from great thinkers that can be applied in the classroom. [15](#note15) As Grigory Perelman's example indicates, and as Michael Shermer and others have written, works of genius are the products of thousands of hours of study and intellectual work. Kristine Barnett and her publisher have taken an autistic boy with a talent for mathematics and, by misrepresenting the emailed words of a single physicist, by comparing Jacob's IQ to Einstein's non-existent score, and by overstating the importance of his placement at a university, have hyped him into a genius. Real genius requires thousands of hours of potentially fruitless effort. Then the product of such efforts must be put through rigorous peer review and exposure in the marketplace of ideas. Let's hope that the hype surrounding Jacob doesn't suck the air away from his spark. Let us also hope that that the misconceptions expounded by his example do not smother the sparks of others.

About this week's eSkeptic In this week's eSkeptic, we Brillig... column from [Skeptic magazine 18.2](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol18n02.html) (2013) in which he discusses the detection of deception using the infamous polygraph \"lie detector.\" A Skeptic in Court, Part II by James Randi To those of us who first come upon it, the classic gypsy bazhure swindle is so simple, obvious, and avoidable, that we can't imagine how victims are so easily taken in by it. Consider this very common advertisement: Reads cards, reads palms, performs cleansings, interprets dreams, reunites loved ones, sexual deficiencies, cures nervous disorders, employment problems, alcoholism and drug addiction. Don't suffer anymore. If you can't have children, call me. Performs spells, counterspells and love spells. Okay, that's obvious woo-woo, we'd all agree, but look a bit further. Some of these victims had had Tarot card readings with Monica (the psychic described in my previous column in Skeptic magazine 18.1) and as a result agreed to have her cleanse their money. All of them had set up a final meeting that Sunday night, at which they expected they would retrieve their cleansed money and would of course pay a gratuity for that service\u2014whatever they felt was appropriate\u2014to Se\u00f1ora Monica. But, to their genuine surprise, Se\u00f1ora Monica never showed up! What I've described to you is\u2014as I wrote previously\u2014a typical example of the classic gypsy bazhure (pronounced \"bah-zhoor,\" as in \"azure\") in which the \"mark\" is lured in by such minor gimmicks as Tarot readings, which is a bit of fun for a few bucks, perhaps followed by a \"gift\" of herbs or charms. Then the victim is offered the suggestion that maybe some of the money in the bank might be contaminated by a curse\u2014unknown to the victim, of course\u2014and that \"cleansing\" that currency would be advisable. The cost would be a percentage decided upon by the victims\u2014excuse me\u2014patrons. The fact that the original \"cursed\" currency had long ago vanished into the banking system, and might by then be in the pockets of gangsters, or could have been incinerated and replaced, or buried, seemingly doesn't occur to the patrons. But enough on how gullible these families were. Now let's try to understand this from the proper point of view. They may have been na\u00efve, but were not necessarily stupid. I say \"to their genuine surprise,\" because they were governed by their strong ethnic convictions, ideas conveyed to them from infancy by those they loved and trusted, who nurtured and raised them to accept and believe that magic was a part of the real world, and that certain \"gifted\" persons could manipulate those forces. Here is a typical example: In August of 2009, police in Lakewood, WA, were searching for a woman who had promised to \"cleanse\" the money of at least seven Hispanic families in the area, but stole it instead. Well, consider: a sizeable portion of our population regularly receives a wafer-and-wine combination, while on their knees, from a man wearing a dress, and they actually believe that the bit of food they've consumed has been magically transformed into flesh and blood. I'll go no further on that, but it is a firm, unshakeable conviction of those on their knees, regardless of the alibis and rationalizations that have been offered to explain their delusion. A far less numerous crowd believes that spirits and fairies inhabit trees and rocks, another portion accepts that mankind was deposited on Earth\u2014and into volcanoes! \u2014by intergalactic warlords, and some are convinced that taking zero concentrations of medications is better than taking the actual medicine. Some folks\u2014not I\u2014have no problem with these latter fantasies, but cannot fathom why an un-named woman would have been able to make off with the life savings of these families.... Try to understand, please. I have consistently declined to participate in any court case or investigation where I would be required to accept evidence obtained with the polygraph. However, if I were to be called upon to deny that this silly device is effective or dependable, I'd have no hesitation in doing so. The evidence is just so much against this technology, it's difficult to believe just how long it has existed as a supposedly valid notion. Let's look at some of the history of so-called \"lie detection.\" The device itself is a nightmare of tubes, wires, electrodes, and moving styluses, something right out of a Loony Tunes production. By measuring and displaying changes in respiration, heart rate, blood pressure, skin conductivity, and other variables of the human body, a complex series of graph-lines are generated, and a technician is supposedly able to decide whether the answers to a set of questions are honestly given, or not. We need not get into more involved aspects of the procedure such as who comes up with the questions to be asked\u2014though that is a matter of primary importance, of course. Let's examine opinions of the \"pros\" who should know. On his Pentagon letterhead as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence, this November 5, 2002, memorandum was sent by John P. Stenbit to the directors and administrators of all major military offices of the Department of Defense: SUBJECT: Continued Use of Polygraph Techniques I have recently reviewed the report of the National Research Council on the existing scientific evidence on the validity of the polygraph technique. While the report contained many findings that may ultimately lead to improved methods for the detection of deception, I think it is important to emphasize that the National Research Council found that none of the potential new technologies for the detection of deception showed any promise of supplanting the polygraph technique for screening purposes in the near term. I believe this could have included Tarot cards and Ouija boards, as well, and made just as much sense. Note that it doesn't say that the polygraph works, at all! The truth is that it's a useless hitech assemblage that has consistently failed double-blind tests of its efficacy. The way this paragraph was composed, there is a strong suggestion that the flummery actually has performed as claimed. This next paragraph is even worse, further implying that the polygraph works: As the Department continues to research alternative technologies in this critical area, I believe it is important to remember that the National Research Council Report determined that the polygraph technique is the best tool currently available to detect deception. Next, Secretary Stenbit labeled the polygraph an \"important tool\"\u2014twice! \u2014when it's useless, according to research done at the National Academy of Sciences\u2014see below. This is simply a blatant denial of fact to bolster an erroneous opinion! In the coming months, our country will face many unique challenges to our national security. The polygraph technique remains an important tool to detect deception in selected national security and law enforcement matters. Where appropriate and authorized, I recommend that we continue to use the polygraph technique as an important tool in our total decision-making process. Late in 2002, the U.S. National Research Council\u2014a branch of the National Academy of Sciences\u2014issued their official report on the use of the polygraph. As we've seen, Mr. Stenbit chose to completely ignore this report's key finding that the use of polygraph screening was found to be unjustified\u2014 and thus even dangerous\u2014to national security. Nor did the NRC/NAS report characterize polygraphy as \"the best tool currently available to detect deception,\" as Mr. Stenbit erroneously asserted. The report merely noted that ...some potential alternatives to the polygraph show promise, but none has yet been shown to outperform the polygraph. Since the polygraph works about as well as the Oracle at Delphi\u2014another shaky premise, though much older\u2014this is not at all supportive. Regarding polygraph technology in general, the NRC/NAS stated that ...there is essentially no evidence on the incremental validity of polygraph testing, that is, its ability to add predictive value to that which can be achieved by other methods. Let's examine the realities, folks. A CBS News account of the suicide bombing at a CIA base in Afghanistan stated, regarding the careless acceptance of a spy on the base: The double agent was brought onto the base without first being given a polygraph test, one of the basic tools in establishing a spy's trustworthiness. Wrong. The polygraph does not work. The history of this farce is long and involved, with uninformed \"experts\" raving about success, and law enforcement agencies smugly accepting results as if they were valid. In addition to the Afghanistan case above, some very strong examples of this error stand out: Use of the polygraph did not expose the fact that Larry Wu-Tai Chin, a Chinese language translator working for the CIA in a critical capacity, was selling crucial information to China. Robert Hanssen of the FBI went similarly undetected despite the regular periodic \"screening\" of FBI employees using polygraphs. Aldrich Ames, a highranking CIA analyst, routinely passed polygraph exams, though for years he was a master Soviet spy who passed information to his real employers. The blatant fact is that not a single spy has ever been caught by a polygraph screening exam. In 2003, the National Academy of Science issued a report titled, \"The Polygraph and Lie Detection,\" that found the majority of polygraph research to be, in their words, \"unreliable, unscientific, and biased.\" They also found the high rate of false positives obtained with the device, to be unacceptable. No, folks, the polygraph is a highly undependable device, made even more dangerous because of the incompetence of the small army of \"experts\" who are able to find just about any conclusion required.

Reality Check SKEPTICALITY EPISODE 214 This week on Skepticality, Derek presents another interview conducted at The Amazing Meeting 2013. In Las Vegas, he sat down with Dr. Donald Prothero to discuss another of his books which was recently released, [Reality Check: How Science Deniers Threaten Our Future](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b151HB). Find out why Dr. Prothero has dedicated so much of his time attempting to ensure the public becomes more scientifically literate, and what he fears will happen if they don't. About this week's eSkeptic In this week's eSkeptic, Donald R. Prothero Cowperthwaite's film [Blackfish](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/blackfish/id678359648?at=10l6ex) (Magnolia Pictures, 2013), about Tilikum \u2014 a killer whale in captivity at SeaWorld responsible for the deaths of several people. [Read Prothero's full bio after the article](#Prothero). Free Tilly! by Donald R. Prothero Every year, millions of people visit marine theme parks, especially those run by the giant SeaWorld Corporation, including three in the U.S. in San Diego, San Antonio, and Orlando. They spend hundreds of millions of dollars not only in admissions and rides, but also food, merchandise, parking and many other expenses. My own family used to have an annual pass to SeaWorld San Diego, because we visited so frequently. The centerpiece of each visit was the killer whale (or orca) show, where \"Shamu\" (a role played by many different whales) goes through its tricks, splashes the audience, and astonishes us with its apparent \"tameness\" despite their scary size. But after watching Blackfish, I can no longer stand to go there. I cannot imagine watching the killer whale show ever again. Blackfish is a gripping documentary film that follows a series of recent events concerning the abuse of orcas in captivity, especially as they have long been used in shows. First released at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2013, since July it has gone into wider release in large cities with movie houses that specialize in indie, foreign, and documentary films. It has received universal rave reviews, and [rated a 98% \"Fresh\" ranking on the RottenTomatoes.com](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blackfish_2013/) movie site. Unlike some expos\u00e9s, this movie (\"blackfish\" is the name that First Nations people gave to orcas) obtained an incredible amount of information and access, and interviews nearly all the people close to the story (including a number of former SeaWorld trainers who quit when they could no longer live with themselves). Through the details provided by these many trainers and other witnesses, the film shows in gut-wrenching and painful detail how inhumane it is to keep a huge marine predator that is adapted to large complex social groups, and capable of swimming in packs hundreds of miles each day, and confining them for decades among other hostile whales in something that feels like a bathtub. The movie begins with a teaser about the tragic death of senior SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau on February 24, 2010, when she was performing with a 12,000-pound, 23-foot-long bull orca named Tilikum (\"Tilly\" to the trainers). It then jumps back in time to 1983, interviewing the man who captured Tilikum by tearing him away from his mother as a young calf in Iceland, killing many other whales in the pod, and covering up the crime. The film then traces Tilikum's history: first, in a poorly run facility called SeaLand in Victoria, B.C. where he was brutalized by the older whales, confined to a very small pool, and eventually killed a trainer. When that incident caused SeaLand to close in 1992, Tilikum was sold to SeaWorld, where he became the star of the Orlando park. None of the staff knew of Tilikum's traumatized past or his previous killing, and he became a regular in more and more shows as trainers took greater and greater risks. Yet the film documents many close calls where trainers nearly died, but the incidents were all covered up. In 1999, Tilikum killed a man who had hid after park closing, and apparently tried to get too close to the whale during the night (he was allegedly not detected, even though they have security cameras everywhere). His body was found naked and maimed, floating atop Tilikum, the next morning. Interspersed with the story of Tilikum are interesting interviews with marine biologists about orcas in the wild, describing their incredibly complex social structure, with a wide range of vocalizations that can be rightfully called \"different languages.\" Again and again, the movie demonstrates not only how intelligent these creatures are, but also how they are tightly bonded to their family units in the pod. The offspring never leave their mothers for their entire lives\u2014unless death or a marine park separates them. Although SeaWorld is the primary focus of the story, the film takes a brief tour to another similar park in the Canary Islands west of Spain, where a marine park abused its animals, and eventually an orca killed a trainer. The film then concludes with the details of the death of Dawn Brancheau, and shows that Tilikum without provocation suddenly dragged her to her death, and then ate her. (You see a lot of gut-wrenching footage, but no actual killings or maimings). This incident led to an OSHA investigation, with SeaWorld trying to escape liability by blaming it on \"trainer error\", even though the video footage of the incident, the eyewitnesses, and the trainers who knew her, clearly demonstrate that she did nothing wrong. OSHA ruled against SeaWorld, and concluded that orcas were too dangerous to be handled this way. SeaWorld employees now must keep barriers between themselves and the whales at all times, and no longer enter the water with them. But there is a much larger issue here. At one time, we thought of orcas as frightening, terrible \"killer whales\" and they were the subject of numerous low-budget exploitation films. Now we understand that they are as intelligent, or more intelligent, than any other wild animal, with complex social behaviors and tight mother-offspring bonds\u2014yet we treat them as \"dumb fish\" to be cooped up in tiny pools, and moved around from park to park, disrupting their family bonds that are seldom broken in the wild. Clearly, it makes no sense to put humans in harm's way, because these creatures are always \"wild animals\" that could turn on you and kill you in a few seconds. (Just ask Siegfried and Roy). But the film makes it clear that keeping them in these inhumane conditions is incredibly cruel and traumatic for them, and there is no real justification for it. They are not threatened in the wild, so (unlike some endangered animals in zoos) the marine parks are not protecting them from extinction. Nor does the \"educational value\" of letting a few people see them close-up justify the inhumanity of their confinement for decades. Some would argue that SeaWorld could build them bigger pools to swim in, although this is ludicrous when you realize they swim hundreds of miles a day in the wild. And what has SeaWorld been building instead? Roller coasters! So why does SeaWorld do it, and why did they try to blame the victim whenever tragedy occurs? As you might expect, it's all about money. Not only are the orca shows the biggest draws in SeaWorld (generating revenue not only with their shows, but especially with all the merchandise), but Tilikum in particular is valuable as a stud. His sperm is worth thousands of dollars, and consequently he is the father of a large number of the whales currently in the collections. (We even get to see how they stimulate the semen out of a bull orca in graphic detail). Clearly, SeaWorld views the orca show as critical to their entire business model. No wonder they refused to cooperate with the filmmakers. When they did respond to the film shortly before its release, their [PR statement mostly misrepresented what the film actually says](http://www.indiewire.com/article/seaworld-unleashes-8-assertions-about-blackfish-and-filmmakers-respond), or repeated the false claim that Dawn Brancheau was to blame for having a ponytail that the whale could grab (clearly debunked by the actual video footage). Corporations clearly want to protect themselves, but you emerge from the film disgusted with SeaWorld's well-documented pattern of covering up dozens of dangerous incidents and close calls, and trying to play down or cover up the deaths that Tilikum alone caused\u2014or blame the victim after she is dead and cannot defend herself. The ancient Romans enjoyed brutality, watching gladiators fight to death in their arenas, and lions eat Christians. Animals of every kind were forced to fight and kill each other\u2014all for entertainment. A few centuries ago, bear baiting was considered fun and acceptable as a sport. Bull fighting, dog fighting, and cock fighting are still found around the world, although they are illegal in most of the developed countries. We look on these practices and cannot imagine how people could derive enjoyment out of such horrendous treatment of animals. Perhaps some day soon, we'll look back and have the same attitude toward depriving and torturing orcas, and keeping them in prison for our own enjoyment as well. After all, most research on chimps is over or nearly phased out. Sometimes we do make progress. About the Author DR. DONALD R.

About this week's eSkeptic In this week's eSkeptic, George Michael reviews Mary Roach's book, [Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AR2BCLW/&tag=skepticcom20-20) (W.W. Norton & Company, 2013, ISBN: 0393068471). George Michael received his Ph.D. from George Mason University's School of Public Policy. He is an associate professor of criminal justice at Westfield State University in Massachusetts. Previously, he was an associate professor of nuclear counter-proliferation and deterrence theory at the Air War College in Montgomery, Alabama. He is a veteran of both the U.S. Air Force and the Pennsylvania Air National Guard. He is the author of five books, including The Enemy of My Enemy: The Alarming Convergence of Militant Islam and the Extreme Right, Willis Carto and the American Far Right, and most recently, Lone Wolf Terror and the Rise of Leaderless Resistance which was published by Vanderbilt University Press in 2012. In addition, his articles have been published in numerous academic journals. Martian Chronicles a book review by George Michael To date, the Space Age reached its apogee on July 20, 1969, when the Apollo 11 crew landed on the moon. Mars seemed to be the next logical destination, but the age of exploration quickly gave rise to the age of experimentation as both the U.S. and Russian space programs focused on low-orbit missions and stints on space stations. But, new hope for reaching Mars came last year, when Dutch entrepreneur Bas Lansdorp announced his intention to establish a human colony in 2023. According to the plan, the intrepid pioneers will fly on a one-way trip to Mars where they will begin building a permanent settlement. Every two years, a new set of four astronauts would join them. Funding would come in part from a global reality television program in which candidates for the expedition would be selected. In [Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AR2BCLW/&tag=skepticcom20-20), Mary Roach, a journalist with unusual research interests (death, corpses and the afterlife, the science of sex, how food is digested, etc.), takes a close look at the challenges facing those spacefarers headed to the red planet. As Roach notes, humans are difficult and expensive to send into space. Therefore, the first spacefarers were not humans, but test animals. She recounts the vital role that animal subjects played in the early space program. For the early flights, piloting duties were light to nonexistent. Inasmuch as the first space capsules were more akin to bullets than rockets, nonhumans were good candidates for these missions. Whereas the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched monkeys and chimpanzees on its rockets insofar as primates were physiologically similar to humans, the Soviet program preferred to send dogs into space, believing that canines were less excitable. A dog named Laika became the first living creature to orbit the Earth, but alas, there was no plan or means to bring her safely back home. The first of the great apes to be launched into outer space\u2014Ham the Astrochimp\u2014was more fortunate. Upon his successful return to Earth, he was feted as a national hero, appearing on the cover of Life magazine in his flight suit. Some of his fans even sent their copies of Life with requests for Ham's \"autograph,\" which consisted of an ink print of his hand. On a practical level, his lever-pushing performance demonstrated that such tasks could be carried out in space. In order to beat the Soviets to the Moon, NASA once considered sending a chimp on a one-way mission; however, even if successful, the agency would have had to deal with the public relations fiasco of a dead chimpanzee hero. The first human astronauts were chosen for their \"right stuff,\" viz., their temerity and charisma. From the earliest days of the space program, the astronauts were looked upon as exemplars of their respective societies. Assumed to be rugged individualists, the early astronauts could not depend on anyone but themselves and a small crew. But in the contemporary Space Age, crews are larger and more diverse and missions are longer. This has changed the group dynamics on board spaceflights. As Roach explains, what was the \"right stuff\" for the Mercury era could now very well be the \"wrong stuff\" for long duration missions. Increasingly, astronauts have to be persons who play well with others. In the early years of spaceflight, the most pressing issues concerned life support, the human-machine interface, and the optimization of human performance to ensure mission success. But gradually over the years, a shift from a purely \"displays and knobs\" orientation to a more holistic approach, which involved project managers, engineers, and behavioral researchers, began to take hold. As more and more doctors, biologists, and engineers are among the ranks of the spacefarers, Roach opines that \"astronauts these days are as likely to be nerds as heroes.\" Or...the heroes are the nerds. The early space psychologists did not worry much about astronauts getting along with each other on flights insofar as their missions lasted only a few hours, or at most, a few days. Furthermore, the first astronauts flew solo. The overriding concern at the time was what effect the silent, black vacuum of space would have on the spacefarers. Claustrophobia and solitude were the two most salient conditions on the minds of space psychologists. But there were salutogenic (enhancing mental and physical wellbeing) effects as well. Some astronauts felt the experience in space euphoric, commenting that they felt nearer to God. NASA was concerned not so much about euphoria itself, but whether this elation could overtake good sense. On a long mission to a distant destination it could be difficult to anticipate how much astronauts will miss the world when they are deprived of it for an extended period of time. The \"Earth-out-of-view\" problem could arise with astronauts on a trip to Mars, in which the home planet will be reduced to an insignificant-looking dot in space. There is concern that NASA, which has historically downplayed psychological problems, is unlikely to spend much time and resources to investigate those issues. Although access to psychologists is available during missions, crewmembers are usually reluctant to make use of it. Astronauts are understandably fearful that even the slightest sign of a psychological malady will disqualify them from flying. This reluctance is dangerous because if someone on a spacecraft is reaching the breaking point it is important for ground control to know about it. The faintest possibility that a space mission would be compromised by psychological factors could be a public relations disaster for NASA. To get a better understanding of the rigors of space travel, Roach visited numerous simulation and test sites. At the Mars Surface Simulator\u2014Mars 500\u2014located at the Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow, she interviewed scientists who examined the psychological effects on subjects living in an isolated, confined environment with no privacy. On board NASA's C-9 plane, she experienced weightlessness during a parabolic flight. To gain a better understanding of the long-term effects of living in zero gravity on the human body, she talked to scientists and subjects at a NASA-funded bed-rest study at the Flight Analogs Research Unit at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. She visited a crash test lab at the Transportation Research Center in Ohio where NASA conducts experiments on cadavers to test the effect of severe g-forces on humans. To prepare for another mission to the moon, NASA uses the HMP (Haughton-Mars Project) at Devon Island in Canada. Granted access to the site, Roach had the chance to observe the Small Pressurized Rover\u2014an orange Humvee\u2014traverse the craterous terrain that resembles the moon. As Roach points out, everything we take for granted on Earth must be rethought, relearned, and rehearsed when venturing into space. Inasmuch as humans have evolved for life on Earth, they are not accustomed to living in space. Initially, weightlessness can be an exhilarating experience; however, the novelty quickly wears off and floating astronauts soon dream of walking. Astronauts often experience motion sickness which can lead to vomiting\u2014a problematical situation in a gravity-free environment. In fact, NASA space helmets are built with air channels that directly flow down over the face at six cubic feet per minute so that vomit will blow down away from the face and into the body of the suit. Living in a near-zero gravity situation for a protracted period can have serious health consequences. Currently, the practical limit on weightlessness has been about six months. Weightlessness effects circulation resulting in increased blood volume in the upper half of the body, which also happens to be the place where the body's blood sensors are located. When astronauts are in space, the sensors misinterpret this effect as a surplus of blood, which causes the body to reduce its production. As a result, astronauts in space make do with 10 to 15 percent less blood than they do on Earth. The most serious consequence of weightlessness, though, is that bones thin and muscles atrophy. Although muscle mass is regained in a matter of weeks, bones take three to six months to recover. In fact, some studies suggest that the skeletons of astronauts of long duration missions never quite recover. According to the research of Dennis Carter of Stanford University, astronauts on a two-year mission to Mars could expect to eventually lose from one-third to one-half of their bone mass in their lower bodies\u2014a situation not unlike a paraplegic. An astronaut returning from a mission to Mars could very well risk snapping a bone when stepping out of the capsule into Earth's gravity. Not only must astronauts acclimate to weightlessness, they must also deal with high g-forces of acceleration during launch and deceleration during reentry. Provisioning space crews has always been challenging. The first space food was not unlike baby food; astronauts had to suck their meals out of tubes. Carbonated drinks are not feasible in space because the bubbles don't rise to the surface; instead, there is only a foamy froth. In recent years, the quality of the space food has improved as meals no longer have to be compressed or dehydrated. Maintaining good body hygiene is difficult in space. Showers are unavailable; instead, astronauts wipe themselves with moistened towels and rinseless shampoo. Although clothes are normally good absorbers of sebum (the oil produced by glands) and sweat, when astronauts are unable to change garments for long durations, the garments begin to decompose. Excretion can be difficult because in a weightless environment, fecal material never becomes heavy enough to break away and drop down on its own. For long duration missions, sexual concerns will become more pronounced. Some space managers have even recommended that a Mars crew should be composed of couples in order to ease the tension that could build up during a long mission. There is much uncertainty how traveling in space would influence conception and pregnancy. What biological perils could await an embryo conceived in space? Beyond the protection of the Earth's atmosphere, cosmic and solar radiation levels rise significantly. Dividing cells are extremely sensitive to radiation, which could increase the risk of mutation and miscarriage. Sending humans to Mars is an enormously expensive proposition. For space engineers, sending robots seems more practical than sending humans as the former requires no water, oxygen, or food supply. Moreover, there is no need to worry about interpersonal issues that might arise with a human crew. In recent missions, robotic probes have demonstrated great potential. In August of 2012, an automated motor vehicle\u2014the Curiosity rover\u2014began exploring and conducting experiments on the Gale Crater on Mars and sending back exciting results. As Roach points out, however, robotic landers do not capture the public's imagination in the same way as real flesh-and-lood astronauts. What is more, humans possess intuition, a trait that has yet to be duplicated in artificial intelligence. Humans can draw upon a vast catalogue of experiences that they have accumulated over a lifetime in order to make quick decisions. Without the public's interest and support, it is all the more difficult for NASA to secure funding. In short, for NASA there will be \"no bucks without Buck Rogers.\" To Roach, the tough question is not so much \"Is Mars possible?\" but \"Is Mars worth it?\" A mission to Mars, she avers, would be the ultimate reality TV. While conceding that the money on such a mission could be better spent on Earth, she counters \"But would it?\" Since government funds are often squandered, she reasons, why not squander some more on Mars? But with an estimated price tag of anywhere between a 100 billion to a trillion dollars, this proposition would seemingly be a hard sell in an increasingly tight fiscal environment. Nevertheless, according to a recent poll, 75 percent of those Americans surveyed agreed that NASA's budget should be substantially increased in order to fund this endeavor. (Jason Koebler, \" [Poll: Americans Overwhelmingly Support Manned Mars Mission](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/02/11/poll-americans-overwhelmingly-support-manned-mars-mission),\" U.S. News and World Report, February 11, 2013.) Perhaps we will soon have the scientific capabilities, public support, and political will for the next major achievement of the Space Age.

Now call it all by the simple name \"Something.\" Why is there \"Something\" rather than \"Nothing\"? Is not Nothing, no world, simpler and easier than any world; is it not so that Nothing would have been the least arbitrary and \"most natural\" state of affairs? In this week's eSkeptic, Robert Lawrence Kuhn explores the essence of Nothing, or what he calls \"Levels of Nothing.\" This article appeared in [Skeptic magazine issue 18.2](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol18n02.html) (2013). Levels of Nothing There Are Multiple Answers to the Question of Why the Universe Exists by Robert Lawrence Kuhn Nothing, of late, is something of a scandal. Physicists and philosophers debate the efficacy of quantum physics, and the value of philosophical analysis, to explain why there is Something rather than Nothing. [1](note01) In [Skeptic magazine Vol. 13 No. 2](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol13n02.html) (2007), I confronted my life-long obsession with Nothing. Entitled \" [Why This Universe: Toward a Taxonomy of Ultimate Explanations](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/downloads/skeptic13-2_Kuhn.pdf),\" the article described my existential angst and offered some 27 possible \"ultimate explanations.\" I suggested that while \"Why Not Nothing?\" may seem impenetrable, \"Why This Universe?\", energized by remarkable advances in cosmology, may be accessible. While they are not at all the same question, perhaps if we can begin to decipher the latter, we can begin to decrypt the former. After the article was published, Skeptic editor Michael Shermer encouraged me to expand the article into a book. I approached the philosopher John Leslie, who for decades had focused on Something/Nothing and whom I had come to know through our discussions on Closer To Truth, the PBS television series that I created and host, and we set about to co-edit a book of readings and commentaries on the ultimate question. [The Mystery of Existence: Why is there Anything At All?](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470673559/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0470673559&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20) (Wiley-Blackwell, 2013), long in gestation, presents the ideas of contemporary thinkers as well as some others throughout intellectual history, grouped under five possible \"solutions\" to the \"Why-is-there- Something-rather-than-Nothing?\" puzzle: - a blank is absurd; - no explanation needed; - chance; - value/perfection as ultimate; and - mind/consciousness as ultimate. In this article I shall explore the essence of Nothing, or what I call \"Levels of Nothing,\" especially in light of recent debates and public interest. [2](note02) Why \"Levels\" of Nothing? That's where the confusion lies. What is it About Nothing? Lump together everything that exists and might exist\u2014physical, mental, platonic, spiritual, God, other nonphysicals. As for the physical, include all matter, energy, space and time, and all the laws and principles that govern them (known and unknown); as for the mental, imagine all kinds of consciousness and awareness (known and unknown); as for the platonic, gather all forms of abstract objects (numbers, logic, forms, propositions, possibilities\u2014 known and unknown); as for the spiritual and God, embrace anything that could possibly fit these nonphysical categories (if anything does); and as for \"other nonphysicals,\" well, I just want to be sure not to leave anything unclassified. Lump together literally everything contained in ultimate reality. Now call it all by the simple name \"Something.\" Why is there \"Something\" rather than \"Nothing\"? Why Not Nothing? What guides me here is gut feeling, not clever reasoning, which is why no argument has ever dissuaded me from continuing to think, following Leibniz, [3](note03) that Nothing, no world, would be simpler and easier than any world, that Nothing would have been the least arbitrary and \"most natural\" state of affairs. As I have continued to think about Nothing, I have continued to think that Nothing \"should,\" in some sense, have obtained, and the only reason I accept the fact that Nothing does not obtain is not because of any of the arguments against Nothing, [4](note04) but because of the raw existence of Something\u2014because in my private consciousness I am forced to recognize that real existents compose Something. In other words, an a priori weighing of Nothing v. Something (from a timeless, explanatorily earlier perspective) would, for me, tip the balance heavily to Nothing, but for the fact of the matter. Thus, since I have no choice but to recognize that there is Something, I have no choice but to conclude that there is foundational force, selector, productive principle or type of necessity\u2014some deep reason\u2014that brings about the absence of Nothing. I cannot rid myself of the conviction that Nothing would have obtained had not something special somehow superseded or counteracted it. Yes, I know that seems circular\u2014and many well-regarded philosophers say, \"So there's a world not a blank; what's in any way surprising about that?\" But I just can't help feeling that they are passing right over the problem most probative of ultimate reality. Levels of Nothing Defining \"Nothing\" may seem simple\u2014no thing, not a thing. But what's a \"thing\"? I invoke the term \"thing\" in the most general possible way, and therefore, given some possible notions of Nothing, it is no contradiction to find \"things\" that compose these different kinds or levels of Nothing. Teasing apart these constituent things, as if scaffolds or sinews of Nothings, may help enrich understanding of the nature of Nothing, yielding a taxonomy that arrays opposing kinds of Nothing that could be conceived and might have existed. This taxonomy is structured as a deconstruction or as a dissection, as it were, a reverse layering, a peeling, a progressive reduction of the content of each Nothing in a hierarchy of Nothings. As such, this taxonomy takes its heritage from the so-called Subtraction Argument, which seeks to show that the absence of all concrete objects would be metaphysically possible. (Stated simply, the Subtraction Argument works by imagining a sequence of possible worlds each containing one less concrete object than the world before, so that in the very last world even the very last object has vanished. It is no surprise that complexities emerge. [5](note05)) Developing this way of thinking, there might be nine levels of Nothing, with a general progression from Nothing most simplistic (Nothing One) to Nothing most absolute (Nothing Nine). There are criticisms of each of these Nothings. My point here is not so much to argue the legitimacy of any one kind of Nothing but rather to construct an exhaustive taxonomy of all potential or competing Nothings, and perhaps a taxonomy in which those Nothings are mutually exclusive. Following are nine levels of Nothings. - Nothing as existing space and time that just happens to be totally empty of all visible objects (particles and energy are permitted)\u2014an utterly simplistic, pre-scientific view. - Nothing as existing space and time that just happens to be totally empty of all matter (no particles, but energy is permitted\u2014flouting the law of mass-energy equivalence). - Nothing as existing space and time that just happens to be totally empty of all matter and energy. [6](note06) - Nothing as existing space and time that is by necessity\u2014 irremediably and permanently in all directions, temporal as well as spatial\u2014totally empty of all matter and energy. - Nothing of the kind found in some theoretical formulations by physicists, where, although space-time (unified) as well as mass-energy (unified) do not exist, pre-existing laws, particularly laws of quantum mechanics, do exist. And it is these laws that make it the case that universes can and do, from time to time, pop into existence from \"Nothing,\" creating spacetime as well as mass-energy. (It is standard physics to assume that empty space must seethe with virtual particles, reflecting the uncertainty principle of quantum physics, where particle-antiparticle pairs come into being and then, almost always, in a fleetingly brief moment, annihilate each other.) - Nothing where not only is there no space-time and no mass-energy, but also there are no preexisting laws of physics that could generate space-time or mass-energy (universes). - Nothing where not only is there no space-time, no mass-energy, and no pre-existing laws of physics, but also there are no non-physical things or kinds that are concrete (rather than abstract)\u2014no God, no gods, and no consciousness (cosmic or otherwise). This means that there are no physical or non-physical beings or existents of any kind\u2014nothing, whether natural or supernatural, that is concrete (rather than abstract). - Nothing where not only is there none of the above (so that, as in Nothing 7, there are no concrete existing things, physical or non-physical), but also there are no abstract objects of any kind\u2014no numbers, no sets, no logic, no general propositions, no universals, no Platonic forms (e.g., no value). - Nothing where not only is there none of the above (so that, as in Nothing 8, there are no abstract objects), but also there are no possibilities of any kind (recognizing that possibilities and abstract objects overlap, though allowing that they can be distinguished). Nothings 1 through 7 progressively remove or eliminate existing things, so that a reasonable stopping point\u2014a point at which we might well be thought to have reached (what I hesitatingly call) \"Real Nothing\", the metaphysical limit\u2014would be Nothing Seven, which features no concrete existing things (no physical or non-physical concrete existents) of any kind. Nothings 8 and 9 go further, eliminating nonconcrete objects, things, existents and realities. Do they go too far? Many philosophers assert that neither Nothing 8 nor Nothing 9 is metaphysically possible, arguing that the claimed absence of abstract objects and/or possibilities would constitute a logical contradiction and hence abstract objects and/or possibilities exist necessarily. This could be important because, as John Leslie points out, among the realities which aren't concrete things, or which do not depend on the existence of concrete things, and thus cannot be eliminated, there may be some realities that are plausible candidates for explaining the world of concrete things. [7](note07) In this way of thinking, the crucial distinction is between realities that seemingly can be eliminated and realities that seemingly cannot be eliminated, rather than any particular way of distinguishing between levels of nothingness or particular ways of defining nothingness. Note that among all these levels of Nothing, one of the \"lesser Nothings\"\u2014that is, a kind of Nothing with more \"things\" in it\u2014is the Nothing of physicists. What physicists contemplate\u2014the sudden emergence or \"tunneling\" of universes from \"Nothing\"\u2014is fascinating and indeed may be cosmogenic, but the tunneling process or capacity is not Nothing. [8](note08) The Nothing of physicists is thick with the complete set of the laws of physics, and so between physicists' Nothing and Real Nothing lies a vast, unbridgeable gulf. On this taxonomic scale, physicists' Nothing is Nothing Level 5, barely half way to utterly Nothing. If physicists' Nothing were in reality Real Nothing (i.e., ultimate reality), the laws of quantum physics (or whatever might turn out to be the most fundamental physical laws underlying quantum physics) would have to be either impossible to remove (meaning that eliminating them would involve logical contradiction) or a brute fact about existence beyond which explanation would be meaningless. I doubt I could ever get over the odd idea that something so intricate, so involved, so organized and so accessible as the laws of physics would be the ultimate brute fact. As a separate consideration, some philosophers of religion argue that God is a \"necessity\"\u2014meaning that it would be impossible for God not to exist\u2014 thus precluding Nothing 7 (which has no non-physical concrete things such as God but still has abstract objects) and crowning Nothing 6 (which has no space-time, no mass-energy, no laws of physics but still has God and other nonphysical things) as the metaphysical limit of what is to be explained. [9](note09) I find the move challenging. Moreover, based on the levels of Nothing in this taxonomy, it would seem less of a leap to imagine a world without God (Nothing 7) than to imagine a world without abstract objects (Nothing 8). For the traditional God, that won't do. [10](note10) Why Not Nothing? Cosmic visions are overwhelming, but I am sometimes preoccupied with another conundrum. How is it that we humans have such farsighted understanding after only a few thousand years of historical consciousness, only a few hundred years of effective science, and only a few decades of cosmological observations? Maybe it's still too early in the game. Maybe answers have been with us all along. This is a work in process and diverse contributions are needed. Setting aside my taxonomy and consulting my gut, I come to only two kinds of answers. The first is that there can be no answer: Existence is a brute fact without explanation. The second is that at the primordial beginning, explanatorily and timelessly prior to time, some thing was self-existing. The essence of this something necessitated its existence such that non-existence to it would be as inherently impossible as physical immortality to us is factually impossible. Various things or substances could conceivably contain this deeply centered self-existing essence, from the most fundamental meta-laws of physics to diverse kinds of consciousness, one of which could be God or something like god. Perhaps even these explanations are so mundane and bedrock is so bizarre that abstract objects or pure possibilities somehow harbor generative powers. Why is there Something rather than Nothing? Why Not Nothing? If you don't get dizzy, you really don't get it.

New York: Hill and Wang), may be the proximal cause of why we have a universe in the first place, but cannot be the reason, of itself, why the universe we have works so well for us. Universe-generating mechanisms of themselves, such as unprompted eternal chaotic inflation or uncaused nucleations in spacetime, can only address the fine-tuning problem of our universe by postulating innumerable universes, perhaps an infinity of universes, a vast multiverse, in which the laws of physics must reset randomly in each universe, and must be, in some sense, primordial and foundational. Nor can vacuum energy or quantum tunneling or anything of the like be the ultimate cause of the universe, because, however hackneyed, the still-standing, still-unanswered question remains \"from where did those laws come?\" - The question of whether God, assuming God exists, would be \"necessary\"\u2014 which means that God would exist in all possible worlds\u2014has beset philosophers and theologians for centuries. The much-debated Ontological Argument for the existence of God, which defines God as \"a being than which no greater can be conceived,\" leads to the claim that God is necessary because necessity is a higher perfection than contingency. Richard Swinburne asserts that God is a \"factual necessity\" but not a \"logical necessity\" in that the non-existence of God would introduce no logical contradiction (Closer To Truth). Timothy O'- Connor defends God's necessity in his monograph on the topic. O'Connor, Timothy. 2008.

Oxford: Blackwell. - The relationship between God and abstract objects is particularly troublesome for those who believe that God created and sustains all things and who privilege above all else God's absolute sovereignty (aseity). The reason is that abstract objects, many philosophers believe, exist necessarily, which means that it is impossible for abstract objects not to exist, which further means that it makes no sense for even God to have created them. What would it take to create the idea of the number 3 or the truth that 1+2=3 or the reality that squares are not round? How could such ideas, truths, realities even conceivably be created? Peter van Inwagen calls abstract objects \"putative counterexamples\" to the thesis that God has created everything. But if abstract objects do exist necessarily, then wouldn't God's mental life be encompassed by swarms of infinities of infinities of abstract objects, not only which God would not have created but also over which God could exercise no control? The problem posed by abstract objects for a God whose sovereignty must be absolute is complex and requires metaphysical analysis. Consider two of the more general ways to defend God's sovereignty (aseity): 1) Deny that abstract objects are real, in that numbers, universals, propositions and the like are mere human-invented names with no correspondence in reality (nominalism); and/or 2) claim that abstract objects are thoughts in the mind of God. Van Inwagen rejects both ways; he must therefore defend the position that there are besides God other uncreated beings and thus prefers to restrict God's creation of \"all things visible and invisible\" to \"objects that can enter into causal relations\" (which excludes abstract objects). Van Inwagen, Peter. 2009. \"God and Other Uncreated God](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0415963656/&tag=skepticcom20-20), ed. Kevin Timpe. London: Routledge. On the other hand, William Lane Craig rejects the view that \"there might be things, such as properties and numbers, which are causally unrelated to God as their Creator.\" Craig says that \"Abstract objects have at most an insubstantial existence in the mind of the Logos,\" adding, \"If a Christian theist is to be a platonist, then, he must, it seems, embrace absolute creationism, the view that God has created all the abstract objects there are.\" However, Craig himself resolves the conundrum by espousing nominalism, by judging platonism to be false\u2014so that those pesky abstract objects no longer exist and thus no longer undermine God's sovereignty. Craig, William Lane. 2011. \"Van Inwagen On Uncreated Beings.\" Richard Swinburne argues that abstract objects, which seem to contradict his concept of God, are fictions; the only things that are true or false are human sentences (Closer To Truth).

The rest of his skeptical time is spent investigating paranormal claims with the IIG (Independent Investigations Group), and filming for the JREF (James Randi Educational Foundation). John has two BAs in Philosophy and Theatre Arts from the University of Northern Colorado. Inside the Psychic Mind a book review by John Rael This is not a book for the faint of heart. That is, this is not for the skeptic who has been living in an echo chamber. Your first clue should be the fact that [Psychic Blues](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936239272/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1936239272) has a forward written by James Randi, but includes Uri Geller in the Acknowledgments. There is also no intention to deconstruct the method of hucksters. If you're looking for a critical expos\u00e9 on the inner workings of charlatans, let me remind you that you still haven't read your signed copy of Flim Flam. You will also not find a great amount of animosity towards these peddlers of bullshit. Psychic Blues not only empathizes with psychics, but at times even admires them and their artistry. Whatever you think of these vultures, let it never be said that they aren't creative. I actually think the greatest virtue of this book is its ability to empathize with psychics while rejecting the very premise on which they base their lives. I've never seen psychics handled so gingerly by a skeptic. This was especially surprising coming from Mark Edward, but it wasn't the biggest surprise I received. If you are a skeptical friend/acquaintance of Mark's, you are no doubt familiar with his abrasive, often knee-jerk opinions about psychics. What you may not know, and what may shock the hell out of you, is that Mark is still a practicing psychic. That is, he still puts on the show of being a psychic. For a lot of straight edge skeptics this might sound like a deal breaker. It need not necessarily be. Psychic Blues should not be dismissed even by those who will reject Edward's shallow justifications for continuing to ply his psychic trade. There is no other book I know of that is written by a long-time and current practicing psychic who freely admits to the reader that there is no such thing. There are a couple of books written by reformed psychics, but even [Psychic Mafia](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1573921610/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1573921610&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20) was only critical of the \"fake\" psychics while leaving plenty of room for the \"genuine\" ones. We have dozens of books written from an external skeptical perspective about psychics. And there are hundreds more that come from the true believing clients and practitioners themselves. This represents a unique opportunity that you have very little chance of receiving from the blogs you've decided are the most acceptable. An Extremely Conflicted Medium When I cracked open this book I was expecting to see the dualism between the Mark of the Past and the Mark of the Present. I assumed Past-Mark would be performing and defending his woo while Present-Mark would merely analyze the circumstances of such deception and self-deception. My assumption was correct as often as it was wrong. Mark is truly a \"conflicted\" medium...and person. At times it felt like two different people were writing. Sometimes Past-Mark would defend the woo: \"My belief is nothing more than if I told you I believe in gravity. It is what it is and that's all.\" (104) \"How do you know I'm not really psychic in my spare time? Being a magician and having psychic abilities are not exactly mutually exclusive, you know.\" (76) Sometimes Past-Mark would rail against the woo: \"I have successfully infiltrated the biggest moneymaking scam since the Three-Card Monte.\" (77) Sometimes Present-Mark rejects the woo: \"People want to believe it's all real. None of it is, as far as I know.\" (79) \"My ego had taken on spiked horns and hooves by that point. This was all so wrong.\"(65) Sometimes Present-Mark justifies the woo: \"People will believe whatever they want to believe.\" (218) \"To flatly refuse such requests or to admit to not having any other-worldly connections in this admittedly far-fetched branch of my craft would be to decrease my marketability.\" (79) In other words, he seems to be saying, this is all bunk but it pays the bills. To add to the schizophrenia is the classic Hollywood self-deprecating ego-mania. (An extreme example of this would be Michael Moore, who is more than happy to joke about how ridiculous his success is: \"The fact that I get to make movies is inappropriate.\" However, the moment you question his definition of things like \"facts\" and \"documentary\" he will turn on you with a braggadocio claim like: \"I'm the biggest selling author in America [...] how many more people do I need to convince?!\") There are moments that are apologetic and dark, though often followed by defensive self-aggrandizing. I'm sure most readers would agree that the dark passages are where the book soars. However, I'm willing to admit that this is the dramatic nectar that most of us are predisposed to feed on. No matter who it comes from or what the context is, pain makes for great art. On top of that, this is especially what skeptical readers want from any tale of woo as hurtful as the psychic industry: You must atone for your poppycock! Edward does offer some apologetic moments, but only he is allowed to give you this. There were several instances when he is called out on his psychic act. In those moments, however, Mark slyly defends his brand of entertainment. This is understandable in a time and place when his very livelihood might have been on the line, but even now (years later) he doesn't give any credit to the skeptics of his past. \"Your skepticism is tanking the premise of the show,\" Mark tells some DJ named Ed in the late 90s who is less than pleased to share a time slot with psychics (104). Throughout their working relationship, Ed tells Mark that doing psychic readings is \"unethical,\" takes great pleasure in reading the station's disclaimer, and becomes even more skeptical after Mark recruits a few ringers to call in. At the time, Mark just wanted to be able to do the job he had agreed to do, so some defensiveness is expected. However, even today Mark gives no credit to a man who called a Spade a Spade: \"Unfortunately, like most shortsighted people, these brief moments of unexplainable mystery only served to increase Ed's sense of alienation and aggravation toward the psychics,\" and ironically, \"he was clearly one of those people who is never happy unless he's the center of attention\" (107, 102). The Ends Justify the Medium There is one ideology that Mark tends to lean on, which I would like to take a moment to righteously squash: Consequentialism. Call me a child of G. E. Moore (or Pirsig if you want to hurt my philosophy street cred) but consequentialism is bullshit. It astounds me how much woo the-ends-justify-the-means thinking feeds. \"I know it's just a placebo, but it makes me feel better.\" \"Tell that to the people who have turned their lives around because of that book.\" \"Those guys have helped to discredit the myth of orbs.\" \"Well if he had asked for her consent we might not have Christmas.\" This philosophy gets uglier when it is used to not only judge the value of actions or means, but to appraise the agent carrying out said actions. That is to say, the ends justify the means and validate the person who used those means. Hypothetically, I break into a house. Before I get to the Blu-ray collection, however, I find the homeowner unconscious on the ground with blood coming out of his head. I call the paramedics who come to rescue the homeowner. Can I be called a \"good\" person? I mean, if I hadn't been trying to rob him blind, he would be dead right now. I saved him...like a super hero! I sincerely hope anyone reading this would never entertain the idea that the results of this situation somehow make my actions okay, let alone make me a swell guy. Well, this is very similar to what Edward proposes. I don't want to spoil any of the dramatic details (it was actually my favorite chapter of the book). Suffice to say that he gives a reading to a client through the Psychic Friends Network, which shows Mark that \"there was indeed something genuine amid the fakery and the hucksterism. I had saved someone's life\" (43). I'm willing to believe that everything Mark has written, and everything his superiors at the \"network\" told him about this client are completely and utterly true. I'll buy that this woman might only be alive because she called a psychic network. I'll even grant that maybe a different psychic would have exacerbated the situation, and it was only the gentle touch of Mark Edward that kept her from the cold touch of death. Does this mean that Edward saved her life? Hell no! If Mark had done a psychic reading that averted World War III it still wouldn't make him a hero. That's not how morality works; that's how cognitive dissonance works. \"Though I was playing a small part in a huge commercial system that sold compassion and exploited human misery, as I looked around at the colors of the autumn leaves and breathed in the fresh morning air, the warmth of a new illumination dawned on me. I had an awesome responsibility.\" (43) Before I'm able to judge Edward too harshly, though, I realize that maybe I'm being misdirected by a magician. Once again, this is a passage that demonstrates the conflict and outright desire to possess a pastry and consume it at the same time. Mark is both trying to express the irony and sheer happenstance of his \"pedantic and silly\" reading that resulted in a person continuing to live, and take credit at the same time (43). I saw you force that card, Mark! (He pulls a similar sleight of hand with his definition and use of the word \"psychic\" throughout the book.) The greatest tragedy of this book is that Edward seems to miss out on his own lesson, and it's a really good one: We should all do psychic readings just in case beautiful moments and great consequences result.... Just kidding. The lesson is that we should listen to each other and talk to each other much more than we do. This is the point that Psychic Blues demonstrates so wonderfully over and over again. We need to connect more often and with more honesty. \"That's the real magic; there is a serenity and wisdom to quiet listening,\" he writes (220). Edward sees this but somehow wants to believe that the listening he did and does as a psychic is the same thing. It is not. It reminds me of some of my friends who are Life Coaches (i.e. out of work actors). I mean, they're just being good listeners, giving the best advice they can, and helping to fulfill a very real need of their clients. What's the problem? The problem is that they are not actually friends or family members of their clients. The clients are giving them money, and putting them in a relative position of authority, but they are not a doctor, psychologist, licensed therapist or even an on-call EMT at a Skrillex concert. They are screwing with people's lives without the least amount of expertise. That's not just unethical, it's downright dangerous. Honestly? There is no such thing as an \"honest psychic.\" Taking someone's money based on a lie is not acceptable. Even if it's a lie you never told. Mark never makes the paranormal claim himself. He merely allows his sitter to believe that he is psychic. To him it's a form of entertainment, and since you don't run out halfway through Hamlet to explain \"this guy's not really the prince of Denmark,\" why would you tell a sitter that you got her name off her tacky gold necklace? Another analogy that Mark likes to use, courtesy of his friend Docc Hilford, is that \"doing a disclaimer is kind of like walking into a really fancy French restaurant, and right before they serve your food the chef comes out and says it 'came out of a can'.\" No. Talking about canned food isn't the problem; conning your customers into paying good money for canned food is the problem. I understand that Mark Edward is an entertainer first and a skeptic second. I can even relate to that fact. If it ever came down to it and I had to pick between doing art and upholding my skeptical principles, I would pick my art in a second. However, I would have no illusions about or excuses for that choice. I know Mark would like to believe that he has \"infiltrated\" the psychic industry in much the same way that I want to believe I \"infiltrate\" the world of chiropractic every time I'm hired to play a patient for an unnamed school's video series (true story). However, the truth is that we both need the money and, more importantly, these jobs offer us at least a minor opportunity to put our most prized talents to work. Are we ignoring some of our principles to do it? Probably, but sometimes an artist is willing to give up a little bit of decency for the chance to pay a few bills with art. And now, after I've lost a chunk of my soul in exchange for a bachelor-degree-justifying paycheck, I can return to my skeptic pals with some brand new insights about the inner workings of the chiropractic industry. This is a bonus. This is not a free pass of self-justification that will allow me to rename myself as the Double Agent of Chiropractic. Edward: \"I pretended I was Patrick McGoohan in an episode of Secret Agent. I was undercover. There are many similarities between what a good magician or mentalist does and what a spy is tasked to do; it's all down to staging, misdirection, and sight lines\" (65). Secret Agent Man. Conclusion Psychic Blues is an important work that should not be overlooked. It presents a unique insight that you will not find anywhere else, and could not be delivered by anyone but Mark Edward. As James Randi says, \"he has the background experience to write such a book from a totally different point of view from anyone else I know.\" Yes, this book may also piss you off, and even have you face-palming at times. But do you want to learn about psychics? The people, not the tricks? Do you want to understand who psychics are and not just how they operate? Here is your book.

Or consider the \"tale of two high jumpers\" that David Epstein presents in [The Sports Gene](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591845114/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1591845114&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20), his important book on the relative roles of genes and environment\u2014nature and nurture\u2014in the building of a professional athlete. Mr. Epstein spent time with a Swedish high jumper named Stefan Holm, who started jumping at age 6. By the time he won the Olympic gold medal in the 2004 Athens games, he had logged more than 20,000 hours of training. Mr. Holm told the author that, to understand how he became an Olympic champion, Mr. Epstein should read Malcolm Gladwell's \"Outliers,\" particularly the chapters on the \"10,000-hour rule\" discovered by psychologist K. Anders Ericsson\u2014that is, the idea that, to become an expert or professional at just about anything, it takes roughly 10,000 hours, or 10 years at 20 hours a week, of \"deliberate practice.\" This is practice that is guided, coached or focused in a way that is beyond just mindless repetition. But then how do you explain Mr. Epstein's second high jumper? In the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan, the training machine Stefan Holm was beaten by a Bahamas man named Donald Thomas, who had started high jumping only a few months before. Mr. Thomas had boasted to his jock buddies that he could slam-dunk a basketball. Someone challenged him to high-jump a 6-foot-6 bar, which he easily cleared, followed by one at 6-foot-8 and then 7 feet. A successful 7-foot-3 jump in competition landed him in the Commonwealth Games in Australia just two months after he had first heard about high jumping. There he finished fourth in a field of world-class jumpers. At the World Championships\u2014after a total of eight months of high-jump coaching, which included ducking out to shoot baskets, because he found high jumping \"kind of boring\"\u2014Mr. Thomas defeated not just Mr. Holm but a 6-foot-6 Russian named Yaroslav Rybakov, who had failed to win a single world championship after 18 years of competition. Today, six years into his high-jumping career and thousands of hours of practice later, Mr. Thomas hasn't improved his performance by even one centimeter. What's wrong with the 10,000-hour rule? In part, Mr. Ericsson's research was oversimplified by Mr. Gladwell in \"Outliers,\" leading everyone from sports athletes to Wall Street hedge-fund managers to employ it in their explanations of success. (The supposedly triumphant example in \"Outliers\" was the Beatles, who Mr. Gladwell claims owed their success largely to the 10,000 hours they played in dingy nightclubs in Liverpool and Hamburg, Germany\u2014selectively ignoring the thousands of garage bands who put in their 10,000 hours and still stink.) As Mr. Epstein notes, 10,000 hours is an average. What is more revealing is the range. A 2007 study on chess players, for example, found that the average number of hours logged to make it to the level of \"master\" was 11,000 hours, but the range spanned from 3,000 hours for one player to 23,000 hours for another. Even more telling, several players in the study put in more than 25,000 hours of practice and study and never made it to the master level. That is the mystery that The Sports Gene explains so well. Science shows that by nature humans vary considerably in both physical and mental abilities, and a good portion of that variation is due to our genes. In the early 20th century, the psychologist Edward Thorndike discovered that, while practice makes a difference, some people benefit from practice more than others. In the mid-20th century, David Wechsler published a book titled \"The Range of Human Capacities,\" in which he noted that the ratio of performance (measuring by the appropriate criteria) in a wide variety of physical and mental tasks, from best to the worst, was between 2 to 1 and 3 to 1. More recently, Georgia Tech psychologist Phillip Ackerman found that the effectiveness of practice depends on the task. As Mr. Epstein explains: \"In simple tasks, practice brings people closer together, but in complex ones, it often pulls them apart.\" A study on grocery checkout clerks, for example, found that the more experienced are much faster than novices, but in a group of clerks who all have 10 years of experience, the best are three times faster than the slowest. In the sports realm, a study on darts players by Mr. Ericsson found that only 28% of the variance in performance between players was accounted for after 15 years of practice. The other 72% is coming from somewhere other than practice. Mr. Epstein's apt analogy for the interaction of genes and environment is computer hardware and software: \"The hardware is useless without the software, just as the reverse is true. Sport skill acquisition doesn't happen without both specific genes and a specific environment, and often the genes and the environment must coincide at a specific time.\" The best study on this is called the Heritage Family Study, which subjected 98 two-generation families to stationary bicycle-training regimens to increase fitness, as measured by aerobic capacity, or VO2 max\u2014the amount of oxygen a person's body can use. All the families received the same training of three workouts per week of increasing intensity, and DNA was taken from all 481 participants. The results were startling: The range in VO2 max improvement spanned from 0% to 100%, depending on the family heritage. About 15% of participants showed little to no improvement, while another 15% increased their VO2max by 50% or more. According to the study's principle investigator, Claude Bouchard, \"the range of response to training was six to nine times larger between pairs of brothers than within pairs.\" In other words, genes matter. How much? \"Statistical analysis showed that about half of each person's ability to improve their aerobic capacity with training was determined exclusively by their parents,\" Mr. Epstein explains. \"The amount that any person improved in the study had nothing to do with how aerobically fit he or she was relative to others to begin with.\" Rather, it had to do with genetic inheritance. The DNA analysis turned up 21 gene variants related to aerobic improvement, and the participants in the Heritage study who had at least 19 of the 21 genes improved their VO2 max three times more than subjects with fewer than 10 of the gene variants. Maybe this explains why I couldn't catch Jonathan Boyer in the Race Across America. The Sports Gene is bound to put the cat among the pigeons in the blank-slate crowd who think that we can all be equal as long as we equalize environmental inputs such as practice. But the science says that it just ain't so. Not even 10,000 hours of wishful thinking will change nature.

Prothero reviews [Darwin's Doubt: The Explosive Origin of Animal Life and the Case for Intelligent Design](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062071475/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0062071475&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20) by Stephen Meyer (HarperCollins, 2013). [Read Prothero's full Fumbling Bumbling Amateur Cambrian Follies a book review by Donald R. Prothero \"In everything the prudent acts with knowledge, but a fool flaunts his folly.\" \"Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge.\" \"The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.\" The Dunning-Kruger effect is a well-known phenomenon in psychology first named in 1998, but it has been recognized since before the Bible and Shakespeare. In a nutshell, it is (as Bertrand Russell put it) \"The trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt.\" There is also another well-known psychological phenomenon: motivated reasoning. Our brains have many blind spots in them that allow us to reconcile the real world with the world as we want it to be, and reduce the clash of cognitive dissonance. The most familiar of these is confirmation bias, where we see only what we want to see, and ignore or forget anything that doesn't fit our preferred world-view. When this bias emerges in argument, it takes the form of cherry-picking: finding a few facts out of context that seem to support what we want to believe, and ignoring everything else that contradicts what we are trying to promote. The entire literature of creationism (and of its recent offspring, \"intelligent design\" creationism) works entirely on that principle: they don't like any science that disagrees with their view of religion, so they pick tiny bits out of context that seem to support what they want to believe, and cherry-pick individual cases which fits their bias. In their writings, they are legendary for \"quote-mining\": taking a quote out of context to mean the exact opposite of what the author clearly intended (sometimes unintentionally, but often deliberately and maliciously). They either cannot understand the scientific meaning of many fields from genetics to paleontology to geochronology, or their bias filters out all but tiny bits of a research subject that seems to comfort them, and they ignore all the rest. Another common tactic of creationists is credential mongering. They love to flaunt their Ph.D.'s on their book covers, giving the uninitiated the impression that they are all-purpose experts in every topic. As anyone who has earned a Ph.D. knows, the opposite is true: the doctoral degree forces you to focus on one narrow research problem for a long time, so you tend to lose your breadth of training in other sciences. Nevertheless, they flaunt their doctorates in hydrology or biochemistry, then talk about paleontology or geochronology, subjects they have zero qualification to discuss. Their Ph.D. is only relevant in the field where they have specialized training. It's comparable to asking a Ph.D. to fix your car or write a symphony\u2014they may be smart, but they don't have the appropriate specialized training to do a competent job based on their Ph.D. alone. Stephen Meyer's first demonstration of these biases was his atrociously incompetent book [Signature in the Cell](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061472794/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061472794&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20) (2009, HarperOne), which was universally lambasted by molecular biologists as an amateurish effort by someone with no firsthand training or research experience in molecular biology. (Meyer's Ph.D. is in history of science, and his undergrad degree is in geophysics, which give him absolutely no background to talk about molecular evolution). Undaunted by this debacle, Meyer now blunders into another field in which he has no research experience or advanced training: my own profession, paleontology. I can now report that he's just as incompetent in my field as he was in molecular biology. Almost every page of this book is riddled by errors of fact or interpretation that could only result from someone writing in a subject way over his head, abetted by the creationist tendency to pluck facts out of context and get their meaning completely backwards. But as one of the few people in the entire creationist movement who has actually taken a few geology classes (but apparently no paleontology classes), he is their \"expert\" in this area, and is happy to mislead the creationist audience that knows no science at all with his slick but completely false understanding of the subject. Let's take the central subject of the book: the \"Cambrian explosion\", or the apparently rapid diversification of life during the Cambrian Period, starting about 545 million years (m.y.) ago. When Darwin wrote about it in 1859, it was indeed a puzzle, since so little was known about the fossil record then. But as paleontologists have worked hard on the topic and learned a lot since about 1945 (as I discuss in detail in my 2007 book, [Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why it Matters](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b127HB)). As a result, we now know that the \"explosion\" took place over an 80 m.y. time frame. Paleontologists are gradually abandoning the misleading and outdated term \"Cambrian explosion\" for a more accurate one, \"Cambrian slow fuse\" or \"Cambrian diversification.\" The entire diversification of life is now known to have gone through a number of distinct steps, from the first fossils of simple bacterial life 3.5 billion years old, to the first multicellular animals 700 m.y. ago (the Ediacara fauna), to the first evidence of skeletonized fossils (tiny fragments of small shells, nicknamed the \"little shellies\") at the beginning of the Cambrian, 545 m.y. ago (the Nemakit-Daldynian and Tommotian stages of the Cambrian), to the third stage of the Cambrian (Atdabanian, 530 m.y. ago), when you find the first fossils of the larger animals with hard shells, such as trilobites. Does Meyer reflect this modern understanding of the subject? No! His figures (e.g., Figs. 2.5, 2.6, 3.8) portray the \"explosion\" as if it happened all at once, showing that he has paid no attention to the past 70 years of discoveries. He dismisses the Ediacara fauna as not clearly related to living phyla (a point that is still debated among paleontologists), but its very existence is fatal to the creationist falsehood that multicellular animals appeared all at once in the fossil record with no predecessors. Even more damning, Meyer completely ignores the existence of the first two stages of the Cambrian (nowhere are they even mentioned in the book) and talks about the Atdabanian stage as if it were the entire Cambrian all by itself. His misleading figures (e.g., Fig. 2.5, 2.6, 3.8) imply that there were no modern phyla in existence until the trilobites diversified in the Atdabanian. That's a flat out lie. Even a casual glance at any modern diagram of life's diversification (Figure 1) demonstrates that probable arthropods, cnidarians, and echinoderms are present in the Ediacara fauna, mollusks and sponges are well documented from the Nemakit-Daldynian Stage, and brachiopods and archaeocyathids appear in the Tommotian Stage\u2014all millions of years before Meyer's incorrectly defined \"Cambrian explosion\" in the Atdabanian. The phyla that he lists in Fig. 2.6 as \"explosively\" appearing in the Atdabanian stages all actually appeared much earlier\u2014or they are soft-bodied phyla from the Chinese Chengjiang fauna, whose first appearance artificially inflates the count. Meyer deliberately and dishonestly distorts the story by implying that these soft-bodied animals appeared all at once, when he knows that this is an artifact of preservation. It's just an accident that there are no extraordinary soft-bodied faunas preserved before Chengjiang, so we simply have no fossils demonstrating their true first appearance, which occurred much earlier based on molecular evidence. Meyer's distorted and false view of conflating the entire Early Cambrian (545-520 m.y. ago) as consisting of only the third stage of the Early Cambrian (Atdabanian, 530-525 m.y. ago) creates a fundamental lie that falsifies everything else he says in the ensuing chapters. He even attacks me (p. 73) by claiming that during our 2009 debate, it was I who was improperly redefining the Cambrian! Even a cursory glance at any recent paleontology book on the topic, or even the Wikipedia site for \"Cambrian explosion\", shows that it is Meyer who has cherry-picked and distorted the record, completely ignoring the 15 million years of the first two stages of the Cambrian because their existence shoots down his entire false interpretation of the fossil record. Sorry, Steve, but you don't get to contradict every paleontologist in the world, ignore the evidence from the first two stages of the Cambrian, and redefine the Early Cambrian as the Atdabanian Stage just to fit your fairy tale! Even if we grant the premise that a lot of phyla appear in the Atdabanian (solely because there are no soft-bodied faunas older than Chengjiang in the earliest Cambrian), Meyer claims the 5-6 million years of the Atdabanian are too fast for evolution to produce all the phyla of animals. Wrong again! Lieberman (2003) showed that rates of evolution during the \"Cambrian explosion\" are typical of any adaptive radiation in life's history, whether you look at the Paleocene diversification of the mammals after the non-avian dinosaurs vanished, or even the diversification of humans from their common ancestor with apes 6 m.y. ago. As distinguished Harvard paleontologist Andrew Knoll put it in his 2003 book, [Life on a Young Planet](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691120293/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0691120293&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20): Was there really a Cambrian Explosion? Some have treated the issue as semantic\u2014anything that plays out over tens of millions of years cannot be \"explosive,\" and if the Cambrian animals didn't \"explode,\" perhaps they did nothing at all out of the ordinary. Cambrian evolution was certainly not cartoonishly fast ... Do we need to posit some unique but poorly understood evolutionary process to explain the emergence of modern animals? I don't think so. The Cambrian Period contains plenty of time to accomplish what the Proterozoic didn't without invoking processes unknown to population geneticists\u201420 million years is a long time for organisms that produce a new generation every year or two. (Knoll, 2003, p. 193) The mistakes and deliberate misunderstandings and misinterpretations go on and on, page after page. Meyer takes the normal scientific debates about the early conflicts about the molecular vs. morphological trees of life as evidence scientists know nothing, completely ignoring the recent consensus between these data sets. Like all creationists, he completely misinterprets the Eldredge and Gould punctuated equilibrium model and claims that they are arguing that evolution doesn't occur\u2014when both Gould and Eldredge have clearly explained many times (which he never cites) why their ideas are compatible with Neo-Darwinism and not any kind of support for any form of creationism. He repeats many of the other classic creationist myths, all long debunked, including the post hoc argument from probability (you can't make the argument that something is unlikely after the fact). He wastes a full chapter on the empty concept of \"information\" as the ID creationists define it. He butchers the subject of systematic biology, using the normal debate between competing hypotheses to argue that scientists can't make up their minds\u2014when that is the ordinary way in which scientific questions are argued until consensus has been reached. He confuses crown-groups with stem-groups, botches the arguments about recognition of ancestors in the fossil record, and can't tell a cladogram from a family tree. He blunders through the fields of epigenetics and evo-devo and genetic drift as if they completely falsified Neo-Darwinism, rather than as scientists view them\u2014as supplements to our understanding of it. (Even if they did somehow shoot down some aspects of Neo-Darwinism, they are providing additional possible mechanisms for evolution, something he supposedly does not believe in!). In short, he runs the full gamut of topics in modern evolutionary biology, managing to distort or confuse every one of them, and only demonstrating that he is completely incapable of understanding these topics. In several places in the book, he shows his pictures of the Cambrian sections in China, or talks in the final chapter about visiting the Burgess Shale in Canada (a Middle Cambrian locality, millions of years after the \"Cambrian explosion\" was long over), as if to establish his street-cred that he at least got away from his office and computer once in a while. Visiting these famous places like a tourist doesn't qualify you to write a guidebook of the complexity of the fossils that were recovered there. If he had actually done the hard work of learning about paleontology and doing the research in the field himself (as real scientists have), we might take him seriously. As it is, this book only demonstrates that Meyer can completely misunderstand, misinterpret and misread subjects like paleontology just as badly as he botched his interpretation of molecular biology. (For a good account by real paleontologists who know what they're doing, see the excellent recent book by Valentine and Erwin, 2013, which gives an accurate view of the \"Cambrian diversification\"). Finally, one might wonder: what's all the fuss about the \"Cambrian explosion\"? Why should it matter whether evolution was fast or slow during the third stage of the Cambrian? Some scientists might find this puzzling, but you must understand the minds of creationists. They operate by a \"god of the gaps\" argument: anything that is currently not easily explained by science is automatically attributed to supernatural causes. Even though ID creationists say that this supernatural designer could be any deity or even extraterrestrials, it is well documented that they are thinking of the Judeo-Christian god when they point to the complexity and \"design\" of life. They argue that if scientists haven't completely explained every possible event of the Early Cambrian, science has failed and we must consider supernatural causes. Of course, this is a lie. For one thing, Meyer's description of the \"Cambrian explosion\" is distorted and false, since he deliberately ignores the events of the first two stages of the Cambrian. Secondly, this \"god of the gaps\" approach is guaranteed to fail, because scientists have explained most of the events of the Early Cambrian and find nothing out of the ordinary that defies scientific explanation. Only a few details remain to be worked out. As our fossil record of that time interval improves and we understand it even better, there will be nothing left for the creationists to point to that might require supernatural intervention. This is a losing strategy for them in every possible way. In short, Meyer has shown that his first disastrous book was not a fluke: he is capable of going into any field in which he has no training or research experience and botching it just as badly as he did molecular biology. As I've written before, if you are a complete amateur and don't understand a subject, don't demonstrate the Dunning-Kruger effect by writing a book about it and proving your ignorance to everyone else! Some people with creationist leanings or little understanding of paleontology might find this long-winded, confusingly written book convincing, but anyone with a decent background in paleontology can easily see through his distortions and deliberate misunderstandings and misinterpretations. Even though Amazon.com persists in listing this book in their \"Paleontology\" subsection, I've seen a number of bookstores already which have it properly placed in their \"Religion\" section\u2014or even more appropriately, in \"Fiction.\" References - Erwin, D., and J.W.

About this week's it be that paleontologists, ecologists, comparative anatomists, physiologists, all about evolution? In this week's eSkeptic, Ingrid Hansen Smythe reviews a documentary film by Ray Comfort called Evolution vs. God: Shaking the Foundations of Faith. The film makes the audacious claim that \"there is no evidence for Darwinian evolution; that it's not scientific.\" [Watch the trailer](https://youtu.be/1gv2xbXkAfs) and then read the review. Ingrid Hansen Smythe (BMus, BA, MA) is a freelance writer, playwright, and the author of three books\u2014 [Dwynwen's Feast](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1450276970/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1450276970&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20), [Stories for Animals](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1450296661/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1450296661&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20), and [Poetry for Animals](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0091492GE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0091492GE&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20). Visit her at [www.ihsmythe.ca](http://www.ihsmythe.ca/). Guess Who Wins a film review by Ingrid Hansen Smythe \"I believe it's going to take down evolution. It exposes it as bogus science. That sounds like a bold claim, but it's true.\" [1] \"There is no refutation of Darwinian evolution in existence. If a refutation ever were to come about it would come from a serious scientist\u2014not an idiot.\" [2] Ray Comfort, the professional preacher and proselytizer best known for his unwitting invention of the banana fallacy, is on the attack once again with his latest film Evolution vs. God. According to one reviewer this is a powerful film that leaves evolutionists \"clutching at straws,\" [3](#note03) and Ray Comfort himself has issued a warning, saying, \"I would say not to watch it if you are someone who believes in evolution, but you are weak in the faith.\" [4](#note04) Creationists claim that ever since the film's release evolutionists have been in \"damage control\" [5](#note05) and most significant of all, there's been \"an eerie silence from Professor Dawkins.\" [6](#note06) One imagines the beleaguered Dr. Dawkins sweating and grimacing in his underground biology bunker, surrounded by troll-like Darwinians all frantically trying to get their stories straight. \"All right, people, next on the agenda is the doctrine of speciation. Who has faith in that godless heresy? Can I see a show of hands, please?\" It is astonishing to think that, of all people, Ray Comfort (now commonly known as Banana Man) has discovered, through his own tireless research, that the geneticists, the biochemists, the zoologists, the biologists, the geologists, the paleontologists, the ecologists, the comparative anatomists and physiologists, the cosmologists\u2014the whole lot of them\u2014have been entirely mistaken all this time. And if Ray's film does what it claims, it will mean a scientific revolution on a scale the like of which has never been seen in the history of humanity. Note too that, in this film, Ray doesn't interview any \"creation scientists\" as they rather comically call themselves, [7](#note07) but only experts in the relevant disciplines, finally letting the godless Darwinians speak for themselves. How amazing that the Everest-like mountain of hard evidence for evolution might be razed to the ground in one brief 38-minute film by a man with only a high school education and a reputation for being, as Dawkins says, an idiot. [8](#note08) Truly this is the mother of all David-and-Goliath tales, and so it was with great expectations that I settled in with my peanut butter and banana crackers and watched Evolution vs. God: Shaking the Foundations of Faith. Well. If you haven't seen Evolution vs. God, you'll just have to believe me when I tell you that this is a truly excellent film\u2014if by \"film\" you mean a thin haze, blur, mist, cloud or veil\u2014i.e., something that's abnormally opaque, as in \"a film of horseshit.\" However, if by \"film\" you mean \"movie\"\u2014or, in particular, \"documentary\" (i.e. a work of nonfiction)\u2014then I'm afraid you might be a trifle disappointed with what Ray has to offer. Of course there's the obvious point that evolution vs. God is a false dichotomy to begin with, and that millions of people are perfectly capable of believing in God and simultaneously accepting evolution as a fact. Trouble only arises for fundamentalists like Ray, but all other believers accept both ideas to be true without their heads exploding from the pressure. Even the Pope's on board with this one and believes that the process of evolution brought all life into existence, except human souls of course, which the Church believes are specially created by God\u2014and who are we to argue with the claim that an insensible agent manufactures an insensible product? That's just hilarious, not necessarily an immediate threat to the scientific endeavour. So besides the whole enterprise being hopelessly flawed from the get-go, what else is wrong with Evolution vs. God? It's not that the production values are so terrible\u2014the lighting is good, for example, and the music sets the right emotional tone of looming hellfire\u2014but the shooting angle is bizarre as the camera is often set very low and pointed upwards (toward heaven, presumably) and so most of the movie is shot up people's noses, presumably by a dwarf. Thankfully the four experts that Ray interviews had no unruly nose hair, but that's about all Gail Kennedy, Craig Stanford, Peter Nonacs, and especially P.Z. Myers have to be thankful for. That's because Ray's idea of consulting with the experts is to give them fewer than five minutes of total airtime between them and to keep them occupied the entire time with asinine questions that\u2014due to his use of voice-overs and selective editing\u2014may, or may not, have been the asinine questions he actually asked. [9](#note09) Dr. Peter Nonacs, for example, gets a grand total of 53 seconds to summarize his vast storehouse of knowledge\u2014but, of course, he's not actually given a chance to talk about anything meaningful at all. All of his time, and everyone else's, is taken up answering Ray's fruitless questions\u2014\"Have you ever stolen anything?\" \"How would you make a rose?\" \"Is rape wrong?\"\u2014at which point Ray captures the scientist's bewildered expressions on camera as they apparently ruminate on Ray's brilliant gotcha questions (though in reality they're probably thinking that Ray's brain is a great example of a vestigial organ. It might have been good for something once, but...). Ray's habit of asking leading questions in conjunction with close-up headshots is also disturbing, and poor Dr. Gail Kennedy gets the worst of it as she appears to be pinned against a wall in an interrogation room. Dr. Craig Stanford is literally cornered as Ray shoves a microphone in his face (his interviewing technique with all his subjects)\u2014a microphone that simply screams \"phallic symbol\" and reminds one of the Latin word irrumo (i.e. \"mouth-rape\"). \"Here,\" Ray seems to be saying, \"I've got some words to put in your mouth.\" Yuck! It's all kind of creepy, especially when Ray asks questions like, \"Have you ever looked at a guy with lust?\" (\"Not recently,\" Gail quips drily.) Stylistically, Ray is careful to keep his scenes short, snappy, and pointless. Begin scene. Ray Comfort: You think you're a primate? P.Z. Myers: Yes I am. Ray: Are you a talking primate? P.Z.: I am. Ray: Are you a cousin of bananas? P.Z.: Why yes. End scene. This is what Ray understands to be plumbing the depths of the expert's knowledge. Another example: Begin scene: P.Z.: Human beings are still fish. Ray: Human beings are fish? P.Z.: Why yes of course they are. End scene. Something tells me that Ray has never heard of Sarcopterygii (the clade that includes both the bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates). But even if a sarcopterygian snuck up behind him and bit him on the bum, I have a feeling that Ray wouldn't give a toss because his obsession, from which he cannot be diverted, is asking the question, \"Can you think of any observable evidence for Darwinian evolution where there's a change of kind?\" He asks this question repeatedly, but note that by \"kind\" Ray doesn't mean \"species\" because, as he patiently explains to the dumbfounded Dr. Stanford, there are 14 different definitions of the word species. (Who knew?) No, Ray wants to see a change of kind, a weasel word that he uses to mean kingdom, genera, species, or whatever suggests itself in the moment. Essentially what Ray wants to see is a magic trick where a dog changes into a cat before his very eyes. He wants a couple of twigs at the tips of a cladogram to bring forth each other, rather than tracing both species back to a common ancestor. Peter Nonacs explains that what Ray is describing is macroevolution, which necessarily takes millions of years, but this just confirms Ray's boneheaded understanding that if we can't observe it directly, it's not science. Ray doesn't understand that science involves more than just observation. It involves logical inference and collecting data to support one model or another, but even when the scientists try to explain that we can observe changes in bacteria, in fish, in birds (and that any mutation makes evolution impossible to ignore, because the difference between micro and macroevolution is simply one of scale), Ray turns a resolutely deaf ear. When he isn't busy asking the experts pointed questions like, \"How do you spell shop?\" [10](#note10), Ray is preying on fresh-faced college students who are even more easily stumped by his irrelevant and misleading questions, most of which have nothing to do with evolution. That's because, perhaps surprisingly, Ray Comfort doesn't give a monkey's uncle about evolution. He's interested in using the word \"evolution\" without the meaning behind it and then promoting a cartoonish, slapstick, knock-off version, as in this highly amusing example taken from his blog: All animals, all fish and reptiles have the ability to reproduce of their own kind because they have females within the species. No male can reproduce and keep its kind alive without a female of the same species. Dogs, cats, horses, cattle, elephants, humans, giraffes, lions, tigers, birds, fish, and reptiles all came into being having both male and female. If any species came into existence without a mature female present (with complimentary female components), that one male would have remained alone and in time died. The species could not have survived without a female. Why did hundreds of thousands of animals, fish, reptiles and birds (over millions of years) evolve a female partner (that coincidentally matured at just the right time) with each species?\" [11] Here we see Ray's preschool education paying off royally as he refuses to be taken in by such malarkey. Who in their right mind would believe that a mature female (we'll call her Eve) just happened coincidentally to evolve at precisely the same time as the male (we'll call him Adam) in order to keep the species going? This kooky vision in which distinct species arise one at a time, rather than emerging from breeding groups that eventually diverge, is a preposterous one, as Ray has cleverly deduced. Of course nobody does believe it given that this scenario bears as much resemblance to evolution as the laws of nature in a Roadrunner cartoon resemble the laws of physics in real life. In fact, one can easily imagine that Ray might have made a film called Physics vs. God in which we see the coyote suspended in the air for a full three seconds after the rocky overhang gives way, and the voice over saying, \"Gravity? There's your gravity! Now that takes faith!\" [12](#note12) No, Ray Comfort isn't interested in evolution. The following quote indicates what's really on his mind: Today, atheists are pushing Darwin's little theory and it has opened the floodgates to abortion, fornication, pornography, homosexuality and adultery. If there is no God and we are just primates, then there's no ultimate right and wrong. Anything goes as long as it gets society's smile. [13] Ah ha! It's the age-old, muddled, morbid fascination with sex that's plagued Christianity ever since Mary said, \"Well, all right, as long as I'm still a virgin afterwards.\" Essentially, creationism is holy; evolution is skanky. The thinking goes like this: I choose to believe blindly in evolution because I'm hellbent on denying the existence of a God who demands that I NOT THINK ABOUT SEX. Fornication, homosexuality, adultery, pornography, and abortion\u2014these are all very bad things and God says I mustn't have anything to do with them. Sadly, however, I've either participated in all these things or they're on my bucket list. A couple of them I'm even hoping to do at the same time. And that's why I believe in evolution. That's a fair representation of the argument, and if it makes no sense to you that's your problem and you're going to hell. Ray seems to honestly believe that the reason people think evolution is true is not because of the evidence found in, say, our genome or the fossil record; no, people choose to espouse evolution wilfully in order to kick that Giant Celestial Funsucker out of the equation (even though they know in their hearts He's real), thereby temporarily relieving the need to be accountable to Almighty Him. In one of the only decent complete thoughts that wasn't edited out of the video, Craig Stanford says, \"What Darwin showed in his work on evolution and natural selection is that we don't need to invoke any supernatural force or power to account for the development of life through time on Earth.\" That's why Ray's knickers are in a twist. No need for God means we make our own morality and this leads directly to what Ray calls the sins of the flesh, and the rest of us call a normal life. [14](#note14) Ray Comfort is possibly the best example ever of the phenomenon Michael Shermer describes in his book [The Believing Brain](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b144PB)\u2014that a person arrives at a belief first and only then (in Ray's case in particular) bumbles about looking for all the evidence to back it up, no matter how nutty the belief may be. [15](#note15) For example, \"We are not animals\" [16](#note16)\u2014this is one of Ray's claims and it's an excellent example of just what you'd expect from a person picking a position, in the same way a person picks a sports team, and then sticking with that position dogmatically, even in the face of the evidence (not to mention the face in the mirror). And because he utterly ignores the evidence, Ray mistakenly thinks this is what we all do\u2014but no matter how many times it's pointed out that the scientific method is the great corrective to this pitfall, and we have to be aware of our biases and properly agnostic about that which we cannot know, Ray doesn't get it, as evidenced by the following exchange: Ray Comfort: Peter, could you be wrong about God's existence? Peter Nonacs: Yes. And could you be wrong about God's existence? Ray Comfort: No. Ray's cognitive style includes a childlike trust in authority, an intolerance of ambiguity, a tendency to be convinced by easy answers and suspicious of answers that are complicated, an inability to draw a straight line from cause to effect, and binary thinking on a truly grand scale. [17](#note17) For Ray there are no continuums, no gradations or sliding scales. Everything is good or bad, right or wrong, my way or the highway. Understanding evolution by imagining his mother holding hands with her mother, who is holding hands with her mother, and so on back down the ancestral line until the hands aren't hands anymore but something like paws, and then something like fins, and then something else entirely, is an exercise that's impossible for a guy like Ray. Imagining that we're all transitional species\u2014we're all intermediaries\u2014is not something Ray can do. It's undoubtedly what Dr. Kennedy was getting at when she said, \"The problem with those who are unable to see evolution, I think, is they don't have imaginations.\" Ray thinks he's scored a victory here, equating the imaginative person with the fantasist, but only a man who lacked imagination would think so. And speaking of imagination, I conclude by envisaging an alternate account of the creation story in the book of Genesis. Suppose for a moment that the Bible said something like this: Genesis 1. In the beginning was a BANG, and lo it was big, and it was called the Big Bang. And all things proceedeth out of the mouth of the bang, except the Lord thy God, who awoke saying, \"Whence cometh that bang?\"; and the wife of God answered, saying, \"What bang? Quit asking about bangs already\"; and the Lord rolleth over and snoreth much, so that the drapes wafteth in the breeze and the dresser drawers goeth in and out. And the Lord thy God sleepeth heavily through the ages with many zzzees shooting from His lips, while the stars formeth in the heavens, and life evolveth on the Earth; from the creeping things, to the flying things, to the typing things. And yet God slept, waking only once to flood the Earth, which was better than the night before when God had gotten up at least five times. 2. And when God awoke He looked upon the Earth and shaketh His head, saying, \"Intelligent design, my arse.\" And the Lord flew down to Earth and asketh Mankind, \"What giveth thou the idea that the Lord thy God had anything to do with this giant turd?\" And Mankind did point to a book, saying, \"But thou said\u2014\"; and God picketh up the book and swatteth Mankind over the head, saying, \"Thou callest this journalism? I never said any of this stuff!\" And Mankind did scuff its foot, and mutter \"Aw shucks,\" and stare embarrassed at the ground. 3. And the evening and the morning was the first day. If that was the Biblical account, Banana Ray would be the captain of Team Evolution and his latest film would have been called Evolution vs. Satan\u2014but, no luck. We're stuck with the Bible as written with its damaging origin myth, which not only gets evolution wrong but, worse still, imagines women created as an afterthought out of a rib, thereby giving the nod to several thousand years of sexism, patriarchy, and its inherent abuse. [18](#note18) And we're also stuck with God's representative on Earth, Ray Comfort, who believes that creationism is scientific because it can be observed (every animal bringing forth after its own kind) and therefore doesn't require faith\u2014but that evolution is unscientific because it can't be observed (at least, he can't see it) and is therefore the faith-based stance. It's a hopelessly twisted position, born of ignorance, inflamed by fear, and perpetuated by a man so clueless, he thinks his pathetic, wandering argument is actually significant. It's silly, it's virulent and, most unfortunately, it's dangerous. In fact\u2014you might even call it bananas.

In this week's eSkeptic, Donald R. Prothero reports on what happened when an independent lab checked the samples. [Read Prothero's bio](#Prothero) after the article. This post first appeared on [Skepticblog.org](http://www.skepticblog.org/2013/07/10/bigfoot-dna-bogus/). Bigfoot DNA? It's Playing Possum! by Donald R. Prothero Last February, the news and blogosphere was buzzing with excitement. Someone had [claimed that they had sequenced the DNA of Bigfoot](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/19/bigfoot-dna-controversy-science-journal_n_2711676.html)! Naturally, such a sensational story was reported all over the internet and even the mainstream media as if it were solid, confirmed research. If there was any skepticism displayed, it was at the very end of a story that mostly gave the claim uncritical coverage. A number of mainstream scientists and skeptics wrote critical [blogs](http://doubtfulnews.com/2012/11/melba-ketchum-announces-bigfoot-dna-results-without-the-data/) and [articles](https://www.researchgate.net/post/Melba_Ketchums_Bigfoot_DNA_study--the_ethics_of_skipping_peer-review_for_monetary_gain) about the way the discovery was announced and the fact that it was announced without a publication backing it up, but everyone had to reserve judgment until the paper was actually published\u2014and even more importantly, when the results were double-checked by an independent lab. There were lots of reason for doubting the reality of the report. To start with, the researcher, Dr. Melba Ketchum (a long-term Bigfoot advocate, so she is no neutral party) did one of the worst possible things to convince scientists: she put out a press release before any peer-reviewed scientific publication of results. This always makes scientists suspicious, because it is a common strategy among less reputable researchers to get the press to cover substandard or even ridiculous research before scientists could weigh in. Then the red flags kept on coming. Her lab, which mostly does DNA analysis for veterinarians, was [given an \"F\" rating with the Better Business Bureau](https://www.researchgate.net/post/Melba_Ketchums_Bigfoot_DNA_study--the_ethics_of_skipping_peer-review_for_monetary_gain). When the paper finally appeared, it was not in a peer-reviewed journal that scientists trust, but in some unknown source called [DeNovo Scientific Journal](http://www.advancedsciencefoundation.org/#!journals/c10d6). It was the only paper in this online journal, another suspicious aspect of the research. And it took only a little bit of digging to find out that that [Melba Ketchum had bought the journal itself ](https://www.researchgate.net/post/Melba_Ketchums_Bigfoot_DNA_study--the_ethics_of_skipping_peer-review_for_monetary_gain)and had no independent editorial board, so the research was completely self-published with no neutral peer review or quality control. Even Bigfoot advocate [Jeff Meldrum found this suspicious](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/19/bigfoot-dna-controversy-science-journal_n_2711676.html): \"To make an end-run around the process by erecting a facade in the form of a so-called new journal and allege that it is edited and reviewed, without providing any of that information on the public web page, it appears that she has undertaken an effort to self-publish, just to get it out there,\" Meldrum told The Huffington Post. \"And, to boot, she's charging $30 a pop for a copy of the paper. Meldrum said he doesn't think any credible scientific journal would shy away from the topic simply because of its controversial nature. \"I wouldn't rule it out entirely. There are certainly politics involved in the selection of papers. If it's solid work, this is the discovery of the century, if not the millennium,\" Meldrum said. \"Any journal, if they were confident in the results and in the expertise of their reviewers, and it came down positive \u2014I would think they would clamor for the opportunity to have that on the front cover of their journal.\" Throughout the long wait for the paper to appear, rumors were flying. There were [lots of conflicting stories](http://doubtfulnews.com/2012/12/where-is-the-ketchum-bigfoot-dna-study-reviewed-rejected-or-russia/) about whether it was under review or not, and a Russian co-author leaked all sorts of information that was not consistent with what Ketchum's lab was saying. The press release and other announcements claimed that all the mitochondrial DNA was human (no surprise), and [come from normal human hair which has mitochondrial DNA but no nuclear DNA](http://www.skepticblog.org/2012/11/26/bigfoot-dna/). The [nuclear DNA largely matches human samples as well, along with an \"unknown component\" ](http://www.skepticblog.org/2012/11/26/bigfoot-dna/)that Ketchum prematurely attributes to Bigfoot. As our own [Steve Novella put it](http://www.skepticblog.org/2012/11/26/bigfoot-dna/): Let me offer a preliminary alternate hypothesis. The hair samples that contain only human mtDNA are from a human. The samples from which the nuDNA is isolated are also from humans but with some contaminants or some other animal source mixed in. That seems to be a more parsimonious interpretation. I would like to know more about the source of the DNA, but I guess that will have to wait for the full details to be published. The fact that the human DNA is modern human (hence the need for the alleged hybridization to have occurred so recently in the past) is most easily explained as the source simply being modern humans. Let us also consider the scenario that Ketchum is suggesting\u2014in the very recent past (less than 15,000 years) an unknown primate bred with modern human females (mtDNA comes almost exclusively from the female line) producing the creature we now know as bigfoot. What, then, must the original unknown primate looked like? The result of this pairing then produced fertile offspring, enough to generate a new stable population of bigfeet. It is highly doubtful that the offspring of a creature that looks like bigfoot and a human would be fertile. They would almost certainly be as sterile as mules. Humans could not breed with our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees, or any living ape. It is probable that we could produce fertile young with Neanderthals, but it gets doubtful the further back in our evolutionary history we go - and how far back would we have to go to reach a common ancestor with bigfoot? The bottom line is this\u2014human DNA plus some anomalies or unknowns does not equal an impossible human-ape hybrid. It equals human DNA plus some anomalies. One of the first people to get an advance peek at the paper, [geneticist John Timmer of the online journal Ars Technica,](http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/02/bigfoot-genome-paper-conclusively-proves-that-sasquatch-is-real/) reported: At this point, we get into some actual biology with enough details to analyze. And the details appear to point in the exact opposite direction of the authors' conclusions that bigfoot represents a recent hybridization between modern humans and an unknown species of primate. To begin with, the mitochondrial DNA of the samples (when it can be isolated) clusters with that of modern humans. That isn't itself a problem if we assume that those doing the interbreeding were human females, but the DNA sequences come from a variety of different humans\u201416 in total. And most of these were \"European or Middle Eastern in origin\" with a few \"African and American Indian haplotypes.\" Given the timing of the interbreeding, we should only be seeing Native American sequences here. The authors speculate that some humans may have walked across the ice through Greenland during the last glaciation, but there's absolutely no evidence for that. The best explanation here is contamination.As far as the nuclear genome is concerned, the results are a mess. Sometimes the tests picked up human DNA. Other times, they didn't. Sometimes the tests failed entirely. The products of the DNA amplifications performed on the samples look about like what you'd expect when the reaction didn't amplify the intended sequence. And electron micrographs of the DNA isolated from these samples show patches of double- and single-stranded DNA intermixed. This is what you might expect if two distantly related species had their DNA mixed\u2014the protein-coding sequences would hybridize, and the intervening sections wouldn't. All of this suggests modern human DNA intermingled with some other contaminant. When the paper was finally available, it was [accessible only behind a paywall that had a $30 charge for ](http://www.advancedsciencefoundation.org/#!journals/c10d6)one paper. It is common in these commercial journals to charge a small amount for an individual paper, but a fee this large, going directly to the pockets of the author who owns the journal, suggests that she was milking the site for money from dedicated Bigfoot believers, and discouraging most scientists (who are not interested enough in the issue to waste $30) from accessing it. [Others have suggested](https://www.researchgate.net/post/Melba_Ketchums_Bigfoot_DNA_study--the_ethics_of_skipping_peer-review_for_monetary_gain) that since her company got the \"F\" ranking from Better Business Bureau and is tanking, she dreamed the whole thing up as a scheme to raise money from the Bigfooters. I finally got a look at the paper for myself. Most of it reads like a conventional DNA paper, and the results don't look that oddball since they are presented in a normal fashion. (By contrast, many crackpot papers have bizarre writing and structure, often presented in a weird font like Comic Sans). There is a section claiming that they eliminated questionable hair samples by comparing their samples to reference samples of hairs of humans and other common North American mammals. Only hairs which had a \"novel visual structure\" (p. 3) were said to have been used in the study. Then there were other samples that included \"toenail, tissue, blood, mucus, scratched tree bark and saliva claimed by submitters to be from an unknown and previously undescribed hominin\". They came from 14 states and 2 Canadian provinces. \"Samples were subjected to a preliminary screening by utilizing eyewitness interview information, visual and histological examination, and DNA testing.\" What?? This is the key issue that screams out for further investigation. Her samples were collected by people who claimed to witness Bigfoot, yet there is no identification of the source, where it came from, and how they know it came from Bigfoot\u2014an inexcusable gap in the essential data allowing us to assess the reliability of the collecting procedures. More significantly, not one of them was able to get a photograph of Bigfoot as it left tissues behind. I find that very hard to believe in a day when nearly everyone carries a cell phone camera in their pocket. Surely a photo would provide much more convincing evidence that the sample allegedly derived from Bigfoot. There are accounts of how the \"blood sample\" was obtained when Bigfoot cut its lip sucking on a sharp rain gutter. If the witness saw that much up close, why are there no pictures? This doesn't give us any confidence that these \"eyewitnesses\" actually saw a Bigfoot leave the sample behind. Instead, it suggests that sampling is much less rigorous and second-hand, as indicated by the [story](http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/sideshow/scientist-claims-sequenced-bigfoot-dna-190947582.html) that some of her samples came from a blueberry bagel left out in a Michigan back yard that is claimed to be frequented by Bigfoot. This [xkcd cartoon](http://xkcd.com/1235/) says it all: And this begs an even larger question: if we have an unknown DNA sample, how do we know it's from Bigfoot? We cannot just assume that if it doesn't come from a known North American mammal, it's automatically from Bigfoot. Without already having Bigfoot in captivity to sample from, all we can say about an unknown DNA sample is that it's from an unknown source! This a common problem with cryptozoologists and pseudoscientists: if there is some phenomenon that is not yet easily explained by science, they assume that it must be caused by Bigfoot or ghosts or UFOs or some other supernatural cause. The proper scientific assumption is that if the cause is not yet known, we don't jump to supernatural conclusions\u2014we just don't know the cause yet. Well, the verdict is in. Ketchum sent reporter Eric Berger of The Houston Chronicle her samples so he could get them tested by a reputable independent geneticist. [The result? ](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/36302/title/-Bigfoot--Samples-Yield-Opossum-DNA/)Mostly just regular human DNA, with contamination by a number of critters, including an opossum! Ketchum describes her lab procedures in detail in the paper, and claims she had samples of other North American mammals to rule out their input. Apparently she forgot to include one of the most widespread mammals in all of North America, Didelphis virginiana\u2014the American opossum. Geneticist John Timmer of done a post-mortem ](http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/07/an-honest-attempt-to-understand-the-bigfoot-genome-and-the-woman-who-created-it/3/)on the entire Bigfoot DNA fiasco. He dissects what went wrong with her methods, her analysis, and her interpretation of the results. It all boils down to the fact that Ketchum was a \"true believer\" who wanted to find Bigfoot DNA so much that it distorted her perspective and she overlooked huge problems in the sampling, in the lab techniques, and in the obvious implications of the results. She was utterly convinced that the samples were not contaminated, yet in her methods section she admits to screening out hairs and other tissues that were from non-hominin mammals. Again and again, she got warning signs that the samples were contaminated, that most of the DNA was just from modern humans. It was clear that there was a mixture of a bunch of North American mammals in it that she refused to think about, but she let the software blindly crunch the DNA sequences without throwing other mammals in the mix, and so on. Especially when she got the mix of both single and double-stranded DNA, she should have known she had a lot of different mammals in the sample. As Timmer explains, she was so sure it had to be Bigfoot DNA that every contradiction or warning sign was completely ignored, and she constructed a bizarrely implausible story about Bigfeet interbreeding with humans only 13,000 years ago. It was also clear that this type of analysis was beyond the level of training and competence of a person like Ketchum. As Timmer and several others have explained, she jumped to the wrong conclusions or used the wrong methods when she encountered results that were not in her background or training. As Richard Feynman said, \"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.\" I can just see the gags and cartoons out there now: Bigfoot in the \"opossum death pose\"; Bigfoot hanging upside down from a tree like an opossum....

How to Think Like a Skeptic by Harriet Hall, M.D., the SkepDoc In his first book, [On Being Certain: Believing You Are Right Even When You're Wrong](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/031254152X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=031254152X&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20), neurologist Robert Burton showed that our certainty that we are right has nothing to do with how right we are. He explained how brain mechanisms can make us feel even more confident about false beliefs than about true ones. Now, in a new book, [A Skeptic's Guide to the Mind: What Neuroscience Can and Cannot Tell Us About Ourselves](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250001854/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1250001854&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20), he investigates the larger question of how a brain creates a mind. There is no alternative to the scientific method for studying the physical world, but Burton thinks there are essential limitations to science's ability to investigate conundrums like consciousness and free will. Brain scientists fall into error because, he says, \"our brains possess involuntary mechanisms that make unbiased thought impossible yet create the illusion that we are rational creatures capable of fully understanding the mind created by these same mechanisms.\" Burton has a bone to pick with neuroscientists. They are discovering fascinating information, but their interpretations often go beyond what the data can really tell us. They often draw questionable conclusions from imaging studies that could have other explanations. There is a lot going on in our brains that we're not aware of. Subconscious brain mechanisms are like a gigantic committee. Everything from your DNA to your past experiences to your political leanings to your emotions is given a vote, and only the consensus is passed on to your conscious awareness. If all the raw input to the committee were accessible to consciousness, it would be too much information and would hopelessly impair our ability to act. For the mind to function, mental sensations have to override contradictory evidence to create certainty and motivation. The brain tries to make our experiences meaningful by tricks like re-ordering the temporal sequence of events. When the batter swings, he thinks he is seeing the ball and then reacting; but he initiates his swing before he could possibly be consciously aware of the ball's trajectory. Our minds are not truly individual and independent. Burton offers a non-woo-woo view of a \"group mind\" illustrated by exhibits from slime molds and locusts. We are subject to peer pressure and groupthink. Even the perception of visual illusions varies across cultures, and psychological studies may be misleading because 96% of behavioral science experiment subjects are from Western industrialized countries. We have studied neurons because they are easier to study and are believed to be the basis of cognition. But glial cells are at least as numerous as neurons, and they may be vital to our understanding of the brain. He questions some high-profile articles to show how good basic science has been used to advance unwarranted claims: \"My goal isn't to refute the observations but to question the degree of confidence in the conclusions.\" Mirror neurons have been offered as an explanation for empathy, but the evidence is not sufficient to infer that. Direct measurement of mirror neurons in humans has never been done, and the monkeys in which mirror neurons were first discovered\u2014Macaques\u2014show next to no empathy in their actions. Burton also questions research into the \"neural correlates of consciousness\" by investigators such as Christof Koch, because the behavior of individual neurons can't explain emergent properties with a higher level of complexity. In an fMRI study, a patient in a persistent vegetative state was asked to imagine herself walking through her house and then to imagine playing tennis. Different patterns were identified on the fMRI scans when she was asked to think about these two different activities. The researchers concluded that she was conscious and was responding to their commands. Burton offers another possible explanation: that some degree of unconscious cognition was occurring without any conscious awareness. The brain mapping project is misguided. One researcher believes his research marks a turning point in human history, and that we will eventually be able to read our memories from our neural circuitry and preserve them after death. Burton is skeptical: \"I cannot imagine a better example of faith-based magical thinking.\" As infants develop into adults, they lose 50% of their neurons. A pruning process creates a more efficient brain. When a new skill is being developed, the volume of relevant parts of the brain increases, but once the skill is learned, brain volume returns to normal. A [2007 article from the Royal Society of England](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/274/1609/453.abstract) criticized 25 years of research on brain size and behavior, saying that while correlation doesn't demonstrate causation, that is how results are invariably interpreted. fMRI studies can show increased blood flow to areas of the brain, but they can't distinguish between psychological and physical causes. In Burton's analogy, if the fMRI lit up when subjects imagined three-legged Martians surfing on a sea of concrete, that wouldn't make the Martians real. Scan findings in patients with fibromyalgia don't prove their pain is \"real\" but may only indicate expectation of pain. As Burton writes: \"Neuroscientists must acknowledge that translations of scientific data into causal explanations about the mind are pure storytelling.\" In physics, the speed of light can be measured without any influence from personal biases. In contrast, scientific data about the mind is filtered through personal perceptions. Burton feels that current neuroscience is teetering on the brink of an era of excess that will not be viewed kindly by history. Instead of speculating about conscious \"free will\", it would make more sense to focus on intention, which may be conscious or unconscious. Elegant studies have shown that brain activity demonstrates unconscious intention before conscious awareness of intent. Burton quotes the psychologist Daniel Wegner: \"The experience of consciously willing a action is not a direct indication that the conscious thought has caused the action.\" Burton provides an overview of the latest research in neuroscience. He covers a wide variety of subjects, including out-of-body experiences, body image disorders (including people who want to have a limb amputated), feelings of causality, the alien hand syndrome, and the Dunning-Kruger effect where incompetent people not only fail to recognize their incompetence but believe they are more competent than those who are really competent (sometimes paraphrased as \"being too stupid to know that they're stupid\"). This is heady stuff. It challenges our preconceptions. It is packed with the results of intriguing scientific experiments that raise more questions than they answer. The committee in my brain passed on a strong \"thumbs up\" vote to week's eSkeptic Apple Founder, Steve Jobs, had more than a knack for convincing anyone that seemingly unrealistic things were possible. In this week's eSkeptic, Michael Shermer discusses how self-deception and a pervasive optimistic bias\u2014Jobs's \"reality distortion field\"\u2014contributed both to his success and his demise. This article appeared in [Skeptic magazine issue 17.4 (2012)](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol17n04.html). The Reality Distortion Field Steve Jobs's Modus Operandi of Ignoring Reality is a Double-edged Sword by Michael Shermer Robert Friedland was a long-haired, sandal-wearing, spiritual-seeking proprietor of an apple farm commune and student at Reed College when he met Steve Jobs in 1972 and introduced the future Apple computer founder to a principle called the \"reality distortion field\" (RDF). Friedland, Jobs recounted to his biographer Walter Isaacson in the 2011 biography [Steve Jobs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451648537/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1451648537&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20) (Simon and Schuster) published shortly after Jobs's death, \"turned me on to a different level of consciousness.\" The feeling was apparently mutual. \"The thing that struck me was his intensity,\" Friedland recalled about Jobs. \"Whatever he was interested in he would generally carry to an irrational extreme.\" Staring, for example. \"One of his numbers was to stare at the person he was talking to,\" Freidland noted. \"He would stare into their fucking eyeballs, ask some question, and would want a response without the other person averting their eyes.\" The reality distortion field was a bubble Jobs lived in that shielded him from the normal fears that held back so many others. \"According to another Reed student and early Apple computer employee named Elizabeth Holmes, \"If he's decided that something should happen, then he's just going to make it happen.\" And the effect was contagious, she continued. \"If you trust him, you can do things.\" Macintosh software designer Bud Tribble agreed: \"In his presence, reality is malleable. He can convince anyone of practically anything. It wears off when he's not around, but it makes it hard to have realistic schedules.\" The origin of the \"reality distortion field\" was the original pilot episode of [Star Trek, \"Menagerie,\"](https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/the-menagerie-part-i/id218818763?i=218936036&ign-mpt=uo%3D4?at=10l6ex) Tribble explained, \"in which the aliens create their own new world through sheer mental force.\" And just as in that episode such power cuts both ways. As Holmes explained: \"It was dangerous to get caught in Steve's distortion field, but it was what led him to actually be able to change reality.\" Another Mac software designer named Andy Hertzfeld expanded on the concept as it was employed by Jobs: \"The reality distortion field was a confounding m\u00e9lange of a charismatic rhetorical style, indomitable will, and eagerness to bend any fact to fit the purpose at hand.\" The first Mac team manager Debi Coleman said Jobs \"reminded me of Rasputin. He laser-beamed in on you and didn't blink. It didn't matter if he was serving purple Kool- Aid. You drank it.\" And yet when the power was properly channeled, \"You did the impossible, because you didn't realize it was impossible.\" The RDF was more than an on the job placebo effect, as Hertzfeld noted: \"Amazingly, the reality distortion field seemed to be effective even if you were acutely aware of it. We would often discuss potential techniques for grounding it, but after a while most of us gave up, accepting it as a force of nature.\" Eventually the phrase was sloganized on T-shirts after Jobs replaced the soft drink sodas in the company fridge with healthy Odwalla organic carrot and orange juices. On the front of the T-shirt it read \"Reality Distortion Field.\" On the back, \"It's in the juice!\" Even Jobs's Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak experienced Jobs's power: \"His reality distortion is when he has an illogical vision of the future, such as telling me that I could design the Breakout game in just a few days. You realize that it can't be true, but he somehow makes it true.\" Jobs himself described it through the words of the White Queen in Lewis Carroll's [Through the Looking Glass](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1453709185/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1453709185&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20): \"Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.\" Some of Jobs's colleagues were less impressed, seeing the RDF as little more than deception. Macintosh graphic designer Bill Atkinson, for example, told Isaacson \"He can deceive himself. It allowed him to con people into believing his vision, because he has personally embraced and internalized it.\" Isaacson qualified the harsh judgment, noting \"But it was in fact a more complex form of dissembling. He would assert something\u2014be it a fact about world history or a recounting of who suggested an idea at a meeting\u2014without even considering the truth. It came from willfully defying reality, not only to others but to himself.\" A deeper explanation for the reality distortion field and its effects may be found in evolutionary theory and in what Robert Trivers calls \"the logic of deceit and self-deception\" in his 2011 book [The Folly of Fools](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465027555/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0465027555&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20) (Basic Books). Here's the logic of how it works: A selfish-gene model of evolution dictates that we should maximize our reproductive success through cunning and deceit. Yet game-theory dynamics shows that if you are aware that other contestants in the game will also be employing similar strategies, it behooves you to feign transparency and honesty and lure them into complacency before you defect and grab the spoils. But if they are like you in anticipating such a shift in strategy they might pull the same trick, which means you must be keenly sensitive to their deceptions and they of yours. Thus we evolved the capacity for deception detection, and this led to an arms race between deception and deception detection. Deception gains a slight edge over deception detection when the interactions are few in number and among strangers, but if you spend enough time with your interlocutors, they may leak their true intent through behavioral tells. As Trivers notes, \"When interactions are anonymous or infrequent, behavioral cues cannot be read against a background of known behavior, so more general attributes of lying must be used.\" He identifies three: (1) Nervousness. \"Because of the negative consequences of being detected, including being aggressed against...people are expected to be more nervous when lying.\" (2) Control. \"In response to concern over appearing nervous...people may exert control, trying to suppress behavior, with possible detectable side effects such as...a planned and rehearsed impression.\" (3) Cognitive load. \"Lying can be cognitively demanding. You must suppress the truth and construct a falsehood that is plausible on its face and...you must tell it in a convincing way and you must remember the story.\" Cognitive load appears to play the biggest role. \"Absent well-rehearsed lies,\" Trivers explains, \"people who are lying have to think too hard, and this causes several effects,\" including over control that leads to blinking and fidgeting less, using fewer hand gestures and longer pauses and higher-pitched voices. As Mr. Lincoln well advised, \"You can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.\" Unless self-deception is involved. If you believe the lie, you are less likely to give off the normal cues of lying that others might perceive, and thus the logic of how deception and deception detection creates self-deception. The reality distortion field is a type of self-deception that Jobs was able to employ to bolster the hopes and dreams of both himself and those around him to push through the normal barriers that hold most of us back when we are forced to suffer the slings and arrows of life's outrageous fortune so that we may take arms against a sea of troubles. To that end, the reality distortion field is also an extreme version of what the psychologist Daniel Kahneman calls a \"pervasive optimistic bias\" in his 2011 Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374533555/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0374533555&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20) (Farrar, Straus and Giroux). \"Most of us view the world as more benign than it really is, our own attributes as more favorable than they truly are, and the goals we adopt as more achievable than they are likely to be,\" Kahneman notes. For example, only 35% of small businesses survive in the U.S., but when surveyed 81 percent of entrepreneurs assessed their odds of success at 70%, and 33% went so far as to put it at 100%! \"One of the benefits of an optimistic temperament is that it encourages persistence in the face of obstacles,\" Kahneman notes. But over-optimism can backfire, making one blind to cues that failure is imminent and it's time to cut your losses and get out. In a research project conducted by Duke University professors who collected 11,600 chief financial officers forecasts and matched them to market outcomes, CFOs \"were grossly overconfident about their ability to forecast the market.\" In point of fact, the correlation between predictions and outcomes was less than zero! And this overconfidence can be costly, Kahneman explains: \"The study of CFOs showed that those who were most confident and optimistic about the S&P index were also overconfident and optimistic about the prospects of their own firm, which went on to take more risk than others.\" Inventors are high risk takers who need a lot of self-confidence to survive the rough and tumble world of creative competition, but in a Canadian study Kahneman cites 47% of inventors participating in the Inventor's Assistance Program in which they paid for objective evaluations of their invention on 37 criteria, \"continued development efforts even after being told that their project was hopeless, and on average these persistent (or obstinate) individuals doubled their initial losses before giving up.\" The key is in the adjectives. Persistence is one thing, obstinance is quite another. In this case, failure may not be an option in the minds of entrepreneurs (and NASA flight directors), but it is all too frequent in reality, which is why another bias called \"loss aversion\" is felt by most. The principle of loss aversion dictates that we fear losses twice as much as we look forward to gains. In gambling on the stock market, for example, we should keep loss aversion in mind when we are thinking about selling a losing stock but hesitate because we don't want to feel the pain of a loss. On the other hand, loss aversion can cause some investors to get out during a rough-and-tumble stretch in the stock market, instead of riding it out and cashing in on those big comeback days. And loss aversion is related to another psychological principle in behavioral economics called the endowment effect, where we are more willing to invest in defending what is already ours than we are to take what is someone else's. Dogs, for example, will invest more energy in defending a bone from a challenger than they will in absconding with some other dog's bone. Together, loss aversion and the endowment effect show how evolution has wired us to care more about what we already have than what we might possess. High risk takers such as entrepreneurs seem better able to override the loss aversion emotion, and in moderate doses this can lead to success. Over-optimism to the point of distorting reality can lead one to take unnecessary risks, dangerous risks, and even deadly risks, as we'll see in the case of Jobs. Jobs's optimistic bias was off the charts. According to Isaacson, \"At the root of the reality distortion was Jobs's belief that the rules didn't apply to him. He had the sense that he was special, a chosen one, an enlightened one.\" Andy Hertzfeld added: \"He thinks there are a few people who are special\u2014people like Einstein and Gandhi and the gurus he met in India\u2014and he's one of them. Once he even hinted to me that he was enlightened. It's almost like Nietzche,\" referencing the German philosopher's concept of power\" from [Thus Spoke Zarathustra](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1613823061/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1613823061&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20): \"The spirit now wills his own will, and he who had been lost to the world now conquers the world.\" Jobs's self-importance and will to power over rules that applied only to others were reflected in numerous ways: legal (parking in handicapped spaces, driving without a license plate), moral (accusing Microsoft of ripping off Apple when both took from Xerox the idea of the mouse and the graphical user interface), personal (refusing to acknowledge paternity of his daughter Lisa even after an irrefutable paternity test), and practical (besting resource-heavy giants IBM and Xerox in the computer market with a fraction of their budgets). Jobs's RDF unquestionably contributed to his success in revolutionizing no fewer than six industries: personal computers, animated films, digital music, cell phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. He started a business in his parents' garage that became the world's most valuable company. He changed the world, and to that end his reality distortion field served him well. There was, however, one reality his distortion field could not bend to his will: cancer. In 2003 Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, which further tests revealed to be an islet cell or pancreatic neuroendrocrine tumor that is treatable with surgical removal, which Jobs refused. \"I really didn't want them to open up my body, so I tried to see if a few other things would work,\" he later admitted to Isaacson with regret. Those other things included consuming large quantities of carrot and fruit juices, fasting, bowel cleansings, hydrotherapy, acupuncture and herbal remedies, a vegan diet, and, says Isaacson, \"a few other treatments he found on the Internet or by consulting people around the country, including a psychic.\" They didn't work, and in the process we find the alternative medicine question, \"What's the harm?,\" answered in the form of an irreplaceable loss to humanity. Out of this heroic tragedy a lesson emerges\u2014reality must take precedence over willful optimism, for nature cannot be distorted.

Junior Skeptic: Dark Secrets of Oracle-Monger, AMERICAN COLUMN ON MICHAELSHERMER.COM Gods of the Gaps In Michael Shermer's July 2013 'Skeptic' column for Scientific American, he explores the notion that extraterrestrial intelligences visited Earth in the distant past, and reminds us that arguments of divine intervention\u2014alien or otherwise\u2014start with ignorance. About this week's eSkeptic Where did we get our ideas about being attacked from \"outside\"\u2014from other lands, or from outer space? How has this idea been expressed in stories? How do exotic species here on Earth \"invade\" new regions? Can life forms from one planet really invade another? In this week's eSkeptic, we present a bit of fun from the current issue of [Junior Skeptic](https://www.skeptic.com/junior_skeptic/) entitled Alien Invaders!

You'll find this issue of Junior Skeptic in our current issue of Skeptic magazine (18.2), available in [digital](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/app) versions now. [Read Daniel Loxton's bio](#Loxton) at the end of the excerpt. Alien Invaders! by Daniel Loxton All living human beings everywhere on Earth belong to the same species, Homo sapiens. Those whose ancestors lived in different parts of the Earth may look or sound different from each other, but in every important way we're the same. People are people. We all have an incredible amount in common with one another. Sadly, one of the many things that humans have in common is a potential for violence. We can be peaceful\u2014trading and negotiating and working together\u2014but we can also be fierce. Sometimes one group of people decides to fight another for things that they want, such as resources or territory. Depending on the size of the groups involved, we may call this \"piracy\" or \"banditry,\" or we may call it \"war.\" It's a sad part of human nature, but it's not unique to us. Other animals make war between groups, including chimpanzees. They're very close relatives to humans, so it's not surprising that chimps share some of our behaviors\u2014cooperative and destructive. (Even animals as distantly related to us as the ants wage war against other nests or invade neighboring territories.) Because humans can sometimes be dangerous, groups of people often distrust or fear strangers. People may feel that those who look or sound different must really be different, deep down. Sometimes people even come to believe that those that seem different must be bad people. This tendency is called \"tribalism\": feeling it is important for those in your own \"tribe\" to be treated with respect, while outsiders can be treated badly. Which brings us to an ancient idea that has long terrified humankind: the fear that the place we live could be invaded by cruel strangers from somewhere else. This has happened often in human history, with armies taking over other lands and displacing or oppressing the people who already lived there. Europeans invaded the New World, to the sorrow of many Native Americans. Even the mighty Roman Empire fell to \"barbarian\" invaders.... Space Age Paranoia With the development of science, humankind began to realize that ours is just one planet among many. We learned that the twinkling stars in the sky are really mighty suns like ours. At the same time, we learned that our own planet was an almost unrecognizably different place at different periods in the distant past. Prehistoric times were like a series of alien worlds, right here on Earth. (\"Alien\" means \"of an extremely different kind\" or \"foreign\" or \"belonging to another place.\") This new knowledge changed the way we told stories about some of our most ancient fears. To express our anxieties about wars and invasions between countries, writers began to imagine invasions of really \"alien\" beings from outer space. For example, the 1897 Martian invasion story The War of the Worlds was a clever new twist on stories that imagined military invasions by other countries, which were a very popular type of fiction at that time. In the 1950s and 60s, UFO legends and science fiction stories were inspired by the Space Age (the period of human exploration of space by astronauts and robotic vehicles) and the Cold War (a long period of military tension and spying between the United States and a then-powerful Communist state called the Soviet Union). Millions worried that a war using unimaginably powerful \"atomic\" (or later, \"nuclear\") bombs could erupt at any moment and devastate the entire globe. Writers and Hollywood filmmakers made good use of these fears of Space Age atomic destruction, producing countless stories about alien invasions. In some, such as Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956) the aliens arrive as an unstoppable conquering military force. In others, such as Invaders from Mars (1953) and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) the aliens invade by stealth, controlling or replacing their human victims\u2014a reflection of American fears about Communist spies. (\"They're already here,\" screams the hero of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. \"You're next!\") And in still other movies, the invaders were atomic monsters created or transformed by radiation. Radiation is a dangerous and terrifying side effect of exploding atomic bombs. Over time, some alien invasion stories came to reflect fears of environmental destruction rather than atomic war. In the television miniseries V (1983) the aliens come to steal the Earth's water (and also, while they're at it, to eat all the humans). But whatever their purpose, alien invaders bring ruin\u2014and take whatever they want in return. Martians Invade the Earth The grandaddy of alien invasion stories is The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells. Published first in installments in a British magazine in 1897 and then collected as a book in 1898, War of the Worlds is a science fiction tale about an attack upon the Earth by merciless invaders from Mars. In the story, tube-shaped spacecraft 90 feet wide crash down in the English countryside. Crowds gather to marvel at these \"meteorites\"\u2014only to learn the truth when the Martians lash out with their devastating \"heat ray.\" Towering, tentacled, three-legged war machines emerge and march across the countryside. Britain's army and navy are no match for these \"vast spiderlike machines, nearly a hundred feet high.\" People can only flee before the terrible Martian weapons\u2014not only the \"flaming death, this invisible, inevitable sword of heat\" but also black clouds of poison gas that the aliens launch against the defenders of London. Realistically told as one survivor's personal eyewitness account, War of the Worlds is a very scary book. It may be over 100 years old, but it is as much a horror story as it is science fiction\u2014a harsh, gruesome tale of panic and destruction and grim survival. As the San Francisco Chronicle said in an 1898 review, Nothing in all literature is more instinct with horror and dread than the advance of these Martians across the peaceful English country... The contrast between the pastoral land and the steel-clad visitors who stalked like giants over the landscape, burning and destroying everything in their path, is so powerful that it can never be blotted from the memory. A lot of the scariness comes from the aliens' ghastly indifference to human life and suffering. Wells described the Martians as \"intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic\" who viewed humans the way \"a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.\" The Martians took no more notice of attempts to communicate or make peace than we would \"of the lowing of a cow.\" Their calm, methodical purpose was simply to wipe out human civilization as efficiently as possible. Yet for all their power, the Martians had no natural defenses against Earth's microscopic bacteria. Without any immunity, Wells wrote, the invaders \"must have begun to rot almost as soon as they arrived.\" In the end, the Martians' own bodies were invaded\u2014and destroyed\u2014by alien germs! Radio Panics In 1938 a young actor named Orson Welles adapted the already-classic H. G. Wells story as a radio play for American audiences. In an extremely realistic radio broadcast, actors portraying news reporters, military commanders, government officials, and scientists told radio listeners that Martians were attacking the United States\u2014and instructed the population of New Jersey and New York City to evacuate. Although the show was introduced as a play, many thousands of people were bewildered or frightened by the performance. Some were terrified. The New York Times reported that 875 people phoned the newspaper in concern. Thousands more called the police, or even fled to the closest police station. Thankfully, it seems no one was seriously hurt in the confusion. The next day, a visibly shaken Orson Welles told reporters, It came, of course, as a great shock to us that the old H. G. Wells fantasy, a classic original for so many adventure stories, romances, and even comic strips should have had so profound an effect upon radio listeners. The invasion by mythical monsters from the planet Mars seemed to us to be clearly in the realm of the fairy tale. Deeply regretful that this is not so. A 1949 Spanish-language version of Orson Welles' radio play ended in greater sorrow. Broadcast in the capital city of Ecuador, it caused not only widespread panic, but also a savage riot. An enraged mob burned down the newspaper building where the radio station was located, killing as many as 20 people...

In this week's eSkeptic, Karen Stollznow discusses some of the ideas promoted by body language gurus and cautions that \"reading\" body language may be a superficial and unreliable practice. [Skeptic magazine volume 17, number 1](https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol17n01.html) (2011). Body Language (Don't) Read My Lips by Karen Stollznow \"When you run your hands through your hair like that it makes me think you're flirting with me,\" a colleague once said. Someone's been reading those self-help books about so-called \"Body Language.\" \"Maybe I'm not flirting,\" I replied, \"but instead I'm just getting my hair out of my eyes, or detangling my hair, or it's a nervous habit, or I have dandruff, or I'm readjusting my wig. There are many possible reasons for any action.\" But not everyone believes that. Linguistics, kinesics and semiotics are among the academic disciplines that attempt to observe and describe gesture and other forms of non-verbal communication. On the other hand (excuse the pun), body language is the new age, self-help interpretation of behavior. Body language \"experts\" claim they can \"read\" posture, facial expressions, and other body movements. The theory seems to be that we conceal the truth with language, but we reveal the truth with body language. Experts on reading body language can supposedly decode our thoughts and feelings, disclose innermost desires, unlock the powers of intuition, provide searing insights, expose secrets, and uncover the hidden meanings behind our behavior. Julius Fast, author of the seminal book [Body Language](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0871319829/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0871319829&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20), says: \"Your body doesn't know how to lie. Unconsciously it telegraphs your thoughts as you fold your arms, cross your legs, stand, walk, move your eyes and mouth.\" [1](#note01) Self-proclaimed body language specialists fancy themselves as behavioral scientists, or detectives who see clues in our cues, inspired by Sherlock Holmes and TV shows such as [Lie To Me](https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/lie-to-me-season-3/id395964425?ign-mpt=uo%3D4?at=10l6ex). They are motivational speakers, authors of self-help books, and gossipmongers of tabloids and the talk show circuit. They analyze photographs of celebrities to supposedly decipher personality traits, to guess who's in bed with whom, and predict who's dumping whom. They interpret footage of political debates, speeches and interviews, to uncover underlying meaning and detect deception. With the help of these body language experts, you can be a success. Buy their books, attend their seminars, follow their programs, systems and methods and you too can harness these techniques to achieve your goals. They will provide you with the tools you need to give you confidence, to catch a liar in the act, to ace that job interview, to attract love, and to stop sending out those \"wrong messages\". Some fear that body language is so accurate that reading people's behavior is an invasion of privacy, or a type of unethical manipulation. Proponents of body language theories claim there is standardized meaning in the way you sit, stand and walk, how you shake hands and lick your lips, or even run your hands through your hair. Like a visual polygraph test, they believe that answering a question and touching your nose a certain way, or an involuntary subtle shift in your eye, betrays a lie. Crossing your arms indicates defensiveness, or a lack of openness, while rubbing the stem of a wine glass suggests that subconsciously, you want to rub something (or someone) else. Body language gurus promote the use of their techniques in conjunction with other alternative therapies. Allan and Barbara Pease, \"Mr. and Mrs. Body Language,\" are authors of the \"communication bible,\" [The Definitive Book of Body Language](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553804723/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0553804723&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20). [2](#note02) They recommend the supplementary use of Neuro-Linguistic Programming techniques. Elizabeth Kuhnke, author of [Body Language for Dummies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119953510/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1119953510&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20), uses body language in conjunction with chromotherapy (i.e., color therapy). [3](#note03) Shelly Hagen adopts principles of Feng Shui; \"Cashmere and cotton, for example, are soft and inviting, suggesting that the wearer is a gentle soul. Hard materials, like leather or boiled wool, keep others at a distance.\" [4](#note04) Some followers believe that body language can do more than reveal if someone is sexually attracted to us. Bioenergetic Analysis is a form of body psychotherapy, pioneered by Alexander Lowen and John Pierrakos. Bioenergetic therapists read posture, gestures and expressions to diagnose their clients, and treat them using exercise, movement and vocal expression. Proponents of Bioenergetic Analysis claim that body language techniques can heal conditions such as anxiety and depression, and even cure cancer. [5](#note05) Like infomercials that claim we only use 10% of our brains, body language theory claims that only 10% (or 15%, or 20% or 50%) of our communication is verbal. I once taught a course in Verbal and Nonverbal Communication and was expected to teach that human communication consists of 93% body language and 7% language. There has been much research on this topic, but no study has categorically proven there is a precise ratio of verbal to nonverbal communication. This myth seems to have its basis in a study by Albert Mehrabian, who studied the typical responses of people when communicating their feelings and attitudes. [6](#note06) John Borg, author of [Body Language: 7 Easy Lessons to Master the Silent Language](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0137002602/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0137002602&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20) [7](#note07) and other writers generalized these findings to all communication, and created this unscientific sound bite. Books about body language are full of anecdotes and hype. They include references to authors who support their theories, but no citations to the studies. Their claims, theories and models are unsupported by evidence. They invoke the names of legitimate scholars and irrelevant research to validate the practice. For example, Charles Darwin's [The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0814720641/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0814720641&linkCode=as2&tag=skepticcom20-20) addresses the importance of gesture and sign language, and suggests that gestures are relevant to the origins of language. [8](#note08) Books about body language seize this reference, but they misinterpret and overextend Darwin's arguments. Many body language advocates believe in the universality of gestures, behavior and expressions. Tonya Reiman of Body Language University has developed the Reiman Rapport Method, a \"ten step process to master universally pleasing body language.\" [9](#note09) Dr. Paul Ekman has conducted extensive research into classifying human facial expressions. He claims that a small range of expressions, such as those indicating anger and happiness, are biologically universal to all humans. Yet Amrozi, the Indonesian terrorist known as the \"Smiling Bomber\" demonstrated that a smile can also signal confidence and defiance. There are immense differences in expressions, habits, behaviors and customs across cultures and individuals. In a study of behavioral cues, Ekman now claims he has discovered 29 \"wizards\"; subjects he claims are \"geniuses of lie detection.\" [10](#note10) His findings have led to the use of behavior-detection officers by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), in the Screening Passengers by Observation Technique (SPOT) program. However, TSA's SPOT methodology isn't supported by scientific evidence; nor is Ekman's work in this study. A group of independent researchers who examined Ekman's research concluded: \"Analyses reveal that chance can explain results that the authors attribute to wizardry.\" [11](#note11) Moreover, Ekman's recent research is not peer-reviewed. He stated he doesn't publish his findings anymore because enemies of the United States follow his work closely. [12](#note12) I do not dispute the idea that nonverbal actions carry meaning, or that we are receptive to nonverbal communication. But there is no formula for understanding behavior, and every act has numerous potential meanings and causes. Our \"body language\" is subject to context, intent and interpretation. It is influenced by culture and socialization and differs at the individual level. Reading body language is simply the subjective interpretation of the observer, and is open to misinterpretation and misunderstanding. The analogy to \"reading\" is helpful. Interpreting body language is a kind of cold reading, or a form of body divination to predict thought. The claims in books about body language show that reading behavior is a superficial and unreliable practice. It is potentially risky too. So be careful the next time you approach the woman who seems to be looking at you and stroking the stem of her wine glass. You might just get that wine thrown in your face.
