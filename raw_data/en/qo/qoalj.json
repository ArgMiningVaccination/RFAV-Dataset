Course description This course is a continuation of MEDS530B; it covers the basics of human anatomy (gross anatomy, histology), physiology (cellular physiology and different organ system areas) and pathology (general, systemic and cellular pathology). We will review the structure, function and diseases of the major organ systems of the human body, with an overview of disease prevention and laboratory simulation of case studies for every organ systems. The course is oriented to pre-medical and health professional related students. Course Objectives Upon completion of this course, students should be able to: -Utilize the appropriate anatomical terminology when referring to the human bpdy. - Recognize anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology of the blood, heart and circulatory system, immune and lymph system, digestive system, respiratory system, urinary, and reproductive systems, and deal with different case studies, and identify symptoms, required pre-tests, confirmatory tests, and pathological conditions for these systems, and explain the behavioral ways for disease prevention. - Apply computer simulation to understand structure and functions of the organ systems covered in the course. -Integrate information from current clinical literature with basic anatomical concepts and how they relate to the normal or disease state. Course Structure Lectures Students are responsible for all topics and issues discussed in the lectures, even if they are not covered in the textbook. All lectures will be posted on blackboard at least one day before the lecture day. 2 Presentations assignments 20% One or two presentations of diseases will be assigned to each student at the beginning of the semester. Students will discuss signs and symptoms; other diseases that produce the same symptoms, risk factors, and diagnostic based on pre and post confirmatory tests, prevention method and therapeutic plan for that particular disease. Students can use different resources (Internet, literature, videos, etc.) to do the assignment. Questions about each of the presentation will be included in the final exam. Homework & Online Laboratories Will account for 10% of the final semester grade. Each student is responsible for completion of his/her own assignment/s and submission by the assign due day and time. Late assignments will not be accepted.

Session 30: Final Week of 12/11-18 (TBA) 6 Students with Disabilities Any student requesting academic accommodations based on a disability is required to register with Disability Services and Programs (DSP) each semester. A letter of verification for approved accommodations can be obtained from DSP. Please be certain the letter is delivered to the instructor as early in the semester as possible. DSP is located in on the University Park campus in STU 301 and is open 8:30 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. The phone number is (213) 740-0776. Statement on Academic Integrity USC seeks to maintain an optimal learning environment. General principles of academic honesty include the concept of respect for the intellectual property of others, the expectation that individual work will be submitted unless otherwise allowed by an instructor, and the obligations both to protect one's own academic work from misuse by others as well as to avoid using another's work as one's own. All students are expected to understand and abide by these principles. Scampus, the Student Guidebook, contains the Student Conduct Code in Section 11.00, while the recommended sanctions are located in Appendix A: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publicationis/SCAMPUS/gov/ Students will be referred to the Office of Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards for further review, should there by a suspicious of academic dishonesty.
