PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMA RY What is the question? The question is: What is the relationship between dietary patterns consumed during lactation and postpartum weight loss? What is the answer to the question? Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship between dietary patterns during lactation and postpartum weight loss. Why was this question asked? This important public health question was identified by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Healt h and Human Services (HHS) to be examined by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. How was this question answered? The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, Pregnancy and Lac tation Subcommittee conducted a systematic review to answer this question with support from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team. Dietary patterns were defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. Diets based on macronutrient distribution were examined when at least one macronutrient proportion was outside of the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR) for carbohydrate, fat, and/or protein, whether or not the foods/food groups consumed were provided. What is the population of interest? The pop ulation of interest i s generally healthy , lactating women. What evidence was found? This systematic review includes one randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in the U.S. , which compared postpartum weight loss between lactating women who were randomized to a Mediterranean -style diet vs. the USDA MyPyramid diet. There were no significant differences in postpartum weight loss between the two groups. There were notable limitations in this study, including a large number of participants dropping out of the study , issues with how the study was conducted , and participants and researchers being aware of the diet received . How up -to-date is this systematic review? This review searched for studies from January 2000 to November 2019. 9 TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background This important public health question was identified by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) to be examined by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, Pregnancy and Lactation Subcommittee conducted a systematic review to answer this question with support from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Revie w (NESR) team. The goal of this systematic review was to examine the following question: What is the relationship between dietary patterns consumed during lactation and postpartum weight loss? Conclusion statement and g rade Insufficient evidence is availab le to determine the relationship between dietary patterns during lactation and postpartum weight loss. ( Grade: Grade not assignable ) Methods A literature search was conducted using four databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and CINAHL ) to identify articles that evaluated the intervention or exposure of dietary pattern s during lactation and the outcome of postpartum weight loss, defined as change in weight from baseline (postpartum) to a later time point during the postpartum period. Pos tpartum weight retention was also considered as an outcome when gestational weight gain was accounted for . A manual search was conducted to identify articles that may not have been included in the electronic databases searched. Articles were screened by tw o NESR analysts independently for inclusion based on pre -determined criteria . Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted for each included study, and both were checked for accuracy. The Committee q ualitatively synthesized the body of evidence to inform development of a conclusion statement(s), and graded the strength of evidence using pre -established criteria for risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and generalizability. Summary of the evidence This systematic review includes one randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in the U.S. , which compared postpartum weight loss (PPWL) between lactating women who were randomized to a Me diterranean -style diet vs. the USDA MyPyramid diet. The two groups showed no signi ficant differences in PPWL. This study had notable limitations, including high attrition (approximately 21 percent), issues with implementation of the intervention , and lack of blinding of participants and investigators . 10 FULL REVIEW Systematic review que stion What is the relationship between dietary patterns consumed during lactation and postpartum weight loss? Conclusion statement and g rade Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship between dietary patterns during lactation and postpartum weight loss . (Grade: Grade not assignable ) Summar y of the e vidence This systematic review includes one randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in the U.S. ,1 which compared postpartum weight loss (PPWL) between lactating women who were randomized to a Mediterranean -style diet vs. the USDA MyPyramid diet. The two groups showed no significant differences in PPWL. This study had notable limitations, including high attrition (approximately 21 percent), issues with implementation of the intervention , and lack of blinding of participants and investigators . Descrip tion of the evidence The search included articles from countries categorized as high or very high on the Human Development Index (HDI)ii and pub lished from January 2000 to November 2019. Studies considered in this body of evidence included women who were ge nerally healthy and feeding human milk exclusively or partially at the time of the intervention/exposure. This systematic review considered the following study designs: RCTs , non -randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and nested case -control studies. Dietary pattern was defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they were habitually consumed . At a minimum, there had to be a description of the foods and beverages in the pattern. Dietary patterns may have been measured or derived using a variety of approaches, such as adherence to a priori patterns (indices/scores), data driven patterns (factor or clu ster analysis), reduced rank regression, or other methods, including clinical trials . Studies assessing diets based on macronutrient distributions outside of the AMDR had ii The Human Development classification was based on the Human Development Index (HDI) ranking from the year the study intervention occurred or data were collected (UN Development Program. HDI 1990 -2017 HDRO calculations based on data from UNDESA (2017a), UNESCO Institute for Statistics (2018), United Nations Statistics Division (2018b), World Bank (2018b), Barro and Lee (2016) and IMF (2018). Available from: http://hdr.undp.org/en/data ). If the study did not report the year in which the intervention occurred or data were collected, the HDI classification for the year of publication was applied. HDI values are available from 1980, and then from 1990 to present. If a study was conducted prior to 1990, the HDI classification from 1990 was applied. When a country was not included in the HDI ranking, the current country classification from the World Bank was used instead ( The Wor ld Bank. World Bank country and lending groups. Available from: https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519 -world - country -and-lending -groups) . 11 to include the macronutrient distribution of carbohydrate, fat, and protein of the diet, and include at least one macronutrient outside of the AMDR. Macronutrient percentages of energy outside of the AMDR are as follows: Carbohydrate for all age groups: <45 or >65 percent of energy; Protein for 19 years: <10 or >35 percent of energy; Fat for 19 years: <20 or >35 percent of energy The outcome considered in this review was postpartum weight loss, defined as change in weight from baseline (postpartum) to a later time point during the postpartum period. Postpartum weight retention was als o considered as an outcome when gestational weight gain was accounted for. This systematic review includes one RCT1 that addressed the relationship between dietary patterns during lactation and PPWL among women who were lactating . Dietary patterns The baseline charac teristics and study findings are presented in Table 1. This U.S. - based RCT was designed to assess the effects of a Mediterranean (MED) diet vs. the USDA MyPyramid diet on PPWL. The participants were lactating mothers (approximately 17.5 w eeks postpartu m), predominantly non -Hispanic W hite (approximately 75 percent ) and well -educated, with a mean age of approximately 30 years. Participants had a mean body mass index (BMI) of 27.2 kg/m2 and a self - reported mean pre pregnancy BMI of 25.5 kg/m2. About o ne-fourth (26.2 percent ) of the participants reported supplementing infants with formula at baseline. After a 5 -week washout period, the lactating mothers received dietary education specific to the MED diet or the MyPyramid diet from a registered dietitian : Participants assigned to the MED diet were encouraged to eat a plant -based diet with whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, legumes and nuts, fish and poultry, olive oil, and low -fat dairy products, while limiting the intake of red meat and processe d meats/foods ( 2 serving s per month). Specifically, they were instructed to consume 28 grams per day of walnuts, 1 -2 tablespoons per day of olive oil, 7 servings of fruits and vegetables per day, 6 servings of whole grains per day, and 2 servings of fish per week during the intervention period, while increasing the consumption of legumes. Participants were also encouraged to limit the intake of full -fat dairy products, red meats, processed foods, desserts, and sources of fat in the diet other than olive oil. Participants assigned to the MyPyramid diet were provided general nutrition education, which emphasized healthy eating choices. However, intake of nuts, use of olive oil, and increased intake of fruits and vegetables were de - emphasiz ed in order to differentiate the two diets. Study participants were encouraged to consume their assigned diet for 4 mo nths. One - on-one diet education was provided at baseline and on two other occasions. Diet education was continued via phone calls multipl e times during the study. Body weight was measured at baseline and 4 mo nths, following a standardized protocol. 12 Evidence synthesis This body of evidence included one study1 that assessed the relationship between dietary patterns during lactation and PPWL . The study assessed dietary components at baseline and 4 mo nths and compared the change in score between the groups. There were changes in diet in both groups (i.e. increase in legumes, whole grains, and dairy in MED diet group; and increase in vegetable intake in MyPyramid diet group), compared to their respective baselines. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the change in intake of food groups between the intervention and control groups except for fish intake, which increased significantly more in the MED diet group (p=0.001). Similarly, the authors reported statistic ally significant decrease s in total energy compared to baseline in both the MED diet group ( -251.2 kilocalories per day, p=0.045) and (-437.5 kilocalories per day, p=0.003) . However, it is unclear whether total energy intake was determined using a modified Block food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) or another method. The study compared the change in weight between women randomized to the MED diet and the MyPyramid diet. While both groups experienced a significant decrease in mean weight (kg) when compared to their respective baselines, the change in weight was not significantly different between the intervention and control groups. Women randomized to the MyPyramid diet lost 3.11 + 3.35 kg (weight at 4 mo nths: 69.6 + 13.8 kg) whi le those assigned to the MED diet lost 2.31 + 3.42 kg (weight at 4 mo nths: 72.4 + 17.6 kg). Assessment of the evidenceiii The following conclusion statement was supported by one RCT and was given the grade \"grade not assignable.\" \"Insufficient evidence is ava ilable to determine the relationship between dietary patterns during lactation and postpartum weight loss.\" As outlined and described below, the body of evidence examining dietary patterns during lactation and postpartum weight loss was assessed for the following elements used when grading the strength of evidence . Risk of bias (Table 2): o The study re ported an attrition rate of approximately 21 percent and attributed it to the cessation of human milk feeding (n=11), loss to follow - up (n=7), and 'other reasons' (n=9). However, there were no significant differences in attrition rates between the groups. In the parent studyiv, the author s elaborated on the 'other reasons' for dropping out of the study, iii A detailed description of the methodology used for grading the strength of the evidence is available on the NESR website : https://nesr.usda.gov/2020 -dietary -guidelines -advisory -committee -systematic - reviews and in Part C of the following reference: Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 20 20.

Contemp Clin Trials. 2011;32(4):505 -511. doi:10.1016/j.cct.2011.03.007 13 including disliking the MED diet (n=2), being overwhelmed or too busy (n=2), relocation (n=2), becoming pregnant (n=2), and infant beginning soy formula supplementation (n=1) (Note: In the parent study, using soy - based formula was an exclusion criterion). The authors acknowledged that attrition possibly resulted in sampling bias. Because of the above stated deviations from the intended interventions, this study was treated as a \"per protocol analysis\", rather than an \"intention to treat analysis\". o Regarding formula intake, 26.2 percent of the subjects reported supplementing infants with formula at baseline . The authors noted that there were no differences in changes in maternal body size meas ures over time between formula users and non -formula users . However, in the parent study , the authors reported that those who dropped out were more likely to supplement with formula as compared to completers (57.7 percent vs. 18.8 percent , p<0.001). Given this, the mean weight change in both the groups could have been different had all participants completed the study. o Adherence to the assigned diet was not assessed and the participants were not asked to maintain food diaries or participa te in other group counseling sessions that may have promoted adherence. o Although the study was conducted in lactating women, it is unclear whether human milk feeding habits changed during the study period and if this significantly differed between the int ervention and control groups. o Neither the participants nor the investigators were blinded in this study. o There were differences between the study protocolv and results presented. The protocol stated that body measurements would be taken at 2, 4, 6 and 12 mo nths, but the reported results did not correspond to that time frame. Consistency : Given that this body of evidence included only one study, consistency c ould not be assessed. Directness : The study purpose, to assess the effe ct of dietary patterns (i.e. , MED diet, MyPyramid diet) on body weight in the postpartum period, was in line with the systematic review question. Precision : The study's sample size pr ovided sufficient statistical power to detect a hypothesized difference in weight change, according to an a priori power analysis. Generalizability : This study was conducted among lactating mothers who were mostly non -Hispanic W hite and had a college degr ee. While the study was conducted in the U.S., the generalizability of these findings to the entire U.S. population is questionable. Publication bias is always a concern ; however, with just one included study that showed no relationship between dietary pat terns during lactation and PPWL, publication bias did not seem to be a serious concern in this evidence. v The Mediterranean Diet and Lactation Study: A Diet Study in Lactatin g Women.

Articles on dietary patterns and PPWL and dietary patterns and GWG were searched for and screened together . This was done to leverage the overlap in topical areas and to improve efficiency. After the initial electronic database search (J anuary 2000 -June 2019), an updated search was conducted to also capture macronutrient distribution articles (January 2000 -November 2019). The results of both electronic database searches, after removal of duplicates, were screened independently by two NESR analysts using a step -wise process by reviewing titles, abstracts, and full -texts to determine which articles met the inclusion criteria for each systematic review question depicted in the flow chart. Refer to Table 4 for the rationale for exclusion for each excluded full-text article. A manual search was done to find articles that were not identified when searching the electronic databases; all manually identified articles are also screened to determine whether they meet criteria for inclusion. 30 Figure 2: Flow chart of literature search and screening results 31 Excluded articles The table below lists the articles excluded after full -text screening for the systematic review questions on dietary patterns during lactation and PPWL and dietary patterns during pregnancy and GWG , and includes columns for the categories of inclu sion and exclusion criteria (see Table 3) that studies were excluded based on. At least one reason for exclusion is provided for each article, though this may not reflect all possible reasons for exclusion. Information about articles excluded after title and abstract screening is available upon request. Table 4.
