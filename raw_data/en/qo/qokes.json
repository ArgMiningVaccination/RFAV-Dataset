Healthcare workers will be among the first groups to be eligible to receive the vaccines. To provide timely, accurate, and on-going information, ASHNHA will be distributing a weekly document with updates. LATEST NEWS Two vaccine trials from Pfizer and Moderna have published results reporting 95% and 94.5% effectivity rates, respectively. On Friday, November 20th, Pfizer applied for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), expedited authorization of medical products for the vaccine with the FDA. Safety of COVID vaccines HOW DO WE KNOW THE VACCINE IS SAFE? No steps are being skipped during the clinical trial process for COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine safety checks are in-progress and will continue as long as a vaccine is available. Vaccine safety is complicated and important, and questions are expected and healthy. Safety and efficacy data from COVID-19 vaccine trials will be reviewed by the FDA as well as an independent review board before a vaccine is authorized or approved. 1 The FDA clinical trials test safety and effectiveness in three phases using thousands of volunteers before a vaccine is authorized. Phase I tests for safety in a small number of people. Phase II tests hundreds of people with different characteristics (such as age and health status) and finds the efficacious dose with the fewest adverse effects. Phase III tests tens of thousands of people to assess safety and effectiveness. The FDA also sets rules for making the vaccine and reporting side effects. HOW SAFE ARE THE VACCINES FROM PFIZER AND MODERNA? The companies making the leading vaccine candidates ( Moderna and Pfizer ) have taken the unusual step of releasing their protocols for public review to ensure transparency. For both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, tens of thousands of participants have passed this two month window and neither vaccine has prompted serious or concerning adverse effects 2. 1 https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-dis ease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines 2 https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2022483 ; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2639-4 Vaccine serious adverse effects usually show up from two weeks to two months after a vaccine is administered. It is atypical for vaccines to have long-term adverse effects. 3 Based on published data from Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials of the leading mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates BNT162b1 (Pfizer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna/NIH) adverse side effects were observed in the first week after each dose. After first dose: fatigue, headache, joint pain, chills. After second dose: fatigue, chills, headache, nausea, joint pain, fever. These side effects are all normal/typical of vaccine side effects as the body works to fight the pseudo-virus. These immune reactions seem to correlate with robust immune responses, typically in younger people. Moderna has since said publicly that adverse effects in their Phase 3 trials largely resolved within a 3 day period. IS THE NEW mRNA VACCINE TECHNOLOGY SAFE? mRNA vaccines contain material from the virus that causes COVID-19 that gives our cells instructions for how to make a harmless protein that is unique to the virus. After our cells make copies of the protein, they destroy the genetic material from the vaccine. Our bodies recognize that the protein should not be there and build T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight the virus that causes COVID-19 if we are infected in the future. These vaccines have been developed using mRNA, this could open the door for new ways to create flu, malaria and other vaccines Once authorized or approved, these will be the first vaccines approved using this technology RNA vaccines could be faster and cheaper to produce than traditional vaccines, and an RNA based vaccine is also safer for the patient, as they are not produced using infectious elements 4 mRNA technology will not change your DNA/genetic code MORE INFORMATION: 1.
