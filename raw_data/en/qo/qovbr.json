This book is not about gardening. It is not even about food. It is about knowledge\u2014the knowledge of nature that is the essence of food that delights our palates and nourishes our bodies. This is the critical food-nutrition- nature-culture connection. We brought you this connection in First Food: A Taste of India's Biodiversity in 2013. We said then that food is about biodiversity. We need to know how food diversity is linked to diversity in the biological world. We need to know this so that we value this biodiversity that grows in the wild, in the farms, in the forests and in the lakes and the oceans. Each region of India, and the world, is diverse in its food habits. Each region has its own recipes; it cooks with different ingredients and, it eats differently. If biodiversity disappears we will lose the food wealth on our plates. Food will become impersonal. It will become a sterile package designed for universal size and taste. This is what is happening today as we eat packaged food from plastic boxes. Conservation of this biodiversity, indeed its celebration, requires us to cultivate it on our plates. Otherwise, not only will our food become sterile, but we will also lose nature and the knowledge that links it to food and nutrition. First Food: Culture of Taste brings you many more recipes that make this food- nutrition-nature connection. We are even more certain today that India has the opportunity to be different in its food journey. We do not have to first eat badly and then rediscover healthy and medicinal food that is not filled with toxins. We have a living tradition of healthy food still eaten in our homes. We still cherish diverse cuisines and we still crave for our unique smells and tastes. But knowledge of this diversity is disappearing. It is getting lost because we are losing the holders of that knowledge\u2014our grandmothers and mothers who managed our food and brought to it cuisines that were local and nutritious. It is also getting lost because we do not value their knowledge. Our food is getting \"multinationalised\", industrialised and \"chemicalised\". It is the same anywhere and everywhere. Strangely, this McDonaldisation of food has been peddled as a sign of modernity and prosperity. It has become aspirational. This is not accidental or incidental. The food industry has a game plan, of which we are unwitting participants. Read the excellent account of the food transition in the US, captured in the book, Salt, Sugar and Fat, by New York-based writer Michael Moss. The plot is revealed. As Moss explains, it was in the mid to late fifties when food giants decided that the key word for them to change people's eating habits was \"convenience\". Their obstacle to the \"social transmutation was the army of school teachers and federal outreach workers who insisted on promoting home-cooked meals\". This was a time in the US when the state agriculture departments had Foreword 03-09 Ttile+contents.indd 5 08/12/16 4:42 PM6 | Culture of Taste extension services to teach homemakers the ins and outs of gardening, canning and meal planning with nutrition in mind. Home economics was taught in colleges. This was also a time, when feminist movements were on the rise. Much like tobacco companies, food companies also found this a great platform\u2014women who returned home after a grueling day at work only to find that they had to cook and care for husbands and children. Both industries capitalised on this by promoting \"liberation\" of smoking and not cooking. This was also the time when television was making inroads into homes. Evenings were too precious to \"waste\" on cooking and cleaning. The food industry, explains Moss, made two cunning manoeuvres to draw women into their fold. One, they created their own army of home economics teachers. Bright and fashionable, these women would set up their own cooking contests. By 1957, US multinational General Foods had 60 of these home economists on its payroll. These women worked with the company and promoted its products, pushing the idea of convenience. Two, to compete with home-cooking promoted at the time by a woman called Betty Dickson, who worked with the American Home Economics Association, the industry brought in its own substitute, Betty Crocker. This friendly but sophisticated food icon was created by the advertising department of Washburn Crosby, which later became General Mills, another US food giant. Betty Crocker never slept, says Moss. She became the face of the food mix, which were sold as grand time savers. The age of processed and convenience food had been ushered in, and it took over the American family life. This was not all. According to Moss's research, food industry had another insidious plan. They needed to takeover and destroy the home economics profession. To do this, they funnelled funds\u2014Moss says that in 1957 alone General Foods gave US $288,250 for grants and fellowships to the association of home economics. This partnership led to the gradual reshaping of the organisation so that it became pro- industry. Soon the profession died. In 1959, Time magazine did a long article on convenience foods and sold it as \"modern living\" which was all about \"just heat and serve\". Food had been revolutionised. It was now processed and pre-cooked. Industry had changed our habits, even without our knowing it. It was subliminal. This \"change\" in our food habits has continued. Since the seventies, the food industry has introduced new habits. Again, by design. This happened in the US in the 1970s and beyond. It is happening in our world today, and we do not even know it. Our own instant snacks, often healthier and more nutritious, have vanished. More importantly, it has become fashionable not to eat home-cooked meals. We have never understood that the Indian diet (if I am allowed to generalise) has the hallmarks of the healthy Mediterranean diet. It too is based on eating seasonal, eating local produce and traditional preparations. We had balanced diets. But somewhere along the way, this science of food culture has been 03-09 Ttile+contents.indd 6 08/12/16 4:42 PMCulture of Taste | 7 lost. We cannot blame it all on the food marketers\u2014they will do what they have to do. We have to blame it on our lack of self-pride or self-awareness about what we were doing in our farms, forests and kitchens. We are losing this knowledge because of sheer neglect. In a recent television programme, the anchor asked the young audience in the studio if they loved \"junk food\". All yelled, \"Yes.\" Then he asked if they ate junk food because they were guided by celebrities who endorsed it. All yelled, \"No.\" This only tells me how subtle, indeed subliminal, the marketing drive that is changing our food habits is, and we do not even know it. These foods are rich in sugar, salt and fats, ingredients that are addictive. All these habits have been created. We are the products of the makers of designer food. It is no surprise then that this food is responsible for ill-health across the world. After all, industry is about profit, not health. We have allowed our takeover. Now we need to fight back to reclaim our food and our habits. The only way to do so is to rediscover food as pleasure and be thrilled, not just by its smells and tastes, but also by the knowledge it embodies. This is First Food. Betty Crocker, who captured stores with convenience foods, needs to be reinvented. This time, as someone who captures kitchens with our grandmother's or mother's recipes. We need to look for the seeds, stems, leaves and flowers that would make up our daily food. This might not be easy as the natural habitats of these plants are now covered with concrete. The most biodiverse regions of the country are under threat from industry. We need to create a demand for the biodiversity-rich foods that have served generations before us, and we need to protect the environment where these plants grow. This book, then, is about the rediscovery of knowledge that is not all lost. Many of the plants that make these recipes are still found in our backyards. Or can be grown and harvested for food. It is only when this biodiversity is lived that it will live. Yet many of the plants are difficult to source, many difficult to grow locally. This is a challenge. But First Food is certainly about treasuring this knowledge and creating new knowledge, which brings culinary art to our plates. The aim is to create cuisines that sustain nutrition, nature and livelihoods. It is only when we take control of our food once again that we will have good food. It is the connection of our lives\u2014food-nutrition-nature\u2014that will celebrate the joy of living.

Shaak\u2014the generic term for greens\u2014finds mention in vedic texts and is strongly recommended as a source of satvik (pure) nourishment in Ayurveda. And while the list of vegetables has become limited in urban India today, the varieties of greens consumed in villages across the country are mind-boggling. Let us begin with Jammu and Kashmir. Haak, a variety of spinach with a distinct flavour, is cooked using a minimalist technique. It is cooked in mustard oil, with a pinch of asafoetida, salt, green chillies and dried ginger. Tempered with red chillies, the watery soup is sheer bliss with steamed rice. Karham (knol khol) is cooked similarly. Sochal , commonly known as mallow, is also a green that has many loyal patrons. In Punjab, sarson ka saag is extremely popular, and is normally consumed with makki ki roti. Interestingly, sarson ka saag is a blend of three greens\u2014mustard, spinach and bathua (goosefoot/pigweed). To add a pleasant, pungent touch, radish too is blended. Bathua, once a common vegetable in north India, has become a rarity today. Its scarcity has added to the renewed interest in this vegetable. Bathua is relished in raita and as an interestingly stuffing in paratha. Palak and sarson are cooked differently in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Unlike in Punjab (where it is pur\u00e9ed), it is prepared and served as a dry dish. In Uttarakhand, palak ka kapha has a texture like the saag in Punjab. It is also not uncommon to pair palak with potatoes. Non-vegetarians have long enjoyed delicacies such as saag gosht and murg haryali, both prepared with spinach, mustard leaves or a combination of both. Another popular green is methi (fenugreek). Its bitterness puts some people off, but from Punjab to Bihar, it is cooked with potatoes and peas in clotted cream-based gravy. Dried fenugreek leaves, the aromatic kasuri methi, are used in many recipes\u2014vegetarian and non-vegetarian\u2014to enhance their appeal. In addition, green coriander leaves are used in western India to prepare kothmir ki bhaji and in Kashmir for the peerless dhaniwal korma. In Uttarakhand, palak is prepared as a dry accompani- ment\u2014tapakiya/tinariya \u2014that is served in small quantities with rice and dal and vegetables like gadheri (yam) or kaddu (pumpkin). Leaves of laai, a local variety of mustard, and chaulai (amaranth) are also popular in the hill state. People in remote villages, till a generation ago, used to supplement their diet with green leaves of shishuna (Himalayan nettle) and linguda (a fern variety) collected from the forest. These vegetables are normally consumed by the poor. Till a few years ago, it was common to use a variety of dried green leaves that were out of season. Not just methi and laai, but leaves of muli (radish) were dried for winter use. Another tasty way of using home-processed green leaves was to use them in the form of badi (sun-dried dumplings prepared by mixing the greens with lentil paste). Paptola and naal badi are prepared with paparh (arum) leaves and tender stems. Alas, GREEN FOREVER PUSHPESH PANT LEAVESFIRST FOOD 10-53Leaves.indd 11 08/12/16 4:42 PM12 | Culture of Tastethe practice has become almost extinct. In eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, a number of local greens were traditionally consumed, but most of them are slowly being abandoned. Leaves of hemp (jute/patsan ) is just one such case. In the Malwa region of central India, an exotic speciality is afeem ki sabzi \u2014 vegetable prepared with the leaves of poppy plants. People in West Bengal and Odisha use a great variety of greens leaves as well. In Bengal, poi and leaves of pumpkin plant are popular. Chorchori utilises these greens in generous measure. Dipped in batter, these leaves are deep-fried to prepare bhaja (fritters) in Odisha and no meal, including the legendary prasad offered to Lord Jagannath at Puri, is complete without saag. Any seasonal green can qualify to be included under this category. Often green or dried leaves are cooked with flowers. One such example is neem ki sabzi that is prepared with dried bitter neem (margosa) leaves and buds. The delicacy has many medicinal properties. 10-53Leaves.indd 12 08/12/16 4:43 PMCulture of Taste | 13 In south India and in the coastal belts, greens are mostly stir-fried and mildly cooked because deep cooking destroys nutrients. Cabbage is used mostly for preparing poriyal and is tempered with mustard seeds, urad (black gram) lentils, curry leaves and garnished with freshly grated coconut. A number of pachadhi (prepared by pounding the vegetables) and kachumbar (composed of chopped vegetables) are prepared with whatever greens are available. Both in north and south India, greens are mixed with batter and deep fried to prepare bhajiyas. The practice of cooking green leaves with dals is more popular in south than in the north. Bachali kura pappu is a spinach-laced dal cooked in Kerala, while pesara pappu is a thick lentil soup made with amaranth leaves. Sometimes greens are blended with buttermilk as in the case of thotakur majiga tulusu where amaranth leaves are cooked in thin buttermilk gravy. The same leaves are also used to prepare a stew without the buttermilk. Some green leaves are only used as flavouring agents and pudina (mint) ranks at the top of the heap. Sour gongura (red sorrel) leaves are used as the main ingredient for pickle in Andhra Pradesh. Gongura pulihora is spiced tart rice\u2014a classic recipe from Andhra. Amaranth leaves are also relished when stir fried as vepudu . There are two other leaves that merit mention. Soya is an aromatic leaf of the fennel family that is cooked with potatoes in winters. Green leaves of spring onions are also considered hari sabzi. Nowadays, button mushroom are cooked with spring onions and their leaves, but in the countryside spring onion leaves are cooked and served without any crutches. The same can be said of green leaves of radish, as they are used in salad or for pickling. In other regions, lentils and kadhi (a yogurt-based recipe) are enriched with inclusion of green leaves. Sagpaitha in Awadh is just one such recipe. In recent days there have been some concerns about consuming green leafy vegetables. Those who have high uric acid in their blood should avoid spinach and amaranth as these contain a large amount of oxalic acid. Some are worried about the hidden salt content. With the exception of a small minority, one can enjoy a variety of greens without doubts, as long as you rinse properly. There are also green leaves that are not eaten but contribute significantly to what we cook. Parsi delicacy paatrani maachi, bhappe ilish from Bengal and karimeen polichettu in Kerala are all wrapped in banana leaf before being steamed or pan-grilled. The banana leaf imparts a delicate aroma and subtle flavour of its own to each of these sparkling gems. Turmeric leaves are also used similarly.

Curious to learn more, I found that there is much more to thalkudi. Thalkudi (Centella asiatica ), the Indian pennywort is a perennial herb, commonly found as a weed in sandy or clayey soils of marshy waste places, ditches, river banks and low wet areas. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is native to countries in Asia, including India, China and Malaysia. The plant is characterised by creeping green and reddish green stolons; its leaves are roughly kidney shaped; and its flowers are pink or white in fascicled umbels, meaning the flower stalks arise from a common point. It has different names- thalkudi in | 15 Thalkudi extracts have been used as a brain tonic and to combat stress and depression Malayalam, tholkuri in Bengali, kola in Sinhalese. The tribal and rural people of Odisha use the leaves in saag, curry, chutney, cake, sharbat, herbal tea, and even as an additive to liquor. The tribal groups of Khadia and Mankirdia living in the Similipal Biosphere Reserve call this plant benga saag. The leaves, including petiole, are chopped and added with vegetables like pumpkin, brinjal, tomato and garlic and cooked. It is also consumed as pitha or cheka bhaja \u2014rounded flat cakes prepared by frying the shredded leaves with rice/gram flour and salt. The Dongria Kondh, a tribe in Niyamgiri hills in Rayagada district, call the plant dhuna kucha and cook the leaves with mustard, chilli and prawn, to prepare a curry. Fresh leaves are also added in locally prepared palm liquor called sadapa mada , to enhance its taste. The Kolha and Santhals of Mayurbhanj district call it chakedopaah and prepare a chutney from the leaves and consume it with their morning meal of pakhala or watered rice. Two to three raw leaves per day are said to enhance memory and check the problem of tremors among the elderly. Thalkudi is also used to prepare herbal tea. According to research by S Kormin for Malaysia University, an appreciable amount of phytochemicals such as asiaticoside, madecassoside and polyphenol compounds present in the leaves are a good source of antioxidants. Thalkudi is used as a leafy green in Sri Lankan cuisine too. In Vietnam and Thailand, the leaf is used for salads or to prepare a beverage. In Bangladesh, the leaves are mashed and consumed with rice. In ancient times, thalkudi was used by yogis for meditation. It is said to help develop the crown chakra , the energy centre on the top of the head. It is highly valued in the indigenous system of medicine. Asiaticoside, a glycoside, isolated from this plant, is useful in the treatment of leprosy and tuberculosis, according to The Wealth of India, a book by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. The plant extracts have also been used in Chinese medicine as a brain tonic and to combat stress and depression. It also strengthens the central nervous system. The micronutrients in the extract prevent brain ageing and are effective for improving concentration power and revitalising the brain, according to studies by R H Singh (Biogerontology , 2008) and by M Subathra (Experimental Gerontology , 2005). Pharmacological and clinical trials also reveal that the leaves can change the behaviour of mentally challenged children. Though no negative effects have been reported, it may cause miscarriage if it is consumed during pregnancy. It may raise cholesterol and blood sugar levels, so it should be avoided by diabetics and those with high cholesterol.LEAVESFIRST FOOD 10-53Leaves.indd 15 08/12/16 4:43 Saag | 17 THALKUDI CHUTNEY I N G R E D I E N T S Thalkudi leaves: 200 g Pumpkin: 50 g Brinjal: 50 g Tomato: 1 (optional) Garlic: cloves 1 tsp Salt: to tasteM E T H O D Fry garlic cloves till they turn reddish.

The request is often met with a puzzled look, followed by an answer so brief and off hand, that it is over even before you thought it had begun. When I asked Lamtibai Rathuria of Chapwar village, Din - dori district, Madhya Pradesh, to explain the recipe for cook - ing peepal leaves, she furrowed her brow and replied, \" Khatta daal ke paka lete hain, aur kya? (We cook it with something sour, what else?).\" The strange response probably has to do with the nearly opposite ways in which urbanites and tribal people view food. For urbanites, the joy of food means an elaborate and creative cooking process. We try to dish up something new out of the same old ingredients. Tribal people, on the other hand, cook most of their food in the same way but it never becomes repetitive because nature introduces new foods throughout the year. For tribal people, the thrill of food lies in the knowledge and awareness about picking the right food at the right time. The more the knowledge, the more the variety they can enjoy. Towards the end of March, tender pink leaves appear on the peepal tree (Ficus religiosa ). These heart-shaped leaves are a favourite of the Baiga tribe of Mandla and Dindori districts. Though available for a brief time, the leaves add a variety to the palate. The leaves are tender enough to cook only for a fortnight, after which they become hard. The tribal women make sure their families get to enjoy several meals from these leaves while they are available. Sometimes, as many as five in a day. The delicate leaves and leaf buds are known to cool the body. Consuming five to six meals of peepal leaves during a fortnight is said to protect from the simmering heat and related problems. Peepal leaves, bark and fruits are known to have cura - tive and laxative properties in Ayurveda and folk medi - cine. In book Herbs That Heal: Natural Remedies for Good Health, H K Bakhru writes that peepal leaves are used to treat fever, heart diseases, constipation, dysentery, scrof - ula, mumps and boils. Traditional healer Anantram Shri - mali from Sagar district says that the leaves, bark, roots, fruits and latex of peepal are used to cure as many as 50 different ailments, one of them being sexual debility in both men and women. \"Since there is a peepal tree in every village, it is easily accessible,\" says Shrimali. \"During the spring season, everyone would pick a leaf or two at any time of the day and chew. It is also known to be good for teeth,\" he adds.FICUS RELIGIOSA/PEEPAL DELIGHTFUL ki Bhaji | 21 PEEPAL KI BHAJI I N G R E D I E N T S Tender leaves and buds: as required Tamarind/Indian sorrel flowers: for sourness Salt: to taste Water: as requiredM E T H O D Wash the leaves and boil till soft.

Lip-smacking dishes and snacks are prepared with this leafy vegetable. Also known as mong toi in Vietnam, shaan choi in China and remayong in Malayasia, Malabar spinach quickly creeps along garden hedges or in pots and so is also called vine spinach. Its Basella alba variety has green stems and Basella rubra variety has red stems, making it a beautiful edible landscap - ing vine. Basella is native to tropical southern Asia, and prob -ably originated from India or Indonesia. Malabar spinach is cooked in summers as a substitute for spinach, a winter crop. Indians love their pakoras , or frit - ters, during rainy season when eating spinach is considered a taboo. Spinach grows in the ground and gets contaminated in waterlogged farms. Humidity further causes bacterial and fungal contamination, but Malabar spinach is safe for con - sumption during monsoons. Malabar spinach is also very easy to clean and cook as it grows above the ground level and BASELLA ALBA/POI Dal | 23there is no soil or germ contamination. It is even better if you grow your own. Poi grows well in nearly all kinds of soils, but thrives more in moist, fertile soils which are high in organic matter. The plant is ready for consumption in 35-40 days and the yield is around 150-200 quintals per hectare for a single harvest. It requires consistent moisture to keep the plant from fl owering, which turns the leaves bitter. The plant bears dark blue fruits, which produce a dark red colour. This is used as a natural dye in cosmetics, food and textile industries. Its mature stems are used to thicken soups and gravies. But if not combined well with appropriate seasoning, it can impart a soapy fl avour. Garlic and asafoe-tida pair well with this leafy green. Its fl eshy leaves become sticky when chopped. This is caused by the presence of mucilage, a non-starchy carbohydrate which, when consumed, heals intestinal wounds and fa-cilitates digestion and easy bowel movement. It is the mucilage in Malabar spinach that helps fl ush out excess cho- lesterol from the body. Ayurveda practitioners prescribe its leaves to those suffering from ulcerative colitis and bleeding piles. This apart, Malabar spin-ach is rich in vitamins A, C and B complex (folates, pyridoxin and ribofl avin) and minerals such as potassium, manganese, calcium, and copper. The Basella rubravariety has an additional reservoir of a range of vital carotenoid pigment antioxidants (beta carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin), which are potent antioxidants and help in scavenging free radicals from tissues. A mushy sabzi made with poi saag and yellow pumpkin is a popular Bengali way of eating it. Sometimes, the fl eshy stems are also added to it. Deep yellow-hued pump-kins are more suitable for this recipe as it imparts a sweetness to the dish. Discard the peel if it is too tough, or retain it, if green and fresh. The sabzi is cooked in mustard oil with a tempering of fenugreek seeds, dry red chillies, lots of garlic and some ginger. Cubed pieces of yellow pumpkin are added along with salt, turmeric powder and chopped poi saag. It is covered and allowed to cook in low heat in its own juices. The sabzi is mashed a little after adding lime juice and served as a side dish with dal and rice. Instead of pumpkin, you can use eggplant and bottle gourd. In Uttar Pradesh and Bihar households, a dal recipe with Malabar spinach is a staple during summers and tastes great with boiled rice and stir fried vegetables. It is often consumed with yogurt, as it helps metabolise the minerals and vitamins found in the poi saag better. Very few greens have such an impressive micro nutrient profi le. It is a good antioxidant food that nourishes the skeletal system and improves haemo-globin count. A 60-70g serving is enough to meet the body's requirements of micro nutrients for a day, if used with lentils and other vegetables. Its mature stems are used to thicken soups and gravies.

Every other week my grandmother would collect this plant called mudakkatraan (Cardiospermum halicacabum ) from our untended garden in the village and my father would transport it overnight by train. The bags were much awaited as it meant the green dosa season had begun. At home, the leaves would be crushed into a gooey paste and mixed with the batter to make green dosas. It was a del - icacy, but in most parts of Tamil Nadu, the plant is eaten for its medicinal value\u2014it eases joint pains. The entire creeper is pulled out and the leaves plucked for use. The creeper is so common that no one bothers to cultivate it. It grows along roadsides and in untended gardens, like my grandmother's. Nowadays, the plant is available in powdered form in ayurvedic stores. The powder can also be made at home by sun-drying the leaves and grinding them and can be stored in the refrigerator. Since it does not dissolve in water, the most palatable method of eating it is to swallow a teaspoon of the powder and wash it down with a glass of water. Following this regime, my mother is much better now and does not suffer from joint pains. Besides joint pain, mudakkatraan also has other medicinal uses: the leaf and root are laxatives; they increase the appetite and heal boils and sores. The creeper, commonly called the balloon vine, consid - ered a noxious weed in some countries, is found across the tropics. In Sanskrit the plant is called indiravalli . It belongs to the soap berry family or Sapindaceae. This family includes plants like lychee and maple. A rasam of these leaves is used to ease constipation and gas. Instead of adding the leaves to a recipe, a poultice can be made to bring down inflammation and knee joint pain. To make the poultice, mudakkatraan leaves saut\u00e9ed in castor oil are bound in a piece of cloth. The poultice is use to treat joint pains. Research shows that the extract of this plant protects tissues such as cartilage, tendon and bone. The extract helps to stabilise collagen by inhibiting the enzyme collagenase. This could be the basis for the use of the plant for treating arthritis. Extract of the aerial parts of the plant was found to have analgesic properties which was comparable with morphine and paracetamol. The plant is often used by traditional healers-in Tamil Nadu, healers use mudakkatraan to treat throat infections and headache. The plant can also treat skin disorders. Leaf juice can be used to treat earaches.

LEAVESFIRST FOOD 10-53Leaves.indd 29 08/12/16 PMOne wouldn't think phutka could amount to anything much. Its berries are black and lacklustre and it grows in profusion along the roads and the southern stretch of the Ganga. But it is a culinary favourite, I found this out after conversations with colleagues and seeing a vegetable vendor collecting it from my kitchen garden in Bhagalpur, Bihar. The tender twigs earned her C10-15/kg, she told me. As a botanist, I knew it as Solanum nigrum, a herb related to the familiar potato. Popularly known elsewhere in India as makoi, phutka is available from January until its fruiting season during March and April. The leaves are cooked with oil and salt and served with rice. Mixed saag, with the green leaves of spinach, chaulai and bathua , along with phutka , is very popular in the floodplains of Bhagalpur. The popularity of phutka is not restricted to our country. In Ghana, the unripe green berries are used in soups and stews. In South Africa, the ripe berries are hand picked and made into a runny purple jam. In Greece and Turkey, the leaves are called istinfo and used in a salad known as horta. In Indonesia, the fruit and leaves are eaten as part of a traditional salad called lalapan. Considered as a weed globally, the plant grows profusely in farmland and gardens. Consumption of the leaves and fruits as food is widespread, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia. Though used in many forms, the plant is also poisonous. All parts of it contain toxic glycoalkaloids, including solamargine, solasonine and solanine. The toxins are most concentrated in the unripe green berries. In large doses, it can cause serious ill-effects, but is usually not fatal. The ripe berries, however, cause no harm. According to The Wealth of India , published by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the leaves of phutka are a rich source of vitamin, particularly vitamin C, and its berries are used for relief in fever, diarrhoea and ulcers. The ripe berries are also used to treat eye troubles. The seeds, too, when rubbed on the skin, are said to aid in removing freckles. The medicinal benefits of phutka are well-known among the people of Bhagalpur. The ripe black berries are used to cure constipation and jaundice, and are even said to enhance milk production in lactating women. The fresh extract of the twig is used to treat jaundice in the villages of Bhagalpur.SOLANUM NIGRUM/PHUTKA NOT LIKE OTHER LEAVES AMRITA FOOD 10-53Leaves.indd 31 08/12/16 4:43 PM32 | Culture of Taste 32 Culture of Food 10-53Leaves.indd 32 08/12/16 4:43 PMPhutka Pakauri | 33 PHUTKA PAKAURI I N G R E D I E N T S Boiled phutka leaves: 250 g Gram flour: 1 for frying Salt: to tasteM E T H O D Wash and cut phutka leaves and add to gram flour.

Moringa ( Moringa oleifera ) was the only food that was grown at home, while all other fruits and vegetables were bought from the market. I still thank my mother for inculcating in me the love for the tree through her delicious recipes made from the freshly plucked leaves. Moringa leaves are known by different names\u2014 Bihar or drumstick in English. Raw leaves taste bitter, but the bitterness disappears after cooking. The leaves cook in a few minutes and retain their bright green colour. While the leaves are eaten in all parts of the country, they are more popular in villages. In cities, they are considered infra dig. Neither does the tree find a place in manicured lawns nor do the leaves find a place of pride among the greens. A super food, moringa's curative properties are well documented in Ayurvedic texts. It is said to be used in over 300 Ayurvedic compositions. According to the Nutritive Value of Indian Foods by C Gopalan, moringa leaves have seven times the vitamin C found in oranges, four times the vitamin A in carrots, four times the calcium in milk, three times the potassium in bananas and twice the protein in yogurt. Moringa can also cure anaemia in children. In Africa, people consume moringa leaves to prevent malnutrition. A test conducted in Senegal during 1997-98 showed that children who consumed moringa leaf powder maintained or increased their weight and improved their overall health, while pregnant women delivered babies with higher birth weight and also recovered from anaemia. In India, moringa leaves are not popular as a marketable commodity. Plantation owners sell only the phalli or drumstick. Balasaheb Marale, a drumstick plantation farmer from Maharashtra told me that since the leaves dry quickly, it is not lucrative to sell them. My father, who has good knowledge of the lesser-known uses of plants and vegetables, says it is also due to the brittle nature of the tree, which makes climbing and plucking the leaves difficult. But this is now changing as the leaves have been recognised all over the world as a super food. Some farmers in Andhra Pradesh have gone in for commercial cultivation. Products such as herbal tea and cookies are now marketed. Moringa leaves are being used in innovative ways. They are being used as substitute for spinach or fenugreek leaves, and are also used in pizzas, omelettes and SAMBAR I N G R E D I E N T S Moringa leaves: a handful Tamarind: taste Curry leaves: 1 sprig (optional)M E T H O D Extract the tamarind juice.

During a to Bah Bazar, my aunt's place in Deoprayag, Uttarakhand, I discovered rare delicacies made from a local plant. The twigs with green-white flowers are a common sight on roadsides and in open areas during winters. These are used to make a delicious vegetable dish. Adhatoda vasica is called basinga or basingu in Garhwal and aroosh or adush in Hindi. The best time to collect the leaves and flowers is between December to February. People in Garhwal have always depended on wild sources for food since organised markets are absent. These seasonal vegetables are not sold in the market because of their limited availability. Instead, people mostly barter the plants for daily items of use such as rice. An old lady with a bagful of green leafy edibles would come to my aunt's place every third day to barter almost a kilo of basingu leaves for a bowl of rice. I was told she visted almost seven houses every time to barter seasonal wild vegetables and fruits for food she would have to otherwise buy from the market. My aunt told me, \"Everybody at home, especially the elders, are fond of this vegetable because of the warmth it gives during winters.\"The medicinal properties of basingu have been well known in India and several other countries for thousands of years. It is heavily traded for medicinal purposes by pharmaceutical companies and is prominently used in Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani medicines. Fresh leaves and inflorescence of the plant are traded in herb markets of Ramnagar and Haldwani in Uttarakhand and Khari Baoli in Delhi. Its expectorant property is used in the indigenous system of medicine to cure chest infections. The leaf decoction is used to treat asthma, cough and malaria. It is indigenous to India and distributed all over the plains of India and in the lower Himalayan ranges, ascending to a height of 1,500 m. It has been adopted by modern medical practitioners too. A quinazoline alkaloid, vasicine, is reported in all parts of the plant, the highest being in inflorescence and is responsible for the bitter taste. The leaves are found to activate the digestive enzyme trypsin and are also fed to children suffering from small pox and chicken pox. The bitterness of the plant can be removed by boiling it and then keeping it in a bamboo basket under running water. Though the plant is still common in Garhwal, according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, it is threatened by overexploitation for Ayurvedic and ka Saag | 41 BASINGU KA SAAG I N G R E D I E N T S Basingu leaves: 1 kg Jakhiya seeds: to taste Mustard oil: 1 tbspM E T H O D Take small leaves of basingu and soften them in boiling water for two-three minutes.

For this culinary loss, nature compensates with an appetising gain. Some vegetation, which disappears once it rains, stays on for longer periods. One such vegetable is sarata bhaji (Tribulus terrestris ), which grows mostly on low-lying, rocky lands in drought-prone areas across Asia, America and Europe. It is nature's way of ensuring food security as it grows in abundance at a time when other crops are scarce. But its days are limited to early June when the showers are light and other vegetation is yet to show up. In the drought-prone Yavatmal district of Maharashtra, sarata bhaji is usually available in ample amounts even as late as August. During a visit to Dhangarwadi village with Madhukar Dhas, who heads Yavatmal-based non-profit came across a cluster of sarata bhaji growing on a farm. We forgot work and started plucking the tender shoots. \"Pahile potoba, mag vithoba, (stomach fi rst, god later)\" is Dhas' adage. Born to farm labourers in Marathwada, he was virtually brought up on wild vegetables, and to revive the lost food culture, he has documented around 70 species of wild vegetables consumed by the rural population. Back at Dilasa's fi eld offi ce in Choramba village, Dhas gets busy cooking sarata bhaji. \"This vegetable should not be cooked too long, as it can lose its fl avour,\" he says. Dhas' elderly mother, Shantabai, joins the conversation and says that in the arid Solapur district, where she has lived most of her life, sarata bhaji is a regular part of meals for two to three months. \"It is known to be good for debility, diabetes and rheumatic pain,\" she adds. Ayurveda agrees. But there is more to sarata bhaji. According to the well-known text Bhavaprakash, nighantu gokshur, as the vegetable is known in Sanskrit, removes excess sugar from blood through urine and is excellent for diabetic patients. It is also good for those suffering from body ache, including joint pain and rheumatism. According to the text, sarata bhaji helps prevent kidney stones and heart problems and removes chest congestion. The plant bears fruits covered with deadly spines. Hence, its name, puncture vine. One of its most important functions, perhaps, is to stimulate testosterone, the male sex hormone. Its active ingredient, protodioscin, is a natural precursor of testosterone. The herb can also boost the production of the luteinising hormone, which is a testosterone stimulator. K Gauthaman of the National University of Singapore found that sexual behaviour in rats improved after being administered the extracts of the herb. It is this attribute, perhaps, that accounts for the popularity of Tribulus supplements among sportspersons. The Western world became aware of this herb in the early 1990s after word got out that eastern European countries were giving supplements prepared from this herb to athletes to improve their medal tally in the Olympics. Following this, sportspersons from around the world pounced on it. In later years, research found the herb to also have a hormone regulatory effect. Studies have further linked it to a boost in blood circulation and energy levels. Today, Tribulus supplements are popular among bodybuilders and other athletes who wish to restore their hormone levels to normal after taking testosterone boosters. Usually the fruit is used to make the supplement, but the whole plant has the same properties. Notwithstanding the commercialisation of the herb, it is still best consumed fresh, says Shantabai. Active and fi t at 78, she stands upright and says with a smile, \"All my life I have eaten bajra (pearl millet) and jowar (sorghum) bhakhar and wild vegetables, and look at me now; I am good to run the household for another 20 years.\" Sarata bhaji removes excess sugar from blood through urine.

The Soligas of Karnataka's Male Madeshwara Hills Reserve Forest have an intimate relationship with the forest and have a remarkable knowledge of wild vegetables that grow here. During the rainy season, they collect more than 30 types of leafy vegetables rich in iron and nutrition. Most Soliga households at this time are filled with the aroma of delicious dishes. Kaddisoppu (Jasminum trichotomum ), which belongs to the Oleaceae family, is a shrub which grows abundantly just before the monsoon arrives in this forest area. It is bitter in taste, but rich in iron, magnesium, alkaloids and phytosterols. The Soligas collect kaddisoppu from the forest while gathering fuel-wood or non-timber products, or while grazing cattle. It also grows easily in the farmlands. The tender leaves of kaddisoppu protect the Soligas from monsoon maladies. They have discovered that kaddisoppu is a particularly good medicine for cold, cough and flu. It also works wonders for stomach infections, especially dysentery and stomach ache. Forty-year-old Chikkmadaiah, who lives in Gorasane village near the Male Madeshwara Hills temple, uses the leaves to prepare uppusaru , a green leaf stew pre - pared with garlic and onion, which is eaten with steamed ragi balls. This is a common dish in south Karnataka during the monsoons. Sometimes the leaves are just saut\u00e9ed with a spoonful of oil, garlic, onion and chilli and salt and is con - sumed as a side dish. Cooked with tamarind, uppusaru can also combat stomach infections. A study published in the International Journal of Research in Ayurveda and Pharmacy in 2011 states that the extract of kaddisoppu leaves significantly reduces pain, fever and inflam - mation. Other studies have indicated that the leaves possess antiulcer properties and have an antidiabetic effect. It is not just the medicinal values that the Soligas love about kaddisoppu. They relish its taste as well. The simple uppusaru dish is prepared in almost each Soliga household. The leaves are also stir fried and consumed as a side dish. Puttamma, 60, who also lives in Gorasane village, says, \"Green leaves are a part of our everyday food. We cannot survive without leafy vegetables.\" Fortunately, the Soligas still have legal access to the forest produce.

My botany teacher had intro - duced me to the Himalayan giant nettle, known as Girardinia diversifolia in botanical lexicon, during a study trip to a forest near Narkanda in Himachal Pradesh. Five years later, I came across the plant again in Niti Valley, located along the In - do-China border in Uttarakhand. I was walking through the forest when I felt a stinging pain on my left ankle. My colleague told me that I might have brushed against dhol kanali, as the plant is known in the Garhwal region. The oil glands of its stinging hair contain formic acid, which can cause skin irri - tation. Though my pain subsided within a few hours, some people might need anti-allergy medicine to recover. The nettle, found abundantly in forests, riversides, road - sides, on farm bunds and in degraded patches is, however, a culinary favourite in the hilly areas of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, and even in neighbouring Nepal and Bhutan. Between March and May, people pluck the tender new leaves with an iron tong or after covering their hands with some cloth. The leaves are first exposed to fire to remove insects and disarm the thorns and then washed and boiled before cooking. People in the Kedarnath Valley prepare a dish from its leaves and inflorescence, which tastes like mustard greens. In some areas, people roast its seeds to make a pickle. \"Bichhu ghas is rich in iron. It is good for pregnant women in rural areas who do not have regular access to iron pills,\" Biru Lal of Maikhanda village in Upper Kedar Valley told me. Modern science underscores his wisdom. According to The Wealth of India , a book published by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, leaves of the nettle are also rich in vitamin A. \"Its chemicals, formic acid and histamine, act as anti-inflammatory agents,\" says N S Bisht of H N B Garhwal University in Uttarakhand. Bisht, who has studied bichhu ghas, says consuming a decoction of the roots and basal stem cures malignant boils, gastric prob - lems and constipation, while a decoction of its leaves helps cure fever. Paste prepared from its roots is applied externally to treat wounds, headache and swollen joints. The ash of its leaves is applied externally to treat ringworms and eczema, he adds. Start-ups are also marketing the leaves as tea. Jean Bardot, a scientist at the University of Maryland Medical Centre in the US, terms the plant as \"a super wild food\" for its diuretic, anti-rheumatic and anti-allergic nature. All one has to do is collect its leaves and roots carefully, without getting stung.
