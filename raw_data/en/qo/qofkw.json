The GI is a value between 0- 100, that is assigned to foods containing carbohydrates based on how slowly or quickly that food raises blood glucose levels. Foods with a GI value of 55 or less are considered low GI and tend to release glucose slowly.in the body thereby causing a lower rise in insulin levels. Low GI foods appear to have added benefits such as: promoting weight loss and reducing risk of heart disease and diabetes. Foods with a GI value of 56 -69 are considered mid GI and foods with a GI value of 70 and over are considered high GI. High GI value foods tend to raise blood glucose levels in the body due to the rapid release of glucose. High GI foods can help to correct low blood sugar incidents and help with energy recovery after intensive exercising. Below is a list of common foods and their assigned GI values. Cornflakes FSSA's Division of Aging October 2020 Nutrition and diet and oral health affect one another. What you eat affects the tissues in the mouth while the health of your mouth affects what is consumed. The risk of developing caries increases with the consumption of sugar in the diet, while acidic foods and drinks increase damage to tooth enamel. Oral health issues like cracked and missing teeth, ill -fitting dentures, dry mouth, inflammation in the mouth, etc. affect the foods that are eaten. The American Dental Association 's policy and recommendations on diet and nutrition include \"avoiding a steady diet of foods containing natural and added sugars, processed starches and low pH -level acids as ways to help maintain optimal oral health \". The National Institute on Aging offers the following tips for taking care of your teeth and mouth: see your dentist regularly for cleaning, brush and floss twice a day, use fluoride toothpaste, eat a well -balanced diet, and quit smoking. Suggested foods to help fight plaque buildup: Fruits and vegetables with fiber, dairy products like cheese, milk, and plain yogurt, black and green tea, sugarless chewing gum, and foods with fluoride. Suggested foods to limit that may invite tooth decay: sticky candies and sweets, foods that contain starch that can get stuck between your teeth, carbonated soft drinks, and substances like alcohol that can dry the mouth. If medication use dries out your mouth, talk to your healthcare professional about other options or remedies.
