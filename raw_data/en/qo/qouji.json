Nature and Forest Therapy Public Lands Engagement: Health & Wellness in Nature PAGE 1 Introduction For centuries thought leaders have observed that nature experiences improve the mind, body and soul. In recent decades those intuitions have been confirmed by scienti fic studies that have been done all around the world. But modern lifestyles have removed us from nature. Studies also show that social support helps us to adopt positive behaviors. This report o ffers many opportunities for people to organize, have fun with others , and promote community wellness through contact with trees, parks, gardens and all of nature.\" - Dr. Kathleen Wolf, Ph.D., Social Scientist, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington Purpose To promote spending quality time in nature and green spaces for physical, mental, and spiritual well-being by making the environment more accessible, relatable, relevant, and connected to the daily lives of all Americans. Overview Green spaces make us happier and healthier! The connection between public green spaces and health is not a new idea. Nearly 40 years of scientific research demonstrates that experiences in nature contribute to our health and wellness. A growing body of research indicates that unstructured outdoor activities may improve physical and mental health by increasing physical activity, reducing stress, and serving as a support mechanism. Researchers have found that spending time in the outdoors improves short-term memory, concentration and creativity, while reducing the effects of stress and anxiety. Public Lands Are Go od Medicine Public lands include national parks, forests, as well as local parks and other open green spaces that are managed by federal, state, local, and regional governments\u2014but that belong to and are enjoyed by all of us . From the wa ter we drink, to the air we breathe, and the spaces and climates we live, work, and play in, public lands impact our daily well-being and long term physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health. Public Lands Engagement: Health & Wellness in Nature PAG E 2 Public Lands Engagement Social Equity and Access Community engagement events on public lands to Nature provide a great opportunity for residents to spend Many people, because of lack of access, time with family and friends while enjoying the transportation, or general familiarity, visit parks many benefits that come from connecting with and green space rarely or not at all.

Public Lands Engagement: Health & Wellness in Nature PAGE 5 Messaging the Health Benefits of Nature When introducing health activities at your community engagement event, it is important to ensure participants understand not only what they are doing, but also why. Community engagement events can be a useful avenue for promoting community health messages in addition to teaching the community about the environment. These events can be a great opportunity to encourage participants to create lasting lifestyle changes to incorporate nature and wellness in their daily lives. Carefully crafted messaging can influence behaviors and have a great impact on the health of both individuals and communities. Listed below are scientific evidence that spending time in the outdoors improves health. Share these benefits at the event to reinforce the idea that participants are both having fun and getting healthy! When developing health messages, engage community members to ensure their voices are heard. Create messaging that resonates with your audience and allows individuals to see themselves. Engage trusted messengers whenever possible to share important health information. When developing messages consider language that empowers, appeals to lay audiences, and is clear, to the point, and achievable. Healthy Parks Healthy People Healthy P arks, Healthy People promotes the fact that parks are gateways to good health\u2014for people and the planet.

Children who spend time outdoors experience increased physical activity. Forevery hour a week a child spends outside, their physical activity increases by 27 minutes. Spending at least 120 minutes a week in nature is associated with good health and wellbeing. Children who are regularly exposed to nature have a lower risk of developing myopia, also known as shortsightedness.Physical exercise outdoors reduces blood pressure and improves mood. When individuals exercise outdoors, they experience a greater reduction in blood pressure and improvement in mood thanwhen exercising in indoor settings. Natural environments contain chemical and biological agents that can boost immune functions and promote human health.Public Lands Engagement: Health & Wellness in Nature PAGE 7 Mental Wellness Messaging Nature makes you more creative. Experiencing the wonder of nature can inspire people to solve problems more creatively and cooperatively. Nature has significant restorative properties; it can renew depleted cognitive functions and improve performance. Nature provides a place and an opportunity for play and physical ac tivity. In children, play is critical to development and aids inthe development of cognitive thinking and reasoning skills. Nature encourages exploration and building, which improves problem solving, decision making, and the ability to respond to changing contexts. In adults,incorporating exercise into time in nature can help increase the brain's cognitive capacity. Exposure to nature, even passive experiences such as looking out over a view of nature, can reduce stress levels.For those with high le vels of stress, physical activity in nature can be beneficialfor both physical and mental health.People living near parks and greenspace have less mental distress, are more physically active, and have extended life spans. Especially in children, nature acts as a buffer for stress and can reduce overall stress levels. Contact with nature can provide relief and healing for those who suffer from acute and chronic mental illness, including depression, an xiety, mood disorders, and dementia. Nature can serve as a safe, inexpensive, and widely accessible t ool for managing ADHD symptoms. Time in nature can help heal people with depression. After 90-minute nature walk, individuals reported fewer repetitivethoughts focused on negative features of the self and a decrease in neural activity in a part of the brain linked with sadness andself-reflection.Public Lands Engagement: Health & Wellness in Nature PAGE 8 Community Messaging Social relationships are important for health When individuals exercise outdoors, they and well -being.

Providing health screenings in par ks makes it easy for residents to access several health resources in one place. Parks and public spaces provide a way to naturally instill a culture of health into the commu nity because they are free, always open, and all are welcome. Public spaces can be one of the only places where people are not limited by their income. Health screenings improve an individual's personal health awareness, understanding of risk factors, and ability to detect symptoms and prevent health risks. Screenings are especially beneficial in identifying health risks and getting early treatment. Employee health screenings are good opportunities for companies to engage employees and t heir families in wellness programs. This allows employers to map healthful behaviors to their mission encouraging healthy mind, body, and spirit. Improving employee health can subsequently increase productivity and decrease product loss due to health- related absenteeism. Assisting employees in improving their lives while simultaneously controlling costs is the ultimate win-win Public Lands Engagement: Health & Wellness in Nature PAGE 12 Types of Health Screings Blood Pressure - Blood pressure is one of the most important screenings because high blood pressure usually has no symptoms, so it's important for people to know their numbers. High blood pressure greatly increases your risk of heart disease and stroke. High blood pressure can be controlled through lifestyle changes and/or medication. Body Mass Index (BMI) - Body M a ss Index is a simple calculation using a person's height and weight. BMI can help determine whether patients are underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese. BMI can be used as a screening tool but is not diagnostic of body size or health of an individual. Diabetes (Blood Glucose) - Diabetes screening tests are a good preventative method for catching the development of diabetes at an early stage. Results from a diabetes screening test can be used to seek further medical advice from a doctor or medical professional. The screening test is not intended as a diagnosis, however, are becoming more commonly used as the prevalence of diabetes continues to grow. Real-World Example Wilsonville Wellness Fair Wilsonville, Oregon Wilsonville Parks and Recreation works to develop an annual interactive health and wellness fair to showcase local resources to members of their community. About 40 local health and wellness vendors set up across the park to provide community members with activities and information on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle. 1 2 3 Types of Health Screenings Public Lands Engagement: Health & Wellness in Nature PAGE 13 By partnerin g with local health and wellness businesses, Wilsonville Parks and Recreation are able to feature various health and wellness providers. The fair also features fun, free activities for all ages, including a bicycle helmet decorating station, kids bike rodeo, trolley rides, various musical performances, yoga in the park, Tai Chi, and fitness demonstrations. Fire and Rescue also provide a free, hands-only CPR training. They also partner with the local transit provider, South Metro Area Regional Transit (SMART), to host a bike rodeo so children of all ages can participate in fun activities at the fair. The fair is interactive and fun for all ages! Wilsonville Parks and Recreation keep vendor fees low (only $25 per vendor), and all proceeds go towards a local organization. This year, they raised $1,180 to go to Wilsonville Community Seniors, Inc., a local non-profit that provides low cost day trips and activities to seniors. Public Lands Engagement: Health & Wellness in Nature PAGE 14 Tips for Success 1.) The key to success is a committed group of volunteers that are passionate about their community's health and wellness to head the event committee. 2.) Partner with local hospitals, physician practices, and departments of health to secure cli nical staff and resources. 3.) Invite local community agencies and organizations, including public health programs such as Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) offices for various services and education. 4.) Include activities and demonstrations such as yoga, aerobic step demonstrations, or other health activities for a hands -on learning experience. 5.) Collaborate with volunteer organizations, which may be able to provide free educational or instructional resources . 6.) The venue for the event is typically donated by a sponsor, who also provides much of the manpower for set -up of the event. 7.) Before the event, introduce yourself to the health community by attending conferences, tabling at events, etc. Featured Resources Carefirst: Guide to Worksite Screening (cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI) Health Fair Planning Guide Organizing Health Fairs for Physical WellnessPublic Lands Engagement: Health & Wellness in Nature PAGE 15 Activity #3 Nature and Forest Therapy (Forest Bathing) Overview Nature and Forest Therapy (also known as Forest Bathing) typically involves meditative walks through the woods with the objective of reconnecting with nature, decreasing stress, elevating natural moods, and strengthening the immune system. Nature Therapy is rooted in practices that promote the experience of nature through all five senses. Forest bathers spend time touching and smelling leaves, bark, and flowers. Some even bring essential oils along to enhance smells. Meditation is often part of the experience as well. The practice received recognition in Japan in the early 1980s when it was endorsed by the Forest Agency of Japan and has since been gaining ground in the United States and other locations around the world. Public Lands Engagement: Health & Wellness in Nature PAGE 16 activism is draining and weighs on their mental wellness. Through this forest bathing event, they were able to see how spending time in nature grounded them and allowed them to refocus on their efforts. In order to show participants that you can connect with nature in any green space, the forest bathing event was held in a small park in a low-income area in the middle of the city. Many participants were surprised by how rejuvenated they felt, and especially appreciated part of the forest therapy session when they were encouraged to find a spot in the park by themselves and reflect on something important to them. To wrap up, participants planted native plants in the park, which gave them something tangible to remember the event. Real-World Examples Earth Day Reflections: Forest Bathing and Civic Engagement Los Angeles, California To celebrate Earth Day, Mi Familia Vota, a national civic engagement organization that unites Latino, immigrant, and allied communities to promote social and economic justice, partnered with Corazon Latino. The goal of their Earth Day celebration was to illustrate how connecting with nature is rejuvenating and beneficial to one's health\u2014something that is particularly helpful to those involved with activism. Individuals often find that being a part of movements and being involved with Full Moon Forest Bathing at the US National Arboretum Washington, DC Full Moon Forest Bathing is a monthly event that gathers nature lovers from all walks of life in Washington, DC to enjoy a safe, relaxing time at the US National Arboretum. Clare Kelley, a certified nature and forest therapy guide, leads participants through invitations: sensory and Public Lands Engagement: Health & Wellness in Nature PAGE 17 interactive experiences to reap the healing gifts of nature. Participants share what they're noticing, while creating a sense of empathy and camaraderie. Few people in an urban setting, like Washington, DC, have the chance to truly explore nature in a safe environment in the dark. The experiences that people have on the walk are truly special, connecting people back to a sense of their human nature. In addition to the traditional forest bathing experience, Friends of the National Arboretum (FONA) offers a Full Moon Hike for anyone that wants to experience the full moon Forest Bathing experience in a more active way. During the hike, participants take a moonlit hike among the forest, meadows, and gardens of the National Arboretum. Clare notes that Forest Bathing is special because \"sharing this very human experience connects people back to the ties that bind us. It reconnects people from populations who have had an uneasy relationship with the natural world. We're often told how healing these walks are for people's sense of belonging, safety, and community.\" Featured Resources Free Forest Therapy Starter Kit (Association of Nature and Forest Therapy Guides and Programs) The Association of Nature & Forest Therapy Member Guide Map & DirectoryTips for Success 1.) Bathing suits are not required! While the concept of Forest Bathing has been floating around for years, many folks are not familiar with it. It can be a rejuvenating experience\u2014 just make sure participants are well informed. 2.) Incorporate an activity that gives back to the environment, like planting, to illustrate the symbiotic relationship that we have with nature. 3.) Utilize local Forest Bathing chapters and the resources that they provide. 4.) Become certified as a Forest Bathing guide and serve as a resource to your community 5.) Choose a green space that is relevant and accessible to the participants of your event. 6.) The ideal location includes some open meadow space as well as forested areas, ideally contained one way or another. 7.) Prepare your team in advance. Have a rain date. Work closely with your guide to anticipate questions that new participants may have before the walk. Remind yourself that patience, kindness and empathy are the best ways for helping the new participants feel safe. 8.) Do not let participants come after the walk begins. Be strict about this. Communicate this clearly to participants in advance. Keeping everyone on time will ensure a fun, safe event.

Despite an ice storm, about 500 people showed up to bike, run, and hike the road. The success of the first event prompted Crater Lake to offer vehicle-free days every year since 2013. On two consecutive Saturdays in September, the park hosts \"Ride the Rim,\" closing the 23 mile stretch of East Rim Drive to automobile traffic. The beautiful yet challenging route over steep grades and large elevation changes is popular among cyclists across the country. Since the first year, the event has expanded to provide services (hydration, bike maintenance, first aid) along the route, and a shuttle to bring cyclists back to their parked cars. Ride the Rim attracts visitors from across the country who enjoy spectacular views of America's deepest lake and surrounding forests without car traffic and noise. This annual National Park Service event is made possible through partnerships with Discover Klamath Visitor and Convention Bureau, a local tourism organization, and Friends of Crater Lake, a non-profit service organization. These organizations provide the funds, organizational skills, staffing, volunteers, and materials (snacks, hydration, bike maintenance, and basic first aid supplies) to run the event each year.

Public Lands Engagement: Health & Wellness in Nature PAGE 25 Activity #6 Gateway Activities Overview Getting Americans active often needs a spark, an outside force that will provide incentive to move off the couch and away from the television. That spark can come from a 'gateway' outdoor activity like fishing, running, camping, bicycling or hiking. Activities like these are popular, accessible and often lead to participation in other outdoor activities. There's also another, terrific benefit of gateway activities. Participants in those popular and accessible activities are much more likely to participate in another outdoor activity than they are likely to participate in one activity alone. Eighty-eight percent of hikers participate in more than one outdoor activit y . Their participation in these activities often leads to higher activity levels and a greater connection with the outdoors. Public lands offer the perfect spaces to host these gateway activities, since most boast amenities such as trails, pavilions, and beaches that draw people in. Hosting gateway activities during community engagement events on these public lands can even further encourage participants to maintain healthy levels of physical fitness.

The event ends with morning yoga and a hot breakfast. The Campout for Public Lands gave the community a place to unite in nature. Through having fun and falling in love with new activities, participants of the campout associate the surrounding forests with positivity and will seek out time in nature. Bike with a Ranger, Mississippi River, National Recreation Area St. Paul, Minnesota The Mississippi River Visitor Center created the Bike with a Ranger program ten years ago as a way to connect people with their local national park site, which includes trails covering 72 miles along the Mississippi river. Participants quickly saw the benefits that this program created not only by educating local communities about the history of the area, but also by creating a fun and easy way to exercise! Public Lands Engagement: Health & Wellness in Nature PAGE 28 The park offers regularly scheduled bike rides at different locations along the trails, each one highlighting the historical, cultural, and environmental history of that area. During the \"Historical Hastings Riverfront\" ride, bike riders learn about the natural, cultural, and historic resources of the Mississippi River. The \"Bike with a Ranger at the Commons\" ride interprets the river with a different lens, as participants hear about how attitudes and behaviors about water can affect the river's character. Each trip is led by a park ranger and includes three or four stops, where the group stops and listens as the ranger explains the importance of the area. Tips for Success 1.) If you are a non- profit organization, look for partners to help with funding. Partners don't need to be big name national companies; any mom and pop business could be great. 2.) Partner with local organizations that share the same dream, mission, and who care about the same things . 3.) Brainstorm activities by first thinking about what the community wants, and then consider how you can get them outside and engaged from there. 4.) Think about what you can do to make the world a better place during your event . 5.) Success depends on getting the word out \u2014 think Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook! 6.) Clearly communicate expectations and what people are going to be doing. For example: the Bike with a Ranger program does not have funds to provide bikes or helmets so they make sure to communi cate very clearly that you need to bring your own helmet.Public Lands Engagement: Health & Wellness in Nature PAGE 29 Activity #7 Green Exercise Overview Outdoor exercise, also known as \"green exercise,\" combines two health-enh ancing activities: moving your body and getting outdoors. Green exercise can be a structured exercise program that takes advantage of natural terrain to get you in shape, or it can be as simple as a brisk walk through a park or forest. Outdoor fitness comes in many forms: light gardening or other yard work, for example, is considered moderate physical activity, and a 154-poun d man can burn approximately 330 calories an hour doing it, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). When it's a beautiful day, take advantage of the opportunity to exercise outside and experience the additional benefits of exercising in the great outdoors.

They decided yoga was the perfect activity because it promotes both physical and mental wellness, has low impact on the environment, and is something that anyone can do. Anywhere from 30 to 100 participants come out to these events. They have even created two moonlight yoga events, which are offered monthly and allow participants to come out and practice yoga under the stars and moon. Full Moon Yoga occurs during the full moon and Milky Way Yoga occurs on the new moon. The program coordinators cite Chrissy Earhart, the yoga instructor that leads the activity each week, as the reason for the program's great success. Chrissy is able to connect participants with the natural elements of the beach and ensures that the yoga ses sion is inclusive of all types of people, no matter their age or ability level.

Ensure the program is accessible to anyone at any skill level. 3.) You need to have buy-in from the organization/ place that is hosting the event. Invite stakeholders to observe and participate in the event so they will understand its impact. 2018 NPLD Event: Championing Public Lands\u2014Restoring Habitats and Ourselves Denver, Colorado In honor of National Public Lands Day, a group of youth volunteers from the neighborhoods surrounding a local wildlife refuge participated in stewardship activities focused on restoring area grasslands that were once the site of a weapon depository. With support from Promotores Verdes \u2014 a Latinx family-based youth program affiliated with the Woodsy Owl Conservation Corps \u2014 and United Cultures for Arts + Nature (U-CAN), volunteers learned about the history of the area, the wildlife that live there, and how to protect this land that has become a treasured resource for their community. Youth volunteers were able to experience the health benefits of nature first-hand by participating in a nature walk through the area with naturalists and health professionals, and took part in some physical exercise by participating in a Zumba dance class and pedaling on bicycles to power the music and sound system for the outdoor event. Volunteers also had the opportunity to learn about local pollinators by collecting pollinator seeds, which greatly aided area restoration efforts, and by partaking in a pollinator-inspired lunch.Public Lands Engagement: Health & Wellness in Nature PAGE 33 Activity #8 SunWise Overview With one in five Americans developing skin explore, assess, and understand their natural cancer in their lifetime, education about sun environment and the factors that affect their safety is a vital step toward reducing risk and health.

The Walk to Wellness is an outdoor event that includes fitness center class demonstrations such as Zumba and kickboxing; music; a walk around the neighborhood; and sports competitions such as hula hoop and football toss. The National Environmental Education Foundation (NEEF) was invited to promote the SunWise program demonstrating the harmful effects of UV radiation and the effectiveness of different ways to block UV radiation by engaging employees in various activities. One featured activit y , UV Frisbee Science, demonstrated the effects of UV radiation and the effects of different materials on blocking out UV radiation. The activity used three UV Frisbees each covered with either baby oil, cotton cloth (t-shirt), or broad-spectrum sunscreen (with SPF 30 and above). Participants recorded observations after each frisbee was exposed to direct sunlight. After completing the activity, participants described ways they can protect themselves against harmful UV radiation and indicated behaviors they intend to change to be SunWise. Tips for Success 1.) If possible, make available giveaways and free samples of broad-spectrum sunscreens. 2.) Contact NEEF for information on procuring UV frisbees and beads. 3.) Partner with schools, local park and recreation agencies, community centers, and faith-based organizations. 4.) On overcast days carry on with activities. Remember UV rays are present even when there is limited or no sunlight. Public Lands Engagement: Health & Wellness in Nature PAGE 35 Family Science Nig ht Centreville, Virginia Centreville Elementary School hosted Family Science Night, a program that introduces STEM learning by bringing fun hands -on activities to students, parents and caregivers. Through the family -learning exercises, children and their families participate in a variety of science- based activities and are encouraged to develop an interest in STEM sub jects. NEEF was invited to host SunWise demonstrations to educate attendees on the importance of sun safety. Highlighted during the event was the Detecting UV Light Using Tonic Water activity that demonstrates the presence of UV light in sunlight. When a photon of UV energy is absorbed, it is re -emitted by quinine in tonic water as a photon of visible light. This process is called fluorescence. The amount of fluorescence that occurs is influenced by the amount of UV. This reinforces the concept that UV light is always present in sunlight, although invisible to the naked eye. Staff used tonic water and tap water to demonstrate the surfaces of t he waters in two beakers. After completing the tonic water experiment, participants discussed the chemical reactions that were involved in the changes of the tonic and tap water. They observed that when light shines on an object, it is reflected, absorbed, or transmitted through the object depending on the objects' materials and the frequency (color) of the light.

Through this partnership, they offer art therapy workshops through the Art in the Park and Healthy Parks Healthy People programs. WEFA provides the use of an art studio at the park and has hosted art therapy sessions for various targeted audiences in the park since 2012, including an informational session for staff and volunteers to help them understand the importance of art therapy and the Healthy Parks Healthy People initiative. WEFA's Art Therapy Program in Wilton, Connecticut, provides a space for people to explore art and nature in a non-traditional therapy setting in a public space. The art therapy sessions reach many different audiences, including cancer patients, at-risk youth, individuals in substance abuse recovery, and medically fragile children. Data from self-reported surveys completed by participants in the program showed that on average, 96% of participants experienced reduced stress levels following the art therapy workshop, and participants reported about a 25% decrease in stress levels. About 15 workshops have been held thus far, and participants and their families often continue to use the park as a space for healing and wellness. 3 4 5 6 Public Lands Engagement: Health & Wellness in Nature PAG E 38 Butte County Art Therapy Support Group - Northern California Art Therapy Association Northern California The Northern California Art Therapy Association (NorCATA) provides free art therapy sessions for all to enjoy on the second Saturday of every month. Art therapy is explored through a variety of media, including photography , painting, sculpture, textiles, mixed media, as well as both found and natural materials. This art therapy group is a series of sessions developed to help individuals effected by the Butte County Camp Fire of November 8, 2018 to gradually work through their trauma and provide a spac e for healing that is safe, consistent, and connected to the community. At the start of each session, participants complete a PTSD screening for their personal reference and to track any progress they have been making. After the art exercise, the group therapeutically delves into the art, the emotions it evokes, where it resides in the body and the shifting of the mind that occurs during its making. The group communicates throughout the session to help recreate a sense of community, which can often be scattered after a trauma. The sessions always incorporate nature into the healing process, and gradually allow participants to heal. The scheduling of sessions is very mindful of the participants' trauma. These materials will be turned to ash and used to paint using the Japanese Sumi -e and Zen Shigajiku style of painting. Paintings are made with ink from fire cinders and are intended to focus on harmony with nature, allowing participants to both simultaneously explore and express themselves. The focus on such natural elements allows participants to work to establish a connection with nature and establish nature as a grounding place. In December, the group plans to produce knitting/crocheting textiles and go out into the community and wrap trees, mailboxes, houses that have survived the fire, etc. with knit materials. Natu re will come back. It pushes back. It is incredibly resilient. Humans have that resiliency too; we come from nature.\" -Dr. Cynthia Wilson, board- cer tified art therapist and facilitator of art therapyPublic Lands Engagement: Health & Wellness in Nature PAGE 39 The textile inspires a sense of being protected and safe, and helps participants engage with their community. The group is led by a certified art therapist alongside other health providers, which fosters a space for individuals to positively express themselves and self- reflect. Participants are also given tools to use on their own that they can do at home, allowing for a continuous healing process. Dr. Cynthia Wilson, registered and board- certified art therapist and facilitator of the art therapy support gr oups notes that the groups help participants heal by recognizing that nature fights back after trauma, as do humans. She notes \"nature will come back. It pushes back. It is incredibly resilient. Humans have that resiliency too; we come from nature.\" Tips for Success 1.) Focus on what emerges in the moment, allowing it to be a natural process and see where the process takes you. 2.) Allow participants to find a quiet place in nature with their sketchpad and take time to become familiar with the things surrounding them that intrigue them or attract them. Have participants note any elements that correspond to aspects of themselves, and then write a poem to the element. 3.) Have participants gather things that have fallen off or are no longer living (e.g. leaves, seashells, feathers, etc.) and use them to create a nest to protect the parts of them they feel are vulnerable. 4.) Engage the whole family by providing art therapy for adults and a children's station with coloring, toys, games, and story time. 5.) Collaborate with a local art therapist to lead the art therapy session. 6.) Be flexible/adaptive: focus more on what emerges from the moment rather than following a rigid structure throughout the moment.

Community clean-up events get people outside and moving while benefitting the environment. Clean-up events can take on various forms and can even be a form of aerobic exercise, benefitting both your body and the Earth. Community service also improves mental health. Research has found that giving back to the community and volunteering has many positive effects on mental health. Volunteering is predictive of better mental and physical health, life satisfaction, and social well-being. Those who volunteer regularly tend to have better well-being than those that do not. Because volunteering often also takes the form of physical activity or labor, it is associated with a reduction in blood pressure and risk for cardiovascular disease. Individuals who volunteer on environmental issues are 2.6 times as likely to meet physical activity recommendations as those who do not volunteer .

Conewango Creek and the Allegheny River, giving individuals the opportunity to give back to their community while conducting an aerobic exercise activity. At the beginning of each day, participants were briefed on the safety procedures and the clean- up process and given equipment and clean- up gear. Volunteers were assigned to kayaks or canoes and spent most of the day paddling in the water collecting trash and loading it into their boats. The collected waste was then sorted into landfill garbage and recyclable scrap. A total of 2,688 volunteer hours were accumulated over the event, and 11,782 lbs. of metal, 92 tires, and 40 cubic yards of trash were removed from the water. Tips for Success 1.) Engage civic leaders to increase coverage of the event and attract more volunteers. 2.) Collaborate with public works department or public maintenance to ensure gathered waste is disposed of properly.
