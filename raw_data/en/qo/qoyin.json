I am grateful for you, Chulia, Roberto, and the Otomi Nation as you welcomed me to Aurelio Diaz Tekpankalli. I enjoyed learning the history, culture, traditions and spiritual ways of the Otomi. Jose was our guardian, spiritual guide, teacher. healer, medicine man, tour guide, and friend. He is wise beyond his years. I trusted him with my health and my life. He was with us the whole week that we stayed in Tekpankalli for our Tamoanchan Retreat. The lodge that we stayed in was a cradle surrounded by mountains. I did not miss electricity...it was not needed! Jose & Chulia prepared our meals...delicious healthy vegetarian traditional meals! The river protecting Teknankalli and nurturing all living beings was a luxurious bathtub & spa....thank-you river for our massages! The Temazcal (sweat lodge) experience served as detoxication and purification before our medicine ceremony, then again following our medicine ceremony. The medicine ceremony was an intense, mystifying experience. My intention was to heal my heart and my brain. I did that in the longest night of my life, and the longest day of my life. And, I am did healing since my retreat. Jose, I will see you next year for another retreat! As well, our bird watching, yoga, mountain meditation hike, and connect with nature was so needed! I felt safe, cared for, and loved. Thank-you Jose. My dear friend. Thank you so much for your comments. I was our pleasure to meet you. It is our commitment to share with our guests in these times our culture and spiritual legacy for a greater purpose. We will be waiting for you. Warm regards. Pepe. Nayarit Wild. Tamoanchan sounds like \"time for a change\"! In hindsight, that it was ....and more. We spent an unparalleled 6 days with Jose (Pepe), learning about the Otomi peoples and ourselves on their sacred lands in the mountains. We signed up for a healthy retreat which included temezcal and medicine ceremony. Totally new experiences which honestly can be challenging. Knowing that, Pepe asked that we be onsite for a few days to prepare for the ceremonies. It allowed us to acclimatize, eat healthy, start the detox process, enjoy the sights and sounds of the area but more importantly it allowed Pepe to get to know us and our purpose for being there. It was like being immersed in a culture, educated on their way of life, learning about ceremonies and rituals, and feeling the spirit of the ancestors surrounding us in those mountains. Powerful! Pepe's ability to guide you through the ceremonies is awe inspiring. He radiates such a love for life, peoples, creatures, and Mother Earth that you are very honoured that he includes you as part of his family. He is truly a gracious and humble host/educator/medicine man/tour guide/ bird watching companion/and best coffee maker. Our stay was more than comfortable and the food was delicious. We were well looked after! We saw some amazing birds, did a meditative hike in the mountains, and \"swam\" in the river. It was the perfect location to unplug and to appreciate life and all that it encompasses. My dear friend. Thanks so much for your comments. It was our pleasure to meet you. It is our commitment in these times to share our culture for a greater purpose. Warm regards. Pepe. Nayarit Wild. We joined Pepe for a temazcal (sweat) ceremony. It was profound and Pepe is amazing! I could feel how his huge heart is open to help all of creation heal. The Tamoanchan ceremonial center is designed for profound spiritual and transformational experiences. We plan to return to participate in medicine ceremonies, which is a huge testament to the comfort and trust level I feel with Pepe. Thank you, Pepe.... for gifting us a part of you and your spiritual traditions. You are an amazing soul! Dear Tiffany. Thank you so much for your comments. It really feeds my heart. Gracias. It was a pleasure to meet you. I hope to meet you again in Ceremony soon. Warmly. Pepe. I recently spent time with Pepe on the sacred indigenous land and my experience with him was beyond anything I could have wished for. The land itself is stunning, butterflies and macaws in my path, while also rich with the history of indigenous ceremonies and culture. A place and a time like this for oneself is a gift, and no ordinary occurrence. Be prepared to dive deep into meditation, guided by Pepe, a true wise man. His wisdom, kindness, clarity and authenticity is a rare combination in a human being. There are few people hosting ceremonies and meditations of indigenous nature that have the training from direct lineage- Pepe does. He understands the sacred knowledge and carries it truly. Therefore in meditation with him, there is no choice but to have a beautiful and life altering experience that contributes greatly to your own evolution. I returned back home stronger in my own spirit, and permanently so. I must also say that Pepe organized the trip well- he picked us up from our location which was far from the land, he made us delicious wholesome food, and he took deep care in knowing who we are. I can not say enough positive things about my experience. What a blessing. My dear friend. Thank you so much for your comments. It was my pleasure to meet you. I am looking forward to meet you soon. Warmly. Pepe. My time with Pepe' in the in the jungle on the private tribal land where he hosts, was a profound life changing journey back to my center forward on my path. He is authentic, kind, thoughtful, and greatest of all a true healer learning these ways since he was 9 years old; he doesn't directly come out to say that he is an authentic Shaman, but I believe he is. At home, I have a busy healing practice as a massage therapist, as well as a full time mother. Pepe' changed our lives in many ways. His bilingual ease, from all the years of eco tourism hosting people from all over, was so helpful. He picked us up in his truck from San Pancho. We spent four days and four profoundly transforming nights in a medicinal Wellbeing Retreat, surrounding privately in nature integrated with two beautiful Temazcal Ceremonies. To be there in that place, I received the clearest and most profound healing session I have ever experienced. This brought me clear information, detailed visions, messages and tools. The time with Pepe', exchanging thoughts, sharing beautiful homemade and organic fresh foods which he provided, Chulia the neighbor who came every day with her husband to both clean and heat up the lava rocks for the Temezcal's, the jungle walk, the bird walk, the liberal trips to the river to swim and be with the nature, and walks on the grounds, many long naps to rejuvenate, were all exactly what was needed to regain my center. He took care of us as if we were family. This reset and experience, showed me what was most important in my life to focus on, and directed me clearly to understand my upcoming future focus. Everything that was making me not feel well and whole, I now have deep gratitude and love for; the lessons that are totally behind me; this occurred with a direct ease I would not have come to without going through this time and healing with Pepe'. For this, I am forever grateful to Pepe'. It has helped me to bond even more deeply with my son, and our love for each other expanded beyond my previous understanding. We came away being excited and refreshed with the knowledge and natural feeling of freedom to follow through with new habits to sustain our health and support us in this life. And to end our time with him, on the way back to San Pancho, we stopped at the freshest local seafood eatery for a real treat! Pepe' is impactful, humble, and insightful, direct, kind, caring, sensitive, and is a profound teacher. And as a husband, father and healer all his life from generations of his people's tribal ways, he is extremely effective; you will be in very good hands with him. I feel that he can change lives and the state of the planet by the way he helps and affects everyone he works with in a positive unique way. I believe those affected by him can rise to an optimal loving healthy state of consciousness and be much stronger guardians of our planet. I am planning to do this once a year, to reset and receive healing on this level to continue developing my fullest potential and wellness of my whole being, so I can continue going forth as a richer example for those I affect in my surroundings. I highly recommend everyone to do the same as you will benefit beyond your understanding; you will fully heal. You can't afford not to come to this place with Pepe' and experience what we have. We are ever grateful, thank you Pepe'! We look forward to our future work together! Hola! Thank you so much for your comments. It was a pleasure to meet you and share our culture and spiritual legacy. It is our commitment in our tours, retreats and ceremonies to take care of our guests. Making sure that you have a great experience. See you soon. Warmly. Pepe. I had last minute indigeneous healing and learning experience with Pepe this winter. As someone who has traveled all over the world, participating in authentic culture practices all over-this was a blessing. Pepe is one of the most kindest humans I have ever met who is completely dedicated to service. In this experience Pepe made sure I was well take care of as a solo traveller: he was able to pick me up, well planned in my experience and ensured I was on time for pick up/ department, fed vegan/ veg simple clean food and had an authentic ceremony including a temezcal. The cermony site is well maintained, simple and in the middle of the jungle. The most beautiful butterflies and raw nature all around including scorpions, cochroaches, a wide range of spiders and more. Make sure you bring your misquito repellent. The site has simple and private showers, a kitchen and more. It's quite magical and has some beautiful history with people from all over the world coming yearly to join in local traditional ceremony. I will definitely be going back and trying some of the other nature experiences he offers. Dear Loretta. Thank you very much for your comments. It is our commitment to share our culture and spiritual legacy in this times. I hope to have the opportunity to share a little bit more of our culture. Warmly. Pepe. Nayarit Wild. "}
