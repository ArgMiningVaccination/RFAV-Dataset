The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that people at average risk of colon cancer begin regular screening at age 50. For those with risk factors associated with colon cancer, screening may need to begin earlier. Colonoscopy remains the screening gold standard to both detect cancer and prevent it by allowing doctors to identify and remove abnormal intestinal polyps before they become cancerous. \"Colonoscopy reduces the incidence of colorectal cancer by up to 90 percent,\" Dr. Tripathi says. FIT, which checks for blood in stool, is a less invasive stool test alternative to colonoscopy. If a FIT is positive, a follow-up colonoscopy is needed to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of polyps or cancer. While insurance covers colorectal cancer screening including colonoscopies, some patients may opt for short-term anesthesia for colonoscopy, which may result in additional charges. Cologuard is a newer DNA stool test that still is being evaluated as another alternative stool test. Preparation is key. It is very important to follow instructions carefully; colonoscopy is much less effective if the preparation is not complete and may need to be rescheduled if the prep is poor. You will receive detailed instructions for the preparation, along with a checklist to ensure that everything is ready for the procedure. The procedure is not as bad as you imagine. A colonoscopy typically takes less than 20 minutes. While you are under light sedation, the doctor inserts a flexible tube with a light and small video camera into the colon. If the doctor sees a polyp or other suspicious-looking area, he or she can remove it for further study. \"Many patients I talk to after the procedure often say, 'That's it?' They're in disbelief that it's over so fast,\" Dr. Tripathi says. Following the test, someone should be available to drive you home and stay with you for a few hours afterward until you recover fully from the sedation.Screening recommendations may vary. While the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends regular screening starting at age 50, those at higher risk may need to begin earlier. Higher-risk patients include those with a first-degree relative with colon cancer or precancerous colon polyps, a history of inflammatory bowel disease or a genetic condition that is associated with colon cancer. African Americans also are at higher risk and should be screened starting at age 45. It is important to talk about potential risk factors with your physician. For average-risk patients with normal prior tests, a screening colonoscopy is recommended every 10 years. More frequent screening is recommended for patients who have had multiple polyps or other suspicious findings. FIT testing should be repeated annually. LAWCOLON CANCER Priyam Tripathi, MD, MPH Most colorectal cancers occur in people age 50 and older. While colonoscopies are the gold standard for preventing and detecting this disease, one-third of Americans put off getting the test. To improve screening rates, UCLA Health is increasing efforts to educate patients about their options, including colonoscopy and take-home, mail-in fecal immunochemical tests (FIT). Whether you select colonoscopy or a FIT, the most important choice is to be screened. Priyam Tripathi, MD, MPH, a UCLA gastroenterologist in Beverly Hills, shares some important facts.Screening remains best defense against colon cancer To see what UCLA Health services, including gastroenterology, are offered in your neighborhood, go to: uclahealth.org/gastroFor information about upcoming colon cancer screening events, go to: uclahealth.org/gastro/ community-educationRx to parents: Encourage children to play more UCLAHEALTH.ORG 1-800-UCLA-MD1 (1-800-825-2631)PARENTINGRx to parents: Encourage children to play more Vital Signs Winter 2019 Vol. 81 5Pediatricians can provide a simple prescription to parents to increase their child's social-emotional, cognitive, language and self-regulation skills: interactive play. In a report issued last summer, the American Academy of Pediatrics pointed to mounting evidence of the importance of developmentally appropriate play in early childhood development . It notes that the benefits o f interactive play include boosts in creativity and critical thinking, as w ell as increased resilience resulting from the nurturing relationships that play fosters. \"With so much emphasis on how important the early years are to child development, many parents assume that they need to start emphasizing academics during that time. But in reality, it's free or guided play that is potentially the most beneficial,\" says UCLA pediatrician Carlos F. Lerner, MD. \"For parents to enter their child's world and directly interact with that child is more valuable than going through flash cards or investing in educational software or TV programs.\" Dr. Lerner says the push by pediatricians to promote the benefits of play is akin to longer- standing efforts to encourage parents to spend more time reading aloud to their children as a key component of their language development. The \"prescription\" recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics endorses play that is \"intrinsically motivated, entails active engagement and results in joyful discovery.\" Object play, physical play, outdoor play and social or pretend play, alone or with others, all are described as beneficial, whereas excessive screen time is discouraged. \"Play teaches children how to think and make decisions that will allow them to participate effectively in society, as well as helping them form social relationships with their peers and nurturing relationships with their parents,\" says Gregory C. Dann, MD, a UCLA pediatrician in Manhattan Beach. Ideally, Dr. Dann explains, children's exploration should be fueled by both self-guided play and adult-guided activities in which they are assisted toward a desired goal.Filling the play prescription has taken on greater urgency in light of several societal trends, Dr. Lerner says. These include the growing concern about childhood obesity as many children lead more sedentary lifestyles. Also worrying, he says, is the explosion in the role of screens \u2014 computers, smart pads, phones, televisions \u2014 in the lives of young children, particularly as substitutes for face-to-face interactions and time that could be spent in free or structured play activities. As more parents work full time and many neighborhoods offer fewer safe places to play, the amount of playtime is further reduced. Finally, there is the growing emphasis on early literacy and math skills, with the push for academic achievement starting as early as preschool, often at the expense of playful learning. \"While increasing focus is given to structured academic learning to promote future success,\" Dr. Dann concludes, \"it's the socio-emotional development that children receive from play that will allow them to become happy, well-balanced adults.\" \" For parents to enter their child's world and directly interact with that child is more valuable than going through flash cards or investing in educational software or TV programs.\" The UCLA High Risk Breast Clinic in Santa Monica provides eligible women, referred by a primary care physician or other specialist, access to a multidisciplinary team that includes a medical oncologist, genetic counselor, clinical nutritionist and breast surgeon. The team designs a personalized screening and risk-reduction strategy, with the goal of preventing breast cancer or detecting cancer as early as possible so that it can be aggressively treated. \"Breast cancer is a highly curable cancer,\" says Aashini Master, DO, the center's lead physician. \"But that's only true if we catch it before it has spread and reached a metastatic stage.\" Most women who are seen at the center either have the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene Specialized program available for women at high risk for breast cancer WOMEN'S HEALTH Just over 12 percent of American women \u2014 one -in-eight \u2014 will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime. But because of family history or an inherited genetic mutation, some women are at a much higher risk than others for getting breast cancer. UCLAHEALTH.ORG 1-800-UCLA-MD1 (1-800-825-2631) Vital Signs Winter 2019 Vol. 81 7 mutation, which brings one's lifetime risk for developing breast cancer up to 70-to-80 percent; are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent with a family history of breast cancer; or have a first- or second-degree relative \u2014 meaning a mother, sister, aunt or grandmother \u2014 who was diagnosed with breast cancer before they turned 50. \"The younger a family member was at the time of diagnosis,\" Dr. Master says, \"the more it's going to impact a patient's risk.\" Women with a lifetime risk greater than 20 percent are considered to be at high risk and are eligible to enroll in the program. While most of the program's patients are in their 30s or 40s, Dr. Master has some patients in their 20s. After age 30, high-risk women often start receiving regular mammograms. This is significant, because an average-risk woman doesn't typically get her first mammogram until sometime between 40 and 50 years old \u2014 which may be too late if she has any significant family history, Dr. Master says. In addition to more rigorous screening, Dr. Master and her team work with high-risk women to put them on an anticancer nutrition program, and they discuss other lifestyle changes, such as limiting alcohol intake to three glasses per week and exercising three hours a week. They also review complementary therapies and other preventive steps, such as going on an anticancer medication like tamoxifen if they have a high five-year risk or having a surgery to remove the breasts before cancer forms, known as a prophylactic mastectomy. \"Many of the patients we see already are anxious about their risk of developing breast cancer and are worried they're not receiving the correct screenings based on their risk,\" Dr. Master says. \"Having a program like this captures this population in which we can detect the cancer at a much earlier stage than what would be possible with a typical screening protocol, and it really can make a difference.\"Continued from cover Sports cardiology program tends to athletes' heartsSPORTS MEDICINE codirector of UCLA Sports Cardiology and director of interventional cardiology. \"In the UCLA Sports Cardiology Program, we can address their physical limitations and deliver multidisciplinary care and advice. We work with patients to determine the next steps to ensure their safety and determine how they can exercise and exert themselves. A 'cardiology sports prescription' is key for these patients.\" Experts provide care to athletes and active adults with new or known pre-existing cardiac abnormalities or those who have risk factors for heart disease or cardiac abnormalities, such as a family history of sudden death or heart attack, high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiomyopathy, and congenital or arrhythmic heart disease. The diagnosis of acquired or inherited cardiovascular conditions in athletes is not uncommon, Dr. Nsair says. \"There are inherited cardiac abnormalities that may go undetected for years,\" he says. \"Being able to identify those athletes or active people who have such conditions and guide them is very important.\" The program is staffed with a multidisciplinary group of cardiologists \u2014 including specialists in women's cardiology health and other cardiac specialties such as arrhythmias and congenital heart disease \u2014 who are specially trained to screen for and manage cardiovascular conditions in athletes. \"Athletes have very special needs when it comes to cardiac care,\" Dr. Nsair says. \"There are nuances in the diagnostics and care of an athlete. For example, healthy athletes may have normal electrocardiogram or echocardiogram variations that, while normal for an athlete, may be misconstrued as abnormal. Expertise is required to decipher the normal from the pathologic and avoid unnecessary treatments or interventions.\"Among the services provided are comprehensive assessment and examination; monitoring and clearance for professional athletes to return to sports activity; second opinions for patients with pre-existing heart disease wishing to participate in competitive sports; advanced imaging tests; and consultation with a cardiovascular genetic cardiologist and counselor. While many people with cardiovascular conditions wish to remain physically active, the UCLA Sports Cardiology Program differs from a typical cardiac rehabilitation program. \"With a typical cardiac patient, we try to encourage exercise and an active lifestyle,\" Dr. Dave says. \"But that is very different from a person who is involved in competitive sports. It's important to guide these patients on what they are able to do and how much they can push themselves.\" Specialized care and assessment often provides enormous psychological relief to athletes and active adults with cardiac conditions, he adds. \"Occasionally, we hear of very unfortunate cases of a young athlete who suffers sudden cardiac death,\" Dr. Nsair says. \"We want to engage the sports cardiology field in how to screen athletes to detect potential abnormalities so they can be addressed. This is a service that has been underrepresented in Southern California and throughout the United States.\" He also notes that the program is engaged in clinical research in the emerging field of cardiovascular wearable and screening technologies for athletic and cardiac patients.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T -cell therapy fights the cancer by redirecting T cells, which play a central role in the immune response, to enhance the body's natural defenses. Two CAR T-cell treatments have been approved by the FDA, and UCLA Health is among the few institutions providing such therapy outside of clinical trials \u2014 a setting in which UCLA has offered the treatment for several years. Josh Sasine, MD, PhD, director of UCLA Health's new CAR T -cell program, talks about the promising results the therapy has produced and the larger significance of the approach.CAR T -cell therapy changes dynamic in fight against some cancersONCOLOGY Vital Signs Winter 2019 Vol. 81 9 How does CAR T-cell therapy work? CAR T-cell therapy combines several approaches to cancer treatment: cell therapy (such as a bone marrow transplant), immune therapy and gene therapy. Healthy immune cells \u2014 specifically, T cells \u2014 are separated from a patient's blood. Then, in the laboratory, manufacturers insert a chimeric antigen receptor, which is a synthetic gene that can recognize certain types of cancer cells. These genetically altered immune cells are grown in the lab to clinically relevant numbers and we reinfuse them into the patient. These T cells now have the ability to recognize and eradicate the cancer cells, much as they would in the case of an infection. So, in a nutshell, it is an approach to strengthen the immune system's ability to fight off the cancer? Exactly. In this case, it's a genetic modification doing the work that would normally be done naturally by the immune system. We have known the immune system is involved in protection from cancer for a long time. For example, if the immune system is suppressed, either after an organ transplant or because of a virus such as HIV, patients are at higher risk for developing cancers. So, we know that the immune system does clear out cancer naturally; this is the revved-up version of that. Who is the therapy for? For now, this is only for patients with blood cancers that arise out of B cells, which are the cells that naturally produce antibodies. Most lymphomas in adults and leukemias in children arise from this population of cells. CAR T-cell therapy is only offered to patients with these cancers who have not benefited from two standard treatments. That's because CAR T cells can overstimulate the immune system and cause inflammation, which can lead to significant side effects. However, the vast majority of patients with these cancers who have not benefited from at least two standard therapies will die within a year without CAR T cells. With them, their survival is above 50 percent. Beyond those numbers, what is significant about this treatment? The significance is twofold. One is that the degree to which some patients benefit is remarkable. Most successful therapies for advanced cancers increase overall survival by a few months but almost never cause long-term remissions. With CAR T cells, we're seeing durations of benefit that are very long lasting \u2014 many years of cancer- free periods. About one-third to half of the patients who receive this therapy are having durable remissions. But the treatment is so new that we don't yet know who has experienced a true cure. It also is significant that this treatment platform is very different from what we have done in oncology in the past, and, in principle, it is broadly applicable. Until ongoing and future clinical trials are complete, we won't know whether or not we can make CAR T cells recognize other forms of cancer. If we can, this could benefit many more patients. Do you expect to see this approach tested in many other cancers? Testing for other cancers is currently ongoing. It is one thing to have success in the lab, but the fact that we are seeing so much success with CAR T cells validates the idea that we can genetically engineer the immune system to fight cancer. This is likely to encourage investigators to examine other strategies to genetically engineer immune cells for cancer therapy. It opens up an exciting new direction. I have not seen any other approach demonstrate this much success so quickly.

But for some individuals, these are not short-term bouts of a troublesome condition, nor are they confined to the nose. Patients with chronic sinusitis experience symptoms that are more systemic, with effects that are more profound. \"In these patients, we tend to see depression, loss of productivity, problems concentrating and sleeping, and the sense that you're constantly living in a brain fog,\" says Jeffrey Suh, MD, a rhinologist in the UCLA Nasal and Sinus Disease Program. \"It's these intangible effects \u2014 not just the runny nose \u2014 that tend to bring patients to us for surgery.\"The UCLA Nasal and Sinus Disease Program offers medical and surgical management of complex nasal and sinus problems, including chronic sinusitis, allergic rhinitis and nasal-breathing problems associated with allergic and structural problems of the nose. For patients with chronic sinusitis, the impact of their condition can be far greater than might be appreciated. Research indicates that chronic sinusitis sufferers report lower scores on measures of bodily pain and social functioning than patients with congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and back pain, for example, Dr. Suh notes. These patients can improve significantly from endoscopic sinus surgery, a minimally invasive approach to opening up and cleaning out the sinuses. The program's endoscopic techniques avoid the facial incisions and numbness that are associated with other forms of sinus surgery, Dr. Suh says. The vast majority of patients can be treated on an outpatient basis and are nearly or completely symptom-free within weeks. \"Many patients feel better than they have for decades \u2014 if not their entire lives \u2014 after sinus surgery,\" Dr. Suh says. Care of the patient doesn't end after the surgery. \"It is just as important that we identify the cause of the sinus problem and make sure it's treated postoperatively,\" Dr. Suh says. Unlike acute sinusitis, which is almost always caused by a viral or bacterial infection, chronic sinusitis usually is multifactorial, with infections, genetic conditions, immune deficiencies and long-standing, untreated allergies all serving as potential culprits, Dr. Suh explains. The sinus program's physicians work closely with allergists and other specialists to ensure that patients receive proper postoperative medical management. In addition to chronic sinusitis, other types of cases treated by the sinus program include rhinitis, a potentially debilitating condition characterized by a stuffy or runny nose; allergic or structural problems such as a deviated or crooked septum that can interfere with nasal breathing; and more complicated cases, including revision surgeries, sinus tumors and cerebrospinal fluid leaks. Many of these conditions can be resolved endoscopically, often in conjunction with other specialists at UCLA, Dr. Suh says. \"Most patients who walk in to an ENT doctor don't need a super-specialist,\" he notes. \"Our goal is to be a resource for the more complicated or unusual problems.\" Dr. Suh notes that sinus surgery has changed substantially over the last decade, particularly with the advent of high- definition audiovisual technology and intraoperative navigation. Also, use of nasal packing that has to be removed after surgery is uncommon. \"There is a misconception that sinus surgery is ineffective, and that patients who go through it are likely to have recurrent disease and require multiple operations,\" Dr. Suh notes. \"Sinus surgery does work, and our goal, by managing these cases from beginning to end, is to make sure it is the patient's only operation.\" \" In these patients [with chronic sinusitis], we tend to see depression, loss of productivity, problems concentrating and sleeping, and the sense that you're constantly living in a brain fog.\" Chronic sinusitis has impacts beyond a runny noseEAR, NOSE, THROAT For more information about the UCLA Nasal and Sinus Disease Program, go to: uclahealth.org/head-neck-surgery/ nasal-sinus-disease-program Vital Signs Winter 2019 Vol. 81 11A specialized epilepsy center can offer potential remedies to most patients who are experiencing uncontrolled seizures, UCLA epilepsy experts say. Through accurate diagnosis and a range of effective treatments, UCLA's specialized epilepsy centers for adults and adolescents can dramatically improve patients' quality of life while substantially reducing their risk for premature death. The UCLA Seizure Disorder Center works in collaboration with referring physicians to formulate an effective plan that can involve nonsurgical approaches, new minimally invasive procedures or, when appropriate, surgery. The new Adolescent Epilepsy Center at UCLA brings together a team of health care providers to focus on all aspects of health for adolescents with epilepsy while helping adolescent patients make a smooth transition from pediatric to adult epilepsy physicians. Of the 3.4 million people in the U.S. who have epilepsy, 1 million continue to experience seizures even on medication. These individuals are at a five-to-10 times greater risk of dying suddenly, as well as being at a higher risk of depression and suicide. \"Every patient who has tried one or two medications and is not seizure-free should be referred to a specialized epilepsy center for an evaluation,\" says Dawn Eliashiv, MD, codirector of the UCLA Seizure Disorder Center. As many as one-third of patients who undergo a comprehensive epilepsy evaluation at UCLA are found to have a condition other than epilepsy that can produce seizures \u2014 a discovery that can lead to other, more effective treatments. For patients with a confirmed epilepsy diagnosis, a better characterization of the condition can point the way toward a different medication with the potential to be more successful. There are approximately 20 approved epilepsy medications, as well as experimental drugs available through clinical trials. For patients unable to benefit from any medication, surgery may be an appropriate option. Because of the significant advances in surgical approaches, more patients are candidates for surgery than in the past, Dr. Eliashiv says. Beyond traditional epilepsy surgery, the UCLA Seizure Disorder Center offers more minimally invasive options. Vagus nerve stimulation, sometimes referred to as a \"pacemaker for the brain,\" sends mild pulses of electrical energy to the brain through a nerve in the neck to prevent seizures. Responsive neurostimulation, in which an implanted device analogous to a heart defibrillator detects the onset of a seizure and sends an electrical pulse to stop it, also can be beneficial. Laser thermal ablation, another relatively new minimally invasive technique, is ideal for patients in whom the area of the brain generating the seizures is small but difficult to reach through traditional surgery. In addition to offering state-of-the-art treatments, the Adolescent Epilepsy Center at UCLA addresses other conditions that affect many teens with epilepsy, including depression, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning disabilities and autism spectrum disorder. Treating conditions such as depression and anxiety in patients with epilepsy requires special expertise to ensure, for example, that medications don't adversely interact with antiseizure drugs, notes pediatric neurologist Jason T. Lerner, MD, director of the adolescent center. The Adolescent Epilepsy Center at UCLA includes pediatric neurologists and epileptologists, nurse practitioners, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a dietitian, an occupational therapist and a social worker, all under the same roof and working as a team. The center treats patients ages 12 to 20 who have epilepsy. In addition, monthly support groups are offered to both adolescent epilepsy patients and their caregivers. The center also focuses on community education. \"More than most chronic diseases, there is a stigma associated with epilepsy,\" Dr. Lerner says. \"Part of improving our patients' quality of life is educating the community to begin to remove that stigma.\" EPILEPSY For more information about the UCLA Seizure Disorders Center, go to: uclahealth.org/mattel/pediatric- neurology/infantile-spasms-program For more information about the Adolescent Epilepsy Center at UCLA, go to: uclahealth.org/mattel/ adolescent-epilepsy Specialized epilepsy centers can offer significant benefits to patients UCLAHEALTH.ORG 1-800-UCLA-MD1 (1-800-825-2631)BRAIN Metastases to the Brain Join UCLA neurosurgeon Won Kim, MD, for an overview about assessing and diagnosing brain metastases and advancements in the field helping to treat patients today.
