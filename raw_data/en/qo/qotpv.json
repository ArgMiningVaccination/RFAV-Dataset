The implementation of an HPV vaccination register, either as part of an existing immunisation register or stand-alone, can add substantial benefits to an HPV vaccination program. In Australia, the National HPV Vaccination Program Register supports the HPV vaccination program by providing information to consumers and providers about incomplete courses as well as estimates of vaccination coverage by age and area. Future monitoring of vaccine effectiveness will be facilitated by cross-linking to Pap test registries. Additional keywords: genital warts, monitoring, papillomavirus.
