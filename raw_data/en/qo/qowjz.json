The daily mobility between pasture and water source, which is often specific to the season and the species of livestock. For example, during the hot dry season, sheep are watered every three to five days but camels can drink every eight to ten days. However, these intervals are longer during the cold dry season, when the temperature is lower. In this case, camels can drink every 10-15 days and, when feeding on the succulent plants of al gizu pastures in the far north, can remain without drinking for as long as 40 days. Water is a major expenditure during the dry season and securing it often involves laborious strategies as well as money. Therefore differences in water requirements (without a significant drop in performance or health) between different species and breeds (or between different strains of animals of the same breed) are carefully weighed by the producers against other possible benefits. The elaborate technical terminology to talk about watering and related mobility reflects the importance of the topic in the production system. The day the animals reach the water source is called fouge. The first night after drinking water is sadriya. The following day (the first day after watering) is ghawab. The days are then counted from here: rawabie is the second day in the pasture, thalatha is the third and so on, until the next fouge. Nujou. The long distance migrations from the main settlement to distant pasture are called nujou (for example the migration to gizu areas or to South Kordofan). This kind of mobility continues until the desired quality of pasture is found and in difficult circumstances can go on for the whole of the hot dry season. The leap towards the first green pasture at the time of the first showers (rushash) is called mirshishiya or showgara. For pastoralists, this is the most difficult time in the year as their animals, already weak from the long dry season, do not like to feed on wet straw and lose weight quickly before the new green fodder is available. Moutah. The migrations between the rainy-season temporary settlement (makharif) and the main settlement during the dry season. Al Nushouque. The mobility to better-quality pasture at the end of the rainy season, along the transhumance route (murhal). The range of this mobility extends to South and East Darfur and, in particularly good years when the succulent plants of the gizu are available, up to the border with Libya. The herders also distinguish between day-grazing (sarha) and night-grazing2. This concerns sheep especially, as camels do not normally graze at night except when the temperature is too high for grazing during the day. Although night-grazing does not directly describe a kind of mobility, it is indicative of its practice. Night-grazing is possible only when the animals can feed within a short distance from the camp and usually it involves moving around with the livestock placing the camp directly on the pasture site. After the first showers at the early stages of the rainy season, before the new grass, livestock prefer to feed on pasture untouched by the rain (still dry). During this period, camels would feed exclusively on trees if they are given the chance to do so. Once the last-year straw has been rained on, the herders call it by a different name: howaila. When on green fodder, livestock prefer younger plants over more 2 Night grazing is an important strategy for enhancing nutrition, as intake is higher during the hot dry season (when daytime temperature reduces appetite) and of better quality during the rainy season (because plants accumulate nutrients during the hours of light) (Auantunde et al 2000; Burns et al 2005). This is also well known to pastoralists elsewhere, for example the Fulani Wadaabe in Niger (Kr\u00e4tli and Schareika 2009). 8 mature plants, and thinly growing plants over thickly growing plants. Some of the preferred fodder plants are al sharaa'; al oram; al qutb; al haskaneet al raba; al nussi and al bayadh. These varieties are growing now, but other varieties that were preferred in the past have now disappeared. Sometimes the herd shows reluctance to move to another site and this behaviour has a name: al mashasha. Another term, al munakara, describes animals that lose interest in grazing and just stay put in one place (until they are taken to another pasture site). More than following rigid standards (for example based on predetermined judgements about the quality of certain pasture or certain sites) decisions concerning mobility are the result of day-to-day relationships between herders, animals and environment. It is the business of a good herder to monitor these relationships, for example whether the animals are grazing as much as they can and are benefiting (or not) from it. The diagrams below are simplified models of routine mobility for camels and sheep as described by Kababish producers. In the last diagram (kharif), 'water' is seasonal surface water rather than a permanent water point. The focus group with nomadic Shanabla in Abu Haraz produced the same model but with a slightly longer distance between camp and water point (up to seven kilometres). Figure 1. Camel system - Seasonal patterns of livestock mobility3 3 The directions in the diagrams do not represent the directions of the compass. 9 Cattle system (El Rahad) The cattle herders are on the move for most of the year. During the rainy season, cows and sheep are taken to the north, to an area called Abuelgor (east of El Obeid) where good quality pasture and free surface water are available. This migration, known as mossier, takes 7 to 15 days. The animals spend the rainy season there, leaving in September. Our informants emphasized that these two months when the animals can enjoy an exceptionally high-quality diet are crucial to their production system and even beneficial to the people who accompany the herds. During the hot dry season, some families with homes in North Kordofan used to migrate to the valleys in the Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan and even as far as Malakal in the present Southern Sudan (especially those with large herds). Once in the South, mobility depended on the arrangement with the local Omda and the availability of pasture. The Omda was normally presented with a gift, like a sheep, but not as a payment for renting the land. In good years the camp might not have to be moved at all for the whole of the dry season. In other cases the herders might have had to move to a different area and start a new negotiation. Going South meant that the household could stretch the production and management strategies characteristic of the end of the rainy season (deret) for the whole of the hot dry season (seyf). Following the conflict in South Kordofan and more recently the creation of the new international border, the producers in our sample had refrained from embarking on these long migrations. This shift in strategy came at the price of overcrowding with livestock the areas of the dry-season camps (Kewekaya and Engamina), more than the dry vegetation during the hot dry season can feed even in good years. As a consequence, herders further adjusted their mobility strategies. Now they take their animals north during the dry season, in search of suitable pasture, further than they ever used to go. However, this stretches to the maximum the distance from water sources. The households capable of sustaining the cost, take water to even more remote areas by cistern trucks. With this system, they can now reach places that could not be reached otherwise and where there is virtually no competition. Those who cannot afford this expense, however, face an additional stress threatening their livelihood security and an additional obstacle to recovering from a crisis. Some of the fodder plants preferred by cattle are ab In deret cattle prefer abumalih, hasskanet, omsher and a kind of wild rice. In the dry season, they like feeding on tree leaves, especially omdurab, kadad (Dichrostachys cinerea*) and omshihait. Sheep too have their preferences. During the rainy season the season immediately after the rains (deret) and the cold dry season that follows (shita) they prefer karkade (hibiscus), watermelon and some crop residues like groundnut and sorghum. However, during the hot dry season they too turn to trees, especially the fruits and pods (Cassia obtusiflora*) and sorghum threshing residues (gongot). 4 Wakeel and Sabah 1993. * Ibid. 10 Figure 2.

Camel system - Trend in herd dynamics Herd dynamics in the father's generation Herd dynamics today The natural growth of the herd was faster because: i. better access to good quality pasture enabled better animal nutrition (therefore faster reproduction rate); ii. fewer expenses to run the business meant that fewer animals had to be sold in order to run the pastoral enterprise; iii. mortality from diseases was lower. Reproduction rate in the herd is lower as: i. the quality of the best pasture herders are able to access (besides crises) is not as high as it used to be; ii. more animals have to be sold to run the pastoral enterprise to face the high costs of water, labour and forage; iii. animal diseases are more common and mortality is higher. Most of the herds grew only through new births (with the exception of very few wealthy families that supplied the export to Egypt and Libya and did already practise investment marketing). Slower reproduction rate is now offset (in wealthy households) by the larger market in productive livestock (from vulnerable households selling their capital stock). Productive livestock is purchased with the earnings from investment marketing and additional income from migrant labour (directly or via remittances) and mining. Marketing was limited to the periodic sales for culling purposes and covering household expenses, and investment marketing. Marketing of young and productive animals was exceptional. Beside culling and investment marketing, selling young animals (before optimal form) and capital stock (productive animals) is frequent. Table 4. Camel system - Seasonal patterns of income and expenditures Kharif Deret Shita Seyf Rushash Main source of income Selling a few animals according to need (especially old ewes and aging studs); animal products Investment marketing (male export animals): the highest concentration of income in the year Selling a few animals according to need (especially male lambs born in kharif and deret) Selling a few animals according to need (the remaining old ewes and more male lambs born during shita and deret) Selling a few animals according to need (the remaining male lambs born during shita and deret) Expenditure (in order of magnitude) Food items; people's medications Food items; medical treatment of animals; people's medications. Also ceremonies and other social events. Food items; medical treatment of animals; people's medications; items. Shepherds' salaries; fodder and forage, people's medications; medical treatment of animals. 14 Table 5. Camel system - Trend in household economy Previous generation (20 years ago) Today Production objective Self sufficiency and herd reconstruction (widespread poverty). Investment activities. Rearing of the herd Carried out mainly by adults only. All family members now contribute. Household materials Houses built by women with local materials such as leather, wool and camel hair products. Emergence of new fashions. Pastoralists rely on purchasing most of the materials. Livelihood necessities Very limited (e.g. millet, sorghum, oil, sugar, tea). All necessary items were purchased in one quota during deret season, with the money from the annual sale of livestock (jalab) at one of the big markets such as Omdurman. Millet was purchased directly from its production site and carried home on camel back (a practice called safoura). Numerous and now available in abundance at relatively close markets. Necessary items can be bought little by little throughout the year and sale of livestock follows the same pattern. More than an advantage, this is a necessity for households with relatively few assets. Today as in the past, wealthy households prefer to bulk-buy as in that way they can command better prices. Income sources Almost entirely livestock marketing; in some cases remittances from family members working abroad (but great poverty: money was mainly used for buying food). Livestock marketing, remittances from family members working abroad, trade, mining and sale of handicrafts. Youth needs Limited (e.g. clothing and marriage). Numerous and reflecting national changes in consumption towards relatively advanced technologies (e.g. vehicles, mobile phones, and radios). Some of them preferred to avoid schooling: 'you get a job but earn less than I could in pastoralism'. Others thought the opposite, including that school education could help them to be more successful as pastoralists. Household goods Simple and made from local materials e.g. palmwood beds, straw carpets and covers. More modernized e.g. iron beds, glassware and carpets. 15 Table 6. Sheep system - Seasonal calendar Season Expected period Characteristic features Kharif (rainy season) July to October The beginning of the yearly cycle of production. Livestock is moved around, targeting the new pasture. Animals only graze during the day and flocks are kept for no more than a week in one place. When rainfall is present but not adequately timed for production, this phenomenon is called aleina. When the livestock end up consuming all the pasture despite adequate rains, this is called mahal. Land is prepared for the sowing of groundnuts (weeding and ploughing). Deret (beginning of the dry season) November to December The animals graze during the night. Rains stop and the harvesting of crops begins. This is the season with the highest workload in these farming communities. Millet, watermelons and groundnuts are harvested. Groundnuts are dried for 15 days, cleaned and taken to the market. Families are occupied by cleaning hibiscus crops (karkade). Shita (cold dry season) December to March Livestock is watered from the concrete reservoirs (there are no natural reservoirs). The animals graze at night only. Harvesting of groundnuts, millet and watermelons. Seyf (hot dry season) March to June The animals graze during the night and rest during the day. The young animals born at this time are supplemented with crop residues (groundnut husks) and watermelons. Watering of animals is now the most demanding task (water is purchased). Even so, this is regarded as the season with the lowest workload. Harvesting of gum arabic by hired labour. Rushash (beginning of rainy season) Late May and early June Early rainfall and beginning of farming activities (e.g. sowing). Table 7. Sheep system, group of 'more secure'.

Cattle system - Seasonal calendar Season Expected period Characteristic features Seyf (hot dry season) January to May Highest temperature. Natural water sources (ruhood) and reservoirs are dry. Only poor quality pasture is available. Milk production drops as animals become weaker. Diseases appear in the herd. Sheep start mating in January. Building of dry season houses and digging of wells. Water is purchased. Rushash (beginning of rainy season) mid June to mid July Also referred to as showgara. First showers. Poor pasture but also appearance of new leaves on trees and short green grass that cows manage to feed on only by ingesting a lot of soil. This causes some diseases such as a stomach worm infestation known as hulaa. The herders detect it from the animals' faeces and bloat of the belly. Strong dusty wind. Preparation of the equipment for the rainy season camp: tarpaulins, collapsible beds and food. The household splits in two groups. Those in charge of the herds leave with the livestock, targeting new green pasture and free water. The people in charge of farming remain behind to clean up the fields and preparing them for sowing. Kharif (rainy season) mid July to mid September The herds are taken north, to large areas of pasture about 30-50 km east of El Obeid (e.g. Kubur Abuzeid, Alagbash and Abulgor). Each family uses its own routes. Heavy rains. Abundance of free water close to the green pasture. The most productive females start delivering. The others mate in this period. There is abundance of milk and extra income from its sale. Animals grazing day and night become healthy and put on weight. Litigations with farmers around issues of trespassing. Gallawy (end of rainy season) mid September to mid October End of the rains and beginning of the dry wind from North East (garwa). Based on the quality of the pasture now dry on the rangeland, the herders can now tell whether the rainy season was good or bad. The crops are mature. Deret (beginning of the dry season) mid September to mid November Animals and people are in good health (except for malaria). This is the time for social events and ceremonies (marriage, circumcision). The herders start taking their animals back south. More calving and high milk production. Harvest of crops at the dry-season camps of Koweykaya and Engamaina (sorghum, millet, sesame, groundnuts and hibiscus). Large sale of animals. Purchase of extra grain, clothes etc. Shita (cold dry season) mid November to mid March Collection of crop seeds and crop residues. The livestock at the camp is fed on crop residues, but the bulk of the herd is kept in the valleys of seasonal streams (kheiran, sing. khour), where the livestock can feed on green grass and use free water. Grazing in the kheiran needs close supervision to avoid animals falling into the water or trespassing into farms. This is the season in the year when the family has more opportunities to be reunited. 18 Table 10. Cattle system, both groups.
