Cancer is a tough opponent, but we at The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) are tougher. Our track record in accelerating lifesaving treatments is unparalleled, and we champion the most pioneering research to fuel our attack against cancer. We are laser-focused on cures, and we're relentless in supporting patients and their families throughout their cancer experience to ensure they have access to care. Our work is advancing breakthroughs for more than 1.3 million Americans living with or in remission from a blood cancer, and importantly, it is helping patients with other cancers and diseases. Nearly 70 years of fighting blood cancers has led us to a game changing belief. Beating cancer is in our blood. With your support, we are transforming this powerful belief in finding cures into reality for more patients. Gratefully, Louis J. DeGennaro, Ph.D. President & Chief Executive Officer Peter Brock Chairman of the Board ANNUAL REPORT 2018 4OUR IMPACT AT A GLANCE Here at LLS, we have a bold vision: a world without blood cancers. The impact that we are making on the lives of patients and their families gives us confidence that we will achieve this goal in our lifetime. Our incredible progress this year puts us at the forefront of the fight to cure cancer. LLS achieved a record fundraising year, generating almost $450 million in revenue that allowed us to invest even more in our mission and help more patients. Our record success is driving innovation across the cancer landscape. Revolutionary new treatments, originally discovered through blood cancer research, are now being tested in clinical trials for other cancers. Not only is the blood an important starting place to find cures for cancer, but it is in our DNA - it is what we do at LLS every day. That's why we are the only organization that can say proudly SECTION 1ANNUAL REPORT 2018 58 HIGHLIGHTS OF 2018 THANKS TO YOU, LLS HAS: RAISED THE BAR FOR PEER-TO-PEER FUNDRAISING Together, participants across all of our campaigns helped us raise a record-breaking total of more than $250 million.

ENGAGED THE NEXT GENERATION OF PHILANTHROPIC LEADERS Through LLS's newest innovation in fundraising, Students of the Year, more than 600 motivated high school student teams raised significant funds for our mission. ADVANCED NEW TREATMENTS FOR PATIENTS WITH CANCER LLS helped advance 34 of the 39 blood cancer treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2017. FUNDED THE MOST VISIONARY CANCER RESEARCH WORLDWIDE Our $188 million multi-year research commitment spans the most promising science across all blood cancers, including immunotherapy, genomics and personalized medicine. EXPANDED CLINICAL TRIAL EDUCATION AND ENROLLMENT LLS Information Specialists responded to nearly 20,000 inquiries from patients and caregivers, including inquiries about clinical trials. LLS Clinical Trial Support Center (CTSC) nurses provided 562 patients with in-depth clinical trial navigation and support - up 65 percent from 2017. PROVIDED DIRECT SUPPORT TO PATIENTS IMPACTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS We committed up to $1 million in aid to support blood cancer patients impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and California wildfires. MADE OUR VOICES HEARD ON BEHALF OF CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS More than 100,000 volunteer advocates across the country acted as a powerful voice for cancer patients and survivors to influence change at the state and federal level. ACHIEVED A MAJOR WIN FOR DEDICATED PEDIATRIC CANCER RESEARCH Our Office of Public Policy, along with LLS volunteer advocates, sent thousands of letters to help pass into law The Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research (STAR) Act, the most comprehensive federal childhood cancer legislation ever introduced.FUNDRAISING PATIENT SUPPORT & EDUCATIONRESEARCH POLICY & ADVOCACYSECTION 1: Our Impact at a GlanceOUR MISSION At LLS, our mission is to cure leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and myeloma, and improve the quality of life of patients and their families. As the world's largest nonprofit dedicated to fighting blood cancers, our work has helped millions impacted by cancer. Though LLS is known for funding groundbreaking research to find better treatments and cures, we do so much more. We provide free information, education and support services for those who are newly diagnosed and those living with their disease. We fight for lifesaving policy changes at the state and federal level to ensure access to quality, affordable, coordinated care. We are committed to working tirelessly toward our mission every single day, until we find cures. Dr . Gwen Nichols Chief Medical Officer The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society ANNUAL REPORT 2018 6SECTION 2ANNUAL REPORT 2018 7RESEARCH Contributing to nearly every advancement in blood cancer treatment in recent decades, LLS is the largest nonprofit funder of cutting-edge blood cancer research to advance cures. In fact, we have invested more than $1.2 billion in cancer research since we started in 1949, leading to breakthroughs in immunotherapy, genomics and personalized medicine that are improving and saving the lives of patients. SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l RESEARCH Jessica, Cancer SurvivorANNUAL REPORT 2018 8 Our robust research portfolio supports the careers of next- generation scientists, advances research in areas of urgent, unmet medical need, and drives forward lifesaving discoveries through impactful collaborations.INVESTI NG IN GROUNDBREAKING CANCER RESEARCHSECTION 2: OUR MISSION l RESEARCHSince 1949, The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) has invested more than $1.2 billion in cutting-edge cancer research, funding nearly all of today's most promising treatments and bringing us closer to cures. We support the most outstanding scientists and physicians around the world. RESEARCH IN NUMBERS In 2018, we supported more than 235 research grants and 20 Therapy Acceleration Program\u00ae (TAP) partnerships, a $188 million multi-year commitment. This year, LLS dedicated $46 million to support scientific grants, including 87 new grants awarded in 2018 alone to researchers across nine countries, making us the largest nonprofit funder of blood cancer research. We invest in pioneering researchers whose work runs the gamut from basic, laboratory-based science to large-scale clinical trials, and many of our grants sustain their projects over multiple years. Through TAP, we partner directly with biotechnology companies and renowned academic centers to help accelerate the development of promising therapies. This year, we invested $6.4 million of our 2018 research budget in our TAP program. Now in its eleventh year, TAP is currently supporting 20 partnerships. While incredible progress has been made, challenges remain. More than one-third of blood cancer patients still do not survive five years after their diagnosis. By funding the most innovative research, we will achieve breakthroughs faster for patients who urgently need them. In the past year, LLS's Therapy Acceleration Program\u00ae (TAP) achieved an important milestone when three therapies were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat blood cancers with high unmet medical need. What's more, two of these therapies are now approved for use in the European Union - highlighting the global impact that we are making in the fight against cancer. CPX-351 (Vyxeos) , funded by TAP since 2009, was approved for the treatment of patients with certain types of high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta\u00ae) , funded by TAP since 2015, the first FDA-approved CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T-cell immunotherapy for types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. tagraxofusp (Elzonris) , funded by TAP since 2013, became the first FDA-approved treatment for adults and pediatric patients age two or older with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), a particularly aggressive and rare disease.SPOTLIGHT ON TAPSECTION 2: OUR MISSION l RESEARCH l Investing in Groundbreaking Cancer ResearchANNUAL REPORT 2018 10WE ARE ELEVATING THE GAME CHANGING FIELD OF IMMUNOTHERAPY TO NEW HEIGHTS Recognizing the tremendous potential of immunotherapy, LLS was an early supporter of research in the field and has played a pivotal role in driving its development. From CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T-cell immunotherapy and cancer vaccines to monoclonal antibodies, LLS is committed to advancing the next generation of these groundbreaking therapies to improve the lives of patients. ERIC SMITH, MD, PHD Eric Smith, MD, PhD, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), is focused on optimizing CAR T-cell immunotherapy for myeloma. Despite recent advances, almost all patients experience relapse or treatment resistance. To address this, Dr. Smith is engineering CAR T-cells to attack a protein called BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen), found on the surface of myeloma cells. Dr. Smith is part of a larger initiative at MSKCC under the guidance of Anas Younes, MD, Michel Sadelain MD, PhD and Renier Brentjens, MD, PhD to apply the latest CAR T-cell technology across many different blood cancers. FORTY SEVEN, INC. Forty Seven, Inc., a Silicon Valley biotech startup in our TAP portfolio, is working on a promising experimental immunotherapy for patients with some types of lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and solid tumors. The therapy works by disarming a protein that emits a \"don't eat me\" signal. Under normal conditions, the cancer cells would evade destruction, but in the presence of an antibody, immune cells ingest and destroy tumor cells. The program grew out of grants funded by LLS at Stanford University. SHANNON ODA, P hD Shannon Oda, PhD, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, is focused on enhancing T-cell immunotherapy for AML by studying how to overcome the obstacles that make some patients resistant to the treatment . ROBERT ORLOWSKI, MD, P hD Robert Orlowski, MD, PhD, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, is leading a world-class team of researchers to develop new immunotherapeutic and targeted approaches for the treatment of patients with high-risk subtypes of myeloma.SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l RESEARCH l Investing in Groundbreaking Cancer Research \"I am grateful to LLS for funding my research and also providing opportunities to meet patients and hear their stories. The work done by this organization is truly inspiring and I am proud to contribute to the research toward better blood cancer therapies.\" DR. SHANNON ODAEMIL Y A groundbreaking immunotherapy saves young mother's life Emily, a 32-year-old mother of three young children, was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in August 2013. After a whirlwind of intense treatments over the next two years including chemotherapy, a stem cell transplant and months of hospitalization, Emily relapsed soon after each treatment. In April 2015, Emily was given a devastating prognosis - doctors said she had six months to live. But then Emily received a glimmer of hope when doctors told her of a potential new treatment. In July 2015, Emily became the third patient in the world enrolled in Kite Pharma's clinical trial for a lifesaving treatment called CAR T-cell immunotherapy that was made possible by LLS funding. The revolutionary therapy was a success - Emily has been in remission for more than three years! Today, she enjoys spending time with her family, and has been working with LLS to raise awareness about blood cancers and raise funds for groundbreaking research so other mothers do not experience what she did. ANNUAL REPORT 2018 11SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l RESEARCH l Investing in Groundbreaking Cancer ResearchANNUAL REPORT 2018 12WE ARE OUTSMARTING CANCER WITH PRECISION MEDICINE Cancer is not a one-size-fits-all disease. By supporting advanced genomics and molecular research, we are ushering in a new era of cancer treatment that centers on giving the right treatment to the right patient at the right time. TIMOTHY LEY, MD Timothy Ley, MD, Washington University School of Medicine, who led the team that sequenced the first cancer genome, is using genomic technology to identify genetic markers that can predict which patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are more likely to relapse, with the goal of developing new approaches to target these mutations. STEPHEN NIMER, MD Stephen Nimer, MD, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, is driving a collaborative effort focused on advancing knowledge of the small chemical changes that regulate gene behavior. Dr. Nimer and his team are studying how to target epigenetic abnormalities to develop new therapies for AML, myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). hD, MSC, FAA Andreas Strasser, PhD, MSc, FAA, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Australia, is leading an ambitious project centered on apoptosis, the normal process that causes impaired cells to self-destruct. The team is testing new approaches to boost apoptosis in leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma and was instrumental in developing the first approved apoptosis-targeted therapy, called venetoclax, for use in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and, more recently, for elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CONSTANTINE MITSIADES, MD, P hD Constantine Mitsiades, MD, PhD, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, is applying cutting-edge CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to the study of myeloma. Dr. Mitsiades and his team aim to characterize which genes play an essential role in the survival and growth of myeloma cells, with the goal of uncovering new therapeutic targets to optimize treatment.SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l RESEARCH l Investing in Groundbreaking Cancer Research \"Our team of researchers and clinicians are grateful to The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society for their continued support. The generous and long-term funding from LLS has permitted us to pursue broad-ranging research underpinning new therapies for cancer.\" DR. ANDREAS STRASSERWE ARE IMPROVING CARE AND CURES FOR CHILDREN WITH BLOOD CANCERS Dedicated pediatric cancer research is needed urgently to understand these diseases, improve care and evaluate the long-term impact of treatment. To this end, LLS is committed to accelerating the most impactful pediatric cancer research. This is just one part of our multi-pronged approach to address the unique needs of pediatric patients, which also includes education and support services for children and their families and advocacy efforts to increase pediatric cancer research funding. BARBARA SAVOLDO, MD, P hD Barbara Savoldo, MD, PhD, University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, is developing an experimental CAR T-cell immunotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common cancer in children, that would include a built-in \"safety switch\" to help safeguard against potential side effects of the treatment. ADOLFO FERRANDO, MD, P hD Adolfo Ferrando, MD, PhD, Columbia University Medical Center, is studying the genetic mutations responsible for pediatric ALL, particularly those that cause resistance to commonly used chemotherapies. For the 15-20 percent of children whose disease relapses, new treatments are desperately needed. Dr. Ferrando is advancing critical knowledge of the mechanisms of resistance, paving the way for more precisely targeted therapies. SOHEIL MESHINCHI, MD, P hD Soheil Meshinchi, MD, PhD, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, is working to expand knowledge of genomic characteristics that are unique to pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), one of the most challenging childhood cancers to treat. His team has identified a potential biomarker for pediatric AML called mesothelin - opening the door to new targeted therapies for young patients with relapsed disease.SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l RESEARCH l Investing in Groundbreaking Cancer Research ANNUAL REPORT 2018 13 \"I do not remember ever wanting to be anything else. My father was a doctor, and growing up, I became passionate about medicine. Leukemia research is as much of who I am as almost anything else.\" DR. ADOLFO FERRANDO, ON BECOMING A SCIENTISTEight-year-old Kaitlyn has had to deal with cancer for most of her young life. In fact, she was only 18 months old when she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Throughout all of her treatments, doctors' visits and hospital stays, Kaitlyn was her brave and positive self, and continued to pursue her passion for cheerleading and dancing. \"As a parent, if your child is scared, you want to be the one they reach for. You're conditioned to think that you're the brave one,\" says her father, James. \"But, when your kid touches your hand in that moment of fear and comforts you, you realize that they are the reason you're strong.\" After three years, chemotherapy stopped working for Kaitlyn. That's when her doctor recommended a clinical trial for a revolutionary CAR T-cell immunotherapy, which LLS invested in for over two decades. In February 2015, Kaitlyn and her parents traveled nearly 1,500 miles from their home in Texas to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in Pennsylvania, where she received the lifesaving treatment. Today, the third grader is cancer free, and back to cheerleading.KAITL YN Diagnosed with leukemia as an infant, 8-year-old Kaitlyn is cancer free ANNUAL REPORT 2018 14SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l RESEARCH l Investing in Groundbreaking Cancer ResearchANNUAL REPORT 2018 15WE ARE INVESTING IN PIONEERING PREVENTION RESEARCH Today, there are no means of preventing blood cancers, but thanks to advancements in genomics and our rapidly growing understanding of the biology of cancer, LLS plans to change this. Early detection of cancers in people before they develop blood cancer or after they have achieved remission will lead to earlier interventions. LUCY GODLEY, MD, P hD Lucy Godley, MD, PhD, The University of Chicago, is working to uncover the pathways that drive disease development in cancer-prone families. Once considered extremely rare, inherited forms of leukemia and lymphoma are much more common than previously thought. Discovery of these pathways will allow researchers to devise strategies to delay cancer progression or prevent it altogether. IRENE GHOBRIAL, MD Irene Ghobrial, MD, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, is focused on transforming the treatment of myeloma through the early detection of precursor blood conditions. Dr. Ghobrial has received numerous LLS grants throughout her career as well as funding through TAP to support her visionary research on treatment strategies that can prevent these conditions from progressing to more serious cancers.SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l RESEARCH l Investing in Groundbreaking Cancer Research \"What makes LLS so unique is that they really think about the impact of research on patient care. We work closely with LLS to develop and expand our ideas, and LLS helps bring our work from the lab to the clinic. This makes a difference for patients every day. With support from LLS, I was able to open a clinic for patients with precursor conditions of myeloma\"DR. IRENE GHOBRIALANNUAL REPORT 2018 16Our support of innovative blood cancer research is breaking new ground in the fight against cancer. For example, we helped pioneer CAR T-cell immunotherapy, a game changing treatment approach now being tested in more than 500 clinical trials for other cancers.

Dr. Ebert's research went even deeper: his lab was the first to demonstrate that these mutations are also associated with the development of cardiovascular disease. The discovery opens up the possibility of preventative medicine to identify people at risk of developing disease years before it occurs and ultimately, devise treatment strategies to mitigate the risk. ANNUAL REPORT 2018 18SELINA CHEN-KIANG, P hD Weill Cornell Medicine, discovered an innovative treatment approach that is helping both blood and breast cancer patients. While her work is focused on myeloma and lymphoma, Dr. Chen-Kiang's discovery that a targeted therapy was effective in blocking an enzyme responsible for the division and proliferation of cancer cells, helped lead the way to that therapy, palbociclib, receiving approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2015 for breast cancer. With LLS support, Dr. Chen-Kiang is leading a cutting-edge research team to test palbociclib's effectiveness in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). RON LEVY , MD Stanford University, pioneered a treatment approach that uses the body's immune system to develop antibodies against invading tumor cells. His foundational work resulted in the FDA approval of the first monoclonal antibody to treat cancer, rituximab, in 1997, which is now used to treat many lymphomas and rheumatoid arthritis. Today, Dr. Levy is moving immunotherapy in a bold direction. With support from LLS's Therapy Acceleration Program (TAP), he is testing an experimental, immune-boosting vaccine among patients with lymphoma - an approach that also shows promise for breast, colon and melanoma cancers.

After losing her father, Valerie became even more committed to making a difference. She continued to volunteer through LLS's Palm Beach Area Chapter and in 2010, she won Palm Beach Woman of the Year after an intense 10-week fundraising campaign. Then, five years ago, Valerie was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. She was prescribed alemtuzumab - the same treatment that her father had taken for CLL. This targeted therapy, first approved by the FDA to treat patients with CLL in 2001, is also approved for patients with multiple sclerosis who have relapsed after previous treatment. Today, Valerie is doing well and still runs marathons.

ANNUAL REPORT 2018 21SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l RESEARCH l Bringing Precision Medicine to AML PatientsANNUAL REPORT 2018 22 GOING ON THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most lethal blood cancers that takes more than 10,000 lives in the U.S. each year. While therapies for other blood cancers have made remarkable leaps forward, the standard of care for AML - a combination of toxic chemotherapies - has changed very little over the past four decades. Until now. Advancements in genomics and precision medicine are fueling a renaissance in AML research. Today, we know that AML is not a single disease, but rather a group of more than 10 subtypes and other rare mutations. Once an elusive enemy, researchers are now able to identify and target these specific subtypes, and nine new therapies - all advanced with LLS support - have been added to our arsenal in the past two years, following approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Still, much work remains. Only about one in four AML patients survives five years after diagnosis. LLS is leading the charge against AML through the Beat AML\u00ae Master Clinical Trial, a collaborative clinical trial that aims to change the paradigm of treatment through a precision medicine approach. The Beat AML\u00ae Master Clinical Trial is the first collaborative precision medicine clinical trial in a blood cancer. The trial uses advanced genomic technology to identify each patient's cancer-driving genetic mutations, and then matches patients to the most promising, targeted treatment. While a typical clinical trial studies one drug or one combination of drugs, we are testing multiple therapies in multiple study arms simultaneously. This Master Trial protocol\u2014developed with guidance from the FDA\u2014not only has the power to bring new therapies to AML patients faster, but also has the potential to stand as a model for future clinical trials for other cancers.HOW IS THE BEAT AML\u00ae MASTER CLINICAL TRIAL TRANSFORMING AML TREATMENT?SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l RESEARCH l Bringing Precision Medicine to AML PatientsANNUAL REPORT 2018 23LLS IS LEADING THE CHARGE AGAINST AML LLS is bringing together the best and brightest minds across the cancer ecosystem, including three world-renowned scientists who are leading the trial: Brian Druker, MD, The Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University; John Byrd, MD, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center; and Ross Levine, MD, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Additionally, multiple pharmaceutical companies, prominent scientists at top cancer centers, several technology companies and the FDA join us in a shared commitment to bring the promise of precision medicine to AML patients. Beat AML Master Clinical Trial SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l RESEARCH l Bringing Precision Medicine to AML PatientsANNUAL REPORT 2018 24WHY IS THE BEAT AML\u00ae MASTER CLINICAL TRIAL SO GROUNDBREAKING? To bring new and better treatments to AML patients in urgent need, we need to think and act boldly. A FIRST FOR LLS: Given our leadership in AML research - one-quarter of our annual research funding is dedicated to AML - as well as our commitment to putting patients at the forefront, LLS is uniquely qualified to drive this powerful collaboration. In fact, LLS is the first nonprofit health organization to sponsor a cancer clinical trial. A FOCUS ON NEWL Y DIAGNOSED PATIENTS: Most AML clinical trials center on patients who have relapsed or not responded to other treatments. This trial focuses on newly diagnosed, untreated patients aged 60 or older - allowing researchers to identify genetic mutations early and offering a better chance for successful treatment . AN UNPRECEDENTED GENOMIC SCREENING TURNAROUND: Because AML progresses so quickly, patients need to be treated based on their particular subtype right away. For this trial, advanced genomic screening is being completed within seven days, an unparalleled timeframe. WHAT DID THE BEAT AML\u00ae MASTER CLINICAL TRIAL ACHIEVE IN 2018? The Beat AML \u00ae Master Clinical Trial continued to exceed expectations in 2018 as more patients and collaborators joined the fold. More than 400 patients are enrolled in over 10 study arms at more than a dozen prestigious cancer centers across the country, including UCLA Health, Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University. More than six pharmaceutical companies are providing their innovative investigational therapies. The trial continues to gain momentum, with the goal of enrolling 1,000 patients at 15-20 cancer centers.SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l RESEARCH l Bringing Precision Medicine to AML PatientsTHANKS TO OUR BEAT AML\u00ae SUPPORTERS $10 million+: Mangurian, Jr. Foundation $1 million - $9,999,999: Babich Family Foundation and Trust Drenda Vijuk $500,000 - $999,999: Pamela B.

This year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 21 treatment options for patients who urgently needed them. What's more, LLS helped advance 19 of these advancements. CAR T -CELL IMMUNOTHERAPY CONTINUES TO SHOW PROMISE In 2017, we witnessed an historic victory for cancer patients when two revolutionary CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T-cell immunotherapies were approved by the FDA, ushering in a new era in the treatment of cancer. This game changing approach involves genetically reprogramming a patient's own immune cells to find and attack cancer cells. LLS supported the development of both therapies, which mark incredible progress for patients who have otherwise run out of treatment options: tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah\u00ae) for children and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta\u00ae) for adults with several types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In 2018, the FDA granted tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah\u00ae) its second approval, bringing a new treatment option to patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a particularly aggressive disease. In fact, only about half of the 27,000 newly diagnosed patients in the U.S. each year will achieve long-lasting disease control. Over the past two decades, LLS has invested more than $40 million in research at multiple institutions to advance CAR T-cell therapy for blood cancer - paving the way for research applications for solid tumors, such as cancers of the lung, breast, colon and prostate. LLS-funded research is making a global impact on the lives of patients: both CAR T-cell therapies are now approved for use in the European Union. We continue to invest in the most innovative science worldwide to make CAR T-cell therapies safer and more effective for more patients and easier to produce . > DOWNLOAD FULL INFOGRAPHIC HERESECTION 2: OUR MISSION l RESEARCH l Advancing New Lifesaving Therapies ANNUAL REPORT 2018 29ADVANCEMENTS IN PRECISION MEDICINE FOR ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA Precision medicine centers on giving the right treatment to the right patient at the right time based on their genetic information and other characteristics. We are beginning to crack the code to apply precision medicine to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), one of the most daunting challenges in the blood cancers. Each year, about 20,000 Americans are diagnosed with AML, and half of these patients are expected to have exceptionally poor outcomes. Standard treatment has typically involved intensive chemotherapy, followed by a stem cell transplant in some cases. But this approach fails most patients, the majority of whom are older adults who cannot tolerate the intensity of treatment. With more than one-quarter of our research budget invested in AML, LLS is leading the charge to address this urgent, unmet need. Our work is paying off. Researchers are now able to home in on specific genetic drivers of the disease - opening the door to a more personalized approach to treatment. In 2018 alone, the FDA approved five new treatments for AML, and LLS helped advance all of these somewhere along their development journey: ivosidenib (Tibsovo\u00ae) , a new targeted therapy, was approved for patients with relapsed or refractory AML who have a certain genetic mutation called IDH1. arsenic trioxide (Trisenox\u00ae) , an existing drug, was approved in combination with chemotherapy for newly diagnosed adult patients with low-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). glasdegib (Daurismo\u00ae) , a new therapy, has been approved in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed adult patients with AML who are age 75 or older or who have other chronic health conditions or diseases that might preclude the use of intensive chemotherapy. The therapy targets a cell signaling pathway called Hedgehog, which is critical for the development of immature cells into cells with more specialized functions. venetoclax (Venclexta\u00ae) , an existing therapy, is now approved in combination with chemotherapy, for the treatment of newly diagnosed adult patients with AML who are age 75 or older or who have other chronic health conditions or diseases that might preclude the use of intensive chemotherapy. gilteritinib (Xospata\u00ae) , a new therapy, was approved for patients with relapsed or refractory AML, who have a genetic mutation called FLT3, which is seen in about one-third of AML patients. Further, our groundbreaking precision medicine Beat AML\u00ae Master Clinical Trial is testing ivosidenib and gilteritinib as first-line treatments for newly diagnosed patients. We continue to fund the most promising AML research, and we provide education and support to patients and caregivers. After four decades and millions of dollars invested, we are seeing results for AML patients that give us a real reason for optimism.SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l RESEARCH l Advancing New Lifesaving TherapiesANNUAL REPORT 2018 30 Dustin was supposed to get married on December 3, 2016, but cancer turned his life upside down. Six days before his wedding, 31-year-old Dustin was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Dustin and his fianc\u00e9e, KT, stayed at the hospital for 33 days, where he underwent medical tests and began treatment. The couple canceled their wedding, and navigated finances and other aspects of their relationship while Dustin underwent eight months of chemotherapy. When Dustin and KT got married on May 7, 2017, their special day was even more meaningful. \"Getting through a little bit of the worse together means appreciating the better even more,\" they say. Today, Dustin is cancer free and credits research funded through LLS for saving his life. Because of advances in diagnosis and treatment, APL has been transformed from the most fatal to the most curable form of acute leukemia in adults.DUSTIN A cancer survivor reflects on marriage after cancerSECTION 2: OUR MISSION l RESEARCH l Advancing New Lifesaving TherapiesANNUAL REPORT 2018 31IMPORTANT PROGRESS FOR UL TRA-RARE DISEASES Ultra-rare diseases represent fewer than 1,000 cases in the U.S. per year. While the numbers are relatively small, the impact of these diseases is devastating for patients and their families. Many ultra-rare cancers are difficult to diagnose and remain incurable, and approved treatment options might not exist in some cases. Recent advancements in personalized medicine are driving more opportunities to bring much needed treatment breakthroughs to patients with ultra-rare diseases, including: Tagraxofusp (Elzonris) a new treatment, was approved for adults and pediatric patients age two or older with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), an aggressive, deadly disease that lacked a standard of care. LLS sponsored clinical trials for this novel targeted therapy through our Therapy Acceleration Program (TAP). Nilotinib (Tasigna\u00ae) , an existing therapy, was approved to treat children with a rare type of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase. CML is rare in children, accounting for only about 3.1 percent of new cases of leukemia in children and young adults younger than 20 years. Mogamulizumab-kpkc (Poteligeo\u00ae) , a new therapy, was approved for two rare types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: mycosis fungoides (MF) and S\u00e9zary syndrome (SS), giving MF patients a new treatment option and marking the first FDA approval of a drug specifically for SS. Moxetumomab pasudotox (Lumoxiti\u00ae) , a new, first-in-class immunotoxin, was approved for patients with relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukemia (HCL), a rare, incurable, slow-growing disease. While many patients initially respond to previously approved treatment, up to 40 percent relapse, underscoring the need for more innovative therapies.

This year alone, LLS Information Specialists responded to nearly 20,000 inquiries from patients and caregivers, guiding them to our wide array of education and support services. Myrrah, leukemia survivorSECTION 2: OUR MISSION l EDUCATION & SUPPORTANNUAL REPORT 2018 34Dealing with a cancer diagnosis, treatment or long- term survival issues can be overwhelming. Blood cancers are complex diseases, and treatment options are evolving at a faster pace than ever. Each day, we hear from patients and their families about the unique challenges they face, from coping with side effects to determining how to cover the cost of their care. We at LLS believe that no one should have to face cancer alone. LLS is the leading source of free blood cancer information, education and support for patients, survivors, caregivers, families and healthcare professionals. We are committed to patients and caregivers from the time of diagnosis and throughout their cancer experience, ensuring they have access to quality, affordable and coordinated care. WE ARE REACHING MORE PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS WHEN THEY NEED IT MOST For more than 20 years, LLS Information Specialists have been on the front lines of helping patients and caregivers navigate their treatments and countless emotional, financial and social challenges. This year alone, Information Specialists responded to nearly 20,000 inquiries, connecting with patients and caregivers one-on-one and guiding them to our wide array of support services that can help. LLS Information Specialists are master's level oncology social workers, nurses and health educators who work with compassion to provide blood cancer patients and caregivers free personalized support, information and resources, tailored to their specific diagnosis and needs. They speak in-depth with caregivers and patients - many of them newly diagnosed - about their disease, clinical trials, financial resources, how to talk to their physicians and so much more. Information Specialists are ready to help by phone at (800) 955-4572 , and live chat or email via www.LLS.org .Why is it so important to help patients and families soon after diagnosis? A cancer diagnosis can bring a range of emotions and feel overwhelming. Patients and families are looking for answers, but might not know what questions to ask or where to start. By reaching patients and their loved ones soon after diagnosis, we can help them become active participants in their care, as they work with their healthcare teams to make the best decisions for them. What was the most rewarding aspect of your work this year? I'm inspired by the transformations I see, as patients who first connect with our Information Specialists evolve into \"experts\" who are truly part of the decision-making process with their healthcare teams. Through this transformation, many patients and family members go on to volunteer with LLS and provide hope to others. What do you wish more people realized about LLS's efforts to help patients and families? LLS is here for you and your loved ones throughout your cancer experience. We have so many resources that can help, and we're only a phone call away. And you can join our efforts - nearly 8,000 volunteers across the country provide direct support to patients and families in their communities, and this support makes all the difference.Meredith Barnhart Director, Information Resource Center ANNUAL REPORT 2018 35WE ARE DEDICATED TO EXPANDING CLINICAL TRIAL EDUCATION AND ENROLLMENT Survival rates for many blood cancer patients have doubled, tripled or even quadrupled since the 1960s, thanks to breakthroughs in cancer treatment that were made possible by clinical trials. Enrolling in a clinical trial might be the best treatment option for certain patients. That's why LLS continues to expand our Clinical Trial Support Center (CTSC), in which specially trained nurses help patients find and enroll in clinical trials based on highly detailed, individualized assessments. Together, our CTSC nurses and Information Specialists guide patients and caregivers through the clinical trial process, providing them with the information and support they need to overcome barriers to enrolling, including help with finances and lodging. This year, CTSC nurses provided 562 patients with in-depth clinical trial navigation and support - up an incredible 65 percent from 2017. Even more promising: three out of five patients who were assisted by the CTSC and medically eligible enrolled in an appropriate clinical trial. By taking part in clinical trials, patients help advance our knowledge of cancer and pave the way for better care for future patients. Contact an Information Specialist at 800-955-4572 to learn more. SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l EDUCATION & SUPPORTANNUAL REPORT 2018 36 In 2010, Josh was with his wife on their honeymoon when he noticed a bean-sized lump on the back of his neck. After being misdiagnosed twice, Josh was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma (FL) at the age of 49. For several years, he was treated with an array of different therapy regimens. However, he continued to relapse and the FL ended up transforming into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). With the help of LLS's Clinical Trial Support Center and his oncologist, Josh enrolled in a clinical trial for CAR T-cell immunotherapy in June 2016. Today, the 57-year-old professional photographer is cancer-free and remains an avid surfer. In addition to receiving help from LLS to enroll in this clinical trial, Josh later realized that LLS played an instrumental role in advancing his therapy, investing $2.5 million in this innovative clinical trial. In fact, over the past two decades, LLS has provided $40 million in funding to develop this revolutionary approach to treating cancer and history was made in 2017 when two LLS-funded CAR T-cell immunotherapies were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.JOSH An avid surfer returns to the board thanks to LLS's clinical trial support centerSECTION 2: OUR MISSION l EDUCATION & SUPPORTANNUAL REPORT 2018 37WE ARE MAKING AN IMPACT THROUGH TRUSTED EDUCATION RESOURCES AND PROGRAMS The healthcare landscape is constantly changing. LLS recognizes that knowledge is power, so we offer a variety of educational resources and programs to help patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals stay informed and up to date. This year, LLS: Distributed more than 600,000 educational booklets and fact sheets about specific diseases. Educated over 130,000 patients, caregivers, healthcare professionals and others - a 44 percent increase over 2017 - through live web-based and local in-person programs. Convened 10 regional Blood Cancer Conferences with over 3,000 patients in attendance. Launched a new podcast, The Bloodline with LLS, which has reached more than 7,000 listeners and covered a range of topics that matter most to patients and caregivers, from cancer-related fatigue to communicating effectively with cancer care teams. WE ARE CONNECTING PATIENTS AND FAMILIES TO CRITICAL SUPPORT Personal connections and one-on-one support can make all the difference in the lives of cancer patients and their families. As a voluntary, community-based health organization, we have regional and local chapters throughout the United States and Canada to reach patients and their families in every community. We also give patients and caregivers a comfortable, welcoming place to connect online through LLS Community, where they can find support, access the latest disease and treatment information and engage with trained LLS staff. LLS offers a variety of ways for patients and caregivers to find connections and support. This year, LLS: Connected 1,315 volunteers with patients and caregivers diagnosed with the same disease through LLS's Patti Robinson Kaufmann First Connection Program . Facilitated 113 support groups in local communities and online led by nurses and social workers. Reached more than 8,000 patients and caregivers through LLS Community, an online social network that provides education and support.SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l EDUCATION & SUPPORTANNUAL REPORT 2018 38WE ARE BREAKING DOWN FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO CARE We are dedicated to helping patients and families cope with the often insurmountable financial burden that cancer brings. This year, about one-third of inquiries to LLS's Information Specialists were from patients with financial issues and questions. In addition to our advocacy efforts to fight the rising cost of cancer care, we provide programs, resources and financial assistance to help patients in need with cancer-related expenses. This year, LLS: Provided $108 million in co-pay financial assistance supporting over 32,000 patients. Provided $529,000 through our Susan Lang Pay-It-Forward Patient Travel Assistance Program, which provided 1,176 blood cancer patients with assistance for ground transportation, air travel, and lodging related expenses. Committed up to $1 million in aid to support blood cancer patients impacted by natural disasters, including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, as well as wild fires in California. As an organization that unapologetically puts patients at the forefront, LLS stepped in to help nearly 1,600 blood cancer patients and families in crisis, providing direct financial support for treatment-related travel, replacement medications and other needs. SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l EDUCATION & SUPPORTWhen Barbara was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) at fifty years old in 1993, she faced serious financial burdens - she was unable to continue to work as a dietitian and could not afford the cost of her treatment. During that time, she reached out to LLS and received financial assistance through its Co-pay Assistance Program and Susan Lang Pay-It-Forward Patient Travel Assistance Program. After receiving immunotherapy and chemotherapy treatment, she went into remission in 2010. Today, she spends her time giving back as a longtime volunteer for LLS's Patti Robinson Kaufmann First Connection Program , a peer- to-peer program that matches patients and their families with trained volunteers who have had similar experiences. Recently, she needed help again - and LLS was there for her. When Hurricane Irma hit her hometown of Orlando, Florida in 2017, she lost electricity in her apartment for several days, and the food in her fridge spoiled. She applied for LLS's Hurricane Relief Program and received $500 so she could re-stock her fridge with nutritious food. Barbara says she is extremely grateful that LLS has supported her many times throughout the years, and that's why she continues to give back to LLS today.BARBARA After receiving LLS financial assistance, a cancer survivor gives back ANNUAL REPORT 2018 39SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l EDUCATION & SUPPORTANNUAL REPORT 2018 40WE ARE HELPING CANCER PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES Eating well during and after cancer treatment can help patients feel better, maintain their strength, avoid treatment delays and speed recovery. Cancer changes patients' nutritional needs, and sorting through the vast amount of nutrition information online is a daunting task. To help cancer patients and caregivers find reliable nutrition advice and resources, LLS now offers free one-on-one nutrition consultations with a registered dietitian with expertise in oncology nutrition. This year, nearly 1,000 patients and caregivers received nutrition consultations. Caregiving can be a demanding role, but is better managed with careful planning, good self-care and knowledge of available help. LLS is here to help. We offer a wide range of resources, information and support that help both patients and caregivers. If you are a caregiver, know that you are not alone - 29 percent of all inquiries to Information Specialists were from caregivers and more than 1,800 caregivers are on LLS Community to connect, share experiences and provide support, along with trained LLS staff. Whether you join a live, weekly online chat moderated by an oncology social worker, participate in an LLS Family Support Group in your community, or tune in to The Bloodline with LLS podcast, you can find the support that is right for you. SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l EDUCATION & SUPPORTANNUAL REPORT 2018 41SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l POLICY & ADVOCACY POLICY & ADVOCACY Through our nationwide grassroots network of more than 100,000 volunteers, we advocate for policies at the state and federal level that accelerate new treatments and ensure patients have access to care, so that they can live longer, healthier lives. This year, our efforts have helped to increase federal cancer research funds, speed the review and approval process for new therapies, and protect patient access to lifesaving treatments. ANNUAL REPORT 2018 42While advances in blood cancer therapies are having a dramatic impact on the way patients are treated, critical challenges remain. At LLS, we work tirelessly to find cures, as well as to ensure patients have access to the lifesaving treatments they need. With more than 100,000 volunteer advocates across the country, we are making our voices heard on behalf of the 1.3 million blood cancer patients and survivors whom we serve. What's more, many of the policies for which we advocate at the state and federal level are beneficial for all cancer patients. WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD CURES LLS works with Congress, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other federal agencies to promote new medical discoveries and speed the development of new treatments and cures. This year, key highlights of our work included : Achieving a major win for dedicated pediatric cancer research LLS advocates sent more than 3,100 letters to members of Congress, raising their voices to make The Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research (STAR) Act a reality - the most comprehensive childhood cancer legislation ever introduced. After Congress unanimously passed this bill, the President signed the Childhood Cancer STAR Act into law in June. LLS actively supported this legislation, which will expand opportunities for childhood cancer research and survivorship programs and make a powerful impact on the lives of childhood cancer patients, survivors and their families. Securing new funding for cancer research LLS advocates sent more than 2,400 letters asking Congress to increase funding for critical cancer research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Thanks to this and other patient advocate groups' efforts, Congress allocated $3 billion in new research funding, which will improve cancer patients' lives and bring us that much closer to cures. Further, recognizing the importance of the Defense Department's innovative cancer research program, LLS took the lead in asking Congress to make blood cancer research a priority within this program. Congress listened to our request, increasing funding for this cancer research program by $20 million\u2014a 33 percent increase from last year\u2014while also restoring \"blood cancers\" as a priority research focus in 2018. Supporting patient-focused drug development We continue to be a strong voice for cancer patients at the FDA, shining a light on the urgent realities they face. As cancer treatment becomes more personalized, understanding which elements of a potential treatment are most important to patients is vital. We presented the results of our National Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Patient Preference Study to leadership at the FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE) to help inform the efforts of the FDA, pharmaceutical and biotech companies, and academic researchers to understand what really matters to patients as they pursue crucial drug development for AML.SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l POLICY & ADVOCACYMark was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia when he was just two months old. As an infant, he endured intense treatment through a clinical trial and countless trips to the intensive care unit. Today, Mark is a healthy college student who is passionate about giving back and exceling at West Chester University of Pennsylvania. He openly shares his story, and visits young patients and their families in the hospital. Both Mark and his mother Jayne also volunteer with LLS through the Eastern Pennsylvania Chapter. In 2015, Mark won the coveted Student of the Year title at the chapter after raising $62,000 for LLS in seven weeks. Most recently, in April 2018, Mark and Jayne attended the Alliance for Childhood Cancer Action Days in Washington D.C. to share the patient and caregiver perspective and advocate for important pediatric cancer issues before Congress, including the Childhood Cancer STAR Act. As a member of the Alliance for Childhood Cancer, LLS worked with Congress and community partners to advance this legislation - which was signed into law in May. The law will boost pediatric cancer research efforts, unlock new insights into childhood cancer through enhanced tracking and reporting and improve the quality of life for childhood cancer survivors like Mark.MARK A childhood cancer survivor becomes a powerful voice for patients and families ANNUAL REPORT 2018 43SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l POLICY & ADVOCACYANNUAL REPORT 2018 44LLS ADVOCATES TOOK ACTION While legislators debated proposals that would roll back access to meaningful health insurance coverage, LLS advocated strongly at the state and federal level for guaranteed access to stable, quality, affordable coverage. LLS advocates took action by contacting federal and state policymakers: 11,000MORE THAN ADVOCATE LETTERS SENT 1,100MORE THAN CALLS WERE MADE 65+CONDUCTED IN-PERSON MEETINGS WITH POLICYMAKERS WE ARE PROTECTING PATIENTS' ABILITY TO ACCESS THE TREATMENTS AND CARE THEY NEED Cancer patients must have access to meaningful health insurance coverage. Their lives literally depend on it. To this end, LLS advances solutions that uphold our core principles for meaningful coverage: guarantee access, promote affordability, ensure quality and encourage stability. This year, Congress and state policymakers debated proposals that would roll back access to meaningful health insurance coverage, including for low-income children and families enrolled in Medicaid. Throughout those debates, LLS advocated strongly at the state and federal level for guaranteed access to stable, quality, affordable coverage for the hundreds of thousands of blood cancer patients who would be impacted by these proposals.SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l POLICY & ADVOCACYANNUAL REPORT 2018 45ENSURING QUALITY INSURANCE COVERAGE At LLS, we believe health insurance plans should meet minimum quality standards so that patients will have access to the care they need. Unfortunately, many plans fail to meet those standards. Consider Sam's story. A small business owner, Sam attempted to upgrade his health insurance after seeing a chiropractor for undiagnosed back pain. He wanted to be able to better cover any potential medical care he might need. A few months later, he was diagnosed with cancer and immediately began treatment. Six months into treatment, his plan refused to cover any of these medical costs, saying that his cancer was a pre-existing condition. Sam was left to battle cancer with no meaningful insurance coverage and more than $800,000 in medical debt. As the federal government worked to finalize rules expanding the availability of the very type of plan Sam held - plans that lack many critical protections required by the Affordable Care Act - LLS pushed back through a multifaceted effort. On this issue alone, we generated 3,202 grassroots letters to Congress and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). We also urged governors, state legislators and insurance commissioners to take action to protect patients from the impact of these junk plans. By engaging our partners and working with LLS advocates to share their stories, LLS helped bring a bill to the governor's desk in Illinois to constrain these types of plans, establishing an important model for other states. \"I was diagnosed with stage IV non-Hodgkin lymphoma and was unaware that I had purchased a limited policy. I was left with $800,000 in medical bills and no meaningful health insurance to pay for a potentially lifesaving transplant.\" SAM, CANCER SURVIVOR AND LLS ADVOCATESECTION 2: OUR MISSION l POLICY & ADVOCACYANNUAL REPORT 2018 46PLAYING A LEADING ROLE IN ADDRESSING THE RISING COST OF CANCER CARE FOR PATIENTS The rising cost of cancer care has reached a boiling point. In fact, about one-third of inquiries to LLS's Information Specialists were from patients with financial issues and questions. We believe every player in the healthcare system needs to take steps to address this dilemma by putting patients at the forefront. In 2018, we did just that by continuing to advocate for policy reforms that could help lower overall costs and relieve patients' financial distress. Over the past year, a number of such reforms have been implemented or are under serious consideration. For example, the FDA has sped up the review of generic drug applications, providing potentially less costly alternatives for patients. In addition, a new law passed in February will prevent Medicare Part D patients from paying more when they switch from an expensive branded biologic drug to a cheaper \"biosimilar\" version - a change that saves money for patients and taxpayers. LLS worked with other advocacy organizations and stakeholders to support these and other changes, many of which were outlined in our 2017 recommendations to help reduce the cost of cancer care. While progress has been made, much work remains ahead to remove barriers to care for patients. WORKING TO GUARANTEE ACCESS TO CARE This year, state policymakers proposed unprecedented changes to Medicaid that would require Medicaid recipients to prove that they're employed in order to receive coverage for their medical care. LLS IS TAKING A BOLD STAND FOR PATIENTS AGAINST THE RISING COST OF CANCER CARE. > VIEW OUR 2018 PROGRESS REPORT.SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l POLICY & ADVOCACY It's estimated that these proposals will result in thousands of low-income patients losing their only source of affordable healthcare. For that reason, LLS stood united with other patient advocates in opposition to these proposals in 13 states this year. LLS took steps not only to defend access to Medicaid coverage, but we also joined forces with advocates in three states to expand eligibility for Medicaid. LLS believes strongly that all blood cancer patients should have access to affordable coverage for the treatment they need.Sharon was diagnosed with myeloma in 2015. Her treatment included multiple courses of oral anti-cancer medication, countless injections, infusions, hospitalizations, a stem cell transplant and two spinal surgeries to repair cracked bones. She continues to be treated with oral anti-cancer therapy just to keep her cancer in remission. A one-month prescription with partial coverage costs her $2,000 out of pocket for the first several months of every year. At one point, Sharon had to stop taking her medications for two consecutive months because she simply did not have the money. As an LLS advocate, she has courageously shared her story with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and members of Congress. Sharon encourages anyone going through a cancer diagnosis to get involved with opportunities to tell their story. \"Being able to share my story so that I can help and inspire others has been the most fulfilling and therapeutic treatment,\" she says.SHARON LLS Advocate courageously shares her story\u2014and inspires others to do the same ANNUAL REPORT 2018 47SECTION 2: OUR MISSION l POLICY & ADVOCACYVOLUNTEERS IMPACT OUR MISSION Our volunteers are part of a diverse community of supporters who represent all walks of life and bring different experiences and passions to drive forward our mission.

ANNUAL REPORT 2018 49SECTION 4 ANNUAL REPORT 2018 50Through our signature fundraising campaigns, participants help us support lifesaving research, patient and healthcare provider support and education, and advocacy efforts that benefit blood cancer patients. LLS has been a pioneer in creating unique and innovative peer-to-peer fundraising campaigns, including: TEAM IN TRAINING Fundraising Teammates celebrated at over 25 epic endurance events annually For over 30 years, the Team In Training campaign has supported LLS as their premier charity endurance training program\u2014where teammates raise funds to help change the lives of those impacted by blood cancers. This campaign continues to deliver a transformative experience that inspires and supports teammates through camaraderie, coaching and an engaging journey of personal discovery. Team In Training teammates complete events in Run/Walk, Cycle, Tri, and Hike. Teammates have also started fundraising through new cycling and climbing experiences with numerous fundraisers summiting Mount Kilimanjaro, journeying to Everest Basecamp and cycling over some of Europe's historic mountains, all while raising money and awareness for LLS. The campaign has raised more than $1.5 billion and trained more than 650,000 teammates since 1988. In FY18, the campaign significantly exceeded its revenue goals, indicating that strategic rebranding efforts are paying off and delivering results for our mission.

(LLS), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2018, and the related consolidated statements of activities, functional expenses, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that The Board of Directors The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc.: November 7, 2018we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the organization's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the organization's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. as of June 30, 2018, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Report on Summarized Comparative Information We have previously audited LLS's 2017 consolidated financial statements, and we expressed an unmodified audit opinion on those audited consolidated financial statements in our report dated October 27, 2017. In our opinion, the summarized comparative information presented herein as of and for the year ended June 30, 2017 is consistent, in all material respects, with the audited consolidated financial statements from which it has been derived.SECTION 6: FINANCIALSANNUAL REPORT 2018 564 THE LEUKEMIA & LYMPHOMA SOCIETY Consolidated Balance Sheet The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. / June 30, 2018 (with comparative amounts at June 30, 2017) (In thousands)THE LEUKEMIA & LYMPHOMA SOCIETY, INC.

(LLS) is the world's largest voluntary health agency dedicated to finding cures for blood cancers and providing services to blood cancer patients, their families, and caregivers. LLS's mission is to cure leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and myeloma and improve the quality of life of patients and their families. LLS research grants have funded many of today's most promising advances for the treatment of blood cancer patients, including targeted therapies and immunotherapies. LLS is a leading source of publicly available information regarding blood cancer and education and support programs. LLS influences public policies that accelerate the development and approval of new blood cancer therapies and advocates for all blood cancer patients and their families, helping patients navigate their cancer treatments and access to quality, affordable and coordinated care. LLS is dedicated to removing barriers to care by representing the healthcare and medical research interests of patients and families to policy makers at all levels of government. b) Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of LLS that encompass the National Office of LLS and its fifty six chapters in the United States, and LLS's not for profit affiliates, including The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of Canada, Inc. (LLSC) and its five chapters in Canada, The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Research Programs, Inc. (LLSRP), The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Research Foundation (LLSRF), and PearlPoint Cancer Support, Inc. (PPCS). Effective March 28, 2016, LLS became the sole member of PPCS. As part of the assumption of control, LLS recognized a transfer of net assets of $552 in 2016. Effective February 8, 2018, PPCS was dissolved. All significant intercompany and intra LLS accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. c) Tax-Exempt Status LLS, LLSRP, LLSRF, and PPCS qualify as charitable organizations as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) and, accordingly, are exempt from federal income taxes under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(a). Additionally, as these organizations are publicly supported, contributions qualify for the maximum charitable contri- bution deduction under the Internal Revenue Code. LLSC is registered as a charitable organization under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and is, therefore, not subject to income taxes if certain disbursement requirements are met. LLS and its related entities recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained. Income generated from activities unrelated to exempt purposes are subject to tax under Internal Revenue Code Section 511. There were no entities that recognized any unrelated business income tax liability for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. d) Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires LLS's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The significant estimates made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements include the fair value of alternative investments, allowance for uncol- lectible accounts, allocation of functional expenses, and valuation of donated services, goods and media. Actual results could differ from those estimates.The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. / June 30, 2018 (In thousands) (continues \u00bb)SECTION 6: FINANCIALSANNUAL REPORT 2018 612018 FINANCIALS 9 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. / June 30, 2018 (In thousands) e) Risks and Uncertainties LLS invests in various investment securities. Investment securities are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate risks, market risk, political risks, and credit risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet. LLS's principal source of revenue is contributions by the general public. Accordingly, LLS's operations are depen- dent upon individual contributions that are affected by general economic conditions, employment levels, and other factors over which LLS has little or no control. By contrast to the granularity of the general public donations, the Co Pay program in 2018 and 2017 was funded by six and eight donors, respectively. In addition, the Beat AML Master Trial was primarily funded by seven and five donors in 2018 and 2017, respectively. f) Summarized Financial Information The consolidated financial statements are presented with 2017 summarized for comparative information. With respect to the consolidated statement of activities, such prior year information is not presented by net asset class and, in the consolidated statement of functional expenses, 2017 expenses by natural classification are presented in total rather than by functional category. Accordingly, such information should be read in conjunction with LLS's 2017 consolidated financial statements from which the summarized information was derived. g) Subsequent Events LLS evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date of June 30, 2018 through November 7, 2018, which was the date the consolidated financial statements were issued, and concluded that no additional disclosures are required. h) Net Asset Classifications To ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed on the use of resources available to LLS, funds that have similar characteristics have been classified into three net asset categories as follows: Unrestricted net assets: Consist of funds that are fully available, at the discretion of LLS's Board of Directors, for LLS to utilize for its programs or supporting services. Temporarily restricted net assets: Consist of funds that are restricted by donors for a specific time period and/or purpose. Permanently restricted net assets: Consist of funds that contain donor imposed restrictions requiring that the principal be invested in perpetuity. Income earned on these funds is recorded as temporarily restricted net assets and is released from restriction when the donor stipulated purpose has been fulfilled and/or the amount has been appropriated in compliance with the Board approved spending policy (note 5). i) Foreign Currency Translation LLSC uses the Canadian dollar as its functional currency. Accordingly, the currency translation of the finan- cial statements of LLSC to U.S. dollars is included as a translation adjustment in the consolidated statement of activities. j) Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted or published prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that a reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. (continues \u00bb)SECTION 6: FINANCIALSANNUAL REPORT 2018 6210 THE LEUKEMIA & LYMPHOMA SOCIETY Level 2 inputs other than quoted or published prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. LLS follows the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, for its alternative investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, including hedge funds, limited partner- ships, and other funds. This guidance allows, as a practical expedient, for the estimation of the fair value of invest- ments in investment companies for which the investment does not have a readily determinable fair value, using net asset value (NAV) per share or its equivalent, as reported by the investment managers. The classification of investments in the fair value hierarchy is not necessarily an indication of the risks, liquidity, or degree of difficulty in estimating the fair value of each investment's underlying assets and liabilities. k) Contributions, Grants and Deferred Revenue Contributions are recorded as revenue, at fair value, when received or promised unconditionally. Contributions received with donor restrictions that limit their use are reported as either temporarily or permanently restricted revenue. When a donor restriction is met through the passage of time or fulfillment of a purpose restriction, tem- porarily restricted net assets are reclassified to unrestricted net assets and reported in the consolidated statement of activities as net assets released from restrictions. Conditional contributions are recognized as revenue when the conditions have been substantially met. Certain grants are accounted for as exchange transactions whereby revenue is recognized when the related expenses are incurred. Amounts received under these arrangements but not yet expended are reported as deferred revenue. l) Service Revenue Service revenue is accounted for as an exchange transaction whereby revenue is recognized when the related expenses are incurred. Amounts received under these arrangements but not yet expended are reported as deferred revenue. m) Donated Services and Goods LLS has determined that certain of the donated services and goods it receives meet the criteria for recognition in the consolidated financial statements. The value of contributed goods was determined based on fair market value estimates. The value of contributed services was determined for volunteers that possess specialized skills and would otherwise need to be purchased. These goods and services are recognized as revenue and expense (note 8). n) Donated Media LLS has conducted national public service announcements (PSA) media campaigns and benefited from donated media time that was aired on television and radio. The value of contributed media, which is recognized in the consolidated financial statements, was estimated based on the placement, audience, and demographics of the PSAs (note 8). o) Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of short term investments with an original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase, except for amounts held in investments. p) Investments Investments are stated at fair value based upon quoted or published market prices, except for the fair values of alternative investments, which are based on NAVs provided by the fund managers or general partners, based upon the underlying net assets of the funds consistent with the concepts of ASC Topic 820. These values are reviewed and evaluated by management.

The significant requirements of the new ASU include the reduction of the number of net asset classes from three to two: with donor restrictions and without donor restrictions; the pre- sentation of expenses by their function and their natural classification in one location; quantitative and qualitative information about the management of liquid resources and availability of financial assets to meet cash needs within one year of the date of the Consolidated Balance Sheet; and retaining the option to present operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows using either the direct or indirect method. LLS plans to adopt ASU 2016 14 for the year ending June 30, 2019. The FASB is issuing Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018 08, to clarify and improve the scope and the accounting guidance for contributions received and contributions made. The amendments in this Update should assist entities in (1) evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as contributions (nonreciprocal transactions) within the scope of Topic 958, Not for Profit Entities, or as exchange (reciprocal) transactions subject to other guidance and (2) determining whether a contribution is conditional. LLS plans to adopt ASU 2018 08 for the year ending June 30, 2020. LLS is continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting this guidance on its financial statements. 2) Research LLS has various activities that are utilized to carry out its mission as presented below: Research Awards and Grants: Awards and grants for research are approved by LLS's Board of Directors and are recognized as expense when contractual conditions have been satisfied. The budgets for multiyear grants, which are generally two to five years in length, are approved on an annual basis and may be terminated at the discretion of LLS's Board of Directors. LLS has multiyear grant commitments of $52,216 at June 30, 2018, that are conditioned upon future events and, accordingly, are not recorded. LLS has unconditional grants payable of $51,673 and $64,052 at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which are anticipated to be paid in the next year. Grant refunds of approximately $984 and $923 as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, have been netted against awards and grants expense. TAP: Therapy Acceleration Program (TAP) is LLS's strategic initiative to speed the development of blood cancer treatments and supportive diagnostics by creating business alliances with biotechnology, pharmaceutical companies, and universities. TAP provides funding for investigational new drug enabling studies and clinical stage projects. TAP contracts are recognized as an expense in the year program milestones are achieved. Multiyear contracts, which are (continues \u00bb)Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. / June 30, 2018 (Amounts in thousands)SECTION 6: FINANCIALSANNUAL REPORT 2018 6412 THE LEUKEMIA & LYMPHOMA SOCIETY generally two to three years in length, are reviewed against milestones on a quarterly basis and may be terminated at the discretion of LLS. LLS has contract commitments of $12,745 and $9,144 at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, that are conditioned upon future events and, accordingly, are not recorded. Grant refunds of approximately $591 as of June 30, 2018 have been netted against therapy acceleration program contractual return. Commitments for the awards and grants and TAP programs are contingent upon the satisfactory completion of mile- stones and/or other conditions in the grant and contract agreements. If such conditions are satisfied, the amounts are estimated to be paid as follows: Year ending June 30: 2019 $ 2022 2,569 TAP Contractual Return: In January 2009, as part of its TAP, LLS entered into an agreement with Celator Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Celator) through which LLS provided funding of approximately $4,100 to Celator in support of the Phase 2 study of Celator's lead compound Vyxeos (daunorubicin and cytarabine liposome for injection) for the treat- ment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). From 2012 through 2016, LLS provided funding of an additional $5,000 for the Phase 3 clinical study of Vyxeos. LLS provisions of funding to Celator were based on clinical milestones. As part of the agreement, Celator was obligated to make payments to LLS relative to the timing of the product com- mercialization and other liquidity events. In July 2016, Jazz Pharmaceuticals (Jazz) completed the purchase of Celator, triggering a payment of $13,716 to LLS. In late 2016, Jazz terminated the agreement with LLS triggering a one time contract termination fee of $11,612 to eliminate potential future royalty payments related to Vyxeos. The total amount of the return to LLS from its TAP contract in Celator was $25,328. The remaining $4,220 of TAP contractual return for the year ended June 30, 2017 comes from various other TAP contracts. For the year ended June 30, 2018, LLS received $3,855 of TAP contractual returns from various TAP contracts. 3) Co-Pay Assistance Program Co-Pay Assistance Program: The Co Pay Assistance program offers financial assistance to patients in meeting their insurance Co Pay obligations for prescription medications or private/public health insurance premiums. Revenue is recognized when donations are received while expenses are recognized as patient applications are approved for participation according to program criteria and on availability of funding. The Co Pay Assistance payable of $54,696 and $20,071 has been established based on approved patient applications received through June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At June 30, 2018, temporarily restricted net assets include $52,528 received in 2018, which are available for expenditure and are intended to be awarded in fiscal year 2019. The following summarizes the activities of the Co-Pay Assistance program in 2018 and 2017. Beginning balance $ 8,148 8,960 Co-Pay contributions 159,851 77,779 Amount expended during the year: Direct assistance to patients (108,442) (72,969) Other expenses incurred and reimbursed under the contract (7,355) (5,622) Amounts available for expenditures in the next year $ 52,528 8,1482018 2017 Investments gains 326__ (continues \u00bb)Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. / June 30, 2018 (Amounts in thousands)SECTION 6: FINANCIALSANNUAL REPORT 2018 652018 FINANCIALS 13 4) Investments The following tables present LLS's fair value hierarchy of investments measured at fair value on an annual basis as of June 30, 2018 and 2017: Money market funds and cash Fixed income: Corporate bonds Government securities and other Equities: Large cap equity International equity Small/mid cap equity Commodities Investments reported at net asset value: Multi strategy hedge funds Total investments reported at net asset valueLevel 1 158,371 56,758 849 35,644 33,437 funds and cash Fixed income: Corporate bonds Government securities and other Equities: Large cap equity International equity Small/mid cap 201,561 \u2014\u20142017 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Investments reported at net asset value: Multi strategy hedge funds 7,860 Total investments reported at net asset value 7,860 $ 209,421 (continues \u00bb)Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. / June 30, 2018 (Amounts in thousands)SECTION 6: FINANCIALSANNUAL REPORT 2018 6614 THE LEUKEMIA & LYMPHOMA SOCIETY Investment expenses totaled $318 and $376 for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The unrealized gains were $1,802 and $4,504 for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. LLS's alternative investments strategy is as follows: Multi strategy hedge funds - represent investments in a broad range of investment strategies that seek to exploit opportunities as they occur in the markets due to temporary dislocations or structural inefficiencies and include event driven strategies, distressed debt, merger and other arbitrage, and value investing. The strategy creates indirect exposure to LLS through short sales of securities, trading in future and forward contracts, and other derivative products. Derivatives are investment contracts used to hedge risk. While these financial instru- ments may contain varying degrees of risk, LLS's risk with respect to such transactions is limited to its capital balance in each investment. LLS's alternative investments contain various redemption restrictions with required written notice ranging from 45-95 days. By contrast, all of LLS's nonalternative investments are highly liquid and can be redeemed daily without restric- tion. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the following table summarizes the redemption provisions for those investments reported at NAV: 2018 2017 Redemption period: Quarterly 1,595 Total $ 8,066 7,860June 30 As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, LLS had no unfunded commitments on its alternative investments. 5) Temporarily and Permanently Restricted Net Assets Temporarily restricted net assets and the income earned on permanently restricted net assets are available for the following purposes at June 30, 2018 and 2017: 2018 2017 Temporarily Permanently Temporarily Permanently restricted restricted restricted restricted Time restrictions $ 13,702 \u2014 6,297 \u2014 Research 13,209 3,100 7,097 7,533 \u2014 Co-Pay assistance 52,528 \u2014 8,148 \u2014 Other 757 52 86 121 Total $ 90,221 3,152 29,161 3,156 LLS follows the provisions of the New York Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act, which imposes guidelines on the management and investment of endowment funds. LLS has interpreted the relevant law as allowing LLS to appropriate for expenditure or accumulate so much of an endowment fund as LLS determines is prudent considering the uses, benefits, purposes, and duration for which the endowment fund is established, subject to the intent of the donor as expressed in the gift instrument.

The spending rate policy at June 30, 2018 and 2017 was 4% of ending balance at June 30, plus any additional amounts advised by donors. Under this policy, the endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce results consistent with LLS's overall investment strategy.
