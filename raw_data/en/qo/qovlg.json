Intuitive Energy Healing for Couples Our intimate relationships are our biggest teachers, but over time the mundane to-do lists of life can lead to a decreased connection as a couple, a mutual lack of attention, and a growing loss of intimacy. This session is designed to clear each individual's energy as well as the collective energy between you as a couple. By creating a safe space of union and connection, you can strive to combine forces and create a clear path forward. Each couples' session includes Aromatherapy, Guided Meditation, and Reiki energy work to enhance your connection, balance your chakras, remove cords or attachments, and cleanse your emotional and physical body. After your session, we invite you to reflect on your shared experience and further strengthen your sense of connection by spending some integration time in the KC Wellness Club Steam Bath and/or Sauna. 90 min Couples Session with one provider | $240 (allow for 2 hours total time) Side-By-Side Couples Energy Healing and Massage Our Energy Healer and Massage Therapist have partnered up to create this one-of-a-kind package for couples.
