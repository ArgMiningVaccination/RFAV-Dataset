We continue to develop our plans in partnership with Tufts Medical Center, along with guidance from state and local authorities. Berklee's Health and Wellness team, in collaboration with campus leadership, will continue to closely monitor COVID-19 data and trends. Any necessary adjustments or temporary reinstatements of protocols will be communicated promptly to the Berklee community. Please note that this information is subject to change. Health and Safety Protocols Our current policies, updated May 11, 2023, align with the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Massachusetts Department of Health recommendations. Covid Vaccinations Berklee no longer requires Covid vaccinations for students, faculty, and staff, though we strongly recommend staying up to date with the [CDC's COVID-19 vaccination recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) and [getting vaccinated](https://www.mass.gov/covid-19-vaccine) to protect yourself and others. Covid vaccinations have been shown to be highly effective in preventing serious illness. Students: Please continue to [submit proof of vaccination](/immunization-requirements) through [Magnus Health](https://www.berklee.edu/immunization-requirements) so our records are up to date. Testing Program For symptomatic testing, visit your personal healthcare provider or seek care through our partners at [Tufts Medical Center](https://www.berklee.edu/health/care-near-campus). Take-home tests can also be obtained from major pharmacies. Reporting Covid-Positive Cases You are not required to report positive Covid cases, though you should continue to notify all close contacts of their potential exposure. We urge anyone who tests positive to follow the CDC's isolation guidelines diligently. Your health and the safety of our community remain our utmost priority. Masking Masks are optional on Berklee's Boston campus, aligning with the current guidance from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. If you choose to wear a mask, we recommend the use of high-quality masks, such as N95s, KN95s, KF94s, and FFP3/2s, which provide optimal coverage and secure fit, reducing the risk of viral transmission. Additionally, we encourage the use of masks inside your home if you or others are feeling unwell or have underlying medical conditions that increase the risk of severe COVID-19. Quarantine and Isolation Berklee requires that community members who test positive for COVID-19 self-isolate for a period of five days regardless of previous infection, vaccination or booster status, and the presence or absence of symptoms. Please follow current [CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html). Event and Performance Policies There are no vaccination, testing, or masking requirements for event attendees. [Learn more](/btb/public-events-and-performances).

Learn about how to access [medical care for students](https://www.berklee.edu/health/care-near-campus), including telehealth, through Tufts Medical Center.

State and Greater Boston Area Health Guidelines The Boston Public Health Commission has comprehensive information on the [city of Boston COVID-19 website](https://www.boston.gov/government/cabinets/boston-public-health-commission/covid-19-boston) about efforts to minimize the spread of COVID-19.

Accommodations Students If you are at an increased risk of severe illness if you contract COVID-19, contact your physician to assess the risks of living and/or studying on campus. For more information, or to request accommodations, please contact [accessibilityresources@berklee.edu](mailto:accessibilityresources@berklee.edu). Faculty and Staff If a faculty or staff member is experiencing a health condition that limits their ability to perform essential functions of their role, they may seek a temporary workplace accommodation through Human Resources. Please follow Berklee's [reasonable accommodation process](https://www.berklee.edu/introduction-table-contents/overview/106-accommodations-workplace). If an employee voluntarily discloses any medical information, it will be handled with the highest degree of sensitivity and confidentiality. Various options that support a healthy and safe work environment will be considered.
