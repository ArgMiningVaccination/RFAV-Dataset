In reality, for most vaccines - which replace old vaccines - that would be unethical. \"I've discussed clinical equipoise before, but before I define it, let me use an example to illustrate it. Let's say we have a new chemotherapy drug for breast cancer that we want to test in a clinical trial. If you were to accept Mr. Siri's intentionally simplistic view of RCTs, you would think that any RCT testing this new drug must be designed with a placebo control group that receives only saline placebo. You would be so very, very incredibly wrong. The reason is that such a trial would totally unethical, for the simple reason that you would be leaving cancer patients in the control group untreated and it is completely unethical to randomize subjects to a group that will deny them existing effective treatment and thus cause them harm and even death. ... [usual] design means that the placebo group still receives at least the existing standard-of-care treatment for their cancer and is not intentionally left untreated\u2014or even just undertreated. .... That brings us to vaccines. The only time that a placebo-controlled RCT of a vaccine can be ethically justified is when there currently does not exist a safe and effective vaccine against the disease for which the experimental vaccine has been designed. ... Now look at Mr. Siri's list above that's been going around social media. Do you notice anything? Almost none of the vaccines on the list that weren't licensed based on RCTs using saline controls are not first generation vaccines, which means that it would have been unethical to test them against a saline control. So they were tested against some other comparator, usually an earlier licensed version of a vaccine against the same disease, for example DTaP vaccines being tested against the older DTP vaccines, flu vaccines like Fluvaria being tested against older flu vaccines like Fluarix or Fluzone, or Hiberix being tested against older vaccines against Hib like ActHIB. The bottom line is that, if you trace back the history of the vaccines developed for a disease like, say, measles, you will eventually find the RCT testing the first effective vaccine against it and that vaccine will have had a placebo control. It might not have been saline (although in most cases decades ago it was), but it will have been a placebo that is \"inert\" with respect to preventing that disease. Also, clinical trial standards have evolved over the last 70 years. If a vaccine was approved 60+ years ago using methodology that today we would consider inadequate, that does not change the calculous when it comes to testing new vaccines against the same disease. Such vaccines can't ethically be [Dorit Reiss](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dorit-reiss-2442a79?trk=public_post_comment-text): Great post and quite insightful. Sadly, the conspiracy theorists paint such tales that get the average (undereducated) excited and totally blind to the truth. Thank you for taking the time to share. "}
