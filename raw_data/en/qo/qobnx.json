It's most celebrated for its ability to brighten skin, evening tone and helping to minimize discoloration, hyperpigmentation, age spots, and residual scarring from acne or injury. Fuller's earth is naturally cooling, bringing relief to inflammation and painful conditions. It is also excellent at balancing sebum secretions, reducing excess oil and stagnation in the skin that contributes to acne.

I believe in cacao as more than just a special sweet treat or even as an ingredient to lend a hunger-inducing aroma to all but one formula in our core facial collection. Exceptionally high in antioxidants, raw cacao blocks free radicals, protecting skin against damage to collagen and elastin while promoting and renewing skin cell tissue. Cacao contains omega 6 fatty acids and raw enzymes, both of which help in cellular repair and rejuvenation. Topical use increases blood flow to the skin, reducing inflammation and redness, slowing the visible aging process, and supporting healthy moisture content. Sourcing Nearly all of the cacao on the planet is produced for consumption in the massive food and fragrance industries, where the priority is strictly to maximize aromas and flavors with aggressive toasting processes. Unfortunately, the excessive heat used to achieve the characteristic chocolate scent you are accustomed to greatly diminishes the nutritional value of this precious food ingredient. It was an uphill battle to find producers who are instead dedicated to the gentle extraction and distillation of aromatic raw materials that preserve and honor the bean's high antioxidant content. I am committed to ever-increasing my quality standard, taking every challenge as an opportunity to dig deeper into our core values. After years searching the world, testing cacao samples from a zillion vendors, navigating ingredient adulteration and dilution and the underbelly of labeling loopholes that plague our industry, I can say without hesitation we have earned access to the best of the best with each form of cacao we incorporate into our treats. From our rich and succulent cacao butter to our exclusive, freshly-made raw oleoresin, to our nutrient-dense powdered bean, our cacao is a point of pride and total joy. Fair Trade Historically, cacao has been and still is a significant source of tropical deforestation. At the same time, it is a crop on which many conservationists and natural resource managers base their hopes for an agriculture industry that not only provides a livelihood for tropical farmers but also helps to conserve biodiversity in the tropical landscape. Growing cacao under a canopy enhances the soil, protects it from erosion, provides non-cacao products to the farmer and a refuge for an array of animal groups like birds, insects, small mammals, and reptiles. The leaf litter provided by a shade canopy is particularly important for the life cycle of the insects that pollinate the cacao blossoms. Farmers that choose to grow cacao using sustainable methods rely on organic or premium markets for the higher prices they must charge for making a commitment to increasing biodiversity and embracing environmentally-friendly agriculture. Although chocolate is a huge ($70+ billion annually) global business, only about 6-8 percent of this revenue makes its way back to the cocoa farmers, many of whom run small family operations. Labor abuse is rife in many cocoa regions, and reports of farmers enslaving thousands of child workers have sparked widespread criticism of the industry. Labor and environmental issues have inspired the formation of several organizations and associations of wholesalers, retailers, and producers whose members are committed to growing cacao sustainably, providing fair wages and opportunities to economically disadvantaged artisans and farmers worldwide. We are committed to supporting this vital effort by choosing makers that produce organically and ethically under Fair Trade guidelines. \"Chocolate is the answer. Who cares what the question is.\" \u2014Everyone, Everywhere Clay Our red rhassoul is a truly exquisite, therapeutic quality clay from ancient deposits unearthed from the fertile Atlas Mountains in Morocco. It is sun-dried and untreated and contains high percentages of silica and magnesium. Rhassoul clay boasts a high negative charge that enables it to draw out blackheads, congestion, and other impurities from skin with ease without disrupting your natural oil balance. This is the ultimate spa clay and achieves results like none other.

It has been used in Chinese medicine practices and Ayurveda for thousands of years. Cinnamon's strong antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects, coupled with its high antioxidant content, make this aromatic star a powerful addition to our formulas. Our skin is exposed to oxidative stress and damage from free radicals on a daily basis. Cinnamon has the unique ability to increase blood circulation and collagen production through a key ingredient known as 'cinnamaldehyde.' This (naturally occurring) chemical constituent boosts circulation and assists in plumping skin and fighting the common effects of visible aging and cell damage. Although there are about 250 species of cinnamomum recognized today, the cinnamomum cassia (cassia cinnamon) from China is the most common commercial variety and what you are most likely to find in nearly all grocers, natural food stores, prepared food and beauty products. However, cassia cinnamon is not true cinnamon and does not deliver the same benefits as the Ceylon variety, grown mostly in Sri Lanka. The distinction between these two types is vital. Cassia cinnamon is an irritant and does not contain the beneficial medicinal and beautifying properties of true Ceylon cinnamon. Sourcing note: Sri Lankan cinnamon is regarded as the highest grade on the global market. 80% of the cinnamon cultivation in Sri Lanka is attributed to small farmers. Dedicated to environmentally-friendly agricultural practices, this ingredient is part of our Ethical Global Sourcing Program. Our organic Ceylon cinnamon powder is shipped to our kitchen directly from a small organic farming cooperative, ensuring unparalleled freshness and quality for our clients and enhancing the living standards of the small farmers and communities in the project areas. At present, the association consists of 52 branch societies with more than 2,600 farmers. As a fundamental concept of organic agriculture, members practice mixed cropping systems and use a natural approach to pest control through companion-planting of shade trees, bug repellent plants, and medicinal herbs. Our vision is to support environmentally-friendly agriculture along with equally treated and economically empowered farmers and their communities.

Once exclusively grown on the Spice Islands of Indonesia, nutmeg was considered to be more valuable than gold until the monopoly was broken by the French, who smuggled seedling trees to plant in Mauritius in the 18th century. This sweet, fragrant, and nutty spice is an appreciated staple today in the cuisines of India, Indonesia, the Middle East, and even Japan. Apart from its culinary use, nutmeg has been valued for centuries for its healing benefits. In the Elizabethan era, it was even thought to ward off the plague! With its significantly high antioxidant content and antimicrobial and antibacterial compounds, nutmeg has the incredible power to fight off harmful pathogens and free radicals. It boasts the unique ability to relieve and soothe the skin, reducing inflammation and the resulting fine lines, scars, and wrinkles. Natural healers use nutmeg to brighten the complexion, heal acne, and reduce facial discoloration and hyperpigmentation. Sourcing note: Dedicated to environmentally friendly agricultural practices, this ingredient has been added to our Ethical Global Sourcing Program. Our nutmeg powder gets shipped directly from a small organic farming cooperative in Sri Lanka to our studio in Los Angeles, ensuring freshness for our clients and enhancing the living standards of the small farmers and communities in the project areas.

Red alaea salt, which derives its Hawaiian name from the red alaea volcanic clay, is truly one of a kind for many reasons. Its mesmerizing deep red color, uniquely rich mineral content, powerful medicinal benefits, and delicate taste make red alaea salt a must in both kitchens and bathrooms. It was originally used by Hawaiians in ceremony to bless and purify anything from canoes to temples and is still treasured and used in healing rituals today. This special salt is created through the natural evaporation process that occurs while water is trapped in tidal pools and mixes with red volcanic clay. This allows the salt to absorb the clay's abundant variety of minerals, vitamins, and electrolytes, transforming it into a nutrient powerhouse. When applied topically, red alaea salt acts as a natural detoxifier, increasing circulation, absorbing toxins, and simultaneously exfoliating dead skin cells. Additionally, the numerous skin nourishing nutrients from both the ocean salt and red clay are absorbed through the skin to result in a smooth, regenerated, healthy complexion. When you swim in the ocean, enjoy a salt bath, or indulge in salt as an ingredient in skin treatments, it effectively reduces fluid retention, purifying the body, relaxing tissue, and is also said to cleanse negative energy and attract positive thoughts. Sourcing note: As dictated by history & tradition, true red alaea salt is never sold and can only be given away or traded. In order to include this incredibly healing ingredient in our products, we purchase a distinct variation of red alaea. Its story begins along the rocky coast of Northern California where the cool, clear saltwater of the Pacific Ocean flows in. Naturally filtered into salt ponds nearby, this pure solar-evaporated sea salt is enriched with purified red alaea clay harvested deep in the emerald green rain forests of Kauai.

One significant role of this foundational vitamin is the formation and maintenance of collagen, the basis of the connective tissue found in our skin, bones, and teeth. Collagen, and therefore Vitamin C, is vital for supporting and shaping our body and skin and helping wounds to heal. A powerful antioxidant, it prevents free radicals from generating, offering much-needed protection from daily aggressors such as stress, pollution, and environmental exposure. Vitamin C plays a critical role in not only protecting our skin cells but in creating and maintaining them as well. With it, you are feeding your skin for both today and your future. Our concentrated, powdered form (L-Ascorbic Acid, made from a non-GMO vegetal source of sorbitol) activates fresh at the time of use for treatments with The Clean Dirt and The Problem Solver, helping to brighten, decongest, and wash away dead skin cells and tissue. Our Vitamin C is included alongside clarifying sodium bicarbonate in these two formulas, where it balances the pH levels for compatibility across skin types. Did you know that Vitamin C can also neutralize chlorine and ammonia in your tap water, helping to prevent the dryness and irritation that often comes with daily cleansing or showering? This, and so many reasons, is why The Clean Dirt never leaves my shower. Separately, our supercharged, oil-soluble form of Vitamin C ester (tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate), featured in The Happy Galaxy, absorbs impressively into the skin, penetrating past the outer layer to deeply nourish and actively restore our skin's connective tissue and collagen synthesis from neck to toes.

In many parts of Asia, this ingredient has been used for centuries for its ability to deeply and gently cleanse your pores, absorbing minerals, toxins, impurities, and other harmful substances from your skin. It is known as the \"black diamond\" of healers and addresses everything from acne to eczema with grace and ease. Once brought to life with water, bamboo charcoal releases many beneficial minerals, such as calcium, potassium, and magnesium. Featured in: [The Problem Solver](https://may-lindstrom-skin.myshopify.com/products/the-problem-solver) Sodium Bicarbonate Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) is an effective exfoliant, brightening and toning the skin, reducing congestion and stagnation, and providing natural antibacterial properties that are helpful in acne-prone and reactive skin. When combined with fresh, water-activated Vitamin C and mineral-rich salts, the fizzing effect and extraordinary brightening and refining results The Problem Solver and The Clean Dirt are famous for is born. It's important to note that sodium bicarbonate on its own is alkaline, and the key in formulation is always respect to proportion and integration with other complementary ingredients. Sodium Bicarbonate is an incredible asset to skin when used at a proper ratio and balanced by an acid - in our case, our antioxidant superpower Vitamin C. Our formulations are designed to stay within a 4 - 5.5 pH range on a scale of 1-14, with 1 being the most acidic, and 14 being the most alkaline. This can vary slightly due to the natural ingredients from batch to batch, as well as more significantly with the influence of your own water source when blending each fresh treatment. This range is ideal as the outer layer of the skin needs to be slightly acidic to maintain proper skin-barrier function.

While clove trees of today are grown all over the world, they were once exclusively found on the Maluku islands, formerly known as the \"Spice Islands\" of Indonesia. During this monopoly, the highly-priced clove was traded with as much friction as crude oil is today. Cloves are essentially the immature, unripe flower buds of the clove tree. Twice a year these buds announce they are ready for harvest as they transition from a pale green to a bright red color. They are picked by hand and dried in the sun where they turn to their signature dark brown color. Known as the \"super spice\" among natural healers for its incredibly high antioxidant content, clove is also a rich source of beneficial minerals calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc, as well as vitamins A and C. Clove contains the active compound eugenol, which has remarkable anti-fungal, antiseptic, and anti-bacterial properties, making this robust spice an excellent remedy for inflammatory skin conditions such as acne and dermatitis. With its vibrant nutritional profile and healing properties, clove keeps skin healthy and blemish-free. Sourcing note: Dedicated to environmentally-friendly agricultural practices, this ingredient has been added to our Ethical Global Sourcing Program. Our clove powder is shipped directly from a small organic farming cooperative in Sri Lanka to our kitchen in Los Angeles.

Whether the star of the hunger-inducing scent of freshly baked cookies or the seductive fragrance of your favorite perfume, vanilla is treasured by many. The sweet smell of vanilla has been shown to be a highly effective antidepressant, mood enhancer, and health booster due to a component called vanillin hydroxybenzaldehydem. Soothing and harmonizing, vanilla has been shown in studies to help comfort, stabilize, and induce feelings of relaxation. This sacred spice has been used in ritual offerings and as medicine and perfume by the Aztecs. This is where the irresistible and hopelessly addicting blend of vanilla and chocolate was born, as the Aztecs flavored their cacao-based drink with this prized, tropical bean. Cuttings of this ancient orchid were eventually taken to Africa by the French, where now 80% of the world's natural vanilla is produced. It generally takes three to five years for the vanilla plant to produce any blossoms. Not only does each flower require hand pollination, but it takes many additional months following harvest for curing to occur. Vanilla is one of the most labor-intensive of our ingredients to produce and is now the second most expensive spice in the world (following saffron). Highly sedative, vanilla helps to reduce skin inflammation and its powerful antibacterial components aid in clearing skin infections. Rich in skin-nourishing vitamins and minerals, vanilla naturally reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Its high content of antioxidants helps protect the skin from environmental damage, ensuring an even skin tone. Sourcing note: Unfortunately, today less than one percent of \"vanilla\" you find in food or fragrance comes from the vanilla flower itself (yes you read correctly - not even one percent), rather from synthetic reproductions. Our organic vanilla CO2 extract boasts an impressive 26% vanillin content, the component which gives it its rich, natural aroma. The manufacturing process of a CO2 extract involves none of the heat or moisture associated with steam distillation. The result is a deep and gentle extract, free from any chemical residue. Ours is a genuinely spectacular product made strictly from Madagascar beans. We are incredibly selective with each of our ingredients, but especially so when it comes to the standard of our difficult-to-obtain vanilla. With extremely limited stock available, we invest at a premium cost to ensure we can always maintain our obsessive quality commitment. Our same maker provides us with our fresh ground vanilla bean powder, equally expensive, and exceedingly delicious.

Native to the Mediterranean region of Europe, Romans were said to have used the holy flower to scent their baths, beds, clothes, and even hair, a fact that is reflected in the Latin root of the herb's name \"lavare\" meaning \"to wash.\" Besides Romans, many ancient cultures and healers around the world have used lavender in medicinal treatments and religious ceremonies. In the Middle Ages, it was believed that spouses who placed sprigs of lavender between their bedsheets would never argue. Tibetan monks and Ayurvedic healers are said to have used these purple beauties to treat depression and calm the mind, while in European folk medicine, lavender tea was prescribed to relieve insomnia and tension. It's been proven in modern medicine that the scent of lavender increases alpha waves in the area of the brain responsible for relaxation, helping to soothe common anxieties and allowing for better sleep at night. Besides its incredible aromatic and sedative properties, lavender boasts of skin healing benefits that make it a time-tested first aid treatment. True lavender essential oil is one of the most beneficial remedies for inflammatory conditions such as acne, dermatitis, and eczema. Its superior anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria, as well as regulate the over-excretion of sebum, increasing the healing process of scars at the same time. As a powerful antiseptic and pain reliever, lavender makes an invaluable remedy for burns, wounds, and all types of skin trauma, effectively regenerating scar tissue and the skin overall, leaving it healthy, glowing, and blemish-free.

I am transported to fantasies of my favorite Ben & Jerry's \"S'Mores\" ice cream flavor, which is laden with ripples of that creamy, white goodness. 2. Flashback to my childhood, picking the wild marshmallow flowers from the swampland next to the river on my property. My mother taught me about all the free and edible plants that were local to us, and this was a standout. \"Marshmallow\" sweets were originally made from the roots of these flowers, blended with sugar and egg white. Marshmallow is considered a superior medicinal plant that was used for centuries by the Romans, Egyptians, and Greeks. It is said that Hippocrates himself used marshmallow to heal wounds. Native to North Africa, western Asia, and Europe, marshmallow's Latin name Althea comes from the Greek (althein), which means \"to heal and cure.\" While all parts of the plant, from the root to the flower, were used for medicinal purposes, the root is exceptionally high in healing properties and boasts of impressive nutrient content. This is the part we utilize in The Clean Dirt and The Problem Solver. The long, thick, yellow root is not only rich in antioxidants but contains powerful antibacterial properties, which effectively prevent and treat infections, while the anti-inflammatory properties can speed up the healing process of the skin. Thanks to the containing flavonoids, it's especially beneficial for those suffering from eczema and psoriasis. As a rich mucilage source, marshmallow root has the capability to soothe and heal wounds and inflammation. Additionally, those mucilaginous properties slow down the aging process by supporting the skin's natural ability to hydrate and retain water. When you apply marshmallow root on your skin, you essentially moisturize, calm, and heal at the same time.

Among the valuable Boswellia tree extracts that researchers have identified, several stand out as being most beneficial, including terpenes and Boswellic acids, which protect healthy cells. Frankincense has the ability to strengthen skin and improve its tone, elasticity, and defense mechanisms against bacteria or blemishes, as well as to protect the skin's appearance as it matures. It may help tone and lift skin, reduce the severity of scars and acne, and heal wounds. It is also considered beneficial for fading stretch marks, surgery scars, marks associated with pregnancy, and healing dry and cracked skin. Studies suggest that it's the pentacyclic triterpene (natural, steroid-like) structure of frankincense oil that contributes to its soothing effect on irritated skin and its ability to reduce redness and skin irritation. It's also believed that the beautifully aromatic oil transmits messages to the limbic system of the brain, which is known to influence the nervous system. When inhaled, frankincense has been shown to reduce heart rate and high blood pressure, and lessen the symptoms of anxiety and chronic stress with its calming, grounding scent. This natural sleep aid helps open breathing passages, allowing you to ease into a gentle sleep.

Used as a blood flow stimulator in traditional medicine, cayenne works to increase blood circulation, delivering fresh oxygen and necessary healing nutrients to the skin cells, reducing inflammation as it detoxifies. Cayenne's high content of antioxidants, like skin-nourishing vitamins C, E, and A, help to increase the production of collagen while reducing the appearance of wrinkles, discoloration, or scars.

Some Asian cultures have long-credited the elephants' incredible life span and memory to the consumption of large growths of gotu kola in their habitat. Thanks to several extensive studies, the theory has now been confirmed: gotu kola is a remarkable memory booster and effectively supports cognitive function. The most significant role gotu kola plays in my world is that of a powerful skin healer. Both yesterday's and today's herbalists from around the world utilize gotu kola to treat burns, wounds, ulcers, and inflammatory skin conditions. Gotu kola boasts many nourishing compounds and active nutrients, but its most effective components are said to be a number of tripernoids that have been proven to have incredible effects on tissues and cells. These components not only stimulate the production of collagen, but also increase blood flow to damaged tissues, and increase antioxidants in wounds to provide protection. With its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and sedative properties, gotu kola offers a potent remedy for any inflammatory skin condition from eczema, to dermatitis, and psoriasis.

It originates in Southern Asia, where it has had its \"roots\" deep in the medicinal and spiritual traditions of India, China, and Southeast Asian cultures for centuries. Even today, orthodox Hindu brides and grooms take part in the ancient \"Haldi\" tradition, in which they cover their faces and bodies with turmeric paste before they take their vows. The brilliant golden-orange paste is said to protect from evil spirits, offer purification, and attract prosperity thanks to its color. Turmeric's potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibiotic, antiseptic, and analgesic qualities make this ancient magical spice a true all-around skin healer. Its active compound curcumin has gained a lot of deserved attention thanks to its unparalleled anti-inflammatory properties, which has nearly the same effect on pain as ibuprofen! Turmeric's potent antioxidants have been shown to protect healthy cells and neutralize free radicals by stabilizing them; thus delaying the appearance of aging or skin damage.

In many parts of Asia, this ingredient has been used for centuries for its ability to deeply and gently cleanse your pores, absorbing minerals, toxins, impurities, and other harmful substances from your skin. It is known as the \"black diamond\" of healers and addresses everything from acne to eczema with grace and ease. Once brought to life with water, bamboo charcoal releases many beneficial minerals, such as calcium, potassium, and magnesium.

I am transported to fantasies of my favorite Ben & Jerry's \"S'Mores\" ice cream flavor, which is laden with ripples of that creamy, white goodness. 2. Flashback to my childhood, picking the wild marshmallow flowers from the swampland next to the river on my property. My mother taught me about all the free and edible plants that were local to us, and this was a standout. \"Marshmallow\" sweets were originally made from the roots of these flowers, blended with sugar and egg white. Marshmallow is considered a superior medicinal plant that was used for centuries by the Romans, Egyptians, and Greeks. It is said that Hippocrates himself used marshmallow to heal wounds. Native to North Africa, western Asia, and Europe, marshmallow's Latin name Althea comes from the Greek (althein), which means \"to heal and cure.\" While all parts of the plant, from the root to the flower, were used for medicinal purposes, the root is exceptionally high in healing properties and boasts of impressive nutrient content. This is the part we utilize in The Clean Dirt and The Problem Solver. The long, thick, yellow root is not only rich in antioxidants but contains powerful antibacterial properties, which effectively prevent and treat infections, while the anti-inflammatory properties can speed up the healing process of the skin. Thanks to the containing flavonoids, it's especially beneficial for those suffering from eczema and psoriasis. As a rich mucilage source, marshmallow root has the capability to soothe and heal wounds and inflammation. Additionally, those mucilaginous properties slow down the aging process by supporting the skin's natural ability to hydrate and retain water. When you apply marshmallow root on your skin, you essentially moisturize, calm, and heal at the same time.

Some Asian cultures have long-credited the elephants' incredible life span and memory to the consumption of large growths of gotu kola in their habitat. Thanks to several extensive studies, the theory has now been confirmed: gotu kola is a remarkable memory booster and effectively supports cognitive function. The most significant role gotu kola plays in my world is that of a powerful skin healer. Both yesterday's and today's herbalists from around the world utilize gotu kola to treat burns, wounds, ulcers, and inflammatory skin conditions. Gotu kola boasts many nourishing compounds and active nutrients, but its most effective components are said to be a number of tripernoids that have been proven to have incredible effects on tissues and cells. These components not only stimulate the production of collagen, but also increase blood flow to damaged tissues, and increase antioxidants in wounds to provide protection. With its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and sedative properties, gotu kola offers a potent remedy for any inflammatory skin condition from eczema, to dermatitis, and psoriasis. The nutritious leafy green's antioxidants also help to reduce the appearance of scars and wrinkles, while slowing down the skin's visible aging process. Featured in: [The Problem Solver](https://www.maylindstrom.com/products/the-problem-solver) Clove When you pick up a jar of clove powder at your local supermarket, it's hard to imagine that just hundreds of years ago, wars were being fought over this aromatic, healing spice. While clove trees of today are grown all over the world, they were once exclusively found on the Maluku islands, formerly known as the \"Spice Islands\" of Indonesia. During this monopoly, the highly-priced clove was traded with as much friction as crude oil is today. Cloves are essentially the immature, unripe flower buds of the clove tree. Twice a year these buds announce they are ready for harvest as they transition from a pale green to a bright red color. They are picked by hand and dried in the sun where they turn to their signature dark brown color. Known as the \"super spice\" among natural healers for its incredibly high antioxidant content, clove is also a rich source of beneficial minerals calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc, as well as vitamins A and C. Clove contains the active compound eugenol, which has remarkable anti-fungal, antiseptic, and anti-bacterial properties, making this robust spice an excellent remedy for inflammatory skin conditions such as acne and dermatitis. With its vibrant nutritional profile and healing properties, clove keeps skin healthy and blemish-free. Sourcing note: Dedicated to environmentally-friendly agricultural practices, this ingredient has been added to our Ethical Global Sourcing Program. Our clove powder is shipped directly from a small organic farming cooperative in Sri Lanka to our kitchen in Los Angeles. This ensures unparalleled quality and freshness for our clients and also enhances the living standards of the farmers and communities in the project areas. At present, the association consists of 52 branch societies with more than 2,600 farmers. As a fundamental concept of organic agriculture, members practice mixed cropping systems and use a natural approach to pest control through companion-planting of shade trees, bug repellent plants, and medicinal herbs. Our vision is to support environmentally-friendly agriculture along with equally-treated and economically-empowered farmers and their communities.

Today, this diverse pepper is grown all over the world. Used as a blood flow stimulator in traditional medicine, cayenne works to increase blood circulation, delivering fresh oxygen and necessary healing nutrients to the skin cells, reducing inflammation as it detoxifies. Cayenne's high content of antioxidants, like skin-nourishing vitamins C, E, and A, help to increase the production of collagen while reducing the appearance of wrinkles, discoloration, or scars. Sourcing note: The famous heat in these impressive peppers comes from the phytochemical capsicum. The \"hot\" level is measured in \"HU,\" which stands for \"Scoville Heat Units,\" and can range from 0 to well over a million! We purchase our organic cayenne pepper with a rating of 35k H.U. to ensure your skin receives the circulatory-stimulating benefits without the burn. This unique ingredient works as a catalyst within The Problem Solver's formula, serving to open the skin's capillaries, increasing the effectiveness of the complementing herbs, minerals, and spices. Featured in: [The Problem Solver](https://www.maylindstrom.com/products/the-problem-solver) Learn more about each ingredient and why we love it on our [ingredients page](/pages/ingredients). First, know that you really can't mess it up! This is a beautiful moment for a slow, deep breath. :) The Problem Solver's skin-food ingredients will work their magic regardless of the texture or consistency of your treatment. This said, here's how to make the most of your experience for the ultimate in both result and pleasure: Be generous in your portioning - an overly small portion is the number one contributor to a flat or watery treatment. Using our [treatment bowl](https://www.maylindstrom.com/products/the-masque-treatment-bowl) and [brush](https://www.maylindstrom.com/products/the-facial-treatment-brush), blend 1/2 - 1 measured Tablespoon of powder with equal parts water into a fluffy, fizzing consistency. Stir gently, without crushing the airy bubbles. Do not add additional water before fully mixing your measured components - a few more moments for the powdered plant materials to rehydrate and find their form is often needed more than additional water or powder. Be sure not to miss the blending demonstration video in the \"how to use/tips & tricks\" tab on this page, too. We generally encourage a full treatment mask 1-3x/weekly, depending upon your unique history, goals, and challenges. Connect with us at care@maylindstrom.com for personalized guidance into your ultimate ritual. The Problem Solver is often at the very top of my recommendations for sensitive, inflamed, and reactive skin. While amazingly potent, this balanced formula has achieved the most extraordinary results in our clients with [rosacea, allergic dermatitis, eczema](https://www.maylindstrom.com/collections/skin-concerns-eczema-rosacea-dermatitis), and all types of inflammation. The Problem Solver's reputation for impact extends far beyond its accolades for conquering acne. If you have a skin history of severe sensitivity, we encourage you to connect with us at [care@maylindstrom.com](mailto:care@maylindstrom.com) so we may be at your side to offer support and tips as you explore. Variations on how you experience this special formula is normal. Some clients will notice only a mild tingle or even a cool or cold sensation. For others, it is not unusual to feel intense, temporary warming of the skin. This is similar to how two individuals may respond to the very same spicy meal - having entirely different impressions of the heat factor. Your personal experience may vary between sessions and with the state of your skin on each particular treatment day. Your response may be influenced by what other products are currently being used within your skincare ritual, where you are in your hormonal cycle, if you are healthy or feeling unwell, if you exfoliated beforehand or were in a hot bath, have had a glass of wine, etc. Whether you are at a heat level one or ten, the process and impact of these fresh and potent ingredients is intentional. Breathe deep into your unique sensation and enjoy the process. As your treatment dries and completes, heat tends to neutralize. We recommend you always rinse in the shower for ease, facing into the steam to wash your treatment away easily and without further stimulation. If it feels good, you may massage with the pads of your fingertips as you rinse, or simply let the water release for you. If you are feeling especially flushed or warm, finish with a cool water rinse before massaging your wet skin generously with [The Blue Cocoon](https://www.maylindstrom.com/products/the-blue-cocoon), followed by [The Jasmine Garden](https://www.maylindstrom.com/products/jasmine-garden). These two extraordinary and complementary formulas are actually quite different from each other in functionality and experience. [The Clean Dirt](https://www.maylindstrom.com/products/the-clean-dirt) is a brightening exfoliant, great for easing congestion, discoloration, hyperpigmentation, reducing post-acne spots and bringing major glow. I use this every 2-3 days, or about as often as I shampoo, always in the shower and typically in the morning. The Problem Solver is a warming treatment mask. It reduces and prevents breakouts, calms inflammation, lessens redness, evens tone, and generally solves all your problems. I use this once or twice a week, every week, typically alternating treatment days with The Clean Dirt. I typically mask evenings, but will fit in treatments wherever is possible. Both The Clean Dirt and The Problem Solver offer the very best of themselves when enjoyed consistently and alongside the other. My favorite treatment mask of all time is this blend of two of our heroes. The lush softness of The Honey Mud is the perfect complement to The Problem Solver's transformative power. To experience the glow for yourself, combine in our [treatment bowl](https://www.maylindstrom.com/products/the-masque-treatment-bowl): \u00bd - 1 true measured Tablespoon of The Problem Solver Equal parts water or [The Jasmine Garden](https://www.maylindstrom.com/products/jasmine-garden) Bring to a fizzing mousse consistency and incorporate 1 teaspoon of [The Honey Mud](https://www.maylindstrom.com/products/the-honey-mud). [Brush](https://www.maylindstrom.com/products/the-facial-treatment-brush) this mixture over clean skin, leaving from 10 to 60 minutes before rinsing clear in the shower, turning into the steam to wash away easily and with pleasure. *note: The natural salicylic acid from the wintergreen extract in [The Honey Mud](https://www.maylindstrom.com/products/the-honey-mud) will amplify the effects of The Problem Solver when combined within your ritual.

I have been battling adult acne for the past few years. I've tried it all. Used this mask once per the directions, followed with some oil, and the next morning, my acne was almost totally cleared. Spots that have been lingering for quite some time cleared up like they never existed. I've never seen anything like it. Truly a game changer for me.\" \u2014Madison \"It got rid of blackheads in my t-zone that I have struggled with since adolescence after ONE use. It was so beautiful and pleasant to use.\" \u2014Courtney \"Dear May, can you please create a product that solves my life problems the way The Problem Solver solves my skin problems? Also, can you make it have the same warm and calming smell? Thank you in advance!\" \u2014Elle \"The Reviews Don't Lie. This may be my favorite mask EVER. I have the kind of skin care collection that makes my friends envious and would make a financial advisor tremble. To say I have way too many products would be an understatement. It's a compulsion...what can I say? And yet, despite the dozens of masks I cycle through, this is the only one I am really, truly in love with, 'til death do us part. Finding a mask that I want to repurchase is a momentous occasion by itself. Finding one that I plan to repurchase repeatedly is...well, it's never happened until now. I don't know what sorcery is in this mask, but the somewhat fiery combination of ingredients (your skin will burn, but...you know...in like a really pleasant way) leaves my very dry, very finicky, often sensitive skin so bright and balanced. My face glows. The same effect has been replicated with every single person who comes into my house and accepts my aggressive invitation to try it. Normal skin, oily skin, dry skin, sensitive skin (yes, sensitive skin!)--this mask is for you. This is the Bernie Sanders of masks. A mask that is truly for the people. Add it to your cart right now. Try it as soon as it arrives. Thank me later.\" \u2014Bess \"The Problem Solver - man what a surprise of how effective it is!! I couldn't believe it! After first application, stubborn black heads have disappeared and my skin was so soft and cleansed. The tingling while using and the whole experience was perfect to my skin.\" \u2014Lydia \"Miracle in a jar!!! As someone that has been struggling with acne and hyperpigmentation for over 4 years, I can honestly tell you that I have not come across a mask that works nearly as well as this one. First of all, this mask is so much fun to make. It's like conducting a little science experiment in your bathroom. Secondly, the smell is DIVINE. The mask is an aromatherapy session in itself. Last but not least, IT WORKS. Immediately after washing this mask off, my skin looked radiant, my pores were undeniably smaller, my hyper pigmentation spots looked much lighter, and my skin overall felt more firm and lifted. The price point may be a little steep, but trust me, it is WORTH IT.\" \u2014Alyssa \"I read all the reviews and thought this mask was too good to be true. After using it once a week for the past month, I'm a convert. My skin is mature but oily. I use an older clean brush and a small glass bowl to prepare the mask and I leave it on around an hour. It's pulled out and healed my skin from blackheads, my large pores have diminished and blocked sebaceous glands are no more. My skin glows, is smooth and I don't have to wear foundation! I call it serious skin care because it is expensive, takes a little effort to prepare and apply, and does warm up upon application. It's a worthwhile investment in yourself.\" \u2014Debra \"It brought my black heads to the surface after using once. I have used it once and I noticed today that all the little tiny dots that I would have to use a strip for were now easy to remove by washing my face! I just pulled back on my nose and they were easy to wipe off. That is amazing and unexpected. My 34 year old sister was looking at my 44 year old skin and commented that my skin looked smooth, firm, tight and that she couldn't find any black heads. I'm very excited that I found this! I figured that if I ever wanted to really get rid of my skin issues I would have to go to a dermatologist. Not anymore. It's expensive and it's worth it.\" \u2014Echo \"This really goes deep into the skin and cleanses. I've always had problems with deep cleaning products because they almost always have small beads and other abrasive stuff which aggravates my skin and cause small tiny pimples. The Problem Solver doesn't do this at all. It deep cleanses, my blackheads and whiteheads are mostly gone. The smell of the spices is warm and simply comforting, taking me back to a place somewhere in my childhood. Now I am going to convince myself to splurge on blue cocoon and youth dew.\" \u2014Nadia \"Absolute love! It does sting once it's on but that dissipates after a few minute. Helps with my eczema and pigmentation!\" \u2014Sharada \"Solved problems I didn't know I had. I bought this as part of a deal and was not especially optimistic: I am 62 years old and The Problem Solver sounded potentially drying and irritating, and not particularly anti-ageing. I fully expected to pass it on to my two twenty something children (combination skins with the odd breakout) whilst keeping the Honey Mud for myself. I was wrong. This mask is great; great for me and great for twenty somethings. It doesn't make my face red at all and I hardly feel a tingle. I tried mixing it with water first, which was fine, but the real eye opener was when I made my own mix using argan oil and raw honey (May suggests mixing it with the Honey Mud on her site, this was my cheaper alternative). Mixed like this, with enough water to liquify and make the mask spreadable, the end result doesn't dry completely, but after 45 mins you have a glossy glaze that wipes off with lukewarm water and a taupe flannel (use white and you will have to chuck it, the stain never washes out completely). We all love it: skin is smoother, less blotchy, more luminous; if you have blackheads and/or milia, it helps and in my case, some redder patches in my cheeks disappear for about 24 hrs. The only drawback is that it is quite messy and time-consuming and be warned, without a mask brush I don't see how you would mix and apply this successfully.\" \u2014Veronica \"This is one of the best masks I have ever used. I don't use it for regular maintenance, rather when I have issues like rashes or eczema. I use it continuously at night for 3-5 days and I can start to feel the skin heal. It isn't the more easy mask to wear since there is a significant amount of stinging when you first apply it, but honestly, it is worth the results. Be sure to follow the mask with a soothing oil or serum.\" \u2014Sharada \"Effective, luxurious, FUN! There are few things in this life I enjoy more than a quality mask. When I saw the price tag, my eyebrow lifted significantly. Don't let that jar you too much -- the ingredients truly speak for themselves! I suggest applying this product with a brush as depicted in the video tutorial. Applying with fingers moves the product too much and it doesn't sit in a clean layer the way it needs to. I used one of my old synthetic foundation paddle brushes (not good quality, kind of a knockaround) and it did the job fabulously. I let it sit for a long time. I think it said 45 minutes (or until dry) but I went over a hair. When you apply the mask, you feel it \"activate\" right away. That's one of my favorite concepts with this mask: it remains inactive and as a result, maintains a more stable shelf life, which is invaluable since masks aren't an EVERYDAY thing. You can smell the different elements of this gorgeous earthy mask and it's SO satisfying. You pick up the bamboo-ey nature of the charcoal as a wave of cacao hits you, all the while this lovely tingly sensation sets in as the mask begins to sink into the skin and dry. At the end of it, I washed with water and a very slight touch of castile soap. My skin felt COMPLETELY recharged. This diverse blend of herbs, cacao and charcoal is a TRUE treat for your skin. Oh, and the best part? (at least for me) This mask OPENS up your skin so it can drink in all the nutrition you feed it after. If you have an extra penny and love healthy skin, this is the ticket, girl!\" \u2014Samuel \"Can't Live Without It. Well, I can live without it, but I wouldn't want to. This is the mask that made me believe in using masks frequently - I use this twice a week, every week, and it's been a major love of mine since I discovered it six months ago. I even have a backup, despite the fact this product will last months and months (the jar is huge). You mix the mask with water & apply in circular motions, then leave it on for 45 min - an hour. I almost always leave it on for the hour. It warms in the first 15 min of use (from cayenne & other spices), and over the course of the hour that I keep it on, it mellows and the warming sensation subsides. I was worried the first time I used it, but my extremely sensitive skin has never once suffered an adverse reaction from ingredients in the mask. Of course, check ingredients list & proceed with caution if you have sensitivities. The feeling I get the morning after using this mask makes it so addictive - my skin is clear, bright, and insanely soft. I cannot recommend this mask enough to those who want a deep clean or suffer from congested skin.\" \u2014Maggie \"I spent my Saturday evening with a luxurious coating of manuka honey and The Problem Solver on my face and chest, I felt like an Amazonian goddess!\" \u2014Ruby \"So expensive- but so worth it!! This product is hands down the best mask I have ever used. Wearing makeup every day can be very rough on your skin and this is the first product that has ever actually worked. It's very easy to use and mixing it up to that 'brownie batter like consistency' is actually kind of cool. You have to keep it on your skin for a while - longer than most masks- but you could easily be doing other stuff when wearing it. It doesn't drip or run so you can do your laundry or dishes. Or just relax, which is what I usually do! Being able to actually SEE a difference is amazing. If you suffer from congested skin this mask is for you- hands down. This product is a splurge. But your skin is definitely worth it.\" \u2014Allie \"Love at first mask...Without a doubt in my mind, the problem solver is the best thing to grace my skin. The problem solver is magic, it is the healing hand of some higher power. Let me start off by saying this: my skin is oily and acne prone so when I came across the problem solver, my eyes just about fell out of my head reading the description. Is it too good to be true? UMM NO and here's why: The packaging, like all of May's products, is consistent with dark glass jar and matching lid. The amount of product in the jar is generous. You get a lot considering you need 1 TSP!! mix in equal parts water and add more water carefully, you want the final result to be thick, not liquid. When creating the mask use a teacup or bowl and a clean foundation brush, you can use your fingers but trust me the application with a brush is much better and uniform. The dry powder turns into a rich, dark mousse. Once applied the true magic starts... The magic of this mask is that you can feel and see results happen within the first week of its use. When the mask begins to dry it has a slight tingly effect, not painful or annoying at all - it's barely noticeable unless you have crazy sensitive skin but even then the feel is more like a vacuum effect sucking out all the bad stuff (think of it that way). I recommend leaving this mask on until fully dry which means you get \"me-time\" or whatever-time to relax for about 45 mins. When the mask is dry and ready to rinse off you can use it as a mini exfoliator. Obviously, you don't see results right away but your skin does feel different, and in that moment you will know that there is a possibility of love at first use :) Right away, skin feels like a delicate flower petal, smooth and fresh. I notice the change in my skin every time I use the problem solver more frequently, no if's, and's, or but's for this miracle worker. It instantly clears blemishes the next day which makes it a great go-to for some emergency skin care for an event or occasion. If your skin is in need of a tune-up the problem solver is your new go-to. So what are you waiting for??\" \u2014Vikee \"I usually multitask when I have a mask on but the quality of your products really pushed me to take the time to enjoy the experience of using them which is very rare for me.\" \u2014Caitlin \"This mask is amazing, I use it every Sunday to deeply cleanse and refresh my skin. It also smells so good. My skin has been weird lately - dry, oily, acne-prone - basically all the things and this mask just balances out my skin and brightens it. The cayenne pepper in this mask definitely gives my skin a kick and warms it up but at the same time, doesn't feel abrasive or harsh. It leaves my skin feeling nourished afterward and I love following it up with some blue cocoon to give my skin that extra moisture. Absolutely love this :)\" \u2014Jennifer \"Everything about it felt special, the texture while mixing, the changing sensations on my skin, the SMELL (it made me want to take up baking or something so that I can smell it more often), the glow afterward!\" \u2014Alex \"I hated it at first. When I first tried this mask I really hated it, it gave me new spots every time I used it. However, the rest of my face felt really nice and that made me continue using it. I later realized these spots were the deep impurities within my skin brought up to the surface by the mask. And after a month of using it I HAVEN'T BROKEN OUT SINCE! I've been using this for 5 months now; and use it once to twice a week in combination with the Clean Dirt and Honey Mud and it became my favorite weekly ritual. I really feel the difference when I skip it and use other masks. This does REALLY WORK. The initial price point might be a little steep but when you look at the amount of product you're getting it's really not. Also the fact the ingredients are in dry form it means it has a really long shelf life which is always "}
