The network was then used to reconstruct a DWI dataset consisting of 14 b-values, each with three diffusion directions. For comparison, the dataset was also reconstructed with zero-padding and 3D-CNN. The experiments were performed with undersampling rates (R) of 4 and 6. Standard image quality metrics (SSIM and PSNR) were employed to provide quantitative assessments of the reconstructed image quality. Additionally, an advanced non-Gaussian diffusion model was employed to fit the reconstructed images from the different approaches, thereby generating a set of diffusion parameter maps. These diffusion parameter maps from the different approaches were then compared using SSIM as a metric.Both the reconstructed diffusion images and diffusion parameter maps from CRNN-DWI were better than those from zero-padding or 3D-CNN. Specifically, the average SSIM were 0.675 0.023 and 24.16 0.77 (R = 6), respectively, both of which were substantially higher than those of zero-padding or 3D-CNN reconstructions. The diffusion parameter maps from CRNN-DWI also yielded higher SSIM values for R = 4 (>0.8) and for R = 6 (>0.7) than the other two approaches (for R = 4, <0.7, and for R = 6, <0.65).CRNN-DWI is a viable approach for reconstructing highly undersampled DWI data, providing opportunities to reduce the data acquisition burden.

Noise2Recon uses unlabeled data by enforcing consistency between model reconstructions of undersampled scans and their noise-augmented counterparts. Noise2Recon was compared to compressed sensing and both supervised and self-supervised deep learning baselines. Experiments were conducted using retrospectively accelerated data from the mridata three-dimensional fast-spin-echo knee and two-dimensional fastMRI brain datasets. All methods were evaluated in label-limited settings and among out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, including changes in SNR, acceleration factors, and datasets. An extensive ablation study was conducted to characterize the sensitivity of Noise2Recon to hyperparameter choices.RESULTS: In label-limited settings, Noise2Recon achieved better structural similarity, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and normalized-RMS error than all baselines and matched performance of supervised models, which were trained with 14 * $$ 14\\times $$ more fully sampled scans. Noise2Recon outperformed including state-of-the-art fine-tuning and augmentation techniques, among low-SNR scans and when generalizing to OOD acceleration factors. Augmentation extent and loss weighting hyperparameters had negligible impact on Noise2Recon compared to supervised methods, which may indicate increased training stability.CONCLUSION: Noise2Recon is a label-efficient reconstruction method that is robust to distribution shifts, such as changes in SNR, acceleration factors, and others, with limited or no fully sampled training data.

The purpose of this paper is to improve this imaging by using a respiratory phase-resolved reconstruction approach, named motion-compensated low-rank reconstruction (MoCoLoR), which directly incorporates motion compensation into a low-rank constrained reconstruction model for highly efficient use of the acquired data.The MoCoLoR reconstruction is formulated as an optimization problem that includes a low-rank constraint using estimated motion fields to reduce the rank, optimizing over both the motion fields and reconstructed images. The proposed reconstruction along with XD and motion state-weighted motion-compensation (MostMoCo) methods were applied to 18 lung MRI scans of pediatric and young adult patients. The data sets were acquired under free-breathing and without sedation with 3D radial UTE sequences in approximately 5min. After reconstruction, they went through ventilation analyses. Performance across reconstruction regularization and motion-state parameters were also investigated.The in vivo experiments results showed that MoCoLoR made efficient use of the data, provided higher apparent SNR compared with state-of-the-art XD reconstruction and MostMoCo reconstructions, and yielded high-quality respiratory phase-resolved images for ventilation mapping. The method was effective across the range of patients scanned.The motion-compensated low-rank regularized reconstruction approach makes efficient use of acquired data and can improve simultaneous structural and functional lung imaging with 3D-UTE MRI. It enables the scanning of pediatric patients under free-breathing and without sedation.

Deep learning (DL) has recently revolutionized the field through image reconstruction techniques that allow unprecedented data undersampling rates. These fast acquisitions have the potential to considerably impact the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of DL-based reconstruction methods for CMR. We place special emphasis on state-of-the-art unrolled networks, which are heavily based on a conventional image reconstruction framework. We review the main DL-based methods and connect them to the relevant conventional reconstruction theory. Next, we review several methods developed to tackle specific challenges that arise from the characteristics of CMR data. Then, we focus on DL-based methods developed for specific CMR applications, including flow imaging, late gadolinium enhancement, and quantitative tissue characterization. Finally, we discuss the pitfalls and future outlook of DL-based reconstructions in CMR, focusing on the robustness, interpretability, clinical deployment, and potential for new methods.

Often, the FOV is too large or crops critical anatomy. We propose a deep learning framework, trained by radiologists' supervision, for automating FOV prescription. An intra-stack shared feature extraction network and an attention network are used to process a stack of 2D image inputs to generate scalars defining the location of a rectangular region of interest (ROI). The attention mechanism is used to make the model focus on a small number of informative slices in a stack. Then, the smallest FOV that makes the neural network predicted ROI free of aliasing is calculated by an algebraic operation derived from MR sampling theory. The framework's performance is examined quantitatively with intersection over union (IoU) and pixel error on position and qualitatively with a reader study. The proposed model achieves an average IoU of 0.867 and an average ROI position error of 9.06 out of 512 pixels on 80 test cases, significantly better than two baseline models and not significantly different from a radiologist. Finally, the FOV given by the proposed framework achieves an acceptance rate of 92% from an experienced radiologist.

We improve its design process to generate pulses with lower energy (by as much as 26%) and more accurate phase profiles. Concretely, the SLR algorithm consists of two steps: (1) an invertible transform between frequency selective pulses and polynomial pairs that represent Cayley-Klein (CK) parameters and (2) the design of the CK polynomial pair to match the desired magnetization profiles. Because the CK polynomial pair is bi-linearly coupled, the original algorithm sequentially solves for each polynomial instead of jointly. This results in sub-optimal pulses. Instead, we leverage a convex relaxation technique, commonly used for low rank matrix recovery, to address the bilinearity. Our numerical experiments show that the resulting pulses are almost always globally optimal in practice. For slice excitation, the proposed algorithm results in more accurate linear phase profiles. And in general the improved pulses have lower energy than the original SLR pulses.

SQUID-BLS was also obtained in each subject to provide susceptibility reference. A recent QSM method based on data-adaptive regularization was used to obtain susceptibility and R 2 * $$ {\\mathrm{R}}_2^{\\ast } $$ maps. Measurements of susceptibility and R 2 * $$ {\\mathrm{R}}_2^{\\ast } $$ were obtained in the right liver lobe. Linear mixed-effects analysis was used to estimate the contribution of specific acquisition parameters to QSM-BLS. Linear regression and Bland-Altman analyses were used to assess the relationship between QSM-BLS and SQUID-BLS/ R 2 * $$ {\\mathrm{R}}_2^{\\ast } $$ .Susceptibility maps showed high subjective quality for each acquisition protocol across different iron levels. High linear correlation was observed between QSM-BLS and SQUID-BLS at 1.5T (r2 range, [0.82, 0.84]) and (r2 range, [0.77, 0.85]) across different acquisition protocols. QSM-BLS and R 2 * $$ {\\mathrm{R}}_2^{\\ast } $$ were highly correlated at both range at 1.5T, [0.94, 3.0T, ppm) were observed for each protocol.This work evaluated the feasibility and performance of liver QSM-BLS across iron levels and acquisition protocols at 1.5T and 3.0T. High correlation and reproducibility were observed between QSM-BLS and SQUID-BLS across protocols and field strengths. In summary, QSM-BLS may enable reliable and reproducible quantification of liver iron concentration.

To solve these problems, we propose a deep learning-based dual-echo water-fat separation method. With IRB approval, raw data from 68 pediatric clinically indicated dual echo scans were analyzed, corresponding to 19382 contrast-enhanced images. A densely connected hierarchical convolutional network was constructed, in which dual-echo images and corresponding echo times were used as input and water/fat images obtained using the projected power method were regarded as references. Models were trained and tested using knee images with 8-fold cross validation and validated on out-of-distribution data from the ankle, foot, and arm. Using the proposed method, the average computational time for a volumetric dataset with ~400 slices was reduced from 10 min to under one minute. High fidelity was achieved (correlation coefficient of 0.9969, l1 error of 0.0381, SSIM of 0.9740, pSNR of 58.6876) and water/fat swaps were mitigated. I is of particular interest that metal artifacts were substantially reduced, even when the training set contained no images with metallic implants. Using the models trained with only contrast-enhanced images, water/fat images were predicted from non-contrast-enhanced images with high fidelity. The proposed water-fat separation method has been demonstrated to be fast, robust, and has the added capability to compensate for metal artifacts.

Compared with regulatory-approved R2 MRI, R2* MRI has superior speed and is available in most MRI scanners; however, the cross-vendor reproducibility of R2*-based LIC estimation remains unknown. Purpose To evaluate the reproducibility of LIC via single-breath-hold R2* MRI at both 1.5 T and 3.0 T with use of a multicenter, multivendor study. Materials and Methods Four academic medical centers using MRI scanners from three different vendors (three 1.5-T scanners, one 2.89-T scanner, and two 3.0-T scanners) participated in this prospective cross-sectional study. Participants with known or suspected liver iron overload were recruited to undergo multiecho gradient-echo MRI for R2* mapping at 1.5 T and 3.0 T (2.89 T or 3.0 T) on the same day. R2* maps were reconstructed from the multiecho images and analyzed at a single center. Reference LIC measurements were obtained with a commercial R2 MRI method performed using standardized 1.5-T spin-echo imaging. R2*-versus-LIC calibrations were generated across centers and field strengths using linear regression and compared using F tests. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the diagnostic performance of R2* MRI in the detection of clinically relevant LIC thresholds. Results A total of 207 participants (mean age, 38 years 20 [SD]; 117 male participants) were evaluated between March 2015 and September 2019. A linear relationship was confirmed between R2* and LIC. All calibrations within the same field strength were highly reproducible, showing no evidence of statistically significant center-specific differences (P > .43 across all comparisons). Calibrations for 1.5 T and 3.0 T were generated, as follows: for 1.5 T, LIC (in milligrams per gram [dry = -0.16 + 2.603 * R2* (in seconds-1); for 2.89 T, LIC (in milligrams per gram) = -0.03 + 1.400 * 10-2 R2* (in seconds-1); for 3.0 T, LIC (in milligrams per gram) = -0.03 + 1.349 * 10-2 R2* (in seconds-1). Liver R2* had high diagnostic performance in the detection of clinically relevant LIC thresholds (area under the ROC curve, >0.98). Conclusion R2* MRI enabled accurate and reproducible quantification of liver iron overload over clinically relevant ranges of liver iron concentration (LIC). The data generated in this study provide the necessary calibrations for broad clinical dissemination of R2*-based LIC quantification.

To address this, a low-power SiGe alternative to industry standard MRI pre-amplifier blocks has been proposed and its impact on imaging performance evaluated in a benchtop environment. The SiGe amplifier reduces power consumption 28x, but exhibits increased non-linearity and reduced dynamic range relative to industry standard amplifiers. This distorts the images, causing reduced contrast and a blurring of fine features. In conjunction with the amplifier, a semi-blind calibration and compensation framework has been proposed to remove artifacts caused by this non-linearity. Requiring the knowledge of the calibration signal bandwidth, the associated peak transmit powers, and the distorted baseband signals, a second non-linearity is constructed that when cascaded with the receive chain produces a linear response. This method was evaluated for both knee and phantom image datasets of peak input power -20dBm with a -40dBm peak input power image as reference. In the benchtop environment, industry standard amplifiers produced input normalized RMSEs of 0.0199 and 0.0310 for phantom and knee datasets, respectively. The low-power SiGe amplifier resulted in RMSEs of 0.0869 and 0.1130 which were reduced to 0.0158 and 0.0168 following compensation, for phantom and knee images respectively. The ability to effectively compensate for this reduced dynamic range encourages further investigation of low-power SiGe amplifiers for power limited MRI receive arrays.

With limited scan time, existing techniques often have limited spatial resolution, contrast resolution, and slice coverage. High fat concentrations yield complex errors in Look-Locker T1 methods. In this study, a dual-echo 2D radial T1 (DEradIR-T1) technique was developed for fast fat/water-separated T1 mapping. The DEradIR-T1 technique was tested in phantoms, 5 volunteers and 28 patients using a 3T clinical MRI scanner. In our study, simulations were performed to analyze the composite (fat + water) and water-only T1 under different echo times (TEs). In standardized phantoms, an inversion-recovery spin echo (IR-SE) sequence with and without fat saturation pulses served as a T1 reference. Parameter mapping with DEradIR-T1 was also assessed in vivo and values were compared with modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI). Bland-Altman analysis and two-tailed paired t-test were used to compare the parameter maps from DEradIR-T1 with the references. Simulations of the composite and water-only T1 under different TEs and levels of fat matched the in vivo studies. T1 maps from DEradIR-T1 on a =0.97) and a Calimetrix fat/water phantom (PWater = 0.56) matched with the references. In vivo T1 was compared with that of MOLLI: R Comp 2 = 0.77 ; R water 2 = 0.72 . In this work, intravoxel fat is found to have a variable, echo-time dependent effect on measured T1 values, and this effect may be mitigated using the proposed DRradIR-T1.

However, one of the major drawbacks is the loss of high-frequency details and textures in the output. The purpose of the study is to propose a novel refinement method that uses null-space kernel to refine k-space and improve blurred image details and textures.METHODS: The proposed method constrains the output of the DL to comply to the linear neighborhood relationship calibrated in the auto-calibration lines. To demonstrate efficacy, we tested our refinement method on the DL reconstruction under a variety of conditions (i.e., dataset, unrolled neural networks, and under-sampling scheme). Specifically, the method was tested on three large-scale public datasets (knee and brain) from fastMRI's multi-coil track.RESULTS: The proposed scheme visually reduces the structural error in the k-space domain, enhance the homogeneity of the k-space intensity. Consequently, reconstructed image shows sharper images with enhanced details and textures. The proposed method is also successful in improving high-frequency image details (SSIM, GMSD) without sacrificing overall image error (PSNR).CONCLUSION: Our findings imply that refining DL output using the proposed method may generally improve DL reconstruction as tested with various large-scale dataset and networks.

If image quality is inadequate either patients have to return for an additional scan, or a suboptimal interpretation is rendered. An automatic image quality assessment (IQA) would enable real-time remediation. Existing IQA works for MRI give only a general quality score, agnostic to the cause of and solution to low-quality scans. Furthermore, radiologists' image quality requirements vary with the scan type and diagnostic task. Therefore, the same score may have different implications for different scans. We propose a framework with multi-task CNN model trained with calibrated labels and inferenced with image rulers. Labels calibrated by human inputs follow a well-defined and efficient labeling task. Image rulers address varying quality standards and provide a concrete way of interpreting raw scores from the CNN. The model supports assessments of two of the most common artifacts in MRI: noise and motion. It achieves accuracies of around 90%, 6% better than the best previous method examined, and 3% better than human experts on noise assessment. Our experiments show that label calibration, image rulers, and multi-task training improve the model's performance and generalizability.

There is no widely adopted clinical protocol for DWI near metal since the commonly used EPI trajectory fails completely due to distortion from extreme off-resonance ranging from 2 to 20 kHz. We present a sequence that achieves DWI near metal with moderate b-values (400-500 s/mm2 ) and AND METHODS: Multispectral excitation with Cartesian sampling, view angle and kz phase encoding reduce in-plane and through-plane off-resonance artifacts, and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) spin-echo refocusing trains counteract T2* effects. The effect of random phase on the refocusing train is eliminated using a stimulated echo diffusion preparation. Root-flipped Shinnar-Le Roux refocusing pulses permits preparation of a high spectral bandwidth, which improves imaging times by reducing the number of excitations required to cover the desired spectral range. B1 sensitivity is reduced by using an excitation that satisfies the CPMG condition in the preparation. A method for ADC quantification insensitive to background gradients is presented.RESULTS: Non-linear phase refocusing pulses reduces the peak B1 by 46% which allows RF bandwidth to be doubled. Simulations and phantom experiments show that a non-linear phase CPMG pulse pair reduces B1 sensitivity. Application in vivo demonstrates complementary contrast to conventional multispectral acquisitions and improved visualization compared to DW-EPI.CONCLUSION: Volumetric and multispectral DW imaging near metal can be achieved with a 3D encoded sequence.

Purpose To assess the feasibility of using deep learning to automatically perform image-based background phase error correction in 4D flow MRI and to compare its effectiveness relative to manual image-based correction. Materials and Methods A convenience sample of 139 abdominopelvic 4D flow MRI acquisitions performed between January 2016 and July 2020 was retrospectively collected. Manual phase error correction was performed using dedicated imaging software and served as the reference standard. After reserving 40 examinations for testing, the remaining examinations were randomly divided into training (86% [85 of 99]) and validation (14% three-dimensional U-Net convolutional neural network. Flow measurements were the infrarenal aorta, common iliac arteries, common iliac veins, and inferior vena cava. Statistical analyses included Pearson correlation, Bland-Altman analysis, and F tests with Bonferroni correction. Results A total of 139 patients (mean age, 47 years 14 [standard deviation]; 108 women) were included. Inflow-outflow correlation improved after manual correction (rho = 0.94, P < .001) compared with that before correction (rho = 0.50, P < .001). Automated correction showed similar results (rho = 0.91, P < .001) and demonstrated very strong correlation with manual correction (rho = 0.98, P < .001). Both correction methods reduced inflow-outflow variance, improving mean difference from -0.14 L/min (95% limits of agreement: -0.38, 0.49) (automatically corrected). There was no significant difference in inflow-outflow variance between manual and automated correction methods (P = .10).

Zero echo time (ZTE) MR imaging produces a \"CT-like\" osseous contrast that might obviate CT.OBJECTIVE: This study investigated our institution's initial experience in implementing an isotropic ZTE MR imaging sequence for pediatric musculoskeletal examinations.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pediatric patients referred for extremity MRI at 3tesla (T) underwent ZTE MR imaging to yield images with contrast similar to that of CT. A radiograph-like image was also created with ray-sum image processing. We assessed ZTE-CT/XR anatomical image quality (Sanat) from 0 (nondiagnostic) to 5 (outstanding). Further, we made image comparisons on a 5-point scale (Scomp) (range of -2 = conventional CT/XR greater anatomical delineation to +2 = ZTE-CT/XR greater anatomical 0=same) cohorts: ZTE-XR to conventional ZTE-CT to conventional CT and (3) pathological lesion assessment on ZTE-XR to conventional radiography. We measured cortical thickness of ZTE-XR and ZTE-CT and compared these with conventional imaging. We calculated confidence interval of proportions, Wilcoxon rank sum test and intraclass correlation coefficients for inter-reader agreement.RESULTS: Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 consisted of 40, 20 and 35 cases, respectively (age range 0.6-23.0years). ZTE-CT versus CT and ZTE-XR versus radiography different (P=0.55 and P=0.31, respectively). Cortical delineation was rated diagnostic or better (score of 3, 4 or 5) in all cases (confidence interval of proportions = 100%) for ZTE-CT/XR. Similarly, intramedullary cavity delineation was rated diagnostic or better in all cases for ZTE-CT, and ZTE-XR was at least diagnostic in 58-63% of cases. For cohort 2, cortex and intramedullary cavity Scomp for ZTE-CT was comparable to those of conventional CT, with confidence interval of proportion (sum of score of -1 to +2) of 93-100% and 95%, respectively. Pathology visualized on ZTE-CT/XR was comparable; Scomp confidence interval of proportions was 95%/97-100%, with improved delineation of non-displaced fractures on ZTE-XR. Readers had moderate to intraclass correlation coefficient (range=0.60-0.93).CONCLUSION: Implementation of a diagnostic-quality ZTE MRI sequence in the pediatric population is feasible and can be performed as a complementary pulse sequence to enhance musculoskeletal MRI studies. Compared to conventional CT, ZTE has comparable cortical delineation, intramedullary cavity and pathology visualization. While not intended as a replacement for conventional radiography, ZTE-XR provides similar visualization of pathology.

Purpose To assess the image quality and performance of a highly accelerated, free-breathing, two-dimensional cine cardiac MRI sequence incorporating deep learning (DL) reconstruction compared with reference standard balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP). Materials and Methods A DL algorithm was developed to reconstruct custom 12-fold accelerated bSSFP cardiac MRI cine images from coil sensitivity maps using 15 iterations of separable three-dimensional convolutions and data consistency steps. The model was trained, validated, and internally tested in 10, two, and 10 adult human volunteers, respectively, based on vendor partner-supplied fully sampled bSSFP acquisitions. For prospective external clinical validation, consecutive children and young adults undergoing cardiac MRI from September through December 2019 at a single children's hospital underwent both conventional and highly accelerated short-axis bSSFP cine acquisitions in one MRI examination. Two radiologists scored overall and volumetric three-dimensional mesh image quality of all short-axis stacks on a five-point Likert scale and manually segmented endocardial and epicardial contours. Scan times and image quality were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Measurement agreement was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis. Results Fifty participants (mean age, 16 years 4 [standard deviation]; range, 5-30 years; 29 men) were evaluated. The mean prescribed acquisition times of accelerated scans (non-breath-held) and bSSFP (excluding breath-hold time) were 0.9 minute 0.3 versus 3.0 minutes 1.9 (P < .001). Overall and three-dimensional mesh image quality scores were, respectively, 3.8 0.6 versus 4.3 0.6 (P < .001) and 4.0 1.0 versus 4.4 0.8 (P < .001). Raters had strong agreement between all bSSFP and DL measurements, with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.76 to 0.97, near-zero mean differences, and narrow limits of agreement. Conclusion With slightly lower image quality yet much faster speed, deep learning reconstruction may allow substantially shorter acquisition times of cardiac MRI compared with conventional balanced steady-state free precession MRI performed for ventricular volumetry.

In many practices, 2D phase-contrast (2D-PC) has been used for blood flow quantification. 4D Flow MRI is a time-resolved volumetric acquisition that captures the vector field of blood flow along with anatomic images. 4D Flow MRI provides a simpler acquisition compared to 2D-PC and facilitates a more accurate and comprehensive hemodynamic assessment. Advancements in accelerated imaging have significantly shortened scan times of 4D Flow MRI while preserving image quality, enabling this technology to transition from the research arena to routine clinical practice. In this article, we review technical optimization based on our clinical experience of over 10 years with 4D Flow MRI. We also present pearls and pitfalls in the practical application of 4D Flow MRI, including how to quantify cardiovascular shunts, valvular or vascular stenosis, and experience increases, and as 4D Flow sequences and post-processing software become more broadly available, 4D Flow MRI will likely become an essential component of cardiac imaging for practices involved in the management of congenital and acquired structural heart disease.

MRI is increasingly being appreciated as an alternative to CT, not only for offering three-dimensional (3-D) imaging without radiation exposure at only slightly inferior spatial resolution, but also for its superior soft-tissue contrast and exclusive morpho-functional imaging capacities beyond the scope of CT. Continuing technical improvements and experience with this so far under-utilized modality contribute to a growing acceptance of MRI for an increasing number of indications, in particular for pediatric patients. This review article provides the reader with practical easy-to-use protocols for common clinical indications in children. This is intended to encourage pediatric radiologists to appreciate the new horizons for applications of this rapidly evolving technique in the field of pediatric respiratory diseases.

Still, there are challenges to incorporating neuroimaging biomarkers into multisite randomised controlled trials. In this paper, we provide the rationale for incorporating MRI and MRS biomarkers into the multisite, phase III high-dose erythropoietin for asphyxia and encephalopathy (HEAL) Trial, the MRI/S protocol and describe the strategies used for harmonisation across multiple MRI platforms.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Neonates with moderate or severe encephalopathy enrolled in the multisite HEAL trial undergo MRI and MRS between 96 and 144 hours of age using standardised neuroimaging protocols. MRI and MRS data are processed centrally and used to determine a brain injury score and quantitative measures of lactate and n-acetylaspartate. Harmonisation is achieved through standardisation-thereby reducing intrasite intersite real-time quality assurance monitoring and phantom scans.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: IRB approval was obtained at each participating site and written consent obtained from parents prior to participation in HEAL. Additional oversight is provided by an National Institutes of Health-appointed data safety monitoring board and medical monitor.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02811263; Pre-result.

Arterial structures showed high inter-reader concordance (range; rho = and the IVC (rho = 0.972), with moderate concordance in the PV (rho = 0.866). Conservation of mass analysis showed concordance between large vessels (SRA vs. IVC; rho = 0.806), small vessels (celiac vs. CHA+SpA; rho = 0.939), and capillary beds (CeT+SMA vs. PV; rho = 0.862). Splanchnic flow was increased in patients with portosystemic shunting (PSS) relative to control patients and patients with cirrhosis without PSS (P<0.05, difference range 0.11-0.68liter/m). HARR was elevated and PRI was decreased in patients with PSS (3.55 and 1.49, respectively) compared to both the control (2.11/3.18) and non-PSS (2.11/2.35) cohorts.DATA CONCLUSION: 4D flow MRI with was technically feasible, showing promise in quantifying the hemodynamic effects of cirrhosis. Proposed quantitative metrics of hepatic vascular resistance correlated with PSS.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 2.

Multi-echo complex-valued source images were reconstructed via gridding and coil combination, followed by confounder-corrected R 2 (=1/ T 2 ) mapping. A phantom containing 15 different concentrations of gadolinium solution (0-300 mM) was imaged at 3T. 3D multi-echo UTE cones with an initial TE of 0.036 ms and Cartesian CSE-MRI (IDEAL-IQ) sequences were performed. With institutional review board approval, 85 subjects (81 pediatric patients with iron overload + 4 healthy volunteers) were imaged at 3T using 3D multi-echo UTE cones with free breathing (FB cones), IDEAL-IQ with breath holding (BH Cartesian), and free breathing (FB Cartesian). Overall image quality of R 2 maps was scored by 2 blinded experts and compared by a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. For each pediatric subject, the paired R 2 maps were assessed to determine if a corresponding artifact-free 15 mm region-of-interest (ROI) could be identified at a mid-liver level on both images. Agreement between resulting R 2 quantification from FB cones and BH/FB Cartesian was assessed with Bland-Altman and linear correlation analyses.ROI-based regression analysis showed a linear relationship between gadolinium concentration and R 2 in IDEAL-IQ (y = 8.83x - 52.10, R2 = 0.995) as well as in cones (y = 9.19x - 64.16, R2 = 0.992). ROI-based Bland-Altman analysis showed that the mean difference (MD) was 0.15% and the SD was 5.78%. However, IDEAL-IQ R 2 measurements beyond 200 mM substantially deviated from a linear relationship for IDEAL-IQ (y = 5.85x + 127.61, R2 = 0.827), as opposed to cones (y = 10.87x - 166.96, R2 = 0.984). In vivo, FB cones R 2 had similar image quality with BH and FB Cartesian in 15 and 42 cases, respectively. FB cones R 2 had better image quality scores than BH and FB Cartesian in 3 and 21 cases, respectively, where BH/FB Cartesian exhibited severe ghosting artifacts. ROI-based Bland-Altman analyses were and 6.59% between FB cones and BH Cartesian and were 0.21% (MD) and 7.02% (SD) between FB cones and FB Cartesian, suggesting a good agreement between FB cones and BH (FB) Cartesian R 2 . Strong linear relationships were observed between BH Cartesian and FB cones (y = 1.00x + 1.07, R2 = 0.996) and FB Cartesian and FB cones (y = 0.98x + 1.68, R2 = 0.999).Golden-ratio re-ordered 3D multi-echo UTE Cones MRI enabled motion-robust, ungated, and free-breathing R 2 mapping of hepatic iron overload, with comparable R 2 measurements and image quality to BH Cartesian, and better image quality than FB Cartesian.

To cope with this challenge, this article leverages unpaired adversarial training for reconstruction networks, where the inputs are undersampled k-space and naively reconstructed images from one dataset, and the labels are high-quality images from another dataset. The reconstruction networks consist of a generator which suppresses the input image artifacts, and a discriminator using a pool of (unpaired) labels to adjust the reconstruction quality. The generator is an unrolled neural network - a cascade of convolutional and data consistency layers. The discriminator is also a multilayer CNN that plays the role of a critic scoring the quality of reconstructed images based on the Wasserstein distance. Our experiments with knee MRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed unpaired training enables diagnostic-quality reconstruction when high-quality image labels are not available for the input types of interest, or when the amount of labels is small. In addition, our adversarial training scheme can achieve better image quality (as rated by expert radiologists) compared with the paired training schemes with pixel-wise loss.

However, undersampling during MRI acquisition as well as the overparameterized and non-transparent nature of deep learning (DL) leaves substantial uncertainty about the accuracy of DL reconstruction. With this in mind, this study aims to quantify the uncertainty in image recovery with DL models. To this end, we first leverage variational autoencoders (VAEs) to develop a probabilistic reconstruction scheme that maps out (low-quality) short scans with aliasing artifacts to the diagnostic-quality ones. The VAE encodes the acquisition uncertainty in a latent code and naturally offers a posterior of the image from which one can generate pixel variance maps using Monte-Carlo sampling. Accurately predicting risk requires knowledge of the bias as well, for which we leverage Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) as a proxy for mean-squared-error (MSE). A range of empirical experiments is performed for Knee MRI reconstruction under different training losses (adversarial and pixel-wise) and unrolled recurrent network architectures. Our key observations indicate that: 1) adversarial losses introduce more uncertainty; and 2) recurrent unrolled nets reduce the prediction uncertainty and risk.

The few works which have tried complex-valued networks have not fully assessed their impact on phase. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to fully investigate end-to-end complex-valued convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for accelerated MRI reconstruction and in several phase-based applications in comparison to 2-channel real-valued networks.Several complex-valued activation functions for MRI reconstruction were implemented, and their performance was compared. Complex-valued convolution was implemented and tested on an unrolled network architecture and a U-Net-based architecture over a wide range of network widths and depths with knee, body, and phase-contrast datasets.Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrated that complex-valued CNNs with complex-valued convolutions provided superior reconstructions compared to real-valued convolutions with the same number of trainable parameters for both an unrolled network architecture and a U-Net-based architecture, and for 3 different datasets. Complex-valued CNNs consistently had superior normalized RMS error, structural similarity index, and peak SNR compared to real-valued CNNs.Complex-valued CNNs can enable superior accelerated MRI reconstruction and phase-based applications such as fat-water separation, and flow quantification compared to real-valued convolutional neural networks.

Additionally, we propose a novel neural network design based on (2+1)D spatiotemporal convolutions to produce more accurate dynamic MRI reconstructions than conventional 3D convolutions. The network is trained on fully sampled 2D cardiac cine datasets collected from 11 healthy volunteers with IRB approval. DL-ESPIRiT is compared against a state-of-the-art parallel imaging and compressed sensing method known as l 1 -ESPIRiT. The reconstruction accuracy of both methods is evaluated on retrospectively undersampled datasets (R=12) with respect to standard image quality metrics as well as automatic deep learning-based segmentations of left ventricular volumes. Feasibility of DL-ESPIRiT is demonstrated on two prospectively undersampled datasets acquired in a single heartbeat per slice.RESULTS: The (2+1)D DL-ESPIRiT method produces higher fidelity image reconstructions when compared to l 1 -ESPIRiT reconstructions with respect to standard image quality metrics (P < .001). As a result of improved image quality, segmentations made from (2+1)D DL-ESPIRiT images are also more accurate than segmentations from l 1 -ESPIRiT images.CONCLUSIONS: DL-ESPIRiT synergistically combines a robust parallel imaging model and deep learning-based priors to produce high-fidelity reconstructions of retrospectively undersampled 2D cine data acquired with reduced FOV. Although a proof-of-concept is shown, further experiments are necessary to determine the efficacy of DL-ESPIRiT in prospectively undersampled data.

However, patient motion corrupts T2 * estimates.PURPOSE: To develop and evaluate a motion-robust, simultaneous cardiac and liver T2 * imaging approach using non-Cartesian, rosette sampling and a reconstruction ferumoxytol-containing phantoms (26-288mug/mL). Eight healthy subjects and 18 patients referred for clinically indicated iron overload assessment.FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 1.5T, 2D Cartesian and rosette gradient echo T2 * values were validated in ferumoxytol phantoms. In healthy subjects, test-retest and spatial coefficient of variation (CoV) analysis was performed during three breathing conditions. Cartesian and rosette T2 * were compared using correlation and Bland-Altman analysis. Images were rated by three experienced radiologists on a 5-point scale.STATISTICAL TESTS: Linear regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Student's t-testing were used to compare reproducibility and variability metrics in Cartesian and rosette scans. The Wilcoxon rank test was used to assess reader score comparisons and reader reliability was measured using intraclass correlation analysis.RESULTS: Rosette R2* (1/T2 *) was linearly correlated with ferumoxytol concentration (r2 = 1.00) and not significantly different than Cartesian values (P = 0.16). During breath-holding, ungated rosette liver and heart values. During free-breathing and failed breath-holding, Cartesian images had very poor to average image quality with significant artifacts, whereas rosette remained very good, with minimal artifacts (P = 0.001).DATA CONCLUSION: Rosette k-sampling with a model-based reconstruction offers a clinically useful motion-robust T2 * mapping approach for iron quantification.

Limited data exist on direct measurement of AVVR by 4DF CMR in pediatric congenital heart disease (CHD). We aimed to validate direct measurement of the AVVR jet as accurate and reliable compared to the volumetric method (clinical standard by 2D CMR) and as a superior method of internal validation than the annular inflow method.METHODS: We identified 44 consecutive patients with diverse CHD referred for evaluation of AVVR by CMR. 1.5T or 3T scanners, intravenous contrast, and a combination of parallel imaging and compressed sensing were used. Four methods of measuring AVVR volume (RVol) were used: volumetric method (VOL; 2D free precession - semilunar valve forward flow (SLFF); annular inflow method (AIM)=atrioventricular valve forward flow [AVFF] - semilunar valve net flow (SLNF); and direct measurement (JET). AVFF was measured using static and retrospective valve tracking planes. SLFF, SLNF, AVFF, and JET were measured by 4DF phase contrast. Regurgitant fraction was calculated as [RVol/(RVol+SLNF)]*100. Statistical methods included Spearman, Wilcoxon rank sum test/Student paired t-test, Bland Altman analysis, and intra-class coefficient (ICC), where appropriate.RESULTS: Regurgitant fraction by JET strongly correlated with the indirect methods (VOL and AIM) (rho=0.73-0.80, p<0.001) and was similar to VOL with a median difference (interquartile range) of -1.5% (-8.3-7.2%; p=0.624). VOL had weaker correlations with AIM and JET (rho=0.69-0.73, p<0.001). AIM underestimated RF by 3.6-6.9% compared to VOL and JET, p<0.03. Intra- and inter- observer reliability were excellent for all methods (ICC 0.94-0.99). The mean (standard deviation) inter-observer difference for VOL was 2.4% (5.1%), p<0.05.CONCLUSIONS: In a diverse cohort of pediatric CHD, measurement of AVVR using JET is accurate and reliable to VOL and is a superior method of internal validation compared to AIM. This study supports use of 4DF CMR for measurement of AVVR, obviating need for expert prospective prescription during image acquisition by 2D CMR.

This reconstruction is vastly under-determined, heavily stressing computing resources as well as memory management and storage. To overcome these challenges, we leverage intrinsic three-dimensional (3D) trajectories, such as 3D radial and 3D cones, with ordering that incoherently cover time and k-space over the entire acquisition. We then propose two innovations: (a) A compressed representation using multiscale low-rank matrix factorization that constrains the reconstruction problem, and reduces its memory footprint. (b) Stochastic optimization to reduce computation, improve memory locality, and minimize communications between threads and processors. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method on DCE imaging acquired with a golden-angle ordered 3D cones trajectory and pulmonary imaging acquired with a bit-reversed ordered 3D radial trajectory. We compare it with \"soft-gated\" dynamic reconstruction for DCE and respiratory-resolved reconstruction for pulmonary imaging.RESULTS: The proposed technique shows transient dynamics that are not seen in gating-based methods. When applied to datasets with irregular, or non-repetitive motions, the proposed method displays sharper image features.CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a method that can reconstruct massive 3D dynamic image series in the extreme undersampling and extreme computation setting.

These artifacts often yield images that are of non-diagnostic quality. To detect such artifacts, images are prospectively evaluated by experts for their diagnostic quality, which necessitates patient-revisits and rescans whenever non-diagnostic quality scans are encountered. This motivates the need to develop an automated framework capable of accessing medical image quality and detecting diagnostic and non-diagnostic images. In this paper, we explore several convolutional neural network-based frameworks for medical image quality assessment and investigate several challenges therein.

Recent trends in accelerating MRI employ data-centric deep learning frameworks due to its fast inference time and 'one-parameter-fit-all' principle unlike in traditional model-based acceleration techniques. Unrolled deep learning framework that combines the deep priors and model knowledge are robust compared to naive deep learning based framework. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale unrolled deep learning framework which learns deep image priors through multi-scale CNN and is combined with unrolled framework to enforce data-consistency and model knowledge. Essentially, this framework combines the best of both learning paradigms:model-based and data-centric learning paradigms. Proposed method is verified using several experiments on numerous data sets.

We compare the accuracy of gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced 4DF on a 1.5T magnet to children with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF) to measure pulmonary net flow (PNF) as a reflection of pulmonary regurgitation, forward flow (FF) and ventricular volumetry. Thirty-four consecutive cases were included. 2D PCs were obtained at the valve level. Using 4DF, we measured PNF at the valve and at the main and branch pulmonary arteries. PNF measured at the valve by 4DF demonstrated the strongest correlation (r=0.87, p<0.001) and lowest mean difference (3.59.4mL/beat) to aortic net flow (ANF). Semilunar FF and stroke volume of respective ventricle demonstrated moderate-strong correlation by 4DF (r=0.66-0.81, p<0.001) by 2D (r=0.81-0.84, p<0.001) similar correlations and mean differences between volumes Ejection fraction 71min, p<0.001). 4DF provides highly reproducible and accurate measurements of flow with slight overestimation of RV volumes compared to 2D in pediatric rTOF. 4DF offers important advantages in this population with long-term monitoring needs.

When applied to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CS has the potential to dramatically shorten MRI scan times, increase diagnostic value, and improve overall patient experience. However, CS has several shortcomings which limit its clinical translation such as: 1) artifacts arising from inaccurate sparse modelling assumptions, 2) extensive parameter tuning required for each clinical application, and 3) clinically infeasible reconstruction times. Recently, CS has been extended to incorporate deep neural networks as a way of learning complex image priors from historical exam data. Commonly referred to as unrolled neural networks, these techniques have proven to be a compelling and practical approach to address the challenges of sparse CS. In this tutorial, we will review the classical compressed sensing formulation and outline steps needed to transform this formulation into a deep learning-based reconstruction framework. Supplementary open source code in Python will be used to demonstrate this approach with open databases. Further, we will discuss considerations in applying unrolled neural networks in the clinical setting.

ADC measured by DW-SD and DW-EPI were compared in bone marrow, muscle, and lesions.Wilcoxon rank-sum test and confidence interval of proportions (CIOP) were for Scomp , Student's t-test, coefficient of (COV), values, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for interreader agreement.DW-SD and DW-EPI ADC values for bone marrow, muscle, and lesions were not significantly different (P = 0.3, P = 0.2, and P = 0.27, respectively) and had an overall ADC COV of 14.8% (95% confidence interval: 12.3%, 16.9%) proportional bias on Bland-Altman analysis. Sanat CIOP was rated diagnostic or better (score of 3, 4, or 5) in 72-98% of cases for bone marrow, muscle, and soft tissues. DW-SD was equivalent to or preferred over DW-EPI in muscles and soft tissues, with CIOP 86-93% and 93%, respectively. Lesions were equally visualized on and DW-EPI in 40-51%, with DW-SD preferred in 44-56% of cases. DW-SD was rated significantly better than DW-EPI across all comparative variables that included bone marrow, muscle, soft tissue, cartilage, and lesions (P<0.05).

Despite the large number of retrospective studies using DL, there are fewer applications of DL in the clinic on a routine basis. To address this large translational gap, we review the recent publications to determine three major use cases that DL can have in MRI, namely, that of model-free image synthesis, model-based image reconstruction, and image or pixel-level classification. For each of these three areas, we provide a framework for important considerations that consist of appropriate model training paradigms, evaluation of model robustness, downstream clinical utility, opportunities for future advances, as well recommendations for best current practices. We draw inspiration for this framework from advances in computer vision in natural imaging as well as additional healthcare fields. We further emphasize the need for reproducibility of research studies through the sharing of datasets and software. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 2.

Here, we use four such age estimators to show that epigenetic aging can be reversed in humans. Using a protocol intended to regenerate the thymus, we observed protective immunological changes, improved risk indices for many age-related diseases, and a mean epigenetic age approximately 1.5years less than baseline after 1year of treatment (-2.5-year change compared to no treatment at the end of the study). The rate of epigenetic aging reversal relative to chronological age accelerated from -1.6year/year from 0-9month to -6.5year/year from 9-12month. The GrimAge predictor of human morbidity and mortality showed a 2-year decrease in epigenetic vs. chronological age that persisted six months after discontinuing treatment. This is to our knowledge the first report of an increase, based on an epigenetic age estimator, in predicted human lifespan by means of a currently accessible aging intervention.

Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. A total of 74 patients (23 women and 51 men with breast and prostate cancer, respectively) referred for standard-of-care whole-body bone scintigraphy (WBBS) were enrolled in this prospective study. All patients underwent a [99mTc]methyldiphosphonate ([99mTc]MDP) WBBS followed by Na[18F]F/[18F]FDG PET/MRI. Lesions detected by imaging modality were tabulated and a lesion-based and patient-based analysis was conducted.RESULTS: On a patient-based analysis, [99mTc]MDP WBBS identified skeletal lesions in 37 patients and PET/MRI in 45 patients. On a lesion-based analysis, WBBS identified a total of 81 skeletal lesions, whereas PET/MRI identified 140 lesions. Additionally, PET/MRI showed extra-skeletal lesions in 19 patients, including lymph nodes (16), prostate (4) lung (3), and liver (2) lesions.CONCLUSIONS: The ability of Na[18F]F/[18F]FDG PET/MRI to identify more skeletal lesions than 99mTc-MDP WBBS and to additionally identify extra-skeletal disease may be beneficial for patient care and represent an alternative to the single modalities performed separately. Na[18F]F/[18F]FDG PET/MRI is a promising approach for evaluation of skeletal and extra-skeletal lesions in a selected population of breast and prostate cancer patients.

We sought to determine how often DCE is used in PI-RADS v2 scoring.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from 388 patients who underwent prostate magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent biopsy from January 2016 through December 2017. In accordance with PI-RADS v2, DCE was deemed necessary if a peripheral-zone lesion had a diffusion-weighted imaging score of 3, or if a transition-zone lesion had a T2 score of 3 and diffusion-weighted imaging experienced technical failure. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis assessed the accuracy of prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) at different threshold values for differentiating lesions that would be equivocal with noncontrast technique. Accuracy of PSAD was compared to DCE using McNemar's test.RESULTS: Sixty-nine lesions 62 patients DCE for PI-RADS scoring. Biopsy of 10 (14%) of these lesions showed clinically significant cancer (Gleason score 7). In the subgroup of patients with equivocal lesions, those with clinically significant cancer had significantly higher PSADs than those with clinically insignificant lesions (means of 0.18 and 0.13 ng/mL/mL, respectively; P= 0.038). In this subgroup, there was no statistical difference in accuracy in determining clinically significant cancer between a PSAD threshold value of 0.13 and DCE (P= 0.25).CONCLUSIONS: Only 16% of our patients needed DCE to generate the PI-RADS version 2 score, raising the possibility of limiting the initial screening prostate MRI to a noncontrast exam. PSAD may also be used to further decrease the need for or to replace DCE altogether.

An MRI compatible wireless power transfer (WPT) system will be needed to realize this technology. An MRI WPT system must withstand the extreme electromagnetic environment of the scanner and cannot degrade MRI image quality. Here, a WPT system is developed for operation in MRI scanners using new microelectromechanical RF switch (RF MEMs) technology. The WPT system includes a class-E power amplifier, RF MEMs automated impedance matching, a primary coil array employing RF MEMs power steering, and a flexible secondary coil with class E rectification. To adapt WPT technology to MRI, techniques are developed for operation at high magnetic field, and to mitigate the RF interactions between the scanner and WPT system. A major challenge was the identification and suppression of noise and harmonic interference, by gating, filtering, and rectifier topologies. The system can achieve 63% efficiency while exceeding 13 W delivery over a coil distance of 3.5 cm. For continuous WPT beyond 5W, added filters and full-wave class E rectification lowers harmonic generation at some cost to efficiency, while image SNR reaches about 32% of the ideal. RF-gated WPT, which interrupts power transfer in the MRI signal acquisition interval, achieves SNR performance to within 1 dB of the ideal. With further refinement, the inclusion of WPT technology in MRI scanners appears completely feasible.

Purpose To assess the performance and caregiver and clinician acceptance of a pediatric-sized screen-printed flexible MRI coil array as compared with conventional coil technology. Materials and Methods A pediatric-sized 12-channel coil array was designed by using a screen-printing process. Element coupling and phantom signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were assessed. Subjects were scanned by using the pediatric printed array between September and November 2017; results were compared with three age- and sex-matched historical control subjects by using a commercial 32-channel cardiac array at 3 T. Caregiver acceptance was assessed by asking nurses, technologists, anesthesiologists, and subjects or parents to rate their coil preference. Diagnostic quality of the images was evaluated by using a Likert scale (5 = high image quality, 1 = nondiagnostic). Image SNR was evaluated and compared. Results Twenty study participants were evaluated with the screen-printed coil (age range, 2 days to 12 years; 11 male and nine female subjects). Loaded pediatric phantom testing yielded similar noise covariance matrices and only slightly degraded SNR for the printed coil as compared with the commercial coil. The caregiver acceptance survey yielded a mean score of 4.1 0.6 (scale: 1, preferred the commercial coil; 5, preferred the printed coil). Diagnostic quality score was 4.5 0.6. Mean image SNR was 54 49 (paraspinal muscle), 78 51 (abdominal wall muscle), and 59 35 (psoas) for the printed coil, as compared with 64 55, 65 48, and 57 43, respectively, for the commercial coil; these SNR differences were not statistically significant (P = .26). Conclusion A flexible screen-printed pediatric MRI receive coil yields adequate signal-to-noise ratio in phantoms and pediatric study participants, with similar image quality but higher preference by subjects and their caregivers when compared with a conventional MRI coil.

A distributed, compressed sensing-based reconstruction was implemented on a four-node high-performance compute cluster and integrated into the clinical workflow.ASSESSMENT: In an Institutional Review Board-approved study with informed consent/assent, we implemented a targeted pediatric knee MRI exam for assessing pediatric knee pain. Pediatric patients were subselected for the exam based on insurance plan and clinical indication. Over a 2-year period, 47 subjects were recruited for the study and 49 MRIs were ordered. Date and time information was recorded for MRI referral, registration, and completion. Image quality was assessed from 0 (nondiagnostic) to 5 (outstanding) by two readers, and consensus was subsequently reached.STATISTICAL TESTS: A Wilcoxon rank-sum test assessed the null hypothesis that the targeted exam times compared with conventional knee exam times were unchanged.RESULTS: Of the 49 cases, 20 were completed on the same day as exam referral. Median time from registration to exam completion was 18.7 minutes. Median reconstruction time for T2 Shuffling was reduced from 18.9 minutes to 95 seconds using the distributed implementation. Technical fees charged for the targeted exam were one-third that of the routine clinical knee exam. No subject had to return for additional imaging.DATA CONCLUSION: The targeted knee MRI exam is feasible and reduces the imaging time, cost, and barrier to same-day MRI access for pediatric patients.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 Technical Efficacy: Stage 6 J.

MRIs were performed at 1.5 T or 3 T and included multiplanar uterine fibroid symptom severity scores, and health-related quality of life scores, as well as imaging findings were evaluated.STATISTICAL TESTS: Patients were separated into two subgroups according to whether MRI provided additional findings to the initial US. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed.RESULTS: Pelvic MRI provided additional information in 162 patients (44%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 39-49%). The most common significant adenomyosis (22%), endometriosis (17%), and partially endocavitary fibroids (15%). Women with pelvic pain, health-related quality of life scores less than 30 out of 100, or multiple fibroids visualized on US had greater odds of additional MRI findings (odds ratio [OR] 1.68, 2.26, 1.63; P = 0.02, 0.004, 0.03, respectively), while nulliparous women had reduced odds (OR 0.55, P = 0.01). Patients with additional MRI findings were treated less often with uterine fibroid embolization (14% vs. 36%, P < 0.001) or MR-guided focused US (1% vs. 5%, P = 0.04), and more often with medical management (17% vs. 8%, P = 0.01).DATA CONCLUSION: Pelvic MRI revealed additional findings in more than 40% of women presenting with symptoms initially ascribed to fibroids by US. Further evaluation using MRI is particularly useful for parous women with pelvic pain, poor quality of life scores, and/or multiple fibroids.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Technical Efficacy: Stage 3 J. Magn.

To compensate for the T1 recovery during readout, a phase-cycling method was used. Both compensation methods were validated in phantoms. The optimized sequence was compared with an EPI diffusion sequence for image distortion, contrast, ADC, and acoustic noise level in phantoms. The sequence was evaluated in 1 brain volunteer, 5 prostate volunteers, and 10 pediatric patients with joint diseases.Combination of several eddy-current compensation methods reduced the artifact to an acceptable level. Phase cycling reduced T1 recovery contamination during readout. In phantom scans, the optimized sequence generated similar image contrast to the EPI diffusion sequence, and ADC maps between the sequences were comparable; sd-DWI had significantly lower acoustic noise (P < .05). In vivo brain scan showed reduced image distortion in sd-DWI compared with the EPI diffusion, although residual motion artifact remains due to brain pulsation. The prostate scans showed that sd-DWI can provide similar ADC compared with EPI diffusion, with no image distortion. Patient scans showed that the sequence can clearly depict joint lesions.An sd-DWI sequence was developed and optimized. Compared with conventional EPI diffusion, sd-DWI provided similar diffusion contrast, accurate ADC measurement, improved image quality, and minimal ambient scanning noise. The sequence showed the ability to obtain in vivo diffusion contrast in relatively motion-free body regions, such as prostate and joint.

The time and resource intensive computations require tradeoffs between accuracy and speed. In addition, state-of-the-art compressed sensing (CS) analytics are not cognizant of the image diagnostic quality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CS framework that uses generative adversarial networks (GAN) to model the (low-dimensional) manifold of high-quality MR images. Leveraging a mixture of least-squares (LS) GANs and pixel-wise l1/l2 cost, a deep residual network with skip connections is trained as the generator that learns to remove the aliasing artifacts by projecting onto the image manifold. The LSGAN learns the texture details, while the l1/l2 cost suppresses high-frequency noise. A discriminator network, which is a multilayer convolutional neural network (CNN), plays the role of a perceptual cost that is then jointly trained based on high-quality MR images to score the quality of retrieved images. In the operational phase, an initial aliased estimate (e.g., simply obtained by zero-filling) is propagated into the trained generator to output the desired reconstruction. This demands a very low computational overhead. Extensive evaluations are performed on a large contrast-enhanced MR dataset of pediatric patients. Images rated by expert radiologists corroborate that GANCS retrieves higher quality images with improved fine texture details compared with conventional Wavelet-based and dictionary-learning-based CS schemes as well as with deep-learning-based schemes using pixel-wise training. In addition, it offers reconstruction times of under a few milliseconds, which are two orders of magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art CS-MRI schemes.

Each exam acquired a short readout scan (1.18 ms 0.38) and a long readout scan (3.35 ms 0.74) at 3 T. Short readout scans, with longer scan times but negligible off-resonance blurring, were used as reference images and augmented with additional off-resonance for supervised training examples. Long readout scans, with greater off-resonance artifacts but shorter scan time, were corrected by autofocus and Off-ResNet and compared with short readout scans by normalized RMS error, structural similarity index, and peak SNR. Scans were also compared by scoring on 8 anatomical features by two radiologists, using analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey's test and two one-sided t-tests. Reader agreement was determined with intraclass correlation.The total scan time for long readout scans was on average 59.3% shorter than short readout scans. Images from Off-ResNet had superior normalized RMS error, structural similarity index, and peak SNR compared with uncorrected images across 1 kHz off-resonance (P < .01). The proposed method had superior normalized RMS error over -677 Hz to +1 kHz and superior structural similarity index and peak SNR over 1 kHz compared with autofocus (P < .01). Radiologic scoring demonstrated that long readout scans corrected with Off-ResNet were noninferior to short readout scans (P < .05).The proposed method can correct off-resonance artifacts from rapid long-readout 3D cones scans to a noninferior image quality compared with diagnostically standard short readout scans.

Realistic anatomic models, particularly those of the abdominal wall, are needed to take full advantage of the capabilities of these simulation tools. We describe a method for converting fat-water-separated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes to anatomical models for ultrasound simulations. These acoustic models are used to map acoustic imaging parameters, such as speed of sound and density, to grid points in an ultrasound simulation. The tissues of these models are segmented from the MRI volumes into five primary classes of tissue in the human abdominal wall (skin, fat, muscle, connective tissue, and nontissue). This segmentation is achieved using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM), on a multiscale feature representation of the MRI volumes. We describe an automated method for utilizing FCM weights to produce a model that achieves 90 % agreement with manual segmentation. Two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) full-wave nonlinear ultrasound simulations are conducted, demonstrating the utility of realistic 3-D abdominal wall models over previously available 2-D abdominal wall models.

Data-driven calibration of wave-encoding point-spread function (PSF) was developed using a trained deep neural network. Data-driven reconstruction was developed with another set of neural networks based on the calibrated wave-encoding PSF. Training of the calibration and reconstruction networks was performed on 15,783 2D wave-encoded SSFSE abdominal images.Image quality of the proposed data-driven approach was compared independently and blindly with a conventional approach using iterative self-calibration and reconstruction with parallel imaging and compressed sensing by three radiologists on a scale from -2 to 2 for noise, contrast, sharpness, artifacts, and confidence. Computation time of these two approaches was also compared.Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare image quality and two-tailed t-tests were used to compare computation time with P values of under 0.05 considered statistically significant.An average 2.1-fold speedup in computation was achieved using the proposed method. The proposed data-driven self-calibration and reconstruction approach significantly reduced the perceived noise level (mean scores 0.82, P<0.0001).The proposed data-driven calibration and reconstruction achieved twice faster computation with reduced perceived noise, providing a fast and robust self-calibration and reconstruction for clinical abdominal SSFSE imaging.1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 1 J.

This temporal sharing results in respiratory motion within any phase to propagate artifacts across all shared phases. Compressed sensing (CS) eliminates the need for VS by recovering missing k-space data from pseudorandom undersampling, reducing temporal blurring while maintaining spatial resolution.PURPOSE: To evaluate a CS reconstruction algorithm on undersampled DCE-MRI data for image quality and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) detection.STUDY TYPE: Retrospective.SUBJECTS: Fifty consecutive patients undergoing MRI for screening (29 males, 21 phases with a complementary Poisson disc sampling pattern reconstructed with VS and CS algorithms.ASSESSMENT: VS and CS reconstructions evaluated by blinded assessments of image quality and anatomic delineation on Likert scales (1-4 and 1-5, respectively), and HCC detection by OPTN/UNOS criteria including a diagnostic confidence score (1-5). Blinded side-by-side reconstruction comparisons for lesion depiction and overall series preference (-3-3).STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank tests for paired nonparametric analyses with Bonferroni-Holm multiple-comparison corrections. McNemar's test for differences in lesion detection frequency and transplantation eligibility.RESULTS: CS compared with VS demonstrated significantly improved contrast (mean 3.6 vs. 2.9, P<0.0001) and less motion artifact (mean 3.6 vs. 3.2, P=0.006). CS compared with VS demonstrated significantly improved delineations of liver margin (mean 4.5 vs. 3.8, P=0.0002), portal veins (mean 4.5 vs. 3.7, P<0.0001), and hepatic veins (mean 4.6 vs. 3.5, P<0.0001), but significantly decreased delineation of hepatic arteries (mean 3.2 vs. 3.7, P=0.004). No significant differences were seen in the other assessments.DATA CONCLUSION: Applying a CS reconstruction to data acquired for a VS reconstruction significantly reduces motion artifacts in a clinical DCE protocol for HCC screening.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J.

A convex model with a locally low-rank constraint on the spatial-shot matrices is proposed. In vivo brain and breast experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.RESULTS: The proposed method shows significant benefits when the motion is severe, such as for breast imaging. Furthermore, the resulting images can be used for reliable phase estimation in the context of phase-estimation-based methods to achieve even higher image quality.CONCLUSION: We introduced the shot-locally low-rank method, a reconstruction technique for multishot diffusion-weighted MRI without explicit phase estimation.

While transthoracic echocardiography is widely accessible, it has limited reproducibility for grading inlet valve regurgitation. Multiplanar cardiac MRI is the quantitative standard but requires specialized local expertise, and is thus not widely available. Volumetric 4D flow MRI has potential for quantitatively grading the severity of inlet valve regurgitation in adult patients.To evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of volumetric 4D flow MRI for quantification of inlet valvular regurgitation compared to conventional multiplanar MRI, which may simplify and improve accessibility of cardiac MRI.This retrospective, HIPAA-compliant imaging-based comparison study was conducted at a single institution.Twenty-one patients who underwent concurrent multiplanar and 4D flow cardiac MRI between April 2015 and January 2017.3T; vs. indirect measurement), interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility of measurements of regurgitant flow volume (RFV), fraction (RF), and volume (RVol).Statistical analysis included Pearson correlation, Bland-Altman statistics, and intraclass correlation coefficients.There was high concordance between 4D flow and multiplanar MRI, whether using direct or indirect methods of quantifying regurgitation (r=0.813-0.985). Direct interrogation of the regurgitant jet with 4D flow showed high intraobserver consistency (r=0.976-0.999) and interobserver consistency (r=0.861-0.992), and correlated well with traditional indirect measurements obtained as the difference between stroke volume and forward outlet valve flow.4D flow MRI provides highly reproducible measurements of mitral and tricuspid regurgitant volume, and may be used in place of conventional multiplanar MRI.4 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J.

Twenty-nine patients (mean age, 43years; 11 male) were included in the study. Flow measurements were performed at three levels (valve, main artery and periphery) in both the pulmonary and systemic circulation by two independent readers and compared against stroke volumes from 4D flow anatomic data. Further, the shunt ratio (Qp/Qs) was calculated. Additionally, shunt volume was quantified at the atrial level by tracking the atrial septum.RESULTS: Measurements of the pulmonary blood flow at multiple levels correlate well whether measuring at the valve, main pulmonary artery or branch pulmonary arteries (r=0.885-0.886). Measurements of the systemic blood flow show excellent correlation, whether measuring at the valve, ascending aorta or sum of flow from the superior vena cava (SVC) and descending aorta (r=0.974-0.991). Intraclass agreement between the two observers for the flow measurements varies between 0.96 and 0.99. Compared with stroke volume, pulmonic flow is underestimated with 0.26l/min at the main pulmonary artery level, and systemic flow is overestimated with 0.16l/min at the ascending aorta level. Direct measurements of ASD flow are feasible in 20 of 29 (69%) patients.CONCLUSION: Blood flow and shunt quantification measured at multiple levels and performed by different readers are reproducible and consistent with 4D flow MRI.

WSS is the drag force-per-area the vessel endothelium exerts on luminal blood; abnormal levels of WSS are associated with cardiovascular pathologies. Previous methods for computing WSS are bottlenecked by labor-intensive manual segmentation of vessel boundaries. A rapid automated segmentation-free method for computing WSS is presented.Shear stress is the dot-product of the viscous stress tensor and the inward normal vector. The inward normal vectors are approximated as the gradient of fluid speed at every voxel. Subsequently, a 4D map of shear stress is computed as the partial derivatives of velocity with respect to the inward normal vectors. We highlight the shear stress near the wall by fusing visualization with edge-emphasized anatomical data.As a proof-of-concept, four cases with aortic pathologies are presented. Visualization allows for rapid localization of pathologic WSS. Subsequent analysis of these pathological regions enables quantification of WSS. Average WSS during peak systole measures approximately 50-60 cPa in nonpathological regions of the aorta and is elevated in regions of stenosis, coarctation, and dissection. WSS is reduced in regions of aneurysm.A volumetric technique for calculation and visualization of WSS from 4D Flow MRI data is presented. Traditional labor-intensive methods for WSS rely on explicit manual segmentation of vessel boundaries before visualization. This automated volumetric strategy for visualization and quantification of WSS may facilitate its clinical translation.

We assessed the performance of free-breathing conical UTE MRI in the evaluation of the pediatric pelvis for suspected appendicitis.METHODS: Our retrospective review of 84 pediatric patients who underwent MRI for suspected appendicitis compared three contrast-enhanced sequences: free-breathing conical high-resolution 3D SPGR (FB-SPGR). Two radiologists performed blinded and independent evaluations of each sequence for image quality (four point scale), anatomic delineation (four point scale), and diagnostic confidence (five point scale). Subsequently, the three sequences were directly compared for overall image quality (-3 to +3 scale). Scores were compared using Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.RESULTS: UTE demonstrated significantly better perceived signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and fewer artifacts than BH-SPGR and FB-SPGR (means of 3.6 and 3.4, 3.4 and 3.2, 3.1 and 2.7, respectively; p<0.0006).

Here, we report a pilot study evaluating patients with suspected cardiac amyloidosis for systemic extent of disease.METHODS: We prospectively enrolled nine patients, 61-86year old (meanSD 69.48.6), referred from the cardiac amyloid clinic. First, dynamic imaging of the heart was acquired immediately after injection of 222-318.2MBq (meanSD 270.133.3) of 18F-florbetaben using the GE SIGNA by a whole-body PET/MRI scan and axial T1-weighted imaging.RESULTS: High early uptake and delayed high uptake in the left ventricle correlated with amyloid deposition in five patients, while low uptake on early and delayed cardiac imaging was noted in four patients. Cardiac function measurements were successfully obtained in all participants. Areas of increased abnormal 18F-florbetaben accumulation were noted on delayed whole-body imaging in the bone marrow (seven patients), stomach (diffuse in five patients and focal in one patient), brain (five patients), salivary glands (three patients), tongue (three patients), spleen (three patients), skeletal muscles (three patients), ocular muscles (two patients), thyroid (two patients), pleura (two patients), kidneys (two patients), and lungs (two patients).CONCLUSIONS: Whole-body 18F-florbetaben PET/MRI is promising for localization of systemic amyloid deposition. This technique may provide important structural and functional information regarding the organs involved by disease, with potential to guide biopsy and evaluate response to treatment.TRIAL View details for [PubMedID 30043115](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30043115) Purpose To develop a deep learning reconstruction approach to improve the reconstruction speed and quality of highly undersampled variable-density single-shot fast spin-echo imaging by using a variational network (VN), and to clinically evaluate the feasibility of this approach. Materials and Methods Imaging was performed with a 3.0-T imager with a coronal variable-density single-shot fast spin-echo sequence at 3.25 times acceleration in 157 patients referred for abdominal imaging (mean age, 11 years; range, 1-34 years; 72 males [mean age, 10 years; 1-26 85 females [mean age, 12 years; range, 1-34 years]) between March 2016 and April 2017. A VN was trained based on the parallel imaging and compressed sensing (PICS) reconstruction of 130 patients. The remaining 27 patients were used for evaluation. Image quality was evaluated in an independent blinded fashion by three radiologists in terms of overall image quality, perceived signal-to-noise ratio, image contrast, sharpness, and residual artifacts with scores ranging from 1 (nondiagnostic) to 5 (excellent). Wilcoxon tests were performed to test the hypothesis that there was no significant difference between VN and PICS. Results VN achieved improved perceived signal-to-noise ratio (P = .01) and improved sharpness (P < .001), with no difference in image contrast (P = .24) and residual artifacts (P = .07). In terms of overall image quality, VN performed better than did PICS (P = .02). Average reconstruction time standard deviation was 5.60 seconds 1.30 per section for PICS and 0.19 second 0.04 per section for VN. Conclusion Compared with the conventional parallel imaging and compressed sensing reconstruction (PICS), the variational network (VN) approach accelerates the reconstruction of variable-density single-shot fast spin-echo sequences and achieves improved overall image quality with higher perceived signal-to-noise ratio and sharpness.

However, hypotension has been reported with the use of ferumoxytol for indications other than cardiac MRI. The purpose of our investigation was to evaluate the safety of ferumoxytol in children undergoing general anaesthesia for cardiac MRI.METHODS: Medical records of children undergoing general anaesthesia for cardiac MRI were reviewed. Baseline demographic and medical characteristics, as well as imaging and anaesthetic duration and technique, were collected. The incidence of hypotension or other adverse events', need for vasoactive support, or airway intervention throughout the anaesthetic, was recorded.RESULTS: A total of 95 patients were identified, 61 received ferumoxytol and 34 received gadolinium. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to age, weight, or baseline blood pressure. The incidence of low blood pressure - systolic or mean - after contrast administration did not differ between groups, and there was no difference in sustained hypotension or use of vasopressors between groups. One patient who received ferumoxytol had possible anaphylaxis. The image acquisition time (45 versus 68 min, p=0.002) and anaesthesia duration (100 versus 132 min, p=0.02) were shorter in the ferumoxytol group.CONCLUSION: Transient low blood pressure was common in children undergoing cardiac MRI with anaesthesia, but the incidence of hypotension did not differ between ferumoxytol and gadolinium groups. The use of ferumoxytol was associated with significantly shorter scan time and anaesthesia duration, as well as a decreased need for airway intervention.

This work also proposes a scan averaging technique that is superior to magnitude averaging and is not subject to artifacts due to object phase.This single-shot sequence is robust against violation of the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) condition. This is achieved by dephasing the signal after diffusion weighting and tipping the MG component of the signal onto the longitudinal axis while the non-MG component is spoiled. The MG signal component is then excited and captured using a traditional SS-FSE sequence, although the echo needs to be recalled prior to each echo. Extended Parallel Imaging (ExtPI) averaging is used where coil sensitivities from the multiple acquisitions are concatenated into one large parallel imaging (PI) problem. The size of the PI problem is reduced by SVD-based coil compression which also provides background noise suppression. This sequence and reconstruction are evaluated in simulation, phantom scans, and in vivo abdominal clinical cases.Simulations show that the sequence generates a stable signal throughout the echo train which leads to good image quality. This sequence is inherently low-SNR, but much of the SNR can be regained through scan averaging and the proposed ExtPI reconstruction. In vivo results show that the proposed method is able to provide diffusion encoded images while mitigating geometric distortion artifacts compared to EPI.This work presents a diffusion-prepared SS-FSE sequence that is robust against the violation of the CPMG condition while providing diffusion contrast in clinical cases.

The average ratio of scan time between these two approaches was also compared.A Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with a P value under 0.05 considered statistically significant.Wave-encoded variable-density SSFSE significantly reduced the perceived noise level and improved the sharpness of the abdominal wall and the kidneys compared with standard acquisition (mean scores 0.8, 1.2, and 0.8, respectively, P < 0.003). No significant difference was observed in relation to other features (P = 0.11). An average of 21% decrease in scan time was achieved using the proposed method.Wave-encoded variable-density sampling SSFSE achieves improved image quality with clinically relevant echo time and reduced scan time, thus providing a fast and robust approach for clinical SSFSE imaging.1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 6 J.

A random forest classifier was trained to further segment the renal tissue into cortex, medulla, and the collecting system. The algorithm was tested on 26 subjects and the segmentation results were compared to the manually drawn segmentation maps using the F1-score metric. A two-compartment model was used to estimate the GFR of each subject using both automatically and manually generated segmentation maps.Segmentation maps generated automatically showed high similarity to the manually drawn maps for the whole-kidney (F1=0.93) and renal cortex (F1=0.86). GFR estimations using whole-kidney from the method were highly correlated (Spearman's =0.99) to the GFR values obtained from manual maps. The mean GFR estimation error of the automatic method was 2.980.66% with an average segmentation time of 45 s per patient.The automatic segmentation method performs as well as the manual segmentation for GFR estimation and reduces the segmentation time from several hours to 45 s.

We hypothesized that blood flow might correlate with fibroid volume and that quantifying blood flow might help to predict the amount of embolic required to achieve stasis at subsequent uterine fibroid embolization (UFE).Thirty-three patients with uterine fibroids and seven control subjects underwent pelvic MRI with 4D flow imaging. Of the patients with fibroids, 10 underwent 4D flow imaging before UFE and seven after UFE; in the remaining 16 patients with fibroids, UFE had yet to be performed. Four-dimensional flow measurements were performed using Arterys CV Flow. The flow fraction of the internal iliac artery was expressed as the ratio of internal iliac artery flow to external iliac artery flow and was compared between groups. The flow ratios between the internal iliac arteries on each side were calculated. Fibroid volume versus internal iliac flow fraction, embolic volume versus internal iliac flow fraction, and embolic volume ratio between sides versus the ratio of internal iliac artery flows between sides were compared.The mean internal iliac flow fraction was significantly higher in the 26 patients who underwent imaging before UFE (mean standard error, 0.78 0.06) than in the seven patients who underwent imaging after UFE (0.48 0.07, p < 0.01) and in the seven control patients without fibroids (0.48 0.08, p < 0.0001). The internal iliac flow fraction correlated well with fibroid volumes before UFE (r = 0.7754, p < 0.0001) and did not correlate with fibroid volumes after UFE (r = -0.3051, p = 0.51). The ratio of embolic required to achieve stasis between sides showed a modest correlation with the ratio of internal iliac flow (r = 0.6776, p = 0.03).Internal iliac flow measured by 4D flow MRI correlates with fibroid volume and is predictive of the ratio of embolic required to achieve stasis on each side at subsequent UFE and may be useful for preprocedural evaluation of patients with uterine fibroids.

A non-Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (nCPMG) SS-FSE acquisition stabilizes both the main and parasitic echo families for each echo. This preserves both the in-phase and quadrature components of the magnetization throughout the echo train. However, nCPMG SS-FSE also promotes aliasing of the quadrature component, which complicates reconstruction. A new acquisition and reconstruction approach is presented here, where the field-of-view is effectively doubled, but a partial k-space and variable density sampling is used to improve scan efficiency. The technique is presented in phantom scans to validate SNR and robustness against rapidly varying object phase. In vivo healthy volunteer examples and the clinical cases are demonstrated in abdominal imaging. This new approach provides comparable SNR to previous nCPMG acquisition techniques as well as providing more uniform apparent diffusion coefficient maps in phantom scans. In vivo scans suggest that this method is more robust against motion than previous approaches. The proposed reconstruction is an improvement to the nCPMG sequence as it is auto-calibrating and is justified to accurately treat the signal model for the nCPMG SS-FSE sequence.

The ideal imaging modality provides excellent vascular visualization without incurring added risks, such as radiation exposure. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRA using a high-resolution 3D volumetric sequence (fe-SPGR) for visualizing and grading pediatric brain AVMs in comparison with CTA and DSA, which is the current imaging gold standard. METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, 21 patients with AVMs evaluated by fe-SPGR, CTA, and DSA between April 2014 and August 2017 were included. Two experienced raters graded AVMs using Spetzler-Martin criteria on all imaging studies. Lesion conspicuity (LC) and diagnostic confidence (DC) were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale, and interrater agreement was determined. The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to assess the raters' grades and scores of LC and DC, with subsequent post hoc pairwise comparisons to assess for statistically significant differences between pairs of groups at p < 0.05. RESULTS Assigned Spetzler-Martin grades for AVMs on DSA, fe-SPGR, and CTA were not significantly different (p = 0.991). LC and DC scores were higher with fe-SPGR than with CTA (p < 0.05). A significant difference in LC scores was found between CTA and fe-SPGR (p < 0.001) and CTA and DSA (p < 0.001) but not between fe-SPGR and DSA (p = 0.146). A significant difference in DC scores was found among DSA, fe-SPGR, and CTA (p < 0.001) and between all pairs of the groups (p < 0.05). Interrater agreement was good to very good for all image groups ( = 0.77-1.0, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Fe-SPGR performed robustly in the diagnostic evaluation of brain AVMs, with improved visual depiction of AVMs compared with CTA and comparable Spetzler-Martin grading relative to CTA and DSA.

Five radiologists independently scored 138 lesions on native high b-value images (b=1200s/mm2), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and computed high b-value images (contrast equivalent to b=2000 s/mm2) to compare their diagnostic accuracy. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and McNemar's test were performed to assess the relative performance of computed high b value DWI, native high b-value DWI and ADC maps. No significant difference existed in the area under the curve (AUC) for ROCs comparing B1200 (b=1200s/mm2) to computed B2000 (c-B2000) in 5 readers. In 4 of 5 readers c-B2000 had significantly increased sensitivity and/or decreased specificity compared to B1200 (McNemar's p<0.05), at selected thresholds of interpretation. ADC maps were less accurate than B1200 or c-B2000 for 2 of 5 readers (P<0.05). This study detected no consistent improvement in overall diagnostic accuracy using c-B2000, compared with B1200 images. Readers detected more cancer with c-B2000 images (increased sensitivity) but also more false positive findings (decreased specificity).

Since battery power would limit scan time, wireless power transfer (WPT) is a viable option to continuously supply several watts of power to on-coil electronics. To minimize added noise and decouple the wireless power system from MRI coils, restrictions are placed on the coil geometry of the wireless power system, which are shown to limit its efficiency. Continuous power harvesting can also cause a large increase in the background noise of the image due to diode rectifier up-conversion of noise around the frequency of the transmitted power. However, by RF gating the transmitted power off during the MRI receive time while continuing to supply power from a storage capacitor, WPT is demonstrated to have minimal impact on image quality at received power levels up to 11 W. The integration of WPT with a 1.5T scanner is demonstrated.

When both systems are assessed currently, multiple modalities are utilized in costly fashion with burdensome logistics and decreased accessibility. Thus, we have developed a new acquisition and reconstruction paradigm using the flexibility of MRI to enable a comprehensive exam from a single 5-15 min scan. We constructed a compressive-sensing approach to pseudo-randomly acquire highly subsampled, multi-dimensionally-encoded and time-stamped data from which we reconstruct volumetric cardiac and respiratory motion phases, contrast-agent dynamics, and blood flow velocity fields. The proposed method, named XD flow, is demonstrated for (a) evaluating congenital heart disease, where the impact of bulk motion is reduced in a non-sedated neonatal patient and (b) where the observation of the impact of respiration on flow is necessary for diagnostics; (c) cardiopulmonary imaging, where cardiovascular flow, function, and anatomy information is needed along with pulmonary perfusion quantification; and in (d) renal function imaging, where blood velocities and glomerular filtration rates are simultaneously measured, which highlights the generality of the technique. XD flow has the ability to improve quantification and to provide additional data for patient diagnosis for comprehensive evaluations.

With Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, 28 consecutive children referred for 3T knee MRI prospectively underwent a standard clinical knee protocol followed by T2 Sh. T2 Sh performance was assessed by two readers blinded to diagnostic reports. Interpretive discrepancies were resolved by medical record chart review and consensus between the readers and an orthopedic surgeon. Image quality was evaluated by rating anatomic delineation, with 95% confidence interval. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test assessed the null hypothesis that T2 Sh structure delineation compared to conventional 2D is unchanged. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated for interobserver agreement. Imaging time of the conventional protocol and T2 Sh was compared.There was 81% and 87% concordance between T2 Sh reports and diagnostic reports, respectively, for each reader. Upon consensus review, T2 Sh had 93% sensitivity and 100% specificity compared to clinical reports for detection of clinically relevant findings. The 95% confidence interval of diagnostic or better rating was 95-100%, with 34-80% interobserver agreement. There was no significant difference in structure delineation between T2 Sh and 2D, except for the retinaculum (P < 0.05), where 2D was preferred. Typical imaging time for T2 Sh and the conventional exam was 7 and 13 minutes, respectively.A single-sequence pediatric knee exam is feasible with T2 Sh, providing multiplanar, reformattable 4D images.

Subsegmental PA visualization was possible in >93% scans for all techniques (P = 0.27). Interobserver agreement was excellent for combined scores (ICC = 0.83).High-quality free-breathing conical UTE chest MR is feasible, surpassing 4D flow for lungs and airways, with equivalent PA visualization.

Medical records were reviewed for indication, any complications, if further diagnostic imaging was performed after MRI, and surgical findings. Two radiologists scored the images in two sessions on a 5-point scale for overall image quality and delineation of various anatomical structures. Confidence interval of proportions for likelihood of requiring additional diagnostic imaging after MRI was determined. For the possibility of reducing the protocol to a single rapid sequence, Wilcoxon-rank sum test was used to assess whether 4D flow and MRA significantly differed in anatomical delineation.One of 21 patients (4.8%, 80% confidence interval 0-11%) required additional imaging, a computed tomography angiography to assess lung parenchyma and peripheral pulmonary arteries. Only 1 of 13 patients (7.7%) with operative confirmation had a minor discrepancy between radiology and operative reports (80% confidence interval 0-17%). 4D flow was significantly superior to MRA (P<0.05) for the evaluation of systemic arteries, valves, ventricular trabeculae, and overall quality. Using Cohen's kappa coefficient, there was good interobserver agreement for the evaluation of systemic arteries by 4D flow (=0.782), and systemic veins and pulmonary arteries by MRA (>0.6). Overall 4D flow measurements (mean =0.64-0.74) had better internal agreement compared with MRA (mean =0.30-0.64).Ferumoxytol-enhanced cardiac MRI, without anesthesia, is feasible for the evaluation of complex CHD in neonates and young infants, with a low likelihood of need for additional diagnostic studies. The decreased risk by avoiding anesthesia must be balanced against the potential for adverse reactions with ferumoxytol.2 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2016.

In this work, a binary quadratic optimization program was formulated to resolve the phase ambiguity. A projected power method was developed to efficiently solve the optimization problem. Both the 1-peak fat model and 6-peak fat model were applied to three-dimensional (3D) datasets. Additionally, the proposed method was extended to dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications using the 6-peak fat model. With institutional review board (IRB) approval and patient consent/assent, the proposed method was evaluated and compared with region growing on 29 consecutive 3D high-resolution patient datasets.Fast and robust water/fat separation was achieved by the proposed method in different representative 3D datasets and dynamic 3D datasets. Superior water/fat separation was achieved using the 6-peak fat model compared with the 1-peak fat model. Compared to region growing, the proposed method reduced water/fat swaps from 76 to 7% of the patient cohort.The proposed method can achieve fast and robust phase error estimation in dual-echo Dixon imaging.

These schemes were used for two-point Dixon-based dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) of the breast and abdomen. Results were validated in vivo with a novel approach using variable-flip-angle data, which was retrospectively accelerated using the same methods but offered a ground truth.In breast DCE-MRI, the temporal footprint could be reduced 2.3-fold retrospectively without introducing noticeable artifacts, improving depiction of rapidly enhancing lesions. Further, experiments with variable-flip-angle data showed that reducing view sharing improved accuracy in reconstruction and T1 mapping. In abdominal MRI, 2.3-fold and 3.6-fold reductions in temporal footprint allowed reduced motion artifacts.The complementary-Poisson-disc k-space sampling trajectory allowed a retrospective spatiotemporal resolution tradeoff using CS and view sharing, imparting robustness to motion and contrast enhancement.

Compared with standard gadolinium-based contrast agents, ferumoxytol (Feraheme, AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Waltham, MA), used as an alternative contrast medium, is feasible in patients with impaired renal function. Other attractive imaging features of i.v. ferumoxytol include a prolonged blood pool phaseand delayed intracellular uptake. With its unique pharmacologic, metabolic, and imaging properties, ferumoxytol may play a crucial role in future magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system, various organs outside the central nervous system, and the cardiovascular system. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the overall safety and effectiveness of this novel contrast agent, with rarely occurring anaphylactoid reactions. The purpose of this review is to describe the general and organ-specific properties of ferumoxytol, as well as the advantages and potential pitfalls associated with its use in magnetic resonance imaging.

US is time intensive, operator dependent, and results in frequent inconclusive studies, thus necessitating further imaging, and admission for observation or repeat clinical visits. A rapid focused Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for appendicitis has been shown to have definitive sensitivity and specificity, similar to Computed tomography (CT) but without radiation and offers a potential alternative to US.In this single-center prospective cohort study, we sought to determine the difference in total length of stay and charges between rapid MRI and US as the initial imaging modality in pediatric and young adult patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with suspected appendicitis. We hypothesized that rapid MRI would be more efficient and cost effective than US as the initial imaging modality in the ED diagnosis of appendicitis.A prospective randomized cohort study of consecutive patients was conducted in patients 2-30 years of age in an academic ED with access to both rapid MRI and US imaging modalities 24/7. Prior to the start of the study, the days of the week were randomized to either rapid MRI or US as the initial imaging modality. Physicians evaluated patients with suspected appendicitis per their usual manner. If the physician decided to obtain radiologic imaging, the pre-determined imaging modality for the day of the week was used. All decisions regarding other diagnostic testing and/or further imaging were left to the physician's discretion. Time intervals (min) between triage, order placement, start of imaging, end of imaging, image result and disposition (discharge vs. admission), as well as total charges (diagnostic testing, imaging and repeat ED visits) were recorded.Over a 100-day period, 82 patients were imaged to evaluate for appendicitis; 45/82 (55%) of patients were in the US first group; and 37/82 (45%) patients were in the rapid MRI first group. There were no differences in patient demographics or clinical characteristics between the groups and no cases of missed appendicitis in either group. 11/45 (24%) of US first patients had inconclusive studies, resulting in follow-up rapid MRI and 5 return ED visits contrasted with no inconclusive studies or return visits (p< 0.05) in the rapid MRI group. The rapid MRI compared to US group was associated with longer ED length of stay (mean difference 100 min; 95% CI 35-169) and increased ED charges (mean difference $4,887; 95% CI $1,821 - $8,513).In the diagnosis of appendicitis, US first imaging is more time efficient and less costly than rapid MRI despite inconclusive studies after US imaging. Unless the process of obtaining a rapid MRI becomes more efficient and less expensive, US should be the first line imaging modality for appendicitis in patients 2-30 years of age.

Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. vrfSSFSE and conventional SSFSE sagittal and coronal oblique acquisitions were performed in 54 consecutive female patients referred for 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) evaluation of known or suspected uterine leiomyomas. Two radiologists who were blinded to the image acquisition technique semiquantitatively scored images on a scale from -2 to 2 for noise, image contrast, sharpness, artifacts, and perceived ability to evaluate uterine, ovarian, and musculoskeletal structures. The null hypothesis of no significant difference between pulse sequences was assessed with a Wilcoxon signed rank test by using a Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Results Because of reductions in specific absorption rate, vrfSSFSE imaging demonstrated significantly increased speed (more than twofold, P < .0001), with mean repetition times compared with conventional SSFSE imaging decreasing from 1358 to 613 msec for sagittal acquisitions and from 1494 to 621 msec for coronal oblique acquisitions. Almost all assessed image quality and perceived diagnostic capability parameters were significantly improved with vrfSSFSE imaging. These improvements included noise, sharpness, and ability to evaluate the junctional zone, myometrium, and musculoskeletal structures for both sagittal acquisitions (mean values of 0.56, 0.63, 0.42, 0.56, and 0.80, respectively; all P values < .0001) and coronal oblique acquisitions (mean values of 0.81, 1.09, 0.65, 0.93, and 1.12, respectively; all P values < .0001). For evaluation of artifacts, there was an insufficient number of cases with differences to allow statistical testing. Conclusion Compared with conventional SSFSE acquisition, vrfSSFSE acquisition increases 3-T imaging speed via reduced specific absorption rate and leads to significant improvements in perceived image quality and perceived diagnostic capability when evaluating pelvic structures.

Unlike EPI, SS-FSE is ill-suited to diffusion weighted (DWI) due to the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Geill (CPMG) condition. Non- CPMG phase cycling does accommodate SS-FSE and DWI but places constraints on reconstruction, which are resolved here through parallel imaging. Additionally, improved echo stability can be achieved by using short duration and highly selective DIVERSE radiofrequency pulses. Here, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) comparisons between EPI and nCPMG SS-FSE acquisitions and reconstruction techniques give similar values. Diffusion imaging with nCPMG SS-FSE gives similar SNR to an EPI acquisition, though apparent diffusion coefficient values are higher than seen with EPI. In vivo images have good image quality with little distortion. This method has the ability to capture distortionfree DWI images near areas of significant off-resonance as well as preserve adequate SNR. Parallel imaging and DIVERSE refocusing RF pulses allow shorter ETL compared to previous implementations and thus reduces phase encode direction blur and SAR accumulation.

PET/CT and PET/MRI images were evaluated by two readers independently for areas of FDG uptake compatible with malignancy, and then categorized into 5 groups (1: PET/MRI and PET/CT positive; 2: PET/MRI positive, PET/CT PET/CT negative; 5: PET/MRI negative, PET/CT positive) by consensus. Patients with no lesions on either study or greater than 10 lesions based on either modality were excluded from the study.Fifty-two patients (meanSD age: 5814 years) underwent the dual imaging protocol; of these, 29 patients with a total of 93 FDG-avid lesions met the inclusion criteria. The majority of lesions (56%) were recorded prospectively in the same location on PET/CT and PET/MRI. About an equal small fraction of lesions were seen on PET/CT but only retrospectively on PET/MRI (9%) and vice versa (12%). More lesions were identified only on PET/MRI but not on PET/CT, even in retrospect (96% vs. 81%, respectively; p = 0.003). Discrepant lesions had lower maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) than concordant lesions on both modalities (p<0.001).While most lesions were identified prospectively on both modalities, significantly more lesions were identified with PET/MRI than with PET/CT.

Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were measured, and four blinded radiologists assessed overall image quality. Differences in repetition time and CNR were assessed using a paired Student's t test with p<0.05 considered statistically significant. Inter-reader variability was assessed with Fleiss' kappa statistic.53 eligible lesions in 27 patients were included for analysis. vrfSSFSE demonstrated higher mean lesion CNR compared to SSFSE 6.74.1, time (TR) was the vrfSSFSE sequence compared to 1139106ms for SSFSE (p<0.0001), corresponding to a 1.7-fold decrease in acquisition time. Overall quality of liver lesion and common bile duct images with the vrfSSFSE sequence was graded as superior than or equivalent to the SSFSE sequence for 59% and 67% of patients, respectively.Compared to conventional SSFSE, vrfSSFSE resulted in improved lesion contrast on simultaneous PET/MRI in patients with liver metastases. Due to decreased SAR demands, vrfSSFSE significantly decreased TR, allowing coverage of the entire liver in a single twenty-second breath hold. This may have important clinical implications in the setting of PET/MRI, where scan time is limited by the necessity of whole-body image acquisition in addition to bed specific imaging.

GRPr proteins are highly overexpressed in several human tumors, including prostate cancer. We present data from the use of 68Ga-RM2 in patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer (PC) and negative conventional imaging (CI). Methods: We enrolled 32 men with BCR PC, 59-83 year-old positron emission tomography (PET) magnetic scanner. T1-weighted (T1w), T2-weighted (T2w) and diffusion-weighted images (DWI) were acquired. Results: All patients had rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) (range: 0.3-119.0 ng/mL; meanSD: 10.1 21.3) and negative CI (CT or MRI, and 99mTc MDP bone scan) prior to enrollment. The observed 68Ga-RM2 PET detection rate was 71.8%. 68Ga-RM2 PET identified recurrent prostate cancer in 23 of the 32 participants, while the simultaneous MRI scan identified findings compatible with recurrent prostate cancer in 11 of the 32 patients. PSA velocity (PSAv) values were 0.320.59 ng/ml/year (range: 0.04-1.9) in PET scans and 2.512.16 ng/ml/year (range: 0.13-8.68) in patients with positive PET scans (P: 0.006). Conclusion:68Ga-RM2 PET can be used for assessment of GRPr expression in patients with BCR PC. High uptake in multiple areas compatible with cancer lesions suggests that 68Ga-RM2 is a promising PET radiopharmaceutical for localization of disease in participants with BCR PC and negative CI.

Image quality and performance of each sequence, and combination of all three sequences, was evaluated with respect to PET-CT.Lesion conspicuity was best on cDWI, while delineation was best on CE. Considering all three sequences combined, both readers showed good sensitivity and specificity (>80%). Relative sensitivity was highest on CE and lowest on T2w.Whole-body MR performed well in detecting malignant lesions compared to PET-CT. CE showed overall highest performance.

Several excitations with the same multiband pattern progressively shifted in the phase-encode direction were used to cover the prescribed field of view (FOV). The phase-encoded FOV was limited to the width of a single band to reduce off-resonance-induced distortion and blurring. Parallel imaging (PI) techniques were used to resolve aliasing from the other bands and to combine the different excitations. Following validation in phantoms and healthy volunteers, a preliminary study in breast cancer patients (N=14) was performed to compare the proposed method to conventional DWI with PI and to reduced-FOV DWI.The proposed method gave high-resolution diffusion-weighted images with minimal artifacts at the band intersections. Compared to PI alone, higher phase-encoded FOV-reduction factors and reduced noise amplification were obtained, which translated to higher resolution images than conventional (non-multiband) DWI. The same resolution and image quality achievable over targeted regions using existing reduced-FOV methods was obtained, but the proposed method also enables complete bilateral coverage.We developed an in-plane multiband technique for high-resolution DWI and compared its performance with other standard DWI methods.

The proposed method was tested on six subjects and image quality was compared with standard accelerated Cartesian acquisition both with and without respiratory triggering. Inverse gradient entropy and normalized gradient squared metrics were calculated, testing whether image quality was improved using paired t-tests.For respiratory-triggered scans, wave-encoding significantly reduced residual aliasing and blurring compared with standard Cartesian acquisition (metrics suggesting P<0.05). For non-respiratory-triggered scans, the proposed method yielded significantly better motion correction compared with standard motion-corrected Cartesian acquisition (metrics suggesting P<0.01).The proposed methods can reduce motion artifacts and improve overall image quality of highly accelerated free-breathing abdominal MRI.

Conventionally, Q-spoiling is performed using a PIN diode switch that draws significant current. In this work, a Q-spoiling technique using a depletion-mode Gallium Nitride HEMT device was developed for coil detuning at both 1.5 T and 3 T MRI. The circuits with conventional PIN diode Q-spoiling and the GaN HEMT device were implemented on surface coils. SNR was measured and compared for all surfaces coils. At both 1.5 T and 3 T, comparable SNR was achieved for all coils with the proposed technique and conventional Q-spoiling. The GaN HEMT device has significantly reduced the required power for Q-spoiling. The GaN HEMT device also provides useful safety features by detuning the coil when unpowered.

Unlike EPI, SS-FSE is ill-suited to diffusion weighted (DWI) due to the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Geill (CPMG) condition. Non- CPMG phase cycling does accommodate SS-FSE and DWI but places constraints on reconstruction, which are resolved here through parallel imaging. Additionally, improved echo stability can be achieved by using short duration and highly selective DIVERSE radiofrequency pulses. Here, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) comparisons between EPI and nCPMG SS-FSE acquisitions and reconstruction techniques give similar values. Diffusion imaging with nCPMG SS-FSE gives similar SNR to an EPI acquisition, though apparent diffusion coefficient values are higher than seen with EPI. In vivo images have good image quality with little distortion. This method has the ability to capture distortionfree DWI images near areas of significant off-resonance as well as preserve adequate SNR. Parallel imaging and DIVERSE refocusing RF pulses allow shorter ETL compared to previous implementations and thus reduces phase encode direction blur and SAR accumulation.

With Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, 28 consecutive children referred for 3T knee MRI prospectively underwent a standard clinical knee protocol followed by T2 Sh. T2 Sh performance was assessed by two readers blinded to diagnostic reports. Interpretive discrepancies were resolved by medical record chart review and consensus between the readers and an orthopedic surgeon. Image quality was evaluated by rating anatomic delineation, with 95% confidence interval. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test assessed the null hypothesis that T2 Sh structure delineation compared to conventional 2D is unchanged. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated for interobserver agreement. Imaging time of the conventional protocol and T2 Sh was compared.There was 81% and 87% concordance between T2 Sh reports and diagnostic reports, respectively, for each reader. Upon consensus review, T2 Sh had 93% sensitivity and 100% specificity compared to clinical reports for detection of clinically relevant findings. The 95% confidence interval of diagnostic or better rating was 95-100%, with 34-80% interobserver agreement. There was no significant difference in structure delineation between T2 Sh and 2D, except for the retinaculum (P < 0.05), where 2D was preferred. Typical imaging time for T2 Sh and the conventional exam was 7 and 13 minutes, respectively.A single-sequence pediatric knee exam is feasible with T2 Sh, providing multiplanar, reformattable 4D images.

The 4D flow and planar (2D) phase-contrast (PC) were acquired during same scanning session, but 4D flow was scanned after injection of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. Eddy-currents were semi-automatically corrected using the web-based software. Flow over pulmonary valve was measured and the 4D flow values were compared against the 2D PC ones.The mean forward flow was 92 (30) ml/cycle measured with 4D flow and 86 (29) ml/cycle measured with 2D PC, with a correlation of 0.82 and a mean difference of -6ml/cycle (-41-29). For the regurgitant fraction the correlation was 0.85 with a mean difference of -0.95% (-17-15). Mean peak systolic velocity measured with 4D flow was 92 (49) cm/s and 108 (56) cm/s with 2D PC, having a correlation of 0.93 and a mean difference of 16cm/s (-24-55).4D flow imaging post-processed with an integrated cloud-based application accurately quantifies pulmonary flow. However, it may underestimate the peak systolic velocity.

Medical records were reviewed for indication, any complications, if further diagnostic imaging was performed after MRI, and surgical findings. Two radiologists scored the images in two sessions on a 5-point scale for overall image quality and delineation of various anatomical structures. Confidence interval of proportions for likelihood of requiring additional diagnostic imaging after MRI was determined. For the possibility of reducing the protocol to a single rapid sequence, Wilcoxon-rank sum test was used to assess whether 4D flow and MRA significantly differed in anatomical delineation.One of 21 patients (4.8%, 80% confidence interval 0-11%) required additional imaging, a computed tomography angiography to assess lung parenchyma and peripheral pulmonary arteries. Only 1 of 13 patients (7.7%) with operative confirmation had a minor discrepancy between radiology and operative reports (80% confidence interval 0-17%). 4D flow was significantly superior to MRA (P<0.05) for the evaluation of systemic arteries, valves, ventricular trabeculae, and overall quality. Using Cohen's kappa coefficient, there was good interobserver agreement for the evaluation of systemic arteries by 4D flow (=0.782), and systemic veins and pulmonary arteries by MRA (>0.6). Overall 4D flow measurements (mean =0.64-0.74) had better internal agreement compared with MRA (mean =0.30-0.64).Ferumoxytol-enhanced cardiac MRI, without anesthesia, is feasible for the evaluation of complex CHD in neonates and young infants, with a low likelihood of need for additional diagnostic studies.

US is less sensitive and specific than computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, which are often performed after nondiagnostic US.We sought to determine predictors of nondiagnostic US in order to guide efficient ordering of imaging studies.A prospective cohort study of consecutive patients 4 to 30years of age with suspected appendicitis took place at an emergency department with access to 24/7 US, MRI, and CT capabilities. Patients with US as their initial study were identified. Clinical (i.e., duration of illness, highest fever, and right lower quadrant pain) and demographic (i.e., age and sex) variables were collected. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria; BMI >85th percentile was categorized as overweight. Patients were followed until day 7. Univariate and stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed.Over 3months, 106 patients had US first for suspected appendicitis; 52 (49%) had nondiagnostic US results. Eighteen patients had appendicitis, and there were no missed cases after discharge. On univariate analysis, male sex, a yearly increase in age, and overweight BMI were associated with nondiagnostic US (p<0.05). In the multivariate model, only BMI (odds ratio 4.9 [95% CI 2.0-12.2]) and age (odds ratio 1.1 [95% CI 1.02-1.20]) were predictors. Sixty-eight percent of nondiagnostic US results occurred in overweight patients.Overweight and older patients are more likely to have a nondiagnostic US or appendicitis, and it may be more efficient to consider alternatives to US first for these patients. Also, this information about the accuracy of US to diagnose suspected appendicitis may be useful to clinicians who wish to engage in shared decision-making with the parents or guardians of children regarding imaging options for children with acute abdominal pain.

The designed flexible coil can easily conform to different patient sizes with nonoverlapping coil elements in the transverse plane. It can cover a field of view of up to 44 28 cm(2) and removes the need for coil repositioning for body MRI patients with multiple clinical concerns. The 64-channel coil was compared with a 32-channel standard coil for signal-to-noise ratio and parallel imaging performances on different phantoms. With IRB approval and informed consent/assent, the designed coil was validated on 21 consecutive pediatric patients.The pediatric coil provided higher signal-to-noise ratio than the standard coil on different phantoms, with the averaged signal-to-noise ratio gain at least 23% over a depth of 7 cm along the cross-section of phantoms. It also achieved better parallel imaging performance under moderate acceleration factors. Good image quality (average score 4.6 out of 5) was achieved using the developed pediatric coil in the clinical studies.A 64-channel semiflexible receive-only phased array has been developed and validated to facilitate high quality pediatric body MRI at 3T.

Complete ventricular coverage with standard 2D short-axis cine SSFP and whole chest coverage with axial 4D flow were obtained. Two blinded radiologists independently segmented images for left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) myocardium at end systole (ES) and end diastole (ED). Statistical analysis included linear regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA), Bland-Altman (BA) analysis, and intraclass correlation (ICC).Significant positive were found between 4D flow and SSFP for ventricular volumes (r=0.808-0.972, P < 0.001), ejection fraction (EF) (r=0.900-928, P < 0.001), and mass (r=0.884-0.934, P < 0.001). BA relative limits of agreement for both ventricles were between -52% to 34% for volumes, -29% to 27% for EF, and -41% to 48% for mass, with wider limits of agreement for the RV compared to the LV. There was no significant difference between techniques with respect to mean square difference of ED-ES mass for either LV (F=2.05, P=0.159) or RV (F=0.625, P=0.434). Interobserver agreement was moderate to good with both 4D flow (ICC 0.523-0.993) and SSFP (ICC 0.619-0.982), with overlapping confidence intervals.Quantification of ventricular volume, function, and mass can be accomplished with 4D flow MRI with precision and interobserver agreement comparable to that of cine SSFP.

With dense coil arrays, individual coil elements can provide localized motion estimates. An averaged motion estimate over all coils is often used for motion compensation. However, this motion estimate may not accurately represent the dominant motion within the imaging volume. In this work, a coil clustering method is proposed to automatically determine the dominant motion for dense coil arrays. The feasibility of the proposed method is investigated in free-breathing abdominal MRI and cardiac MRI, and compared with manual motion estimate selection for respiratory motion estimation and electrocardiography for cardiac motion estimation.Automated motion estimation achieved similar respiratory motion estimation compared to manual selection (averaged correlation coefficient 0.989 and 0.988 for abdominal MRI and cardiac MRI, respectively), and accurate cardiac triggering compared to electrocardiography (averaged temporal variability 17.5 ms).The proposed method can provide accurate automated motion estimation for body MRI using dense coil arrays.

Four compressed-sensing methods were developed: A) VDPoisson scan reconstructed using spatial wavelets; B) added temporal total variation to A; C) VDRad scan using the same reconstruction as in B; and D) added motion compensation to C.

These readers performed a paired wall motion and functional assessment between method D and 2D balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) CINE for 16 cases.Method D had higher diagnostic image quality for most anatomical features (mean 3.8-4.8) compared to A (2.0-3.6), B (2.2-3.7), and C (2.9-3.9) with P < 0.05 with good interobserver agreement ( 0.49).

In this work, a binary quadratic optimization program was formulated to resolve the phase ambiguity. A projected power method was developed to efficiently solve the optimization problem. Both the 1-peak fat model and 6-peak fat model were applied to three-dimensional (3D) datasets. Additionally, the proposed method was extended to dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications using the 6-peak fat model. With institutional review board (IRB) approval and patient consent/assent, the proposed method was evaluated and compared with region growing on 29 consecutive 3D high-resolution patient datasets.Fast and robust water/fat separation was achieved by the proposed method in different representative 3D datasets and dynamic 3D datasets. Superior water/fat separation was achieved using the 6-peak fat model compared with the 1-peak fat model. Compared to region growing, the proposed method reduced water/fat swaps from 76 to 7% of the patient cohort.The proposed method can achieve fast and robust phase error estimation in dual-echo Dixon imaging.

These schemes were used for two-point Dixon-based dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) of the breast and abdomen. Results were validated in vivo with a novel approach using variable-flip-angle data, which was retrospectively accelerated using the same methods but offered a ground truth.In breast DCE-MRI, the temporal footprint could be reduced 2.3-fold retrospectively without introducing noticeable artifacts, improving depiction of rapidly enhancing lesions. Further, experiments with variable-flip-angle data showed that reducing view sharing improved accuracy in reconstruction and T1 mapping. In abdominal MRI, 2.3-fold and 3.6-fold reductions in temporal footprint allowed reduced motion artifacts.The complementary-Poisson-disc k-space sampling trajectory allowed a retrospective spatiotemporal resolution tradeoff using CS and view sharing, imparting robustness to motion and contrast enhancement. The technique was also validated using a novel approach of fully acquired variable-flip-angle acquisition. Magn Reson Med, 2016. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We present pilot data on the biodistribution of these PET tracers in a small cohort of patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.Seven men (mean age SD, 74.3 5.9 y) with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer underwent both(68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and(68)Ga-RM2 PET/MRI scans. SUVmaxand SUVmeanwere recorded for normal tissues and areas of uptake outside the expected physiologic biodistribution.All patients had a rising level of prostate-specific antigen (mean SD, 13.5 11.5) and noncontributory results on conventional imaging.(68)Ga-PSMA-11 had the highest physiologic uptake in the salivary glands and small bowel, with hepatobiliary and renal clearance noted, whereas(68)Ga-RM2 had the highest physiologic uptake in the pancreas, with renal clearance noted. Uptake outside the expected physiologic biodistribution did not significantly differ between(68)Ga-PSMA-11 and(68)Ga-RM2; however,(68)Ga-PSMA-11 localized in a lymph node and seminal vesicle in a patient with no abnormal(68)Ga-RM2 uptake. Abdominal periaortic lymph nodes were more easily visualized by(68)Ga-RM2 in two patients because of lack of interference by radioactivity in the small intestine.(68)Ga-PSMA-11 and(68)Ga-RM2 had distinct biodistributions in this small cohort of patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. Additional work is needed to understand the expression of PSMA and gastrin-releasing peptide receptors in different types of prostate cancer.

The method was validated using realistic digital phantom simulations and demonstrated on clinical subjects. The GFR estimates using HTR-AIF were compared with estimates obtained by using an AIF derived directly from the view-shared images.Digital phantom simulations showed that using the HTR-AIF technique gives more accurate AIF estimates (RMSE=0.0932) compared with the existing estimation method (RMSE=0.2059) that used view-sharing (VS). For simulated GFR>27 mL/min, GFR estimation error was between 32% and 17% using view-shared AIF, whereas estimation error was less than 10% using HTR-AIF. In all clinical subjects, the HTR-AIF method resulted in higher GFR estimations than the view-shared method.The HTR-AIF method improves the accuracy of both the AIF and GFR estimates derived from the respiratory-gated acquisitions, and makes GFR estimation feasible in free-breathing pediatric subjects.

T2 Shuffling reduces blurring and recovers many images at multiple T2 contrasts from a single acquisition at clinically feasible scan times (6-7 min).The parallel imaging forward model is modified to account for temporal signal relaxation during the echo train. Scan efficiency is improved by acquiring data during the transient signal decay and by increasing echo train lengths without loss in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). By (1) randomly shuffling the phase encode view ordering, (2) constraining the temporal signal evolution to a low-dimensional subspace, and (3) promoting spatio-temporal correlations through locally low rank regularization, a time series of virtual echo time images is recovered from a single scan. A convex formulation is presented that is robust to partial voluming and radiofrequency field inhomogeneity.Retrospective undersampling and in vivo scans confirm the increase in sharpness afforded by T2 Shuffling. Multiple image contrasts are recovered and used to highlight pathology in pediatric patients. A proof-of-principle method is integrated into a clinical musculoskeletal imaging workflow.The proposed T2 Shuffling method improves the diagnostic utility of 3D FSE by reducing blurring and producing multiple image contrasts from a single scan.

Several excitations with the same multiband pattern progressively shifted in the phase-encode direction were used to cover the prescribed field of view (FOV). The phase-encoded FOV was limited to the width of a single band to reduce off-resonance-induced distortion and blurring. Parallel imaging (PI) techniques were used to resolve aliasing from the other bands and to combine the different excitations. Following validation in phantoms and healthy volunteers, a preliminary study in breast cancer patients (N=14) was performed to compare the proposed method to conventional DWI with PI and to reduced-FOV DWI.The proposed method gave high-resolution diffusion-weighted images with minimal artifacts at the band intersections. Compared to PI alone, higher phase-encoded FOV-reduction factors and reduced noise amplification were obtained, which translated to higher resolution images than conventional (non-multiband) DWI. The same resolution and image quality achievable over targeted regions using existing reduced-FOV methods was obtained, but the proposed method also enables complete bilateral coverage.We developed an in-plane multiband technique for high-resolution DWI and compared its performance with other standard DWI methods.

Four-dimensional phase-contrast (4D-PC) MRI has potential to simplify this exam. We sought to determine whether 4D-PC may be a viable clinical alternative to conventional 2D phase-contrast MR imaging.With institutional review board approval and HIPAA-compliance, we retrospectively identified all patients with anomalous pulmonary veins who underwent cardiac MRI at either 1.5 Tesla (T) or 3T with parallel-imaging compressed-sensing (PI-CS) 4D-PC between April, 2011 and October, 2013. A total of 15 exams were included (10 male, 5 female). Algorithms for interactive streamline visualization were developed and integrated into in-house software. Blood flow was measured at the valves, pulmonary arteries and veins, cavae, and any associated shunts. Pulmonary veins were mapped to their receiving atrial chamber with streamlines. The intraobserver, interobserver, internal consistency of flow measurements, and consistency with conventional MRI were then evaluated with Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman analysis.Triplicate measurements of blood flow from 4D-PC were highly consistent, particularly at the aortic and pulmonary valves (cv 2-3%). Flow measurements were reproducible by a second observer (=0.986-0.999). Direct measurements of shunt volume from anomalous veins and intracardiac shunts matched indirect estimates from the outflow valves (=0.966). Measurements of shunt fraction using 4D-PC using any approach were more consistent with ventricular volumetric displacements than conventional 2D-PC (=0.972-0.991 versus 0.929).Shunt flow may be reliably quantified with 4D-PC MRI, either indirectly or with detailed delineation of flow from multiple shunts. The 4D-PC may be a more accurate alternative to conventional MRI.

With Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval/informed consent, patients referred for 3T abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were scanned with conventional SSFSE and either half-Fourier (n=25) or full-Fourier vrfSSFSE (n=50). Two blinded radiologists semiquantitatively scored images on a scale from -2 to 2 for contrast, noise, sharpness, artifacts, cardiac motion-related signal loss, and the ability to evaluate the pancreas and kidneys.vrfSSFSE demonstrated significantly increased speed (2-fold, P<0.0001). Significant improvements in image quality parameters with full-Fourier vrfSSFSE included increased contrast, sharpness, and visualization of pancreatic and renal structures with higher bandwidth technique (mean scores 0.37, 0.83, 0.62, and 0.31, respectively, P0.001), and decreased image noise and improved visualization of renal structures when used with an equal bandwidth technique (mean scores 0.96 and 0.35, respectively, P<0.001). Increased cardiac motion-related signal loss with full-Fourier vrfSSFSE was seen in the pancreas but not the kidney.vrfSSFSE increases speed at 3T over conventional SSFSE via reduced SAR, and when combined with full-Fourier acquisition can improve image quality, although with some increased sensitivity to cardiac motion-related signal loss.

MRI provides critical data for diagnosis and monitoring of these patients, yielding information on cardiac anatomy, blood flow, and cardiac function. Though historically these exams have been complex and lengthy, four-dimensional (4D) flow is emerging as a single fast technique for comprehensive assessment of CHD. The 4D flow consists of a volumetric time-resolved acquisition that is gated to the cardiac cycle, providing a time-varying vector field of blood flow as well as registered anatomic images. In this article, we provide an overview of MRI evaluation of congenital heart disease by means of example of three relatively common representative conditions: tetralogy of Fallot, aortic coarctation, and anomalous pulmonary venous drainage.

A radio-frequency-spoiled gradient echo sequence with Cartesian variable density k-space sampling and radial view ordering, intrinsic motion navigation and intermittent fat suppression was developed. Images were reconstructed with soft-gated parallel imaging locally low-rank method to achieve both motion correction and high spatiotemporal resolution. Quality of delineation of 13 abdominal arteries in the reconstructed images was assessed independently by two radiologists on a five-point scale. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals of the proportion of diagnostically adequate cases were calculated. Interobserver agreements were also analyzed.Eleven out of 13 arteries achieved acceptable image quality (mean score range: 3.9-5.0) for both readers. Fair to substantial interobserver agreement was reached on nine arteries.Free-breathing spatiotemporally accelerated 3-D time-resolved contrast-enhanced MR angiography frequently yields diagnostic image quality for most abdominal arteries in young children.

With Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval/informed consent, patients referred for 3T abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were scanned with conventional SSFSE and either half-Fourier (n=25) or full-Fourier vrfSSFSE (n=50). Two blinded radiologists semiquantitatively scored images on a scale from -2 to 2 for contrast, noise, sharpness, artifacts, cardiac motion-related signal loss, and the ability to evaluate the pancreas and kidneys.vrfSSFSE demonstrated significantly increased speed (2-fold, P<0.0001). Significant improvements in image quality parameters with full-Fourier vrfSSFSE included increased contrast, sharpness, and visualization of pancreatic and renal structures with higher bandwidth technique (mean scores 0.37, 0.83, 0.62, and 0.31, respectively, P0.001), and decreased image noise and improved visualization of renal structures when used with an equal bandwidth technique (mean scores 0.96 and 0.35, respectively, P<0.001). Increased cardiac motion-related signal loss with full-Fourier vrfSSFSE was seen in the pancreas but not the kidney.vrfSSFSE increases speed at 3T over conventional SSFSE via reduced SAR, and when combined with full-Fourier acquisition can improve image quality, although with some increased sensitivity to cardiac motion-related signal loss.

Medical records were reviewed for the clinical indication, ferumoxytol dose, injection rate, sedation and any complication. A two-reader consensus scored the images on a five-point scale for overall image quality and delineation of various anatomical structures. Signal-to-background ratios for abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava for abdominal cases and blood pool-myocardium contrast ratios for cardiac cases were calculated. The confidence intervals for obtaining a score of three or above for each image parameter were calculated by using adjusted Wald method.For abdominal MR angiography, average scores for overall image quality, as well as delineation of the hepatic artery, superior mesenteric artery, renal artery and veins were 4.5, 4.3, 4.3, 3.7 and 4.7, respectively. For cardiac exams, the average scores for overall image quality, systemic arteries, pulmonary arteries, pulmonary veins, valves and ventricles were 4.4, 4.6, 4.1, 4.8, 4.1 and 4.7, respectively. For all parameters, the lower bound for the proportion of cases to have a score of 3 or above was 65%. Signal-to-background ratios for aorta and abdominal veins averaged 86 +/- 74 and 86 +/- 77 for full-dose images, and 23 and 18 for half-dose images, respectively. Mean blood pool to myocardium contrast ratio was 3:3.Ferumoxytol can provide excellent image quality for pediatric body MR angiography/MR venography at a dose of 1.5 or 3mg Fe/kg.

However radiofrequency energy deposition at 3 tesla forces long pauses between slices, leading to longer scans, longer breath-holds and more between-slice motion.We sought to learn whether modulation of the SSFSE refocusing flip-angle train could reduce radiofrequency energy deposition without degrading image quality, thereby reducing inter-slice pauses and overall scan times.We modulated the refocusing flip-angle train for SSFSE to minimize energy deposition while minimizing blurring and motion-related signal loss. In a cohort of 50 consecutive patients (25 boys, mean age 5.5years, range 1month to 17years) referred for abdominal MRI we obtained standard SSFSE and variable refocusing flip-angle (vrfSSFSE) images and recorded sequence scan times. Two readers independently scored the images in blinded, randomized order for noise, tissue contrast, sharpness, artifacts and left lobe hepatic signal uniformity on a four-point scale. The null hypothesis of no difference between SSFSE and vrfSSFSE image-quality was assessed with a Mann-Whitney U test, and the null hypothesis of no scan time difference was assessed with the paired t-test.SSFSE and vrfSSFSE mean acquisition times were 54.3 and 26.2s, respectively (P-value <0.0001). For each reader, SSFSE and vrfSSFSE noise, tissue contrast, sharpness and artifacts were not significantly different (P-values 0.18-0.86). However, SSFSE had better left lobe hepatic signal uniformity (P<0.01, both readers).vrfSSFSE is twice as fast as SSFSE, with equivalent image quality with the exception of left hepatic lobe signal heterogeneity.

We developed and validated a simplified model of tumor blood supply that can be applied to standard triphasic scans and evaluated whether this can be used to distinguish benign and malignant liver lesions. Triphasic CTs of 46 malignant and 32 benign liver lesions were analyzed. For each phase, regions of interest were drawn in the arterially enhancing portion of each lesion, as well as the background liver, aorta, and portal vein. Hepatic artery and portal vein blood supply coefficients for each lesion were then calculated by expressing the enhancement curve of the lesion as a linear combination of the enhancement curves of the aorta and portal vein. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hypervascular metastases, on average, both had increased hepatic artery coefficients compared to the background liver. Compared to HCC, benign lesions, on average, had either a greater hepatic artery coefficient (hemangioma) or a greater portal vein or transient hepatic attenuation difference). Hypervascularity with washout is a key diagnostic criterion for HCC, but it had a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 81% for diagnosing malignancy in our diverse set of liver lesions. The sensitivity for malignancy was increased to 89% by including enhancing lesions that were hypodense on all phases. The specificity for malignancy was increased to 97% (p=0.039) by also examining hepatic artery and portal vein blood supply coefficients, while maintaining a sensitivity of 76%.

Efficient denoising is achieved by appropriate shrinkage of divergence-free wavelet and nondivergence-free coefficients. SureShrink and cycle spinning are investigated to further improve denoising performance.DFW denoising was compared with existing methods on simulated and phantom data and was shown to yield better noise reduction overall while being robust to segmentation errors. The processing was applied to in vivo data and was demonstrated to improve visualization while preserving quantifications of flow data.DFW denoising of four-dimensional flow data was shown to reduce noise levels in flow data both quantitatively and visually.

Excluding patients with transposition or single ventricle physiology, a total of 34 consecutive pediatric patients (19 male, 15 female; mean age 6.9 years; age range 10 months to 15 years) were identified. 4D-PC flow measurements were compared at each valve and against routine measurements from conventional cardiac MRI using Bland-Altman and Pearson correlation analysis.Inlet and outlet valve net flow were highly correlated between all valves (P=0.940-0.985). The sum of forward flow at the outlet valve and regurgitant flow at the inlet valve were consistent with volumetric displacements in each ventricle (P=0.939-0.948). These were also highly consistent with conventional planar MRI measurements with net flow (P=0.923-0.935) and regurgitant fractions (P=0.917-0.972) at the outlet valve and ventricular volumes (P=0.925-0.965).It is possible to obtain consistent measurements of net and regurgitant blood flow across the inlet and outlet valves relying solely on accelerated 4D-PC.

Free-breathing DCE MRI with 1 mm(3) spatial resolution and a 6.5-sec frame rate was acquired on a 3T scanner. Undersampled data were reconstructed with a compressed sensing method without motion correction (FB-CS) and the proposed method (FB-LR). A follow-up respiratory-triggered acquisition (RT-CS) was performed as a reference standard. The reconstructed images were evaluated independently by two radiologists. Wilcoxon tests were performed to test the hypothesis that there was no significant difference between different reconstructions. Quantitative evaluation of contrast dynamics was also performed.The mean score of overall image quality of FB-LR was 4.0 on a 5-point scale, significantly better (P < 0.05) than FB-CS reconstruction (mean score 2.9), and similar to RT-CS (mean score 4.1). FB-LR also matched the temporal fidelity of contrast dynamics with a root mean square error less than 5%.Fast 3D free-breathing DCE MRI with high scan efficiency and image quality similar to respiratory-triggered acquisition is feasible in a pediatric clinical setting.J.

Furthermore, a variable flip angle scheme was realized by a combination of ramp-up, ramp-down, and attenuation strategies for optimizing point spread functions. Phantom and human experiments were conducted with our technique on 1.5T scanners.Using the method, T1-weighted 3D images with improved signal homogeneity were acquired with a maximum flip angle of 30 in phantom and human tests. Also, compared with the conventional navigator-gated 3D-SPGR, accurate respiratory motion detection of free-breathing subjects was provided, leading to reduced motion artifacts.The combination of wait insertion and the variable flip angle method improved both motion detection accuracy and image homogeneity in a navigator-gated 3D-SPGR study.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was acquired on a 3 Tesla scanner using a dedicated 32-channel pediatric coil and a three-dimensional SPGR sequence, with pseudo-random undersampling at a high acceleration (R = 7.2). Undersampled data were reconstructed with three methods: a traditional parallel imaging method and a combined parallel imaging compressed sensing method with and without coil compression. The three sets of images were evaluated independently and blindly by two radiologists at one siting, for overall image quality and delineation of anatomical structures. Wilcoxon tests were performed to test the hypothesis that there was no significant difference in the evaluations, and interobserver agreement was analyzed.Fast reconstruction with coil compression did not deteriorate image quality. The mean score of structural delineation of the fast reconstruction was 4.1 on a 5-point scale, significantly better (P < 0.05) than traditional parallel imaging (mean score 3.1). Fair to substantial interobserver agreement was reached in structural delineation assessment.A fast combined parallel imaging compressed sensing method is feasible in a pediatric clinical setting. Preliminary results suggest it may improve structural delineation over parallel imaging. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2014;40:13-25. 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Mainstay interventions including surgery and sclerotherapy are invasive and can result in local recurrence and complications.We sought to assess the effect of 20 weeks of oral sildenafil on reducing lymphatic malformation volume and symptoms in children.Seven children (4 boys, 3 girls; ages 13-85 months) with lymphatic malformations were given oral sildenafil for 20 weeks in this open-label study. The volume of the lymphatic malformation was calculated blindly using magnetic resonance imaging performed before and after 20 weeks of sildenafil. Lymphatic malformations were assessed clinically on weeks 4, 12, 20, and 32. Both the physician and parents evaluated the lymphatic malformation in comparison with baseline.Four subjects had a lymphatic malformation volume decrease (1.0%-31.7%). In 2 subjects, despite a lymphatic malformation volume increase (1.1%-3.7%), clinical improvement was noted while on sildenafil. One subject had a 29.6% increase in lymphatic malformation volume and no therapeutic response.

Adverse events were minimal.A randomized controlled trial will be necessary to verify the effects of sildenafil on lymphatic malformations.Sildenafil can reduce lymphatic malformation volume and symptoms in some children.

These findings were compared and correlated with the original reports and subsequent US, fluoroscopic, and CT images and reports.All initial US studies demonstrated a multiple-ring-like appearance (target sign, most apparent on transverse views) with diagnostic consensus supportive of intussusception. In three cases, US findings were somewhat discrepant with clinical concerns. Subsequently, four of the six children had contrast enemas; two were thought to have partial or complete intussusception reduction. Three had a repeat US examination, with recognition of the correct diagnosis. None of the US examinations demonstrated definite intralesional lymph nodes or mesenteric fat, but central echogenicity caused by debris/appendicolith was misinterpreted as fat. All showed perilesional hyperechogenicity that, in retrospect, represented inflamed fat \"walling off\" of the perforated appendix. There were four CTs, all of which demonstrated a double-ring appearance that correlated with the US target appearance, with inner and outer rings representing the dilated appendix and walled-off appendiceal rupture, respectively. All six children had surgical confirmation of perforated appendicitis.Contained perforated appendicitis can produce US findings closely mimicking intussusception. Clinical correlation and careful multiplanar evaluation should allow for sonographic suspicion of perforated appendicitis, which can be confirmed on CT if necessary.

The two main approaches are: SENSE, which explicitly uses coil sensitivities, and GRAPPA, which makes use of learned correlations in k-space. The purpose of this work is to clarify their relationship and to develop and evaluate an improved algorithm.A theoretical analysis shows: (1) The correlations in k-space are encoded in the null space of a calibration matrix. (2) Both approaches restrict the solution to a subspace spanned by the sensitivities. (3) The sensitivities appear as the main eigenvector of a reconstruction operator computed from the null space. The basic assumptions and the quality of the sensitivity maps are evaluated in experimental examples. The appearance of additional eigenvectors motivates an extended SENSE reconstruction with multiple maps, which is compared to existing methods.The existence of a null space and the high quality of the extracted sensitivities are confirmed. The extended reconstruction combines all advantages of SENSE with robustness to certain errors similar to GRAPPA.In this article the gap between both approaches is finally bridged. A new autocalibration technique combines the benefits of both.

A common limitation of the current strategies for motion management is that they assume a constant, reproducible respiratory cycle. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using rapid MRI for providing long-term imaging of the thorax in order to better capture cycle-to-cycle variations. Two nonsmall-cell lung cancer patients were imaged (free-breathing, no extrinsic contrast, and 1.5T scanner). A balanced steady-state-free-precession (b-SSFP) sequence was used to acquire cine-2D and cine-3D (4D) images. In the case of Patient 1 (right midlobe lesion, ~40mm diameter), tumor motion was well correlated with diaphragmatic motion. In the case of Patient 2, (left upper-lobe lesion, ~60mm diameter), tumor motion was poorly correlated with diaphragmatic motion. Furthermore, the motion of the tumor centroid was poorly correlated with the motion of individual points on the tumor boundary, indicating significant rotation and/or deformation. These studies indicate that image quality and acquisition speed of cine-2D MRI were adequate for motion monitoring. However, significant improvements are required to achieve comparable speeds for truly 4D MRI.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients were imaged with a conventional spoiled gradient echo acquisition and 48 with a high STR multiphase acquisition after the administration of gadoxetate. Arterial phase capture, image quality, and quality of fat suppression were qualitatively graded. Fourteen lesions in the conventional group and 28 in the high STR multiphase group were imaged, including 34 focal nodular hyperplasias. The ratio of lesion to parenchyma enhancement as well as relative hepatic artery enhancement were calculated. Chi-squared, Mann-Whitney U and student t-tests were used to compare differences. RESULTS: The high STR multiphase acquisition included the arterial phase more frequently than conventional acquisitions (P < 0.001), with the arterial phase missed in 17% (95% CI of 4-28%) of patients with conventional acquisition compared with 2% (95% CI of 0-6%) with the high STR multiphase acquisition. There was no loss of image quality or degree of fat saturation. Additionally, there was increased relative intensity of the hepatic arteries (P < 0.001) as well as lesion enhancement (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The high STR multiphase acquisition resulted in more reliable gadoxetate arterial phase capture compared with a conventional acquisition while preserving image quality with robust fat saturation J.

However, background suppression is limited; inflow times are inflexible; labeling region is difficult to define when tagging arterial flow; and scan times are long. To overcome these limitations, we propose the use of multiple inversion recovery preparatory pulses combined with alternating pulse repetition time balanced steady-state free precession to produce renal angiograms. Multiple inversion recovery uses selective spatial saturation followed by four nonselective inversion recovery pulses to concurrently null a wide range of background $T_1$ species while allowing for adjustable inflow times; alternating pulse repetition time steady-state free precession maintains vessel contrast and provides added fat suppression. The high level of suppression enables imaging in three-dimensional as well as projective two-dimensional formats, the latter of which has a scan time as short as one heartbeat. In vivo studies at 1.5 T demonstrate the superior vessel contrast of this technique. Magn Reson Med, 2012. 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Flow measurements were obtained in the superior and inferior vena cava, ascending and descending aorta, and the pulmonary trunk. Conservation of flow to the upper, lower, and whole body was used as an internal physiologic control. The arterial and venous flow rates at each location were compared with paired t-tests and F-tests to assess relative accuracy and precision.Arterial and venous flow measurements were strongly correlated with the upper ( = 0.89), lower ( = 0.96), and whole body ( = 0.97); net aortic and pulmonary trunk flow rates were also tightly correlated ( = 0.97). There was no significant difference in the value or precision of arterial and venous flow measurements in upper, lower, or whole body, although there was a trend toward improved precision with lower velocity-encoding settings.With PICS-4DPC MRI, the accuracy and precision of venous flow quantification are comparable to that of arterial flow quantification at velocity-encodings appropriate for arterial vessels.

Acquiring diagnostic-quality MR images in the pediatric abdomen is challenging due to motion, inability to breath hold, varying patient size, and artifacts. Motion-compensation techniques (eg, respiratory gating, signal averaging, suppression of signal from moving tissue, swapping phase- and frequency-encoding directions, use of faster sequences with breath holding, parallel imaging, and radial k-space filling) can improve image quality. Each of these techniques is more suitable for use with certain sequences and acquisition planes and in specific situations and age groups. Different T1- and T2-weighted sequences work better in different age groups and with differing acquisition planes and have specific advantages and disadvantages. Dynamic imaging should be performed differently in younger children than in older children. In younger children, the sequence and the timing of dynamic phases need to be adjusted. Different sequences work better in smaller children and in older children because of differing breath-holding ability, breathing patterns, field of view, and use of sedation. Hence, specific protocols should be maintained for younger children and older children. Combining longer-higher-resolution sequences and faster-lower-resolution sequences helps acquire diagnostic-quality images in a reasonable time.

At the same time, the growing number of elements results in larger datasets and more computation in the reconstruction. This is of particular concern in 3D acquisitions and in iterative reconstructions. Coil compression algorithms are effective in mitigating this problem by compressing data from many channels into fewer virtual coils. In Cartesian sampling there often are fully sampled k-space dimensions. In this work, a new coil compression technique for Cartesian sampling is presented that exploits the spatially varying coil sensitivities in these nonsubsampled dimensions for better compression and computation reduction. Instead of directly compressing in k-space, coil compression is performed separately for each spatial location along the fully sampled directions, followed by an additional alignment process that guarantees the smoothness of the virtual coil sensitivities. This important step provides compatibility with autocalibrating parallel imaging techniques. Its performance is not susceptible to artifacts caused by a tight imaging field-of-view. High quality compression of in vivo 3D data from a 32 channel pediatric coil into six virtual coils is demonstrated.

To properly suppress artifacts from nonrigid body motion, complex models with elements such as translation, rotation, shear, and scaling have been incorporated into the reconstruction pipeline. However, these techniques are computationally intensive and difficult to implement for online reconstruction. On a sufficiently small spatial scale, the different types of motion can be well approximated as simple linear translations. This formulation allows for a practical autofocusing algorithm that locally minimizes a given motion metric--more specifically, the proposed localized gradient-entropy metric. To reduce the vast search space for an optimal solution, possible motion paths are limited to the motion measured from multichannel navigator data. The novel navigation strategy is based on the so-called \"Butterfly\" navigators, which are modifications of the spin-warp sequence that provides intrinsic translational motion information with negligible overhead. With a 32-channel abdominal coil, sufficient number of motion measurements were found to approximate possible linear motion paths for every image voxel. The correction scheme was applied to free-breathing abdominal patient studies. In these scans, a reduction in artifacts from complex, nonrigid motion was observed.

Thirty-four consecutive retrospectively identified patients in whom a compressed-sensing parallel-imaging 4D phase-contrast sequence was performed as part of routine clinical cardiac MR imaging between March 2010 and August 2011 and who had undergone echocardiography were included. Multiplanar, volume-rendered, and stereoscopic three-dimensional velocity-fusion visualization algorithms were developed and implemented in Java and OpenGL. Two radiologists independently reviewed 4D phase-contrast studies for each of 34 patients (mean age, 6 years; age range, 10 months to 21 years) and tabulated visible shunts and valvular regurgitation. These results were compared with color Doppler echocardiographic and cardiac MR imaging reports, which were generated without 4D phase-contrast visualization. Cohen statistics were computed to assess interobserver agreement and agreement with echocardiographic results.The 4D phase-contrast acquisitions were performed, on average, in less than 10 minutes. Among 123 valves seen in 34 4D phase-contrast studies, 29 regurgitant valves were identified, with good agreement between observers (k=0.85). There was also good agreement with the presence of at least mild regurgitation at echocardiography (observer 1, =0.76; observer 2, =0.77) with high sensitivity (observer 1, 75%; observer 2, 82%) and specificity (observer 1, 97%; observer 2, 95%) relative to the reference standard.

With institutional review board approval and informed consent, 11 consecutive patients referred for abdominal MRI at 3 Tesla (T) were imaged with both DISCO and a routine clinical three-dimensional SPGR-Dixon (LAVA FLEX) sequence. All images were graded by two radiologists using quality of fat suppression, severity of artifacts, and overall image quality as scoring criteria. For assessment of arterial phase capture efficiency, the number of temporal phases with angiographic phase and hepatic arterial phase was recorded.There were no significant differences in quality of fat suppression, artifact severity or overall image quality between DISCO and LAVA FLEX images (P > 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test). The angiographic and arterial phases were captured in all 11 patients scanned using the DISCO acquisition (mean number of phases were two and three, respectively).DISCO effectively captures the fast dynamics of abdominal pathology such as hyperenhancing hepatic lesions with a high spatio-temporal resolution. Typically, 1.1 1.5 3 mm spatial resolution over 60 slices was achieved with a temporal resolution of 4-5 s.

We propose a CS objective function that minimizes cross-channel joint sparsity in the wavelet domain. Our reconstruction minimizes this objective via iterative soft-thresholding, and integrates naturally with iterative self-consistent parallel imaging (SPIRiT). Like many iterative magnetic resonance imaging reconstructions, l-SPIRiT's image quality comes at a high computational cost. Excessively long runtimes are a barrier to the clinical use of any reconstruction approach, and thus we discuss our approach to efficiently parallelizing l-SPIRiT and to achieving clinically-feasible runtimes. We present parallelizations of l-SPIRiT for both multi-GPU systems and multi-core CPUs, and discuss the software optimization and parallelization decisions made in our implementation. The performance of these alternatives depends on the processor architecture, the size of the image matrix, and the number of parallel imaging channels. Fundamentally, achieving fast runtime requires the correct trade-off between cache usage and parallelization overheads. We demonstrate image quality via a case from our clinical experimentation, using a custom 3DFT spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) sequence with up to 8 acceleration via Poisson-disc undersampling in the two phase-encoded directions.

Two versions of NORISKS were evaluated: with and without ECG gating. The images were then scored independently and in blinded manner by two radiologists on 5-point scales for visualization of the proximal and distal renal arteries and quality of fat suppression.No statistically significant difference was detected between NORISKS and routine clinical non-CE MRA in all categories except for visualization of the distal renal arteries where ungated NORISKS performed poorer than the routine non-CE MRA (P < 10(-4) ).We have demonstrated a promising non-CE MRA method for acquiring renal angiograms within a breathhold without any compromise in spatial resolution or coverage. ECG-gated NORISKS is able to acquire renal angiograms that are comparable to a routine clinical non-CE MRA method (Inhance IFIR, GE Healthcare), which requires approximately seven times the scan time of NORISKS.

Scan acquisition, however, is lengthy and highly reliant on an imager who is well-versed in structural heart disease. Although it can also be lengthy, 3D time-resolved (4D) phase-contrast MRI yields global flow patterns and is simpler to perform. We therefore sought to accelerate 4D phase contrast and to determine whether equivalent flow and volume measurements could be extracted.Four-dimensional phase contrast was modified for higher acceleration with compressed sensing. Custom software was developed to process 4D phase-contrast images. We studied 29 patients referred for congenital cardiac MRI who underwent a routine clinical protocol, including cine short-axis stack SSFP and 2D phase contrast, followed by contrast-enhanced 4D phase contrast. To compare quantitative measurements, Bland-Altman analysis, paired Student t tests, and F tests were used.Ventricular end-diastolic, end-systolic, and stroke volumes obtained from 4D phase and SSFP were well correlated ( = 0.91-0.95; r(2) = 0.83-0.90), with no statistically significant difference. Ejection fractions were well correlated in a subpopulation that underwent higher-resolution Four-dimensional phase contrast and 2D phase contrast flow rates were also well correlated ( 0.90; r(2) = 0.82). Excluding ventricles with valvular insufficiency, cardiac outputs derived from outlet valve flow and stroke volumes were more consistent by 4D phase contrast than by 2D phase contrast and SSFP.Combined parallel imaging and compressed sensing can be applied to 4D phase contrast. With custom software, flow and ventricular volumes may be extracted with comparable accuracy to SSFP and 2D phase contrast. Furthermore, cardiac outputs were more consistent by 4D phase contrast.

The purpose of this work is to develop and clinically evaluate a weighted least squares algorithm based on T(2) Iterative Decomposition of water and fat with Echo Asymmetry and Least-squares estimation (IDEAL) technique for volumetric estimation of hepatic T(2) in the setting of iron overload. The weighted least squares T(2) IDEAL technique improves T(2) estimation by automatically decreasing the impact of later, noise-dominated echoes. The technique was evaluated in 37 patients with iron overload. Each patient underwent (i) a standard 2D multiple-echo gradient echo sequence for T(2) assessment with nonlinear exponential fitting, and (ii) a 3D T(2) IDEAL technique, with and without a weighted least squares fit. Regression and Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated strong correlation between conventional 2D and T(2) IDEAL estimation. In cases of severe iron overload, T(2) IDEAL without weighted least squares reconstruction resulted in a relative overestimation of T(2) compared with weighted least squares.

Twenty-three consecutive children referred for pediatric heart disease receiving gadofosveset were recruited in HIPAA-compliant fashion with IRB approval and informed consent. Children underwent standard non-triggered contrast-enhanced MRA with or without suspended respiration. Additionally, a free-breathing-triggered MRA was acquired. Triggered and non-triggered studies were presented in blinded random order independently to two radiologists twice. Anatomical structure delineation was graded for each triggered and non-triggered acquisition and the visual quality on triggered MRA was compared directly to that on non-triggered MRA.Triggered images received higher scores from each radiologist for all anatomical structures on each of the two reading sessions (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P<0.05). In direct comparison, triggered images were preferred over non-triggered images for delineating cardiac structures, with most comparisons reaching statistical significance (binomial test, P<0.05).Combined cardiac and respiratory triggering, enabled by a blood pool contrast agent, improves delineation of most anatomical structures in pediatric cardiovascular MRA.

The use of Gd-EOB-DTPA was classified in each case as definite, potential, or no clinical utility, focusing on the clinical value gained beyond traditional noncontrast fluid-sensitive MR cholangiopancreatography (FS-MRCP) and other imaging modalities.Definite added value of Gd-EOB-DTPA was found in 12 patients, with potential value in 4 patients, and no value in 5 patients. Benefit was seen in cases of iatrogenic and non-iatrogenic biliary strictures, perihepatic fluid collections for biliary leak, hepatobiliary dysfunction in the absence of hyperbilirubinemia, and in the functional exclusion of cystic duct occlusion that can be seen in acute cholecystitis.This is the first reported series of children with Gd-EOB-DTPA and this early work suggests potential pediatric applications.

Currently, this is often accomplished with tagged red blood cell scintigraphy, with attendant ionizing radiation and relatively poor spatial resolution. We describe an analogous method of detecting acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage by enhanced MRI with blood pool contrast agent. following precontrast fat-suppressed volumetric T1-weighted image acquisition, single-dose gadofosveset trisodium, a blood pool agent, is administered. Then serial post-T1-weighted images are obtained. This technique is a novel method for evaluating gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

Volumetric T2 imaging with Dixon-type fat-water separation might address this challenge, but it is a lengthy process.We develop and evaluate a faster two-echo approach to volumetric T2 imaging with fat-water separation.A volumetric spin-echo sequence was modified to include a second shifted echo so two image sets are acquired. A region-growing reconstruction approach was developed to decompose separate water and fat images. Twenty-six children were recruited with IRB approval and informed consent. Fat-suppression quality was graded by two pediatric radiologists and compared against conventional fat-suppressed fast spin-echo T2-W images. Additionally, the value of in- and opposed-phase images was evaluated.Fat suppression on volumetric images had high quality in 96% of cases (95% confidence interval of 80-100%) and were preferred over or considered equivalent to conventional two-dimensional fat-suppressed FSE T2 imaging in 96% of cases (95% confidence interval of 78-100%). In- and opposed-phase images had definite value in 12% of cases.Volumetric fat-water separated T2-weighted MRI is feasible and is likely to yield improved fat suppression over conventional fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging.

Time-resolved volumetric PC-MRI (4-D flow) may address these limitations.We assess the degree of agreement and internal consistency between 2-D and 4-D flow quantification in our clinical population.Software enabling flow calculation from 4-D flow was developed in Java. With IRB approval and HIPAA compliance, 18 consecutive patients without shunts were identified who underwent both (1) conventional 2-D PC-MRI of the aorta and main pulmonary artery and (2) 4-D flow imaging. Aortic and pulmonary flow rates were assessed with both techniques.Both methods showed general agreement in flow rates (: 0.87-0.90). Systemic and pulmonary arterial flow rates were well-correlated (: 4-D 0.98-0.99, 2-D 0.93), but more closely matched with 4-D (P < 0.05, Brown-Forsythe). Pulmonary flow rates were lower than systemic rates for 2-D (P < 0.05, two-sample t-test). In a sub-analysis of patients without pulmonary or aortic regurgitation, 2-D showed improved correlation of flow rates tightly correlated (: 4-D greater consistency than conventional PC-MRI for flow quantification.

A pseudorandom k-space undersampling pattern was incorporated into a three-dimensional (3D) gradient-echo sequence; aliasing then has an incoherent noiselike pattern rather than the usual coherent fold-over wrapping pattern. This k-space-sampling pattern was combined with a compressed sensing nonlinear reconstruction method that exploits the assumption of sparsity of medical images to permit reconstruction from undersampled k-space data and remove the noiselike aliasing. Thirty-four patients (15 female and 19 male patients; mean age, 8.1 years; range, 0-17 years) referred for cardiovascular, abdominal, and knee MR imaging were scanned with this 3D gradient-echo sequence at high acceleration factors. Obtained k-space data were reconstructed with both a traditional parallel imaging algorithm and the nonlinear method. Both sets of images were rated for image quality, radiologist preference, and delineation of specific structures by two radiologists. Wilcoxon and symmetry tests were performed to test the hypothesis that there was no significant difference in ratings for image quality, preference, and delineation of specific structures.Compressed sensing images were preferred more often, had significantly higher image quality ratings, and greater delineation of anatomic structures (P < .001) than did images obtained with the traditional parallel reconstruction method.A combination of parallel imaging and compressed sensing is feasible in a clinical setting and may provide higher resolution and/or faster imaging, addressing the challenge of delineating anatomic structures in pediatric MR imaging.

Although navigation has been commonly employed for coronary MRA and T2-W imaging, navigation for T1-W imaging is less developed. Thus, we incorporated a navigator pulse into a fat-suppressed T1-W SPGR sequence such that steady-state contrast was not disrupted. Ten children were scanned after gadolinium administration three times in immediate succession: breath-hold with no navigation, free-breathing with navigation, and free-breathing without navigation. Motion artifacts were scored for each sequence by two radiologists,showing fewer motion artifacts with navigation compared to free-breathing and greater motion artifacts than with breath-holding. This work demonstrates the feasibility and potential utility of navigation for pediatric abdominal T1-W imaging.

Currently, most evaluation of musculoskeletal pathology is done with two-dimensional acquisition techniques such as fast spin echo (FSE) imaging. The development of three-dimensional fast imaging methods based on balanced steady-state free precession (SSFP) shows great promise to improve MRI of the musculoskeletal system. These methods may allow acquisition of fluid sensitive isotropic data that can be reformatted into arbitrary planes for improved detection and visualization of pathology. Sensitivity to fluid and fat suppression are important issues in these techniques to improve delineation of cartilage contours, for detection of marrow edema and derangement of other joint structures.

The study cohort consisted of 10 healthy volunteers (four men, six women; age range, 26-42 years). Cartilage cartilage-fluid contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), CNR efficiency, image quality, cartilage visibility, and fat suppression were compared. Cartilage volume was compared for the fluctuating equilibrium and 3D SPGR techniques. Compared with 3D SPGR and 2D fast SE, fluctuating equilibrium yielded the highest cartilage SNR efficiency and cartilage-fluid CNR efficiency (P < .01 for both). Image quality was similar with all sequences. Fluctuating equilibrium imaging yielded higher cartilage visibility than did 2D fast SE imaging (P <. 01) but worse fat suppression than did 3D SPGR and 2D fast SE imaging (P < .04). Cartilage volume measurements with fluctuating equilibrium and 3D SPGR were similar. Fluctuating equilibrium MR imaging is a promising method for evaluating articular cartilage in the knee.

Despite these strengths, the clinical feasibility of balanced SSFP is still limited both by bright fat signal and by the signal voids that result from off-resonance effects such as field or susceptibility variations. A new method, dual-acquisition phase-sensitive SSFP, combines the signals from two standard balanced SSFP acquisitions to separate fat and water while simultaneously reducing the signal voids. The acquisitions are added in quadrature and then phase corrected using a simple algorithm before fat and water can be identified simply by the sign of the signal. This method is especially useful for applications at high field, where the RF power deposition, spatial resolution requirements and gradient strength limit the minimum repetition times. Finally, dual-acquisition phase-sensitive SSFP can be combined with other magnetization preparation schemes to produce specific image contrast in addition to separating fat and water signals.

The development of new, fast imaging methods with high contrast will improve the MR evaluation of cartilage morphology. In addition to morphological MR imaging methods, MR imaging contrast mechanisms under development may reveal detailed information regarding the physiology of cartilage. However, many of these methods remain to be tested in the clinical setting. Protocol selection for cartilage imaging requires understanding of the patient population and the advantages and limitations of these techniques.

Institutional review board approval was obtained; informed consent was exempted. Emergency studies were modeled as a Poisson process; slots were reserved such that rate of rescheduling of routine studies to accommodate emergencies was predicted to be below a certain level. Model was tested with 3 years of emergency US and CT requests. US and CT requests showed Poisson distribution. US rescheduling was near that predicted. CT rescheduling exceeded that predicted, which reflected increasing CT use. By using more recent CT data for prediction, a more concordant rescheduling rate resulted.

Several methods have been proposed to reduce SSFP banding artifact by combining multiple phase-cycled SSFP acquisitions, each differing in how individual signal magnitudes and phases are combined. These include maximum-intensity SSFP complex-sum SSFP (CS-SSFP). The reduction is accompanied by a loss in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency. In this work a general framework for analyzing banding artifact reduction, contrast, and SNR of any multiple-acquisition SSFP combination method is presented. A new sum-of-squares method is proposed, and a comparison is performed between each of the combination schemes. The sum-of-squares SSFP technique (SOS-SSFP) delivers both robust banding artifact reduction and higher SNR efficiency than other multiple-acquisition techniques, while preserving SSFP contrast.

In SSFP, the signal is refocused midway between excitation pulses, much like in a spin-echo experiment. However, in SSFP, the phase of the refocused spins alternates for each resonant frequency interval equal to the reciprocal of the sequence repetition time (TR). Appropriate selection of the TR results in a 180 degrees phase difference between lipid and water signals. This phase difference can be used for fat-water separation in SSFP without any increase in scan time. The technique is shown to produce excellent non-contrast-enhanced, flow-independent angiograms of the peripheral vasculature.

MRI is the most accurate noninvasive method of diagnosing cartilage lesions. However, MR imaging of cartilage is limited by scan time, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and image contrast. Recently, there has been renewed interest in SNR-efficient imaging sequences for imaging cartilage, including various forms of steady-state free-precession as well as driven-equilibrium imaging. This work compares several of these sequences with existing methods, both theoretically and in normal volunteers. Results show that the new steady-state methods increase SNR-efficiency by as much as 30% and improve cartilage-synovial fluid contrast by a factor of three. Additionally, these methods markedly decrease minimum scan times, while providing 3D coverage without the characteristic blurring seen in fast spin-echo images.

Although these sequences offer fast scanning with good signal-to-noise efficiency, the \"transient response,\" or time taken to reach a steady-state, can be long compared with the total imaging time, particularly when using 2D sequences. This results in lost imaging time and has made SSFP difficult to use for real-time and cardiac-gated applications. A linear-systems analysis of the steady-state and transient response for general periodic sequences is shown. The analysis is applied to refocused-SSFP sequences to generate a two-stage method of \"catalyzing,\" or speeding up the progression to steady-state by first scaling, then directing the magnetization. This catalyzing method is compared with previous methods in simulations and experimentally. Although the second stage of the method exhibits some sensitivity to B(1) variations, our results show that the transient time can be significantly reduced, allowing imaging in a shorter total scan time.

Combining k-space data from SSFP sequences with certain phase schedules of radiofrequency excitation pulses permits manipulation of the spectral selectivity of the image. For example, lipid and water can be resolved. The contrast of each image depends on both T1 and T2, and the relative contribution of the two relaxation mechanisms to image contrast can be controlled by adjusting the flip angle. Several potential applications of the technique, referred to as linear combination steady-state free precession (LCSSFP), are demonstrated: fast musculoskeletal, abdominal, angiographic, and brain imaging.

With all gradients refocused over a repetition interval, certain phase schedules of radiofrequency excitation pulses produce an equilibrium magnetization that fluctuates from excitation to excitation, thus permitting simultaneous acquisition of several images with different contrast features. For example, lipid and water images can be rapidly acquired. The effective echo time can be adjusted using the flip angle, thus providing control over the T(2) contribution to the contrast. Several applications of the technique are presented, including fast musculoskeletal, abdominal, breast, and brain imaging, in addition to MR angiography.

The method interlaces a triggering pulse sequence with an imaging sequence. The triggering sequence is designed to measure aortic blood velocity, from which cardiac phase can be inferred. The triggering sequence is executed repeatedly and the acquired data processed after each sequence iteration. When the desired phase of the cardiac cycle is detected, data are acquired using the imaging sequence. A signal-processing unit of a conventional scanner is used to process the triggering data in real time and issue triggering commands. Alternatively, a workstation, with a bus adaptor, can access data as they are acquired, process and display the data, and issue triggering commands. With a graphical user interface, the triggering pulse sequence and data-processing techniques can be modified instantaneously to optimize triggering. The technique is demonstrated with coronary artery imaging using both conventional two-dimensional Fourier transform scans and spiral trajectories. View details for [Web of Science ID "}
