When I began my integrative medicine consultative practice, I realized very quickly that the majority of my patients could improve their health by changing what they ate. The world of dieting nutrition is complex and there are so many expert opinions out there. It is hard for people to know who to trust, what to read and what diet to follow. I had extensive experience and education on nutrition began to share this with my patients through one on one appointments in my clinic. As I began to see trends in what I was teaching and the questions my patients were asking, I developed a course that covered all of the common material my patients needed and Food for Fuel was born. Why is Food for Fuel different than any other \"plan\" out there? Food for Fuel is unique because it was created as a core solution to many problems surrounding food. It was written based on real insights gained working one-on-one in clinic. During this course, you'll receive daily emails and videos from me leading you through the transition from a typical American diet to a \"clean\" whole foods, plant based diet. Throughout the course you'll have a chance to implement small, steady steps to create a lasting change over time. What is clean eating? Clean eating is eating a diet that decreases inflammation in your body which is one of the greatest sources of chronic disease and suffering (heart disease, diabetes, obesity). I describe it as a whole foods, plant based diet, full of plant sourced foods like vegetables, grains, legumes and fruit in addition to healthy fats and healthy sources of animal protein. Clean eating also means staying away from or minimizing the foods that increase inflammation like highly processed foods, unhealthy fats and sugar. Don't see a question answered "}
