Not all headaches are considered the same and depending on the symptoms, and they are treated by what they headache feels like, i.e. pulsating pain, pinching sensations, along with other symptoms. Acupuncture has been tried and tested scientifically to work for reducing and in many cases eliminating pain completely in a myriad of different health conditions including headaches. Tension Headaches Tension headaches are dull pain, tightness, or pressure around your forehead or the back of your head and neck. These are often the result of stress, and they are the most common type of headache. Migraines Migraine headaches are moderate to severe, with sensitivity to light and sound. Often they are preceded by warning symptoms such as changes in vision. They are often associated with triggers including hormones, pressure changes, certain foods and drinks.

When you are suffering a headache, it isn't only your head or nerve endings that aren't functioning correctly. The whole system is unbalanced which is manifested in your body as a migraine or a headache. The most important benefit of acupuncture for headaches is that it doesn't only treat your headache, it also addresses your imbalances to promote and preserve vibrant health. "}
