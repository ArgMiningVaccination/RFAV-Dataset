Nature Made's sole mission is to enhance the pursuit of a vibrant life. Backed by science and a commitment to quality, Nature Made was founded in 1971 by Barry Pressman and Henry Burdick, who believed there was a better alternative to long term health than prescription drugs. Today, Nature Made is the #1 Pharmacist Recommended Vitamin and Supplement brand in nine product segments.* In my early days as a pharmacist, I became very disenchanted with filling prescriptions that messed with people's minds, emotions, brains, different parts of their body. It started to wear on me until I didn't feel good about it at all and I wanted to do something good for people. Three Key Brand Ingredients Every Nature Made product is created with three core values in mind - Science, Innovation and Quality. Science Scientific research is the starting point for every product we make, to ensure Nature Made delivers real nutrition to consumers. Whether from published research or our own clinical trials, we only make dietary supplements that our scientists have concluded science supports as being safe when taken as directed and providing a benefit. Innovation Nature Made has a deep understanding of our consumer, and we strive to make products that are not only effective, but fulfill a specific purpose. Whether developing our own products or partnering with emerging technologies and companies in the wellness industry, our cross-functional Innovation team is dedicated to driving innovation as a growth engine for Pharmavite, and to accelerate the launch of new-to-market solutions.
