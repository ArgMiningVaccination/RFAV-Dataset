Resurgence of pertussis was rst observed in 1976 in the UnitedStates(7)despitewidespreadandsustainedwhole-cellpertussisimmunizationsince1951.Thisresurgencemaybe,inpart,attributedtowaningvaccine-inducedimmunity(16).Theabsenceofrepeatedboosters,byeitherimmunizationorex-posuretoinfectedpersons(naturalbooster),isthemainex-planationforthisphenomenon.Theuseofnewandsafeacel-lularpertussisvaccinesforboostersininfancyorlaterinagemay therefore be the answer. The French pertussis vaccine(Tetracoq and DTCP, the same vaccine licensed by PasteurMe\u00b4rieuxSerumetVaccins)isawhole-celltypecombinedwith diphtheriaandtetanustoxoidsandwiththethreeinactivatedpoliomyelitis strains. This vaccine has been widely used inFrance since 1966. Thus, the epidemiological situation ofFranceappearstobecomparabletothatoftheUnitedStateswith regard to the massive and sustained use of whole-cellpertussisvaccinebutwithadelayof15years.Asamatteroffact,asimilarresurgenceofpertussishasbeensuspectedinFrancesince1991(12)butstillneedstobeconrmedbeforeboostervaccinationcanberecommended. PertussisacellularvaccineshavebeenusedinJapansince 1981 (3) and have been recommended for boosters in theUnitedStatessince1991(2).Antigensincludedinthesevac-cinesarepertussistoxin(PT)andadhesinssuchaslamentoushemagglutinin(FHA),pertactin(PRN),andmbrialaggluti-nogens (AG). These antigens have been shown to induce aprotectiveimmunityinmurinemodels.However,nocorrela-tionhasbeenmadebetweenprotectionandthelevelofanti-bodyagainstoneoftheseantigensinpreviousclinicalassays(1). Most of the previously published serological studies ofvaccinatedchildrenhavebeenlimitedtoanalysisofantibodyresponses to PT, FHA, PRN, and AG shortly after the lastimmunization.Furthermore,littleinformationisavailablecon-cerninganother Bordetellapertussis antigen,adenylatecyclase- hemolysin(AC-Hly),whichwasshownrecently(i)toinduceanantibodyresponseafterpertussisinfection(13)andpertussisvaccination (11), (ii) to be a protective antigen in a murinemodel(14),and(iii)toplayanimportantrolein B.pertussis pathogenesis(18-20,26). The purpose of our study was to analyze the duration of antibodyresponsesnotonlytoPT,FHA,PRN,andAGbutalso to AC-Hly after immunization with whole-cell pertussisvaccine and to against pertussis (four injections) weretested for pertussis serology 0.5 to 158 months after the last vaccination. AllchildrenwerehospitalizedattheTrousseauchildren'shospitalforvariousdis-easesexcludingpertussisandpertussissyndrome(prolongedparoxysmalcoughor whoops). However, no information concerning past history of pertussis orprolongedcoughcompatiblewithanatypicalpertussissyndromeorpastexpo-sure to a pertussis case was recorded. Vaccination B. pertussisP134, 93respectively. PT and FHA were puried from kind gift of in France by immunoblot. Be- tween January 1991 and July 1993, 360 vaccinated childrenaged between 20 months and 16 years had a serum samplecollectedforpertussisserology.Thetimeelapsedbetweenthecollectionofserumandthelastvaccinationrangedfrom0.5to158 months. All sera were tested for antibodies directedagainstPT,FHA,PRN,AC-Hly-1,andAC-Hly-2byimmuno-blottingandtestedforanti-AGantibodiesbymicroagglutina-tion. The mean age for the rst injection was 4.4 months(range,1.8to11.8months),andthemeanintervalsbetweentherstandsecondinjections,thesecondandthirdinjectionsandthethirdinjectionandtheboosterwere,respectively,1.5(range,0.7to6.9),1.7(range,0.6to16),and13.6(range,1.4to47.4)months.Theseraofvaccinatedchildrenwereclassiedbygroupsofincreasingtimeelapsedbetweenthecollectionofserumandthelastvaccination.TheMTPVandtheDRofeachantibodyforeachgroupofseraareindicatedinTable1.TheDRsofanti-PT,-FHA,-PRN,-AG,and-AC-Hly-1antibodieswere high shortly after vaccination (group other B. pertussisstrains.

As shown in Table 1, a signicant decreaseoftheDRsofanti-PT,-PRN,and-AGantibodieswasinitiallyobservedandwasfollowedbyasecondaryincreaseofthe corresponding DR more than 60 months after the lastimmunization.Bylinearandpolynomialregressiontests,thecorrelationsbetweentheMTPVandDRwereanalyzed,andtheresultsareshowninFig.1.Foranti-PTantibodies,arapidinitialdecreaseoftheDRwithtimeafterimmunizationwasobservedandwasfollowed,60monthsaftervaccination,byanincreaseoftheDR(Fig.1A).AsignicantcorrelationbetweentheMTPVandDRwasfoundwithapolynomialregressionmodel(order2).Thisphenomenonwasnotspecictoanti-PTantibodiesbutwasalsoobservedwithanti-PRN(Fig.1B)andanti-AGantibodies(Fig.1C).Thesecondaryincreaseofthedetectionratesofanti-PT,-PRN,and-AGantibodiesobserved80monthsafterthelastimmunizationindicatesthat B.pertus- sisinfectionmayoccurinvaccinatedchildreninourcountry.

In the present study, we used immunoblot instead of en- zyme-linked immunosorbent assay detected by immunoblot (13), (ii) the amount of puried antigen required for ELISA is larger than that re-quiredforimmunoblot,(iii)immunoblotisnowadaptedforroutinediagnosis(withready-to-usegels),and(iv)immuno-blot is sensitive and specic and allows the control of thestabilityoftheantigenforeachexperiment.ELISAandim-munoblotcannotbecomparedsinceELISAdetectsantibodieswhichrecognizeproteinsinanativeconformationandimmu- noblot detects antibodies which recognize mostly denaturedproteins.Thus,ourstudydescribedtheevolutionofacertaintype of pertussis antibodies after immunization which mighthavebeendifferentifwehadusedELISA. However,ourresultsareinagreementwiththoseofother studieswhichusedELISAorimmunoblot(4,6,22,24,25)and FIG. 1. CorrelationsbetweenthemeantimepostimmunizationandtheDRs(percent)ofantibodiesdirectedagainstpertussisantigens:PT(A),PRN(B),AG(C), FHA(D),AC-Hly-1(E),andAC-Hly-2(F).VOL.3,1996 ANTIBODY RESPONSES AFTER PERTUSSIS VACCINATION 95showed that pertussis whole-cell vaccine induces antibodies directedagainstPT,FHA,PRN,andAG.InaSwedishsero-logicalstudyusingELISAandconductedwithchildrenprimedwithwhole-cellpertussisvaccineandboostedwithanacellularvaccine (8), a rapid decrease of anti-PT antibodies was ob-served in the months following either primo-vaccination orbooster. Using immunoblot, we conrmed these data andshowedthatarapiddecreaseindetectionisalsoobservedwithanti-PRN and anti-AG antibodies 2 years after vaccination.Thisresultisaconrmationthatwhole-cellpertussisvaccine-inducedprotectionislimitedintime.Sincetheintroductionofwhole-cellpertussisvaccineinFrance,pertussismorbidityde-creasedand,asaconsequence,naturalboostersduetoexpo-sure to pertussis cases became rare. The present suspectedresurgenceofpertussisinFrancemaybeexplained,asintheUnitedStates,bytheincreasingnumberofvaccinatedadultswhoaresusceptibletopertussis. ThesecondaryincreaseoftheDRsofanti-PT,-PRN,and -AGantibodiesobserved80monthsafterthelastvaccinationsuggeststhatB.pertussisinfectionoccursinvaccinatedchildren inourcountryandthatthewhole-cellvaccinedoesnotprotectformorethan6yearsincountrieswithlowpertussismorbidity.Inarecentpublication(15),usingcultureandPCRtodiag-noseB. immunoblot.

(ii) FHA is not specic Inconclusion,ourstudydemonstratesthattheFrenchper- tussis whole-cell vaccine induces the synthesis of antibodiesagainstPT,FHA,PRN,AG,andAC-Hly.Intheabsenceoflateboostervaccination,anti-PT,-PRN,and-AGantibodiesdecrease rapidly after the fourth injection (at 18 months ofage)butincreaselater,morethan80monthsaftervaccination,suggestingpersistentcirculationof B.pertussisstrainsandex- posuretoinfectedpersons.Theconsequenceisthatunrecog-nizedpertussisiscommoninFrancedespitemassiveandsus-tained immunization in infants and that vaccinated childrenbecomesusceptibletoinfectionmorethan6yearsaftertheirlastvaccination.Anationalepidemiologicalstudywasrecentlyperformed in France to conrm this Bordetellaadenylate cyclase-hemolysin against bacterial colonization.
