Blumenthal, MD, and colleagues share their findings on reactions and responses Around 13 billion COVID19 vaccine doses have been administered globally to date. While getting the jabs has allowed the world to return, more or less, to normal, allergic reactions to the mRNA vaccines are still a concern, but researchers are making headway on the issue. These allergic reactions can be \"attributed to a potential culprit excipient, polyethylene glycol (PEG). Theoretical crossreactivity of PEG with a related compound, polysorbate 80 (PS), the excipient in adenoviralvector COVID19 vaccines, has been discussed,\" explained Matthew Greenhawt, MD, of Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora, and colleagues. But there's growing data suggesting that \"immediate allergic reactions to mRNA COVID19 vaccines are very rare, and may not necessarily be the result of an excipientdriven, IgEmediated process,\" they said. Greenhawt's group performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess vaccine/excipient skin-testing (ST) accuracy in predicting allseverity immediate allergic reactions upon revaccination, and reported in [Allergy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9878056/) that ST was not up to par with \"poor accuracy for ST with mRNA COVID19 vaccine or vaccine excipients to predict vaccine tolerance with a 2nd vaccination after an immediate reaction to a 1st dose, as a means of sole riskstratification.\" Kimberly G. Blumenthal, MD, MSc, of Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), both in Boston, and colleagues (including Greenhawt), authored a \"Clinical Management Review\" to update COVID-19 vaccine reactions, including their epidemiology, and offered guidance on how to evaluate and management these events. They explained in the [ Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology](https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(23)00723-7/pdf) that serious adverse effects following immunization are rare, particularly when compared with the large number of vaccine doses administered,\" while \"[i]mmediate and delayed reactions are relatively common and present similarly to allergic and hypersensitivity reactions.\" The groundwork for these studies was no doubt laid by earlier research from Blumenthal and colleagues, which found that allergic reactions to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines occurred in up to 2% of recipients. Their 2022 single-center pilot study showed that when compared with 18 vaccine nonallergic individuals, eight people with immediate allergic reactions to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines mounted lower immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) to multiple antigenic targets in significantly lower IgG1 to full-length spike (P=0.04). The study in the [Journal of Infectious Diseases](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/226/7/1231/6553054) also showed that allergic individuals bound Fc receptor (FcR) similarly to nonallergic controls. Although an overall reduction in opsonophagocytic function was identified in individuals with immediate allergic reactions, the researchers noted that allergic patients produced functional antibodies with a high ratio of opsonophagocytic function to IgG1 titer. \"These findings suggest potential quantitative deficits in COVID-19 protection in individuals with mRNA COVID-19 vaccine allergy...these initial data support the need for additional immunologic investigations in individuals with allergic responses and clinical and population efforts to assist mRNA vaccine-allergic individuals in completing and optimizing their COVID-19 vaccination protection,\" they said. In this interview conducted when the Journal of Infectious Diseases study was published in 2022, Blumenthal discussed the findings. She is an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard; the quality and safety officer for allergy at MGH; and the co-director of the clinical epidemiology program in the MGH division of rheumatology allergy and immunology. How do your results compare with previous data? Blumenthal: Our study showed that patients with allergic reactions after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination present with a different COVID-19 antibody profile compared to nonallergic controls. Allergic patients displayed significantly lower levels of IgG1, potentially suggesting decreased protection from COVID-19, although this finding may be associated with allergy to COVID-19 vaccines or a general allergic history. While antibody studies on COVID-19 vaccine allergy are still in infancy, other immunologic studies have found diminished COVID-19 antibodies among those with [immunodeficiency](https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(22)00231-8/fulltext), inborn errors of [immunity](https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(21)01356-7/fulltext), and [leukemia](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-021-01354-7). This could indicate that similar consideration should be given to vaccine-allergic patients as to those with immunodeficiency. However, patients with allergy require deeper clinical consideration. Most immunodeficient patients can simply receive more doses to boost their immune response, but this is not an option after a severe allergic reaction. What is your take-home message for physicians? Blumenthal: Because of the potential risk for diminished vaccine protection -- and corticosteroids being a common immunosuppressive treatment for allergic reactions -- clinicians should prescribe corticosteroids sparingly for COVID-19 vaccine reactions, to not impede the vaccine's immune response in a population that may decline boosters. Do you think that immediate-onset allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccination could be related to something other than an allergic response? Blumenthal: We suspect that many of the reported allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccination are immunologic but not truly allergic, representing a diverse range of immunologic reactions, only beginning to be differentiated and deciphered. In the study, all allergic individuals were female with a median age 40. Do you consider this significant? Blumenthal: The demographics of allergic individuals in our study align with [our other assessments](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777417) of individuals with [reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(21)00657-7/fulltext). We believe that this may be significant, potentially indicating a mechanistic difference in COVID-19 reactions based on sex, known to be a contributing factor in other allergic conditions. However, explanations for these reactions beyond allergy, such as stress responses to vaccination and psychosomatic symptoms, are also more common among female individuals.
