Praise For... \"While Buddhist meditation has been considered one of the first world medicines, many of our current books do not focus on the healing medicine of our practices. This book is a notable exception. Terry is a wonderful teacher who has collected many powerful practices from the Buddhist tradition and offers them with simple and clear guidelines. According to Buddhist belief, a compassionate person is the most powerful healer. Terry offers us ways to access our compassion and to cultivate our mind of love. And yes, love creates health.\" \u2014Dr. Peggy Rowe Ward, PhD, Senior Dharma Teacher in the tradition of Thich Nhat Hanh and Author of Making Friends with Time \"This precious book is for anyone who sincerely wants to grow in the skillfulness of living. It is a fine resource for beginners or experienced practitioners of awakening. Within its pages lives a diversity of practical magic that heals as we learn to be more deeply human.\" \u2014Dr. Larry Ward, PhD, Author of America's Racial Karma: An Invitation to Heal \"Buddhism for Healing is a true treasure and a deep medicine chest of resources for healing in its meditations, contemplations, mantras, prayers, rituals, and ceremonies. The author, Terry Cort\u00e9s-Vega, has curated an impressive catalog of Buddhist practices drawn from the several Buddhist traditions. Each page brings home the wisdom, insight, love, and gentle wit of a contemporary bodhisattva channeling 2500 years of Dharmic experience and perceptual training. Counselors, therapists, educators, parents, and grandparents will find much to value in this collection. As a mindfulness instructor in staff and faculty development and in more traditional collegiate classrooms, I anticipate that this text will be a ready resource in my future lesson planning.\" \u2014Curtis Hirsh, Mindfulness Instructor "}
