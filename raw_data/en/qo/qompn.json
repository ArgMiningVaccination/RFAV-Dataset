I simply look for and correct any disturbance between the brain and the body that happens in the nervous system (we call it a subluxation or vertebral subluxation complex). When subluxation is present it interferes with the body's natural ability to comprehend itself and or the environment and therefore the body's adaptability. Regardless of what type of medical diagnosis a person may present to my office with my only goal is to 'reunite man the physical with man the spiritual', and allow for the body's innate intelligence to be expressed perfectly. When we do this the body knows exactly what its needs are and how to accomplish them better, faster, and more complete than any doctor that will ever walk this earth. There are so many children today being placed on the Autism Spectrum and it is my firm belief that everyone of these children should be checked by a chiropractor regularly throughout every stage of their life to allow for optimal expression of their genetic potential. The health of the nervous system is paramount in making this happen. \"Hi Doctor, The lovely woman, Lorna, who runs the social groups at the Autism Project in Johnston took me aside tonight and said that Grace has really blossomed in group these past three weeks. She said that Grace is calling people by name, has less anxiety and is participating without being asked. She is also staying more on topic during conversations. Lorna has known Gracie for about two years and has never really commented on her participation before, so this is new and different. Have a nice night and weekend!

(25) carried out a series of chiropractic adjustments on 26 autistic children over a 9-month period. Twelve were found to have a left atlas laterality and 14 had a right atlas laterality. Outcomes from the study were varied but included normalization of deep tendon reflexes and dermatomal subjective sensation, increased cervical range of motion and reduction of other health problems. Many of the children were taken off Ritalin, bladder and bowel control improved, some children started to speak and eye contact and attention span also improved in some children. Hyperactivity and aggressive behaviour were reduced in other children and five children were able to attend mainstream classes at school for the first time. Behavioural data, recorded by the teachers and parents, showed significant improvements in most cases. [Clinical Efficacy of Upper Cervical Versus Full Spine Adjustment on Children with Autism ](https://chiro.org/research/ABSTRACTS/Clinical_Efficacy_of_Upper_Cervical.shtml) WFC'S 7th Biennial Congress Conference Proceedings MAY 1-3, 2003, 7th Ed: 328-9 Children with autism are presented with multiple categories of clinical pictures that affect their social, sensory, speech, and physical development. In addition to chiropractic care, parents of autistic children seek all possible therapies available. In this study, the clinical outcome of chiropractic care showed higher efficacy of upper cervical adjustment when compared to full spine adjustment in autistic children. [A Case Study of a Five Year Old Male with Autism/Pervasive Development Disorder who Improved Remarkably and Quickly with Chiropractic Treatment](https://chiro.org/research/ABSTRACTS/A_Case_Study_of_a_Five_Year_Old.shtml) Proceedings of the World Federation of Chiropractic Congress 2001 (May); 6: 313 Extraordinary progress was noted in the patient by all involved parties. The subjective and objective monitoring system revealed a 96% overall improvement after 2 weeks of treatment. A 102% overall improvement was revealed on a 3.5 year follow-up, the mother adding that the child appeared near normal. This progress is vastly superior to typical progress following standard medical treatment. [Autism, Asthma, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Strabismus, and Illness Susceptibility: A Case Study in Chiropractic Management](https://chiro.org/research/FULL/Autism_Asthma_Irritable_Bowel_Syndrome.html) Todays Chiropractic 1998; 27 (5): 32-47 Pathologies of organic origin are commonly thought to be the exclusive realm of medical treatment and not part of the mainstay of chiropractic care. The clinical observations of a patient presenting with autism, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, strabismus, and illness susceptibility are reported. Alleviation of symptoms is seen subsequent to corrections of abnormal biomechanical function of the occipito-atlanto-axial complex. A relationship between biomechanical faults in the upper cervical spine and the manifestation of abnormal central neurophysiological processing is suggested as the genesis of this patient's symptomatology.
