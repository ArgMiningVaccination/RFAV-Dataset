When the Council adopted Directive 87/22/EEcl, and specifically Artlc!e 5 thereof, It Instructed the Commission to present It with \"proposals for Regulations to harmonize, along the lines of Directive 75/319/EEC, the conditions for authorizing the manufacture and placing on the market of the proprietary medicinal products excluded by Article 34 of Directive 73/319/EEc2 and of the veterinary medicinal products referred to In Article 2(2) of Directive 81/851/EECJ\". 2. Three of the four kinds of medicines for human use which were provisionally excluded In 1975 have recently been Incorporated Into Community pharmaceutical legislation, namely: OJ OJ OJ OJ OJ OJ OJ Immunological medicinal products by Directive 89/342/EEc4, radio-pharmaceuticals by Directive 89/343/EEC5 and medicinal products derived from human blood by Directive 89/381/EEc6. In the veterinary field, a proposal for a Directive on Immunological medicinal products was transmitted to the Council In January 19897. It has proved more difficult to harmonize legislation on homeopathic medicinal products because of the conflicting conceptions of medicine Involved. No L 15 17 . 1 . 1987 p.38.

While homeopathic medicine has traditionally been recognized In some Member States, It has merely been tolerated In others or even Ignored by orthodox medicine altogether. Nonetheless, homeopathy has been practised In Europe for more than two centuries and has become Increasingly popular with the public In the last decade or so with the rise In \"natural\" therapies and alternative medicine. 4. It Is not for the Commission to take sides for or against a particular style of medical practice. The aim should be rather, in the 1 lght of legislative experience In some of the Member States, to provide European consumers with safeguards about the Quality and safety of the homeopathic medicines currently available In ali Community countries. Proof of therapeutic efficacy cannot b~ obtained by generally accepted scientific methods or, at the !east, Is highly contentious. 5. Whether recognized or simply tolerated, homeopathic remedies represent a small but not Insignificant share of the pharmaceuticals market, of the order of half a bl II lon {500 000 000) ECU. Trade between Member States Is Impeded by the differences In regulation and practice at national level. The proposals the Commission Is now presenting to the Council, on homeopathic medicinal products for human and for veterinary use, are Intended to further the completion of the Internal market In the pharmaceuticals sector as provided for In the 1985 White Paper programme. -4 - II. ALTERNATiVE REMEDIES IN EUROPE 6, In 1987 the Commission asked the Belgian Consumers' Association to carry out a study on the market for alternative medicine among European consumers. This study, written by G. Sermus, covers seven Community countries {B~Iglum, Denmark, Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands, United Kingdom) as well as Finland and Switzerland. It shows that a considerable proportion of the population (from 18% to 75% depending on country) makes use of alternative therapies. Homeopathy Is the principal method among them, well ahead of acupuncture and manipulations such as chiropractic, osteopathy and various types of massage. Then come herbal remedies, followed by what one might ca II \"paranorma I\" methods, IncludIng myst I ca I and religious approaches. Finally the author lists what he classifies as fringe methods (In Europe) such as lrldology, anthroposophy, \"biomedicine\", aroma therapy, cell therapy and hypnotherapy. The author notes that It Is generally adults between the ages of 40 and 60 with a high level of education who make most use of alternative medicine. 7. These diverse therapies have little In common except being almost uniformly rejected by science as lacking a rational basis. Whereas conventional or allopathic medicine has made considerable progress through advances In biology, pharmacology and surgical techniques, the various forms of alternative medicine generally adopt an empirical approach backed by what are often obscure explanations. But conventional medicine Itself does not meet alI the expectations of patients with certain chronic or supposedly \"Incurable\" diseases. Furthermore, patients are often put off by the Impersonal and highly technological nature of modern medicine. The alternative medicines, on the other hand, tend to be holistic In the sense that they look at the person as a whole and encourage the patient to participate In the healing process. Although alternative medicine can be sincere In approach and rest on established traditions, It must be admitted that a degree of opportunism has developed to exploit recent fashions, even to the extent of combining methods that are Incompatible. -5 - 8. Homeopathic remedies represent by far the most Important type of alternative medicines used In Europe. For our present purposes, plant-based medicinal products wll I be considered as belonging to the allopathic or conventional tradition; medicinal herbs are In fact the origin of many modern medicines, either by extraction or by synthesis, although the action of the plant as a whole may be poorly understood. While allopath:/ treats a condition by tackling the causes or, at second-best, the symptoms, homeopathy Is based on the principle of similarity- like cures like-and extreme dilutions. The theory was developed by Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843) and consists of trying to cure the patient by administering very small doses of a substance which, In a healthy Individual, would produce similar symptoms to those observed In the patient. This theory has evolved Into various opposing schools: complexlsts, pluralists \"biomedicine\" (following Dr Schussler), which are more widespread In Germany than In the rest of the Community, make frequent use of homeopathic remedies while being based on other Ideas. 9. When the Community's pharmaceuticals directives were being transposed Into German law In the \"Arznelmlttelgesetz 1976\", a wide-ranging debate took place about the position of alternative remedies. The quality of homeopathic and anthroposophlc medicines Is standardized In a separate official pharmacopoeia (Hom5opathlsches Arznelbuch- HAB); such medicinal products are evaluated by special committees of the Federal Health Office (Bundesgesundheltsamt- BGA). France also has a well-established homeopathic tradition, with special authorization procedures and the Inclusion of monographs on homeopathic preparations and 'mother tinctures' or stocks In the French I~ editions VI I I and X1. Homeopathic m~dlcinal products are also mant oneo, albeit in much less detail, In the pharmaceutical legls:e< on of Belgium, Drinmark, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom ana Ire! . Th~~e c<,tmtrles, as wei as Italy and Portugal, ar~ w~lting to see what acnon the Community will talce bef;;;,r'= review ng their own lf,g s I at I on. - 6 - Ill. CONSULTATIONS AT COMMUNITY LEVEL 10. In the period since 1987, the Commission has put three successive preliminary drafts of a Directive on homeopathic medicinal products to the Pharmaceuticals Committee, which Is composed of representatives of the Uember States. The reaction to these drafts varied widely according to the different national positions, from official recognition to outright rejection. Since homeopathic medicines are available on all the national markets, there have been suggestions that they be classified as articles for household consumption rather than as medicines. However, this does not seem consistent either with the Community definition of medicinal products or with the Instructions given by the Council. While some convergence of views seems possible In the case of traditional homeopathic medicines, the same cannot be said of anthroposophlcal products, nor of aspects felt to carry too much risk (preparations for Injection, for example) or considered hardly compatible with the basic principles of homoeopathy (encouragement of self-medication). 11. The preliminary draft Directive on homeopathic medicinal products for human use was distributed widely through several European organizations representing professionals In the field: the pharmaceuticals Industry (EFPIA), homeopathic and anthroposophlc laboratories, the Association of EEC pharmacists and mutual pharmacies, and homoeopaths and anthroposophlcal practitioners. The overall reaction was positive, since the draft text Introduced greater legal security while eliminating various sharp practices which damage the reputation of serious practitioners. At the request of the Commission, the Consumers' Consultative Committee Issued an opinion on 16 February 1989; this was favourable, and was accompanied by complete and detailed reference documentation. In addition to this, an International workshop en homeopathic medicines was held In Berlin on 2 and 3 February 1989 at the Invitation of the Federal Health Office; 11 health ministries of European countries were represented, as we!! as the Commission. Most of the ji)artlclpants met again In Strasbourg on 17 and 18 May at the Invitation of the Secretary of the European rnarmaoopsela. - 7 - 12. Several prel lmlnary drafts of a Directive on medicinal products for veterinary use have been submitted to the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products. Despite the great differences between countries, most members of the Committee underlined the need to Improve standards of quality and safety for this category of medicines, which are being used more and more. The competant authorities would also like to el lmlnate a number of abuses In the field, In particular the sale of medicines described as homeopathic for collectively treating livestock as part of specific medications for which a therapeutic effect has not been shown. IV. THE QUALITY OF HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINES 13. Homeopathic medicinal products are defined primarily by the way they are made up, as described In the European Pharmacopoeia If It Is extended to Include homeopathy or, If not, In national pharmacopoeias (currently those of France and Germany). This \"objective\" method of definition, which Is the one adopted In the German legislation, has the advantage of not taking sides In the argument over the philosophy or rational basis of homeopathy or other traditions using the same products, such as Is often the case for anthroposophy. Homeopathic medicines should be clearly Identifiable as such for the general public, by means of a special legend on the label, so that there can be no confusion between these, more controversial, homeopathic products and orthodox medicines. The general approach of Community pharmaceutical legislation Is followed In that the proposals cover only medicines which are widely distributed, I.e. prepared Industrially and thus a major potential risk for the public, In particular by being sold In Intra-Community trade. This would not affect In any way the right to prescribe or prepare other alternative therapies In Individual cases according to magistral or officinal formulae, within the bounds of current national legislation. - 8 - 14. The wide distribution of Industrially prepared homeopathic medicines means that the first priority must be to harmonize the manufacture and monitoring of them. Apart from having to comply with the European Pharmacopoeia or, If not covered by It, the existing official pharmacopoeias, homeopathic medicines will become subject to all the Community rules safeguarding the quality of medicinal products manufactured In and Imported/exported to or from the Community. A consequence Is that the authorization to manufacture, export or Import such products wll I be conditional on possession of suitable premises and equipment. All raw materials and each batch manufactured will have to be monitored by a qualified person, who will Issue a properly registered certificate of conformity. The rules of good manufacturing practice (GMP) wl II become mandatory, which Is particularly Important In the case of highly dl luted products. Establishments wll I also become subject to regular monitoring by pharmaceuticals Inspectors. The competent authorities In the Member States will be required to exchange Inspection reports and other data relevant to safeguarding the quality and safety of homeopathic medicines. V. PLACEMENT OF HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINES ON THE MARKET 15. Harmonizing the terms on which homeopathic medicines are to receive market authorization poses more complicated problems. Some Member States, while accepting that it Is useful to ensure the quality of homeopathic products, do not want to give them official status and yet are prepared to admit products legally sold In other Member states, within certain constraints. On the other hand, where a Member state wishes to regulate the marketing of homeopathic medicines It wl II have a choice between two different regimes. -9 - 16. Tha first of these, full harmonization, consists of a slmpl !fled registration procedure applicable to medicinal products which, without therapeutic claims being made, are put up In pharmaceutical forms and at dilutions that carry no risk. Such medicines, sold under their common name and bearing a fully harmonized label I ing, wl 11 usually be prescribed by a practitioner qualified according to the specific features of the case under treatment. Medicines of this type will be considered to belong to the homeopathic tradition and their therapeutic effect Is to be assessed In terms of that tradition. Since some of the Information would be repetitive, It wl II be possible to combine dossiers to cover a series of like preparations. 17. The other, and more rigorous, regime cannot be entirely harmonized at this juncture. For homeopathic medicines other than those qualifying for the simplified registration procedure, proof of therapeutic effect balanced against potential risks wl II have to be provided. Member States will apply either the ordinary rules on market authorization, especially criteria of efficacy and safety, or special rules for homeopathic preparations. In this second case, these special rules will have to be notified to the Commission with a view to later harmonization. VI. CONCLUSIONS 18. By 1993, with the entry Into effect of the Directives, homeopathic medicines sold In the Community will all have to meet the same high quality standards. First-time appl lcatlons for registration or authorization will be examined under the terms of the Directives. Experience with Implementation wll I lead to a greater convergence of practice as between Member States despite the present wide differences. -10 - In accordance with Articles Sa and 8c of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, the Commission calls on the Member States to take the necessary steps to comply with the proposals presented here by 1 January 1993. 19. The Commission has given due consideration to the requirements of Article 8c of the Treaty and has concluded that no special provisions are needed In this case. The commission has also looked at the matter of the high level of protection for health, safety, the environment and consumers required by the third paragraph of Article 100a. This review was conducted after consulting concerned parties and after analysing the Inherent risks In this area, given current technical capacity within European Industry. The proposals take full account of these factors, In the light of the underlying alms of the Treaty. ~-~---~--~----~------------------ No C 108/10 Official Journal of the European Communities l. 5. 90 II (Preparatory Acts) COMMISSION Proposal for a Council Directive widening the scope of Directives 65/65/EEC and 75/319/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on medicinal products and laying down additional provisions on homeopathic medicinal products COM(90) 72 final-SYN 251 (Submitted by the Commission on 23 March 1990) (90/C 108/05) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, In cooperation with the European Parliament, Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee, Whereas differences currently ex1stmg between the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in the Member States may hinder trade in homeo\u00ad pathic medicinal products within the Community; Whereas the essential aim of any rules governing the production, distribution and use of medicinal products must be to safeguard public health; Whereas the proVISIOns of Council Directive 65/65/EEC (') and the Second Directive 75/319/EEC ('), as last amended by Directive 891341/EEC ('), are not always appropriate for homeo\u00ad pathic medicinal products; Whereas homeopathic medicine is officially recognized in certain Member States but is only tolerated in other Member States; whereas, therefore, it is appropriate to recognize certain national homeopathic traditions without imposing them throughout the Community; (') OJ No 22, 9. 2. 1965, p. 369/65.

White Paper on completing the Internal market; Improvement of protection of public health; Instructions from the Councl I to Include in Community legislation all Industrially produced medicinal products. 2. Features of the businesses concerned The market for homeopathic medicines Is relatively restricted (2% of the market for pharmaceuticals). Industrial preparation of homeopathic medicines Is carried out by about 15 Community companies which are disadvantaged by present legislation and the lack of legal certainty for their activities In some Member States where homeopathy Is not recognized. Small manufacturing or dl Iutton runs produced by local homeopathic, dispensing pharmacies are not affected by the proposals.
