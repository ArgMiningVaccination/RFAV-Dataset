While the markets have behaved erratically leading to considerable loss of investor money, there has been a liquidity crisis in the market which is leading to many financial companies rethinking on their existing products and schemes. Last week the biggest news that came in was that of Franklin Templeton, one of the earliest global financial companies to launch operations in India, to take the inevitable and unprecedented decision of closing down six of its high performing fixed income and credit risk funds in its India unit with a total AUM of over ` 30,000 crore. Ostensibly, the decision came in because of a lack of liquidity in the bond market. It is also true that India's debt market has been feeling the pinch ever since the COVID-19 pandemic started and created a liquidity crisis as people stayed home. While this is the first big fund house to withdraw major schemes from the market, the move is certain to prompt other big fund houses to follow suit and withdraw schemes from the market because of lack of liquidity. Obviously, this will make matters worse and aggravate the situation as liquidity is not expected to improve in the market or at least until the lockdown is lifted and normalcy returns to the markets. This will considerably dent investor confidence and narrow down options for investors, especially in the debt market. Most people are hoping that things will start getting normal from May-June, if, at all, the government lifts the lockdown and people start getting back to their regular routines. However, things are still grim on the COVID-19 front and it is highly possible that the lockdown will either get extended nationwide or at least in several pockets in various states, which means that things will not return to normal till coronavirus infection cases start going on a decline noticeably. So a realistic estimate would be to look at June-July for normalcy to return to the markets when, hopefully, liquidity will start improving. But thankfully, all is not lost at the stock markets at least. The markets have been behaving quite erratically of late, losing most of the time and experiencing moderate gains from time to time. Ever since the pandemic set in, the Sensex and the Nifty have dropped by an average of about 30 per cent, which, though a huge loss, is not the maximum Indian investors have seen. Experts feel that Indian investors, at least a large number of them, have seen larger losses when the Sensex had tanked by a larger amount. This includes the Harshad Mehta scam, the dot com bubble burst and the Ketan Parekh episodes when the markets had tanked by around 50 per cent. If the market had dropped by a similar amount now, the Sensex ideally should have come down to around the 17,000-18,000 level. The fact that the Sensex is still ruling at around 31,000 despite the repeated falls shows that the markets are still pretty resilient as compared to their historical past and can withstand these developments and pressures. If things proceed as expected, we should see the Sensex getting back to the 35,000-36,000 level by October. The other good news is that Foreign Portfolio Investors who had exited the market couple of months ago, have started making inroads into the Indian markets again. This should give a booster shot to Indian investors and bring back investor confidence. As and when the government opens up various sectors and the lockdown is lifted gradually, the market is expected to become more resilient and bring in gains for investors. The next few weeks would be defining for Indian investors and would determine how the markets behave and what happens to investors' money. The government has come out twice in the last one month to provide a booster package to lift sentiments. It is expected to further announce packages for investors and the economy which will bring in good tidings for all. In the meantime it would make sense to stay invested in the markets as profit booking in these times could bring in less than expected results. Please stay safe.

Amid the pandemic, the investors are surely befuddled, and it is important to ingrain the concept of SIP and STP in such situations. Investors should understand that they must not stop the ongoing strategies as volatility is the best friend of these strategies in the long run. Suvashree Majumdar , Kolkata Importance Of Asset Allocation In The Turbulent Times Kshitija's column on asset allocation and how it might help us sail through turbulent times is an interesting article. Naresh Kumar , Mumbai Time To Turn Wounds Into Wisdom To remain invested is the need of the hour. The unstable environment might come as a shock, but one must keep calm and cut the expenses as much as possible, and increase the savings rate. I liked how this article explained the strategy by taking the example of 2008 crisis, where those who stayed invested gained in the long run. Arun Jaiswal , Mumbai Follow Guidelines, Ensure Safety I have been following Outlook Money for several years now, and I am glad how this time they focused on the COVID-19 issue and answered the queries of the insurers regarding health and travel insurance. Sarita Viswanath , Chennai Talk Back10 Outlook Money May 2020 www.outlookmoney.com 10 Outlook Money May 2020 www.outlookmoney.comManaging Portfolio During Volatility This article has an interesting approach. When we are all grappling with such uncertainty, especially in the medical domain, it is important for all of us to relook at our portfolios and emergency funds. I liked how the author explained in a detailed stepwise pattern, and ended with an optimistic frame, and the key words being patience and discipline. Sudip Kumar Mondal , Kolkata Not A Comforting Message I got to understand and learn a lot from Manish Tewari's speech in the Outlook Money Conclave. He has unveiled several factors which remain unnoticed, and the ramifications are not easily understood by the common people. I appreciate how he focused on the fall of private consumption, manufacturing growth and agricultural credit. As we all are aware of the unemployment reaching its peak, I had a great time reading about all other parameters that do not send a comforting message. Kuheli Adhikari , DelhiGaining An Institutional Face I found this article on mutual funds very intriguing. How India has developed over the years under this category was very informative. I hope to read more of such articles. Srijan Singh , Mumbai Digitisation Can Improve Insurance Penetration This article spoke what many of us feel nowadays with digitisation gradually becoming a necessity and a way of living a better life. It will surely make a better tomorrow. Coming to the insurance category, without any doubt digitisation has simplified it and bought significant efficiency into the insurance business. Mahima Jain , New DelhiAT1 Bonds Write-Off Exposes Gaps The article focusing on the Yes Bank crisis was very informative. Many depositors were baffled and had no access to information that was behind this decision. I would like to thank Outlook Money for highlighting this issue with sound investigative research. Ashish Mishra, Bangalore My Plan With uncertainties all over the globe, it is profoundly important for all of us to take financial discipline seriously. This article is wonderfully weaved, giving us a picture of reality focusing on dedicated SIPs and health insurance covers to mitigate the risk of any future uncertainties. People have a hard time trying to figure out their financial roadmap, and to have a strong financial commitment. And it is absolutely necessary to start getting financial advice from an early age, so that down the line, we do not feel helpless. Akash Gupta , Kolkata COVID-19: Where Do We Go? The article of Farzana Suri was full of positive notes especially when things are going downhill. I always look forward to articles like these, and hoping to see more. Samayata Bhansali , Mumbai Talk Back12 Outlook Money May 2020 www.outlookmoney.comQueries 12 Outlook Money May 2020 www.outlookmoney.comSWAPNIL BHANDARKAR swapnil.bhandarkar@gmail.com My mother is a 62 years old housewife. She has `10 lakh as savings which we want to invest with the intention to give her a monthly stable income. Which scheme would you recommend and what are the pros and cons of each scheme? The following schemes are Senior Citizen Savings Scheme, Systematic Withdrawal Plan, Annuity Plan from some insurance companies like Tata AIA or HDFC Life. The Senior Citizen Saving Scheme (SCSS) comes with the highest safety with an interest rate of 8.6 per cent (January to March 2020). Investments are eligible for deductions under Section 80C limit. It gives a stable income in the form of interest and gets directly credited into the bank account of the depositor. SCSS comes with a fairly medium to long tenure of five years, extendable for another three years. It is advisable to be watchful on factors like interest, which is taxable and is paid quarterly. Given Various Pros And Cons Of Senior Citizen Saving Schemes your information, an investment limit of `15 lakh, might not be a concern. Premature withdrawals are permitted only after the first year but with penalties at the rate of 1.5 per cent before two years and thereafter before maturity. Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) from mutual funds has the potential of higher returns and is a good choice for those investors with more risk appetite. SWP from a debt mutual fund can give a reasonable visibility of regular cashflows. Always choose the monthly withdrawal percentage a bit lesser than the expected yield to maturity. Accrual based funds are highly suggested for SWPs. As far as the taxation is concerned, gains on withdrawals up to three years would be as per the marginal tax slab of the individual. Annuity plans come with the comfort of income stability but the returns are below average in most cases, hence could be preferred less. Sriram B.K.R, Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services I want to invest for 12 months in liquid funds instead of recurring deposits as I will be requiring funds after a year. I would like to know about the tax implication and which are the best liquid funds available? Liquid funds come under the debt category. Gains realised within three years are considered as short-term and would be taxed as per the individual's marginal tax slab rates. Some names that you can consider are, Tata Liquid fund, Axis Liquid fund and Sundaram Money fund. Sriram B.K.R, Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial ServicesM P SINGH, singh_mp65@rediffmail.com14 Outlook Money May 2020 www.outlookmoney.comQueries 14 Outlook Money May 2020 www.outlookmoney.com SRIKANTH REDDY srikanthr2908@gmail.com I am an NRI and planning to invest for my child's education, who is right now four months old. I would like you to help me with the following queries. How much do I need to invest monthly or yearly to accumulate an amount of ` 35 lakh by the time my son turns 15 years ? Do I need to pay a tax on ` 35 lakh? If yes, how much would it be? We will be requiring a little more information on your risk appetite whether it is low, average or aggressive? If the corpus is for your child's education, we would like to know whether you are planning it in India or any other country? What type of instruments are you looking at ? With all the available information I would say that for reaching `35 lakh in 14.7 years, and assuming that you have a moderate risk; with investments in equity-oriented mutual funds, you need to invest `7,700 per month. I am also assuming your investments are growing at an expected rate of 12 per cent per annum. If you expect the investment to grow at 15 per cent per annum, then the investment could be around Rs 6,000 per month. Yes. As per current tax laws, long term capital gains from equity-oriented investments (those held for more than 12 months) are taxed at the rate of 10 per cent on gains beyond `1 lakh per annum. If you are doing a systematic investment, then 12 months should be counted for each instalment (including the last one) for long-term. Answering your third question, you need to reconsider the future amount if it is for higher education. The education inflation grows at higher teen digits and any lower assumption on base cost or on the inflation might end up creating a big shortfall. Sriram B.K.R, Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial ServicesSARABJEET SINGH iamsarabjeetsingh@gmail.com I am 32 years old and doing an investment in PPF of 1 lakh per annum (`3 lakh till now), `50,000 per annum in NPS (` 50,000 till now), and ` 10,000 in ELSS (` 1 lakh till now). How much corpus I will accumulate and need to accumulate more to retire at the age of 60? What other investments can I do to accumulate good corpus for my child's education? If your existing investments continue in the same pattern every year, it is expected to grow. In case of PPF it will grow to around `1.01 crore (at an expected rate of interest of 7.9 per cent per annum, throughout), each investment comes with a lock-in period of 15 years. In case of NPS it will grow to around `74 lakh (at an expected CAGR of 10 per cent per annum). Investments come with a lock-in period till 60 years of age. In case of ELSS it will grow to around `3.5 crore (at an expected CAGR of 14 per cent per annum), each investment comes with a lock- in period of three years. This sums it up to around `5.25 crore. We would strongly suggest you to start a separate SIP (systematic investment plan) for your child's future education in an equity mutual fund scheme. You can calculate taking some real-time costs and the inflationary trends to arrive at a ball-park figure, else please contact a financial advisor for assistance. Sriram B.K.R, Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Serviceswww.outlookmoney.com May 2020 Outlook Money 15 www.outlookmoney.com May 2020 Outlook Money 15Nobody saw it coming. Yes. Franklin Templeton's decision to wrap up six of its major debt schemes on April 23, has created ripples in the world of finance. Post the event, the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), the industry's apex body is all set to extend support to lakhs to investors who are caught in a state of flux. In a statement issued, AMFI states, \" A majority of income- oriented debt schemes have invested in superior credit quality securities and have appropriate liquidity to ensure normal operations. AMFI strongly recommends that investors continue to focus on their investment goals, consult financial advisors and not get side-tracked by an isolated event in a few schemes of a single fund company. \" Commenting on the latest development of the asset management company, AMFI states that the action is limited to only six specific income- oriented debt schemes managed by Franklin Templeton. Further, the Assets Under Management (AUM) of these six schemes constitute less than 1.4 per cent of the Indian Mutual Fund Industry's aggregate AUM as on March 31, 2020. In light of the above, sharing his views Nilesh Shah, Chairman, AMFI says, \"The mutual funds industry remains fully committed to investor interests and there is no need for them to panic and redeem their investments. The industry continues to remain robust like in 2008 sub-prime crisis or 2013 taper tantrum crisis. \" \"Sebi regulations allow mutual funds schemes to borrow up to 20 per cent of their assets to meet liquidity needs for redemption or dividend pay-out. \" Himali Patel AMFI Urges Stockholders To Continue Investing India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) has revised its FY21 gross domestic product (GDP) growth further down to 1.9 per cent from its earlier estimate of 3.6 per cent published on March 30, 2020. This will be the lowest GDP growth in the last 29 years and is based on the assumption that the partial lockdown will continue till mid-May 2020. Ind-Ra's estimates suggested that GDP may come back to the 4QFY20 level only by 3QFY21, anticipating resumption of normal economic activities during 2QFY21 and festive demand during 3QFY21. However, if the lockdown continues beyond mid May 2020 (almost as anticipated) and a gradual recovery takes root only from end of June 2020, GDP growth may slip further to negative 2.1 per cent, lowest in the last 41 years. The Ind-Ra research report said the proactive intervention of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) notwithstanding the spill over impact of COVID-19 has percolated into the financial markets as well, choking the credit channels and raising the risk aversion. The RBI announced its seventh bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement of FY20 on March 27, 2020. Although the policy focused on (i) the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps), (ii) cutting the cash reserve ratio by 100 bps to three per cent, (iii) announcing targeted long-term repo operations Targeted Long-Term Repo Operations (TLTRO) worth ` 1 lakh crore, were primarily focused on easing the tight monetary conditions building up in the economy, the financial market reacted otherwise. Ind-Ra's retail inflation estimate for FY21 is 3.6 per cent. Retail inflation had breached the RBI's upper bound of six per cent in December 2019 and peaked in January 2020, before the prices of vegetables, fruits and petroleum brought it down to 5.9 per cent in March 2020. As the threat to headline inflation has receded lately due to (i) adequate buffer stocks in cereals, (ii) good rabi harvest, (iii) record decline in global crude prices and (iv) low pricing power of firms, even the RBI now expects the retail inflation to fall to 2.7 per cent in 3QFY21 and 2.4 per cent in 4QFY21.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a relief package worth ` 1.70 lakh crore, which would take care of farmers, landless labourers and make arrangements for free distribution of food articles for poor people affected by the lockdown. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) followed suit with a bigger package of `3.77 lakh crore. RBI came out with yet another Relief Package 2.0 in the second week of April, which was aimed at deepening the availability of credit from banks through additional Targeted Long-Term Repo Operations (TLTRO) worth ` 50,000 crore with a focus on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and Non- Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs). Under this relief package SMEs and other corporate entities will be benefited in the form of repayment of loan for a period of three months. It also announced reduction in the rate of interest for the industrial and banking sector. However, amid all these pckages, one of the most important stake-holder that was forgotten was the investor. Following the outbreak equity markets have taken a huge beating. Markets have dipped in excess of 30 per cent. It is the investing community that provides large chunk of risk capital to the Industry and plays a significant role in the development of the economy. This community also needs support in the form of some soothing announcement from the Ministry of Finance (MoF) to come back into action.

Farm Economy: With the Rabi harvest ready, farm supply chains and markets have to work, so that farmers can reach their produce to the buying centers and get a fair value for their labour. Similarly with the Kharif sowing season starting, it is critical that farmers have credit, inputs and labour available to complete the sowing on time. This is largely in the hands of the state governments 2. SMEs/MSMEs: Though there is good systemic liquidity with daily money market liquidity of more than ` 4 lakh crore, SMEs and MSMEs who have low cash cushions and staying power are facing an existential crisis. Like in the US, it is critical to enhance the credit available to these segments and to give deferrals to them on repayments. These are the largest employers after agriculture and construction industry, and nearly 1/4th of them will go bankrupt unless funds are made available to them urgently 3. Unemployment grants to informal workers out of jobs: This is the largest segment of bread winners after farmers and they have been facing a huge hardship. Direct transfers of survival grants should be made into their accounts to help them tide over the lockdown period 4. Support to troubled sectors like airports, aviation, hotels and restaurants, retailers and malls, real estate, logistics, NBFCs, micro finance and automobile value chain players facing acute losses due to the lock down needs to be announced 5. Tax rate cuts in GST to lower prices and boost consumption are required 6. For all those who have lost their jobs, some kind of an unemployment insurance package should be rolled out to help them tide over the next few monthssupports investor community and is relevant in the falling interest rate regime. The government needs to keep in mind that in the low interest rate regime, it is only the capital market, which has the ability to attract savings and can boost the risk capital. If it fails to do so, it will not only damage itself but will also badly impact the highly ambitious disinvestment programme. Ajay Bagga, a Private Investor, feels, \"Fiscal stimulus, action by RBI to manage the market stability and liquidity and sector-focused stimulus measures will help revive the real economy and corporate cash flows. For the markets, a liberalisation of the investment tax regime with lower STT, abolition of the Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax and reduction of the Short Term Capital Gains (STCG) tax along with holding periods should be introduced to boost sentiments. \" Echoing similar views, Archana Khosla-Burman, Founder Partner, Vertices Partners, says, \"The government could reduce the tax burden on investors by temporarily removing the tax on share buyback and LTCG. This could provide some relief and exemptions in these times of turmoil caused by the continuous bleeding in the stock markets. The removal of the buyback tax will prompt more companies to announce buybacks, which could help provide floor to the share prices. Further, the removal of LTCG tax will provide a good booster, as shares of most of the companies are trading low. Along with the abolition of LTCG, government may also consider reduction of Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) from its current rate\" . The suggestion to removal of buyback tax is in line with the recent step taken by the Commerce Ministry to tweak the rules for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) by certain neighbouring countries. The move is to check the hostile and predatory takeover bids by foreign investors, when the stock prices have taken a severe beating in the domestic markets. Additionally, measures to boost industrial production and manufacturing are also required to bring back investor confidence. \"Corporate earnings visibility and growth are the fundamental bedrock of the markets. Measures to revitalise the production sectors in the concerted efforts to revive domestic savings. Yet the key monitorable with respect to investor sentiment stays the spread of the virus on one hand, and the extent of lockdown and its impact on the economy on the other. The policy response on both these fronts will determine the extent of damage to the economy and hence cuts to corporate earnings. And this will continue to shape sentiment in the near term. The prolonged lockdown and disturbance in industrial production and business activity could take a toll on companies, especially the SMEs. Munot feels the big concern is that the economic distress caused by the lockdown could result in several smaller businesses failing to survive and a huge spike in unemployment. This will put the financial system at a heightened risk, which in turn will adversely affect the economic activity, thus leading to a vicious cycle. Munot says, \"Just when after several years of clean- up the financial system finally looked ready to support growth, we cannot afford this. It is therefore imperative that the policy makers are aggressive and proactive in not just controlling the virus but also mitigating the economy will be positive for cash flows and sentiments and will boost the investor confidence, \" Bagga explains. Of course, some measures have been taken, which should bring in some cheer, says Navneet Munot, ED and CIO, SBI MF. \"We are a country deficient in risk capital. With domestic savings rate steadily declining and at multi-year lows now, we have stayed heavily dependent on foreign capital. However, FPIs pulled out nearly $15 billion from the Indian financial markets in March, their highest ever outflow, amidst heightened global risk-aversion. Recent moves such as increasing FPI limit to 15 per cent in corporate bonds and opening up certain government securities under the fully accessible route are welcome steps. Statutory FPI limits of Indian companies having been increased to the sectoral foreign investment limit effective April 1, 2020. This should help increase India's weight in MSCI EM equity index, \" he explains. It is not that the government has not taken steps at all that can help the economy. But these are all good medium-term measures as they may not be of much help immediately.

Support to troubled sectors like airports, aviation, hotels and restaurants, retailers and malls, real estate, logistics, NBFCs, micro finance and automobile value chain players facing acute losses due to the lock down needs to be announced 5. Tax rate cuts in GST to lower prices and boost consumption are required 6. For all those who have lost their jobs, some kind of an unemployment insurance package should be rolled out to help them tide over the next few monthssupports investor community and is relevant in the falling interest rate regime. The government needs to keep in mind that in the low interest rate regime, it is only the capital market, which has the ability to attract savings and can boost the risk capital. If it fails to do so, it will not only damage itself but will also badly impact the highly ambitious disinvestment programme. Ajay Bagga, a Private Investor, feels, \"Fiscal stimulus, action by RBI to manage the market stability and liquidity and sector-focused stimulus measures will help revive the real economy and corporate cash flows. For the markets, a liberalisation of the investment tax regime with lower STT, abolition of the Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax and reduction of the Short Term Capital Gains (STCG) tax along with holding periods should be introduced to boost sentiments. \" Echoing similar views, Archana Khosla-Burman, Founder Partner, Vertices Partners, says, \"The government could reduce the tax burden on investors by temporarily removing the tax on share buyback and LTCG. This could provide some relief and exemptions in these times of turmoil caused by the continuous bleeding in the stock markets. The removal of the buyback tax will prompt more companies to announce buybacks, which could help provide floor to the share prices. Further, the removal of LTCG tax will provide a good booster, as shares of most of the companies are trading low. Along with the abolition of LTCG, government may also consider reduction of Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) from its current rate\" . The suggestion to removal of buyback tax is in line with the recent step taken by the Commerce Ministry to tweak the rules for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) by certain neighbouring countries. The move is to check the hostile and predatory takeover bids by foreign investors, when the stock prices have taken a severe beating in the domestic markets. Additionally, measures to boost industrial production and manufacturing are also required to bring back investor confidence. \"Corporate earnings visibility and growth are the fundamental bedrock of the markets. Measures to revitalise the production sectors in the concerted efforts to revive domestic savings. Yet the key monitorable with respect to investor sentiment stays the spread of the virus on one hand, and the extent of lockdown and its impact on the economy on the other. The policy response on both these fronts will determine the extent of damage to the economy and hence cuts to corporate earnings. And this will continue to shape sentiment in the near term. The prolonged lockdown and disturbance in industrial production and business activity could take a toll on companies, especially the SMEs. Munot feels the big concern is that the economic distress caused by the lockdown could result in several smaller businesses failing to survive and a huge spike in unemployment. This will put the financial system at a heightened risk, which in turn will adversely affect the economic activity, thus leading to a vicious cycle. Munot says, \"Just when after several years of clean- up the financial system finally looked ready to support growth, we cannot afford this. It is therefore imperative that the policy makers are aggressive and proactive in not just controlling the virus but also mitigating the economy will be positive for cash flows and sentiments and will boost the investor confidence, \" Bagga explains. Of course, some measures have been taken, which should bring in some cheer, says Navneet Munot, ED and CIO, SBI MF. \"We are a country deficient in risk capital. With domestic savings rate steadily declining and at multi-year lows now, we have stayed heavily dependent on foreign capital. However, FPIs pulled out nearly $15 billion from the Indian financial markets in March, their highest ever outflow, amidst heightened global risk-aversion. Recent moves such as increasing FPI limit to 15 per cent in corporate bonds and opening up certain government securities under the fully accessible route are welcome steps. Statutory FPI limits of Indian companies having been increased to the sectoral foreign investment limit effective April 1, 2020. This should help increase India's weight in MSCI EM equity index, \" he explains. It is not that the government has not taken steps at all that can help the economy. But these are all good medium-term measures as they may not be of much help immediately.

Signs that policy makers are ahead of the curve on both fiscal and monetary fronts will be critical in stabilising financial markets. There will be worries on debt but it is important to note that debt to GDP typically rises in any crisis. \" As growth rate falls near interest rates, debt burden will rise anyway. Taking the economy out of trouble with the growth denominator taking care of the ratio is therefore the only way to go. The RBI however must absorb government supply to keep yields down. While this may lead to concerns around our ratings and the currency, at a time when most countries are doing the same, the relative pressure will be less severe. Munot feels that the government's thrust over the past few years has been to revive investment activity to create jobs and in turn support consumption sustainably. A lot of ground work has been done in this regard like formalisation of the economy through crackdown on black economy and reforms in the form of GST, a continuous thrust on lowering cost of capital, improvement in ease of doing business, recent corporate tax cuts, among others. The current crisis will lead to unprecedented global stimulus. With monetary policy having reached its limit globally, fiscal policy will do the heavy lifting, which should be positive for global infrastructure and investment activity. At the same time, the case for just-in-time and super concentrated supply chains may weaken, as global firms weigh reliability against efficiency, leading to a need for more diversification and multilateralism. With the rising distrust of China, India could emerge as a strong alternative. We have to be prepared to capitalise with appropriate administrative, judicial and regulatory realignment. So what should investors do in the absence of any targeted relief package for them from the government? Bagga opines, \"Conserve your capital, stick to your asset allocation, build your emergency reserve and diversify. Staying optimistic and understanding market cycles is crucial to weather the downturns. \" Munot says, \"Several valuation measures such as market cap to GDP and long-term earnings-based yield spreads, are in the vicinity of Global Financial Crisis (GFC) lows of 2008. It suggests attractive entry points for long-term investors.

It is important to remember that your portfolio should be designed according to your needs and goals. Just like all eggs are not put into one basket, in the same way having a great portfolio means allocating different assets in the right proportion. Asset allocation is the key to building a successful portfolio that will navigate troubled times with ease, while clocking returns in the best of times. The Power of One with Many One of the most important steps to build a successful portfolio is properly dividing assets among different types of investments. Because these investments perform differently depending on economic conditions, a good balance can keep a portfolio strong in a wide range of economic situations. Proper asset allocation allows the optimal exposure to different assets individually, while having a combined effect reduces risk and protects returns better. What you put in the basket, how much, and when are the important factors. Goals, Risk Tolerance, and Time Horizon Asset allocation cannot be in a silo. Merely putting % numbers beside each asset class and adding them to make 100 is a futile way of attaining the ultimate goal: an all-weather proof investment solution. Many also make the mistake of using the '100 minus age' rule to decide equity allocation in an asset allocation framework. This is also a sub-optimal route. When putting together an asset allocation plan, it is most important to consider the interlinked factors of financial goals, risk tolerance and time horizons. A holistic view allows you to plan how much money you will need at certain points in your life and how much uncertainty you can tolerate in moving from one life stage to the next. What Works & What Doesn't Many investors think picking the best potential asset and allocating maximum money to it would be better. Others consider market timing to be the kingmaker. Research has shown otherwise. In reality, asset allocation plays 91.50% role and other factors together play only 8.5% role in the investment journey. In 2018, most of the equities had a tough time, especially midcap and smallcaps. In 2019, debt markets saw various upheavals. 2020 so Asset Allocation For A Smooth Investment Voyage far has seen all financial assets face the brunt of the pandemic triggered economic slowdown. What may seem the best potential asset class today may prove to be otherwise tomorrow. Market timing is next to impossible because no bells ring when peaks and troughs are hit in the real world. The best way to counter the uncertainties, be it a global financial crisis, a healthcare scare like Covid-19 or a local crunch like an Earthquake or Tsunami, is to be prepared with a well- diversified asset mix. Determine Your Blueprint Once you have decided your time horizon and the level of risk you're comfortable with, the next step is to determine the investment options that are most suited for your profile. Higher risk opens the door to greater rewards but one should be mindful of the risks. Your goals are sacrosanct and so is reaching them on time. Your retirement cannot wait beyond 65 years, your child's higher education or marriage cannot be postponed if markets turn turtle tomorrow. This is why the basket of assets should be built in such a way that there is no compromise in terms of meeting your goals at the required time. Equity offers the best long-term growth prospects to investors. Historically equity has outperformed other investments but they are also unpredictable. Fixed Kaushik Deva Founder & CEO, Kredere Wealth Partner Pvt Ltdincome investments are a safer investment but with relatively lower returns. Cash has a role to play when all assets are performing poorly. Combining different assets complements the strengths, while fixing the weaknesses of a portfolio. Asset Allocation through Mutual Funds Asset allocation funds offer different allocation of stocks, bonds and other investments to suit different investing profiles. While static asset allocation funds maintain the ratios of various asset classes, this approach is akin to using out-dated devices in a fast-changing world. Dynamism is the need of the hour. This is why dynamic asset allocation funds, which follow a model based approach consisting of various economic indicators, are best-suited. The model guides the asset allocation pattern of these funds. A change in economic conditions guides the allocation of investments to various asset classes. When the going is good, the fund adjusts. When there are problems, the fund realigns itself to the new reality. It's a hands-free solution that works automatically. Dynamic asset allocation funds have proved to be a relatively better investment option in various market cycles. They help eliminate two major human psychologies of greed & fear; this is done by working on the principal of buying low & selling high. By constantly rebalancing to reflect the intended allocation among the asset classes, shift of allocation between asset classes can ensure a smoother investment journey.

The author is MD, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management CompanyThe corona crisis has hit us all hard. Nobody could predict the scale of this crisis. This failure to foresee was due to mixed signals from global health agencies early on. As of now, there are three models to contain this problem. The Chinese model is of strict lockdown. The South Korean model is about large scale testing and isolation. The Japanese model is about strict personal and social hygiene. Combination of these three models may help us contain our corona problem. Going forward, we estimate that there may be a partial lockdown and partial mobility to tackle this issue. Market reaction has been steep. Our Market Capitalisation (M-Cap)-to-GDP ratio has come down to almost 50 per cent. This is almost close to the 2008 bottom (43 per cent of M-Cap-GDP) level. Price-to- book ratio is now trading at around 2x (forward basis). This is well below the historical average of 2.6x. Today, almost 43 per cent of top 1,000 stocks are trading below 1x book value. Some of the bluest of blue-chips falls in this set. Today, Nifty 50 is back at levels seen last in 2016. Similarly, Nifty Midcap 100 is down to 2014 levels. The Nifty Smallcap 100 is at around 2011 levels. The issue is related to health and needs a medical solution. Market recovery may have to wait for this. There are some positive side-effects emerging from the current crisis as well. For one, the Brent crude oil prices have fallen to $25 per barrel. Every dollar drop in oil prices gives us an advantage of $1.5 billion. As per estimates, we are looking at a gain of $40 to $45 billion to the economy due to falling crude oil prices. Moreover, there has been a massive stimulus provided by the RBI and the other global banks. This liquidity, sooner or later, is likely to cause asset price-rise again. Most importantly, the global supply chain may get re-balanced post the crisis. MNCs may look to diversify their suppliers away from China to avoid supply shocks going ahead. As a result, we may see significant industrial investments come to India in search of opportunities.

The equity markets have seen an unprecedented selloff across the board in the last eight to 10 weeks. This selloff has been occasioned by the rapid spread of the pandemic in several countries and therefore, some disruption was expected to happen in the major global economies. Such disruptions affect economic growth, output, aggregate demand and supply, employment and a host of other key macro economic variables. The adverse impact on these variables results in lower income for households, unemployment, and also lower earnings for companies. It is this chain of factors that caused the selloff thereby magnifying the probability of a global economic slowdown.We have also seen overseas investors exiting the domestic market. From the lows we had seen on the indices, a fall of 30 to 40 per cent, the markets have moved up by about 20 per cent in the last few trading sessions. But it is still too early to say that the markets have bottomed out, as much would depend on the extent of its further spread, containment of its spread, the fiscal and monetary measures, which the central banks and the governments are likely to initiate.

Combination of these three models may help us contain our corona problem. Going forward, we estimate that there may be a partial lockdown and partial mobility to tackle this issue. Market reaction has been steep. Our Market Capitalisation (M-Cap)-to-GDP ratio has come down to almost 50 per cent. This is almost close to the 2008 bottom (43 per cent of M-Cap-GDP) level. Price-to- book ratio is now trading at around 2x (forward basis). This is well below the historical average of 2.6x. Today, almost 43 per cent of top 1,000 stocks are trading below 1x book value. Some of the bluest of blue-chips falls in this set. Today, Nifty 50 is back at levels seen last in 2016. Similarly, Nifty Midcap 100 is down to 2014 levels. The Nifty Smallcap 100 is at around 2011 levels. The issue is related to health and needs a medical solution. Market recovery may have to wait for this. There are some positive side-effects emerging from the current crisis as well. For one, the Brent crude oil prices have fallen to $25 per barrel. Every dollar drop in oil prices gives us an advantage of $1.5 billion. As per estimates, we are looking at a gain of $40 to $45 billion to the economy due to falling crude oil prices. Moreover, there has been a massive stimulus provided by the RBI and the other global banks. This liquidity, sooner or later, is likely to cause asset price-rise again. Most importantly, the global supply chain may get re-balanced post the crisis. MNCs may look to diversify their suppliers away from China to avoid supply shocks going ahead. As a result, we may see significant industrial investments come to India in search of opportunities. If India helps settle companies moving out of China like Tata-Motors was settled in Sanand (near Ahemdabad, Gujarat) with one SMS of 'Suswagatam' (welcome); then NIlesh s hAhCover Story Long-term investors can invest in credit / dynamic bond funds We are currently going through COVID-19 pandemic and this crisis has given birth to a bye-product called lockdown, resulting in tremendous amount of anxiety and uncertainty in financial markets across the globe. The equity markets have seen an unprecedented selloff across the board in the last eight to 10 weeks. This selloff has been occasioned by the rapid spread of the pandemic in several countries and therefore, some disruption was expected to happen in the major global economies. Such disruptions affect economic growth, output, aggregate demand and supply, employment and a host of other key macro economic variables. The adverse impact on these variables results in lower income for households, unemployment, and also lower earnings for companies. It is this chain of factors that caused the selloff thereby magnifying the probability of a global economic slowdown.We have also seen overseas investors exiting the domestic market. From the lows we had seen on the indices, a fall of 30 to 40 per cent, the markets have moved up by about 20 per cent in the last few trading sessions. But it is still too early to say that the markets have bottomed out, as much would depend on the extent of its further spread, containment of its spread, the fiscal and monetary measures, which the central banks and the governments are likely to initiate. As of now all the major central banks including the Fed, RBI, Bank of Japan, have all enacted measures to prop up the money supply, the liquidity and credit. In this backdrop, one would like to know how far the recovery is. Bhavesh Sanghvi, CEO, Emkay Wealth Management says, \"We need to see their final impact, which may take time as is the case with monetary policy actions. But the comforting factor is that the government and the RBI have taken many unconventional measures to combat this unusual foe. The actual numbers on GDP , employment, CPI and IIP , which we will see in the 24 Outlook Money May 2020 www.outlookmoney.comTake Good Advantage Of This Crisis Experts feel it is a God-sent opportunity for long-term and first time investors By Yagnesh Kansara26 Outlook Money May 2020 www.outlookmoney.com www.outlookmoney.com May 2020 Outlook Money 27Cover Story coming months would tell us the depth of the economic and financial impact of the pandemic. \" At the moment the market looks positive. The world response to the crisis is happening while the crisis is still on, unlike any previous crisis. During subprime crisis of 2008, US response with quantitative easing (QE) was months after the crisis surfaced. Subprime crisis was developing and the US Government and US Fed could have anticipated the same in time, yet the government response was late. COVID-19 crisis didn't give enough preparation time to any country and yet the response is quick. More than $7-8 trillion have been committed to revive global economies. This is not financial or sectoral or country specific crisis but a health crisis, which has gripped all major economies and continents. We need to understand the impact of this crisis on Indian markets.Bhavesh D Damania, Founder and Chief Care Taker, Wealthcare Investments, says, \"This is unprecedented and therefore I do not think it is easy to answer the question. I think flattening of COVID-19 curve across western world will decide the course of the market. If we have to believe China, it took them 100 days to bring back total normalcy in Wuhan so that much time will be needed for western world to return to normalcy. For India, if lockdown continues through May 2020 then we are going to have a very tough time in putting economy back on track. Our GDP growth will be around 1 per cent, we will see huge stress in SME, MSME and Infrastructure sector which will aggravate the labour market pains. Employment across the spectrum of skill sets will be impacted due to slower economic activities and consumption. It appears that western world's curve is flattening but ours might steepen further. So while others will be out of woods, India may still be fighting the battle for few more months beyond May\" . The damage this pandemic has done is devastating. While any death is unfortunate, India has been successful in restricting fatality numbers after five weeks into the lockdown. One key monitorable is any relapse of the virus, as seen in recent reports overseas. Amar Ambani, Senior President and Head of Research - Institutional Equities, YES Securities, feels, \"Whether equity market has bottomed or not, will depend on when we're able to rein control over the COVID-19 virus. Once the number of daily new cases begins to stagnate is when the market will breathe a sigh of relief. Having said that, I think most of the damage in price has already been done. But we may still see time wise consolidation in 2020. Volatility, for the rest of this year, will remain elevated, as fall in GDP gets reported and certain sectors see a follow-on damage. Bank NPAs will rise and global stress will set in. \" The current crisis differs from previous ones in more than one way. Several falls have happened during tech burst phase, Harshad Mehta scam case and in 2008. This is because, in previous crisis, it was only one or other sector that was impacted. However, this time, almost all the sectors have been majorly impacted due to lockdown. With most of the world is shut, there is hardly any life and business that has remained unaffected. During that time it was more of a financial market meltdown but this time it is more like an economic meltdown. Himanshu Kohli, Co- Founder, Client Associates says whatever damage that was to happen is reflecting in the prices. He adds, \"In my opinion, 65-75 per cent or two- third to three-fourth of the fall has already happened and one-third or one-fourth more would happen. Right now it is hard to predict whether we stand at 25,000 levels or 22,000 levels of the Sensex, but the majority of the fall has already happened\" . Does it mean we have entered the bear market phase? A bull market or a bear market is a normal market formation and it is part and parcel of the cyclicality that we see in economic phenomena. In other words, the economic phenomena happen in cycles. But in such situations, a fall in the economy and markets happen over a period of time, that is, periodicity is a feature of cycle. The last time we had bearish market was the time the great recession was developing and maturing around 2006-2008. However, current phase of the market is bear market or not, the opinions are divided. Sanghvi says, \"The current situation is quite interesting - the economic difficulties are caused by the pandemic, or rather the fear of the consequences of pandemic. Therefore, we cannot call this technically a bear market, but it can be termed a market characterised by extreme negative sentiment resulting in a selloff. Therefore, the recovery may be faster than a bear market downswing\" . By definition, bear markets are defined as 20 per cent fall in prices, declining economic prospects and negative investor sentiments. Of these three factors, only investor sentiment is positive. The EU and the US have entered the recession but determination to fight the crisis and restore growth plus confidence is quite evident today so we may not see markets falling substantially hereon. Damania says, \"India has unique issue of poverty, population, unemployment, fiscal constraint and medical infrastructure so our response within limited tools will decide the course of recovery at homeland. It is safe to believe that our market will find direction in the next two to three months and volatility will be maximum in this period. Needless to mention that economic recovery will happen next year only. History suggests that after every global health crisis, the recovery has been V-shaped rather than U or L-shaped. \" Ambani firmly believes that we are passing through a bear market phase. He argues, \"The current state of market certainly qualifies as a bear phase with the extent of price damage seen. In the past, such periods have lasted for one to three years before the previous market peak is reached again. But this time around, the time period may be shorter. This is because - one, it is a health crisis and not a financial crisis so we can bounce-back fast, once full economic activity resumes and two, there isn't much froth in the market since this fall was not preceded by a massive 4-6x rally in the benchmark indices\" . The current volatility in the market and its current state is because of risk averse approach adopted by the Foreign Portfolio Investors, (FPIs), adds Kohli.

But this is not permanent. As soon as there is positive news or sign of a cure being discovered for corona or vaccination or medicine is out, the markets will jump up and revive. In the past we have seen some bear phases but we have been able to recover\" . Recovery from the current level means there is only one way and that is up. Does that mean the market has entered a stage from where the downside is limited and it is offering a lucrative buying opportunity? The downside for the markets is anyone's guess from here after such a drastic fall in such a short time. Two quick parameters one can use to gauge how expensive the market is - are the price-earnings ratio and the price-to-book ratio. The trailing P/E for the domestic indexes for the last ten years shows that the markets are at reasonable valuations based on longer term trends. A very significant longer-term measure is the price- to-book ratio. The lowest P/B in the last 20 years was 2.12 in April 2003, and thereafter, it moved up to 6.23 in December 2007. At present the Nifty P/B is at 2.40. This shows that, from a long-term investment perspective, the intrinsic value of the assets is much higher than the price at which they are offered. Sanghvi recommends equity is definitely a good buy. \"But it should be executed in a phased manner over the next six to nine months to ensure we participate in any dip that may be seen hereafter, \" he suggests. In direct equity investment one should be into quality stocks with attractive cash position and cash flows, and also leadership position indicated by market share, he adds. On valuation side, India is trading at Market cap to GDP ratio of 49 per cent which quite low. Another point to note is that Indian equities haven't delivered even FD equivalent returns since last 5 and 10 years on point-to-point basis. Damania firmly says, \"So it looks like we don't have much to lose from here. There are street estimates of Nifty 50 going down to around 6800 - 7000 levels also. I believe if the market goes to those levels, there will be fresh buying and bulls will take charge. So market will rebound very quickly as we saw in early April. \" For investors with a longer term horizon (three to five years), this is the God sent opportunity. Investors who do not check the stock prices on day to day basis and follow the principle of 'Invest it, forget it' , the time has come. Ambani says, \"Long-term investors wouldn't get such price levels if all was hunky dory in the economy. Another advantage is that the market will give you time to identify the best trades and buy at your price. One needs to revisit their asset allocation based on risk profile and allocate accordingly. \" The equity market in the second week of April stands at a discount of about 10-15 per cent to its historical average price. Kohli maintains this is a good time to accumulate and not buying in one shot but in stages. Depending on your profile and depending on whether you're an aggressive or conservative investor, you can invest anywhere for 3 to 12 months. It is advisable to invest in stages irrespective of whether you are investing in weekly SIPs or monthly SIPs only to the extent of the gap between the desired equity allocations in the portfolio, he adds. This is a God-sent opportunity not only for long-term investors but for the first time investors too. After doing enough brainstorming with respect to risk profile and future financial goals, they should clearly follow what investment guru Charlie Munger says. Sanghvi quotes Munger, who says, \"You need patience, discipline and an agility to take losses and adversity without going crazy. The big money is not in the buying and selling, but in the waiting. \" But the first time investors need to be careful before deploying all their funds into the market, cautions hIMANshu KohlI Co-Founder, Client Associates The current volatility is because of risk averse approach adopted by Foreign Portfolio InvestorsBhAV esh sAN ghVI CEO, Emkay Wealth Management The numbers on GDP, employment, CPI and IIP in coming months would tell about the impact Ambani. He says, \"First thing they should do is to ensure that there is enough emergency liquidity for 9-12 months. Any excess liquidity beyond that should be used to buy diversified mutual funds and certain direct stocks. If there isn't enough emergency money to set aside, it's also a great time to start an SIP\" . These SIPs can be on a weekly basis or a monthly basis and with a minimum 5 to 10 years-time horizon, shares Kohli. After agreeing that this is the most opportune time to invest in equity with a quite longer term horizon, experts also agree on certain sectors in which investing will be beneficial in the immediate future. Sectors like pharma and healthcare, telecom and consumer staples may have some benefits emanating from current conditions. The technology sector may gain to some extent due to the weaker Rupee as they would get a better rate on their foreign currency receivables and they also the benefit of many long- term contracts with fixed rates. But for the longer term, the sector that may do better compared to other sectors as well will be the consumption and BFSI as they are the backbone of a booming economy. Telecom appears to be one sector that is gaining on account of social distancing. People are consuming more content on their phones. This crisis is going to alter behaviour in a big way. People will also feel compelled to have adequate health insurance cover in future. The other sector that will get benefit is the insurance sector because a lot of people would like to now buy cover for them, whether it is life, health or general insurance. The sectors one should avoid for the time being till the full recovery takes place includes luxury and aspirational products as they will take time to revive as the mass push will be missing for a little longer time. Aviation, travel, leisure, entertainment, real estate sectors will be worst hit and should be avoided till normalcy gets restored. As President Obama's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, during the global financial crisis of 2008 said, \"Never let a good crisis go waste\" .

The adverse effect, it is having on major global bourses and other investment instruments, are also massive. Among the investors, those who have maximum exposure to the stock markets, were most hit due to the bloodbath that took place in the bourses. Even the Indian government has drastically chopped the interest rates for small savings schemes for the returns. Thus the average earnings of a person from various investments have already become much lower. The COVID-19 outbreak, affecting thousands, has sent shockwaves throughout the country. Raghuram Rajan, former governor of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in his recent blog titled \"Perhaps India's Greatest Challenge in Recent Times\" says economically, India is probably facing its greatest emergency since independence. Rajan had also predicted the 2008 global economic recession. The equity market players have lost crores of rupees in this pandemic. The prolonged lockdown across the country, to keep the pandemic at bay, has cost heavily. \"Most of the investors who were invested in equity lost 30 to 40 per cent of their equity portfolio. These are notional losses though and will become real losses only if they are booked,\" says Renu Maheshwari, Co-founder and Principal Adviser, Finscholarz Wealth Managers. Rajesh Cheruvu, CIO, Validus Wealth further explains the loss incurred by saying that depending on the asset class they were invested, large caps lost around -23 per cent for the month of March; mid- caps around -30 per cent; global emerging markets around -15 per cent. \"Debt investors were slightly better off, looking at the positive 10Y G-Sec return. Gold (in rupees) also managed to eke out a single digit positive return for the month. Commodities no doubt did not perform in the larger scheme of things given the demand collapse and geo-political tensions between the US and OPEC+. So, net-net in the grander time horizon year-to-date so far, cash has probably been the king.\" In any market crash equity investors are the worst hit. This crash is no exception either. Most of the equity portfolios across industry have lost almost equally. Some sell off happened in debt as well but most of them recovered quickly. Debt funds have also seen volatility. Bank deposits have not taken any hit as they are not traded in the market. Now with a lot of money washed away by the pandemic tsunami how to rebuild portfolios to square off the losses in future? \"For those who have lost a lot of money in stocks and mutual funds during this period, they can, of course, gain it back as long as they have not done stock-picking individually. This is one of the reasons first quarter of 2020-21, which means popular small savings schemes like Public Provident Fund (PPF), National Savings Certificate (NSC) and Kisan Vikas Patra (KVP) will yield lesser return now.

The adverse effect, it is having on major global bourses and other investment instruments, are also massive. Among the investors, those who have maximum exposure to the stock markets, were most hit due to the bloodbath that took place in the bourses. Even the Indian government has drastically chopped the interest rates for small savings schemes for the returns. Thus the average earnings of a person from various investments have already become much lower. The COVID-19 outbreak, affecting thousands, has sent shockwaves throughout the country. Raghuram Rajan, former governor of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in his recent blog titled \"Perhaps India's Greatest Challenge in Recent Times\" says economically, India is probably facing its greatest emergency since independence. Rajan had also predicted the 2008 global economic recession. The equity market players have lost crores of rupees in this pandemic. The prolonged lockdown across the country, to keep the pandemic at bay, has cost heavily. \"Most of the investors who were invested in equity lost 30 to 40 per cent of their equity portfolio. These are notional losses though and will become real losses only if they are booked,\" says Renu Maheshwari, Co-founder and Principal Adviser, Finscholarz Wealth Managers. Rajesh Cheruvu, CIO, Validus Wealth further explains the loss incurred by saying that depending on the asset class they were invested, large caps lost around -23 per cent for the month of March; mid- caps around -30 per cent; global emerging markets around -15 per cent. \"Debt investors were slightly better off, looking at the positive 10Y G-Sec return. Gold (in rupees) also managed to eke out a single digit positive return for the month. Commodities no doubt did not perform in the larger scheme of things given the demand collapse and geo-political tensions between the US and OPEC+. So, net-net in the grander time horizon year-to-date so far, cash has probably been the king.\" In any market crash equity investors are the worst hit. This crash is no exception either. Most of the equity portfolios across industry have lost almost equally. Some sell off happened in debt as well but most of them recovered quickly. Debt funds have also seen volatility. Bank deposits have not taken any hit as they are not traded in the market. Now with a lot of money washed away by the pandemic tsunami how to rebuild portfolios to square off the losses in future? \"For those who have lost a lot of money in stocks and mutual funds during this period, they can, of course, gain it back as long as they have not done stock-picking individually. This is one of the reasons first quarter of 2020-21, which means popular small savings schemes like Public Provident Fund (PPF), National Savings Certificate (NSC) and Kisan Vikas Patra (KVP) will yield lesser return now.

If you have additional money that you do not need for next five years, invest gradually into equity. This can average your cost of investment and help you gain faster when the markets start recovering,\" she says. Harsh Jain, Co-founder, and COO, Groww says: \"The first thing that we would want to tell all the investors who have their funds stuck in the markets is - do not fall prey to panic selling. In fact, even the investors who have booked losses will agree that by selling in a panic, they booked losses that were only notional before. On the other hand, if they would have held on with a longer-term view, then they could have reduced the losses or even earned returns. Hence, for people still invested in the market, our first advice is to not sell anything unless they analyse their investment portfolio carefully. They need to assess the strength of each underlying security to determine if it can survive such volatility or not. Once this is clear, the investors can create a list of investments that they want to redeem and wait for the right opportunity to cash out.\" Even after it is gone, COVID-19 pandemic will leave an impression in the minds of the people and it will take a while before they again start investing freely. This pandemic will probably change the world forever. Post and pre COVID-19 world can be very different and the biggest difference will come in terms of psychology.Rahul Agarwal, Director, Wealth Discovery and EZ Wealth advices to reassess risk taking capacity and re- balance portfolio accordingly. \"Shift from low quality stocks to fundamental strong companies that have a chances of quick recovery once the market is back to stable conditions. This would be the right time to invest fresh capital or average down on the existing stock holdings. The equity markets have corrected over 30 per cent from their peaks and although there may be further downside, the risk of another significant correction has whittled down. The best strategy in this period would be to look for stocks that have been hit especially hard but have stronger pedigree to withstand the crisis. Some sectors to look into at this point would be auto, cement, steel, real-estate hospitality and aviation sector,\" he adds. Throwing some light on how to recover the lost valuations, Shankar says: \"For equity investors, we suggest incremental allocation to multi-cap funds, managed by experts, who have demonstrated their skill sets across various market cycles and who have demonstrated capabilities of shifting the underlying portfolio across market capitalisation, depending on prevailing market scenario. For fixed income investors, we suggest focusing on accrual oriented, high quality portfolios (predominantly AAA), through a combination of banking and PSU debt funds, corporate bond funds, and passive roll down strategies.\" He says in order to remain insulated from the present volatility, the investor has to follow a disciplined investment process and have the temperament to hold on for the long term despite interim volatility. Ongoing periodic reviews and rebalancing (as and when required) are critical to ensure that the portfolio does not deviate from the stated goals as per the investment charter. Everyone is looking for a formula to tide over this tumultuous time. People are cautiously holding on to their jobs and hoping everything will become all right. No one knows what the future holds for mankind, but surely to survive money is needed and since it does not grow on trees, one has to multiply it intelligently to remain insulated from upheavals. aparajita@outlookindia.com, vishav@outlookindia.com NSC PPFRDCover Story rAhul Ag ArWAl Director, Wealth Discovery and EZ Wealth Look for stocks that have been hit hard but have stronger pedigree to withstand crisis AD 2The fear of a global economic slowdown owing to Covid-19 related shutdowns led to equity markets across the world steeply correcting. Since the start of the outbreak in China, investors globally have lost colossal amount of wealth. In Indian equity market investors alone lost `40 lakh crore between February and March 2020. Owing to this many investors seeing their portfolio in red, decided to cash out of the market. This action resulted in turning notional losses into permanent loss. Greed & Fear Cycle When the market rallies, irrespective of market valuations, investors tend to rush to the market. This is largely due to the fear of missing out on the market rally. Conversely, when the market corrects investors tend to rush out of the market in an attempt to protect their investments. Novice investors tend to redeem their SIP investments or stop their SIP altogether fearing further losses. Both of these extremes are never helpful from an investor's perspective. SIPs the way to go In order to make the most of equity markets, it is advised that one should stay invested over the long term. The implicit understanding here is that as market moves through a cycle of bull, bear and sideways movement, one's investment across these Use SIP and STPs to gain from market volatility phases will help accumulate units (in case of mutual fund) thereby helping lower the cost of acquisition. The best approach to make the most of opportunities present across the market phases is to invest through SIPs. SIP offers investors a low ticket gateway to equity market. Benefits Galore There are a host of other benefits as well when one invests through SIP . First it's the power of compounding. Second, rupee cost averaging. If you are investing in mutual funds via SIP it is important to understand this term. The price of SIP units is calculated as Net Asset Value (NAV). By investing for long, one gets the opportunity to average out the cost of each mutual fund unit. For example: Suppose, in a month, an investment of `1,500 led to an allotment of 100 units, meaning that the NAV was at `15 per unit. Now if the market corrects and the NAV comes down Bharat Bagla Chief Dreamer at Bees Network Ltdto `10, then that month an investment of `1,500 will lead to an allocation of 150 units. This effectively means that when one stays invested across the cycle, one gets the opportunity to accumulate more units at the same cost. Third, low ticket size. The best part with SIP based investment is that you can start investments with as low as `500 or `1,000 per month. However, this varies from scheme to scheme. So, before starting with investments, check on the minimum investment amount. If one decided to stay invested over a decade, notwithstanding short term volatility, the chances to a negative investment experience is very unlikely. Use STP STP stands for Systematic Transfer Plan. This is a very useful tool in portfolio management. Many a times as a financial goal nears, it is important to safeguard the returns generated. So, one can start transferring a part of corpus from an equity fund into a debt fund such that the corpus generated stay protected from sudden equity market volatility. At such time use the STP option to transfer your fund and seamlessly manage your investments. The mutual fund industry today provides several tools aimed at easing an investor's needs. Be sure to know about these tools and use them as well. To conclude, it is difficult to go wrong with a long term SIP in a good fund. The only thing we have to ensure is to stay invested.

One thing remains obvious is that economic output is expected to slump sharply in the coming days. According to International Monetary Fund (IMF), the pandemic will shrink the world output by 3 per cent in 2020. It has been a turbulent time for the equity and the mutual fund markets in India as the Indian markets (NSE Nifty 50) has seen a meltdown of over 30 per cent from their peak and is currently down by 24 per cent on a Year-To-Date (YTD) basis as on April 20, 2020. Similarly, Assets Under Management (AUMs) of the mutual fund industry saw a dip of 18.2 per cent sequentially to reach ` 22.3 lakh crore in March 2020, reveals data from Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). If compared to March 2019, the industry has fallen by 6.4 per cent translating to an asset base reduction of ` 1.53 lakh crore in FY2020. The equity AUMs have suffered due to the massive sell-off in the broad market, despite net inflows in open ended equity-oriented schemes reached ` 11,723 crore in March 2020. In the wake of this crisis many economists and market experts have expressed the types of post- pandemic recoveries one can witness. This would either be a \"V-shaped\" recovery, where there is a strong and rapid recovery of the economy post slump in GDP or a \"U-shaped\" recovery where the GDP downturn is long- lasting and takes longer than 12 months to recover. However, in the end it is futile to time the market, or call the bottom. No one can predict the shape of the recovery - U, V, W, or some other, as the pandemic of this nature is often hard to model.

However, funds like Dynamic Asset Allocation Funds (DAAF), despite low risk, may not outperform like pure equity funds. \"The only thing that doesn't work with DAAF is that in case markets go up by 30 per cent, a regular equity fund will go up by 30 per cent, but DAAF might only go up by 27 per cent.

And this crisis has not only affected those who are infected by the virus, but the entire population, whether directly or indirectly. Among the biggest victims, after those who were actually infected, are perhaps the small investors who had put in their hard-earned savings in the equity market through mutual funds route or otherwise. WIth stock markets correcting by over 30 per cent due to the pandemic, before recovering a little bit, their portfolios have lost huge portion of wealth and there seems to be no signs visible of recovering those losses in the near-term with the whole global economy coming to a standstill and possibility of a global recession becoming more and more real. And it's not just the stock markets that have been hit. Conservative investors would also have to settle for less returns going forward as the returns on Fixed Deposits (FD), Recurring Deposits (RD) and other fixed income assets have already gone down and it is expected that interest rates are going to be lower in the times ahead. In such a scenario, many investors face the question of what they should do with their savings now: should they hold on to cash or should they invest, and where should they invest. According to Joseph Thomas, Head of Research, Emkay Wealth Management, while equities are \"clearly at buy levels\" because the price to book value of the Nifty 50 is at an all-time low of close to 2.50, fixed income products and fixed return products should also be a part of the portfolio as they offer stability to the portfolio and provides the much-needed balancing factor especially in times of high volatility. \"In terms of investing in this climate, two important factors should be borne in mind, which are of fundamental importance to the act of investing.

It is equally important to assess whether you are getting advice from a team of reliable and experienced professionals who always work with you, irrespective of whether markets are falling or booming,\" he says. In terms of fixed returns assets, Thomas advises that one needs to be careful as adverse movements in interest rates may jeopardise the portfolio objectives. \"At this juncture, it makes immense sense to stay at the short end of the curve, that is short term products, like short term bond funds, banking and PSU Debt funds. These products have a maturity profile of two years to three or four years and the price impact of a rise in rates would be quite limited. The benefit of higher liquidity usually accrues to the short end of the curve and therefore, that is the preferred region. With trajectory of growth and inflation highly uncertain, and the likely expansion in fiscal deficit, it is a better idea to avoid long bonds,\" he adds. However, for those investors who have some appetite for risk and have patience to wait for at least three years, this is perhaps the right time to make some significant wealth by investing in equity markets, according to Rahul Agarwal, Director, Wealth Discovery and EZ Wealth. \"If you have a low risk appetite for equity, but want to invest for long term, then go for the best secured option such as small savings schemes which have a higher rate of interest. For example, you can put your money in PPF which gives 7.1 per cent (for April - June quarter) and also avail tax benefits on investments, withdrawals and interest earned. If you have already exhausted the available limit of 1.5 lakhs and have surplus funds to invest, then opt for opening PPF accounts in the name of your family members including minor children and park the money there for long-term savings,\" he advises. Archit Gupta, Founder, and CEO, ClearTax, holds a contrary view as he feels that bank deposits are not going to be a great option at this point as the interest rates would fall with the market. \"The central bank will lower the interest rates in order to boost economic growth and GDP when the economic condition is not conducive. Therefore, the returns that the bank FDs would offer would not be attractive. Markets being down makes a good time for investors to go for equity-linked investments. If one lacks market knowledge, then they can opt to invest in equity mutual funds,\" Gupta says. Gold is another asset class, which may be looked at for its enduring value due to its store of value function. However, like other asset classes, gold, too, has been impacted by this global health crisis which is fast turning into a much bigger economic one. Gold price naturally reflects an upward bias but it has not just been one way but volatile, says Somasundaram PR, Managing Director-India, World Gold Council. In an era of leveraged positions and rule- based trading, gold too has witnessed massive liquidations, perhaps to raise cash to cover losses in other asset classes. \"While another bout of quantitative easing and low/negative real interest rates will be hugely positive for gold, consumer markets for gold jewellery could see a deep phase of uncertainty as income contraction amid volatile gold prices and supply ArchIt g uPtA Founder, and CEO ClearTax Markets being down makes a good time for investors to go for equity-linked investments disruptions could affect buyers' sentiment. As weddings and other occasions could turn out to be low key affairs for at least a year after this crisis is over, gold demand could slump,\" he says. In terms of real estate as an asset class, even this segment has faced several ups and downs over the past few years. While some green shoots were emerging for the real estate industry, the sector has once again confronted a challenge in the form of the pandemic which may have a considerable impact. However, according to Sunil Mishra, CEO, Trespect, given the volatile nature of most other asset classes, real estate is proving to be a safe bet for most buyers, provided they remain invested for a long-term. \"Real estate has traditionally been a favourite for many investors even before most modern stock markets had started trading. This preference is based on three underlying benefits - regular income in the form of rent, security and safety, and healthy appreciation in value. One of the biggest arguments in support of real estate has been its tangible nature. Your real estate investment can be seen and experienced. It is a physical asset that can be used for residence or leased out to generate income. And unlike other asset classes like stocks, no crisis can wipe out your real estate investment entirely,\" he clarifies.Mishra adds that while real estate returns may not have touched dizzying heights like stocks and gold but neither have they hit rock bottom. However, due to the lockdown, the sector has also been hit with construction being halted due to the lockdown. \"In the next few months there may be a dip in the pace of the sector with reduced new launches and extension in completion of projects. However, housing remains a basic necessity and demand will continue to exist once the situation normalises,\" says Surendra Hiranandani, Chairman and Managing Director, House of Hiranandani.

While these are tough times, this is also a good time to analyse and rebalance one's investment portfolio. EZ Wealth's Agarwal feels it is advisable to get rid of speculative investments and add diversification to one's portfolio. Some amount of gold needs to be added to investment portfolios as a hedge against uncertainty. If one is too underweight on equity, perhaps it is the right time to have some exposure to equity.

In fact, some are calling it a bigger crisis, since more people across the world are affected. With strict lockdown measures across the globe and India, this crisis is going to impact businesses in a way that has never been seen before. Now the situation is more serious than 2008 - the devastation is faster and unknown. Naturally jobs will be affected. \"The formal sector contributes to more than 60 per cent plus to the country's GDP. Companies are mature and bracing to absorb the hit by taking salary cuts so as to minimise job losses. However, 10 to 20 per cent loss of jobs and a gross impact of around 7 to 10 per cent on salaries are expected. It will also be important to wait and see for how long the demand and consumption is impacted due to COVID-19,\" says Kunal Gupta, Founder & CEO, Mount Talent Consulting. However, things hold promise in the medium to long term. \"Exports are impacted, however, India Inc could gain a larger global market share due to low costs and high level of quality, anti-China sentiment and a democratic system in India. We could see a surge in manufacturing, technology growth and exports in a couple of years,\" he adds. COVID-19 has already caused a lot of human suffering and economic disruption. As per the recently released OECD Economic Outlook Interim Report (March 2020), global growth could drop to 1.5 per cent in 2020, half the rate projected prior to the virus. \"The rapid spread is negating all global and Indian economic revival efforts.

However, the impact is going to vary across sectors with some sectors being affected in a major way, while others are weathering out the storm better because their business will not be impacted as much.

The pandemic will have an impact on the employment in the informal sector that are dependent on daily earnings with most of the work being outbound and cannot be done from home. For formal sectors, we have to wait to see how the lockdown relaxation pans out. With businesses being impacted so severely, salary cuts and job losses may become a reality. The disruption to the global economy due to the pandemic is expected to wipe out 6.7 per cent of working hours globally in the second quarter of 2020 - an equivalent of 195 million jobs worldwide, as per International Labour Organisation's COVID-19 and the World of Work report.

Many companies across the spectrum are hiring. \"In fact, many companies who had issued offer letters for hiring on a mass level are honouring their commitments in spite of unfortunate event of layoffs.\" He adds that while top and middle management can expect to undergo salary cuts and deferred payments of anywhere from 10 per cent to 30 per cent on average, the duration should be expected to not be lesser than six months at least. Organisations that can meet a critical balance of their cost and revenue with the top management salary cuts, will afford to stay away from salary cuts at bottom levels. However when the push comes to shove, announcements on salary cuts across the board will not be surprising anymore. Says Chakraborty, \"Every company shall come up with different criterias to evaluate jobs and salaries\". Some might look at rationalising headcount by segregating employees as performers, potentials and laggards. Some might segregate based on criticality of job roles. Some might choose grade wise pay cuts (higher wagers taking higher cuts) to save more jobs overall. Some might choose to cut jobs and ensure wage protection of those they want to retain. If the disruption is prolonged it could have a bearing on India's imports from the countries which are critical for domestic economic activity. \"Sectors such as the tourism and hospitality industry in India could render 3.8 crore people jobless, which is a substantial part of the total workforce.

In fact, some are calling it a bigger crisis, since more people across the world are affected. With strict lockdown measures across the globe and India, this crisis is going to impact businesses in a way that has never been seen before. Now the situation is more serious than 2008 - the devastation is faster and unknown. Naturally jobs will be affected. \"The formal sector contributes to more than 60 per cent plus to the country's GDP. Companies are mature and bracing to absorb the hit by taking salary cuts so as to minimise job losses. However, 10 to 20 per cent loss of jobs and a gross impact of around 7 to 10 per cent on salaries are expected. It will also be important to wait and see for how long the demand and consumption is impacted due to COVID-19,\" says Kunal Gupta, Founder & CEO, Mount Talent Consulting.

However, with over 80,000 of the recently published job openings at entry level positions, it is encouraging to see that these are available at a point when the next batch of fresh graduates are entering the job market. \"It remains to be seen if the campus commitments are kept by the enterprises. While some have been seen honouring offers made, the reality can only be seen in a few months from now,\" says Karanth. He adds that sectors in this new normal economy will create more avenues for freshers across colleges whether top or medium ranked. Fields like fintech, hitech, research, agritech, healthtech, manufacturing,exports and a few others might see a good run to hire human capital at the base of the pyramid. It is too early to predict when things will get back to normal. However, even as some sectors bounce back faster, others will take a longer time. Singh believes that to prevent an economic contagion that parallels the virus' rampage, the government needs to quickly announce measures to protect jobs and ensure the private sector, especially the small and medium businesses can survive. There is a need to immediately get cash in the hands of the private sector to enable them to pay salaries and survive. \"We expect things to start bouncing back from the third to fourth quarter of this year. We also feel that the job market will grow at a different speed in some sectors during this new normal. Work from home and remote jobs might see a super boom in the new normal economy,\" says Rajappan. Optimistically one should look at 9 to 12 months for a normalcy of numbers getting restored. \"But there is above average probability that a part of the workforce may return getting engaged in something different from what they did pre-COVI\u201419,\" says Karanth.

There is a flood of negative news flowing from all corners of the globe. Under these circumstances, investors are left to brave market volatility while seeing their portfolio value (life savings) erode substantially. When stock markets turn volatile it brings along a certain sense of uncertainty and human beings in general are not adept when asked to deal with uncertainty. For an investor, the fear of loss is more unnerving than the actual loss or even the joy of a gain. Therefore, it is not the volatility but the uncertainty due to volatility that causes emotional setbacks. For example: When on a roller costar ride, the ups and down of the ride is a part of the enjoyment and is not to be feared. Similarly, market volatility is not be feared but is to be enjoyed by an equity investor. Volatility must be considered as a friend of an investor rather than an enemy. The important point to note here is that an investor's response (emotional action), stemming from the fear of loss triggered by market volatility, read stopping SIPs or redeeming investments, may actually result in a permanent loss. Therefore, it is imperative to understand that market volatility is not the problem but it our aggregate decision of what we do during volatile times which actually hurts an investor. Hence we investors are only responsible for the volatility seen in our portfolios. Market corrections over the past decades have largely varied between 20% - 30%. In extreme instance there has been 50% correction as well. Every other year a long term investor would have witnessed 10% swings too. But despite all these developments, equity markets have eventually recovered and have successfully made new highs. Only those who have stayed invested could have benefitted from such corrections and the ensuing rallies. However, what is often seen is that fearing notional losses, investors rush in to redeem their investments thereby making the losses permanent. By doing so, one becomes an unfortunate victim of the fear of market volatility. It is often said that in equity markets losses are temporary but gains are permanent. As an investor, it is important to understand that volatility which is seen from time-to-Long Live Volatility time is responsible for superior returns generated over long term. This is because volatile times provide an investor with the opportunity to buy/ accumulate more units (in case of mutual fund) at lower price, helping us to lower cost of acquisition. And in case of major market dislocation, like the one seen recently, then investors can consider lump sum investment as well. If the volatility were to reduce then the opportunity to make outsized gains also reduces. Therefore, an investor should not only learn to live with volatility but also learn to tide over volatility gainfully and wish \"Long live volatility\". The pandemic induced Deepak Kumar Bhardwaj Chief Investment Strategist, The Capital Investment Advisory Servicesmarket correction presents a brilliant opportunity for a long term investor to take or enhance one's equity exposure. One year from here on, many investors will be looking back at present situation and will acknowledge it as a missed opportunity. This has been the trend among investors over the past several market corrections. Markets generally tend to move in line with corporate earnings. Owing to extreme developments such as a lockdown, there could be instances that corporate earnings could take a beating. But this is a one-off. Eventually industries will come back to normalcy and earnings too will be back on track which will be reflected in the share prices as well. Conviction is the single most important factor which helps an investor tide over difficult times. Within the emerging market basket, India is unlikely to be extremely affected by the pandemic. This is largely because India is not dependent on exports unlike most of the other emerging markets. As a result, the global slowdown is likely to have a minimal impact when compared to other markets. Going forward as global allocation to the emerging market will be decided, India is likely to attract a sizeable portion of such inflows, aiding further for the markets to recover substantially. So, rather than getting unnerved by the current bout of market volatility, a smart investor should learn to make the most of such times. To conclude, it is safe to say that volatility was, is and will be there. It is difficult to imagine equity markets devoid of volatility. So, learn to embrace volatility than fighting it.

Providing an insight into this dilemma, Esha Tiwary, startup incubator and General Manager at Entrepreneur India, says, \"This is a very challenging time for early stage startups as they do not have the capital infusion to tide over an extended economic slump. It would be of great help if the government help startups to stay afloat.\" She also adds that being an incubator they are emphasizing more on the communication part. \"We are committed to supporting them through this challenging phase,\" she adds. However, Ayush Jha, Co-founder and CEO of Clairco, a Bangalore- based startup focusing on providing clean air (by turning air conditioners into purifiers) says, \"As hygiene and wellness have become the focus, air purification will be at the heart of it. We are confident that we will come out of this stronger than ever. Though there are few operational challenges at the present due to lockdown but we understand that it is temporary and for the larger good. It will take a few months for the economy to recover from the coronavirus crisis; but one must not lose sight of hope.\" unfair advantage over others. And largely sailing through will not be smooth.\" Comparing the Black Swan of 2020 with the GFC, Tiwari adds that while the timing of both the economic crashes are same, the current one is way graver than its predecessor. Nonetheless, the present digital-savvy economy with higher acceptance levels has an edge and is expected to bounce back sooner. But Tiwari quickly adds a caveat stating that the pandemic is a \"big speed breaker and not a simple roadblock.\" However, some experts differing in their opinion say that, not all startups will have to bear the brunt. In fact, certain startups focused on video communications will be on an upward spiral. On the other hand, startups catering to online groceries and edtech will be able to consolidate their ventures substantially. But startups related to travel and hospitality, food and beverages including online food delivery services will dwindle away to a great extent if not completely. On the other hand, another sect of entrepreneurs is of the opinion that economic recovery depends how soon the spread of the pandemic is contained. While it is a universal truth that in the battle between human beings' grit and an invisible virus, obviously the former will emerge victorious. But at what cost? Drawing similarities between GFC and the current pandemic leading to economic downturn, Jha adds that the only similarity that two crises share is the uncertainty factor is their rise and spread. And this is where government's role comes in. Policy responses need to be crafted accordingly since the COVID-19 is a public health crisis. Nevertheless, analysing from another perspective, startups like Clairco seem to have looking at a somewhat brighter future. While chances of raising funds and grants are somewhat better for companies like Clairco, revising and optimising operation plans LovEprEET Co Founder and Business Head, Infurnia Enterprises are hesitant in entering into any contracts and awaiting clarity on how soon the market will rebound are very much on the agenda especially keeping in mind the supply chain processes. While startups like Clairco seem to captured the rainbow visible thinly through a dense overcast sky, for some dark clouds are looming large like never before. For example, Infurnia, an architecture and interior design software startup is staring at uncertainty as the construction sector has come to a standstill owing to the pandemic. The company's Co- Founder and Business Head, Lovepreet says, \"With almost all construction activities coming to a halt, and the interior design firm coming to a standstill, we are seeing significant slowdown in sales. Enterprises are hesitant in entering into any contracts before they get more clarity on how soon and how well the market will rebound.\" Lovepreet also added that even though they have not laid off any employee so far, it would be of great help if the government steps in and creates some program similar to the Small Business Paycheck protection program launched in the United States. Kapil Jain, Founder of Graphitto Labs, a Mumbai - based communications startup says that many startups will face challenges (some already are) amid the lockdown including sharp decline in business activities over the past few weeks. Most startups were anyways working remotely, depending heavily upon the online space, often at minimal cost; however, the pandemic is all set to redefine the way even startups function. While for some the pandemic is a boon in disguise (startups like ClairCo or others focusing on video calls), for some it has already wreaked havoc. As predicted, since business tenets would be redefined in a post COVID-19 world, the country's start-up ecosystem is leaving no stone unturned to revamp strategies and innovate solutions that can help them ride the tide. And far as the future of India's startup ecosystem's trajectory is concerned - will have to wait and watch.

Providing an insight into this dilemma, Esha Tiwary, startup incubator and General Manager at Entrepreneur India, says, \"This is a very challenging time for early stage startups as they do not have the capital infusion to tide over an extended economic slump. It would be of great help if the government help startups to stay afloat.\" She also adds that being an incubator they are emphasizing more on the communication part. \"We are committed to supporting them through this challenging phase,\" she adds. However, Ayush Jha, Co-founder and CEO of Clairco, a Bangalore- based startup focusing on providing clean air (by turning air conditioners into purifiers) says, \"As hygiene and wellness have become the focus, air purification will be at the heart of it. We are confident that we will come out of this stronger than ever. Though there are few operational challenges at the present due to lockdown but we understand that it is temporary and for the larger good. It will take a few months for the economy to recover from the coronavirus crisis; but one must not lose sight of hope.\" unfair advantage over others. And largely sailing through will not be smooth.\" Comparing the Black Swan of 2020 with the GFC, Tiwari adds that while the timing of both the economic crashes are same, the current one is way graver than its predecessor. Nonetheless, the present digital-savvy economy with higher acceptance levels has an edge and is expected to bounce back sooner. But Tiwari quickly adds a caveat stating that the pandemic is a \"big speed breaker and not a simple roadblock.\" However, some experts differing in their opinion say that, not all startups will have to bear the brunt. In fact, certain startups focused on video communications will be on an upward spiral. On the other hand, startups catering to online groceries and edtech will be able to consolidate their ventures substantially. But startups related to travel and hospitality, food and beverages including online food delivery services will dwindle away to a great extent if not completely. On the other hand, another sect of entrepreneurs is of the opinion that economic recovery depends how soon the spread of the pandemic is contained. While it is a universal truth that in the battle between human beings' grit and an invisible virus, obviously the former will emerge victorious. But at what cost? Drawing similarities between GFC and the current pandemic leading to economic downturn, Jha adds that the only similarity that two crises share is the uncertainty factor is their rise and spread. And this is where government's role comes in. Policy responses need to be crafted accordingly since the COVID-19 is a public health crisis. Nevertheless, analysing from another perspective, startups like Clairco seem to have looking at a somewhat brighter future. While chances of raising funds and grants are somewhat better for companies like Clairco, revising and optimising operation plans LovEprEET Co Founder and Business Head, Infurnia Enterprises are hesitant in entering into any contracts and awaiting clarity on how soon the market will rebound are very much on the agenda especially keeping in mind the supply chain processes. While startups like Clairco seem to captured the rainbow visible thinly through a dense overcast sky, for some dark clouds are looming large like never before. For example, Infurnia, an architecture and interior design software startup is staring at uncertainty as the construction sector has come to a standstill owing to the pandemic. The company's Co- Founder and Business Head, Lovepreet says, \"With almost all construction activities coming to a halt, and the interior design firm coming to a standstill, we are seeing significant slowdown in sales. Enterprises are hesitant in entering into any contracts before they get more clarity on how soon and how well the market will rebound.\" Lovepreet also added that even though they have not laid off any employee so far, it would be of great help if the government steps in and creates some program similar to the Small Business Paycheck protection program launched in the United States. Kapil Jain, Founder of Graphitto Labs, a Mumbai - based communications startup says that many startups will face challenges (some already are) amid the lockdown including sharp decline in business activities over the past few weeks. Most startups were anyways working remotely, depending heavily upon the online space, often at minimal cost; however, the pandemic is all set to redefine the way even startups function. While for some the pandemic is a boon in disguise (startups like ClairCo or others focusing on video calls), for some it has already wreaked havoc. As predicted, since business tenets would be redefined in a post COVID-19 world, the country's start-up ecosystem is leaving no stone unturned to revamp strategies and innovate solutions that can help them ride the tide. And far as the future of India's startup ecosystem's trajectory is concerned - will have to wait and watch.

Similar, or rather more severe than that has happened in the Indian financial market last week. The lockdown imposed as a containment measure to stop the spread of COVID-19 pandemic has taken its first toll in the Indian financial market. The closure of its six debt schemes by the Franklin Templeton (FT) Mutual Fund has resulted in eroding the confidence of investors to a large extent and has created a sort of crisis of confidence in the market. These six debt schemes together have more than `28,000 crore Assets Under Management (AUM). Through a notice dated April 23, 2020, FT MF announced its decision to wind up six of its schemes; Franklin India Low Duration Fund, Franklin India Ultra Short Bond Fund, Franklin India Short Term Income Plan, Franklin India Credit Risk Fund, Franklin India Dynamic Accrual Fund and Franklin India Income Opportunities Fund.

Banks can avail of 90-day funds from the RBI's repo window and use it to lend exclusively to mutual funds or purchase investment grade corporate papers held by MFs. The scheme will be available from April 27 to May 11. This is third instance when the central bank has opened a special window for the MFs. Joseph Thomas, Head of Research - Emkay Wealth Management says, \"The erosion in investor confidence usually results in more redemptions and may lead to liquidity problems for the mutual fund industry, when many of them already have negative cash in debt funds.

The company, which is into manufacturing of branded and packaged FMCG products, saw an increase in demand for home and hygiene related products due to the present pandemic. Despite COVID-19 crisis, analysts continue to remain positive with its volume growth on account of strong demand for its products. The company's net sales and net profit have clocked a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 4 per cent and 7 per cent respectively. That said, the company's third quarter (Q3) performance for financial year (FY) 2020 was broadly in line with most broking firms' estimates. The total sales rose 4 per cent during the quarter as its domestic consumer business grew by 4 per cent year-on-year. The company's segmental revenue for the nine-month-ended December 31, 2019 increased by 5.3 per cent Y-o-Y. Out of this, the home care segment contributed to 35 per cent of the revenue, beauty and personal care by 45 per cent, foods and refreshment contributed to 19 per cent and other products by 1 per cent. On the operating front, the Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) grew 19.2 per cent Y-o-Y on back of improved operating leverage. \"Factors that have led to the company's Playing A Very Defensive Game Analysts are positive on HUL's growth strong earnings performance like nimbleness, stringent cost savings, premiumisation and best-of- breed analytics are likely to benefit it in the future as well, \" says an analyst at Motilal Oswal Financial Services. That said, the company in the month of April 2020, completed its merger with GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (GSKCH) with a consideration of total equity value of `31,700 crore for 100 per cent of GSKCH India. In addition to that, HUL has also paid `3,045 crore to acquire the Horlicks brand for India from GSK. In March 2020 it has also announced the acquisition of VWash brand from Glenmark Pharma. \"With HUL's extensive distribution reach of 7+ million outlets and direct distribution of 3.5+ million retail outlets, we believe it would be able to market VWash on a much wider scale across geographies. This would help the product grow faster with the company, going forward, \" points out an analyst at ICICI Direct. Considering the extraordinary economic slowdown, HUL, going forward, is likely to sustain a robust revenue growth and continue to dominate a premium to the peers being the leader in the category. \"We currently estimate 15 per cent PAT CAGR over FY20-22 (post-merger) and value the stock at 46xFY22 pro- forma earnings per share (EPS) of `46.4, thus assigning a target price of `2,136 (Quoted as on April 1, 2020), \" says an analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher. The company remains one of the best defensive players in the current uncertain environment as per various broking firms. Why Buy Consistent growth with maximum range of new generation products Its acquisition of VWash from Glenmark Pharma bodes well for the brand Watch out for Volatile commodities on the back of sluggish market growth can impact marginsAlthough COVID-19 pandemic might have discounted two quarters of de-growth in earnings, many market experts and analysts believe that blue-chip stocks like HDFC Bank are trading at attractive valuations, offering once in a decade opportunity. Being one of India's leading private banks that offers a diverse range of financial products, HDFC Bank has a proven track record of not only good earnings but is also backed by a strong risk management system. Further, many brokerage houses are expecting HDFC Bank to remain unfazed by COVID-19, thereby expecting to post a 30 per cent growth earnings in its net profit in fourth quarter (Q4) for financial year (FY) 2020. As of December 31, 2019, the bank enjoys a wide distribution network spread across 5,345 banking outlets and aiding customers with 14,533 ATMs/ Cash Deposit & Withdrawal Machines (CDMs) across 2,787 cities/ towns. On the financial front, HDFC Bank's net profit and Interest earned have clocked a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 15.9 per cent and 15.7 per cent respectively over FY 2015-2019. \"We believe the bank will be able to gain market share driven by strong leadership position across segments, large distribution, digital focus and strong capital adequacy, \" says an analyst at IDBI Capital. When it comes to the bank's net revenues for Q3 FY2020, it posted a 19 per cent growth at `20,842.2 crore as compare to corresponding quarter of the previous year. Sailing Through The COVID-19 Storm Brokerages expect the bank to post a 30% growth On the quality front, the bank witnessed a marginal slip in its Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) at 1.42 per cent of gross advances as on Q3 FY2020 as compared to 1.38 per cent in Q3 FY 2019. Further the Net NPA stood at 0.48 per cent of net advances as on Q3 FY2020. \" Asset quality is expected to remain under pressure. However, growth in advances and deposit despite weak economic environment should drive the company's performance, \" cautions an analyst at Geojit Financial Services. The Net Interest Income (NII) rose 13 per cent in Q3 backed by the growth in advances of 19.9 per cent and a growth in deposits of 25.2 per cent. However, the Net Interest Margin (NIM) for the quarter stood stable at 4.2 per cent. That said, HDFC Bank's cost- to-income ratio for the quarter stood at 37.9 per cent in Q3 FY2020 as against 38.4 per cent in Q3 FY2019. The bank's continuous focus on deposits has been a key catalyst for the maintenance of a healthy liquidity coverage ratio at 140 per cent, that is well above the regulatory requirement. \"Over the past 10 years, HDFC Bank has steadily grown its loans market share to ~8.5 per cent of the system, driven by steady branch addition, improving employee productivity and effective use of technology to gain distribution efficiency.

Analysts gauge companies using DCF models and parameters such as ROE, P/BV and P/E. Sector-based model portfolios created by analysts are compiled by the research head to create market-cap-based model portfolios that serve as guides to the portfolio managers. The skilled management team's participation aids the process in no small measure. Anand Radhakrishnan seeks companies with clean balance sheets. He looks for steady businesses with sustainable competitive advantages that can generate healthy ROEs and ROCEs. He focuses on profitability using EVA as a measure. A contrarian streak is perceptible in the manager's stock picks. Radhakrishnan will pare/exit positions he believes are expensive. That said, the strategy is not without risks. His valuation-conscious approach and inability to play momentum will hold the fund back during speculative or bull markets. The fund also struggled owing to a few investment calls that could have been best avoided. A more prudent approach would help in this regard. The fund's portfolio largely remains stable in terms of allocation, nature, style, and diversification.

As belt tightening happened, raises and bonuses were held up and jobs were at threat. I saw Mr Grasshopper walking into the office a week later, no car and no swagger. He was behind on his EMI so all the furniture in his house and his car was repossessed. That is when I realised his whole life was a house of cards, built on unsustainable debt and just in time EMI payments. At the first sign of trouble his entire edifice of debt collapsed around him. Within a month he was without a job and had moved back into his parents' house to save costs. Mr Desi Ant came to see me a few days later. I asked him how things were, given the general gloom in the economy and reduced expenditure all around. He said he paid cash down for all his purchases, used every dollar of tax planning available to his business and was in fact buying more cabs in the downturn. He had seen many cycles from Nixon to Ford to Carter to Reagan and George Bush Sr. He prepared for cycles and for success through sagacity and frugality. That talk was one of the most important lessons in money management and financial planning that I ever got. As I rose to be the Chairman of the Financial Planning Standards Board of India and to head many venerable institutions, those lessons in hard work, perseverance, grit, determination, clarity of objectives and humility have helped me navigate through the good and bad times. Both stories have a happy ending. Mr Grasshopper went into business with a former client and married his daughter (I forget if the marriage came first or the business, it's been 30 years now!). The India offshoring miracle happened in a few years and it was one of the few businesses in the world where you had a massive cost advantage. He got in at the right time and the rest as they say, was history. He has not changed much. Mr Desi Ant is a dear friend and a sounding board. He still goes to office, still runs a tight ship in various businesses that he has acquired. He gives a lot to charity and to immigrant welfare. I call him for advice and for getting infected with his Within a year of starting work for a multinational, I was sent to New York in the 1990s for training at the headquarters. We used to get $20 per diem in which we had to manage our food costs for the day. All the other expenses were borne by the employer. There was this intern working with us, who used to drive into the firms parking lot in a swanky Mercedes. The CEO of the firm, who has been hailed as one of the best bankers of the 20th century, used to use the NY subway. We were fascinated by the lifestyle of this intern. He had a magical aura around him of opulence and privilege. Our self-pressed polyester shirts and ties and Bata shoes were the subject of snubs. And the one credit card we had worked only in India and Nepal. Having to pay cash everywhere was seen as so pass\u00e9. We will call him Mr Grasshopper. In New York I met Mr Desi Ant also. Like me, he was a Punjabi from a refugee family who lost everything in the 1947 partition of India. Through a cousin he somehow made it to the US, started waiting tables in the cousin's restaurant. Within a year he had started driving a cab and then went on acquire many cab licenses, which were a gold mine in those pre Uber / Lyft days. When I met him, he was a platinum customer who still drove sometimes, but was managing a huge transportation operation of Punjabi and Pakistani cab drivers. His children were all Ivy League educated - one a doctor and another a lawyer. Mr Grasshopper would talk derogatorily about Mr Desi Ant, mimicking his accent, his gruff mannerisms and his lack of education. Mr Desi Ant would like to spend time with us youngsters and share stories of people he had driven and things he had seen. More on that some other day. He had a great story on the market crash of 1987. Then one July a US Congressman cast doubts on the firm's solvency. Things had been challenging with the savings and Earn, spend wisely, do extreme savings and invest for long termAJAY BAGGA www.outlookmoney.com May 2020 Outlook Money 63 47 Outlook Money May 2020 www.outlookmoney.comStandpoint optimism and sheer love for life and success at all he touches. I like stories that end with \" And they lived happily ever After\" . For both my friends, the story ended well. I was thinking of them as I see people all around us losing jobs, panicking about the future and worrying about their investments. Crisis/ crash/ recessions are a great time to reassess our core values. What do we want out of our life? What defines us as human beings? What would we like to be our legacy? How do we safeguard our future and those of our loved ones? These are good questions to think about. There are no right or wrong answers; there are answers that are good for you as determined by you. A critical question you can evaluate at this time is - What is your relationship with Money? Do you want to be the Mr Grasshopper or Mr Desi Ant? Or some mixture of the two, or maybe, something totally different from both. If you can clarify your values towards money, that is a huge achievement. Then you will drive the process of money management for yourself, rather than being a cog in the great wheel of Samsara. If we can recognise there is a huge world that wants to market our products, services, dreams, promises in exchange for our money, we will be able to be more objective in spending our money. At no point am I asking you to be miserly. But there is a pride in being frugal. I will give you two examples. The first is legendary investor and one of the richest men in the world, Warren Buffett. Like in his investments, he is careful to the point of being frugal in spending his fortune, but he has donated more than $46 billion to philanthropic causes since 2000. He still lives in the house he bought in the 1950s and drives an equally modest car. Buffett prefers to reinvest and grow his money, rather than take it out of the bank. Not one for lavish purchases, he spends relatively little of his billions - except when it comes to philanthropy. Another is someone who has given huge amounts to charity in India. I will not name him as he likes to be very self-effacing. I used to run a project offering corporate digital salaried accounts to firms. His company was a customer. In those pre big data/pre algo times, he made me do analysis on what were his employees spending most on. We worked out discounts with major retailers for each of those categories, so the purchasing rupee of his employees was stretched. He drove an old car and stayed very modestly. More lessons from him in future columns. I would like to end with this advice. Yes times are bad. Learn. Work on ensuring that you earn money, spend wisely, do extreme savings and invest in a diversified manner for the very long term. That is the simple, but not easy to do, mantra for financial independence and financial liberation. My life style has not changed in this lockdown except for not being able to go to TV studios, speak at conferences or go for the rare meeting. I use digital platforms to do all my meetings now and find much more time and energy available for doing what I love doing the most - meditating, reading and thinking. Follow the money mantra I have shared with you. So that you can also achieve this financial liberation. It is priceless.

While he hopes to get some decent returns from this policy in the long run, his primary reason to start it was to save tax. He claims a deduction of `50,000 every year under Section 80C on his policy. Asked whether he would have taken this plan had his income not been taxable, or if there was no income tax deduction on this scheme, he says he may have then opted to spend some of that money, or invested in an FD.

He adds that for most taxpayers, foregoing exemptions is not going to be beneficial as the exemptions under the existing tax regime are substantial. So they may opt for the old tax regime as long as they have that option.

He says that the new age educated consumer buys insurance for a variety of reasons, the tax incentives is one of the reasons but not the only motivation. \"Given the long-term nature of insurance products catering to both savings and mortality risk cover needs of individuals, the impact on their appeal will be limited. People are becoming more aware of the long-term benefits of insurance that can play a key role in financial planning for any individual. In India, there is a general awareness now that in a country where social security is available only to some, purchase of health insurance, life insurance and term insurance is a mandatory requirement for securing individual financial security as well as for the family, \" he explains. In this new alternative arrangement of removing tax exemption there is a lesson for the industry also, which needs to recalibrate its sales pitch. \"Going forward insurance should be sold as a savings and protection tool rather than a tax saving instrument. India is a huge market and still has a large pool of populace which is either in- insured or under-insured, therefore there is ample room for insurers to grow and thrive their business albeit with a different sales approach going forward, \" Agarwal says. The industry at this point is hopeful that a large section of their customer base would not opt for the new tax regime. They, however, maintain that removing tax incentives given for putting money in insurance is a disservice to the customers. When it comes to health insurance, healthcare expenses are rising annually and at a rate much higher than the general rate of inflation. The cost of treatment or medication is becoming a major burden on individual budgets. According to Shreeraj Deshpande, Chief Operating Officer, Future Generali India Insurance Company, health insurance protections need to be perceived as a need by every individual rather than being bought for tax purposes. \"In view of the ever rising cost of medical expenses we are already seeing an increased number of persons buying insurance cover. A person who does not have an insurance cover should ensure you purchase a suitable cover. Persons who already have health insurance cover should ensure adequacy of the cover, \" he says. Ashutosh Shrotriya, Head- Products and Business Process, Religare Health Insurance, feels most individuals buy health insurance to financially prepare themselves against unforeseen medical exigencies and not merely to save taxes. \"Therefore in our opinion, health insurance as an industry may not necessarily get impacted as a result of the revised tax-regime. However, a more realistic impact can only be assessed only post analysing how many individuals opt for the regime. \" Most industry insiders feel that for short duration, till everyone does calculation of implication of new tax regime versus the old on their own income tax, people will be confused and the impact could be unknown. However, in the short term, the impact on insurance products which have some tax saving component will be more compared to other insurance products like motor, health and term insurance. \" As these are pure protection and asset protection products having no tax saving mindset in consumer's mind, \" says Divyanshu Tripathi, CEO and Co-Founder, Easypolicy. \" All the calculations that I have done on different salary bands, I have seen that savings on income tax is much better with old slabs and citizens will end up paying more if they go for new slabs without exemptions. So, my suggestion would be to do proper calculation and draw comparison between old and new slabs with and without exemptions before opting for any slab or in case help needed to do this then they should consult CAs or financial planners for the same, \" he advises. In India, every incentive should be given to enable people to buy health insurance and there should also be an awareness programme to educate people about the benefits of buying insurance, concludes Nivesh Khandelwal, CEO, CareCover. vishav@outlookindia.com Health insurance as an industry may not necessarily get impacted ASHUTOSH SHROTRIYA Head-Products and Business Process, Religare Health InsuranceDo proper calculation and draw comparison between the old and new slabs available DIVYANSHU TRIPATHI CEO and Co-Founder, EasypolicyNew Tax Regime 90 Outlook Money May 2020 www.outlookmoney.comWhy does it become all the more important to get an insurance cover in the current situation?

A regular health policy, on the other hand, will cover you for most viral infections requiring hospitalization.

Sectors like tourism and hospitality, will have to cope with abnormal changes in consumer behaviour. However, the global economy will eventually bounce back. It always does. There will also be new opportunities. Given that millions are working from home, there is likely to be investment into tools that enable working from home efficiently. Figuring out how to deal with the next pandemic will also mean that labour-intensive industries might arrive at more sanitary ways to run businesses. The entertainment and sports industry will find better ways to deliver content remotely. There will be real-time reviews of public-transport systems, of healthcare, and many other sectors. If the stock market dips further, consider buying more. Historically, the Nifty and Sensex has rarely fallen below an average Price Earning (PE) of 15. The current PE is about 20, and given poor results in the next six months, the market should fall more. But it will rebound. If you hold SIPs, let them continue as they reduce average cost of acquisition and boost eventual returns. If you wish to create hedges, there are two options\u2014 gold and short-term commodities. The painless way to invest in the former is through exchange traded funds. But you can also buy the physical metal, or invest in NBFCs, which offer loans against gold. Gold is usually a safe haven during periods of crisis as it could preserve value during a long recession. Second, consider short-term trades in commodities if you can handle high risks and volatility. Epicentre of COVID-19, China, is also a global industrial hub. Since its huge domestic market was shut down, as a result, industrial metals and petroleum have been sold down. However, while the crisis in China is easing off, it is getting worse in the rest of the world. Once that giant economy starts functioning properly again, there could be a rebound in metals and other commodies. All we can do is to remain optimistic and await recovery. Until that happens, stay home, stay safe! The author tracks economic, behavioural and corporate trends, hoping to gauge good avenues of returnsIn the realm of economic slang, a black swan is an event that is utterly unexpected until it happens. The metaphor appeared in 17th century when Europeans discovered black swans in Australia. Until then they believed that the the world has only white swans. The coronavirus or COVID-19, is a black swan. The world has often been swept by lethal epidemics like Ebola, H1N1 (Swine flu) and severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS\u201421st century successors to Spanish Flu (1918) and smallpox. There are dozens of infectious, but less deadly diseases, like the common cold and flu. However, contagious diseases like the flu and cold have low mortality rates. Now, the coronavirus is an all-rounder. It is less deadly than Ebola but 10-30 times deadly than the flu and of course infectious. By the time you read this column, we will have a better sense of the impact on the global economy. But the disease has already triggered a worldwide recession. Billions in lockdown for weeks equals severe economic damage. Many people will soon be out of work. Factories are shut; farms are not being able to sell produce and non-essential services are locked down. When the lockdown eases, there will be a hangover caused by low demand because unemployed people spend less. In late March as this column is being written, nobody knows how long this will last. That is why financial markets are going crazy. Investors constantly look for a sense of the future and a black swan makes it unpredictable. There is one primary rule to investing in such situations: do not panic. The stock market has fallen and it is likely to fall more. The rupee has nose-dived. As a professional you are likely to go through hard times for sure. But, do not panic. The world has survived more fatal pandemics. It will survive this one and will make the changes required to cope with the next such pandemic.

One should also have an exposure to equity as per as the asset allocation. However, lower interest rate may pose a challenge to senior citizens. 2019 was already a year of rate cuts and with COVID-19, the returns on fixed deposits will experience a noticeable drop.

However, when it comes to managing their finances Indian millennials somewhere miss out on major pointers. Yes. In an effort to realise their life goals, they often look for loans despite a low credit score. And numbers of such individuals are increasing with each passing day. Tapping into this very demographic space, Bangalore -based fintech company ZestMoney has been successfully lending out the required financial support to lakhs of millennials and Gen Z. Speaking to Outlook Money, the fintech's founding trio say, \"We believe in providing affordable, digital, small ticket consumer credit to the masses. \" They further go on to mention that, a certain data share by the Reserve Bank of India, states that annually, roughly 4.5 crore credit cards are issued in India annually. However, a lot of duplicity is often reported in the process. Given the duplicity and dormancy, that suggests around two crore people are actively using credit cards (maybe less), which is less than five per cent of the adult population, a minuscule number in a global context. At the same time, UPI adoption is skyrocketing and we believe more than 40 crore people are transacting and interacting online today. For these people, a new form of finance is needed, they further add. \"This is what we focussed (new form of finance) on and hence decided to leverage, \" says Sharma, chief operating officer, ZestMoney. Priya Sharma, Lizzie Chapman and Ashish Ananatharaman, the trio first met while working at Wonga\u2014a London-based payday loan provider. Later when Chapman moved to India, the three met yet again only to zero in on a certain business idea and then the rest, as they say\u2014is history. However, unlike Wonga and its ilk, ZestMoney is very much a consumer- centric loans company. That is to say that it works with consumers who have no credit card, limited credit history and often very little assessable data, to help them build a profile and become 'creditworthy. ' Operational since 2016, the firm has successfully disbursed crores of short-term loans to thousands of Indians. One of the biggest benefits of availing small loans through ZestMoney is the ease of process. All that a user needs to do is to login and register at the site with a vaild email adress, complete his or her profile, check for the relevant scredit score and then proceeed with whatever her personal requirement is. What sets apart the fintech firm are its two major services\u2014shopping and direct payment at e-commerce platforms and of course availing short-term loans sans the major paperwork. Let us understand, how the two services work. In case of the former, a user will have to login, register, complete the profile, upload documents such as an identity and address proof, and start using the credit limit across ZestMoney's thousand merchant partners; after purchasing the desired product, make payment using the given credit limit. On the other hand, when it comes to availing personal loans, what users will have to do is other than, login, registering and sharing KYC documents, shop something from any one of the partner e-commerce sites and make consistent repayments. This way the user will be eligible to avail a loan. Depending upon the requirement, the fintech may ask its customers to set up the repayment based on his or her risk profile. Sharing more about ZestMoney's customer base, its founders state that, while there's no age bar in terms of the target audience, however, most of their customers happen to be young professionals within 35. While both men and women form a large base of customers, of late the percentage of the latter has increased to a great extent. In fact, in certain loan segments, such as education loans, women customers have surpassed their male counterparts substantially. By Sampurna Majumder ZestMoney is helping people avail loans despite a low or no credit scoreChapman, its CEO. Keeping this target audience in mind, the platform aims at benefiting over 5,00,000 potential students. \"The financing can be availed at zero interest cost, making higher education affordable for everyone, \" she adds. In order to realise this goal, the tech company has already tied up with online educational platforms such as GreatLearning, BITS Pilani, UPGrad and Springboard. When it comes to geographical reach of its customers, ZestMoney has no barriers. While most of its current clientele hail from Tier I cities, other cities are also fast picking up. Within a span of three years, ZestMoney has already brought in 10,000 pin codes under its ambit with further plans of expansion. As far as visitors are considered, on a daily basis, the website registers in thousands, at times closer to a lakh. \"Every day, almost 20,000 customers apply for loans on our platform, \" says Ananatharaman, who serves as the fintech's chief technology officer. Till now, ZestMoney has served over six crore customers and by the end of 2019, the tech company almost hit the `4000 crore mark in terms of annual run rate. While ZestMoney is successfully achieving its original goal settings, they are also well aware of responsibility towards the society. Though the company is yet to weave in a full- fledged corporate social responsibility program, they do their bit in ways such as volunteering with local government schools where they help students understand the importance of financial education from an early age. Believing in the dictum that there is no short cut to success, ZestMoney wants to become the most-loved brands in India within the fintech space. Their hard work has already started reflecting the desired results. While it received the Fintech of the Year award in 2017 by India Fintech Forum, Entrepreneur India named ZestMoney as one of the 50 Start-ups to look out for in 2019. sampurna@outlookindia.com A survey conducted by ZestMoney last year, reveals that 20 per cent education loans were availed by women whereas men comprised barely six per cent within the same. The research also found that average loan amount for women is 35 per cent higher than men. In 2019, the average amount of EMI financing taken by women were around Rs 20,000, whereas for men the amount was `15,000.

While it received the Fintech of the Year award in 2017 by India Fintech Forum, Entrepreneur India named ZestMoney as one of the 50 Start-ups to look out for in 2019. sampurna@outlookindia.com A survey conducted by ZestMoney last year, reveals that 20 per cent education loans were availed by women whereas men comprised barely six per cent within the same. The research also found that average loan amount for women is 35 per cent higher than men. In 2019, the average amount of EMI financing taken by women were around Rs 20,000, whereas for men the amount was `15,000. One of the major segments, that ZestMoney has been able to leverage upon is the education loans segment. \"Young professionals aspiring for higher education often face a dearth of financial assistance. This is because mostly, it comes with a premium attached, making the decision tougher than it ought to be, \" says Return Visitors 50% Funding (so far)) $57 millionFounded 2016 Location Bangalore Priya Sharma, Lizzie Cha Pman and aShiSh ananatharamanWe believe in providing affordable, digital, small ticket consumer credit ZestMoney Flash Facts 74 Outlook Money May 2020 www.outlookmoney.com www.outlookmoney.com May 2020 Outlook Money 75Fintech Watch76 Outlook Money May 2020 www.outlookmoney.com 60 Outlook Money May 2020 www.outlookmoney.com www.outlookmoney.com May 2020 Outlook Money 61they should continue to pay their EMI installments during these three months as well. The verdict is not completely straight-forward. The moratorium would make sense for those individuals whose capacity to pay their EMIs has been substantially hit. Those who can pay their EMIs comfortably should continue to do so as opting for a moratorium would only add more liability for them. Explaining this, Archit Gupta, Founder, and CEO, ClearTax, says that if an individual avails a housing loan of `50 lakh at an interest rate of 8.5 per cent in March and decides to opt for the moratorium, then the principal amount after the first month of the moratorium would increase by `35,000 bringing the outstanding loan amount to `50,35,000. And since he would incur compounded interest, the interest applicable for the second and third months would be even higher. At the end of the moratorium period, the total amount payable would have increased by `1.07 lakh. Now after the end of the moratorium period, depending on the bank, the borrower can either pay this interest amount upfront, can pay higher EMIs, or would have to pay EMIs for a longer duration as interest would accrue on this increased amount every month. For instance, in the given example, for a loan tenure of 30 years, the extra interest to be paid would amount to around ` 3 lakh for someone who opts for the moratorium if they increase the EMI amount keeping the loan tenure same. The increase in EMI would only be ` 822 per month. The scenario becomes worse for someone who decides not to increase the EMI amount because in such a case, the tenure of the loan would increase and one would end up paying extra interest worth over ` 9.5 lakh. Rahul Agarwal, Director, Wealth Think carefully before you opt for any loan moratorium as it would only lead to a higher liabilityResolving The Installment Dilemma Those who can pay their EMIs comfortably should continue to do soWith the whole nation under lockdown to slow down the exponential spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), businesses have been hit which has led to a disruption of financial liquidity for a lot of people. Things may have become especially worse for those who have taken loans of one or the other kind had it not been for the RBI's intervention. Paying Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs) of those loans would have been a nightmare for some of the borrowers whose finances have been affected by an unprecedented nationwide lockdown. However, coming to their rescue, the Reserve Bank of India instructed banks to grant an optional three-month moratorium on all outstanding loans to all borrowers on their EMIs. This essentially means that borrowers can defer their EMI installments that are due for payment till May 31, 2020, without any penalties or any impact on their credit scores. Loans ranging from home loans, personal loans, car loans, corporate loans, agriculture loans, and even credit card loans availed from commercial, regional, rural, NBFCs, and small finance banks come under this scheme. However, those availing this optional moratorium would have to pay the interest for this additional three-month period. Due to this, many questions have arisen among people regarding whether it makes sense for them to opt for this moratorium or whether Discovery, and EZ Wealth says that the guidelines issued by most of the banks and NBFCs mention that unpaid interest amount on the loan account during this moratorium period will be capitalised, that is, added to one's outstanding principal amount. Also, few lenders have stated that the EMI will remain the same as original and the loan tenure will be adjusted accordingly. For example, Bajaj Finance has issued a communiqu\u00e9 which states, that to keep one's instalment at the current levels, the tenure of their loan will be enhanced accordingly, Agarwal explains. \" As a result, while their EMI amount will remain the same, the amount of interest cost on the loan will increase due to the extension of the remaining tenure. Some other lenders have issued statements that the loan tenure will be shifted by only three months but the EMIs will be recalculated to adjust the interest portion outstanding during the moratorium period. Individuals are therefore advised to contact their lenders and understand what are the options that have been made available to them, \" he suggests. However, this moratorium can be a massive relief for the self-employed borrowers since their income has taken a hit due to the lockdown in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic, says Gupta. \"Borrowers can either choose to opt for the moratorium or continue their EMI payments. However, it entirely depends on the certainty of having a regular income for the next three months. As far as we know, we are not aware if the pandemic has hit bottom or not. Availing the moratorium can be the right choice for people who do not have an adequate amount of liquidity for the next three months. For those who are doubtful about their income during the next three months, borrowers can consider opting for the moratorium for a month and then decide whether to continue the benefit or not, depending on the situation, \" Gupta explains. Ravindra Sudhalkar, CEO, Reliance Home Finance, also feels that the moratorium facility should be availed only if there is any possibility of non- payment of EMIs due to loss of income or disruptions in cash flow during the period between March 1 and May 31 and that people with steady income sources should continue to pay their EMIs as per their current plan. \"Banks and financial institutions have been allowed to come up with their own set of norms for implementation of the moratorium option for specific loans.

Sudhalkar added that since part and full loan repayments are allowed in all variable rate home loans without any penalty, anyone who avails this moratorium should make some bulk payment whenever the cash flow situation eases to ensure he or she does not pay a huge amount of extra interest on the loan. Salaried individuals who do not have any impact on salary should not defer the EMIs. For self-employed, even if the cash flows are impacted, if the EMI amount can be paid comfortably, one must not opt for the moratorium. While the RBI governor announced the moratorium facility mandating it for all banks to give this option to their borrowers, the apex bank left it to each bank to formulate its policy around the same. This has also led to some complexities and confusions as different banks decided to go their way in implementing this facility, Sousthav Chakrabarty, CEO, and Director, Capital Quotient, says. \"For instance, some banks decided to give a default moratorium option to all its home loan customers indicating that even if one can pay the EMI, they would get the moratorium on their loan and the onus would be on the client to inform the bank that they do not require it. Some other banks decided to leave it to the customers to opt for the facility barring which their EMIs would be deducted in a normal fashion. So, customers affected by COVID-19 and unable to pay their liability, have to contact their lender bank for more clarity on terms and conditions, \" Chakrabarty says. The important thing to understand here is that this is not an EMI waiver, warns Harsh Jain, Co-founder, and COO, Groww. Usually, when people hear about the government extending benefits during the time of crisis, a waiver is a natural assumption. Hence, people must remember that the RBI has only allowed the banks to offer an EMI deferment - not waiver. According to Jain, since each bank has formulated its policy to offer this EMI holiday facility to its customers, people should check with their banks first. \"If given a choice, it would be better for people to add the additional interest amount in the total amount payable to the bank and repay it in parts along with the EMIs. This will ensure that they do not take the additional load of trying to repay the interest and bring their repayment schedule back on track. A situation like a pandemic can take some time to be brought under control. Therefore, people should avoid making an upfront payment, \" he says. While the moratorium is available on all term loans and credit cards, Jain recommends avoiding taking the EMI moratorium on credit card payments since in such cases, credit card outstanding will jump higher over the three months of the moratorium due to very high-interest rates. \"You can opt for a moratorium on other term loans like home loans, and personal loans, \" he says. According to EZ Wealth's Agarwal, if one is short of cash flow to meet all of the financial obligations, they need to prioritise the obligations, continue to pay those which have the highest negative impact on their future cash outflows. \"For example, your first priority should be to pay your credit card outstanding on time after that if you have leftover funds you should pay other unsecured loans which carry higher interests and then think of paying the EMI on term loans outstanding. While the burden could be manageable for home loan borrowers given the prevailing benign interest rate regime, this may not be the case with credit card users. Being unsecured loans, the interest charged is exorbitant, which can be upwards of 40 per cent per annum in most cases and could balloon to an unmanageable amount if you do not make attempts to clear the dues, \" he concludes. vishav@outlookindia.comRBI has only allowed banks to offer an EMI deferment, not waiver HARSH JAIN CO-founder & COO, GrowwLoan Moratorium - Things To Know The moratorium is an option to suspend payments Interest would continue to accrue on all outstanding loans Those with sufficient cash flow should continue to pay EMIs Those who are cash strapped or are staring at job loss should opt for it Prioritise obligations, continue to pay high-interest loans like credit card bills Ask the bank about how it would affect your EMI amount and loan tenure If you avail the moratorium, make some bulk payment and increase EMI amount whenever cash flow situation eases EMI Moratoriumwww.outlookmoney.com May 2020 Outlook Money 79Investsense www.outlookmoney.com May 2020 Outlook Money 69Common misconceptions need to be cleared regarding mutual fund investments will have to pay tax on it as per the tax slab. While it is good for one who falls within low or nil tax slabs (as the dividends will be tax-free or at very low tax incident) investors falling under a high tax slab (say 30 per cent plus surcharge) the tax on dividends will be expensive. High-income group investors will now be better off in growth options rather than toy around with a dividend option. In growth option the investor will have to pay 10 per cent tax on the gains on redemptions that too the first `1 lakh gain is exempted. Therefore, dividends do not make sense as compared to growth options. However, if one needs the dividends periodically as a supplement to one's income say after retirement, then I would rather recommend a Systematic Withdrawal Plan. This is more tax efficient and the capital would also grow alongside. Second, I will address the issue of a lower NAV being cheaper than a higher NAV in a mutual fund. This is a very common fallacy in the investor community. Let's say fund A has just been launched in a new fund offer (NFO) and has a NAV of ` 10 per unit like in the case of every NFO and fund B has been launched five years back and has a NAV of `15 per unit. Logically, the NAV of fund A is lower than fund B and hence is cheaper. Well, in this case the assumption is wrong because fund B has been in existence for a longer period and hence its NAV is different. The NAV pricing has no bearing to the future performance of the funds. Performance can be compared of funds in similar periods regardless of the NAVs. Always choose a fund on the basis of performance and other parameters but never on the basis of NAVs. I hope I have been able to clear the misconception of dividends Vs Growth and the expensive Vs cheap funds basis the cost differential of the NAVs in this article. Happy Investing. The author is a wealth advisor and Founder, Tangerine IdeasFor some of my clients receiving quarterly profits from mutual funds is a high, which is a proof that their investments are yielding results. In reality they might not be in need for funds; however, they feel good to receive the amount of money at regular interval in their bank account. I am at my wits end with such clients explaining that their principal is growing at a very slow pace within a dividend plan, defeating the purpose of investing for capital growth. Albeit most of these clients invest these dividends into mutual funds after six months but they do not seem to have understood the power of compounding, which works wonders in a mutual fund in a growth plan. They have argued many a times saying that a bird in hand is worth two in a bush. In other words, my clients maintain that the hard cash in bank account is a tangible profit whereas the growth in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the fund is intangible and is therefore of no consequence. I am penning this article with a hope to try and address this issue. Yet another issue, which I try making investors understand (often in vain) is that NAV of a fund is not an indicator of how cheap or expensive that fund is. These are two fundamental points of mutual fund investments but at times we need to brush up our basic knowledge in terms of mutual fund investments. Budget 2020 abolished the dividend distribution tax deduction by the fund houses. Now the onus of paying the tax is on investors. Earlier no matter, which tax slab investors used to be in, the fund houses would deduct 10 per cent along with surcharge and pay the proceeds to the investor tax free in their hands. Now, however, the dividends will get added to the investor's income without any deduction by the fund house and the investor SANDIP MUKHERJI At times brushing up knowledge of mutual funds is necessaryDoubt Till You Find The Light 80 Outlook Money May 2020 www.outlookmoney.com 66 Outlook Money May 2020 www.outlookmoney.com www.outlookmoney.com May 2020 Outlook Money 67 Sreekanth analysed their investment portfolio and undertook the following actions: 1) The portfolio was considered to be rebalanced to ensure sufficient liquid funds by the time such funds were required. 2) The relative valuation of different schemes was reviewed to select the schemes to be redeemed/ switched out. 3) The exit load applicability was reviewed to ensure that the units being redeemed are free from exit load, to ensure minimum leakage from the investment returns. 4) The redemptions were also planned from different investment portfolios like self, wife, and children to ensure that the tax incidence due to long term capital gains is minimal.

As such, one may need to dilute a larger chunk of investments to realize that goal or stay Need-based withdrawal, not market-based: This is another important aspect of prudent financial planning. If the markets are doing well, one is often enticed to continue to stay invested to ride the future market rallies. However, it is always better to limit the redemptions as per the specific needs, instead of being based on the market trends.

Further, the discussions were also aimed to gauge the risk beating ability of Dr Thiagrajan, to design an investment portfolio best suiting his risk profile and financial goals. It was also necessary to discuss and align the return expectations to ensure a pleasant investment experience for Dr Thiagrajan, who did not have an earlier experience of investing in mutual funds.

Considering the financial goals and the investment horizon, a suitable investment plan was formulated with monthly Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) for each of his specific goals after considering the available investment surplus. Investment in equity schemes was suggested to be done in a staggered manner either through SIP or Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) to average out the impact of market volatility. While Dr Thiagrajan had a pleasant investment experience for the initial months, he experienced the market volatility in its real sense post demonetisation. Markets corrected significantly after the demonetisation of high- denomination notes was announced by the prime minister in November 2016, which resulted in all the existing profits getting vanished. However, Dr Thiagarajan continued to invest in the volatile markets as per the investment plan advised by his financial advisor, as he understood that while the current portfolio valuation may not be high, the same will grow once the market recovers.

You can't go bankrupt if you don't have any loans 3. Incrementally take up your equity exposure in your asset allocation. Use down days to invest or a simple periodic investment plan I would like to leave with you one long-range thinking exercise - if India's nominal GDP compounds at 9 per cent per annum in dollar terms from FY22 to FY30, what will our GDP by then? Where will India globally rank? TThe author is the Associate Director and Fund Manager, PMS, Motilal Oswal AMCEquities work with a higher degree of certainty only in the long term. The most important reason to invest in equities is the fact it earns compounding returns. For example, 15 per cent compounded for five years is 2x, 10 years is 4x, 20 years is 16x. So longer the horizon, the more the return! In times like now, the haze is so heavy that even simple math of compounding gets difficult to see. Never turn off this beacon of light. For example, you invested ` 100. > up 25 per cent and down > 40 per cent; suddenly the lights go off. Darkness blinds us. While in the dark, the important aspect is how we feel a lack of control and perceive that things are going to get worse. While its natural to think so, it is also important not to brood over the decision that you took when it was up 30 per cent. It does not matter now. It is a lesson to be learnt but not an action to be fretted upon. What has always helped me to navigate the dark is to have a proper framework. Frameworks can be developed through extensive reading, listening to people and thinking, like net practise in cricket. Think of it like playing against Shane Warne without the technical knowledge of leg-spin. You do not know what the next ball is going to be (dark) but if you don't know how to play, it doesn't really matter (framework). It is still possible that you get out, but the probability of hitting a century increases manifold if you practice in the nets. Now, how to go about navigating in the dark? Well, so, you are now left with ` 75 (as illustrated earlier) and disillusioned with the market and its participants. The simplest decision is to take money off the table and walk away. But as they say, the easiest normally is not right. So, what should one do?

I grew up in a household where money management and equity were discussed daily. Like a sponge, I was soaking up the finer points. I grew up in humble surroundings. My grandmother and mother had to sell all their jewellery for my father's brokerage license. My mother would double up as his typewriter. Nine of us lived in a small two-bedroom apartment in Mumbai. We were extremely conservative and judicious with our money. My father has been my biggest inspiration and role model. Most of my lessons about money and investment have come from him. The way he led us was something I always looked up to. He believed that one's outlook towards money had to be the same regardless if one won a lottery or earned it through hard work. If you are conservative with your money in your professional life, you cannot be spending lavishly in your personal life. Simply put, if you do not respect money, it will not respect you. This consistent attitude often leads to better decision-making and helps one avoid big money mistakes. The year 1992-93 was important for us as a family and for our business. It laid the foundation of our value system and investment philosophy, in addition to providing us with confidence and self-belief. Although I was just a kid, it would take me more than two decades to realise how this impacted my behavior towards money. This was the era of Harshad Mehta securities scam. My father was trying to establish himself as a broker who did things the right way. However, a lot of his contemporaries were getting rich in no time. He even got offers to join them but he refused. He held on to his beliefs that he would be rewarded in due time. It showed us that managing people's money as well as our own required a huge degree of integrity, honesty and responsibility, no matter how unpopular it was in the short-term. Since then, there was no looking back. I lived through subsequent market cycles. Every cycle made me more resilient and confident in managing my own finances and making rational decisions. In 2015, my father suddenly passed away in a car accident. I was made responsible to manage our family finances as well as the future of our organisation. I had the good fortune to learn some important money lessons that I put into practice. Patience is crucial when it comes to investments. Having a plan and following an investment philosophy is key to long-term success. The key to achieving financial independence is to be debt-free. I am fortunate my family started investing on my behalf since I was six years old. By the time I went for my higher education and got married, I did not have to take any loan. Being debt-free, allows the investments to compound uninterrupted. I regularly invest my savings, which helps further in growing the corpus. I have started investing for my daughter since she was six months old. I hope this will help her follow her dreams and passion, without being bogged down by debt. This will be my biggest joy and gift to her. My investments are predominantly in equity, about 80 to 90 per cent, the rest are in liquid funds to take care of emergency or unexpected expenses. This asset allocation works for me, as I believe equity is the best asset class for wealth creation and I am not perturbed by the volatility that is associated with it. I am young enough to take on the risk associated with equity at this time. My wife is a director in a multinational bank. Her hard work and dedication have always inspired me to do better. My daughter could not ask for a better role model. My wife is more than capable of managing her own finances after being in banking for 15 years. Her asset allocation is quite different. Real estate, gold and equity make up for her basket of investments. Managing money separately helps us complete our asset allocation as a family, yet aids in reaching our financial goals.
