Silica or silicon is rarely talked about as an essential mineral for supplementation, but many scientists believe that is exactly what this main ingredient in sand truly is. There is some disagreement about whether we need silicon dioxide or not, but the evidence is piling up more and more in favor of it. It is one mineral that needs to be studied much more thoroughly, but there's still plenty of research hinting at health benefits just beneath the surface. No matter what, it's one mineral that can't be completely ignored. 9 Silica Benefits Everyone Should Know Some of the most important silica health benefits you should know about are: 1. Promotes Hair, Skin, and Nail Health Silica has long been a go-to supplement for hair, skin, and nails. Silica is naturally found in nails, making them strong. When our dietary silica goes down, the deficiency causes our nails to grow slower and become more brittle. The same goes for hair. Silica also plays a role in keeping skin elastic and collagen healthy. 2. Improves Joint Health Since collagen is vital to healthy joints, connective tissue or ligaments, and cartilage, silica is important too. It lends strength and elasticity to collagen, so joints are more flexible, heal quicker, and can snap back from the daily wear and tear our bodies undergo with all our bending, twisting, and stretching. Many people also use silica to help [ease joint pain](https://sunwarrior.com/blogs/health-hub/reduce-pain-inflammation-with-cbd-oil?utm_medium=sw&utm_source=link&utm_campaign=silica-health-benefits-detox-skin-health) and arthritis symptoms. 3. Boosts Bone Health There are many studies that show the presence of silica helps the body use calcium. As we get older, our silica levels decline, and our bones weaken. There is plenty of evidence that [silica is vital to bone health](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2658806/) and preventing fractures as we age. Teeth and gums get a boost from silica, too. 4. Enhances Heart Health Silica is more prevalent in healthy hearts than diseased hearts. Since silica strengthens the blood vessels and muscle tissue, this shouldn't be too surprising. It also aids the body in the calcification of bones and thus prevents the calcification of other tissues. There is some evidence that silica may help offset the calcification of arterial plaque. It may also play a role in the electrochemical transmissions of the nervous system. 5. Reduces Digestive Disorders Silica is important in building a strong stomach and digestive tract muscles and tissues. Silica assists in rebuilding and fortifying these tissues after they have been damaged by poor diet, parasites, age, or other injuries. 6. Boosts the Immune System Since silica is a vital part of healthy skin and digestive tissue, it is also important in preventing illness and infection. The skin and our digestive system are the first lines of defense we have against pathogens. 7. Hastens the Healing Process As a part of collagen, silica can speed healing of burns, wounds, and scar tissue. 8. Flushes Out Toxins Through Detoxification Silica is very good at removing waste material, toxins, and heavy metals from the body. This makes silica a good addition to any detox program to deeply cleanse your cells. If you want to maximize how silica benefits the digestive tract, make sure you choose healthy food sources. Also, make sure you take vitamin supplements along with your silica supplements. 9. May Help Treat Alzheimer's Disease There is some evidence that aluminum buildup contributes to Alzheimer's, and a recent study showed that silica might play a part in the [removal of aluminum](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22976072). This wasn't the best study and plenty more research still needs to be done, but it is encouraging that silica may help rid ourselves of this pesky metal that is far too prevalent in the environment, beauty products, and foods.

In fact, you might not find yourself eating silica-rich food sources very often. We remove it from most of the foods that contain it and avoid many of the fresh fruits and vegetables that are the richest in it. It is best to get your silica from natural sources. Whole foods rich in fiber are also rich in silica as plants use this mineral for strength and flexibility as well. Cucumber, celery, asparagus, oats, millet, barley, sweet potatoes, leafy greens, beans, leeks, and even strawberries are great sources for silica. So, make sure you start eating these types of foods. Silica supplements are also available. Horsetail and silica powder are the most common, but there are also liquid minerals where you can get much more than just one major mineral. Keep in mind that while silica is an important mineral, we also need magnesium, calcium, iron, manganese, potassium, phosphorus, copper, and many more. The Best Silica Product Available If you're looking for the best silica product on the market, choose [Liquid Light](https://sunwarrior.com/collections/all/products/us-liquid-light-946-4-ml-32-fl-oz-bottle?utm_medium=sw&utm_source=link&utm_campaign=silica-health-benefits-detox-skin-health)!

They're an affordable staple and are very easy to cook, so you won't have trouble including these in your diet. 2. Nuts Cut back on your fatty, sodium-filled chips and fries and switch to healthy nuts! Apart from silica, they're also rich in fiber, protein, and healthy fats. The healthy fats can give you [an energy boost](https://sunwarrior.com/blogs/health-hub/how-to-get-the-most-energy-from-food?utm_medium=sw&utm_source=link&utm_campaign=silica-health-benefits-detox-skin-health).
