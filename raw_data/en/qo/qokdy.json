A sample of university students (n = 51) in Spain were randomly assigned to a seven-week mindfulness treatment or a waiting list control group. Results showed that compared to the control group, individuals in the mindfulness group demonstrated significant improvements across all outcome measures including healthy eating habits (balanced diet, intake rate, snacking between meals, decrease in consumption by negative emotional states, increased consumption by negative emotional states, amount of consumption, meal times, consumption of low-fat products), tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis consumption, and resting habits. There were differences between males and females in some of these variables and a better effect of the treatment was evident in the females of the experimental group when compared to the males. The flow meditation program shows promise for fostering a healthy lifestyle, thus decreasing behaviors related to maladaptive eating, tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis consumption as well as negative rest habits in university students. This mindfulness program could significantly contribute to the treatment of eating disorders and addictions, wherein negative emotional states and impulsivity are central features of the condition.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-08-14", "cleaned_text": "Promoting a Healthy Lifestyle through Mindfulness in University Students: A Randomized Controlled Trial [https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12082450](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12082450) [Eating Habits and Lifestyle changes of the past few decades have increasingly led to changes in eating habits such as the reduced consumption of fresh or minimally processed foods and increased consumption of ultra-processed products [ [2](#B2-nutrients-12-02450)]. New eating habits are reflected in an unhealthy diet and various health-related problems including being overweight [ [1](#B1-nutrients-12-02450), [3](#B3-nutrients-12-02450)]. [4](#B4-nutrients-12-02450)]. For instance, acute adverse health effects following cannabis use were reported by 40% of the participants in a study conducted by Contreras et al. [ [5](#B5-nutrients-12-02450)]. According to this study the most common effects were paranoia, increased heart rate, panic attacks, or anxiety, whereas fewer reported experiencing more severe effects like hallucinations or loss of consciousness. [6](#B6-nutrients-12-02450)]. Thus, youths scoring high in externalizing are more likely to initiate cigarette smoking. In this sense, controlling external variables should be a higher priority. Similarly, alcohol consumption is subject to social and environmental factors (e.g., peer pressure) as well as cognitive factors (e.g., impulsivity, positive expectations and sensation seeking, anxiety sensitivity, and hopelessness), among others [ [7](#B7-nutrients-12-02450), [8](#B8-nutrients-12-02450)]. In addition, alcohol consumption among university students is related to the appearance of problematic behaviors and violence as well as decreased academic performance. [9](#B9-nutrients-12-02450)]. Moreover, several studies have shown that sleeping problems including bad rest habits, correlate positively with both uncontrolled and emotional eating and substance use in differing populations [ [4](#B4-nutrients-12-02450), [10](#B10-nutrients-12-02450), [11](#B11-nutrients-12-02450), [12](#B12-nutrients-12-02450)]. In contrast, sleep duration and sleep quality have been associated with healthy diets [ [2](#B2-nutrients-12-02450)]. [7](#B7-nutrients-12-02450), [10](#B10-nutrients-12-02450), [12](#B12-nutrients-12-02450)]. The modification of these unhealthy behaviors is a potential target for intervention as well as for improving school success. Recommended treatments are psychological and behavioral counselling, different multimodal therapeutic programs, psychotropic medication, and stress management techniques including mindfulness [ [12](#B12-nutrients-12-02450), [13](#B13-nutrients-12-02450), [14](#B14-nutrients-12-02450)]. Likewise, positive personal and family-domestic habits such as looking for calm and tranquil sensations and eating as a family with the TV turned off are related to the capacity of controlling repetitive patterns of thoughts and behaviors, and improved well-being and academic performance [ [15](#B15-nutrients-12-02450)]. 1.1. Mindfulness-Based Meditation [7](#B7-nutrients-12-02450), [14](#B14-nutrients-12-02450), [16](#B16-nutrients-12-02450)] wherein anxiety and impulsivity are key features [ [17](#B17-nutrients-12-02450)]. The value of these strategies has been widely recognized for a wide variety of psychological and psychosomatic disorders associated with emotional dysregulation [ [18](#B18-nutrients-12-02450), [19](#B19-nutrients-12-02450)]. More specifically, different mindfulness-based approaches have been used Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT, [ [20](#B20-nutrients-12-02450), [21](#B21-nutrients-12-02450), [22](#B22-nutrients-12-02450), [23](#B23-nutrients-12-02450)]), Acceptance Commitment Stress Reduction (MBSR, [ [25](#B25-nutrients-12-02450)]); Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy [26](#B26-nutrients-12-02450)]), Eating program (MB-EAT, Kristeller & Wolever, 2014, [ [16](#B16-nutrients-12-02450), [27](#B27-nutrients-12-02450)]). Mindfulness training should target specific behavioral impulses that an individual has difficulty controlling and also provide psycho-education. Attitudes regarding healthy eating and unhealthy behaviors are a key part of most psychological models that aim to foster positive habits. [25](#B25-nutrients-12-02450)], mindfulness is to pay attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally. Furthermore, mindfulness meditation implies observing the thoughts and emotional reactions that occur at each moment by distancing from them (decentering) and not reacting before their presence in the automatic usual way thus, breaking the thinking-feeling-acting typical pattern [ [26](#B26-nutrients-12-02450)]. 1.2. The Present Study [28](#B28-nutrients-12-02450)]. In fact, at least half of this population exhibits inadequate health behaviors that include poor eating and sleeping habits as well as alcohol and substance abuse [ [1](#B1-nutrients-12-02450)]. Despite the large number of studies relating to the variables dealt with in this article, there is a shortage of studies in unhealthy behaviors carried out amongst university students, most of them being about eating habits and alcohol consumption, and there have been no previous studies analyzing them all simultaneously. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of the first studies to specifically investigate the effects of mindfulness on a wide range of variables related to healthy lifestyle in university students. This is an important issue given the existing risk that maladaptive behaviors generate negative habits and disorders in later adulthood (e.g., eating disorders, alcoholism, drug addiction). Thus, the current study provides an experimental test of the effects of meditation practice in behaviors related to a healthy lifestyle including healthy eating, substance abuse control, and adequate rest habits. [12](#B12-nutrients-12-02450), [29](#B29-nutrients-12-02450), [30](#B30-nutrients-12-02450), [31](#B31-nutrients-12-02450)]. Given the role of emotional problems and external factors in lifestyle patterns including sleep, food intake, and alcohol and drug use among youths, the goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention program known as flow meditation (Meditaci\u00f3n-Fluir, FM, [ [32](#B32-nutrients-12-02450), [33](#B33-nutrients-12-02450), [34](#B34-nutrients-12-02450), [35](#B35-nutrients-12-02450)]. Specifically, this study evaluated the effects of mindfulness on a range of different life behaviors and variables including eating patterns (i.e., number of meal times, balanced diet, intake rate, consumption of low-fat products, snacking between meals, decrease in consumption due to negative emotional states (NES), and increase in consumption due to NES), tobacco, cannabis, alcohol consumption, and resting habits. Thus, it was hypothesized that compared to a waiting-list control group, students who completed the mindfulness intervention would demonstrate significant improvements in the aforementioned variables. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Participants 2.2. Procedure [32](#B32-nutrients-12-02450)] was administered to the intervention group using two-hour weekly group sessions for a period of seven weeks. The training program included (i) mindfulness exercises from Kabat-Zinns' [ [36](#B36-nutrients-12-02450)] stress-reduction program; (ii) mindfulness techniques used in acceptance and commitment therapy [ [37](#B37-nutrients-12-02450), [38](#B38-nutrients-12-02450), [39](#B39-nutrients-12-02450)]; and (iii) exposure to and debate on metaphors and exercises used in Zen [ [40](#B40-nutrients-12-02450)] and Vipassana meditation [ [41](#B41-nutrients-12-02450)], which promotes values such as acceptance, forgiveness, and non-identification with mental events. Finally, some exercises that could be placed within the framework of logotherapy were also included [ [42](#B42-nutrients-12-02450)], since their objective was to learn to overcome the existential void that arises from the lack of meaning in what we do and in the life we lead, and to take responsibility in this way for our own life. Logotherapy has demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of different problems including addictions, depression, anger, anxiety, and for fostering psychological well-being [ [43](#B43-nutrients-12-02450), [44](#B44-nutrients-12-02450)]. [32](#B32-nutrients-12-02450), [33](#B33-nutrients-12-02450), [34](#B34-nutrients-12-02450), [35](#B35-nutrients-12-02450), [45](#B45-nutrients-12-02450)]. The program includes existential, ethical, and spiritual aspects and values, and thus conforms to Van Gordons\u00b4 criteria for second generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) [ [46](#B46-nutrients-12-02450)]. The program was facilitated by an instructor with extensive experience in both the practice and teaching of mindfulness meditation techniques. [Table 1](#nutrients-12-02450-t001)): - Discussion and feedback on the mindfulness meditation exercises practiced during the previous week. - Ten-minute guided-mindful body-scan. - Presentation of the various metaphors and exercises corresponding to each session. - Practice of mindful breathing for 30 min. 2.3. Ethical Considerations 2.4. Measures [47](#B47-nutrients-12-02450)]. Cronbach's alpha for this questionnaire was 0.79. [48](#B48-nutrients-12-02450)]. This 27-item questionnaire measures the following variables: Externality (eight items: e.g., \"eating when you see advertisements on TV or magazine\"); Decrease in Food Consumption due to NES (five items: e.g., \"eating less or just not eating because you feel nervous\"); Increase in Food Consumption due to NES (five items: e.g., \"eating because you feel bored\"); Quantity Consumption Pattern (four items: e.g., \"filling your plate too much\"); and Intake Rate (three items: e.g., \"eating fast\"), valued on a frequency scale of 1 (\"always\")to 7 (\"never\") points. The items \"Snacking between meals\" (whose frequency has been rated on a 5-point scale, from \"never\" to \"everyday\") and \"Consumption of low-fat meals and/or beverages\" (whose frequency has been rated on a 7-point scale from \"never\" to \"everyday\") are individually analyzed. Cronbach's alpha for this questionnaire was 0.84. 2.5. Data Analyses [49](#B49-nutrients-12-02450)] and is expressed as follows: r = z/N. The results of r were compared by applying the Cohen [ [50](#B50-nutrients-12-02450)] classification, which indicates that between 0.2 and 0.5, the effect size will be small; it will be moderate between 0.5 and 0.8; and above 0.8, it will be large. For this partial Eta square, around 0.01, little effect was considered; a moderate effect around 0.06; and a large effect at 0.14. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 25.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). 3. Results [Table 2](#nutrients-12-02450-t002). [Table 2](#nutrients-12-02450-t002)). In addition, in the experimental group, sizeable effects were obtained on balanced diet and rest habits ( [Figure 1](#nutrients-12-02450-f001)and [Figure 2](#nutrients-12-02450-f002)), whereas moderate effects were observed on alcohol consumption, respect for meal times, externality, decreased consumption due to NES, increased consumption due to NES, and quantity of consumption. 4. Discussion [46](#B46-nutrients-12-02450), [51](#B51-nutrients-12-02450)]) known as flow meditation (FM, Meditaci\u00f3n-Fluir) with a waiting list control group to investigate the effects of mindfulness on different behaviors leading to a healthy lifestyle in a sample of university students. Compared to first-generation mindfulness-based interventions, SG-MBIs employ a slightly different model of mindfulness that emphasizes the importance of non-attachment to self as well as to psychological and somatic symptoms. Results showed that the mindfulness intervention was effective in reducing unhealthy life behaviors, especially for eating (balanced diet, food intake), alcohol consumption, and maladaptive rest habits in a sample of young university students. [9](#B9-nutrients-12-02450), [52](#B52-nutrients-12-02450)]. It has a strong negative impact on family and social engagement and imposes substantial costs including health-care and social services costs [ [53](#B53-nutrients-12-02450)] and non-health-care costs associated with obesity such as job or school absenteeism [ [54](#B54-nutrients-12-02450)], thus increasing the risk of mental disorders and disordered eating development in the future [ [54](#B54-nutrients-12-02450), [55](#B55-nutrients-12-02450)]. Fortunately, mindful eating programs have proven to be effective in improving body image, reducing eating disorder symptomatology, and preventing weight gain [ [16](#B16-nutrients-12-02450), [56](#B56-nutrients-12-02450), [57](#B57-nutrients-12-02450)]. [34](#B34-nutrients-12-02450), [58](#B58-nutrients-12-02450)]. This is a relevant finding since insufficient rest due to bad sleeping habits is related to poor academic performance [ [2](#B2-nutrients-12-02450)]. [45](#B45-nutrients-12-02450), [46](#B46-nutrients-12-02450), [51](#B51-nutrients-12-02450)]. This is consistent with previous studies of flow meditation in which mindfulness was shown to be effective in adolescents with high levels of aggressiveness and lack of impulse control [ [33](#B33-nutrients-12-02450)]. In addition, mindfulness approaches can intervene by improving the regulation of emotions [ [16](#B16-nutrients-12-02450), [29](#B29-nutrients-12-02450)] and increasing the experience of positive emotional states [ [19](#B19-nutrients-12-02450), [59](#B59-nutrients-12-02450)]. [17](#B17-nutrients-12-02450), [19](#B19-nutrients-12-02450)]. An additional mechanism of action would be through attitude change [ [52](#B52-nutrients-12-02450)]. In this sense, over the past decade, the practice of mindfulness has increasingly been linked to sustainable consumption behaviors [ [52](#B52-nutrients-12-02450), [60](#B60-nutrients-12-02450)]. Schools, universities, and community public health practitioners should provide prevention and intervention efforts among the target population [ [61](#B61-nutrients-12-02450)]. Given their increasing prevalence of maladaptive health habits among this population, and the associated health-related risks and concurrent psychopathology, greater attention is needed to improve the efficacy of existing treatments. University and college arenas represent an important opportunity for health and nutritional education.
