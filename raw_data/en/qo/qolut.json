Hutcheson,2 PhD 1 Veterinary Research and Consulting Services, LLC, Hays, KS 67601 2 Merck Animal Health, Desoto, KS 66018 Corresponding author: Dr. Miles Theurer, milestheurer@gmail.com Abstract Tildipirosin was compared to tulathromycin for treat\u00ad ment of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in feedlot cattle. Six hundred calves identified with BRD by feedlot pen riders with a rectal temperature > 104.0\u00b0F (> 40\u00b0C) and no previous treatments of disease were randomly allocated to treatment with either tildipirosin or tulathromycin in a 1:1 ratio within lot. Eligible lots included 2 different risk categories: 1) calves with low or moderate risk of developing BRD that did not receive a metaphylactic antimicrobial at arrival, or 2) calves determined to be at high risk of developing BRD that were administered a metaphylactic antimicrobial (tilmicosin) at arrival processing. Calves were returned to their home pen immediately after treatment and were monitored for 60 days. All enrolled animals which died during the study were necropsied by a veterinarian or trained feedlot personnel. Data were evaluated with generalized linear mixed models including lot as random effect comparing treatment groups and metaphylaxis status. No differences were observed (P>0.12) in health outcomes between the 2 treatment groups. Also, there were no differences in first treatment success or case fatality rate in calves with differing metaphylaxis status. Tildipirosin and tulathromycin were both effective antimi\u00ad crobials for first treatment of BRD in medium- to low-risk populations of feedlot cattle.

Introduction Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) continues to be the most common and economically significant disease affect\u00ad ing the beef industry.1 0 Costs attributable to BRD include the cost of treatment, increased mortality risk, decreased performance, and loss of carcass value.3 '4 1 1 ,2 1 '2 5 Management strategies, vaccinations, and anti-infective products are used in an attempt to decrease incidence and severity of BRD. The 2011 National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) survey of beef feedlots determined that > 93% of cattle were administered injectable respiratory vaccines, while antim icrobial metaphylaxis was administered to 21.3% of the cattle placed in the feedlot.2 7 Both of these risk 154 THE BOVINE PRACTITIONER-VOL. 52, NO. 2\u00a9 Copyright American Association of Bovine Practitioners; open access distribution. mitigation practices have previously been shown to reduce incidence of BRD; however, BRD still occurs despite these practices.2 0 - 2 3 '2 6 '2 8 In the same NAHMS survey, 16.2% of feedlot cattle were diagnosed with clinical BRD.1 5 ' 2 2 '2 7 Cattle with BRD are commonly administered antimicrobial therapy. Several factors are used when selecting from antimicrobial options for treatment of BRD, including but not limited to efficacy, price, duration of action, and withdrawal period. Tildipirosin has been evaluated for treatment of BRD.916 Also, mixed treatment comparison meta-analyses have been performed evaluating tildipirosin against other commer\u00ad cially available antimicrobials for treatment of BRD181 9 and metaphylaxis control of BRD.1 These meta-analyses were performed with no direct comparisons of tildipirosin to other antimicrobials. Although indirect comparisons pro\u00ad vide reasonable estimates, additional research is needed to determine treatment efficacy of tildipirosin in naturally occurring BRD cases compared to tulathromycin. Dodd et al reported improved first-treatment success, reduced BRD mortality, and reduced total mortality in calves treated with tulathromycin compared to tildipirosin in heifer calves with a high incidence of acute respiratory morbidity.6 This popu\u00ad lation of calves experienced 75.9% respiratory morbidity in the first 10 days-on-feed (DOF), and represents only a small percentage of cattle on feed in typical commercial feedlots. The primary objective of this study was to compare treatment efficacy of tildipirosin to tulathromycin for first treatment of BRD and any association to subsequent health outcomes in a commercial feedlot placing calves at low to moderate risk of developing BRD. A secondary objective of the study was to compare health outcomes in calves initially treated for BRD > 21 DOF that received metaphylactic tilmicosin at ar\u00ad rival processing compared to calves which did not receive a metaphylactic antimicrobial during arrival processing. Materials and Methods The study was performed at a commercial feedlot facil\u00ad ity located near Montezuma, Kansas. The study began Novem\u00ad ber 3,2017 and concluded May 15,2018. All procedures were approved by the Merck Animal Health Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee prior to study initiation. Sample size Bovine respiratory disease case fatality rate7 was considered the primary outcome for this study and used to determine sample size estimates. Sample size was based on the ability to identify a difference of 7 percentage points with a baseline of 7%. Alpha was set at 0.05, and beta set to 0.20 using a commercial software package,3 resulting in 300 calves per treatment group. Animal enrollment Calves were observed daily by pen riders for identifi\u00ad cation of BRD based upon subjective evaluation includingphysical appearance, attitude, gauntness, nasal discharge, and reluctance to move. Calves were removed from the home pen and moved to a hospital for confirmatory diagnosis and either enrollment into or exclusion from the study. All calves identified by pen riders as having clinical signs of BRD were evaluated by a veterinarian (MET) prior to enrollment. Inclusion criteria for the study were rectal temperature > 104.0\u00b0F (> 40\u00b0C), no previous treatments for disease, estimated > 60 days to harvest, and absence of clinical signs of disease in other organ systems. Eligible lots either did not receive a metaphylactic antimicrobial or did receive a metaphylactic antimicrobial at arrival whether or not to metaphylactically treat individual lots at arrival processing was made by feedyard personnel based upon subjective risk classification of the cattle at arrival into the feedlot. All lots of cattle in the feedlot were eligible to be enrolled based upon meeting the metaphylaxis processing inclusion criteria. Calves in lots that received a metaphylactic antibiotic were not eligible for inclusion in the study until > 21 DOF. Once calves were enrolled from an individual lot, all first BRD treatments which met the inclusion criteria were enrolled into the study. There was a tentative eligible population of 56,178 calves at the time of this study, based upon lot inclusion criteria and enrollment period. Calves meeting inclusion criteria were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups within each lot: tildip\u00ad in left neck) by different personnel (MET) than pen riders. An enrollment form was created to assign calves to treatment group in pairs within a lot; random numbers were assigned to each blank. The low\u00ad est random number within a pair was assigned to TILcand the highest random number was assigned to TULd within each pair. The first calf which met the case definition was assigned to the treatment group assigned to the first blank on the enrollment form. The next calf from the same lot which met the case definition was assigned to the second blank on the enrollment form. Calves were randomized to have treat\u00ad ments evenly distributed within lot; duplicate ear tags were used to identify each calf. Individual body weight and rectal temperature were collected for all calves enrolled, and were recorded in a feedlot animal health computer system.6 Calves treated for BRD were returned to their home pen. Calves were monitored for 60 days to determine subsequent health outcomes by feedlot personnel blinded to the experimental treatment. BRD retreatm ents A 5-day post-treatment interval (PTI) was used for both the TIL and TUL treatment groups. Calves were eligible for retreatment if identified with clinical signs of BRD by pen riders, had a rectal temperature of > 104.0\u00b0F (> 40\u00b0C) SUMMER 2018 155 and/or lost body weight from first treatment, and met or exceeded the PTI. All pen riders were blinded to treatment group. Calves requiring a second treatment for BRD were administered PTI was used after the second treatment, and calves requiring a third treatment for BRD were administered A gross necropsy was performed by a veterinarian or trained feedlot personnel on all enrolled animals which died during the study. A cause of death was determined for all calves that died during the monitoring period. Feed, housing, and w ater Calves were fed diets formulated to meet or exceed National Research Council maintenance requirements. Ra\u00ad tions consisted of steam flaked corn, wet distillers' grains, ground alfalfa hay, chopped corn stalks, supplement, and ground prairie hay. No feed-grade antimicrobials labeled for control of BRD were fed to calves during the study. Calves were housed in dirt floor pens consistent with commercial feedlot operations. Water was provided ad libitum through an automatic float-activated system. Data m anagem ent Data from all calves which died due to causes other than BRD, or required additional treatments not related to BRD, were removed prior to analysis. Binary variables were created for treatment successes and case fatality rate health outcomes. Treatment success was defined as not requiring additional treatment for BRD, and surviving the 60-day monitoring period. Case fatality rate was defined as the per\u00ad centage of calves treated that died of BRD during the 60-day monitoring period. Treatment death interval was calculated from days of first treatment for BRD to the day of death for calves that died of BRD. Statistical analyses Data were imported into a commercial software package.3 Continuous outcomes (enrollment body weight, enrollment rectal temperature, body weight at second treat\u00ad ment, rectal temperature at second treatment, body weight at third treatment, rectal temperature at third treatment, and treatment death interval] were evaluated with linear mixed models. Binary outcomes (treatment successes and case fatality rate] were evaluated using generalized linear mixed models. All models included a fixed effect of treatment group and random effect of origin lot. Differences exhibiting a P value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Health outcomes were evaluated using a generalized linear mixed model where treatment, metaphylaxis status, and treatment by metaphylaxis status were used as fixed effects, and lot of origin was used as a random effect.Results A total of 600 calves were enrolled into the study (TIL n = 299; TULn = 301]. Seven calves were removed prior to analysis due to conditions not directly associated with BRD (TIL n = 4; TUL n = 3]. Two calves with digestive disorders and 2 with heart failure were removed from the TIL group. One calf in the TUL group died of thromboembolic meningo\u00ad encephalitis, 1 died of atypical interstitial pneumonia, and 1 calf sustained a shoulder injury during reimplant. These calf removals occurred prior to the end of the 60-day monitor\u00ad ing period, leaving 295 head in the TIL group for analysis, and 298 head in the TUL group. A total 430 calves were not administered a metaphylactic antibiotic at arrival, and 163 calves were administered tilmicosin during arrival processing and were enrolled with >21 DOF. No differences in treatment success or case fatality rate were identified between the 2 treatment groups (Table 1]. The statistical models evaluating body weight, rectal tem\u00ad perature, and treatment success at third treatment would not converge when constructed as described above, therefore the random effect for origin lot was removed from these models. There were no significant interactions between treat\u00ad ment group and metaphylaxis status for all health outcomes (P>0.10; Table 2]. Rectal temperature (P=0.02] at enrollment and rectal temperature at third treatment for BRD (P=0.02] were greater in calves not administered tilmicosin upon ar\u00ad rival processing compared to calves treated metaphylactically with tilmicosin at arrival processing (Table 3]. No other dif\u00ad ferences in health outcomes were identified in the evaluation of metaphylaxis status. Discussion Results from this study indicate there were no differ\u00ad ences in health outcomes in calves treated with tildipirosin compared to tulathromycin for first treatment of BRD. Judi\u00ad cious use of antimicrobials requires studies to follow cattle and evaluate treatment efficacies.5 To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to compare health outcomes for cattle which were metaphylactically administered tilmicosin on ar\u00ad rival and treated for BRD >21 DOF compared to calves which were not metaphylactically treated during arrival processing. Results of the current study differ from a previous study comparing tildipirosin and tulathromycin for BRD treatment.6 However, this may be explained by the referent populations used in each study. Dodd et al enrolled 75.9% of a high-risk contiguous arrival group over a 10-day period,6 and the current study enrolled calves over a 133-day period from a feedlot population at low- to moderate-risk for developing BRD. Calves enrolled in the study by Dodd et al would likely be administered antimicrobials during arrival processing to reduce BRD in most commercial feedlot settings.1 4 The aver\u00ad age BRD incidence is 16.2%, and the frequency of lots with greater than 75% BRD morbidity is small.2 4 ,2 7 The referent 156 THE BOVINE PRACTITIONER\u2014VOL. 52, NO. 2 Table 1.

Interestingly, there were no observed differences in health outcomes among calves not administered metaphylax\u00ad is upon arrival compared to calves which were administered tilmicosin metaphylaxis and subsequently pulled for BRD >21 DOF. Additionally, there were no significant (P>0.05) in\u00ad teractions between treatment group and metaphylaxis status. Metaphylaxis has been shown to shift the nasopharyngeal microbiota and antimicrobial susceptibility profile of BRD pathogens.1 3 ,2 9 Additionally, nasopharyngeal microbiota and the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of BRD pathogens have been shown to change within the first 2 DOF1 2 and between feedlot arrival and 90 DOF.8 Additional work is needed to establish any association to clinically relevant outcomes, such as treatment failures, chronic animals, and mortality, and the results of in vitro antibiograms. One limitation of this study was that calves were only monitored for 60 days post-enrollment, and no performance outcomes were collected. Sample size was determined based upon a large case fatality rate difference between treatment groups; however, clinically there appears to be minimal differ\u00ad ences between treatment groups in the medium- to low-risk population of cattle evaluated. The power for identifying a difference in outcomes by metaphylaxis status was less than treatment comparison; however, these results provide initial results for further studies. Additional research is needed to evaluate treatment efficacies using antimicrobials that are in the same class as those used in a metaphylactic program.Conclusions No health differences were identified in calves treated with tildipirosin compared to tulathromycin for first treat\u00ad ment of BRD or between calves receiving a metaphylactic antibiotic compared to calves that did not. Tildipirosin and tulathromycin were effective antimicrobials for first treat\u00ad ment of BRD in the medium- to low-risk populations of cattle.
