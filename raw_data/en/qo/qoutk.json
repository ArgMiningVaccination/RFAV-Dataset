Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a serious disease. Infected children have spells of violent coughing that can cause them to vomit or stop breathing for a short period. The cough can last for weeks and make it hard for a child to eat, drink or even breathe. Adults can also contract whooping cough. Are there complications linked to whooping cough? Pneumonia can occur in more than two out of 10 children with whooping cough, and in rare cases, the disease can cause brain damage and death. Severe complications happen most often in babies. How is whooping cough spread? Pertussis spreads easily from infected person to others through coughing or sneezing. What is a combination vaccine? Children routinely receive four or five vaccines in one needle. The new whooping cough vaccine is included in these new combination vaccines. They protect children against pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus, polio and Hemophilus type B (Hib). They are recommended for use in infants and children younger than seven years. Children receive single injections at two, four, six and 18 months of age. A booster shot is also given between the ages of four and six. This fifth dose not include Hib vaccine. How does the new combination vaccine protect children? When given in the recommended number of shots, the vaccines protect 85 per cent of children against whooping cough, more than 85 per cent against diphtheria, more than 95 per cent against tetanus, 99 per cent against polio and about 90 per cent against serious Hib infections. Vaccination also makes these diseases milder for children who catch them. Is the new whooping cough vaccine safe? The new vaccine is the safest pertussis vaccine available today. This newer acellular vaccine causes even fewer minor reactions and the chances of more serious complications following this vaccine remain extremely rare.
