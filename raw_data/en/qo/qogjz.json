After escaping, Dundee and Benji have a friendly conversation using knives and guns with Yuno, lecturing him on his naivety, his big mouth, and his fabulous glow-in-the-dark-but-definitely-unfit-for-robbery neon green shoes. Dundee steals Yuno's money (he later returns it) and Benji takes Yuno's fancy shoes and drives off to sell the stolen goods, leaving Dundee and Yuno behind. Yuno sadly breaks his lockpick and instead goes with Dundee to rendezvous with Benji, who gives the $1100 earnings to Yuno and Dundee.

Accepting to work with just about anyone right as the cops start becoming more aggressive towards bank robbers, Yuno finds himself in a variety of odd and concerning situations: from unplanned shoot-outs and busted plans to sneaky news reporters and obsessed Park Rangers. However, Yuno never cares too much as he is always trying to just have fun, finding amusement in encouraging more and more people to join the criminal ranks and even coaching some new hackers in their endeavors.| Through his many heists, Yuno becomes closer to | | Part 4: The Heist of the Decade[ ] |With a new objective in mind, Yuno and his new crew start working towards gathering the resources they'll need to hit the Vault, while also keeping up with their every day sheananigans.

Mr Lang is able to easily shake off the cops by driving through the mounting side, and then losing the helicopter in the city. A step closer to Yuno's dream of getting a car, he readily agrees to go for a second heist with Raymond just after dropping his newly acquired money bags. With the tsunami drawing closer they enlist The group eventually leaves the bank with their loot, splitting up with Yuno and Raymond in one bike and Mr K and Mickey in the other. After an unfortunate crash, Raymond shows off his bike driving skills and manages to lose the cops after a crazy drive around the city. The duo heads to the apartments to get changed (and for Raymond to stash the loot away), but as soon as Yuno walks outside of the apartments he gets detained by a police officer that overheard After all is said and done he regroups with the heist crew to inform them someone might have snitched and to split up the loot, vowing to be more mindful of who he shares his illegal plans with. He later calls Tulip to check back on her, she immediately accusing him of kidnapping her and revealing she's the one that mentioned his name to the cops. Yuno convinces her he has just woken up, gas-lighting her into thinking someone else kidnapped her, telling her she can not go accusing people based on their voice alone. Feeling sorry for framing an innocent man she agrees to meet him at the casino, eventually heading to the rooftop to talk in private. There Yuno explains she should not go snitching on people as it is something the criminals of Los Santos unanimously frown upon, telling her she could be targeted if it became public knowledge. When she argues the cops would probably protect her Yuno dismisses the idea, saying the cops have robbed him of more money than any criminal ever has. All while they were talking Yuno leads Tulip to the edge of the rooftop, picking her up and threatening on throwing her off the roof as payback for her snitching, claiming it could have cost him $25K if the charges stuck, and knowing Tulip doesn't have that sort of money that's the only way she can pay him back. After her pleas he agrees to not throw her off of the building, saying the only way he would forgive her is if she jumps herself. Yuno however slips while giving her his speech, falling of the building himself only to be followed by Tulip seconds after. Thankfully the tsunami comes not a second later, washing away their injuries. |Closer to his goal of buying a new car Yuno decides to start the day by doing some oxy runs to clean the money he got from his previous heist,.

However, not a second after she is done he flees the event, hiding away at the He heads back to the apartments to meet with Lenny hoping they can get a dongle from robbing some houses, where Lenny gives him the cash for the money he cleaned for him earlier that morning. As Yuno heads to the bank to deposit it he receives a call from Yuno calls Mr Lang to inform him of the Paleto situation and ask for his opinion, with Mr Lang initially thinking that Yuno would ditch him to go and rob the bank with Leah's group. To Mr Lang's surprise Yuno tells him he is willing to wind the other group up and stall them long enough for Mr Lang's group to do the heist and get their hands on a red dongle. Knowing Yuno's work in building up the criminal scene of Los Santos by helping \"fresh\" criminals like Leah and Jay, Mr Lang tells Yuno they can postpone their own heist to give the newcomers the chance to get their feet wet. With that out of the way Yuno and Lenny get on their way to sign up for houses and pick up some tea and ramen from the After solo robbing some houses (since Lenny had to head back to bed after a terrible headache), he drives to the fence to sell some of his stolen goods, while catching up on the phone with his twin he learns that After learning Raymond will be the fourth member of the Paleto crew, Yuno meets with them to start setting everything up for their escape. Knowing the cops are becoming savy of their escape planes, they will have Yuno and Leah at the bank, with Jay waiting for them at the Alamo sea, where he will pick them up after they drive the car into the water. Meanwhile Raymond will be guarding a couple of mountain bikes, making sure the cops do not find them before time and preparing to call Yuno to give him a heads up should that be the case so that he and Leah can instead go pick up some of the bikes they stashed away in the city as a backup plan. With the preparations almost out of the way, Yuno heads back to the city to get changed and give Leah enough time to pick the laptop. As he is driving back he notices a tweet from the GSF's leader, The plan runs without a hitch, with the group splitting in two directions with Leah (holding the bags) and Jay in one bike and Raymond and Yuno (holding the red dongle) in the other. Leah and Jay are able to go unhindered, as the cars and helicopter seem to be set on Ray and Yuno. Ray drives the bike through the mountains to lose the cops, but the duo are surprised to see that a cruiser (presumably driven by Outside the apartments he runs into |Starting the new day, Yuno promptly receives a call from | Arranging to hit a bank later on with Leaving his friends in order to attend his race, Yuno is discouraged when he sees the amazing racing cars everyone is arriving in, then even more discouraged when Despite the fact that he's on a four-door sedan, and the fact that he got repeatedly pitted and rammed on by officer Ending up in last place from the get-go, Yuno feels demoralized as he tries his absolute best to at least finish the race, crashing with other cars non stop and spinning out a few times due to the fog. To make things worse, a police cruiser catches him right as he's about to finish the race, for which he tries to make a run for it and ends up getting pitted non-stop until he finally gives up. With Hitting up some grocery and clothing stores for quick money, Yuno receives an opportune call from Raymond, who has acquired a green dongle and wants to bring Yuno on the job. Narrating his horrible day, the hacker quickly accepts the offer and meets up with his friend on a stolen Akuma (their favorite bike), rushing to the apartments to meet up with the rest of the squad: Randy and Curtis. Receiving an opportune call from Harry Park, Randy and Yuno meet with the car-salesman who returns Yuno's impounded car and even gets it fixed for him, leaving Randy impressed with Yuno's connections. Storing away his Sultan, they start planning the getaway for their Fleeca, the idea being that they'll drive into a subway station and change into motorcycles. Sensing Raymond's lust for blood, Yuno reluctantly agrees that if it comes down to it, he'll shoot some cops. Passing by the Rushing to the pick-up site for the laptop and finding a hostage right outside the bank they're robbing, the crew goes inside and quickly does the normal procedure, with Yuno one-shot hacking the bank as usual. Sharing friendly banter with the negotiator and complaining about their busted car, the team promptly leave the premises and easily lose five police cruisers (because they crashed into each other). With only one cruiser on them, Randy tries some maneuvers to lose him and accidentally runs over a motorcycle on the floor which explodes. With the car stalled, the quartet scrambles to escape. Ray and Curtis go in one direction, Randy and Yuno run around to the casino and lose track of officer Changing clothes, the pair run to the station where they'd hidden their motorcycles trying to find the others, discovering soon that Curtis was arrested and Randy was shot by the police. Getting caught in the process of scouting down the area, Yuno manages to talk his way out of getting arrested by refusing to repeat the phrases he used during the heist to make harder for the officers to ID him by his voice. Meeting up with Randy (who avoided prison by threatening the entire police force), Yuno is taken by his friend to buy a spoiler for his car (paid for entirely by Randy). Together, they decide to revive the racing scene and plan on inviting someone slower than Yuno so that he can actually win next time. Sharing more information about racing and GNE, Yuno stands up for Randy when someone disrespects him, punching the man and accidentally causing a huge fight between just about everyone right as tsunami hits the town. |After the disastrous results from the races Yuno is hard pressed for money, so he goes on a string of store robberies to get some money on him while waiting for the Vault crew. While going around his business Yuno hears concerning murmurs around the city, while at the | Yuno starts suspecting he might be infected, so he does the sensible thing, infect as many people as possible. After hugging and coughing on his fellow employees, Yuno leaves the Rooster's, trying to find new victims. In a bout of inspiration he calls He then calls on Aimlessly roaming around the city for a bit as Yuno explains what's happening, the group ends up freaking out as they all start seeing and hearing horrible things: creepy sounds, baby screams, zombies rushing towards them and gunshots hitting their bodies despite not being able to feel them at all. Panicked, they reach a water park of some kind and hide in a pool, hoping that the zombies and gunshots won't get to them there. Their hopes dwindle soon enough, for they start passing out in the pool itself and almost drown in more than one occasion. Pinging his location to the confused and worried Raymond, Yuno and his friends soon leave the premises (not before infecting more people) and, as they try to get in the car again, collapse. Randy and his friend manage to get up, whereas Yuno is knocked down and needs to be taken to the hospital. Soon enough, they manage to get to Pillbox in one piece, despite Randy falling asleep behind the wheel more than once, and zombies swarming their vehicle at various points. Relieved to find some doctors in the building (including As he is leaving the hospital, Yuno discovers that Randy has managed to lock himself inside a different hospital wing. Vaguely telling one of the doctors about the issue, and realizing that he's still infected despite his symptoms disappearing, Yuno leaves the building in order to infect more people, casually shoving the blood-stained napkin in Mr Lang praises Yuno, moved by his loyalty and still remembering his unprompted visit to jail when he learned about Mr Lang's imprisonment and pending trial, telling him if he continues trying to save his life he might end up becoming a Cleanboi. Now with the full group they explore the airport, quickly coming up with an ingenious plan where they'll jump into the water and swim to the shore where 2 motorcycles will wait for them; taking the bikes to a hangar, the group will then leave in a plane and make their way to a little island in the middle of the ocean. They also prepare a counter measure in the event that the police learn about their plane, the plan being that after jumping off the bridge, someone will hide under the water with some scuba gear and make their way to a different shoreline where some vehicle awaits for them. With their plan set, the group rents the airplanes and start readying everything up. As Yuno is blocking off the closest entrances to the hangar, however, he starts feeling awful again, his vision going black and his heart aching for no good reason. Realizing that their hacker is in no condition to perform the heist with them, the group decide to postpone the big event for the next day and settle on doing a Paleto heist instead, reassuring the hacker that they won't be hitting the vault without him and letting him go rest. |Recovering from his illness outside of town and having dealt with a personal crisis (including the loss of his internet service), Yuno leaves his apartment with hopes of making some money, encountering | Greeting his coworkers, Yuno is in the middle of preparing some food for himself when he receives a call from Learning that Sharing a sweet hug with Once Yuno recovers, the twins meet up with Raymond and Nino, who show them the plan: driving a four-door from the bank, three members of the group will head towards a construction site where bikes await for them, the fourth member (Nino) waiting eagerly in a truck. As soon as the trio crosses a ramp leading to the main building, Nino, will block it off with a truck to halt the officers. Once they're all through, they'll switch into motorcycles and go separate ways in order to lose the police, with everyone aside from Raymond being a distraction. With the plan set, the twins separate once again in the search for more motorcycles to use, learning in the process that Raymond has gotten run over by a local driver and had to go to the hospital. Practicing their escape, they wait for Raymond and promptly go to the apartments to change. Calling Randy and wishing him luck for his own heist, Yuno changes into his Ramee outfit and they go pick up the laptop. Playfully teasing Raymond's distracted driving and with a lighthearted atmosphere, they pick the laptop and return to the city, where they struggle to find a hostage and even have a run-in with Finally finding a hostage in Realizing that there are no officers coming, Yuno convinces some reporters of calling the police in hopes of at least getting a chase after so many hours of planning. His hopes are crushed once the vault opens, which prompts them to run away with the loot. As they reunite with the sleepy Nino, Yuno receives a call from Guy Jones, who's acquired a green laptop and needs a hacker. With fifteen minutes left before the bank systems reboot for the day, Yuno doesn't even get to practice the plan before they end up in the bank with a hostage. Going on a short bank roadtrip (as most of the Fleeca's have been recently hit), they finally reach their destination and they wait eagerly for With their third member finally arriving, Yuno gets to hacking and one-shots it in record time, confused and worried when several officer cruises and an unidentified helicopter arrive. Worried, Yuno calls Raymond and informs him of the terribly unprepared plan, with his friend telling him that if it comes to it, Yuno can use the plan from earlier. Nervous, they negotiate for the usual demands and leave on their slow car, drive towards the canals right behind the police station, slide through the smallest of cracks between some pillars and jump into another car with Grateful for the hacker's work and having already a spare blue dongle, Guy offers to trade Yuno's cut for the dongle they just got from the heist (despite Philbis' protests), the hacker happily agrees once again reiterating them he will hack for their group any time they need him. Parting at the apartments, he calls Ray and Raymond to inform them of his success learning they are about to start cleaning their dirty money. Driving to the Oxy spot they're headed towards, Yuno waits for them in a little bush and jumps at them so that he can scare them, with Raymond playing along and Ray having none of it, which devolves in a short fist fight between the siblings. As his companions are dealing oxy, Yuno receives a call from Waving him goodbye, Yuno joins Raymond who admonishes Yuno for calling Wingman to their oxy spot since Raymond had kidnapped and tortured the man after the Blocks had kidnapped his girlfriend Done with the Oxy run, Yuno returns to the apartments with his sister and Raymond and parts ways with them. Hearing some shots in the parking lot, the curious Yuno approaches the place of the confrontation and sees Hunter robbing an injured man. When asking what is happening the man immediately says Wingman has just shot him after he tried to defend himself. Hunter does not take kindly to the snitching and bidding Yuno goodbye takes the man on his car to \"give him the Block special\". The man's friend, Rick, tries to stop him, blocking the car's door so that Wingman can not get in the car. Sensing things are about to get bloody, Yuno talks him out of it, seeing Wingman is already on edge. Bored and craving chaos, Yuno introduces himself as \"Bob\" and convinces Rick to go after Hunter, encouraging him to confront the |Starting his day with his daily routine of stealing some free food from the | Briefly discussing the possibility of a Going to the back, Yuno is quickly stopped by X, who informs him that some of his monologue from earlier was fake and that he actually has a lot of dirty money. Offering to do a Paleto with Yuno, the veteran hacker has to settle for doing a solo job as Yuno is going to be busy with the Vault; not too discouraged, X narrates a story about the time he solo-ed Paleto, then tells Yuno that his new plan involves C4, blowing up the Chopper, and killing all the cops. Wishing him luck, Yuno gets back to his responsibilities and tries to get in touch with Tony and Raymond, to no avail. Sneaking out of the Burger Shot and taking a quick trip to the Paleto Farmer's Market to buy some joints, Yuno is suddenly asked by a mysterious lady (who knows him but he doesn't recognize) for hacking tips, wanting to get into it herself. Sharing what little advice he can offer (as most of it relies on practice) and offering to be her back-up hacker if she ever needs it, Yuno is surprised when the woman, Happy with the free weed gummy bears, Yuno calls Lang to notify him that he can't contact the others, then mentions the possibility of having X as a back-up if Tony doesn't arrive. As he is about to hang up, Yuno is mortified to hear that Lang is planning on tossing a molotov at the employees' parking lot at the Burger Shot, for no good reason other than to teach everyone \"respect\". Once he gets over the initial shock, Yuno requests for Lang to wait for him so that Yuno can see and fuel his pyromaniac tendencies. Rushing back to the city and parking in front of the Burger Shot, Yuno finds a tourist bus waiting to take people mountain-biking. Realizing that Cassie is not happy with their presence, Yuno contacts Lang and informs him of the opportunity that's been presented to them, offering to wait with his car by the side so that Lang can throw his molotov and then run to Yuno's car for a quick getaway. As the crazed businessman arrives, Yuno discovers that the actual objective is a little moped bike on the back (allegedly belonging to Quickly stopping by a gun store, Lang purchases a gas can and some ammunition for his gun as he explains that the reason he wants revenge is that earlier he'd purchased 7 murder meals that came with only toys and no food, which severely traumatized the businessman. Perfectly understanding Lang's position and casually talking about their plans for the Vault, Yuno drives to the nearest gas station to fill up the canister and they quickly return to the restaurant. With Cassie witnessing as Lang pours gasoline atop the moped, Yuno tries to establish a short conversation with one of his bosses as the other one finishes the deed, getting back on the car and shooting at the gasoline to light it up. Driving away slowly to witness the explosion, Yuno and Lang freeze as they realize that a police cruiser is right across the street from them, seeing everything they just did. Tossed into the impromptu chase, Yuno does his best to gain some distance on the cruiser, which he manages due to his improved driving and with Lang's encouraging coaching. Soon, they manage to escape the two officers that were right behind them, and they rush to the North to change clothes and cars. In the middle of their trip, Lang calls Cassie and discovers that the moped he blew up wasn't Scruffy's: it was Back at the Burger Shot and reporting his car as stolen to Meeting up with Raymond outside the establishment, Yuno and Lang discover that their friend has brought Finally done with their general messing around, the group starts brainstorming and preparing for the heist, aware that their previous plan had several flaws. Choosing to use the airport as their main hub again, the group quickly sets off to block all the entrances they can find, rent out their airplanes, find their bikes and pick up their dongles (exchanging a new one with an almost expired one with Having been unable to contact Tony for the entirety of their planning, Yuno and Lang contact But luck doesn't seem to be on their side, and their heads pop at once. Having to set up their blockades once more, the group rushes to get all their vehicles back in place. Nervous as the event is about to begin, Yuno is barely surprised when, as they get inside the vault and get a single hostage, a police cruiser immediately pulls up. Scared that they might not be able to even try as the officers would surely breach, Lang, Yuno and Raymond cheer up as they discover that Tony managed to sneak out and get three more hostages. Finally able to start, Yuno easily handles the first thermite and laptop, then gets nervous and struggles on the second laptop (coming down to the third try). Waiting around and jokingly stating that he's X (prompting a violent response from With Tony driving, the crew easily out-drives most of the cops and reaches the bridge they're going to jump off. Immediately jumping off, Yuno accidentally falls on top of Tony and knocks him out without even realizing. Rushing to the shore, Yuno and Raymond get on a bike and wait a little for the others, then are forced to run away when a cruiser pulls up on them. Deciding to jump into the plane and go away, Yuno and Raymond soon discover that Lang is stranded in the ocean still, being pursued by almost all the police force and unable to do anything about it. Leaving the gold bars behind, Yuno impulsively decides to jump off the plane into the ocean so that Raymond can pick Lang up with his plane. Swimming towards the shore and hiding in a bush, Yuno is in the middle of contacting the others when fate strikes them again and everyone's heads pop. Waking up at the apartments, the group confusedly tries to figure out what to do and decides that since Tony was knocked out, he should turn himself in. As for Yuno, Lang and Raymond (since Raymond presumably would have been able to pick up Lang), they are considered to have gotten away. Reuniting outside the apartments, they split the loot and soon, Yuno has over 20,000 dollars in his bank account (from the gold and clean money), as well as over 25,000 in dirty bags and some more waiting for them in inked banks. Hanging out at the casino, Yuno confesses how nervous he was at the Vault and receives some hugs and encouraging words in return. Witnessing as Lang spends tens of thousands of dollars fueling his gambling addiction, Yuno receives a call from Afterwards, Yuno calls The trio then meets with Tony at the apartments, as he had just served his time. After a minor accident where a woman rammed their car (which ended up in Tony pulling his gun at her and demanding money for Yuno's repairs) the group, they drive Yuno's car to the fence to sell their hard earned gold bars, discussing the heist related shenanigans. Curious about what happened between NBC and CG, Yuno decides to call both parties, but neither Ramee nor Guy pick up. Parting ways with his friends after depositing his money (deciding Dean's investment strategy to clean money would be too troublesome as he had to talk to a lawyer to set it up) and hiding away his dirty money, Up-Good-Yuno drives to the city hall to get a new license (having lost his old one after his last \"trip\" to jail). He then receives a call back from Ramee, Yuno asks how he is as he was concerned for his well-being after their last call. Ramee tells the hacker he is alright, but is now planning to hunt the NBC squad down, enraged Ramee tells Yuno how Mr K and him were outnumbered (as the NBC had kidnapped Now with a bit of extra money Yuno repairs his car and checks up on some upgrades for it, deciding that he wants to improve its acceleration next. Unable to find any mechanics to do it, Yuno contacts Harry Park and asks a little about the matter, offering to pay off his debt only for Harry to say that he can take his time as he values more his friendship with Yuno. Happy, he promises that he'll contact Harry whenever he has the resources to actually modify his car. Yuno then decides to give Guy another call to check on him, Guy tells him Ramee called them and tried to get NBC to drop the heist. The crackheads refused as they had already postponed their Paleto heist for them the day before after Mr K told them CG was hitting the bank. When Guy's group reached the bank they found Jay and Uchiha guarding the bank while waiting for the rest of their squad to get there with the laptop. The NBC held them up to wait for Mr K and Ramee to get there and have them leave the bank, however CG did not hold down and started shooting their tires as soon as they saw their crew-mates being held hostages, which quickly turned into the shoot-out Ramee had told Yuno about. A disheartened Guy tells Yuno that his boys would hit the bank after the tsunami but he would be unable to join them for their first ever Paleto heist. Trying to cheer him up Yuno tells him if things line he might take Guy with him for Paleto with the dongle he got from them the day before. Yuno then tells Guy Ramee asked him to tell them were the NBC is at as he is planning on going after them, when Guy questions whether yhe hacker is going to snitch on them Yuno tells him he is not planning to, but asks him if its OK for him to call Ramee and tell him they are at Paleto, to which Guy gives his blessing. Yuno waits a little and contacts Ramee but learning he is busy dealing with the cops he calls Jay to pass Ramee the message, telling him that the NBC are right across the street from them, at the Paleto Farmer's Market, fully knowing that CG are unable to do anything as they're in the middle of their heist. Amused, and drained from the stressful day, The Vault Buster decides to go to bed and leave the money laundering for some other time. |As every other day, Yuno rushes to the | Calling With a head pop interrupting his day and waking up at the apartments, Yuno meets up with X, who has a brilliant addition to their plan: \"The Crescendo\", which consists on finishing the adventure back on a Fleeca before escaping. Giving his friend a 18,000 dollar loan and meeting up with Waving her goodbye and handing over the Dominator, Yuno takes back his Sultan and makes his way back to the apartments. There, he reunites with Calling Mickey to confirm that they're doing a Paleto plan, Yuno sets off to practice his bike riding and together with With Leyla falling off the side of the mountain, Yuno slowly reaches the abandoned energy tower on the peak of the mountain alone, confused as he finds Sasuke on a bike right there. Hearing that Sasuke, Majima and Oki Doki were on a field trip with their mysterious guide (who is now missing and \"looks like a gorilla\" according to Sasuke), Yuno decides to join the trio as they're about to do the exact same thing as him: jump off the mountain and try not to die in the process. With Leyla's arrival, the group settles on jumping off a precarious hanging antenna, with Yuno ending up on \"the poop bike\" since no one else wants it. Enthralled by Sasuke's transfer of cockra to his bike, the group quickly follows after the ninja as he performs the magnificent jump (Wicked Art Style: Bike no Jutsu), with everyone crashing and passing out except for Yuno, who masterfully bounces around and makes his way to the bottom of the mountain. Encountering Sasuke's guide (Liana) and telling her about what they'd just done, Yuno's return to civilization puts an end to the bizarre anime crossover. Finding a car and making his way back to the Pinging Ramee as he goes, Yuno is unsurprisingly captured by the dozen police officers that are trailing behind him. Still on the phone, Yuno drops subtle hints about his capture and soon, Ramee arrives in a car and heroically tries to rescue Yuno, having to flee as soon as he realizes the entire police force is on his friend. Aware that Yuno can still see his texts, Ramee informs the hacker that he's heading to the hospital in an attempt to bail Yuno out, disguising himself as a surgeon in order to save him. However, Yuno is unable to convince the officers of taking him to the hospital, instead calling EMS to the scene to help him. To make things worse, when the police call for a tow truck to pick his car, the truck driver continuously rams Yuno's car to the point it breaks down almost completely (despite the cops trying to stop it). Saddened, Yuno is taken to the police station and cadet \"PP\" gives him a very small sentence and fine, wishing him good luck, giving him some money to fix his car, asking for a hug and telling him to do better. In prison, Yuno suddenly meets an interesting group of prisoners, the lifers, who share their stories of murder and enjoy Yuno's insight into the new changes to the way the police work. Parting ways with his new friends, Yuno returns to the city and sets off to recover his car. With Harry's help, he un-impounds and fixes his car before settling for doing some Oxy-runs for the rest of the night, scamming some scammers in the process. As he picks up his delivery list, Yuno receives calls from both With Ramee dropping them off in Paleto, Mickey and Yuno wait around for Mr. K to arrive with their escape vehicle and casually talk to the hostage about buying houses and debt. Once their third member arrives, Mickey gets to hacking and easily one-shots the bank. Sharing playful banter with the responding officers and brightening up when he sees officer Once their escapade is finally over, and with few minutes before the tsunami, Yuno gifts Ramee his unused delivery list, then he and Mickey borrow Ramee's 700,000-dollars car and go for a little ride, zooming through the city as they share a heartwarming conversation about crazy plans and how they both rob banks for the fun of it. Hooking Mickey up with a job (the one with Jay), Yuno drives by the area where they left the helicopter and is disappointed to see that the police have already taken it away. Aimlessly driving, Yuno stumbles across |Ready for what is possibly the craziest heist of his career, Yuno wakes bright and early, immediately calling | Yuno grabs his car to head to the rendezvous point, with a quick stop to the City Vault to pick up his welfare check, where he runs into Arriving at the meeting place, Yuno spots X's sultan, parking right next to it, he greets all three other members of the crew. After a quick session in which they all \"flex\" a little about their financial situations they start by discussing their getaway \"plans\" and \"fundamentals\". X quickly brings to attention the need for multiple hostages from the very start of the heist, brainstorming ways to keep the hostages quiet through the whole trail to the Vault. The team also quickly covers how to go from bank to bank, a topic quickly settled on as they moved on to the most important part, the equipment. Yuno laments that he can't contribute too much as his account is not looking too well after his loan to X. Mr. Lang reassures them that Thermite has been already acquired and dealt with; having spent $35K on them earlier that day. He then brings attention to the more pending matter, the status of all three colored dongles, reminding them that they need 2 Red Dongles, 1 Blue, and 1 Green for the \"Rainbow Road\" to even be a possibility. Yuno immediately offers his Blue Dongle (acquired after his last heist with the Worried about the bank to bank drive Mr. Lang points out that the cops might figure out their end goal after they hit Paleto, X suggesting he could call one of his contacts in the media, Already having discussed everything else, from the bank to bank drive, the hostages, and the equipment, Mickey brings to everyone's attention the last (and perhaps most important) step of their plan: The getaway from the Vault. They all come to terms with what to do, with everyone having a piece to add to the pot. Their final getaway plan slowly starts taking shape, they will have a group of jet skis hidden in a beach near Paleto, each jumping on their own jetski to split the police off and distract Air1 from the one holding the loot ( the crew nominating X for the job), taking into account that the jetskis could be tampered with by the locals, Mickey asks Mr. K to lend them his private motorboat as a backup. Once they had lost the cops they could head to the aircraft carrier a few miles southeast of the ocean, where they could stash a cargobob helicopter and a car as the final step of the getaway. Taking a leaf out of Raymond's book, Yuno suggests they could all plant their personal vehicles around the city as an extreme measure, in case they needed to change into a vehicle later on the escape. Splitting the various different tasks they need to fulfill, X drives off in order to get the jetskies ready whereas Yuno, Lang and Mickey set off to get Reaching their destination, Yuno is immediately distracted by the cool military planes stored there, which sadly don't work any longer so they can't use them. Exchanging vague references to an alternate life in a place called Rust Vegas, Mickey and Yuno discover there are no cargobobs around and instead run around aimlessly as they wait for Lang to finish a phone call, jumping into the ocean from the top once the businessman tells them to return to the inner dock of the carrier. Returning slowly to the island, they adjust for the lack of cargobobs by replacing that step with water planes, then arrange to meet up with X on the other side of the island. Stopping by the airport to pick up their water planes as they're faster than their boat, the trio has a playful race to the hangar (which Yuno wins by lock-picking a little cart) before renting out the aircrafts. With Lang taking one plane, Mickey and Yuno are left to pilot the other one despite neither of them having a license. After a couple minutes of flying, they manage to land on the water and laugh hysterically when they realize that Lang has crashed his plane, even if he is the one with the license. Questioning the millionaire about the incident and laughing even harder when he explains that he crashed because he \"didn't see the sand\", Yuno parts ways with X and Mickey and takes Lang to the hospital, casually joking about the fact that they always have ridiculous accidents before they hit the Vault. At the hospital, Yuno meets a mysterious woman who claims Lang burned her alive with a molotov earlier on the day, a fact Yuno questions his friend about as soon as they leave the building. Easily accepting Lang's explanation (or rather, lack thereof), they go to a bank where Yuno reunites with With the jetskies in position and secure, Yuno returns to land and searches for a vehicle to get in. Finding a couple of strangers (Jakob and Andrew), Yuno asks for a ride before realizing their van has no space for him; settling for an SUV behind them, Yuno kicks the vehicle and unsurprisingly gets an angry local trying to hurt him. As he is handling the local, Jakob and Andrew try to help him, their efforts resulting in the local beating them both into the traffic, where multiple cars and trucks strike them until they're down. Having escaped the mess, Yuno calls paramedics and soon they're all back on their feet. Parting ways with the unfortunate pair, Yuno reunites with Lang (who's just bought a boat just because he can) and Mickey and they sail their way to the place they're going to switch from the car to the boat. Satisfied by their preparations, the group grabs their dongles and crosses the point of no return, buying all the laptops they need for their adventure. Dressing up in elegant fashion with a vague \"magicians\" theme, and polishing the last details of their plan (particularly, the hostage distribution), the group picks up their last resources before setting off on the adventure. With X and Lang picking up five hostages, Yuno and Mickey are left to hunt down an extra hostage for their show, encountering And so, the show begins. For their first act, after reaching the Sandy Shores Fleeca Bank and meeting up with X, and with Lang nowhere to be seen as the businessman hides with the remaining five hostages on the back, Yuno enters the bank with the hostage and waits for Mickey to finish the hack (which he one-shots), picking up a gun only because he needs to. As the police arrive, Yuno witnesses as X takes on the crazed persona of a man who has nothing left to lose after a failed date, deciding to take out a loan on his own after being denied more than once. Amused by his pal's stories, Yuno barely registers as time passes and soon they are leaving the bank with an average amount of loot and a blue dongle. A few seconds into the chase, however, team Rocket quickly feel uncertainty fill their bodies when they realize that the four cruisers behind them are nowhere to be seen. Concerned and terrified about the police having figured out their plan too quickly, the group rushes down the highway in order to get to Paleto before any officers can arrive. Their confusion only grows when they reach their second location, the entire place devoid of any blue-bloodded life and the bank submerged in eerie silence. Despite their growing dread, the crew decides to go on with their plan and start the second act of their plan. With Lang parking X's car on the front door and ordering the second hostage out (threatening the ones on the trunk into silence), X gets on to the hacking and calmly nails it with ease. As they wait for the vault to open, Mickey, X and Yuno lean against their car and greet the cruisers that arrive shortly before their departure. Entertaining the officers with light banter, magic tricks and flips, team Rocket are quick to get into their car as soon as they have the money and depart for the last step of the road. With few officers behind them, no violent pitting against their vehicle and no Air-1 in the sky (instead, they're being followed by the Promptly taking the money, gold and gems, Yuno and X reunite with the rest and inform the police that they're ready to leave. Handing over the hostages and entering their car, they get on to the second phase of their heist: the getaway. With Lang driving slowly to avoid slipping off, Yuno giving opportune communications and reassurance and X directing Lang via GPS to the perfect spot, team Rocket sends the car into the ocean and slowly gets into the boat, a pair of cruisers atop the cliff staring at them as they do so, unable to do anything as they wait for Air-1 and the rest of the cruisers that got stuck in the mud. Sailing at full speed and fearing that some other officers had found their jetskies, the group skips that part of their plan and go directly to the carrier, freezing over for a moment as they see Air-1 land atop the platform. With no time to waste as an officer slowly makes his way to the airplanes, the group swiftly get on the planes and Yuno ends up on the driver's seat for X. Not having the time to switch places since X doesn't have the keys, Yuno takes off in wobbly fashion and soon discovers that Air-1 and the Bumblebee are both behind him, with Quickly storing away the gold bars in his apartment, Yuno takes his car and drives in a rush to Paleto, where Lang and X are waiting for him as they hide in a hunting store. When Yuno arrives, the pair confess that they've been followed for a bit and they need to change and hide quickly, so Yuno gives the keys to Lang and they all head to a clothing store, where everyone returns to their normal attire. Closer to safety, and with the rain giving way to a beautiful sunrise, the Rainbow Road masters head towards Lang's penthouse at the casino to meet with Mickey and split their profits. However, minutes before they reach their destination Mickey, who was ahead of them, gets stopped by the police who are hunting down the robbers, searching clothing stores and any known hiding places. While on the phone Mickey warns his comrades, telling them to go as he has already changed and does not have anything illegal on him. The crew drives away, hiding inside the Digital Den for a bit as they wait for Mickey to make his way there so that they can split off the profits, Yuno and the others grow nervous with the abnormal amount of bystanders. Soon, however, they all leave and the pressure leaves their shoulders. With Mickey's arrival and after a confusing math session, they all end up with an adequate amount of small bags and inked bags to profit and compensate for their personal expenses. As for Yuno, who didn't contribute monetarily but without whom the heist wouldn't have been possible, the group agrees to give him all the clean money and gold bars, as well as some small bags to clean, instantly fixing his everlasting money issues. Parting ways at the apartments and finally replying to Mr. Lang's \"I love you\" via text (\"<3 you too\"), Yuno feels drained and struggles to pick something to do. As such, he decides on running some small errands and heads towards the Mission Row Police Station in hopes of leaving his customary sandwich and messing around with some officers; as soon as he arrives, outside the building, he catches small portions of a heated conversation between As he is there, Yuno calls Dundee to catch up with him and tells him about the heist, constantly arguing with his mentor as the Aussie tells him that Yuno has long surpassed him in terms of being a great criminal. Saddened by the way his beloved friend was talking, Yuno requests to meet at Giving Dundee a hug and receiving one in response, Yuno stares off into the sunset with his friend and, once he's distracted, picks Dundee up and pretends that he's going to throw him off the ledge. With the Aussie yelling to the top of his lungs and cursing at the mischievous hacker, Yuno laughs as he puts Dundee down and together, they go towards his car. Driving back to the apartments with light chatter as the sun hides behind the horizon, they arrange to hit the Vault together with the rest of the Season 2[ ] Part 5: Preparing for a Battle[ ] |Having successfully robbed the Vault, Yuno and his friends include the bank in their semi-regular rotation of heists, some of their plans working better than others, and a plethora of unforeseen situations bittering some of their experiences. However, they push through and their bond grows every day to the point that Lang refuses to go on big heists without the innocent hacker. It is that way that, after | Hesitant at first, Yuno accepts to join | | |Starting off his day with a couple phone calls, Yuno immediately learns from | Jumping out of his car to greet Parting ways with his friends, Yuno heads to work to steal some burgers. Getting help from Timothy as all the positions are filled, Yuno meets with Raymond and Tony, who is busy stealing While finishing setting up the plan, Yuno receive a phonecall from With their plan set, they set off to pick all the cars they need and soon, they're ready to hit the Vault. Purchasing their laptops and changing into different colored outfits in a vague reference to the Power Rangers (to go along with their multi-colored cars), the group soon heads towards the Vault and quickly kidnaps three people as they're going in. However, AJ Hunter and other officers arrive as they're collecting hostages and, unprepared, the group sends Tony to collect at least one more hostage. Getting ready to hack, Yuno soon spots Tony as he enters the bank with With Yuno soon hacking the first door, thermiting the second, and one-shotting the third, the young hacker soon sprints to the bank's front and shares playful banter with AJ Hunter and his teammates. Returning to the downstairs area, Yuno encourages X to try the thermite again and celebrates as his idol successfully breaks through not one, but the two last doors. Picking up the loot and splitting it in somewhat equal cuts, the group prepares to leave the Vault, with Yuno playfully showing off the gold he'd acquired to Getting into their car and driving away with ease, the first part of the plan goes flawlessly until they reach the exchange point and they split off into different ways: Tony manages to get away easily and gets to his house using only his motorcycle, Raymond struggles with popped tires but manages to get to one of his personal escape bikes and drives away, and X drives off quickly and finds a place to hide briefly. As for Yuno, due to a massive headache he and the officers around him suffer, he is left behind after he failed to get into X's bike (without either of them realizing). First arresting him, as soon as the officers understand what happened they release Yuno from his handcuffs, pretending that they can't see him and allowing him to try and lockpick the motorcycle left behind or Majima's car. In the process, he calls X to confirm that his head hadn't popped, which prompts the veteran hacker to go back for the confused Yuno and save him from the incredibly awkward situation. Rushing to the tunnels in order to go along with their plan, X and Yuno part ways at an intersection to try to spread the police response thin, with X immediately getting found by the officers, and Yuno catching the attention of the news helicopter (Bumblebee) despite him not seeing it. Realizing that there's no cruisers behind him, Yuno goes to the casino and changes his clothes, calling his friends to make sure that they got out and immediately contacting Tony to inform him of his whereabouts and, more importantly, of the fact that X is still being chased. Leaving the casino to try and find his friends, Yuno is surprised to find Informing X of the robbery, Yuno picks up a lost Aimlessly roaming the streets, Yuno and Raymond realize soon that the city is very quiet now, meaning the chase is likely over. Trying to call both X and Tony proves fruitless, however, which forces the pair to rush a newsstand (where they see X has been convicted), then to prison to try and find their friends. There, after an odd conversation with Arriving at the arranged location, Yuno and Hunter pick up the thermite he was promised and they drive together back to the city, casually discussing their possible future heist. Dropping Hunter at the Burger Shot, Yuno calls Raymond to confirm that he's okay and makes his way back to prison, where his friend has been patiently waiting for any of their teammates to show up to no avail. Seriously concerned by their absence, in particular Tony's as he hasn't even been convicted, Yuno contacts Talking to a dispatcher and filing a missing person's report (making up a tearful story about how they waited all night for Tony to show up at work at the Happy to actually find Tony there, and still baffled about X's apparent disappearance after his arrest, Yuno and Raymond wait around for their friend to be released and, as they wait, they meet up with members of the Chang Gang who have been sent to prison. Soon, with Ramee and Tony's input, the last piece of the puzzle falls in place and the odd happenings of the evening suddenly start to make more sense: When Tony and X were running away from the police, their car was stalled and they had to run on foot. While X was immediately captured, Tony managed to flee only to be kidnapped by However, Chang Gang's involvement didn't end there. Something that Yuno is not aware of is that while they were inside the Vault Mr. K prompted Ramee to offer via Twatter a 30,000 dollar bounty for the head of any of the other Vault robbers, a message that reached Mike Block shortly after that him, The prospect of CG's bounty added to Ron's offer convinced Mike to postpone his original plan and hunt down the Vault Robbers, marking the last of the various set of events that ultimately led to Yuno's unfortunate encounter, with the LSBN, The blocks, and more importantly Chang Gang all somehow involved, and Chang Gang being the ones who're most at fault, for they intentionally made Yuno one of the targets of the Block's assault, an altercation that could've resulted in Yuno's death had he been threatening in the slightest. Regardless, due to his ever loving and trusting nature, Yuno decides that the money (his cut) didn't matter all that much as long as he can retrieve X's thermite. Telling Ramee about his day and learning that his friend has lost a ridiculous amount of money in the past week due to his constant shoot-outs, Yuno parts ways with the Chang Gang as Tony is released, meeting him and Raymond in the parking lot and heading towards Tony's house in Paleto for an impromptu house tour, running some errands before separating from their friend for the night. Alone with Raymond, Yuno drives back to the apartments to put some stuff away and is deligthed when his friend hands over a package with 5 copies of the painting Yevgeni Ivanov made of Bimbus; excited about the beautiful item, Yuno vows to give a painting to each of his closest friends and instantly gives one to Raymond, who is moved by the gesture. Still unaware of CG involvement in his encounter with Mike, Yuno meets once again with the Chang Gang members as they're all free from prison, making amends with Uchiha and the rest and then taking Ramee to a nearby ATM in a fruitless effort to aid his friend, who denies the sweet effort and instead talks to the younger about some changes to the gallery. Inspired by the mention of art, Yuno gives Ramee one of the Bimbus paintings and tells him to put it somewhere in the new exhibits, saying goodbye to his good friend and taking off with Raymond. Drained by the eventful and confusing day, and inspired by the small house tour Tony gave them, Raymond takes Yuno to his own house and shows him around, offering Yuno the guest bedroom and some storage space for whenever the hacker needs it. Showing the always excitable Yuno to the terrace, they sit together on the rooftop and enjoy a quiet moment to unwind, relaxing as they watch cars drive by on the street below them and the soothing sounds of the ocean reaching them from behind. Running around the house a little longer, Yuno is soon taken by Raymond to PDM in order to check out some cars the Russian wants to buy, casually debating the benefits of imports over normal cars. Realizing that Raymond has a house and is trying to buy a car, and that he already has a car, Yuno decides that his next objective should be to get himself a place where he can stash items without having to worry about raids ever again. Understanding that he'd need to get someone \"clean\" to sign up the paperwork and realizing that he has no one close to him to do that, Yuno decides to worry about that after he's gathered the money to get a nice property. As such, he and Raymond embark on an adventure to check out some houses, their main focus being at Sandy Shores and Paleto. Quickly checking some apartments in the city, they soon reach the desert and discover that they don't really like any of the houses. Still, they take note of a coupleof affordable properties (less expensive than Yuno's car) and follow on their path, soon reaching Grapeseed and taking a quick look at a few cute houses before being chased off by armed locals. Casually stopping for gas and stealing the money in the cash register to make Raymond hurry up, the pair travel all the way up north to Paleto and immediately fall in love with a series of beautiful houses near Tony's place, quickly realizing that the side of the street that's closer to the beach is much more expensive than the houses on the opposite side. Going from property to property, Yuno and Raymond find a bunch of houses that are around the 230,000 dollars mark, and quickly settle on one particular place they both really liked, with a nice patch of grass, a walkway up to the property and enough space for a couple of cars on the side. As the tsunami hits the town, and with a new goal in mind, their lighthearted adventure reaches its end and they share a tender goodbye before ending their day. |Up and ready Yuno begins his day by giving a call to | With this in mind, Yuno gets in contact with his sister, As the group is driving around the city nearly the entire police department surrounding the Morgue, figuring out Mr. Lang must be somewhat involved, Yuno gives him a call to check up on him and wish him luck. Later he gives calls to his police friends to ask about their well-being however he is only able to get in contact with The duo then goes to meet up with Ray who has gone to Benny's after being let go by the police there they meet Marveled by what just happened, Yuno's companions tease the hacker, wondering whether they actually need to take any precautions since they have a \"Yuno-shield\" with them as no one would rob the friendly criminal. Flustered Yuno tries to deny it, telling them how even though he knows \"a few\" criminals in the city that doesn't make him immune, reminding his sister of his tragic encounter with Traveling to their next spot, Yuno receives a call from Dundee, who seems to be hiding away from the police on a secluded rooftop and is in need of a pickup. The hacker tells his companions he needs to go help his friend, giving Ray his bags and promising to return as soon as possible before running down the street to try and find a vehicle. Driving to Dundee's location Yuno picks the man up at an obscure alley, Dundee explaining he managed to avoid the cops' notice but was worried they might spot him when walking down the street. The duo heads back to the apartments so that Yuno can pick up his car, Dundee driving away to do his own oxy-run. At the apartment parking lot, Yuno runs into Randy, who by now has heard about the Mike Block incident from Garret. the British man reprimanding Yuno for not coming to him immediately. Yuno is quick to reassure his friend that he is working up a deal with Mike, telling him about his plan to teach the As they are regrouping, Yuno receives another call from Mr. Lang, who seems to be heading to bed soon. Not wanting to keep him waiting he takes his car (to Ray's distress) and drives to the Casino. There he is amused to find both Mr. Lang and X gambling at the high roller table, the latter asking Yuno about his own escape from the Vault (seeing as X himself had been caught by the cops after they split). Yuno shares the sad news to the shock of his companions, Mr. Lang immediately offering to kill the robber in retaliation, while grateful for the gesture Yuno tells him he is in the process of getting his money back. Mr. Lang then hands Yuno his $75K cut for an old Vault heist as the inked bags have finally dried. An excited Yuno tells him that with this he is now closer to buying a house as he is in the process of cleaning his dirty money, Mr. Lang congratulates the hacker, asking to be his roommate whenever he gets it, to which the hacker agrees, sharing he is unsure on how to find someone \"clean\" to sign the house up to. Yuno runs back to meet with an irate Ray, who tells Yuno off for once again leaving them at the oxy-spot, telling him \"a ranger\" keeps circling the area. Apologizing for the trouble Yuno tries to calm his sister down while driving back to their location. As he is driving down the alley he runs into Ranger Conan who was \"the ranger\" circling the block in hopes of catching them red-handed. Yuno distracts the Ranger for a while, helping Garret notice him before driving around the block to try and pick up the rest of their crew. Not being able to contact his friends Yuno is left to look for them by foot in the neighboring alleys, eventually regrouping with Ray and Natalie. The trio heads back to their oxy car in hopes the Ranger has decided to move on, only to find from Garret that the Ranger has left in pursuit of Dundee, who had just pulled down to start selling oxy at that very same spot. Not wanting to risk it the crew decides to leave the job for another day. On their drive back, Yuno tells his companions he needs to get some briefcases to stash the money Mr. Lang just gave him, nervous about carrying over $90K on his person. Shocked by the amount his friends quickly agree and they head over to the MegaMart, Garret talking to \"a friend\" on the phone on their way there. Said friend turned out to be Randy, who is there to \"rob the man with $90K\". Willing to go with their shenanigans Yuno lifts his hands up, handing his money to the Britisher, the group catches up with Randy telling them about the shootout with the police earlier that morning, and Ray telling on Yuno for leaving them mid-oxy-run, which soon devolved in a bickering session between the siblings. While Randy is distracted by Garret and Natalie, Yuno pulls Ray aside and convinces her to rob Randy back, the twins soon pulling their guns up and returning the \"favor\". With his money back Yuno gives some cashback to Randy in addition to a few marihuana-infused gummy worms. The group soon disbands as Ray shoots at the air, worried the police might be alerted by the gunshots. Not long after they regroup at the apartments, Yuno convincing them to start a \"newbies race\" between Garret, Natalie, and Yuno himself, asking for Randy's help in organizing the whole event. Seeing as he is the only one with a car the group drives around the city to find cars for the rest of the crew before heading up to Paleto. Yuno parts with them momentarily to get his car repaired at As he is catching up with X, the veteran bank-buster invites Yuno to an impromptu Vault heist, as he is in dire need of money given the events of their previous work together. Having just enough thermite for the job the duo drives around the city, brainstorming about possible escape plans. Having no luck in contacting Dundee, they soon call for |(Heist with X, Tony, Lang, and Yuno) | (To be written.) |Starting the day off by fixing his car, Yuno immediately finds members of the | Going back to the apartments, Yuno parks his car and meets with With Lang taking him back to the apartments so that he can show X to the warehouse, Yuno \"tearfully\" shares the story behind his firing to Encountering Mr. K and Ramee as they all wait in line to buy food, the trio steps to the side to share a short conversation in which Ramee asks if Yuno has some meth for them. Admitting that he has one baggie, the Chang Gang members suddenly become concerned that he's an addict and try to have an intervention, handcuffing him and questioning him relentlessly as they cry. Dropping the bit son after, Mr. K and Ramee pick up their food and Yuno orders 87 donuts as a joke; laughing at Shelly's shocked voice, he withdraws the fake order and requests for seven Heartstoppers, wishing CG good luck for their endeavors as they leave. As he waits for his food, Yuno tries to talk to Stating that Yuno wasn't really fit for the kitchen, Shelly brings up the fact that Yuno could be very useful in the marketing department, his responsibilities relying on him and X organizing weekly events and generally promoting the restaurant. Discussing briefly the events from the previous day and making amends, Yuno is thrilled to hear that his new position is \"marketing consultant\", and that he'll get approximately 10,000 dollars per event. Showing off the fact that he kept his work outfit, they continue their conversation in the bathroom and have an awkward encounter with the sweet Giving X a phone call and agreeing to meet at the apartments, Yuno calls Remembering to pick up Ramee's meth, Yuno leaves his apartment and calls his friend so that he can pick the stuff up before Yuno becomes stranded on the mountain. However, for good or for bad, Ramee has already acquired the substance and no longer needs it. Jokingly sharing the fact that he's going to ride a bike and might not make it, Yuno hangs up and offers the meth to a passing Landing near the hunting lodge by Paleto so that they can take some bikes, Yuno and Lang briefly separate from the group to take a backup car and they share a small conversation about Lang's \"toy heist\", where three of the most influential people in the city tried to steal all the Burger Shot toys in hopes of finding the ever-elusive Yuno toy. As they are discussing the marvelous heist, they see a familiar yet unnerving sight: a police cruiser. Soon, however, they discover the driver to be no other than Park Ranger As the ranger leaves, and after receiving a call from the man who's hunting As soon as Yuno is back on his feet, and desperate to find their missing friends, the duo returns to the mountain and take a compact car to approach the top, then get on their bikes and soon spot the gnarly sight of an abandoned ambulance at the foot of the mountain. After an extraneous search that involves gravity-defying physics and a ridiculous amount of YouTube videos on Lang's side, and having separated from Mickey as the man decided to test out the helicopter for a bit, Yuno manages to find Lang on the side of the mountain, his legs broken and his spirits down after being stranded for hours. However, in an unfortunate twist of fate, as soon as Yuno spots his beloved boss, he slips by and accidentally breaks a few bones himself, managing to land right next to his original bike in a way that has Yuno wondering if Grandma's was all a dream. For good or for bad, he doesn't get to think much more about it as Mickey, the missing EMS, and Ranger Tessa arrive on the foretold helicopter. Picking up Yuno with ease, the group pilots their way up to the location where Lang has been waiting, witnessing as Tessa jumps down the helicopter and grabs Lang in a heroic effort befitting a ranger. Getting back on the helicopter, the group finally manage to return to civilization and soon learn that X has been out of the precarious wilderness for a while. After getting out of the hospital they decide to go and give the mountain a second try, this time getting BMX bikes and making sure to stick to the bike trails. However, as they are leaving, Mr. Lang receives a call from an officer, who tells him that they had locked his apartment when he had been reported missing, an action that the officer can nullify if Lang were to meet with him. Returning on foot to the apartments, Yuno and Mickey wait patiently as the millionaire deals with his issue, with X taking the opportunity to steal the cop's cruiser. Assuming this is one of X's trademark offerings to the dragon, Yuno tries to run interference by \"accidentally\" blocking the door to the apartment lobby while talking to Watching as X drives away in the stolen vehicle, Yuno and Lang take X's car and hide it at the top of the red garage in hopes to keep it from being stolen. However, as they are driving around the city with Mickey, looking for BMX bikes, Lang finds out X has been nearly corralled by the police and is in need of a pickup. They head back to get X's car, with Lang driving it off the roof of the garage and zooming away to rescue their fallen comrade. Left alone with nothing to do, Mickey and Yuno wander around the city, in hopes of finding either of their friends only to be dismayed to hear X has been caught, and Lang has decided to go to bed early and catch a basketball game. Briefly catching up with Quickly robbing a house in the middle of the barrio, Yuno is disappointed when he is unable to find any green dongles. With the sun rising on the horizon, the duo realize they won't be getting any more house jobs and settle for some Oxy runs instead, briefly discussing Ramee's ongoing war against the grinders. Picking up a delivery list and learning from Charles that Chang Gang are about to hit the Vault, Yuno receives a call from Wingman, who asks if Yuno is currently robbing the Vault. Offering him some intel under the belief that Yuno is inside (despite his denial), the Block vaguely alludes to the idea of robbing the Vault hitters, which prompts Yuno to warn him about not messing with this group as they will not be as understanding as he was. He does, however, make it sound like he was hacking throughout the call, leaving Wingman in a confused state as Yuno hangs up in amusement. Heading north to pick the delivery list, the duo briefly pass in front of the Vault and crash with the aforementioned Block, causing the police officers in the vicinity to threaten them all with guns so they leave. Picking up the delivery list, Mickey and Yuno wait to get the job and goof around the city, showing each other useful tricks to increase their chances of outrunning the cops, shooting a car and robbing some grocery stores as they go. Eventually, they head back to the apartments to get their money bags and get ready to sell some Oxy, with Yuno changing into his \"Ramee Outfit\", and picking up his spare gun. While waiting for Mickey to come back from his apartment, Yuno runs into Driving towards the pick-up spot and gifting Mickey a little Gameboy, the pair shortly arrive at their first drop-off location and share a discussion about Sun Tzu's art of war, establishing a code-word for when the police arrive, and quickly leaving the spot when no one shows up. Going to the second location, Yuno immediately spots the figure of a lurking man on the phone, a sight that has him pull out his gun and seek for a vantage point to protect Mickey. Pointing his gun at the man's head and with his finger hovering on the trigger, Yuno notices the various patches on the man's jacket and soon realizes that it is no other than With their run done, they take a new car and head back to the apartments to hide away their illegal stuff and change. Meeting with Successfully finishing his job, Yuno goes along with Mickey and Ramee to deliver the gems and check how much money they got, then head to the Calmly going through their second Oxy-run, Yuno and Mickey discuss the possibility of an \"Among Us\" themed heist, where the robbers take six hostages, they all dress in different colors, and the cops have to pick who the robbers are. Excited about the wonderful idea, Yuno wishes that they can do it at some point and shares that perhaps Lang would be up for it. Soon, and with their runs done, the duo returns to the apartments so that Yuno can go to bed. Before he goes, however, he receives a call from Ken-sama who wants to do a noob race, a fact Yuno relies on to Mickey who happily agrees to join. With the day over, Yuno enters his apartment and organizes his room, then lays down on his bed and falls asleep. |Starting off his day with the intention of retrieving his car, Yuno leaves the apartments and promptly meets with | Leaving the courthouse, Yuno decides to go to the fence to sell some Oxy he's carrying in his pockets, meeting with a couple nice friends who once tried to give him a ride (only for hilarity and chaos to ensue), With that thought in mind, and as he drives back to the city, Yuno goes through his contact list slowly in hopes of finding someone at least \"semi clean\" that can hold on to his stuff for a little while. Deciding that the safest choice would be Calling the sweet redhead, Yuno is shocked to hear that the infamous Driving away and butting in on a random conversation some parking attendants were having (about a war they're waging against the park rangers), Yuno soon gives the ever adorable Meeting again with officer Mina Price (who gives him a hug) and Claire (who shares her dream of owning a Mustang), Yuno gets his racing dongle and receives a spine-chilling call from Ash, who has just seen X run away from the cops and is worried that it might be related to Yuno. Promising that it's okay and telling her to be careful, Yuno sets off to try to find his juicy friend to save him and once he contacts him, discovers that the reason behind his warrant is the murder of 4 police officers. Bonding over their disdain towards the new rules that allow voice identification, Yuno hangs up with X and sends Lang a message to inform him that they want to do a Paleto later during the day. Purchasing a VPN and a racing dongle (on accident), Yuno passes by the Vault and gets scolded by Approaching the officer and his partner, Calling X to make sure that he's okay, the crazed pair decide to rob Paleto by themselves as neither of them can get a hold on Lang. With X buying a boat for their needs, they quickly settle on a simple, boring and very effective plan: drive a car into the ocean, and sail around the island until the cops get bored of them. Arranging to meet up at the apartments, Yuno drives slowly and somehow manages to crash against an SUV, who he soon discovers is occupied by his twin sister, Taco and the Randy. Discussing his plan, Yuno is surprised to hear Randy's approval, with the veteran criminal telling him that \"rat plans\" are all the criminals have left when considering the recent police force. Wishing them luck in their Oxy run and offering to give the totally-struggling Randy some money, Yuno leaves with a faint smile on his face as he readies himself for what comes next. Setting up for their heist the duo take a man hostage outside of the Harmony's Fleeca Bank, forcing the man into their sports car trunk and driving towards Paleto. The dichotomy of their characters more obvious than ever, with X frequently threatening their hostage with torture and death, and Yuno quickly reassuring the terrified man he would be fine (as long as he behaved), trying to make small chitchat with the hostage (with some violent comments coming from X here and there). Their good criminal/bad criminal dynamic worked well enough to keep the hostage in check through the drive and subsequent bank robbery, with X going as far as threatening an onlooker to hold the hostage's less than legal items to prevent them from being seized by the police, to the surprise and admiration of his fellow criminal. As they were getting ready to leave an ominous storm rained upon them, and after a bumpy ride away from the bank the duo managed to get to the \"launch point\", with X driving their car into the ocean. Their ship had been carried a bit further from their location, however after a longer than expected swim being followed by Air1, the duo got to it only to find it smoking up. With their escape plan thwarted and the police soon approaching them the duo split in the midst of all the chaos, Yuno trying to swim to the beach where he had hidden his car, only to find police cars waiting for him. With no other option than try to lose them by swimming among the waves, Yuno tried to get in touch with some of his criminal friends to arrange for a pickup, Randy soon referring him to Bidding Dundee goodbye Yuno decided to go back to the apartments, giving a call to Intrigued by this event Yuno headed over to the store, scouting the area for possible entry points without much success. as he is wandering around the city hall Yuno receives a call from Not long after he receives a text from Yuno then heads over to the Wanting to avoid any further awkwardness, Yuno tells Raymond he has temporarily stashed his illegal items at Ash's apartment. At Raymond's offer to store them at his house while Yuno figures out a more permanent solution, the duo then pick Ash up from the Burger Shot to get Yuno's belongings. Thanking the redhead for her help they all catch up outside of Raymond's house until the Tsunami hits the city. |(| Part 6: Clean Heists and Deeper into the Vault[ ] |Learning about new heists available in the city, Yuno and his crew have a go at the Vangelico Jewelry Store, the 24/7 safes, and at the curious security trucks that roamed around the city for a few days, their individual ventures revealing the fact that there is much more to the Vault than what they've already learned, and that to get inside the Lower Vault they need equipment from the Bobcat Security facility (which they can't enter as there are no more trucks in the city), and a Golden Dongle.

A few moments later he is spotted by LaFlare, who takes the hacker to the hospital, heading to the Burger Shot to meet with Lenny as soon as Yuno is back on their feet. Splitting the loot they head back to the apartments, but soon stop as Yuno spots a familiar Lamborghini at a stoplight, thinking someone has stolen After wandering around the city waiting for his regular crew to start planning their hit on the Vangelico Jewelry Store, he manages to get in touch with With the vehicles full of \"contestants\", the group heads over to the paintball arena, Yuno quickly informing Back at the city the crew finally got a chance to catch up with each other, Lang informing them about his recent involvement in breaking into the Bobcat Security Building, and Yuno and Ray sharing the information they have gathered about the Jewelry Store. After scouting the area the group soon starts setting up their escape plan, on which they would drive from the store into the city tunnels, where they would switch to bikes. Having a couple of bikes stashed in the tunnels Yuno and Raymond parted from the rest of their crew to get additional \"back-up\" vehicles almost ready to get the show going. After driving around the city for a while, the duo grew concerned about the silence from the senior criminals, especially after a sudden blackout that left the whole city in complete darkness (which Yuno later found was caused by CG). They headed back to the tunnels to plant an additional car and hopefully find Mr. Lang and Tony, but as they were navigating the underground they were surprised to run across an ambulance which was headed in the same direction of their rendezvous point. Fearing the worst, Yuno convinces Raymond to leave the tunnels in case their partners have gotten caught by the cops, opting instead to wait at the Pillbox Hospital to learn more about the situation, the duo doing a quick stop at Raymond's house for him to pick up a gun in order to try and rescue their fallen friends. A few minutes later they finally see an ambulance coming to the hospital, followed by a single cruiser. Spotted by the cops, the duo is questioned as the ambulance identified a couple of men wandering around the tunnels, Yuno quickly diverting their attention by pretending to be fishing for information regarding the blackout, showering the Officer with questions regarding the ongoing events at The Vault. The Officer takes his leave, not wanting to unwittingly reveal any confidential information, Yuno immediately being jumped by four men, all participants of the Hunger Games. The men are not too happy about having been robbed, especially as their money and phones were not returned to them after the show was over. Yuno tries to calm them down, claiming he was just a spectator and not an organizer himself. When questioned about who hired him, Yuno is quick to once again blame Raymond informs Yuno he is planning on shooting down the two cops on the scene, confident they will be able to get away as it is likely most of the cops on duty will be busy at the Vault. Yuno is not too convinced about this line of action, as Raymond is the only one that has a gun, and any shots at the hospital tend to be responded to by the police quite quickly, however, he agrees to help Raymond get their friends to their vehicle and dash away before any backup comes. Yuno walks inside the hospital to get a look at the situation while Raymond waits outside, taking cover behind the EMS ambulance. Inside the hospital, Yuno finally encounters Mr. Lang and Tony, who have been patched up and are being escorted out in handcuffs. As soon as the officers step out, Raymond shoots one of them down, the other one running for cover. Not wasting more time and wanting to get their friends out of the crossfire, Yuno picks up the one nearest to him, Tony, with Raymond taking care of Mr. Lang while still trying to shoot the remaining officer. Unfortunately, their rescue plan was not the best and Yuno has to run with Tony through the parking lot in the midst of bullets flying all over the place. Getting shot himself Yuno manages to take cover behind a car, hiding a bleeding Tony inside in hopes of keeping him safe. Before Yuno is able to come up with an escape plan (and unable to open the doors of the car he put Tony in), backup arrives, and Yuno flees the scene not wanting to attract attention to Tony in hopes of picking him up once the cops leave the scene. His fickle hope is dashed away as Raymond is downed not long after, Tony eventually behind found after the cops scouted the area. Waiting to hear about what happened to his friends, Yuno drives around the area. After running into Ursula, the news reporter eagerly tells him the information she has collected regarding the attempt at the Vault, having managed to slip inside before the officers got to locking everything back up. Bidding his informant goodbye and thanking her for the help, Yuno calls Ramee to warn him about the police response and inquire about their attempt at unlocking the Vault's Laser room, guessing by Ramee's subjugated behavior the outcome was not as positive as they had expected. Ramee seems reluctant to share too much information with the young hacker, claiming he doesn't want to \"spoil it\" since they promised to share the intel with Lang, however after some prying Yuno is able to get information on how they cut the city's electricity. Yuno eventually finds his friends have been sent to prison, visiting them to learn about their side of the story. There, Raymond informs him the cops might come after Yuno as they suspect his involvement in the failed rescue. Yuno keeps this in mind, despite not having found any warrants on his name at the moment, then sharing with the crew what he learned from Ramee. As Raymond's time has been served he drives the man back to the city, dropping him at the apartments. While waiting for him at the parking lot he decides to give an extra try at getting information about CG's heist, calling |Leaving his apartment and immediately finding | Quickly arranging for everything, they grab With the chase over, Yuno and Raymond regroup at the Rooster's, where they wait for Tony and Lang to return after selling their loot; as he is there, Yuno discovers that he's been fired by an unknown employee (who turns out to be Escaping before he loses all his money, Yuno says goodbye to Finally locating the down-bad Raymond, they start driving around and soon locate a bizarre sight: Mr. Lang walking down the middle of the road, calmly as if he has nothing to do.

Searching for cars to use to save people, Yuno and Wingman embark on an adventure up mount Chillead to rescue the rest. Ending up on a bike, Yuno makes his way up and finds the aforementioned Block knocked down next to two passed out people. Picking up his friend and a random girl, Yuno drives them both back to civilization and searches for his car (which 4T was taking care of) before heading back up for the others, making a brief stop at the Burger Shot for some fries. Driving through the mountain in a small buggy he finds at the side of the road, Yuno tries his best to try and find any remaining victims, the car constantly flipping over and lacking the traction it needs to go up. Returning to the lumberjack station, Yuno finds one of Oki Doki's friends, who informs him that the remaining injured people are currently being lifted up by the EMS helicopter. Slowly returning to the city one last time, Yuno fixes his car and goes to Pillbox to visit the injured, finding Raymond laying down on a bed. To complete his little shoe heist, Yuno steals his friend's shoes and flees, returning to the apartments and ending his hectic day. |Arranging his loot from his shoe heist, Yuno leaves the apartment and immediately stumbles across | Deciding to use Lang's boat for the escape, the group sails into the canals and immediately gets the vehicle stuck. Already used to the traditional scuff, Yuno finds a nice hefty truck and uses it to push the stranded boat back into water; however, the engine is busted, so they take the truck again and drive away to pick up a repair kit. As they drive, Lang officially invites Yuno to become a As they drive around, planning as they go, Mr. Lang receives a call from Returning to the Burger Shot, Yuno is in the middle of making his food when he overhears a familiar voice. Going outside, he finds Driving around aimlessly as he waits for the members of his squad to be free, he receives a call from a downtrodden Yuno stops by the They switch cars and set off to plan their escape, given the loot from Raymond's previous hit at the vault they are hoping they will also be able to find a Gold dongle for their own group. With this dongle being crucial for advancing deeper into the Vault they decide to give it along with the rest of the loot to one member of the crew, with the other three doing their best to attract the police's attention so that their comrade is able to escape. Knowing Yuno's reluctance for shooting cops Mr. Lang tells them the hacker should be the one to escape, as they will start shooting cops to attract the police response should the hacker tell them he is at risk of getting caught. As such the group plans to drive to a construction site, where three of them will jump into a different car, with Yuno escaping into a golf cart down an elevator, hidden by the other's vehicle, changing to a motorcycle and using one of the ramps of the construction site to jump into the highway. As they're planning, Yuno becomes very quiet, slowly realizing that not only he has to deal with a presumed improvement in the Vault's security system (as Raymond had told them both Arriving at the bank and effortlessly finding five hostages inside, Yuno nervously starts hacking and easily breaks through the first, second, and third doors without any difficulties. Given this series of successes, the hacker becomes a bit more confident, seeing the Vault's security was for the most part the same. Messing around with Trooper AJ Hunter (who calls Yuno on the phone as usual) and Taking off, Yuno follows the track Lang had shown him with one cruiser behind him; however, as more cruisers start showing up, he decides that going into the tunnels is risky and instead chooses to avoid the cops on the streets. After some quick turns the hacker manages to lose the cruisers, driving under the highway and tunnels to avoid being spotted by Air1 he makes his way to the airport to pick up his car. As he is nearing the airport's parking lot Yuno crashes his bike into a bush and decides to run on foot, a cop driving by and ignoring him completely since he couldn't recognize his outfit (lacking his trademark glowing shoes) and didn't have his bike. Surprised by the uncanny incident, Yuno hides in the trunk of his car for a little while, then decides that he's out of the heat and starts driving without his helmet or mask. Calling Mr. Lang and making sure that they're all good, Yuno is heading up to Paleto to meet with Tony and Lang when the former calls him and tells him to flee, for there is a cop in the area searching for them. Obeying the order and sending Ray their way after the Russian called him to tell him he had gotten away, Yuno heads to the apartments and hides everything. Driving around for a bit, sharing intel with As Tony learns that Yuno has over 600 bags to clean, and with no clear timeline for the Vanilla unicorn to become fully functional, the man suggests that they sell them to With their messing around done, the group decides to do their Paleto heist at last.

As he is leaving, he stumbles across Settling on doing a quick house job, Yuno remembers the strategy As he and the Aussie drive away, they encounter the weirdest of sights: With Dundee having a plan in mind, Yuno and Raymond sit around as the veteran driver shows them around. Picking up a few motorcycles and three Dominators, they stash them all in different levels of the red parking lot, the plan being that the helicopter will see the Dominators on the roof and assume that they're heading there when in reality they're getting to the third floor and getting on some bikes. With their plan set up in its majority, the trio splits for a bit to get some resources and run some errands: Dundee goes fix up the car, Ray goes to the hospital to pick his girlfriend After a talk with Dundee (who's planning on messing with the cops by making Yuno do his usual shenanigans, but instead of leaving sandwiches they'd leave highly illegal items to freak the cops out), and waiting around some more until the sun comes out, the group finally depart to the bank and get themselves a hostage. Inside the bank itself, Yuno lets Raymond get the first hack (as the Russian has shown interest in learning how to hack) and takes over when his friend messes up. With the hack done and time to kill, Yuno returns to the front room of the bank and discovers that Dundee has stolen the hostage's booze and has gotten very drunk. A little concerned about the driver's status, Yuno takes over the negotiations and has a pleasant conversation with Getting in the car, the trio starts driving away, Dundee's driving a little wobbly since he drank an entire bottle of whisky (among some other things). However, the rush of the chase soon replaces his drunken stupor and the Aussie once again demonstrates why he's considered one of the best getaway drivers in the city. Effortlessly losing most cops and constantly juking the rest, Dundee is unable to understand why they keep coming back until Yuno realizes something terrible: the helicopter that's been on them all along, which they believed was the Getting on their bikes and taking the jump, the group goes in three different directions, and, to Yuno's misfortune, the helicopter chooses to pursue the hacker. Trying to drive away and losing most of the land units on multiple occasions, Yuno's inexperience in escaping helicopters becomes evident when he crashes once, then twice, and soon, he gets tazed off his bike by officer Lenny Hawk. Disappointed that he couldn't get away but amused at the nice chase he had, Yuno accepts the loss and decides to enjoy his capture, greeting politely all the officers that arrive and realizing that most of them are his friends: Arriving at His fears only grow bigger when he encounters Sharing the tales he heard in prison with Guy and Dean, Yuno fulfills his promise and calls Dundee, informing him of Freddy's fate and trying to dissuade the Aussie from shooting at Wrangler in the face. Calling Raymond to make sure that their blue dongle is safe and sharing the same information with him, Yuno is on board on his plan to mess Wrangler up (his way more legal than Dundee's), and shares his concerns about doing the job with NBC. Despite agreeing that the best option is to hack-and-dip, Yuno opts to decide after seeing the plan that Guy Jones has prepared, and feels as unnerved as before as everything is explained to him: they'd drive to the junkyard, block off the entrance with a truck (in which Reaching the apartments to change, Yuno grows more and more nervous and decides to just hack for the group and leave quickly, receiving a call from Riley in the process and confirming the fate of Freddy to the kind woman. Ending his conversation with her, Yuno returns to the car and Dean immediately kidnaps a man, not realizing that officer Reducer is right behind them and has witnessed the crime. Driving to Hayes to fix their car, then to a Fleeca that's already been hit, then to the actual Fleeca they're hitting, the group does their best to remain calm in order to keep the hacker relaxed. Quickly doing his part and realizing that he can't leave now even if he wants to, Yuno calls Raymond and shares the bitter news with him, his friend offering some help in case Yuno needs it (not during the actual chase). Saying goodbye to the Russian, Yuno walks to the front and realizes that the exact same officers from the previous Fleeca are there, putting him in a very awkward position since he'd pinkie-promised that he wouldn't do more crime. Talking to the officers and asking them about how parole works, Yuno gifts Reducer the same painting she gave him the last time he got caught, telling her how he just got it from Dean's World when she questions the criminal, already suspecting it is the friendly hacker. Yuno's anxiety is at its maximum by the time they leave the bank and he makes sure to say his last goodbyes to Raymond as he notices the fact that one of the best drivers in the force, John Charleston, is right on their tails. Successfully making it to the opening where the truck (and Alan) is, the trio doesn't have time to sing victory as Charleston manages to get through by ramming into the barrier at high speed. Watching as Alan is getting tackled and uncertain of the man's fate, Yuno and the rest try to make it to their switch-up place only for them to miss the entry, opting to run around the block before trying again and getting pushed by Charleston this time. With no plan left and no other ideas, Guy Jones is forced to drive and, through some really sneaky tricks and mere skill, they soon manage to lose track of all the officers. Switching vehicles, changing clothes, and thanking Chang Gang in their minds for taking Air-1 away from them, the group make their way to the city and become elated when they discover that Alan somehow got away. Now relieved, Yuno is soon dropped at the apartments and he says goodnight to the lovely Guy Jones (who once again promises to always have his back), changing back into his normal clothes and calling Raymond to mess around with him. As such, Yuno pretends that he's been caught and they've allowed him a phone call to his lawyer (who's apparently now Raymond), feeding his friend lies about how he's going to get raided and how he accidentally got the person who has his stash under investigation; pretending that he accidentally mentioned Kitty's name, Yuno then tells Raymond to pick him up at the apartments so that they can talk, the comment enough for the Russian to start suspecting about everything being a prank. Calling officer Reducer to brag about the fact that he just made 10,000 dollars from doing a \"legal\" job, Yuno swiftly gets on the back of Raymond's bike (with the Russian finally catching up on the joke) and they go to Kitty's house. Putting away stuff, Raymond shows Yuno around the house and takes him to his new office, promising that the hacker can come by any time. Discussing their Vault plans for the next day, the duo leaves the house and soon encounters a wild Dundee, who has somehow gotten his hands on a SWAT bulletproof van. With Raymond immediately freaking out and demanding that Dundee gets away from the house as he thinks it is a cop magnet. The Russian however is left with no choice but to join them when Yuno immediately hops in, not wanting to abandon his friend. The trio drives around for a few minutes and discusses what they should do with the terribly illegal van. At first, suggesting that they go freak some Oxy runners out, Yuno soon figures out a much more entertaining plan and calls officer Reducer once more, implying that he's been kidnapped by a random man and that he needs help. While Raymond is changing his outfit at a store Yuno decides to up the stakes, pinging officer Tyme to their location. The crazed trio starts driving around the city, doing a quick stop for Raymond to drop his very illegal gun in a bush. Talking about what they want to do with the van, and with Yuno quietly telling officer Tyme their whereabouts (which Dundee immediately caught up on, yet didn't mind as he himself was in search of a chase), they are soon discovered by a police cruiser and their little ride turns into a chaotic mess as more and more units arrive at the scene of the very severe crime. Driving like the maniac pro that he is, Dundee is able to give the cops a fun chase as Yuno and Raymond pretend to be hostages at times, cops at other times. Soon, however, their fun is interrupted when they get stuck on a tricky corner and are unable to move due to the units boxing them in. With Watching as Dundee is taken away and convincing the officers of firing the cool guns stashed at the back of the van, Yuno and Raymond decide to go home and are abruptly stopped by Picking up |Waking up and getting ready for the busy day, Yuno gets a ride to the | Driving up to Getting into a car so they can go to the airport, Yuno receives a call from Retrieving the plane they had and renting another one, they attempt their landing again and soon have a violent encounter with some crazed locals who shoot at them. Killing them and leaving the premises for a bit (to make sure that no cops show up), the group returns promptly and takes care of the bleeding Lang. Going to Raymond's house for some Oxy (and an Akuma), the team splits up in two groups: Lang and Tony go find two four-doors, Yuno and Raymond go in search for another bike. Fixing up the bike and taking them to the docks, Raymond and Yuno place them in their adequate position and, as they walk up to the planes to check on them, they accidentally blow up. Confused as to what happened, the downed pair laugh at their misfortune as they wait for their comrades to find them. With Tony spotting Yuno's shoes in the distance, Lang welcomes them into the Scuffbois and helps them into Tony's car, then leaves to his weed farm since he needs to kill some Blocks. Parting ways with Lang, Tony takes them to the hospital and Yuno engages in a pleasant conversation with Checking up on the boat, fixing up the car, driving to Yuno's apartment to pick up some thermite and making their way to Raymond's house, they get the rest of their supplies and go buy the laptops, sharing a session of animal impersonations on the way to Sandy Shores. Getting a new car and making a call to Taking a deep breath, Yuno and Lang pick up the loot and cheerfully celebrate when Lang finds the golden dongle. Leaving the bank in a happy yet nervous rush, and with Lang carrying everything but the gold bars, the group makes their way up the highway to the mountains in the eastern side of the island, leaving the roads and going down the side of the mountain with masterful skills that the cops struggle to match. Bumping into a bush and struggling to pick up speed again, the group takes a jump and, instead of landing in the canals, they land on the highway, a move that not even the officers were expecting to the point that a couple of them flipped over in confusion. With the lucky turn of events, Tony continues driving and gets to the canals, driving for a bit then sending the car into the water so they can get in the boat. Sailing away, they promptly arrive at the Mayweather docks and get on their bikes, then on their airplanes, with Raymond deciding to fly away first since the helicopter (that's right in front of them) will likely go after the first ones to take off. Soon, the theory proves right and Air-1 tails behind them, letting Lang and Tony escape with ease and, due to the speed of the planes, Raymond and Yuno reach safety in minutes as well. Communicating over the radio and joyfully sharing that they're all okay, Yuno and Raymond fly towards the airport in Sandy Shores to distract any officers from going to Paleto, where Tony plans on landing and going up to his house. Their decision proves useful again when a cruiser immediately runs after them, Raymond's eagle eyes catching it just in time to take off again and find another location to land. Making his way to the beach by Splitting up their (menial) lot and setting off to put everything in a safe spot, Yuno and his friends have a relaxing trip back to the city, the sound of Lang and Tony arguing indicating that their little adventure is for sure done. Storing the golden dongle in the warehouse, giving Raymond some thermite (in case the Bobcat Security truck comes around), and going to Raymond's place to hide away the youngsters' cut, the group shares a wholesome moment by the beach (where they lean and talk about Accepting with ease as long as they help him un-scuff his car and fix it when they're done, Yuno hops inside Ramee's car and they quickly make their way to the docks, easily locating the vehicle and staring in surprise at the officer who was lockpicking it.

Ending the call after receiving a message from trooper Meeting up with Arriving at Hayes and discovering that they still need to wait a few minutes, Jones and Yuno infiltrate the office and Guy playfully pretends to be an undercover cop, with Yuno immediately pointing out that he has a warrant. Taking the car and accepting Timothy's nice gifts (and a random mackerel someone left on the floor), the duo return to the apartments and Yuno parks his car, meeting up Wingman and his fiance and marveling over the nice color of their car. Deciding that it'd be nice to take Ramee's car to prison so the failed bank robbers have something to get back to town in, Yuno and Guy share a pleasant conversation about prank calls and cars before they arrive at Reuniting with Guy Jones and picking up a random prisoner who's just got out, Yuno and Guy hear about the man's misfortune and his lust for Wrangler's blood. Getting pulled over, the man runs away in hopes of giving the others a distraction, an action that leads to only him getting arrested and Guy and Yuno getting off with a warning. Talking to officers Immediately catching up on what the call is about, Yuno tells the clown that the person who hurt him was Trying to get to Guy Jones' side, Yuno is soon intercepted by Wingman, who is willing to give 500 dollars to Yuno in exchange for a defamatory retwaat in regards to Accepting his friend's hug and wishing him good luck as he is about to go to bed, Yuno watches as Wingman continues running around frantically in an effort to escape from Claire, who successfully catches him after a minute. However, his hopes are not gone as a girl tries to free him, only to get herself chased as well. Taking the opportunity, Yuno goes to his apartment and retrieves some of his spoons from prison, making his way down the elevator and rushing to the Block's side for a clutch rescue and, with the officers chasing after the once again free man, Yuno helps the girl as well. Watching the frenzy from a distance, Yuno is saddened when Wingman falls down a ledge and ends up needing to go to the hospital, putting an end to the hilarious chaos they created. Having a short conversation with Mina and receiving a few stickers from her, and wishing Claire good luck, Yuno decides that he's drained for the day and he needs to rest. Getting back to his apartment, the Vault Buster goes to sleep once more, the promise of cracking the entire Vault hanging over his head. |Starting off his day by dodging a random man who wants his shoes, Yuno drives to the | Back at the Burger Shot, Yuno calls After practicing the jump, they drive up to Arriving at the Grapeseed convenience store, Yuno quickly gets to the little vault and opens it with ease, nervously checking up on it every few seconds as he has no real way of knowing how quickly it'll open. Checking up with his squad when he hears the cops, Yuno takes a nervous glance at the officers and stops himself from talking to them in favor of being more cautious. Disappointed when the safe opens and there are only some bands and no dongle, Yuno decides to split the money when they're in the car, and they drive down the highway back to the city, passing by prison, then by the Casino, and soon they're at the drop-down spot. Getting on their motorcycles and the distraction car, Yuno soon passes by the train tracks and rushes through the canals and tunnels, deciding that at the very least he got information out of the entire ordeal. Cautious about the distant sound of police sirens, Yuno opts to change at the Casino and picks up a stranded Wingman he finds on the street. Explaining what happened to the Block and trying to accept the man's enthusiasm, Yuno changes his clothes and they get back on the bike, with Wingman trying to find a friend of his as Yuno talks with La Flare on the phone to confirm that everyone's okay. Promising to take La Flare to a bank job if there's a free space, Yuno hangs up with the man and lets Wingman narrate his adventure from the previous day, how he stole a truck and drove it around until Tony, Yuno waves Wingman goodbye and promises to take him to a bank if he gets his own dongle, Yuno calls Tony to inform him about the fact that the green dongle is not guaranteed, and that the investment in the trucks might not be worth it if they can't get what they seek every time. Learning that the actual Bobcat truck that sends off emails was in town earlier but no one was there to get it, Yuno agrees to do a couple more experiments on the convenience stores before giving up altogether. Arranging to meet up later during the day, Yuno drives to the apartments to hide the money he got and finds the crew he was just with again. Thanking them for taking him along and trying to raise their moods, Yuno walks up to the elevators and gets stopped by Hiding stuff away and returning to the parking lot, Yuno says hi to Yeager, Fingle Dan, and Ursula before picking up the NBC leader, who's waiting for As they are waiting for everyone to come back from their respective apartment, Yuno receives a call from Tony who is in need of some cash after spending all his clean money on his new car, Tony tells the hacker he in fact has a lot of dirty money but little clean money, Yuno agrees to give him 50k dollars in exchange for an inked bag to help the driver get through until he has a chance to clean his money. After changing into his X outfit, Yuno reunites with the crackheads and they leave to buy the laptop and get a hostage. After asking Guy if he had talked to Olivia and learning that they agreed to exchange dongles so that the NBC could hit Paleto first, the devious hacker decides to prank the woman. As such he calls Olivia pretending that the crew he's with (which is \"definitely\" not the NBC) is insane and will shoot on sight. Yuno then tells Ursula about the job and suddenly realizes that they already have a hostage. Bickering, singing, and talking to their hostage (Birdman), they pick up the laptop and head all the way up to Paleto, where Yuno quickly does his part and hangs around as the others mess around with each other and the hostage. Calling Raymond and informing him of what happened at the 24/7, Yuno hangs up and talks to the officer who's just arrived, Talking about movies and giving the officer a burger (a gesture that makes him chuckle in flustered amusement), the group leave promptly and the chase begins immediately afterwards, one particular cruiser following them with surprising ease, its slic ktop allowing it to go even faster than the group. Yelling playfully at the quick officer and crashing around a little, they arrive at the opening they need and fail to get in with the officers violently pitting them, looping around and finally arriving at the place they need, an officer already chilling by their bikes. With no other ideas in mind, Yuno jumps into the canals in an attempt to detract some attention from his friends and swims around for a coupleof minutes until he reaches a rusty ladder, which he is unable to use. Hearing an officer right behind him, Yuno keeps swimming to the next ladder, quickly making his way up and trying to gently push the officer back into the water as the man comes up, to no avail. Stumbling across Dean's motorcycle, Yuno jumps in and they drive away from the scene for a short while, the elusive Guy Jones trying to describe his location over the phone to the stressed Dean. Once Dean finally understands the instructions, Yuno jumps off the bike and wishes him luck in rescuing their VIP, climbing on top of a rooftop in a desperate attempt at keeping Air-1 on him for as long as possible. The chopper leaves him shortly after, with Yuno being captured as he is trying to take a car. Saddened with the fact that he's going back but hopes that the others can make it, Yuno engages in a pleasant conversation with In prison again, Yuno immediately jogs to the cafeteria to get some spoons and meets up with Peanut, the both of them excited about the fact that the other two seem to have gotten away. With Running towards Guy Jones, Yuno gives the man a Slurpee and they continue catching up about the day's events, then check Dean's car (which Patar borrows) and find Deciding to actually do the \"Crackolympics\" into an event, NBC take Yuno to their warehouse, where they split the cut and discuss plans for the Vault. Returning to the apartments and parting ways with his lovely friends, Yuno calls Tony to tell him that he's ready to give him the loan, then agrees to test the safe rcacking device on the grocery stores with less than 50 minutes until tsunami. Calling Raymond next, Yuno informs the man of the current plans and soon accepts to let Raymond borrow 120k dollars in clean money in exchange for a couple iof oked bags (much like his deal with Tony). Getting his newly acquired loot ready so Raymond can store it in his house, the two wait for Tony to arrive in his new car and talk to Wingman in the meantime, the block introducing them to Driving to Raymond's house to put everything away, the promise of almost 400k in dirty money giving him peace of heart. Getting a car and an Akuma, and picking up a random hostage ( With fifteen minutes to spare, Yuno shyly asks for Tony's permission to play around with his car and the masterful driver teaches him how to use the vehicle, letting him experiment with NOS and instructing him on how to do one of Tony Corleone's trademark 360 spins. Struggling for a bit, and crashing quite a few times, Yuno eventually manages to get the technique mostly done and soon he's spinning around gleefully, arriving at a gas station to refuel the vehicle and driving calmly down the highway together as another crazy day comes to an end. |(| |(| Part 7: Darkness and Progress[ ] |With his experience in Block City being reduced to several set backs and lonely days as most of his friends didn't enjoy the place as much as anticipated, Yuno devotes himself to the city anew much to the happiness of his beloved friends.

Blowing up the Vinewood power station and making his way inside the right wing of the Vault, Yuno comes face to face with the golden laptop hack, and is shocked to discover how simple it is. However, the Cleanbois encounter yet another obstacle as there is more to the puzzle they have to figure out, a computer requiring a USB catching their attention before they leave and discuss their next steps. | | |With his trip to Block city delayed for unforeseen situations and following the events of the previous day, Yuno wakes up in his apartment and sorts through his storage to get ready for the day, soon realizing that his possessions are still in prison and in need of picking up.

Aware of his impostor and telling the people to get rid of the man, Yuno makes his merry way to | Parking his car right behind Raymond's and asking for insight from some police officers, Yuno engages in a short but pleasant conversation with Walking up to his friends and quickly greeting Arriving at the closed burger shop, Yuno encounters Ash and a mysterious couple hanging out. Asking her about it, Yuno soon learns that the people she's with are part of some cult and she's concerned about whether or not she'll see Benji again, which leads Yuno to text her his ping in case she needs it. Reuniting with the inblocknito Wingman at the courthouse, Yuno quickly does the man a favor and checks if he has a warrant and, unsurprisingly, discovers that yes, he does. Watching as Wingman removes his mask (revealing a decent looking bloke) so that he'd be unrecognizable and questioning the blocky man as to how he managed to get processed wearing his mask, the two return to the courtroom and listen to the closing statements, both of them getting bored in less than thirty seconds. With the statements over and the judge withdrawing to deliberate and decide on a ruling, the officers within the room quickly spot Wingman and Yuno's friend flees for his freedom, running outside as quickly as possible. Following behind him and watching as Wrangler and his lawyer beat up Mr. Lang, Yuno makes a quick stop outside to check on the Block and stumbles across a confused Kneeling beside the injured Lang, Yuno shares a heart-to-heart conversation with his beloved friend and promises that he won't leave him behind. Reminiscing about his relationship with the millionaire, Yuno and Lang talk about basketball and bond with Ray Mond about their exasperation, then talk about Block city and how Lang wants to visit soon. Making amends with Summer and discussing their first encounter for the first time, as well as the possibility of doing a bank together and the fact that he's still in the look for Talking with more people as they eagerly wait for the verdict, spotting Bored out of his wits, Yuno continues running around and makes his way to the witness stand, where Summer and Stanton intercept him and begin to mock-interrogate him about the events of the previous day, their little bonding session interrupted by the judge's return. Sitting with Leyla and his friends, Yuno listens to the verdict and becomes shocked by how brutal the judge's words are as she slowly tears Raymond, Ray Mond, and their lawyer, Walking out with the tired Lang, Yuno soon spots a black sultan occupied by four figures dressed exactly like X. Approaching them with caution, Yuno learns that they call themselves Approaching Leyla by the site of the incident, Yuno talks about what happened with her and discovers that everyone at the scene remembers a white sedan driving by, the fact that they all got the color wrong (intentionally or not) as amusing to the hacker as it is to Leyla and he is quick to relay the information to officer Driving around with the sweet major, Yuno learns that she's stepping down because of the stress, then realizes that her head popped along the way. Parking in the hospital regardless, Yuno finds that there are no doctors at Finally meeting the copycat, Yuno marvels at how despite their similar appearances, Noyu's personality and charm with the ladies make him in fact the opposite of the lovable hacker. Knowing Noyu's attempts at impersonating him Yuno decides to create some chaos by giving the copycat tips on how to imitate his mannerisms before running to the Burger Shot to change back into his regular outfit. Running into a bunch of his co-workers Yuno attempts to imitate Noyu's voice, immediately being questioned by As Yuno was about to leave he runs into Through all their shenanigans Jimmy ends up getting knocked out and has to be taken to the hospital, as such Noyu, Yuno, and a bunch of their fellow coworkers pile up in the hacker's car, speeding off to to the hospital. As they are getting Jimmy checked in Yuno stumbles on Noyu as he is in the process of flirting with a confused Kitty, the flustered hacker tries his best to make clear he is in fact not flirting with Raymond's girlfriend. Eventually finding out unlike the real Yuno, Noyu has eyebrows and a comical mustache, when the man removes his helmet to further convince Kitty she is in fact beautiful. At the parking lot, the group runs into Raymond, who is quick to pinpoint the real Yuno to the onlookers' surprise. As they are soon joined by the rest of the clones, Yuno attempts to fool his friend by mixing up with them, asking the Russian to try and find which one is the real Yuno. To the hacker's surprise, Raymond rises up to the challenge, pointing at his friend without any hesitation. Saying goodbye to his friend as he is about to go to bed, the group soon heads back to the Burger Shot to continue with the clone's shenanigans. On their way back Yuno calls As the trooper pulls up he is faced with the task of catching the impostor, after submitting the trio to a series of tests Hunter declares Yuno to be the copycat much to the hacker's surprise, tasing him and putting him in handcuffs. While being dragged to the officer's cruiser Yuno tried to plead his case, convincing the trooper to make the fake Yuno's remove their helmet as the hacker is now known for his lack of eyebrows. Despite this revelation Noyu claimed to be the real Yuno, explaining he just used a marker to draw on eyebrows and showing Yuno's ID to prove he is in fact the real Yuno. Without further ado, the trooper throws Yuno in his car, taking him away to presumably put him in jail.

Talking with Lang about what to do with the golden dongle, the two Cleanbois agree to talk to the crackheads about it if they get it and ask to keep it, rolling a dice in the event that the others want it. With that agreement complete, Yuno heads upstairs and tells Dean and Guy that they are doing good and need to wait five minutes, then talks to With the chase starting as soon as they enter their car, Yuno quickly realizes that Air-1 is not around at the moment and there's few cruisers on them, giving them an advantage for their first couple switches. Driving to the squeeze and finding two random trucks suspiciously parked in front of the entrance, Guy Jones manages to hyper-squeeze through the gap and soon they are inside their second car, a little bit of Yuno's blood left behind as the hacker trips in the process. With Air-1 finally making an appearance (but not having time to check ahead for their next steps), the group makes their way to the boat and swiftly gets in. However, as they're sitting, Dean gets tazed off into the water and he struggles to get back in.

Confusing the officers with his innocent voice and convincing them to check the truck to see that he didn't take anything, Yuno tries his best to convince the officers to charge him exclusively with joyriding, as they don't have evidence of robbery on his side. As the officers speak further, however, Yuno realizes that the reason they were hesitant to approach him in the beginning, and the reason they go so hard on all the trucks, is that the officers believe that the criminals are taking the trucks to secluded areas to prepare for a shoot-out.
