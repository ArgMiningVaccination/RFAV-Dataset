Moreover, atthe 65th meeting of the World Health Assembly(WHA) in May 2012, India, Switzerland, and theUnited States cosponsored a resolution requestingthat the World Health Organization, in collaborationwith member countries, develop a global mentalhealth action plan. This resolution was passed at the66th WHA in May 2013. By their support of this reso-lution, member countries have expressed their com-mitment for \"promotion of mental health, preventionof mental disorders, and early identification, care,support, treatment, and recovery of persons withmental disorders.\" With the passage of this resolution,mental health services may now be available for mil-lions who have been without this type of care. Many nurse leaders see this period of mental health- care reform as an opportunity for nurses to expandtheir roles and assume key positions in education, pre-vention, assessment, and referral. Nurses are, and willcontinue to be, in key positions to assist individuals toattain, maintain, or regain optimal emotional wellness. As it has been with each new edition of Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing: Concepts of Care in Evidence-Based Nursing , the goal of this eighth edition is to bring to practicing nurses and nursing students themost up-to-date information related to neurobiology,psychopharmacology, and evidence-based nursing interventions. Notable in this edition are changes as-sociated with the recently-published fifth edition ofthe American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic andStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) . Content and Features New to the Eighth Edition All content has been updated to reflect the current state of the discipline of nursing. All psychiatric diagnostic content is reflective of the newly published American Psychiatric Associa-tion's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (2013). All nursing diagnoses are current with the NANDA-I 2012-2014 Nursing Diagnoses Definitions and Classifications. Six \"Communication Exercises\" boxes\u2014one each following the chapters on Neurocognitive Disorders,Substance Use and Addictive Disorders, Schizophrenia,Depressive Disorders, Personality Disorders, and Sur-vivors of Abuse or Neglect. These exercises portray clin-ical scenarios that allow the student to practicecommunication skills with clients. Examples of answersappear in an appendix at the back of the book. New content on factitious disorder, Munchausen syndrome, and hoarding disorder. New chapter on \"Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\" (to correlate with DSM-5). \"Military Families.\"New chapter on \"The Recovery Model\" in the Therapeutic Approaches unit of the textbook. Addi-tional content on the Recovery Model in chapters onSchizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder. Updated and new psychotropic drugs approved since the publication of the seventh edition. Theseare included in the specific diagnostic chapters towhich they apply and in the psychopharmacologychapter found on davisplus.com. Features That Have Been Retained in the Eighth Edition The concept of holistic nursing is retained in the eighth edition. An attempt has been made to ensurethat the physical aspects of psychiatric/mental healthnursing are not overlooked. In all relevant situations,the mind/body connection is addressed. Nursing process is retained in the eighth edition as the tool for delivery of care to the individual with apsychiatric disorder or to assist in the primary preven-tion or exacerbation of mental illness symptoms. Thesix steps of the nursing process, as described in theAmerican Nurses Association Standards of Clinical Nurs-ing Practice, are used to provide guidelines for the nurse. These standards of care are included for the DSM-5 diagnoses, as well as those on the aging individual, thebereaved individual, survivors of abuse and neglect, and military families, and as examples in several of thetherapeutic approaches. The six steps include: Assessment: Background assessment data, including a description of symptomatology, provides an ex- tensive knowledge base from which the nurse maydraw when performing an assessment. Several as-sessment tools are also included. Diagnosis: Analysis of the data is included, from which nursing diagnoses common to specific psy-chiatric disorders are derived. 4092_FM_i-xxiv 25/07/14 10:20 AM Page xxiiiOutcome Identification: Outcomes are derived from the nursing diagnoses and stated as measurable goals. Planning: A plan of care is presented with selected nurs- ing diagnoses for the DSM-5 diagnoses, as well as for the elderly client, the bereaved individual, victims of abuse and neglect, military veterans and their fami-lies, the elderly homebound client, and the primarycaregiver of the client with a chronic mental illness.The planning standard also includes tables that listtopics for educating clients and families about mentalillness. Concept map care plans are included for allmajor psychiatric diagnoses. Implementation: The interventions that have been identified in the plan of care are included alongwith rationales for each. Case studies at the end ofeach DSM-5 chapter assist the student in the practi- cal application of theoretical material. Also includedas a part of this particular standard is Unit 3 of thetextbook, \"Therapeutic Approaches in PsychiatricNursing Care. \" This section of the textbook ad- dresses psychiatric nursing intervention in depth,and frequently speaks to the differentiation in scopeof practice between the basic level psychiatric nurseand the advanced practice level psychiatric nurse. Evaluation: The evaluation standard includes a set of questions that the nurse may use to assess whetherthe nursing actions have been successful in achiev-ing the objectives of care. Other features of this eighth edition: Internet references for each DSM-5 diagnosis, with website listings for information related to the disorder. Tables that list topics for client/family education(in the clinical chapters). Boxes that include current research studies with implications for evidence-based nursing practice(in the clinical chapters). Assigning nursing diagnoses to client behaviors (diagnostic chapters and Appendix F). Taxonomy and diagnostic criteria from the DSM-5 (2013) . Used throughout the text. All references have been updated throughout thetext. Classical references are distinguished from general references. Boxes with definitions of core concepts appear throughout the text. Comprehensive glossary. Answers to end-of-chapter review questions (Appendix A). Answers to communication exercises (Appendix B). Sample client teaching guides (online at www.davisplus.com). Website. An F.A. Davis/Townsend website that con- tains additional nursing care plans that do not ap-pear in the text, links to psychotropic medications,concept map care plans, and neurobiological content and illustrations, as well as student re-sources including practice test questions, learningactivities, concept map care plans, and client teach-ing guides. Additional Educational Resources Faculty may also find the following teaching aids thataccompany this textbook helpful: Instructor Resources at www.davisplus.com: Multiple choice questions (including new format questions reflecting the latest NCLEX blueprint).

It is hoped that the revisions and additions to this eighth edition continue to satisfy a need within psy-chiatric/mental health nursing practice. The missionof this textbook has been, and continues to be, to pro-vide both students and clinicians with up-to-date infor-mation about psychiatric/mental health nursing.

This term is used loosely today and still lacks a defini-tive explanation. Stress may be viewed as an individual'sreaction to any change that requires an adjustment orresponse, which can be physical, mental, or emotional.Responses directed at stabilizing internal biologicalprocesses and preserving self-esteem can be viewed ashealthy adaptations to stress. Roy (1976) defined an adaptive response as behav- ior that maintains the integrity of the individual.Adaptation is viewed as positive and is correlated witha healthy response. When behavior disrupts the in-tegrity of the individual, it is perceived as maladaptive.4092_Ch01_001-011 23/07/14 11:41 AM Page 2CHAPTER 1 The Concept of Stress Adaptation 3 Maladaptive responses by the individual are consid- ered to be negative or unhealthy. Various 20th-century researchers contributed to several different concepts of stress. Three of these con-cepts include stress as a biological response, stress asan environmental event, and stress as a transaction be-tween the individual and the environment. This chap-ter includes an explanation of each of these concepts. Stress as a Biological Response In 1956, Hans Selye published the results of his re-search concerning the physiological response of a biological system to a change imposed on it. Since hisinitial publication, he has revised his definition ofstress, calling it \"the state manifested by a specific syn-drome which consists of all the nonspecifically-induced changes within a biologic system\" (Selye,1976). This syndrome of symptoms has come to beknown as the \" fight or flight\" syndrome . Schematics of these biological responses, both initially and withsustained stress, are presented in Figures 1-1 and 1-2.Selye called this general reaction of the body to stressthe general adaptation syndrome. He described three distinct stages of the reaction: 1. Alarm Reaction Stage. During this stage, the phys- iological responses of the \"fight or flight\" syn-drome are initiated. 2. Stage of Resistance. The individual uses the phys- iological responses of the first stage as a defense inthe attempt to adapt to the stressor . If adaptation occurs, the third stage is prevented or delayed.Physiological symptoms may disappear.CORE CONCEPT Stressor A biological, psychological, social, or chemical factor that causes physical or emotional tension and may bea factor in the etiology of certain illnesses.

This stage occurs when there is a prolonged exposure to the stressor to which the body has become adjusted. The adaptive en-ergy is depleted, and the individual can no longerdraw from the resources for adaptation describedin the first two stages. Diseases of adaptation (e.g.,headaches, mental disorders, coronary arter y dis- ease, ulcers, colitis) may occur. Without interven-tion for reversal, exhaustion, and in some caseseven death, ensues (Selye, 1956, 1974). This \"fight or flight\" response undoubtedly served our ancestors well. Those Homo sapiens who had to face the giant grizzly bear or the saber-toothed tiger as partof their struggle for survival must have used theseadaptive resources to their advantage. The responsewas elicited in emergency situations, used in thepreservation of life, and followed by restoration of thecompensatory mechanisms to the pre-emergent con-dition (homeostasis). Selye performed his extensive research in a con- trolled setting with laboratory animals as subjects.He elicited the physiological responses with physicalstimuli, such as exposure to heat or extreme cold,electric shock, injection of toxic agents, restraint,and surgical injury. Since the publication of his orig-inal research, it has become apparent that the \"fightor flight\" syndrome of symptoms occurs in responseto psychological or emotional stimuli, just as it doesto physical stimuli. The psychological or emotionalstressors are often not resolved as rapidly as somephysical stressors, and therefore the body may be de-pleted of its adaptive energy more readily than it isfrom physical stressors. The \"fight or flight\" re-sponse may be inappropriate, even dangerous, to4 UNIT 1 Basic Concepts in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing FIGURE 1-2 The \"fight Sex hormones; Later, with sustained stress:Secretion of sex hormonesDirect effect on protein, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, resulting in increased serum glucose and vesselsFluid retention LibidoImpotence4092_Ch01_001-011 23/07/14 11:41 AM Page 4the lifestyle of today, in which stress has been de- scribed as a psychosocial state that is pervasive,chronic, and relentless. It is this chronic responsethat maintains the body in the aroused condition forextended periods of time that promotes susceptibil-ity to diseases of adaptation.CHAPTER 1 The Concept of Stress Adaptation 5 Miller and Rahe (1997) have updated the original Social Readjustment Rating Scale devised by Holmesand Rahe in 1967. Just as in the earlier version, numer-ical values are assigned to various events, or changes,that are common in people's lives. The updated versionreflects an increased number of stressors not identifiedin the original version. In the new study, Miller andRahe found that women react to life stress events athigher levels than men, and unmarried people gavehigher scores than married people for most of theevents. Younger subjects rated more events at a higherstress level than older subjects. A high score on the Re-cent Life Changes Questionnaire (RLCQ) places theindividual at greater susceptibility to physical or psy-chological illness. The questionnaire may be com-pleted considering life stressors within a 6-month or1-year period. Six-month totals equal to or greater than300 life change units (LCUs) or 1-year totals equal toor greater than 500 LCUs are considered indicative ofa high level of recent life stress, thereby increasing therisk of illness for the individual. The RLCQ is pre-sented in Table 1-1. It is unknown whether stress overload merely predisposes a person to illness or actually precipi-tates it, but there does appear to be a causal link(Pelletier, 1992). Life changes questionnaires havebeen criticized because they do not consider the in-dividual's perception of the event. Individuals differ Stress as an Environmental Event A second concept defines stress as the \"thing\" or\"event\" that triggers the adaptive physiological andpsychological responses in an individual. The eventcreates change in the life pattern of the individual,requires significant adjustment in lifestyle, and taxesavailable personal resources. The change can be ei-ther positive, such as outstanding personal achieve-ment, or negative, such as being fired from a job. Theemphasis here is on change from the existing steady state of the individual's life pattern.CORE CONCEPT Adaptation Adaptation is said to occur when an individual's physical or behavioral response to any change in his or her internal or external environment results in preservationof individual integrity or timely return to equilibrium.

These types of instruments alsofail to consider the individual's coping strategiesand available support systems at the time when thelife change occurs. Positive coping mechanisms andstrong social or familial support can reduce the in-tensity of the stressful life change and promote amore adaptive response. Stress as a Transaction Between the Individual and the Environment This concept of stress emphasizes the relationship be- tween the individual and the environment. Personalcharacteristics and the nature of the environmentalevent are considered. This illustration parallels themodern concept of the etiology of disease. No longeris causation viewed solely as an external entity;whether or not illness occurs depends also on the re-ceiving organism's susceptibility. Similarly, to predictpsychological stress as a reaction, the properties ofthe person in relation to the environment must beconsidered. Precipitating Event Lazarus and Folkman (1984) define stress as a relation- ship between the person and the environment that isappraised by the person as taxing or exceeding his orher resources and endangering his or her well-being.A precipitating event is a stimulus arising from the in- ternal or external environment and is perceived bythe individual in a specific manner. Determinationthat a particular person-environment relationship isstressful depends on the individual's cognitive ap-praisal of the situation. Cognitive appraisal is an indi- vidual's evaluation of the personal significance of theevent or occurrence. The event \"precipitates\" a re-sponse on the part of the individual, and the responseis influenced by the individual's perception of theevent. The cognitive response consists of a primary ap- praisal and a secondary appraisal. Individual's Perception of the Event Primary Appraisal Lazarus and Folkman (1984) identify three types ofprimary appraisal: irrelevant, benign-positive, andstressful. An event is judged irrelevant when the out- come holds no significance for the individual. A benign-positive outcome is one that is perceived as pro- ducing pleasure for the individual. Stress appraisals in- clude harm/loss, threat, and challenge. Harm/ loss appraisals refer to damage or loss already experi-enced by the individual. Appraisals of a threatening na- ture are perceived as anticipated harms or losses.When an event is appraised as challenging, the individ- ual focuses on potential for gain or growth, ratherthan on risks associated with the event. Challengeproduces stress even though the emotions associatedwith it (eagerness and excitement) are viewed as pos-itive, and coping mechanisms must be called upon toface the new encounter. Challenge and threat mayoccur together when an individual experiences thesepositive emotions along with fear or anxiety over pos-sible risks associated with the challenging event. When stress is produced in response to harm/loss, threat, or challenge, a secondary appraisal is made bythe individual. Secondary Appraisal This secondary appraisal is an assessment of skills, re-sources, and knowledge that the person possesses todeal with the situation. The individual evaluates byconsidering the following: Which coping strategies are available to me? Will the option I choose be effective in this situation? Do I have the ability to use that strategy in an effec-tive manner? The interaction between the primary appraisal of the event that has occurred and the secondary ap-praisal of available coping strategies determines thequality of the individual's adaptation response to stress. Predisposing Factors A variety of elements influence how an individual per-ceives and responds to a stressful event. These predis- posing factors strongly influence whether the response is adaptive or maladaptive. Types of predisposing fac-tors include genetic influences, past experiences, andexisting conditions. Genetic influences are those circumstances of an indi- vidual's life that are acquired through heredity. Exam-ples include family history of physical and psychologicalconditions (strengths and weaknesses) and tempera-ment (behavioral characteristics present at birth thatevolve with development). Past experiences are occurrences that result in learned patterns that can influence an individual'sadaptation response. They include previous expo-sure to the stressor or other stressors, learned copingresponses, and degree of adaptation to previousstressors. Existing conditions incorporate vulnerabilities that influence the adequacy of the individual's physical,psychological, and social resources for dealing withadaptive demands. Examples include current healthstatus, motivation, developmental maturity, severityand duration of the stressor, financial and educa-tional resources, age, existing coping strategies, anda support system of caring others.CHAPTER 1 The Concept of Stress Adaptation 74092_Ch01_001-011 23/07/14 11:41 AM Page 7This transactional model of stress/adaptation will serve as a framework for the process of nursing in this text. A graphic display of the model is presented inFigure 1-3.Coping strategies are considered maladaptive when the conflict being experienced goes unresolved or in-tensifies. Energy resources become depleted as thebody struggles to compensate for the chronic physio-logical and psychological arousal being experienced. The effect is a significant vulnerability to physical or psychological illness. Adaptive Coping Strategies Awareness The initial step in managing stress is awareness\u2014tobecome aware of the factors that create stress and thefeelings associated with a stressful response. Stress canbe controlled only when one recognizes that it isbeing experienced. As one becomes aware of stres-sors, he or she can omit, avoid, or accept them. Relaxation Individuals experience relaxation in different ways.Some individuals relax by engaging in large motor ac-tivities, such as sports, jogging, and physical exercise.Still others use techniques such as breathing exercisesand progressive relaxation to relieve stress. (A discus-sion of relaxation therapy may be found online atwww.DavisPlus.com. Meditation Practiced 20 minutes once or twice daily, meditationhas been shown to produce a lasting reduction inblood pressure and other stress-related symptoms(Davis, Eshelman, & McKay, 2008). Meditation in-volves assuming a comfortable position, closing theeyes, casting off all other thoughts, and concentratingon a single word, sound, or phrase that has positivemeaning to the individual. The technique is de-scribed in detail online at www.DavisPlus.com. Interpersonal Communication With Caring Other As previously mentioned, the strength of one's availablesupport systems is an existing condition that signifi-cantly influences the adaptability of coping with stress.Sometimes just \"talking the problem out\" with an indi-vidual who is empathetic is sufficient to interrupt esca-lation of the stress response. Writing about one'sfeelings in a journal or diary can also be therapeutic. Problem Solving An extremely adaptive coping strategy is to view the sit-uation objectively (or to seek assistance from anotherindividual to accomplish this if the anxiety level is toohigh to concentrate). After an objective assessment ofthe situation, the problem-solving/decision-makingmodel can be instituted as follows: Assess the facts of the situation. Formulate goals for resolution of the stressful situation.8 UNIT 1 Basic Concepts in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing Precipitating Event Predisposing Factors Genetic Influences Past Experiences Existing Conditions Cognitive Appraisal * Primary * Irrelevant NoresponseBenign-positive PleasurableresponseStress appraisals Harm/lossThreatChallenge * Secondary * Availability of coping strategiesPerceived effectiveness of coping strategiesPerceived ability to use coping strategies effectively Quality of Response Adaptive MaladaptiveStress Management* The growth of stress management into a multimillion- dollar-a-year business attests to its importance in oursociety. Stress management involves the use of copingstrategies in response to stressful situations. Copingstrategies are adaptive when they protect the individualfrom harm (or additional harm) or strengthen the in-dividual's ability to meet challenging situations. Adap-tive responses help restore homeostasis to the bodyand impede the development of diseases of adaptation.CORE CONCEPT Maladaptation Maladaptation occurs when an individual's physical or behavioral response to any change in his or her internalor external environment results in disruption of individualintegrity or in persistent disequilibrium. *Techniques of stress management are discussed at greater length in Unit 3 of this text.FIGURE 1-3 Transactional model of stress/adaptation.4092_Ch01_001-011 23/07/14 11:41 AM Page 8Study the alternatives for dealing with the situation. Determine the risks and benefits of each alternative. Select an alternative. Implement the alternative selected. Evaluate the outcome of the alternative implemented. If the first choice is ineffective, select and imple-ment a second option. Pets Studies show that those who care for pets, especiallydogs and cats, are better able to cope with the stressorsof life (Allen, Blascovich, & Mendes, 2002; Barker,Knisely, McCain, & Best, 2005). The physical act ofstroking or petting a dog or cat can be therapeutic. Itgives the animal an intuitive sense of being cared forand at the same time gives the individual the calmingfeeling of warmth, affection, and interdependencewith a reliable, trusting being. One study showed thatamong people who had had heart attacks, pet ownershad one-fifth the death rate of those who did not havepets (Friedmann & Thomas, 1995). Another study re-vealed evidence that individuals experienced a statis-tically significant drop in blood pressure in responseto petting a dog or cat (Whitaker, 2000). Music It is true that music can \"soothe the savage beast.\"Creating and listening to music stimulate motivation,enjoyment, and relaxation. Music can reduce depres-sion and bring about measurable changes in moodand general activity. Summary and Key Points Stress has become a chronic and pervasive condi-tion in the United States today. Adaptive behavior is viewed as behavior that main-tains the integrity of the individual, with a timelyreturn to equilibrium. It is viewed as positive andis correlated with a healthy response. When behavior disrupts the integrity of the indi-vidual or results in persistent disequilibrium, it isperceived as maladaptive. Maladaptive responsesby the individual are considered to be negative orunhealthy. A stressor is defined as a biological, psychological,social, or chemical factor that causes physical oremotional tension and may be a factor in the etiol-ogy of certain illnesses. Hans Selye identified the biological changes asso-ciated with a stressful situation as the \"fight orflight\" syndrome.Selye called the general reaction of the body tostress the \"general adaptation syndrome,\" whichoccurs in three stages: the alarm reaction stage, thestage of resistance, and the stage of exhaustion. When individuals remain in the aroused responseto stress for an extended period of time, they be-come susceptible to diseases of adaptation, someexamples of which include headaches, mentaldisorders, coronary artery disease, ulcers, and colitis. Stress may also be viewed as an environmentalevent. This results when a change from the existingsteady state of the individual's life pattern occurs. When an individual experiences a high level of lifechange events, he or she becomes susceptible tophysical or psychological illness. Limitations of the environmental concept of stressinclude failure to consider the individual's percep-tion of the event, coping strategies, and availablesupport systems at the time when the life changeoccurs. Stress is more appropriately expressed as a transac-tion between the individual and the environmentthat is appraised by the individual as taxing or ex-ceeding his or her resources and endangering hisor her well-being. The individual makes a cognitive appraisal of theprecipitating event to determine the personal sig-nificance of the event or occurrence. Primary cognitive appraisals may be irrelevant, benign-positive, or stressful. Secondary cognitive appraisals include assessmentand evaluation by the individual of skills, re-sources, and knowledge to deal with the stressfulsituation. Predisposing factors influence how an individualperceives and responds to a stressful event. Theyinclude genetic influences, past experiences, andexisting conditions. Stress management involves the use of adaptivecoping strategies in response to stressful situationsin an effort to impede the development of diseasesof adaptation. Examples of adaptive coping strategies include de-veloping awareness, relaxation, meditation, interper-sonal communication with caring other, problemsolving, pets, and music.CHAPTER 1 The Concept of Stress Adaptation 9 Additional info available at www.davisplus.com4092_Ch01_001-011 23/07/14 11:41 AM Page 910 UNIT 1 Basic Concepts in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for questions 1 through 5.

This chapter deals with the evolution of psychiatric care from ancient times to the present. Mental health and mental illness are defined, and the psychological adaptation to stress is explained in terms of the twomajor responses: anxiety and grief. Behavioral re-sponses and their placement along the mental health/mental illness continuum are discussed. Historical Overview of Psychiatric Care Primitive beliefs regarding mental disturbances tookseveral views. Some thought that an individual withmental illness had been dispossessed of his or her souland that the only way wellness could be achieved wasif the soul returned. Others believed that evil spiritsor supernatural or magical powers had entered thebody. The \"cure\" for these individuals involved a ritu-alistic exorcism to purge the body of these unwantedforces. This often consisted of brutal beatings, starva-tion, or other torturous means. Still others consideredthat the individual with mental illness may have bro-ken a taboo or sinned against another individual orGod, for which ritualistic purification was required orvarious types of retribution were demanded. The cor-relation of mental illness to demonology or witchcraftled to some individuals with mental illness beingburned at the stake. The position of these ancient beliefs evolved with in- creasing knowledge about mental illness and changesin cultural, religious, and sociopolitical attitudes. Thework of Hippocrates, about 400 B.C., began the move- ment away from belief in the supernatural. Hippocratesassociated insanity and mental illness with an irregular-ity in the interaction of the four body fluids\u2014blood,black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm. He called thesebody fluids humors, and associated each with a partic-ular disposition. Disequilibrium among these four hu-mors was thought to cause mental illness, and it wasoften treated by inducing vomiting and diarrhea withpotent cathartic drugs. During the Middle Ages ( A.D. 500 to 1500), the as- sociation of mental illness with witchcraft and the su-pernatural continued to prevail in Europe. Duringthis period, many people with severe mental illnesswere sent out to sea on sailing boats with little guid-ance to search for their lost rationality. The expres-sion \"ship of fools\" was derived from this operation. During the same period in the Middle Eastern Is- lamic countries, however, a change in attitudebegan to occur, from the perception of mental ill-ness as the result of witchcraft or the supernaturalto the idea that these individuals were actually ill.This notion gave rise to the establishment of specialunits for clients with mental illness within generalhospitals, as well as residential institutions specifi-cally designed for this purpose. They can likely beconsidered the first asylums for individuals withmental illness. Colonial Americans tended to reflect the attitudes of the European communities from which they hademigrated. Particularly in the New England area, in-dividuals were punished for behavior attributed towitchcraft. In the 16th and 17th centuries, institutionsfor people with mental illness did not exist in theUnited States, and care of these individuals became afamily responsibility. Those without family or otherresources became the responsibility of the communi-ties in which they lived and were incarcerated inplaces where they could do no harm to themselves orothers. The first hospital in America to admit clients with mental illness was established in Philadelphia in themiddle of the 18th century. Benjamin Rush, oftencalled the father of American psychiatry, was a physi-cian at the hospital. He initiated the provision of hu-manistic treatment and care for clients with mentalillness. Although he included kindness, exercise, andsocialization, he also employed harsher methods suchas bloodletting, purging, various types of physical re-straints, and extremes of temperatures, reflecting themedical therapies of that era. The 19th century brought the establishment of a system of state asylums, largely the result of the workof Dorothea Dix, a former New England school-teacher, who lobbied tirelessly on behalf of the men-tally ill population. She was unfaltering in her beliefthat mental illness was curable and that state hospi-tals should provide humanistic therapeutic care.This system of hospital care for individuals withmental illness grew, but the mentally ill populationgrew faster. The institutions became overcrowdedand understaffed, and conditions deteriorated.Therapeutic care reverted to custodial care. Thesestate hospitals provided the largest resource for in-dividuals with mental illness until the initiation ofthe community health movement of the 1960s (seeChapter 36). The emergence of psychiatric nursing began in 1873 with the graduation of Linda Richards fromthe nursing program at the New England Hospitalfor Women and Children in Boston. She has cometo be known as the first American psychiatric nurse.During her career, Richards was instrumental inthe establishment of a number of psychiatric hos-pitals and the first school of psychiatric nursing atthe McLean Asylum in Waverly, Massachusetts, in4092_Ch02_012-026 24/07/14 5:20 PM Page 131882. The focus in this school, and those that fol- lowed, was \"training\" in how to provide custodialcare for clients in psychiatric asylums\u2014trainingthat did not include the study of psychological con-cepts. Significant change did not occur until 1955,when incorporation of psychiatric nursing intotheir curricula became a requirement for all under-graduate schools of nursing. Nursing curricula emphasized the importance of the nurse-patient relationship and therapeuticcommunication techniques. Nursing interventionin the somatic therapies (e.g., insulin and electro-convulsive therapy) provided impetus for the incor-poration of these concepts into nursing's body ofknowledge. With the apparently increasing need for psychi- atric care in the aftermath of World War II, the gov-ernment passed the National Mental Health Act of1946. This legislation provided funds for the educa-tion of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, andpsychiatric nurses. Graduate-level education in psy-chiatric nursing was established during this period.Also significant at this time was the introduction ofantipsychotic medications, which made it possible forpsychotic clients to more readily participate in theirtreatment, including nursing therapies. Knowledge of the history of psychiatric/mental health care contributes to the understanding of theconcepts presented in this chapter and those inChapter 3, which describe the theories of personalitydevelopment according to various 19th-century and20th-century leaders in the psychiatric/mental healthmovement. Modern American psychiatric care has itsroots in ancient times. A great deal of opportunityexists for continued advancement of this specialtywithin the practice of nursing. Mental Health A number of theorists have attempted to define theconcept of mental health. Many of these conceptsdeal with various aspects of individual functioning.Maslow (1970) emphasized an individual's motivationin the continuous quest for self-actualization. Heidentified a \"hierarchy of needs,\" the lower ones re-quiring fulfillment before those at higher levels canbe achieved, with self-actualization being fulfillmentof one's highest potential. An individual's positionwithin the hierarchy may reverse from a higher levelto a lower level based on life circumstances. For ex-ample, an individual facing major surgery who hasbeen working on tasks to achieve self-actualizationmay become preoccupied, if only temporarily, withthe need for physiological safety. A representation ofthis needs hierarchy is presented in Figure 2-1.Maslow described self-actualization as being \"psy- chologically healthy, fully human, highly evolved,and fully mature.\" He believed that \"healthy,\" or\"self-actualized,\" individuals possessed the followingcharacteristics: An appropriate perception of reality The ability to accept oneself, others, and humannature The ability to manifest spontaneity The capacity for focusing concentration on prob-lem solving A need for detachment and desire for privacy Independence, autonomy, and a resistance to enculturation An intensity of emotional reaction A frequency of \"peak\" experiences that vali-dates the worthwhileness, richness, and beautyof life An identification with humankind The ability to achieve satisfactory interpersonal relationships A democratic character structure and strong senseof ethics Creativeness A degree of nonconformance Jahoda (1958) identified a list of six indicators that she suggested are a reflection of mental health: 1. A Positive Attitude Toward Self. This includes an objective view of self, including knowledge and ac-ceptance of strengths and limitations. The individ-ual feels a strong sense of personal identity and asecurity within the environment. 2. Growth, Development, and the Ability to Achieve Self-actualization. This indicator correlates with whether the individual successfully achieves the tasks associated with each level of develop-ment (see Erikson, Chapter 3). With successfulachievement in each level, the individual gainsmotivation for advancement to his or her highestpotential. 3 . Integration. The focus here is on maintaining an equilibrium or balance among various life processes.Integration includes the ability to adaptively respondto the environment and the development of a phi-losophy of life, both of which help the individualmaintain anxiety at a manageable level in responseto stressful situations. 4. Autonomy. This refers to the individual's ability to perform in an independent, self-directed manner . The individual makes choices and accepts respon-sibility for the outcomes. 5. Perception of Reality. Accurate reality percep- tion is a positive indicator of mental health. Thisincludes perception of the environment without14 UNIT 1 Basic Concepts in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing4092_Ch02_012-026 24/07/14 5:20 PM Page 14distortion, as well as the capacity for empathy and social sensitivity\u2014a respect and concern forthe wants and needs of others. 6. Environmental Mastery. This indicator suggests that the individual has achieved a satisfactory role within the group, society, or environment. It sug-gests that he or she is able to love and accept thelove of others. When faced with life situations, theindividual is able to strategize, make decisions,change, adjust, and adapt. Life offers satisfactionto the individual who has achieved environmentalmastery. Black and Andreasen (2011) define mental health as: a state of being that is relative rather than absolute. The successful performance of mental functionsshown by productive activities, fulfilling relationshipswith other people, and the ability to adapt to changeand to cope with adversity. (p. 608)CHAPTER 2 Mental Health/Mental Illness: Historical and Theoretical Concepts 15 Robinson (1983) has offered the following defini- tion of mental health: a dynamic state in which thought, feeling, and behav-ior that is age-appropriate and congruent with thelocal and cultural norms is demonstrated. (p. 74) For purposes of this text, and in keeping with the framework of stress/adaptation, a modification of Robinson's definition of mental health is considered.Thus, mental health is viewed as \"the successful adap- tation to stressors from the internal or external envi-ronment, evidenced by thoughts, feelings, andbehaviors that are age-appropriate and congruentwith local and cultural norms.\" Mental Illness A universal concept of mental illness is difficult, be-cause of the cultural factors that influence such a def-inition. However, certain elements are associated with(The individual possesses afeeling of self-fulfillment andthe realizationof his or herhighest potential.) (The individual seeks self-respectand respect from others, works toachieve success and recognition inwork, and desires prestige fromaccomplishments.) (Needs are for giving and receiving ofaffection, companionship, satisfactoryinterpersonal relationships, andidentification with a group.) (Needs at this level are for avoiding harm, maintainingcomfort, order, structure, physical safety, freedom fromfear, and protection.)SELF- ACTUALIZATION SELF-ESTEEM ESTEEM-OF-OTHERS LOVE AND BELONGING SAFETY AND SECURITY PHYSIOLOGICAL NEEDS (Basic fundamental needs include food, water, air, sleep, exercise, elimination, shelter, and sexual expression.) FIGURE 2-1 Maslow's hierarchy of needs.4092_Ch02_012-026 24/07/14 5:20 PM Page 15individuals' perceptions of mental illness, regardless of cultural origin. Horwitz (2002) identifies two of these elements as (1) incomprehensibility and (2) cultural relativity. Incomprehensibility relates to the inability of the gen- eral population to understand the motivation behindthe behavior. When observers are unable to findmeaning or comprehensibility in behavior, they arelikely to label that behavior as mental illness. Horwitzstates, \"Observers attribute labels of mental illnesswhen the rules, conventions, and understandings theyuse to interpret behavior fail to find any intelligiblemotivation behind an action\" (p. 17). The element ofcultural relativity considers that these rules, conven- tions, and understandings are conceived within an in-dividual's own particular culture. Behavior that isconsidered \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" is defined byone's cultural or societal norms. Therefore, a behav-ior that is recognized as mentally ill in one society maybe viewed as \"normal\" in another society, and viceversa. Horwitz identified a number of cultural aspectsof mental illness, which are presented in Box 2-1. The American Psychiatric Association (APA, 2013), in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Men- tal Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) , defines mental disorder as: a syndrome characterized by clinically significant distur- bance in an individual's cognitions, emotion regulation,or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psycholog-ical, biological, or developmental processes underlyingmental functioning. (p. 20) For purposes of this text, and in keeping with the framework of stress/adaptation, mental illness will be characterized as \"maladaptive responses to stressors from the internal or external environment, evidencedby thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are incon-gruent with the local and cultural norms, and that in-terfere with the individual's social, occupational,and/or physical functioning.\" Psychological Adaptation to Stress All individuals exhibit some characteristics associatedwith both mental health and mental illness at anygiven point in time. Chapter 1 described how an in-dividual's response to stressful situations is influencedby his or her personal perception of the event and avariety of predisposing factors, such as heredity, tem-perament, learned response patterns, developmentalmaturity, existing coping strategies, and support sys-tems of caring others. Anxiety and grief have been described as two major, primary psychological response patterns tostress. A variety of thoughts, feelings, and behaviorsare associated with each of these response patterns.Adaptation is determined by the degree to which the16 UNIT 1 Basic Concepts in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing BOX 2-1 Cultural Aspects of Mental Illness 1. Usually members of the lay community, rather than a psy- chiatric professional, initially recognize that an individual's behavior deviates from the societal norms. 2. People who are related to an individual or who are of the same cultural or social group are less likely to label an in-dividual's behavior as mentally ill than someone who isrelationally or culturally distant. Relatives (or people ofthe same cultural or social group) try to \"normalize\" thebehavior; that is, they try to find an explanation for thebehavior. 3. Psychiatrists see a person with mental illness most often when the family members can no longer deny the illnessand often when the behavior is at its worst. The local orcultural norms define pathological behavior. 4. Individuals in the lowest social class usually display the high- est amount of mental illness symptoms. However, theytend to tolerate a wider range of behaviors that deviate fromsocietal norms and are less likely to consider these behav-iors as indicative of mental illness. Mental illness labels aremost often applied by psychiatric professionals. 5. The higher the social class, the greater the recognition of mental illness behaviors. Members of the higher socialclasses are likely to be self-labeled or labeled by familymembers or friends. Psychiatric assistance is sought nearthe first signs of emotional disturbance. 6. The more highly educated the person, the greater the recognition of mental illness behaviors. However, evenmore relevant than the amount of education is the type of education. Individuals in the more humanistic types ofprofessions (lawyers, social workers, artists, teachers,nurses) are more likely to seek psychiatric assistance thanprofessionals such as business executives, computer spe-cialists, accountants, and engineers. 7. In terms of religion, Jewish people are more likely to seek psychiatric assistance than are Catholics or Protestants. 8. Women are more likely than men to recognize the symp- toms of mental illness and seek assistance. 9. The greater the cultural distance from the mainstream of so- ciety (i.e., the fewer the ties with conventional society), the greater the likelihood of negative response by society tomental illness. For example, immigrants have a greater dis-tance from the mainstream than the native born, ethnic mi-norities greater than the dominant culture, and \"bohemians\"greater than the bourgeoisie. They are more likely to be sub-jected to coercive treatment, and involuntary psychiatriccommitments are more common. Adapted from Horwitz, A.V. (2002). The social control of mental illness.

In this most intense state of anxiety, the individual is unable to focus on even one detailin the environment. Misperceptions are common,and a loss of contact with reality may occur. The in-dividual may experience hallucinations or delu-sions. Behavior may be characterized by wild anddesperate actions or extreme withdrawal. Humanfunctioning and communication with others is in-effective. Panic anxiety is associated with a feelingof terror, and individuals may be convinced thatthey have a life-threatening illness or fear that theyare \"going crazy,\" are losing control, or are emo-tionally weak. Prolonged panic anxiety can lead tophysical and emotional exhaustion and can be alife-threatening situation. A synopsis of the characteristics associated with each of the four levels of anxiety is presented in Table 2-1. Behavioral Adaptation Responses to Anxiety A variety of behavioral adaptation responses occur ateach level of anxiety. Figure 2-2 depicts these behav-ioral responses on a continuum of anxiety rangingfrom mild to panic. Mild Anxiety At the mild level, individuals employ any of a numberof coping behaviors that satisfy their needs for com-fort. Menninger (1963) described the following typesof coping mechanisms that individuals use to relieveanxiety in stressful situations:CHAPTER 2 Mental Health/Mental Illness: Historical and Theoretical Concepts 17 Anxiety Feelings of anxiety are so common in our society thatthey are almost considered universal. Anxiety arisesfrom the chaos and confusion that exists in the worldtoday. Fears of the unknown and conditions of ambi-guity offer a perfect breeding ground for anxiety totake root and grow. Low levels of anxiety are adaptiveand can provide the motivation required for survival.Anxiety becomes problematic when the individual isunable to prevent the anxiety from escalating to a levelthat interferes with the ability to meet basic needs. Peplau (1963) described four levels of anxiety: mild, moderate, severe, and panic. It is important fornurses to be able to recognize the symptoms associ-ated with each level to plan for appropriate interven-tion with anxious individuals. Mild Anxiety. This level of anxiety is seldom a problem for the individual. It is associated with thetension experienced in response to the events ofday-to-day living. Mild anxiety prepares people foraction. It sharpens the senses, increases motivationfor productivity, increases the perceptual field, andresults in a heightened awareness of the environ-ment. Learning is enhanced and the individual isable to function at his or her optimal level. Moderate Anxiety. As the level of anxiety increases, the extent of the perceptual field diminishes. Themoderately anxious individual is less alert to eventsoccurring in the environment. The individual's at-tention span and ability to concentrate decrease,although he or she may still attend to needs withdirection. Assistance with problem solving may berequired. Increased muscular tension and restless-ness are evident. Severe Anxiety. The perceptual field of the severely anxious individual is so greatly diminished thatconcentration centers on one particular detail onlyor on many extraneous details. Attention span isextremely limited, and the individual has much dif-ficulty completing even the simplest task. Physicalsymptoms (e.g., headaches, palpitations, insomnia)and emotional symptoms (e.g., confusion, dread,horror) may be evident. Discomfort is experiencedto the degree that virtually all overt behavior isaimed at relieving the anxiety.CORE CONCEPT Anxiety A diffuse apprehension that is vague in nature and is associated with feelings of uncertainty and helplessness. Sleeping Yawning Eating Drinking Physical exercise Daydreaming Smoking Laughing CryingCursing Pacing Nail biting Foot swinging Finger tapping Fidgeting Talking to someone with whom one feelscomfortable Undoubtedly there are many more responses too numerous to mention here, considering that each in-dividual develops his or her own unique ways to relieveanxiety at the mild level. Some of these behaviors aremore adaptive than others. Mild-to-Moderate Anxiety Sigmund Freud (1961) identified the ego as the realitycomponent of the personality that governs problem solv-ing and rational thinking. As the level of anxiety in-creases, the strength of the ego is tested, and energy ismobilized to confront the threat. Anna Freud (1953)identified a number of defense mechanisms employed by the ego in the face of threat to biological or psycho-logical integrity. Some of these ego defense mechanismsare more adaptive than others, but all are used eitherconsciously or unconsciously as a protective device for4092_Ch02_012-026 24/07/14 5:20 PM Page 17the ego in an effort to relieve mild-to-moderate anxiety. They become maladaptive when they are used by an in-dividual to such a degree that there is interference withthe ability to deal with reality, with effective interper-sonal relations, or with occupational performance. Maladaptive use of defense mechanisms promotes dis-integration of the ego. The major ego defense mecha-nisms identified by Anna Freud are discussed here andsummarized in Table 2-2. 1. Compensation is the covering up of a real or per- ceived weakness by emphasizing a trait one consid-ers more desirable. EXAMPLES: (a) A handicapped boy who is unable to participate in sports compensates by becoming a great scholar. (b) A young manwho is the shortest among members of his peer group viewsthis as a deficiency and compensates by being overly aggres-sive and daring.18 UNIT 1 Basic Concepts in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing TABLE 2-1 Levels of Anxiety PERCEPTUAL ABILITY TO PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL/BEHAVIORAL LEVEL FIELD LEARN CHARACTERISTICS CHARACTERISTICS Mild Moderate Severe PanicHeightened perception (e.g., noises may seem louder; detailswithin the environ-ment are clearer) Increased awarenessIncreased alertness Reduction in perceptual field Reduced alertness to environmental events (e.g., someone talkingmay not be heard;part of the room maynot be noticed) Greatly diminished; only extraneous details are perceived,or fixation on a singledetail may occur May not take notice of an event even whenattention is directedby another Unable to focus on even one detail withinthe environment Misperceptions of the environment common(e.g., a perceiveddetail may be elabo-rated and out of proportion)Learning is enhanced Learning still occurs, but not atoptimal ability Decreased attention span Decreased ability to concentrate Extremely limited attention span Unable to concentrate orproblem-solve Effective learning cannot occur Learning cannot occur Unable to concentrate Unable to compre- hend even simple directionsMay remain superficial with others Rarely experienced as distressful Motivation is increased A feeling of discontent May lead to a degree of impairment in interper-sonal relationships as individual begins tofocus on self and theneed to relieve personaldiscomfort Feelings of dread, loathing, horror Total focus on self and intense desire to relievethe anxiety Sense of impending doom TerrorBizarre behavior, including shouting, screaming,running about wildly,clinging to anyone oranything from which asense of safety and security is derived Hallucinations; delusions Extreme withdrawal into selfRestlessnessIrritability Increased restlessness Increased heart and respiration rate Increased perspirationGastric discomfortIncreased muscular tension Increase in speech rate, volume, and pitch HeadachesDizzinessNauseaTremblingInsomniaPalpitationsTachycardiaHyperventilationUrinary frequencyDiarrhea Dilated less hyperactivity Incoherence or inability to verbalize Mild Moderate Severe Panic Coping mechanismsEgo defense mechanismsPsycho- neurotic responsesPsychotic responses Psycho- physiological continuum 24/07/14 5:20 PM Page 18CHAPTER 2 Mental Health/Mental Illness: Historical and Theoretical Concepts 19 TABLE 2-2 Ego Defense Mechanisms DEFENSE MECHANISM EXAMPLE DEFENSE MECHANISM EXAMPLE COMPENSATION RATIONALIZATION Covering up a real or perceived weakness by emphasizing a trait one considers more desirable.

INTELLECTUALIZATIONAn attempt to avoid expressing actual emotions associated with a stressful situation by using the intellectual processes of log i c, reasoning, and analysis. INTROJECTIONIntegrating the beliefs and values of another individual into one's own ego structure. ISOLATIONSeparating a thought or memory from the feeling, tone, or emotion associated with it. PROJECTIONAttributing feelings or impulses unacceptable to one's self to another person.A physically handicapped boy is unable to partici-pate in football, so hecompensates by be-coming a great scholar. A woman drinks alcohol every day and cannotstop, failing to ac-knowledge that shehas a problem. A client is angry with his physician, does not ex-press it, but becomesverbally abusive withthe nurse. A teenager who required lengthy rehabilitationafter an accident decides to become aphysical therapist as aresult of his experiences.

On his way home he stopsand buys her some flowers.4092_Ch02_012-026 24/07/14 5:20 PM Page 192. Denial is the refusal to acknowledge the existence of a real situation or the feelings associated with it. EXAMPLES: (a) A woman has been told by her family doctor that she has a lump in her breast. An appointment is made for herwith a surgeon; however, she does not keep the appoint-ment and goes about her activities of daily living with noevidence of concern. (b) Individuals continue to smokecigarettes even though they have been told of the healthrisks involved. 3. Displacement is the transferring of feelings from one target to another that is considered less threat- ening or neutral. EXAMPLES: (a) A man who is passed over for promotion on his job says nothing to his boss but later belittles his son for not makingthe basketball team. (b) A boy who is teased and hit by theclass bully on the playground comes home after school andkicks his dog. 4. Identification is an attempt to increase self-worth by acquiring certain attributes and characteristics of an individual one admires. EXAMPLES (a) A teenage girl emulates the mannerisms and style of dress of a popular female rock star. (b) The young son of afamous civil rights worker adopts his father's attitudes andbehaviors with the intent of pursuing similar aspirations. 5. Intellectualization is an attempt to avoid express- ing actual emotions associated with a stressful sit- uation by using the intellectual processes of logic,reasoning, and analysis. EXAMPLES: (a) A man whose brother is in a cardiac intensive care unit following a severe myocardial infarction (MI) spends his al-lotted visiting time in discussion with the nurse, analyzingtest results and making a reasonable determination aboutthe pathophysiology that may have occurred to induce theMI. (b) A young psychology professor receives a letter fromhis fianc\u00e9e breaking off their engagement. He shows noemotion when discussing this with his best friend. Insteadhe analyzes his fianc\u00e9e's behavior and tries to reason whythe relationship failed. 6. Introjection is the internalization of the beliefs and values of another individual such that they symbol- ically become a part of the self to the extent thatthe feeling of separateness or distinctness is lost. EXAMPLES: (a) A small child develops her conscience by internalizing what the parents believe is right and wrong. The parents literally become a part of the child. The child says to a friendwhile playing, \"Don't hit people. It's not nice!\" (b) A psychiatricclient claims to be the Son of God, drapes himself in sheetand blanket, \"performs miracles\" on other clients, and refusesto respond unless addressed as Jesus Christ. 7. Isolation is the separation of a thought or a mem- ory from the feeling, tone, or emotions associated with it (sometimes called emotional isolation). EXAM PLES: (a) A young woman describes being attacked and raped bya street gang. She displays an apathetic expression and noemotional tone. (b) A physician is able to isolate her feelingsabout the eventual death of a terminally ill cancer client byfocusing her attention instead on the chemotherapy that willbe given. 8. Projection is the attribution of feelings or im- pulses unacceptable to one's self to another per - son. The individual \"passes the blame\" for these undesirable feelings or impulses to another,thereby providing relief from the anxiety associ-ated with them. EXAMPLES: (a) A young soldier who has an extreme fear of participating in military combat tells his sergeant that the others in his unitare \"a bunch of cowards.\" (b) A businessperson who valuespunctuality is late for a meeting and states, \"Sorry I'm late.My assistant forgot to remind me of the time. It's so hard tofind good help these days.\" 9. Rationalization is the attempt to make excuses or formulate logical reasons to justify unacceptable feelings or behaviors. EXAMPLES: (a) A self-employed person deliberately neglects to report part of her income to the Internal Revenue Service, and jus-tifies it to herself by saying, \"It's okay. Everybody does it.\"(b) A young man is unable to afford the sports car he wantsso desperately. He tells the salesperson, \"I'd buy this carbut I'll be getting married soon. This is really not the car fora family man.\" 10. Reaction formation is the prevention of unac- ceptable or undesirable thoughts or behaviors from being expressed by exaggerating oppositethoughts or types of behaviors. EXAMPLES: (a) The young soldier who has an extreme fear of partici- pating in military combat volunteers for dangerous front-line duty. (b) A secretary is sexually attracted to her bossand feels an intense dislike toward his wife. She treats herboss with detachment and aloofness while performing her20 UNIT 1 Basic Concepts in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing4092_Ch02_012-026 24/07/14 5:20 PM Page 20secretarial duties and is overly courteous, polite, and flat- tering to his wife when she comes to the office. 11. Regression is the retreating to an earlier level of development and the comfort measures associ- ated with that level of functioning. EXAMPLES: (a) When his mother brings his new baby sister home from the hospital, 4-year-old Tommy, who had been toilet trainedfor more than a year, begins to wet his pants, cry to be held,and suck his thumb. (b) A person who is depressed maywithdraw to his or her room, curl up in a fetal position onthe bed, and sleep for long periods of time. 12. Repression is the involuntary blocking of unpleas- ant feelings and experiences from one's awareness. EXAM PLES: (a) A woman cannot remember being sexually assaultedwhen she was 15 years old. (b) A teenage boy cannot re-member driving the car that was involved in an accident inwhich his best friend was killed. 13. Sublimation is the rechanneling of drives or im- pulses that are personally or socially unacceptable (e.g., aggressiveness, anger, sexual drives) into ac- tivities that are more tolerable and constructive. EXAM PLES: (a) A teenage boy with strong competitive and aggressive drives becomes the star football player on his high schoolteam. (b) A young unmarried woman with a strong desirefor marriage and a family achieves satisfaction and successin establishing and operating a day-care center for preschoolchildren. 14. Suppression is the voluntary blocking of un- pleasant feelings and experiences from one's awareness. EXAM PLES: (a) Scarlett O'Hara says, \"I'll think about that tomorrow.\" (b) A young woman who is depressed about a pendingdivorce proceeding tells the nurse, \"I just don't want totalk about the divorce. There's nothing I can do about itanyway.\" 15. Undoing is the act of symbolically negating or canceling out a previous action or experience that one finds intolerable. EXAMPLES: (a) A man spills some salt on the table, then sprinkles some over his left shoulder to \"prevent bad luck.\" (b) A man whois anxious about giving a presentation at work yells at his wifeduring breakfast. He stops on his way home from work thatevening to buy her a dozen red roses.Moderate-to-Severe Anxiety Anxiety at the moderate-to-severe level that remains unresolved over an extended period of time can con-tribute to a number of physiological disorders. TheDSM- 5(APA, 2013) describes these disorders under the category of \"Psychological Factors AffectingOther Medical Conditions.\" The psychological factorsmay exacerbate symptoms of, delay recovery from, orinterfere with treatment of the medical condition.The condition may be initiated or exacerbated by anenvironmental situation that the individual perceivesas stressful. Measurable pathophysiology can bedemonstrated. It is thought that psychological andbehavioral factors may affect the course of almostevery major category of disease, including, but notlimited to, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neoplas-tic, neurological, and pulmonary conditions. Severe Anxiety Extended periods of repressed severe anxiety can re-sult in psychoneurotic patterns of behaving. Neurosisis no longer considered a separate category of mentaldisorder. However, the term sometimes is still used inthe literature to further describe the symptomatologyof certain disorders and to differentiate from behav-iors that occur at the more serious level of psychosis. Neuroses are psychiatric disturbances, characterizedby excessive anxiety that is expressed directly or al-tered through defense mechanisms. It appears as asymptom, such as an obsession, a compulsion, a pho-bia, or a sexual dysfunction (Sadock & Sadock, 2007).The following are common characteristics of peoplewith neuroses: They are aware that they are experiencing distress. They are aware that their behaviors are maladaptive. They are unaware of any possible psychologicalcauses of the distress. They feel helpless to change their situation. They experience no loss of contact with reality. The following disorders are examples of psy- choneurotic responses to anxiety as they appear inthe DSM-5: 1. Anxiety Disorders. Disorders in which the character- istic features are symptoms of anxiety and avoidancebehavior (e.g., phobias, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder , and separation anxiety disorder). 2. Somatic Symptom Disorders. Disorders in which the characteristic features are physical symptomsfor which there is no demonstrable organicpathology. Psychological factors are judged to play a significant role in the onset, severity, exac-erbation, or maintenance of the symptoms (e.g.,somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disor-der, conversion disorder, and factitious disorder).CHAPTER 2 Mental Health/Mental Illness: Historical and Theoretical Concepts 214092_Ch02_012-026 24/07/14 5:20 PM Page 213. Dissociative Disorders. Disorders in which the characteristic feature is a disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory , identity, or perception of the environment (e.g.,dissociative amnesia, dissociative identity disorder,and depersonalization-derealization disorder). Panic Anxiety At this extreme level of anxiety, an individual is not capable of processing what is happening in the environment, and may lose contact with reality.Psychosis is defined as \"a severe mental disorder characterized by gross impairment in reality testing,typically manifested by delusions, hallucinations,disorganized speech, or disorganized or catatonic be-havior\" (Black & Andreasen, 2011, p. 618). The fol-lowing are common chara cteristics of people with psychoses: They exhibit minimal distress (emotional tone isflat, bland, or inappropriate). They are unaware that their behavior is maladaptive. They are unaware of any psychological problems. They are exhibiting a flight from reality into a lessstressful world or into one in which they are attempt-ing to adapt. Examples of psychotic responses to anxiety in- clude the schizophrenic, schizoaffective, and delu-sional disorders. Grief Most individuals experience intense emotional an-guish in response to a significant personal loss. A lossis anything that is perceived as such by the individ-ual. Losses may be real, in which case they can besubstantiated by others (e.g., death of a loved one,loss of personal possessions), or they may be per-ceived by the individual alone, unable to be sharedor identified by others (e.g., loss of the feeling offemininity following mastectomy). Any situation thatcreates change for an individual can be identified asa loss. Failure (either real or perceived) also can beviewed as a loss. The loss, or anticipated loss, of anything of value to an individual can trigger the grief response. Thisperiod of characteristic emotions and behaviors iscalled mourning. The \"normal\" mourning process isadaptive and is characterized by feelings of sadness,guilt, anger, helplessness, hopelessness, and despair.Indeed, an absence of mourning after a loss may beconsidered maladaptive. Stages of Grief K\u00fcbler-Ross (1969), in extensive research with termi-nally ill patients, identified five stages of feelings andbehaviors that individuals experience in response toa real, perceived, or anticipated loss: Stage 1\u2014 Denial. This is a stage of shock and disbe- lief. The response may be one of \"No, it can't be true!\" The reality of the loss is not acknowl-edged. Denial is a protective mechanism that al-lows the individual to cope in an immediate timeframe while organizing more effective defensestrategies. Stage 2\u2014 Anger. \"Why me?\" and \"It's not fair!\" are comments often expressed during the angerstage. Envy and resentment toward individualsnot affected by the loss are common. Anger maybe directed at the self or displaced on lovedones, caregivers, and even God. There may be apreoccupation with an idealized image of thelost entity. Stage 3\u2014Bargaining. During this stage, which is usu- ally not visible or evident to others, a \"bargain\" ismade with God in an attempt to reverse or post-pone the loss: \"If God will help me through this, Ipromise I will go to church every Sunday and vol-unteer my time to help others.\" Sometimes thepromise is associated with feelings of guilt for nothaving performed satisfactorily, appropriately, orsufficiently. Stage 4\u2014Depression. During this stage, the full im- pact of the loss is experienced. The sense of lossis intense, and feelings of sadness and depressionprevail. This is a time of quiet desperation and dis-engagement from all association with the lost en-tity. It differs from pathological depression, which occurs when an individual becomes fixed in anearlier stage of the grief process. Rather, stage 4of the grief response represents advancement to-ward resolution. Stage 5\u2014Acceptance. The final stage brings a feeling of peace regarding the loss that has occurred. It isa time of quiet expectation and resignation. Thefocus is on the reality of the loss and its meaningfor the individuals affected by it. All individuals do not experience each of these stages in response to a loss, nor do they necessarily experience them in this order. Some individuals'grieving behaviors may fluctuate, and even overlap,between stages.22 UNIT 1 Basic Concepts in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing CORE CONCEPT Grief Grief is a subjective state of emotional, physical, and social responses to the loss of a valued entity. 4092_Ch02_012-026 24/07/14 5:20 PM Page 22Anticipatory Grief When a loss is anticipated, individuals often begin the work of grieving before the actual loss occurs. Mostpeople re-experience the grieving behaviors once theloss occurs, but having this time to prepare for theloss can facilitate the process of mourning, actuallydecreasing the length and intensity of the response.Problems arise, particularly in anticipating the deathof a loved one, when family members experience an- ticipatory grieving and the mourning process is com- pleted prematurely. They disengage emotionally fromthe dying person, who may then experience feelingsof rejection by loved ones at a time when this psycho-logical support is so necessary. Resolution The grief response can last from weeks to years. It can-not be hurried, and individuals must be allowed toprogress at their own pace. In the loss of a loved one,grief work usually lasts for at least a year, during whichthe grieving person experiences each significant \"an-niversary\" date for the first time without the loved onepresent. Length of the grief process may be prolonged by a number of factors. If the relationship with the lost en-tity had been marked by ambivalence or if there hadbeen an enduring \"love-hate\" association, reaction tothe loss may be burdened with guilt. Guilt lengthensthe grief reaction by promoting feelings of anger to-ward the self for having committed a wrongdoing orbehaved in an unacceptable manner toward thatwhich is now lost, and perhaps the grieving personmay even feel that his or her behavior has contributedto the loss. Anticipatory grieving is thought to shorten the grief response in some individuals who are able towork through some of the feelings before the loss oc-curs. If the loss is sudden and unexpected, mourningmay take longer than it would if individuals were ableto grieve in anticipation of the loss. Length of the grieving process is also affected by the number of recent losses experienced by an in-dividual and whether he or she is able to completeone grieving process before another loss occurs.This is particularly true for elderly individuals whomay be experiencing numerous losses, such asspouse, friends, other relatives, independent func-tioning, home, personal possessions, and pets, in arelatively short time. Grief accumulates, and thisrepresents a type of bereavement overload, whichfor some individuals presents an impossible task ofgrief work. Resolution of the process of mourning is thought to have occurred when an individual can look backon the relationship with the lost entity and acceptboth the pleasures and the disappointments (boththe positive and the negative aspects) of the associa-tion (Bowlby & Parkes, 1970). Disorganization andemotional pain have been experienced and tolerated.Preoccupation with the lost entity has been replacedwith energy and the desire to pursue new situationsand relationships. Maladaptive Grief Responses Maladaptive responses to loss occur when an indi-vidual is not able to satisfactorily progress throughthe stages of grieving to achieve resolution. Theseresponses usually occur when an individual becomesfixed in the denial or anger stage of the griefprocess. Several types of grief responses have beenidentified as pathological. They include responsesthat are prolonged, delayed or inhibited, or dis-torted. The prolonged response is characterized by an intense preoccupation with memories of the lost en-tity for many years after the loss has occurred . Behaviors associated with the stages of denial or anger aremanifested, and disorganization of functioning andintense emotional pain related to the lost entity areevidenced. In the delayed or inhibited response, the individual becomes fixed in the denial stage of the grievingprocess. The emotional pain associated with theloss is not experienced, but anxiety disorders (e.g.,phobias, somatic symptom disorders) or sleepingand eating disorders (e.g., insomnia, anorexia) maybe evident. The individual may remain in denial formany years until the grief response is triggered bya reminder of the loss or even by another, unre-lated loss. The individual who experiences a distorted re- sponse is fixed in the anger stage of grieving. In thedistorted response, all the normal behaviors associ-ated with grieving, such as helplessness, hopelessness,sadness, anger, and guilt, are exaggerated out of pro-portion to the situation. The individual turns theanger inward on the self, is consumed with over-whelming despair, and is unable to function in nor-mal activities of daily living. Pathological depressionis a distorted grief response. Mental Health/Mental Illness Continuum Anxiety and grief have been described as two major,primary responses to stress. In Figure 2-3, both ofthese responses are presented on a continuum ac-cording to degree of symptom severity. Disorders asthey appear in the DSM- 5are identified at their ap- propriate placement along the continuum.CHAPTER 2 Mental Health/Mental Illness: Historical and Theoretical Concepts 234092_Ch02_012-026 24/07/14 5:20 PM Page 23Summary and Key Points Psychiatric care has its roots in ancient times, when etiology was based in superstition and ideas relatedto the supernatural. Treatments were often inhumane and included bru-tal beatings, starvation, or other torturous means. Hippocrates associated insanity and mental illnesswith an irregularity in the interaction of the fourbody fluids (humors)\u2014blood, black bile, yellowbile, and phlegm. Conditions for care of the mentally ill have im-proved, largely because of the influence of leaderssuch as Benjamin Rush, Dorothea Dix, and LindaRichards, whose endeavors provided a model formore humanistic treatment. Maslow identified a \"hierarchy of needs\" that indi-viduals seek to fulfill on their quest to self-actual-ization (one's highest potential). For purposes of this text, the definition of mentalhealth is viewed as \"the successful adaptation to stres- sors from the internal or external environment, ev-idenced by thoughts, feelings, and behaviors thatare age-appropriate and congruent with local andcultural norms.\" In determining mental illness, individuals are in-fluenced by incomprehensibility of the behavior; that is, whether or not they are able to understand themotivation behind the behavior. Another consideration is cultural relativity. The\"normality\" of behavior is determined by culturaland societal norms. For purposes of this text, the definition of mental ill- nessis viewed as \"maladaptive responses to stressors from the internal or external environment, evi-denced by thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that areincongruent with the local and cultural norms, andthat interfere with the individual's social, occupa-tional, and/or physical functioning.\" Anxiety and grief have been described as twomajor, primary psychological response patternsto stress. Peplau defined anxiety by levels of symptom sever-ity: mild, moderate, severe, and panic. Behaviors associated with levels of anxiety includecoping mechanisms, ego defense mechanisms,24 UNIT 1 Basic Concepts in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing Feelings of SadnessDysthymiaCyclothymic DisorderMajor DepressionBipolar Disorder Life's EverydayDisappointmentsNeurotic ResponsesPsychotic Responses Grief Anxiety Anxiety Panic Coping MechanismsEgo DefenseMechanismsPsychoneuroticResponsesPsychotic Responses Sleeping FIGURE 2-3 Conceptualization of anxiety and grief responses along the mental health/mental illness continuum.4092_Ch02_012-026 24/07/14 5:20 PM Page 24psychophysiological responses, psychoneurotic re- sponses, and psychotic responses. Grief is described as a response to loss of a valuedentity. Loss is anything that is perceived as such bythe individual. K\u00fcbler-Ross, in extensive research with terminallyill patients, identified five stages of feelings and be-haviors that individuals experience in response toa real, perceived, or anticipated loss: denial, anger,bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Anticipatory grief is grief work that is begun, andsometimes completed, before the loss occurs.Resolution is thought to occur when an individualis able to remember and accept both the positiveand negative aspects associated with the lost entity. Grieving is thought to be maladaptive when themourning process is prolonged, delayed or inhib-ited, or becomes distorted and exaggerated out ofproportion to the situation. Pathological depres-sion is considered to be a distorted reaction.CHAPTER 2 Mental Health/Mental Illness: Historical and Theoretical Concepts 25 Additional info available at www.davisplus.com Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

Nurses must have a basic knowledge of human per- sonality development to understand maladaptive behav-ioral responses commonly seen in psychiatric clients.Developmental theories identify behaviors associatedwith various stages through which individuals pass, thereby specifying what is appropriate or inappropriateat each developmental level. Specialists in child development believe that infancy and early childhood are the major life periodsfor the origination and occurrence of developmentalchange. Specialists in life-cycle development believethat people continue to develop and change through-out life, thereby suggesting the possibility for renewaland growth in adults. Developmental stages are identified by age. Behav- iors can then be evaluated by whether or not they arerecognized as age-appropriate. Ideally, an individualsuccessfully fulfills all the tasks associated with onestage before moving on to the next stage (at the appro-priate age). Realistically, however, this seldom happens.One reason is related to temperament, or the inbornpersonality characteristics that influence an individ-ual's manner of reacting to the environment, and ulti-mately his or her developmental progression (Chess &Thomas, 1986). The environment may also influenceone's developmental pattern. Individuals who arereared in a dysfunctional family system often have re-tarded ego development. According to specialists inlife-cycle development, behaviors from an unsuccess-fully completed stage can be modified and correctedin a later stage. Stages overlap, and an individual may be working on tasks associated with several stages at one time.When an individual becomes fixed in a lower level of development, with age-inappropriate behaviors focused on fulfillment of those tasks, psychopathologymay become evident. Only when personality traits be-come inflexible, and personality functioning becomesindividually and interpersonally impaired, do theyconstitute personality disorders.Psychoanalytic Theory Sigmund Freud (1961), who has been called the father of psychiatry, is credited as the first to identifydevelopment by stages. He considered the first 5 yearsof a child's life to be the most important, because hebelieved that an individual's basic character had beenformed by the age of 5. Freud's personality theory can be conceptualized according to structure and dynamics of the personal-ity, topography of the mind, and stages of personalitydevelopment. Structure of the Personality Freud organized the structure of the personality intothree major components: the id , ego, and superego. They are distinguished by their unique functions anddifferent characteristics. Id The idis the locus of instinctual drives\u2014the principle.\" Present at birth, it endows the infant withinstinctual drives that seek to satisfy needs andachieve immediate gratification. Id-driven behaviorsare impulsive and may be irrational. Ego The ego, also called the rational self or the \"reality prin- ciple,\" begins to develop between the ages of 4 and 6 months. The ego experiences the reality of the ex-ternal world, adapts to it, and responds to it. As theego develops and gains strength, it seeks to bring theinfluences of the external world to bear upon the id,to substitute the reality principle for the pleasureprinciple (Marmer, 2003). A primary function of theego is one of mediator; that is, to maintain harmonyamong the external world, the id, and the superego. Superego If the id is identified as the pleasure principle, andthe ego the reality principle, the superego might be re- ferred to as the \"perfection principle.\" The superego,which develops between ages 3 and 6 years, internal-izes the values and morals set forth by primary caregivers. Derived out of a system of rewards andpunishments, the superego is composed of two majorcomponents: the ego -ideal and the conscience. When a child is consistently rewarded for \"good\" behavior, theself-esteem is enhanced, and the behavior becomespart of the ego-ideal; that is, it is internalized as partof his or her value system. The conscience is formedwhen the child is punished consistently for \"bad\" be-havior. The child learns what is considered morallyright or wrong from feedback received from parentalfigures and from society or culture. When moral andCHAPTER 3 Theoretical Models of Personality Development 29 CORE CONCEPT Personality The combination of character, behavioral, temperamen- tal, emotional, and mental traits that are unique to eachspecific individual. 4092_Ch03_027-046 25/07/14 10:23 AM Page 29ethical principles or even internalized ideals and values are disregarded, the conscience generates afeeling of guilt within the individual. The superegois important in the socialization of the individual because it assists the ego in the control of id impulses. When the superego becomes rigid andpunitive, problems with low self-confidence and lowself-esteem arise. Examples of behaviors associatedwith these components of the personality are pre-sented in Box 3-1. Topography of the Mind Freud classified all mental contents and operationsinto three categories: the conscious, the precon-scious, and the unconscious. The conscious includes all memories that remain within an individual's awareness. It is the smallest of thethree categories. Events and experiences that areeasily remembered or retrieved are considered to bewithin one's conscious awareness. Examples includetelephone numbers, birthdays of self and significantothers, the dates of special holidays, and what onehad for lunch today. The conscious mind is thoughtto be under the control of the ego, the rational andlogical structure of the personality. The preconscious includes all memories that may have been forgotten or are not in present aware-ness but with attention can be readily recalled intoconsciousness. Examples include telephone num-bers or addresses once known but little used andfeelings associated with significant life events thatmay have occurred at sometime in the past. Thepreconscious enhances awareness by helping tosuppress unpleasant or nonessential memories from consciousness. It is thought to be partially underthe control of the superego, which helps to sup-press unacceptable thoughts and behaviors. The unconscious includes all memories that one is unable to bring to conscious awareness. It is thelargest of the three topographical levels. Uncon-scious material consists of unpleasant or nonessen-tial memories that have been repressed and can be retrieved only through therapy, hypnosis, and withcertain substances that alter awareness and havethe capacity to restructure repressed memories.Unconscious material may also emerge in dreamsand in seemingly incomprehensible behavior. Dynamics of the Personality Freud believed that psychic energy is the force or impe- tus required for mental functioning. Originating inthe id, it instinctually fulfills basic physiological needs.Freud called this psychic energy (or the drive to fulfillbasic physiological needs such as hunger, thirst, andsex) the libido. As the child matures, psychic energyis diverted from the id to form the ego and then fromthe ego to form the superego. Psychic energy is dis-tributed within these three components, with the egoretaining the largest share to maintain a balance between the impulsive behaviors of the id and the ide-alistic behaviors of the superego. If an excessiveamount of psychic energy is stored in one of these per-sonality components, behavior will reflect that part ofthe personality. For instance, impulsive behavior pre-vails when excessive psychic energy is stored in the id.Over-investment in the ego reflects self-absorbed, ornarcissistic, behaviors; an excess within the superegoresults in rigid, self-deprecating behaviors. Freud used the terms cathexis and anticathexis to describe the forces within the id, ego, and superegothat are used to invest psychic energy in externalsources to satisfy needs. Cathexis is the process bywhich the id invests energy into an object in an at-tempt to achieve gratification. An example is the indi-vidual who instinctively turns to alcohol to relievestress. Anticathexis is the use of psychic energy bythe ego and the superego to control id impulses. In the example cited, the ego would attempt to con-trol the use of alcohol with rational thinking, such as,\"I already have ulcers from drinking too much. I willcall my AA counselor for support. I will not drink.\"The superego would exert control with thinkingsuch as \"I shouldn't drink. If I drink, my family willbe hurt and angry. I should think of how it affectsthem. I'm such a weak person.\" Freud believed that30 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing BOX 3-1 Structure of the Personality BEHAVIORAL EXAMPLES Id Ego Superego \"I found this wallet; I will keep the money . \" \"Mom and Dad are gone. Let's party!!!!!\" \"I'll have sex with whomever I please, whenever havemoney. while away. can very rightto doesn'tbelong to you.\" \"Never disobey is wrong.\"4092_Ch03_027-046 25/07/14 10:23 Page 30an imbalance between cathexis and anticathexis re- sulted in internal conflicts, producing tension andanxiety within the individual. Freud's daughter Annadevised a comprehensive list of defense mechanismsbelieved to be used by the ego as a protective deviceagainst anxiety in mediating between the excessivedemands of the id and the excessive restrictions ofthe superego (see Chapter 2). Freud's Stages of Personality Development Freud described formation of the personality throughfive stages of psychosexual development. He placed much emphasis on the first 5 years of life and believed thatcharacteristics developed during these early years boreheavily on one's adaptation patterns and personalitytraits in adulthood. Fixation in an early stage of devel-opment will almost certainly result in psychopathology.An outline of these five stages is presented in Table 3-1. Oral Stage: Birth to 18 Months During the oral stage, behavior is directed by the id,and the goal is immediate gratification of needs. Thefocus of energy is the mouth, with behaviors that in-clude sucking, chewing, and biting. The infant feelsa sense of attachment and is unable to differentiatethe self from the person who is providing the moth-ering. This includes feelings such as anxiety. Becauseof this lack of differentiation, a pervasive feeling ofanxiety on the part of the mother may be passed onto her infant, leaving the child vulnerable to similarfeelings of insecurity. With the beginning of develop-ment of the ego at age 4 to 6 months, the infant startsto view the self as separate from the mothering figure.A sense of security and the ability to trust others is de-rived from the gratification of fulfilling basic needsduring this stage. Anal Stage: 18 Months to 3 Years The major task in the anal stage is gaining independ-ence and control, with particular focus on the excre-tory function. Freud believed that the manner inwhich the parents and other primary caregivers ap-proach the task of toilet training may have far-reachingeffects on the child in terms of values and personalitycharacteristics. When toilet training is strict and rigid,the child may choose to retain the feces, becomingconstipated. Adult retentive personality traits influ-enced by this type of training include stubbornness,stinginess, and miserliness. An alternate reaction tostrict toilet training is for the child to expel feces inan unacceptable manner or at inappropriate times.Far-reaching effects of this behavior pattern includemalevolence, cruelty to others, destructiveness, disor-ganization, and untidiness. Toilet training that is more permissive and accept- ing attaches the feeling of importance and desirabilityto feces production. The child becomes extroverted,productive, and altruistic. Phallic Stage: 3 to 6 Years In the phallic stage, the focus of energy shifts to thegenital area. Discovery of differences between gen-ders results in a heightened interest in the sexualityof self and others. This interest may be manifested insexual self-exploratory or group-exploratory play.Freud proposed that the development of the Oedipus complex (males) or Electra complex (females) occurred during this stage of development. He described thisas the child's unconscious desire to eliminate the par-ent of the same gender and to possess the parent ofthe opposite gender for him- or herself. Guilt feelingsresult with the emergence of the superego duringthese years. Resolution of this internal conflict occurswhen the child develops a strong identification withthe parent of the same gender and internalizes thatparent's attitudes, beliefs, and value system. Latency Stage: 6 to 12 Years During the elementary school years, the focus changesfrom egocentrism to more interest in group activities,learning, and socialization with peers. Sexuality is not absent during this period but remains obscure andCHAPTER 3 Theoretical Models of Personality Development 31 TABLE 3-1 Freud's Stages of Psychosexual Development AGE STAGE MAJOR DEVELOPMENTAL TASKS Birth-18 months 18 months-3 years 3-6 years 6-12 years13-20 yearsRelief from anxiety through oral gratification of needsLearning independence and control, with focus on the excretory functionIdentification with parent of same gender; development of sexual identity; focus on genital organs Sexuality repressed; focus on relationships with same-gender peersLibido reawakened as genital organs mature; focus on relationships members of the opposite genderOralAnalPhallic Latency Genital4092_Ch03_027-046 25/07/14 10:23 AM Page 31imperceptible to others. The preference is for same- gender relationships, even rejecting members of theopposite gender. Genital Stage: 13 to 20 Years In the genital stage, the maturing of the genital or-gans results in a reawakening of the libidinal drive.The focus is on relationships with members of theopposite gender and preparations for selecting amate. The development of sexual maturity evolvesfrom self-gratification to behaviors deemed accept-able by societal norms. Interpersonal relationshipsare based on genuine pleasure derived from the interaction rather than from the more self-servingimplications of childhood associations. Relevance of Psychoanalytic Theory to Nursing Practice Knowledge of the structure of the personality can as- sist nurses who work in the mental health setting. Theability to recognize behaviors associated with the id,the ego, and the superego assists in the assessment ofdevelopmental level. Understanding the use of egodefense mechanisms is important in making determi-nations about maladaptive behaviors, in planningcare for clients to assist in creating change (if de-sired), or in helping clients accept themselves asunique individuals. CLINICAL PEARL Assessing Patient Behaviors Id BehaviorsThose behaviors that follow the principle of \"if it feels good, doit.\" Social and cultural acceptability are not considered. It reflectsa need for immediate gratification. Individuals with a strong idshow little if any remorse for their unacceptable behavior. Ego Behaviors Behaviors that reflect the rational part of the personality. An effortis made to delay gratification and to satisfy societal expectations.The ego uses defense mechanisms to cope and regain control overid impulses. Superego Behaviors Behaviors that are somewhat uncompromising and rigid. Basedon morality and society's values. Behaviors of the superego strivefor perfection. Violation of the superego's standards generates guilt and anxiety in an individual who has a strong superego. Interpersonal Theory Harry Stack Sullivan (1953) believed that individual behavior and personality development are the directresult of interpersonal relationships. Before the de-velopment of his own theoretical framework, Sulli-van embraced the concepts of Freud. Later, hechanged the focus of his work from the intrapersonal view of Freud to one with a more interpersonal flavorin which human behavior could be observed in social interactions with others. His ideas, which werenot universally accepted at the time, have been inte-grated into the practice of psychiatry through pub-lication only since his death in 1949. Sullivan's majorconcepts include the following: Anxiety is a feeling of emotional discomfort, toward the relief or prevention of which all behavior isaimed. Sullivan believed that anxiety is the \"chiefdisruptive force in interpersonal relations and themain factor in the development of serious difficul-ties in living\" (p. XV). It arises out of one's inabilityto satisfy needs or to achieve interpersonal security. Satisfaction of needs is the fulfillment of all require- ments associated with an individual's physiochemi-cal environment. Sullivan identified examples ofthese requirements as oxygen, food, water, warmth,tenderness, rest, activity, sexual expression\u2014virtuallyanything that, when absent, produces discomfort inthe individual. Interpersonal security is the feeling associated with relief from anxiety. When all needs have been met,one experiences a sense of total well-being, whichSullivan termed interpersonal security. He believed individuals have an innate need for interpersonalsecurity. Self-system is a collection of experiences, or security measures, adopted by the individual to protectagainst anxiety. Sullivan identified three compo-nents of the self-system, which are based on inter-personal experiences early in life: The \" good me\" is the part of the personality that develops in response to positive feedback fromthe primary caregiver. Feelings of pleasure, con-tentment, and gratification are experienced. Thechild learns which behaviors elicit this positiveresponse as it becomes incorporated into theself-system. The \" bad me\" is the part of the personality that develops in response to negative feedback fromthe primary caregiver. Anxiety is experienced,eliciting feelings of discomfort, displeasure, anddistress. The child learns to avoid these negativefeelings by altering certain behaviors. The \"not me\" is the part of the personality that develops in response to situations that produceintense anxiety in the child. Feelings of horror,awe, dread, and loathing are experienced in response to these situations, leading the child todeny these feelings in an effort to relieve anxiety.These feelings, having then been denied, become\"not me,\" but someone else. This withdrawalfrom emotions has serious implications for men-tal disorders in adult life.32 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing4092_Ch03_027-046 25/07/14 10:23 AM Page 32Sullivan's Stages of Personality Development Sullivan described six stages of personality develop- ment. An outline of the stages of personality develop-ment according to Sullivan's interpersonal theory ispresented in Table 3-2. Infancy: Birth to 18 Months During the beginning stage, the major developmentaltask for the child is the gratification of needs. This isaccomplished through activity associated with themouth, such as crying, nursing, and thumb sucking. Childhood: 18 Months to 6 Years At ages 18 months to 6 years, the child learns that in-terference with fulfillment of personal wishes and de-sires may result in delayed gratification. He or shelearns to accept this and feel comfortable with it, rec-ognizing that delayed gratification often results inparental approval, a more lasting type of reward. Toolsof this stage include the mouth, the anus, language,experimentation, manipulation, and identification. Juvenile: 6 to 9 Years The major task of the juvenile stage is formation ofsatisfactory relationships within peer groups. This isaccomplished through the use of competition, coop-eration, and compromise. Preadolescence: 9 to 12 Years The tasks at the preadolescence stage focus on devel-oping relationships with persons of the same gender.One's ability to collaborate with and show love and affection for another person begins at this stage. Early Adolescence: 12 to 14 Years During early adolescence, the child is struggling withdeveloping a sense of identity that is separate and independent from the parents. The major task is for-mation of satisfactory relationships with members ofthe opposite gender. Sullivan saw the emergence oflust in response to biological changes as a major forceoccurring during this period. Late Adolescence: 14 to 21 Years The late adolescent period is characterized by tasksassociated with the attempt to achieve interdepend-ence within the society and the formation of a lasting,intimate relationship with a selected member of theopposite gender. The genital organs are the major developmental focus of this stage. Relevance of Interpersonal Theory to Nursing Practice The interpersonal theory has significant relevance to nursing practice. Relationship development, which isa major concept of this theory, is a major psychiatricnursing intervention. Nurses develop therapeutic re-lationships with clients in an effort to help them gen-eralize this ability to interact successfully with others. Knowledge about the behaviors associated with all levels of anxiety and methods for alleviating anxietyhelps nurses to assist clients achieve interpersonal secu-rity and a sense of well-being. Nurses use the conceptsof Sullivan's theory to help clients achieve a higher de-gree of independent and interpersonal functioning. Theory of Psychosocial Development Erik Erikson (1963) studied the influence of socialprocesses on the development of the personality. Hedescribed eight stages of the life cycle during which in-dividuals struggle with developmental \"crises.\" Specifictasks associated with each stage must be completed forresolution of the crisis and for emotional growth toCHAPTER 3 Theoretical Models of Personality Development 33 TABLE 3-2 Stages of Development in Sullivan's Interpersonal Theory AGE STAGE MAJOR DEVELOPMENTAL TASKS Birth-18 months 18 months-6 years 6-9 years 9-12 years 12-14 years 14-21 yearsRelief from anxiety through oral gratification of needs Learning to experience a delay in personal gratification without undue anxiety Learning to form satisfactory peer relationshipsLearning to form satisfactory relationships with persons of same gender; initiating feelings of affection for another person Learning to form satisfactory relationships with persons of the oppo- site gender; developing a sense of identity Establishing self-identity; experiencing satisfying relationships; work- ing to develop a Early adolescenceLate An outline of Erikson's stages of psychosocial development is presented in Table 3-3. Erikson's Stages of Personality Development Trust versus Mistrust: Birth to 18 Months Major Developmental Task From birth to 18 months, the major task is to develop a basic trust in the mothering figure and learn to gen-eralize it to others. Achievement of the task results in self-confidence,optimism, faith in the gratification of needs and de-sires, and hope for the future. The infant learns totrust when basic needs are met consistently. Nonachievement results in emotional dissatisfac-tion with the self and others, suspiciousness, anddifficulty with interpersonal relationships. The taskremains unresolved when primary caregivers fail torespond to the infant's distress signal promptly andconsistently. Autonomy versus Shame and Doubt: 18 Months to 3 Years Major Developmental Task The major task during the ages of 18 months to 3 years is to gain some self-control and independence withinthe environment. Achievement of the task results in a sense of self-control and the ability to delay gratification, and afeeling of self-confidence in one's ability to per-form. Autonomy is achieved when parents encour-age and provide opportunities for independentactivities. Nonachievement results in a lack of self-confidence,a lack of pride in the ability to perform, a sense ofbeing controlled by others, and a rage against theself. The task remains unresolved when primarycaregivers restrict independent behaviors, bothphysically and verbally, or set the child up for failurewith unrealistic expectations. Initiative versus Guilt: 3 to 6 Years Major Developmental Task During the ages of 3 to 6 years the goal is to developa sense of purpose and the ability to initiate and direct one's own activities. Achievement of the task results in the ability to exercise restraint and self-control of inappropri-ate social behaviors. Assertiveness and depend-ability increase, and the child enjoys learning andpersonal achievement. The conscience develops,thereby controlling the impulsive behaviors of theid. Initiative is achieved when creativity is encour-aged and performance is recognized and posi-tively reinforced. Nonachievement results in feelings of inadequacyand a sense of defeat. Guilt is experienced to an ex-cessive degree, even to the point of accepting liabil-ity in situations for which one is not responsible. The34 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing TABLE 3-3 Stages of Development in Erikson's Psychosocial Theory AGE STAGE MAJOR DEVELOPMENTAL TASKS Infancy (Birth-1 8 months) Early childhood (18 months-3 years) Late childhood (3-6 years) School age (6-12 years) Adolescence (12-20 years) Young adulthood (20-30 years) Adulthood (30-65 years) Old age (65 years-death)To develop a basic trust in the mothering figure and learn to generalize it to others To gain some self-control and independence within the environment To develop a sense of purpose and the ability to initiate and direct own activities To achieve a sense of self-confidence by learning, competing, performing successfully, and receiving recognition from significant others, peers, and acquaintances To integrate the tasks mastered in the previous stages into a secure sense of self To form an intense, lasting relationship or a commitment to another person, cause, institution, or creative effort To achieve the life goals established for oneself, while also consider- ing the welfare of future generations To review one's life and derive meaning from both positive and negative events, while achieving a positive sense of self-worthTrust vs. mistrust Autonomy vs. shame and doubt Initiative vs. guiltIndustry vs. inferiority Identity vs. role confusion Intimacy vs. isolation Generativity vs. stagnation Ego integrity vs. despair4092_Ch03_027-046 25/07/14 10:23 AM Page 34child may view him- or herself as evil and deserv- ing of punishment. The task remains unresolvedwhen creativity is stifled and parents continuallyexpect a higher level of achievement than thechild produces. Industry versus Inferiority: 6 to 12 Years Major Developmental Task The major task for 6- to 12-year-olds is to achieve asense of self-confidence by learning, competing, per-forming successfully, and receiving recognition fromsignificant others, peers, and acquaintances. Achievement of the task results in a sense of satisfaction and pleasure in the interaction andinvolvement with others. The individual mastersreliable work habits and develops attitudes of trustworthiness. He or she is conscientious,feels pride in achievement, and enjoys play butdesires a balance between fantasy and \"realworld\" activities. Industry is achieved when en-couragement is given to activities and responsi-bilities in the school and community, as well asthose within the home, and recognition is givenfor accomplishments. Nonachievement results in difficulty in interper-sonal relationships because of feelings of per-sonal inadequacy. The individual can neithercooperate and compromise with others in groupactivities nor problem solve or complete tasks suc-cessfully. He or she may become either passiveand meek or overly aggressive to cover up forfeelings of inadequacy. If this occurs, the individ-ual may manipulate or violate the rights of othersto satisfy his or her own needs or desires; he orshe may become a workaholic with unrealistic expectations for personal achievement. This taskremains unresolved when parents set unrealisticexpectations for the child, when discipline isharsh and tends to impair self-esteem, and whenaccomplishments are consistently met with nega-tive feedback. Identity versus Role Confusion: 12 to 20 Years Major Developmental Task At 12 to 20 years, the goal is to integrate the tasks mas-tered in the previous stages into a secure sense of self. Achievement of the task results in a sense of confi-dence, emotional stability, and a view of the self asa unique individual. Commitments are made to avalue system, to the choice of a career, and to rela-tionships with members of both genders. Identityis achieved when adolescents are allowed to expe-rience independence by making decisions that in-fluence their lives. Parents should be available tooffer support when needed but should graduallyrelinquish control to the maturing individual in aneffort to encourage the development of an inde-pendent sense of self. Nonachievement results in a sense of self-consciousness, doubt, and confusion about one'srole in life. Personal values or goals for one's life are absent. Long-term commitments to rela-tionships with others are nonexistent. A lack of self-confidence is often expressed by delin-quent and rebellious behavior. Entering adult-hood, with its accompanying responsibilities, maybe an underlying fear. This task can remain unresolved for many reasons. Examples includethe following: When independence is discouraged by the parents and the adolescent is nurtured in the dependent position When discipline within the home has been overlyharsh, inconsistent, or absent When there has been parental rejection or frequent shifting of parental figures Intimacy versus Isolation: 20 to 30 Years Major Developmental Task The objective for 20- to 30-year-olds is to form an in-tense, lasting relationship or a commitment to anotherperson, a cause, an institution, or a creative effort(Murray, Zentner, & Yakimo, 2009). Achievement of the task results in the capacity formutual love and respect between two people andthe ability of an individual to pledge a total com-mitment to another. The intimacy goes far beyondthe sexual contact between two people. It de-scribes a commitment in which personal sacrificesare made for another, whether it be another per-son or, if one chooses, a career or other type ofcause or endeavor to which an individual elects todevote his or her life. Intimacy is achieved whenan individual has developed the capacity for giv-ing of oneself to another. This is learned whenone has been the recipient of this type of givingwithin the family unit. Nonachievement results in withdrawal, social iso-lation, and aloneness. The individual is unable toform lasting, intimate relationships, often seekingintimacy through numerous superficial sexualcontacts. No career is established; he or she mayhave a history of occupational changes (or mayfear change and thus remain in an undesirable jobsituation). The task remains unresolved when lovein the home has been deprived or distortedthrough the younger years (Murray et al., 2009).One fails to achieve the ability to give of the selfwithout having been the recipient early on fromprimary caregivers.CHAPTER 3 Theoretical Models of Personality Development 354092_Ch03_027-046 25/07/14 10:23 AM Page 35Generativity versus Stagnation or Self-Absorption: 30 to 65 Years Major Developmental Task The major task at this stage is to achieve the life goals established for oneself while also considering the welfare of future generations. Achievement of the task results in a sense of grati-fication from personal and professional achieve-ments and from meaningful contributions toothers. The individual is active in the service of andto society. Generativity is achieved when the indi-vidual expresses satisfaction with this stage in lifeand demonstrates responsibility for leaving theworld a better place in which to live. Nonachievement results in lack of concern forthe welfare of others and total preoccupationwith the self. He or she becomes withdrawn, iso-lated, and highly self-indulgent, with no capacityfor giving of the self to others. The task remainsunresolved when earlier developmental tasks arenot fulfilled and the individual does not achievethe degree of maturity required to derive gratifi-cation out of a personal concern for the welfareof others. Ego Integrity versus Despair: 65 Years to Death Major Developmental Task Between the age of 65 years and death, the goal is toreview one's life and derive meaning from both posi-tive and negative events, while achieving a positivesense of self. Achievement of the task results in a sense of self-worth and self-acceptance as one reviews lifegoals, accepting that some were achieved andsome were not. The individual derives a sense ofdignity from his or her life experiences and doesnot fear death, rather viewing it as another stageof development. Ego integrity is achieved whenindividuals have successfully completed the devel-opmental tasks of the other stages and have littledesire to make major changes in how their liveshave progressed. Nonachievement results in a sense of self-con-tempt and disgust with how life has progressed.The individual would like to start over and havea second chance at life. He or she feels worthlessand helpless to change. Anger, depression, andloneliness are evident. The focus may be on pastfailures or perceived failures. Impending death isfeared or denied, or ideas of suicide may prevail.The task remains unresolved when earlier tasksare not fulfilled: self-confidence, a concern forothers, and a strong sense of self-identity werenever achieved.Relevance of Psychosocial Development Theory to Nursing Practice Erikson's theory is particularly relevant to nursing practice in that it incorporates sociocultural conceptsinto the development of personality. Erikson providesa systematic, stepwise approach and outlines specifictasks that should be completed during each stage.This information can be used quite readily in psychi-atric/mental health nursing. Many individuals withmental health problems are still struggling to achievetasks from a number of developmental stages. Nursescan plan care to assist these individuals to fulfill thesetasks and move on to a higher developmental level. CLINICAL PEARL During assessment, nurses can determine if a client is experiencing difficulties associated with specific lifetasks as described by Erikson. Knowledge about a client's devel-opmental level, along with other assessment data, can help to identify accurate nursing interventions. Theory of Object Relations Margaret Mahler (Mahler, Pine, & Bergman, 1975) formulated a theory that describes the separation-individuation process of the infant from the maternalfigure (primary caregiver). She describes this processas progressing through three major phases, and shefurther delineates phase III, the separation-individu-ation phase, into four subphases. Mahler's develop-mental theory is outlined in Table 3-4. Phase I: The Autistic Phase (Birth to 1 Month) In the autistic phase, also called normal autism , the in- fant exists in a half-sleeping, half-waking state and does not perceive the existence of other people or anexternal environment. The fulfillment of basic needsfor survival and comfort is the focus and is merely ac-cepted as it occurs. Phase II: The Symbiotic Phase (1 to 5 Months) Symbiosis is a type of \"psychic fusion\" of mother and child. The child views the self as an extension of the mother, but with a developing awareness that it is shewho fulfills the child's every need. Mahler suggestedthat absence of, or rejection by, the maternal figureat this phase can lead to symbiotic psychosis. Phase III: Separation-Individuation (5 to 36 Months) This third phase represents what Mahler calls the \"psychological birth\" of the child. Separation is defined as the physical and psychological attainment of a36 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing4092_Ch03_027-046 25/07/14 10:23 AM Page 36sense of personal distinction from the mothering figure. Individuation occurs with a strengthening of the ego and an acceptance of a sense of \"self,\" withindependent ego boundaries. Four subphasesthrough which the child evolves in his or her progres-sion from a symbiotic extension of the mothering figure to a distinct and separate being are described. Subphase 1: Differentiation (5 to 10 Months) The differentiation phase begins with the child's initialphysical movements away from the mothering figure.A primary recognition of separateness commences. Subphase 2: Practicing (10 to 16 Months) With advanced locomotor functioning, the child experiences feelings of exhilaration from increasedindependence. He or she is now able to move awayfrom, and return to, the mothering figure. A sense ofomnipotence is manifested. Subphase 3: Rapprochement (16 to 24 Months) This third subphase, rapprochement, is extremelycritical to the child's healthy ego development. Dur-ing this time, the child becomes increasingly awareof his or her separateness from the mothering figure,while the sense of fearlessness and omnipotence di-minishes. The child, now recognizing the mother asa separate individual, wishes to reestablish closenesswith her but shuns the total re-engulfment of thesymbiotic stage. The need is for the mothering figureto be available to provide \"emotional refueling\" ondemand. Critical to this subphase is the mothering figure's response to the child. If the mothering figure isavailable to fulfill emotional needs as they arise, thechild develops a sense of security in the knowledgethat he or she is loved and will not be abandoned.However, if emotional needs are inconsistently metor if the mother rewards clinging, dependent behav-iors and withholds nurturing when the childdemonstrates independence, feelings of rage and afear of abandonment develop and often persist intoadulthood. Subphase 4: Consolidation (24 to 36 Months) With achievement of the consolidation subphase, adefinite individuality and sense of separateness of selfare established. Objects are represented as whole,with the child having the ability to integrate both\"good\" and \"bad.\" A degree of object constancy is established as the child is able to internalize a sus-tained image of the mothering figure as enduringand loving, while maintaining the perception of heras a separate person in the outside world. Relevance of Object Relations Theory to Nursing Practice Understanding of the concepts of Mahler's theory of object relations helps the nurse assess the client's level ofindividuation from primary caregivers. The emotionalproblems of many individuals can be traced to lack of fulfillment of the tasks of separation/individuation. Examples include problems related to dependencyand excessive anxiety. The individual with borderlinepersonality disorders is thought to be fixed in the rap-prochement phase of development, harboring fearsof abandonment and underlying rage. This knowl-edge is important in the provision of nursing care tothese individuals.CHAPTER 3 Theoretical Models of Personality Development 37 TABLE 3-4 Stages of Development in Mahler's Theory of Object Relations AGE PHASE/SUBPHASE MAJOR DEVELOPMENTAL TASKS Birth-1 month 1-5 months 5-10 months 10-16 months 16-24 months 24-36 monthsFulfillment of basic needs for survival and comfort Development of awareness of external source of need fulfillment Commencement of a primary recognition of separateness from the mothering figure Increased independence through locomotor functioning; increased sense of separateness of self Acute awareness of separateness of self; learning to seek \"emotional refueling\" from mothering figure to maintain feeling of security Sense of separateness established; on the way to object constancy (i.e., able to internalize a sustained image of loved object/person when it is out of sight); resolution of separation anxietyI. Normal autism II. Piaget (Piaget & Inhelder, 1969) has been called the father of child psychology. His work concerningcognitive development in children is based on the premise that human intelligence is an extension ofbiological adaptation, or one's ability to adapt psycho-logically to the environment. He believed that humanintelligence progresses through a series of stages thatare related to age, demonstrating at each successivestage a higher level of logical organization than at theprevious stages. From his extensive studies of cognitive develop- ment in children, Piaget discovered four major stages,each of which he believed to be a necessary prerequi-site for the one that follows. An outline is presentedin Table 3-5. Stage 1: Sensorimotor (Birth to 2 Years) At the beginning of his or her life, the child is con-cerned only with satisfying basic needs and comforts.The self is not differentiated from the external envi-ronment. As the sense of differentiation occurs, withincreasing mobility and awareness, the mental systemis expanded. The child develops a greater understand-ing regarding objects within the external environmentand their effects upon him or her. Knowledge isgained regarding the ability to manipulate objects andexperiences within the environment. The sense of object permanence\u2014the notion that an object will continue to exist when it is no longer present to thesenses\u2014is initiated. Stage 2: Preoperational (2 to 6 years) Piaget believed that preoperational thought is char-acterized by egocentrism. Personal experiences arethought to be universal, and the child is unable to accept the differing viewpoints of others. Languagedevelopment progresses, as does the ability to attributespecial meaning to symbolic gestures (e.g., bringing astorybook to mother is a symbolic invitation to have astory read). Reality is often given to inanimate objects.Object permanence culminates in the ability to con-jure up mental representations of objects or people. Stage 3: Concrete Operations (6 to 12 Years) The ability to apply logic to thinking begins in this stage; however, \"concreteness\" still predominates. Anunderstanding of the concepts of reversibility and spatiality is developed. For example, the child recog-nizes that changing the shape of objects does not necessarily change the amount, weight, volume, orthe ability of the object to return to its original form.Another achievement of this stage is the ability to clas-sify objects by any of their several characteristics. Forexample, he or she can classify all poodles as dogs butrecognizes that all dogs are not poodles. The concept of a lawful self is developed at this stage as the child becomes more socialized and rule con-scious. Egocentrism decreases, the ability to cooperatein interactions with other children increases, and un-derstanding and acceptance of established rules grow. Stage 4: Formal Operations (12 to 15+ Years) At this stage, the individual is able to think and reason in abstract terms. He or she can make and test hy-potheses using logical and orderly problem solving.Current situations and reflections of the future areidealized, and a degree of egocentrism returns duringthis stage. There may be some difficulty reconcilingidealistic hopes with more rational prospects. Formaloperations, however, enable individuals to distinguish38 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing TABLE 3-5 Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development AGE STAGE MAJOR DEVELOPMENTAL TASKS Birth-2 years 2-6 years 6-12 years 12-15+ yearsWith increased mobility and awareness, development of a sense of self as separate from the external environment; the concept of object permanence emerges as the ability to form mental imagesevolves Learning to express self with language; development of understand- ing of symbolic gestures; achievement of object permanence Learning to apply logic to thinking; development of understanding of reversibility and spatiality; learning to differentiate and classify; increased socialization and application of rules Learning to think and reason in abstract terms; making and testing hypotheses; capability of logical thinking and reasoning expandand are refined; cognitive maturity achievedSensorimotor Preoperational Concrete operations Formal operations4092_Ch03_027-046 25/07/14 10:23 AM Page the ideal and the real. Piaget's theory sug- gests that most individuals achieve cognitive maturity, the capability to perform all mental operationsneeded for adulthood, in middle to late adolescence. Relevance of Cognitive Development Theory to Nursing Practice Nurses who work in psychiatry are likely to be in- volved in helping clients, particularly depressedclients, with techniques of cognitive therapy. In cog-nitive therapy, the individual is taught to controlthought distortions that are considered to be a factorin the development and maintenance of mood disor-ders. In the cognitive model, depression is character-ized by a triad of negative distortions related toexpectations of the environment, self, and future. Inthis model, depression is viewed as a distortion in cog-nitive development, the self is unrealistically deval-ued, and the future is perceived as hopeless. Therapyfocuses on changing \"automatic thoughts\" that occurspontaneously and contribute to the distorted affect.Nurses who assist with this type of therapy must haveknowledge of how cognition develops in order tohelp clients identify the distorted thought patternsand make the changes required for improvement inaffective functioning (see Chapter 19). Theory of Moral Development Lawrence Kohlberg's (1976) stages of moral devel-opment are not closely tied to specific age groups.Research was conducted with males ranging in age from 10 to 28 years. Kohlberg believed that each stage is necessary and basic to the next stageand that all individuals must progress through each stage sequentially. He defined three major levels of moral development, each of which is further subdivided into two stages. An outline ofKohlberg's developmental stages is presented inTable 3-6. Most people do not progress through allsix stages. Level I: Preconventional Level (Prominent from Ages 4 to 10 Years) Stage 1: Punishment and Obedience Orientation At the punishment and obedience orientation stage, the individual is responsive to cultural guidelines ofgood or bad and right or wrong, but primarily interms of the known related consequences. Fear ofpunishment is likely to be the incentive for conform-ity (e.g., \"I'll do it, because if I don't I can't watch TVfor a week\"). Stage 2: Instrumental Relativist Orientation Behaviors at the instrumental relativist orientationstage are guided by egocentrism and concern forself. There is an intense desire to satisfy one's ownneeds, but occasionally the needs of others are con-sidered. For the most part, decisions are based onpersonal benefits derived (e.g., \"I'll do it if I getsomething in return,\" or occasionally, \". . . becauseyou asked me to\").CHAPTER 3 Theoretical Models of Personality Development 39 TABLE 3-6 Kohlberg's Stages of Moral Development LEVEL/AGE* STAGE DEVELOPMENTAL FOCUS I. Preconventional (common from age 4-1 0 years) II. Conventional (common from age 10-13 years, and into adulthood) III. Postconventional (can occur from adolescence on) *Ages in Kohlberg's theory are not well defined. The stage of development is determined by the motivation behind the individual 's behavior.Behavior motivated by fear of punishment Behavior motivated by egocentrism and concern for self Behavior motivated by expectations of others; strong desire for approval and acceptance Behavior motivated by respect for authorityBehavior motivated by respect for universal laws and moral principles; guided by internal set of values Behavior motivated by internalized principles of honor, justice, and respect for human dignity; guided by the conscience1. Punishment and obe- dience orientation 2. Instrumental relativist orientation 3. Interpersonal concor- dance orientation 4. Law and order orientation 5. Social contract legalis- tic orientation 6. Universal ethical principle orientation4092_Ch03_027-046 25/07/14 10:23 AM Page 39Level II: Conventional Level (Prominent From Ages 10 to 13 Years and IntoAdulthood)* Stage 3: Interpersonal Concordance Orientation Behavior at the interpersonal concordance orienta- tion stage is guided by the expectations of others. Approval and acceptance within one's societal groupprovide the incentive to conform (e.g., \"I'll do it because you asked me to,\" \". . . because it will helpyou,\" or \". . . because it will please you\"). Stage 4: Law and Order Orientation In the law and order orientation stage, there is a personal respect for authority. Rules and laws arerequired and override personal principles andgroup mores. The belief is that all individuals andgroups are subject to the same code of order, andno one shall be exempt (e.g., \"I'll do it because it isthe law\"). Level III: Postconventional Level (Can Occur From Adolescence Onward) Stage 5: Social Contract Legalistic Orientation Individuals who reach stage 5 have developed a sys- tem of values and principles that determine for themwhat is right or wrong; behaviors are acceptablyguided by this value system, provided they do not vi-olate the human rights of others. They believe that allindividuals are entitled to certain inherent humanrights, and they live according to universal laws andprinciples. However, they hold the idea that the lawsare subject to scrutiny and change as needs within so-ciety evolve and change (e.g., \"I'll do it because it isthe moral and legal thing to do, even though it is notmy personal choice\"). Stage 6: Universal Ethical Principle Orientation Behavior at stage 6 is directed by internalized princi-ples of honor, justice, and respect for human dignity.Laws are abstract and unwritten, such as the \"GoldenRule,\" \"equality of human rights,\" and \"justice for all.\"They are not the concrete rules established by society.The conscience is the guide, and when one fails tomeet the self-expected behaviors, the personal conse-quence is intense guilt. The allegiance to these ethicalprinciples is so strong that the individual will stand bythem even knowing that negative consequences willresult (e.g., \"I'll do it because I believe it is the rightthing to do, even though it is illegal and I will be imprisoned for doing it\").Relevance of Moral Development Theory to Nursing Practice Moral development has relevance to psychiatric nurs- ing in that it affects critical thinking about how indi-viduals ought to behave and treat others. Moralbehavior reflects the way a person interprets basic re-spect for other persons, such as the respect for humanlife, freedom, justice, or confidentiality. Psychiatricnurses must be able to assess the level of moral devel-opment of their clients in order to be able to helpthem in their effort to advance in their progression to-ward a higher level of developmental maturity. A Nursing Model\u2014Hildegard E. Peplau Peplau (1991) applied interpersonal theory to nurs-ing practice and, most specifically, to nurse-client relationship development. She provided a frameworkfor \"psychodynamic nursing,\" the interpersonal in-volvement of the nurse with a client in a given nursingsituation. Peplau stated, \"Nursing is helpful whenboth the patient and the nurse grow as a result of thelearning that occurs in the nursing situation\" (p. ix). Peplau correlated the stages of personality devel- opment in childhood to stages through which clientsadvance during the progression of an illness. She alsoviewed these interpersonal experiences as learning sit-uations for nurses to facilitate forward movement inthe development of personality. She believed thatwhen there is fulfillment of psychological tasks asso-ciated with the nurse-client relationship, the person-alities of both can be strengthened. Key conceptsinclude the following: Nursing is a human relationship between an indi- vidual who is sick, or in need of health services, anda nurse especially educated to recognize and to re-spond to the need for help. Psychodynamic nursing is being able to under- stand one's own behavior, to help others identifyfelt difficulties, and to apply principles of humanrelations to the problems that arise at all levels ofexperience. Roles are sets of values and behaviors that are spe- cific to functional positions within social structures.Peplau identifies the following nursing roles: A stranger. A nurse is at first a stranger to the client. The client is also a stranger to the nurse.Peplau (1991) stated: Respect and positive interest accorded a stranger is at first nonpersonal and includes the same ordinary cour-tesies that are accorded to a new guest who has beenbrought into any situation. This principle implies: (1) accepting the patient as he is; (2) treating the patient as an emotionally able stranger and relating40 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing *Eighty percent of adults are fixed in level II, with a majority of women in stage 3 and a majority of men in stage 4.4092_Ch03_027-046 25/07/14 10:23 AM Page 40to him on this basis until evidence shows him to be otherwise. (p. 44) Aresource person is one who provides specific, needed information that helps the client understand his or her problem and the new situation. A counselor is one who listens as the client reviews feelings related to difficulties he or sheis experiencing in any aspect of life. \"Interper-sonal techniques\" have been identified to facili-tate the nurse's interaction in the process ofhelping the client solve problems and make decisions concerning these difficulties. A teacher is one who identifies learning needs and provides information to the client or family thatmay aid in improvement of the life situation. A leader is one who directs the nurse-client inter- action and ensures that appropriate actions are undertaken to facilitate achievement of thedesignated goals. A technical expert is one who understands vari- ous professional devices and possesses the clini-cal skills necessary to perform the interventionsthat are in the best interest of the client. A surrogate is one who serves as a substitute figure for another. Phases of the nurse-client relationship are stages of over- lapping roles or functions in relation to health prob-lems, during which the nurse and client learn to workcooperatively to resolve difficulties. Peplau identifiedfour phases: Orientation is the phase during which the client, nurse, and family work together to recognize, clar-ify, and define the existing problem. Identification is the phase after which the client's ini- tial impression has been clarified and when he orshe begins to respond selectively to those who seemto offer the help that is needed. Clients may respondin one of three ways: (1) on the basis of participationor interdependent relations with the nurse, (2) onthe basis of independence or isolation from thenurse, or (3) on the basis of helplessness or depend-ence on the nurse (Peplau, 1991). Exploitation is the phase during which the client proceeds to take full advantage of the services offered to him or her. Having learned which serv-ices are available, feeling comfortable within thesetting, and serving as an active participant in hisor her own health care, the client exploits the services available and explores all possibilities ofthe changing situation. Resolution occurs when the client is freed from identification with helping persons and gathersstrength to assume independence. Resolution isthe direct result of successful completion of theother three phases. Peplau's Stages of Personality Development Psychological tasks are developmental lessons that must be learned on the way to achieving maturity of the personality. Peplau (1991) identified four psy-chological tasks that she associated with the stagesof infancy and childhood described by Freud andSullivan. She stated: When psychological tasks are successfully learned at each era of development, biological capacities are usedproductively and relations with people lead to produc-tive living. When they are not successfully learned theycarry over into adulthood and attempts at learningcontinue in devious ways, more or less impeded byconventional adaptations that provide a superstructureover the baseline of actual learning. (p. 166) In the context of nursing, Peplau (1991) related these four psychological tasks to the demands made on nurses in their relations with clients. She main-tained that: Nursing can function as a maturing force in society. Since illness is an event that is experienced along withfeelings that derive from older experiences but arereenacted in the relationship of nurse to patient, thenurse-patient relationship is seen as an opportunityfor nurses to help patients to complete the unfin-ished psychological tasks of childhood in some degree. (p. 159) Peplau's psychological tasks of personality develop- ment include the four stages outlined in the following paragraphs. An outline of the stages of personality de-velopment according to Peplau's theory is presentedin Table 3-7. Learning to Count on Others Nurses and clients first come together as strangers.Both bring to the relationship certain \"raw materials,\"such as inherited biological components, personalitycharacteristics (temperament), individual intellectualcapacity, and specific cultural or environmental influ-ences. Peplau relates these to the same \"raw materi-als\" with which an infant comes into this world. Thenewborn is capable of experiencing comfort and dis- comfort. He or she soon learns to communicate feel-ings in a way that results in the fulfillment of comfortneeds by the mothering figure who provides love andcare unconditionally. However, fulfillment of thesedependency needs is inhibited when goals of themothering figure become the focus, and love andcare are contingent on meeting the needs of the care-giver rather than the infant.CHAPTER 3 Theoretical Models of Personality Development 414092_Ch03_027-046 25/07/14 10:23 AM Page 41Clients with unmet dependency needs regress dur- ing illness and demonstrate behaviors that relate to this stage of development. Other clients regress to thislevel because of physical disabilities associated withtheir illness. Peplau believed that when nurses pro-vide unconditional care, they help these clientsprogress toward more mature levels of functioning.This may involve the role of \"surrogate mother,\" inwhich the nurse fulfills needs for the client with theintent of helping him or her grow, mature, and become more independent. Learning to Delay Satisfaction Peplau related this stage to that of toddlerhood, orthe first step in the development of interdependentsocial relations. Psychosexually, it is compared to theanal stage of development, when a child learns that,because of cultural mores, he or she cannot emptythe bowels for relief of discomfort at will, but mustdelay to use the toilet, which is considered more cul-turally acceptable. When toilet training occurs tooearly or is very rigid, or when appropriate behavior isset forth as a condition for love and caring, tasks as-sociated with this stage remain unfulfilled. The childfeels powerless and fails to learn the satisfaction ofpleasing others by delaying self-gratification in smallways. He or she may also exhibit rebellious behaviorby failing to comply with demands of the motheringfigure in an effort to counter the feelings of power-lessness. The child may accomplish this by withhold-ing the fecal product or failing to deposit it in theculturally acceptable manner. Peplau cited Fromm (1949) in describing the fol- lowing potential behaviors of individuals who havefailed to complete the tasks of the second stage of development: Exploitation and manipulation of others to satisfytheir own desires because they are unable to do soindependentlySuspiciousness and envy of others; directing hostil-ity toward others in an effort to enhance their ownself-image Hoarding and withholding possessions from others;miserliness Inordinate neatness and punctuality Inability to relate to others through sharing of feel-ings, ideas, or experiences Ability to vary the personality characteristics tothose required to satisfy personal desires at anygiven time When nurses observe these types of behaviors in clients, it is important to encourage full expressionand to convey unconditional acceptance. When theclient learns to feel safe and unconditionally ac-cepted, he or she is more likely to let go of the oppo-sitional behavior and advance in the developmentalprogression. Peplau (1991) stated: Nurses who aid patients to feel safe and secure, so that wants can be expressed and satisfaction eventu-ally achieved, also help them to strengthen personalpower that is needed for productive social activities.(p. 207) Identifying Oneself \"A concept of self develops as a product of interaction with adults\" (Peplau, 1991, p. 211). A child learns tostructure self-concept by observing how others interactwith him or her. Roles and behaviors are establishedout of the child's perception of the expectations ofothers. When children perceive that adults expectthem to maintain more-or-less permanent roles as in-fants, they perceive themselves as helpless and de-pendent. When the perceived expectation is that thechild must behave in a manner beyond his or her mat-urational level, the child is deprived of the fulfillmentof emotional and growth needs at the lower levels ofdevelopment. Children who are given freedom to re-spond to situations and experiences unconditionally42 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing TABLE 3-7 Stages of Development in Peplau's Interpersonal Theory AGE STAGE MAJOR DEVELOPMENTAL TASKS Infancy Toddlerhood Early childhood Late childhoodLearning to communicate in various ways with the primary caregiver in order to have comfort needs fulfilled Learning the satisfaction of pleasing others by delaying self-gratification in small ways Learning appropriate roles and behaviors by acquiring the ability to perceive the expectations of others Learning the skills of compromise, competition, and cooperation with others; establishment of a more realistic view of the world and a feeling of one's place in itLearning to count on others Learning to delay satisfaction Identifying oneself Developing skills in participation4092_Ch03_027-046 25/07/14 10:23 AM Page 42(i.e., with behaviors that are appropriate to their feel- ings) learn to improve on and reconstruct behavioralresponses at their own individual pace. Peplau (1991)stated, \"The ways in which adults appraise the childand the way he functions in relation to his experiencesand perceptions are taken in or introjected and become the child's view of himself\" (p. 213). In nursing, it is important for the nurse to recog- nize cues that communicate how the client feelsabout him- or herself and about the presenting med-ical problem. In the initial interaction, it is difficultfor the nurse to perceive the \"wholeness\" of the client,because the focus is on the condition that has causedhim or her to seek help. Likewise, it is difficult for theclient to perceive the nurse as a \"mother (or father)\"or \"somebody's wife (or husband)\" or as having a lifeaside from being there to offer assistance with the immediate presenting problem. As the relationshipdevelops, nurses must be able to recognize client behaviors that indicate unfulfilled needs and provideexperiences that promote growth. For example, theclient who very proudly announces that she has com-pleted activities of daily living independently andwants the nurse to come and inspect her room maystill be craving the positive reinforcement associatedwith lower levels of development. Nurses must also be aware of the predisposing fac- tors that they bring to the relationship. Attitudes andbeliefs about certain issues can have a deleterious ef-fect on the client and interfere not only with the ther-apeutic relationship but also with the client's abilityfor growth and development. For example, a nursewho has strong beliefs against abortion may treat aclient who has just undergone an abortion with dis-approval and disrespect. The nurse may respond inthis manner without even realizing he or she is doingso. Attitudes and values are introjected during earlydevelopment and can be integrated so completely asto become a part of the self-system. Nurses must haveknowledge and appreciation of their own concept ofself in order to develop the flexibility required to ac-cept all clients as they are, unconditionally. Effectiveresolution of problems that arise in the interdepend-ent relationship can be the means for both client and nurse to reinforce positive personality traits andmodify those more negative views of self. Developing Skills in Participation Peplau cited Sullivan's (1953) description of the \"juvenile\" stage of personality development (ages 6through 9). During this stage, the child develops thecapacity to \"compromise, compete, and cooperate\"with others. These skills are considered basic to one's ability to participate collaboratively with others.If a child tries to use the skills of an earlier level of development (e.g., crying, whining, demanding), heor she may be rejected by peers of this juvenile stage.As this stage progresses, children begin to view them-selves through the eyes of their peers. Sullivan (1953)called this \"consensual validation.\" Preadolescentstake on a more realistic view of the world and a feel-ing of their place in it. The capacity to love others (besides the mother figure) develops at this time andis expressed in relation to one's self-acceptance. Failure to develop appropriate skills at any point along the developmental progression results in an in-dividual's difficulty with participation in confrontingthe recurring problems of life. It is not the responsi-bility of the nurse to teach solutions to problems, butrather to help clients improve their problem-solvingskills so that they may achieve their own resolution.This is accomplished through development of theskills of competition, compromise, cooperation, con-sensual validation, and love of self and others. Nursescan assist clients to develop or refine these skills byhelping them to identify the problem, define a goal,and take the responsibility for performing the actionsnecessary to reach that goal. Peplau (1991) stated: Participation is required by a democratic society. When it has not been learned in earlier experiences,nurses have an opportunity to facilitate learning inthe present and thus to aid in the promotion of ademocratic society. (p. 259) Relevance of Peplau's Model to Nursing Practice Peplau's model provides nurses with a framework to interact with clients, many of whom are fixed in\u2014orbecause of illness have regressed to\u2014an earlier level ofdevelopment. She suggested roles that nurses may as-sume to assist clients to progress, thereby achieving orresuming their appropriate developmental level. Ap-propriate developmental progression arms the individ-ual with the ability to confront the recurring problemsof life. Nurses serve to facilitate learning of that whichhas not been learned in earlier experiences. Summary and Key Points Growth and development are unique with each in-dividual and continue throughout the life span. Personality is defined as the combination of char-acter, behavioral, temperamental, emotional, andmental traits that are unique to each specific individual. Sigmund Freud, who has been called the father ofpsychiatry, believed the basic character has beenformed by the age of 5. Freud's personality theory can be conceptualized ac-cording to structure and dynamics of the personality,CHAPTER 3 Theoretical Models of Personality Development 434092_Ch03_027-046 25/07/14 10:23 AM Page 4344 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing topography of the mind, and stages of personality development. Freud's structure of the personality includes the id,ego, and superego. Freud classified all mental contents and operationsinto three categories: the conscious, the precon-scious, and the unconscious. Harry Stack Sullivan, author of the Interpersonal The- ory of Psychiatry, believed that individual behaviorand personality development are the direct resultof interpersonal relationships. Major concepts include anxiety, satisfaction of needs, interpersonal security, and self-system. Erik Erikson studied the influence of socialprocesses on the development of the personality. Erikson described eight stages of the life cycle frombirth to death. He believed that individuals strug-gled with developmental \"crises,\" and that eachmust be resolved for emotional growth to occur. Margaret Mahler formulated a theory that describesthe separation-individuation process of the infantfrom the maternal figure (primary caregiver).Stages of development describe the progression of the child from birth to object constancy at age 36 months. Jean Piaget has been called the father of child psychology. He believed that human intelligenceprogresses through a series of stages that are re-lated to age, demonstrating at each successive stagea higher level of logical organization than at theprevious stages. Lawrence Kohlberg outlined stages of moral devel-opment. His stages are not closely tied to specific agegroups or the maturational process. He believedthat moral stages emerge out of our own thinkingand the stimulation of our mental processes. Hildegard Peplau provided a framework for \"psy-chodynamic nursing,\" the interpersonal involve-ment of the nurse with a client in a given nursingsituation. Peplau identified the nursing roles of stranger, re-source person, counselor, teacher, leader, technicalexpert, and surrogate. Peplau described four psychological tasks that sheassociated with the stages of infancy and childhoodas identified by Freud and Sullivan. Peplau believed that nursing is helpful when boththe patient and the nurse grow as a result of thelearning that occurs in the nursing situation.

This \"neuroscientific revolution\" has placed anemphasis on the biological basis of behavior, and several mental illnesses are now being considered asphysical disorders that are the result of malfunctionsand/or malformations of the brain. This is not to imply that psychosocial and socio- cultural influences are totally discounted. Such a no-tion would negate the transactional model of stress/adaptation on which the framework of this textbookis conceptualized. The systems of biology, psychology, and sociol- ogy are not mutually exclusive\u2014they are interact-ing systems. This is clearly indicated by the fact that individuals experience biological changes in response to various environmental events. In-deed, each of these disciplines may be, at varioustimes, most appropriate for explaining behavioralphenomena. This chapter focuses on the role of neurophysiolog- ical, neurochemical, genetic, and endocrine influenceson psychiatric illness. A discussion of psychopharma-cology is included, and various diagnostic proceduresused to detect alteration in biological function thatmay contribute to psychiatric illness are identified. Theimplications for psychiatric/mental health nursing are discussed.The Nervous System: An Anatomical Review The Brain The brain has three major divisions, subdivided intosix major parts: l.Forebrain a. Cerebrum Pons b. Medulla c. Cerebellum Each of these structures is discussed individually. A summary is presented in Table 4-1. Cerebrum The cerebrum consists of a right and left hemisphereand constitutes the largest part of the human brain.CORE CONCEPT Psychobiology The study of the biological foundations of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes. TABLE 4-1 Structure and Function of the Brain STRUCTURE PRIMARY FUNCTION I. THE FOREBRAIN A. Cerebrum 1. Frontal lobes 2. P Hypothalamus3. Limbic systemComposed of two hemispheres separated by a deep groove that houses a band of 200 million neurons called the corpus callosum. The outer shell is called the cortex. It is extensively folded and consists of billions of neurons. The left hemisphere appears to deal with logic and solvingproblems. The right hemisphere may be called the \"creative\" brain and is associated with affect,behavior, and spatial-perceptual functions. Each hemisphere is divided into four lobes. Voluntary body movement, including movements that permit speaking, thinking and judgment formation, and expression of feelings. Perception and interpretation of most sensory in formation (including touch, pain, taste, and body position). Hearing, short-term memory, and sense of smell; expression of emotions through connection with limbic system. Visual reception and interpretation. Connects cerebrum with lower brain structures. Integrates all sensory input (except smell) on way to cortex; some involvement with emotions and mood. Regulates anterior and posterior lobes of pituitary gland; exerts control over actions of the autonomic nervous system; regulates appetite and temperature. Consists of medially placed cortical and subcortical structures and the fiber tracts connecting them with one another and with the hypothalamus. It is sometimes called the \"emotional brain\"\u2014associated with feelings of fear and anxiety; anger and aggression; love, joy, and hope; and withsexuality and social behavior.4092_Ch04_047-077 24/07/14 5:21 PM Page 48CHAPTER 4 Concepts of Psychobiology 49 The right and left hemispheres are connected by a deep groove, which houses a band of 200 million neu- rons (nerve cells) called the corpus callosum . Because each hemisphere controls different functions, informa-tion is processed through the corpus callosum so thateach hemisphere is aware of the activity of the other. The surface of the cerebrum consists of gray matter and is called the cerebral cortex. The gray matter is socalled because the neuron cell bodies of which it iscomposed look gray to the eye. These gray matter cellbodies are thought to be the actual thinking structuresof the brain. Another pair of masses of gray mattercalled basal ganglia is found deep within the cerebral hemispheres. They are responsible for certain subcon-scious aspects of voluntary movement, such as swingingthe arms when walking, gesturing while speaking, andregulating muscle tone (Scanlon & Sanders, 2011).The cerebral cortex is identified by numerous folds, called gyri, and deep grooves between the folds,called sulci. This extensive folding extends the surface area of the cerebral cortex, and thus permits the pres-ence of millions more neurons than would be possi-ble without it (as is the case in the brains of someanimals, such as dogs and cats). Each hemisphere ofthe cerebral cortex is divided into the frontal lobe,parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe.These for the overlying bonesin the cranium, are identified in Figure 4-1. The Frontal Lobes Voluntary body movement is controlled by the im-pulses through the frontal lobes. The right frontallobe controls motor activity on the left side of the bodyand the left frontal lobe controls motor activity on theTABLE 4-1 Structure and Function of the Brain\u2014cont'd STRUCTURE PRIMARY FUNCTION II.

Movements that permit speak- ing are also controlled by the frontal lobe, usually onlyon the left side (Scanlon & Sanders, 2011). Thefrontal lobe may also play a role in the emotional ex-perience, as evidenced by changes in mood and char-acter after damage to this area. The alterations includefear, aggressiveness, depression, rage, euphoria, irri-tability, and apathy and are likely related to a frontallobe connection to the limbic system. The frontal lobemay also be involved (indirectly through associationfibers linked to primary sensory areas) in thinking andperceptual interpretation of information. The Parietal Lobes Somatosensory input occurs in the parietal lobe area of the brain. These include touch, pain and pressure, taste, temperature, perception of joint andbody position, and visceral sensations. The parietallobes also contain association fibers linked to the primary sensory areas through which interpretationof sensory-perceptual information is made. Languageinterpretation is associated with the left hemisphereof the parietal lobe. The Temporal Lobes The upper anterior temporal lobe is concerned with auditory functions, while the lower part is dedicated toshort-term memory. The sense of smell has a connectionto the temporal lobes, as the impulses carried by theolfactory nerves end in this area of the brain. The temporal lobes also play a role in the expression ofemotions through an interconnection with the limbicsystem. The left temporal lobe, along with the left pari-etal lobe, is involved in language interpretation. The Occipital Lobes The occipital lobes are the primary area of visual re-ception and interpretation. Visual perception, whichgives individuals the ability to judge spatial relation-ships such as distance and to see in three dimensions,is also processed in this area. Language interpretationis influenced by the occipital lobes through an asso-ciation with the visual experience. Diencephalon The second part of the forebrain is the diencephalon,which connects the cerebrum with lower structures of the brain. The major components of the dien-cephalon include the thalamus, the hypothalamus,and the limbic system. These 4-2 4-3. Thalamus The thalamus integrates all sensory input (exceptsmell) on its way to the cortex. This helps the cerebralcortex interpret the whole picture very section of the brain as seen from the left side. This medial plane shows internal anatomy as well as the lobes of t he cerebrum. (From Scanlon, V.C., & Sanders, T. [2011]. Essentials of anatomy and physiology [6th ed.]. Philadelphia, PA: Davis Company, with permission.)4092_Ch04_047-077 24/07/14 5:21 PM Page 50CHAPTER 4 Concepts of Psychobiology 51 than experiencing each sensation individually. The thalamus is also involved in temporarily blockingminor sensations, so that an individual can concentrateon one important event when necessary. For example,an individual who is studying for an examination maybe unaware of the clock ticking in the room, or evenof another person walking into the room, because thethalamus has temporarily blocked these incomingsensations from the cortex. Hypothalamus The hypothalamus is located just below the thalamusand just above the pituitary gland and has a numberof diverse functions. 1. Regulation of the Pituitary Gland. The gland hypothalamus. The pos-terior lobe stores antidiuretic hormone (whichhelps to maintain blood pressure through regu-lation of water retention) and oxytocin (the hormone responsible for stimulation of theuterus during labor and the release of milk fromthe mammary glands). Both of these hormonesare produced in the hypothalamus. When the hypothalamus detects the body's need for thesehormones, it sends nerve impulses to the poste-rior pituitary for their release. b.The anterior lobe of the pituitary gland consists of glandular tissue that produces a number ofhormones used by the body. These hormonesare regulated by \"releasing factors\" from the hy-pothalamus. When the hormones are requiredby the body, the releasing factors stimulate therelease of the hormone from the anterior pitu-itary and the hormone in turn stimulates its target organ to carry out its specific functions. 2. Direct Neural Control over the Actions of the Autonomic Nerv ous System. The hypothalamus regulates the appropriate visceral responses dur- ing various emotional states. The actions of the autonomic nervous system are described later inthis chapter. 3. Regulation of Appetite. Appetite is regulated through response to blood nutrient levels. 4. Regulation of Temperature. The hypothalamus senses internal temperature changes in the bloodthat flows through the brain. It receives informationthrough sensory input from the skin about external temperature changes. The hypothalamus then usesthis information to promote certain types of re-sponses (e.g., sweating or shivering) that help tomaintain body temperature within the normal system.

Philadelphia, PA: Davis Company, with permission.)4092_Ch04_047-077 PM Page 5152 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing Limbic System The part of the brain known as the limbic system consists of portions of the cerebrum and the dien-cephalon. The major components include the medi-ally placed cortical and subcortical structures and thefiber tracts connecting them with one another andwith the hypothalamus. The system is composed of brain\" and is associatedwith feelings of fear and anxiety; anger, rage, and ag-gression; love, joy, and hope; and with sexuality andsocial behavior. Mesencephalon Structures of major importance in the mesencephalon,or midbrain, include nuclei and fiber tracts. The mes-encephalon extends from the pons to the hypothala-mus and is responsible for integration of variousreflexes, including visual reflexes (e.g., automaticallyturning away from a dangerous object when it comesinto view), auditory reflexes (e.g., automatically turn-ing toward a sound that is heard), and righting reflexes(e.g., automatically keeping the head upright andmaintaining balance). The mesencephalon is identi-fied in Figure 4-2. Pons The pons is a bulbous structure that lies between themidbrain and the medulla (Fig. 4-2). It is composedof large bundles of fibers and forms a major connec-tion between the cerebellum and the brainstem. Italso contains the central connections of cranialnerves V through VIII and centers for respiration andskeletal muscle tone. Medulla The medulla is the connecting structure between thespinal cord and the pons and all of the ascending anddescending fiber tracts pass through it. The vital cen-ters are contained in the medulla, and it is responsi-ble for regulation of heart rate, blood pressure, andrespiration. Also in the medulla are reflex centers forswallowing, sneezing, coughing, and vomiting. It alsocontains nuclei for cranial nerves IX through XII.The medulla, pons, and midbrain form the structureknown as the brainstem. These structures are identi-fied in Figure 4-2. Cerebellum The cerebellum is separated from the brainstem by thefourth ventricle but has connections to the brainstemthrough bundles of fiber tracts. It is situated just belowthe occipital lobes of the cerebrum (Figs. 4-1 and 4-2).The functions of the cerebellum are concerned withinvoluntary movement, such as muscular tone and coordination and the maintenance of posture andequilibrium. Nerve Tissue The tissue of the central nervous system (CNS) con-sists of nerve cells called neurons that generate andtransmit electrochemical impulses. The structure ofa neuron is composed of a cell body, an axon, anddendrites. The cell body contains the nucleus and is essential for the continued life of the neuron. Thedendrites are processes that transmit impulses toward the cell body, and the axon transmits impulses away from the cell body. The axons and dendrites are cov-ered by layers of cells called neuroglia that form a coat- ing, or \"sheath,\" of myelin. Myelin is a phospholipid that provides insulation against short-circuiting of theneurons during their electrical activity and increasesthe velocity of the impulse. The white matter of the brain and spinal cord is so called because of thewhitish appearance of the myelin sheath over theaxons and dendrites. The gray matter is composed ofcell bodies that contain no myelin. The three classes of neurons include afferent (sen- sory), efferent (motor), and interneurons. The affer- ent neurons carry impulses from receptors in the internal and external periphery to the CNS, wherethey are then interpreted into various sensations. Theefferent neurons carry impulses from the CNS to effectors in the periphery, such as muscles (that respond bycontracting) and glands (that respond by secreting).A schematic of afferent and efferent neurons is presented in Figure 4-4. Interneurons exist entirely within the CNS, and 99 percent of all nerve cells belong to this group.They may carry only sensory or motor impulses, or they may serve as integrators in the pathways between afferent and efferent neurons. They ac-count in large part for thinking, feelings, learning,language, and memory. The directional pathways ofafferent, efferent, and interneurons are presentedin Figure 4-5. Synapses Information is transmitted through the body fromone neuron to another. Some messages may beprocessed through only a few neurons, while othersmay require thousands of neuronal connections. Theneurons that transmit the impulses do not actuallytouch each other. The junction between two neuronsis called a synapse. The small space between the axon terminals of one neuron and the cell body or den-drites of another is called the synaptic cleft. Neurons conducting impulses toward the synapse are calledpresynaptic neurons and those conducting impulses away are called postsynaptic neurons.4092_Ch04_047-077 24/07/14 5:21 PM Page 52CHAPTER 4 Concepts of Psychobiology 53 A chemical, called a neurotransmitter , is stored in the axon terminals of the presynaptic neuron. An elec- trical impulse through the neuron causes the releaseof this neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. Theneurotransmitter then diffuses across the synaptic cleft and combines with receptor sites that are situated on the cell membrane of the postsynaptic neuron.The result of the combination of neurotransmitter-receptor site is the determination of whether or notanother electrical impulse is generated. If one is gen-erated, the result is called an excitatory response and the electrical impulse moves on to the next synapse, wherethe same process recurs. If another electrical impulseis not generated by the neurotransmitter-receptor sitecombination, the result is called an inhibitory response, and synaptic transmission is terminated.The cell body or dendrite of the postsynaptic neu- ron also contains a chemical inactivator that is specific to the neurotransmitter that has been released by thepresynaptic neuron. When the synaptic transmissionhas been completed, the chemical inactivator quicklyinactivates the neurotransmitter to prevent unwanted,continuous impulses, until a new impulse from thepresynaptic neuron releases more neurotransmitter.A schematic representation of a synapse is presentedin Figure 4-6. Autonomic Nervous System The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is actually con-sidered part of the peripheral nervous system.

For this reason, the ANS has been implicated in the etiology of a numberof psychophysiological disorders. The ANS has two divisions: the sympathetic and the parasympathetic. The sympathetic division is domi-nant in stressful situations and prepares the body forthe \"fight or flight\" response that was discussed inChapter 1. The neuronal cell bodies of the sympa-thetic division originate in the thoracolumbar regionof the spinal cord. Their axons extend to the chainsof sympathetic ganglia where they synapse with otherneurons that subsequently innervate the visceral effec-tors. This results in an increase in heart rate and res-pirations and a decrease in digestive secretions andperistalsis. Blood is shunted to the vital organs and toskeletal muscles to ensure adequate oxygenation. The neuronal cell bodies of the parasympathetic division originate in the brainstem and the sacral seg-ments of the spinal cord, and extend to the parasym-pathetic ganglia where the synapse takes place eithervery close to or actually in the visceral organ being innervated. In this way, a very localized response ispossible. The parasympathetic division dominateswhen an individual is in a relaxed, nonstressful con-dition. The heart and respirations are maintained at a normal rate and secretions and peristalsis in-crease for normal digestion. Elimination functionsare promoted. A schematic representation of the au-tonomic nervous system is presented in Figure 4-7. Neurotransmitters Neurotransmitters were described during the expla-nation of synaptic activity. They are being discussedseparately and in detail because of the essentialfunction they play in the role of human emotionand behavior and because they are the target formechanism of action of many of the psychotropicmedications. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that convey in- formation across synaptic clefts to neighboring targetcells. They are stored in small vesicles in the axonterminals of neurons. When the action potential, orelectrical impulse, reaches this point, the neuro-transmitters are released from the vesicles. TheyFIGURE 4-5 Directional pathways of neurons.Central Nervous SystemPeripheral body 54cross the synaptic cleft and bind with receptor sites on the cell body or dendrites of the adjacent neuronto allow the impulse to continue its course or to prevent the impulse from continuing. After the neurotransmitter has performed its function in thesynapse, it either returns to the vesicles to be storedand used again, or it is inactivated and dissolved byenzymes. The process of being stored for reuse iscalled reuptake , a function that holds significance for understanding the mechanism of action of certainpsychotropic medications. Many neurotransmitters exist in the central and peripheral nervous systems, but only a limited num-ber have implications for psychiatry. Major categoriesinclude cholinergics, monoamines, amino acids, andneuropeptides. Each of these separatelyand summarized in Table 4-2. Cholinergics Acetylcholine Acetylcholine was the first chemical to be identifiedand proven as a neurotransmitter. It is a major effec-tor chemical in the ANS, producing activity at all sympathetic and parasympathetic presynaptic nerveterminals and all parasympathetic postsynaptic nerveterminals. It is highly significant in the neurotrans-mission that occurs at the junctions of nerve and muscles. Acetylcholinesterase is the enzyme that de-stroys acetylcholine or inhibits its activity. In the the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, dense through the areaof the basal ganglia in the brain. Functions of acetylcholine are manifold and in- clude sleep, arousal, pain perception, the modulationand coordination of movement, and memory acqui-sition and retention (Gilman & Newman, 2003).Cholinergic mechanisms may have some role in cer-tain disorders of motor behavior and memory, suchas Parkinson's disease, disease, pro-duces activity at the sympathetic postsynaptic nerveterminals in the ANS resulting in the \"fight or flight\"responses in the effector organs. In the CNS, norepi-nephrine pathways returned forstorage in the vesicles of the axon terminals, it is me-tabolized and inactivated by the enzymes monoamineCHAPTER 4 Concepts of 55 Na+ Na+ Impulse transmission at a synapse. The arrow indicates the direction of electrical impulses. (From Scanlon, V.C., & Sanders, T. [2011]. Essentials of anatomy and physiology [6th ed.]. Philadelphia, PA: Davis Company, and of the reg- ulation of mood, cognition, perception, locomotion, cardiovascular functioning, and sleep and arousal(Gilman & Newman, 2003). The activity of norepi-nephrine also has been implicated in certain mooddisorders such as depression and mania, in anxietystates, and in schizophrenia (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Dopamine Dopamine pathways arise from the midbrain and hypo-thalamus and terminate in the frontal cortex, tothe spinal cord. As with norepinephrine, the inactivat-ing enzymes for dopamine are MAO and COMT. Dopamine functions include regulation of move- ments and coordination, emotions, voluntary decision-making ability, and because of its influence on thepituitary gland, it inhibits the release of prolactin(Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Increased levels ofdopamine are associated with mania (Dubovsky,Davies, & Dubovsky, 2003) and schizophrenia (Black& Andreasen, 2011).56 UNIT 4-7 The autonomic nervous system.

Serotoninthat is not returned to be stored in the axon terminalvesicles is catabolized by the enzyme MAO. Serotonin may play a role in sleep and arousal, li- bido, appetite, mood, aggression, and pain percep-tion. The serotoninergic system has been implicatedin the etiology of certain psychopathological condi-tions including anxiety states, mood disorders, andschizophrenia (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Histamine The role of histamine in mediating allergic and inflam-matory reactions has been well documented. Its rolein the CNS as a neurotransmitter has only recentlybeen confirmed, and the availability of information is limited. The highest concentrations of histamine are found within various regions of the hypothalamus.Histaminic neurons in the posterior hypothalamus are associated with (Gilman &Newman, 2003). The enzyme that catabolizes hista-mine is MAO. Although the exact processes mediatedby histamine within the central nervous system are un-certain, some data suggest that histamine may play arole in depressive illness. Amino Acids Inhibitory Amino Acids Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has a widespread distribution in the CNS,with high concentrations the hypothalamus, hip-pocampus, cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia ofthe brain, gray matter of the dorsal horn of thespinal cord, and in the retina. Most GABA is associ-ated with short inhibitory interneurons, although long-axon within the brain GABA is by the enzymeGABA GABA, pre- vent postsynaptic excitation, interrupting the progres-sion of the electrical impulse at the synaptic junction.This function is significant when slowdown of bodyactivity is advantageous. Enhancement of the GABAsystem is the mechanism of action by which the benzodiazepines produce their calming effect. Alterations in the GABA system have been impli- cated in the etiology of anxiety disorders, movementdisorders (e.g., Huntington's disease), and variousforms of epilepsy. Glycine The highest concentrations of glycine in the CNS are found in the spinal cord and brainstem. Lit- tle is known about the possible enzymatic metabolismof glycine. Glycine appears to be the neurotransmitter of re- current inhibition of motor neurons within the spinalcord, and is possibly involved in the regulation ofspinal and brainstem reflexes. It has been implicatedin the pathogenesis of certain types of spastic disor - ders and in \"glycine encephalopathy ,\" which is known to occur with toxic accumulation of the neurotrans-mitter in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (Hamosh,Scharer, & Van Hove, 2009). Excitatory and Glutamate ap- to be primary excitator y neurotransmitters in the pyramidal cells of the cortex, the cerebellum, andthe primary sensory systems. They thalamus, hypothalamus,and spinal cord. Glutamate and aspartate are inacti-vated by uptake into the tissues and through assimi-lation in various metabolic pathways. Glutamate and aspartate function in the relay of sensory information and in the regulation of variousmotor and spinal reflexes. Alteration in these systemshas been implicated in the etiology of certain neurode-generative disorders, such as Huntington's disease,temporal lobe epilepsy, and spinal cerebellar degener-ation. Recent studies have implicated increased levelsof glutamate in anxiety and depressive disorders and4092_Ch04_047-077 24/07/14 5:21 2012; Ouellet-Plamondon George, 2012). Neuropeptides Numerous neuropeptides have been identified andstudied. They are classified by the area of the body inwhich they are located or by their pharmacological orfunctional properties. Although their role as neuro-transmitters has not been clearly established, it isknown that they often coexist with the classic neuro-transmitters within a neuron; however, the functionalsignificance of this coexistence still requires furtherstudy. Hormonal neuropeptides are discussed in thesection of this chapter on neuroendocrinology. Opioid Peptides Opioid peptides, which include the endorphins andenkephalins, have been widely studied. Opioid pep-tides are found in various concentrations in the hy-pothalamus, thalamus, limbic structures, midbrain,and brainstem. Enkephalins are also the gas-trointestinal (GI) tract. Opioid peptides are thoughtto have a role in pain modulation, with their naturalmorphine-like properties. They are released in re-sponse to painful stimuli, and may be responsible for producing the analgesic effect following acupunc-ture. Opioid peptides alter the release of dopamineand affect the spontaneous activity of the dopaminer-gic neurons. These findings may have some implica-tion for opioid peptide-dopamine interaction in theetiology of schizophrenia. Substance P Substance P was the first neuropeptide to be discov-ered. It is present in high concentrations in the hypo-thalamus, limbic structures, midbrain, and brainstem,and is also found in the thalamus, basal ganglia, andspinal cord. Substance P has been found to be highlyconcentrated in sensory fibers, and for this reason is thought to play a role in sensory transmission, and particularly in the regulation of pain. SubstanceP abnormalities have been associated with Hunting-ton's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and mood disorders(Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Somatostatin Somatostatin (also called growth hormone-inhibitinghormone) is found in the cerebral cortex, hippocam-pus, thalamus, basal ganglia, brainstem, and spinalcord, on the CNS. In its func-tion as a neurotransmitter, somatostatin exerts bothstimulatory and inhibitory effects. Depending on thepart of the brain being affected, it has been shown tostimulate dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, andacetylcholine, and inhibit a neuromodulator forserotonin in the hypothalamus, thereby regulating itsrelease (i.e., determining whether it is stimulated orinhibited). It is possible that somatostatin may servethis function for other neurotransmitters as well.High concentrations of somatostatin have been re-ported in brain specimens of clients with Hunting-ton's disease, and low concentrations in those withAlzheimer's disease. CHAPTER 4 Concepts of Psychobiology 59 Neuroendocrinology Human endocrine functioning has a strong founda-tion in the CNS, under the direction of the hypothal-amus, which has direct control over the pituitarygland. The pituitary gland has two major lobes\u2014theanterior the ) and (also called the neurohypophysis). The pituitary gland is only about the size of a pea, but despite its size and because of the powerful control it exerts over endocrine functioning in humans, it is sometimes called the \"master gland.\" (Figure 4-8shows the hormones of the pituitary gland and theirtarget organs.) Many of the hormones subject to hy-pothalamus-pituitary regulation may have implica-tions for behavioral functioning. Discussion of thesehormones is summarized in 4-3. Pituitary Gland The Posterior oxytocin. andstored in the posterior pituitary. Their release neural impulses from the hypothalamus(Fig. 4-9). Antidiuretic Hormone The main function of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)is to conserve body water and maintain normal bloodpressure. The release of ADH is stimulated by pain,emotional stress, dehydration, increased plasma con-centration, and decreases in blood volume. An alter-ation in the secretion of this hormone may be a factorin the polydipsia observed in about 10 to 15 percentof hospitalized psychiatric patients. Other factors cor-related with this behavior include adverse effects ofCORE CONCEPT Neuroendocrinology Study of the interaction between the nervous system and the endocrine system, and the effects of various hormoneson cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functioning. 4092_Ch04_047-077 24/07/14 5:21 PM Page 5960 UNIT 2 Foundations Nursing Hypothalamus and their target organs.

ADH also may play a role in learn-ing and memory, in alteration of the pain response,and in the modification of sleep patterns. Oxytocin Oxytocin stimulates contraction of the uterus at theend of pregnancy and stimulates release of milk fromthe mammary glands (Scanlon & Sanders, 2011). It isalso released in response to stress and during sexualarousal. Its role in behavioral functioning is unclear,although it is possible that oxytocin may act in certainsituations to stimulate the release of adrenocorti-cotropic hormone (ACTH), thereby playing a keyrole in the overall hormonal response to stress. The Anterior Pituitary (Adenohypophysis) The hypothalamus produces releasing hormones that pass through capillaries and veins of the hypophysealportal system to capillaries in the anterior pituitary,where they stimulate secretion of specialized hor-mones. This pathway is presented in Figure 4-9. Thehormones of the anterior pituitary gland regulatemultiple growth hor-mone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, ACTH, prolactin,gonadotropin-stimulating hormone, and melanocyte-stimulating hormone. Most of these hormones areregulated by a negative feedback mechanism . Once the hormone has exerted its effects, the information is\"fed back\" to the anterior pituitary, which inhibits therelease, and ultimately decreases the effects, of thestimulating hormones. Growth Hormone The release of growth hormone (GH), also called somatotropin, is stimulated by growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) from the hypothalamus.Its release is inhibited by growth hormone-inhibitinghormone (GHIH), or somatostatin, also from the hy-pothalamus. It is responsible for growth in children,4092_Ch04_047-077 24/07/14 5:21 PM Page 61as well as continued protein synthesis throughout life. During periods of fasting, it stimulates the release offat from the adipose tissue to be used for increasedenergy. The release of GHIH is stimulated in responseto periods of hyperglycemia. GHRH is stimulated inresponse to hypoglycemia and to stressful situations.During prolonged stress, GH has a direct effect onprotein, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, result-ing in increased serum glucose and free fatty acids to be used for increased energy. There has been some indication of a possible correlation between abnormal secretion of growth hormone and anorexianervosa. Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone Thyrotropin-releasing hormone from TSH to secretetriiodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T4). Thyroid hormones are integral to the metabolism of food andthe regulation of temperature. A correlation between thyroid dysfunction and al- tered behavioral functioning has been studied. Earlyreports in the medical literature associated hyperthy-roidism with irritability, insomnia, anxiety, restless-ness, weight loss, and emotional liability, and in someinstances with progressing to delirium or psychosis.Symptoms of fatigue, decreased libido, memory im-pairment, depression, suicidal ideations havebeen associated with chronic hypothyroidism. Studieshave correlated various forms of thyroid dysfunctionwith mood disorders, anxiety, eating disorders, schiz-ophrenia, and neurocognitive disorder. Adrenocorticotropic Hormone Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) role of cortisol in humanbehaviors is not well understood, although it seemsto be secreted under stressful situations. Disorders ofthe adrenal result in hyposecretion or hy-persecretion of cortisol. Addison's disease is the result of hyposecretion of the hormones of the adrenal cortex. Behavioral symp-toms of hyposecretion include mood changes with ap-athy, social withdrawal, impaired sleep, decreasedconcentration, and fatigue. Hypersecretion of cortisolresults in Cushing's disease and is associated with be-haviors that include depression, mania, psychosis, andsuicidal ideation. Cognitive impairments also havebeen commonly observed. prolactin-inhibitinghormone (PIH) from the hypothalamus. Prolactinstimulates milk production by the mammary glandsin the presence of high levels of estrogen and prog-esterone during pregnancy. Behavioral symptoms as-sociated with hypersecretion of prolactin include62 UNIT 2 pituitary stores hormones produced in the hypothalamus. (B)Releasing hormones of the hypothalamus circulate directly to the anterior pituitary and influence its secretions. Notice the tw o networks of cap- illaries. (From Scanlon, V.C., & Sanders, T. [2011]. anatomy and physiology [6th ed.]. and increased irritability. Gonadotropic Hormones The gonadotropic hormones are so called becausethey produce an effect on the gonads\u2014the ovariesand the gonadotropins include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) luteinizing hormone(LH), and their release from the anterior pituitary is stimulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) from the hypothalamus. In women, FSH ini-tiates maturation of ovarian follicles into ova andstimulates their secretion of estrogen. LH is respon-sible for ovulation and the the corpus luteum. In men, by the interstitial cells of the testes(Scanlon & Sanders, 2011). The gonadotropins areregulated by a negative feedback of gonadal hor-mones at the hypothalamic or pituitary level. Limited evidence exists to correlate gonadotropins to behavioral functioning, although some observa-tions have been made to warrant hypothetical consid-eration. Studies have indicated decreased levels oftestosterone, LH, and FSH in depressed men. In-creased sexual behavior and aggressiveness have beenlinked to elevated testosterone levels in both men andwomen. Decreased plasma levels of LH and FSH com-monly occur in patients with anorexia nervosa. Sup-plemental estrogen therapy has resulted in improvedmentation and mood in some depressed women. Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) from the hy-pothalamus secretemelatonin. The release of melatonin appears to de-pend on the onset of darkness and is suppressed bylight. Studies of this hormone have indicated that environmental light can affect neuronal activity andinfluence circadian rhythms . Correlation between ab- normal secretion of melatonin and symptoms of depression has led to the implication of melatonin inthe etiology of seasonal affective disorder (SAD), inwhich individuals become depressed only during thefall and winter months when the amount of daylightdecreases. Circadian Rhythms Human biological rhythms are largely determined bygenetic coding, with input from the external environ-ment influencing the cyclic effects. Circadian rhythms in humans follow a near-24-hour cycle and may influ-ence a variety of regulatory functions, including thesleep-wakefulness cycle, body temperature regulation,patterns of activity such as eating and drinking, andhormone secretion. The 24-hour rhythms in humansare affected to a large degree by the cycles of lightnessand darkness. This occurs because of a \"pacemaker\"in the brain that sends messages to other systems inthe body and maintains the 24-hour rhythm. This endogenous pacemaker appears to be the suprachi-asmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. These nuclei re-ceive projections of light through the retina, and inturn stimulate electrical impulses to various other sys-tems in the body, mediating the release of neurotrans-mitters or hormones that regulate bodily functioning. Most of the biological rhythms of the body operate over a period of about 24 hours, but cycles of longerlengths have been studied. For example, women ofmenstruating age show monthly cycles of proges-terone levels in the saliva, of skin temperature overthe breasts, and of prolactin levels in the plasma ofthe blood (Hughes, 1989). Some rhythms may even last as long as a year. These circannual rhythms are particularly relevant to certainmedications, such as cyclosporine, that appears to bemore effective at some times than others during theperiod of about a year (Hughes, 1989). One clinicalstudy showed that administration of chemotherapyduring the appropriate circadian phase can signifi-cantly increase the efficacy and decrease the toxic effects of certain cytotoxic agents (Lis et al., 2003). The Role of Circadian Rhythms in Psychopathology Circadian rhythms may play a role in psychopathol-ogy. Because many hormones have been implicatedin behavioral functioning, it is reasonable to believethat peak secretion times could be influential in pre-dicting certain behaviors. The association of depres-sion with increased secretion of melatonin duringdarkness hours has already been discussed. Externalmanipulation of the light-dark cycle and removal ofexternal time cues often have beneficial effects onmood disorders. Symptoms that occur in the premenstrual cycle have also been linked to disruptions in biologicalrhythms. A number of the symptoms associated withpremenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) strongly re-semble those attributed to depression, and hormonalchanges have been implicated in the etiology. Someof these changes include progesterone-estrogen im-balance, increase in prolactin and mineralocorticoids,high level of prostaglandins, decrease in endogenousopiates, changes metabolism of biogenic amines(serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, a oline), and variations in secretion of glucocorticoids or melatonin. Sleep disturbances are common in both depres- sion and PMDD. Because the sleep-wakefulness cycleis probably the most fundamental of biologicalrhythms, it will be discussed in greater detail. A CHAPTER 4 Concepts of Psychobiology 634092_Ch04_047-077 24/07/14 5:21 PM Page 63representation of bodily functions affected by 24-hour biological rhythms is presented in Figure 4-10. Sleep The sleep-wakefulness cycle is genetically determinedrather than learned and is established some time after birth. Even when environmental cues such as theability to detect light and darkness are removed, thehuman sleep-wakefulness cycle generally developsabout a 25-hour periodicity, which is close to the 24-hour normal circadian rhythm. Sleep can be measured by the types of brain waves that occur during various stages of sleep activity.Dreaming episodes are characterized by rapid eyemovement and are called REM sleep. The sleep-wakefulness cycle is represented by six distinct stages. 1. Stage 0: Alpha Rhythm. This stage of the sleep- wakefulness cycle is characterized by a relaxed,64 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing (Clock Hours) ------------------------0800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 2200 2400 0200 0400 0600 (Darkness) Body temperature Pulse rate Blood pressure 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28/unif074/unif074 /unif073/unif073 * /unif074 indicates low point and /unif073 indicates peak time of these biological factors within a 24-hour circadian rhythm.** The female hormones are presented on a monthly rhythm because of their influence on the reproductive cycle.

Beta brain wave r hythm has a fre- quency of 18 to 25 cycles per second. 3. Stage 2: Theta Rhythm. This stage characterizes the manner in which about half of sleep time isspent. Eye movement and muscular activity areminimal. Theta brain wave rhythm has a frequency of 4 to 7 cycles per second. 4 . Stage 3: Delta Rhythm. This is a period of deep and restful sleep. Muscles are relaxed, heart rateand blood pressure fall, and breathing slows. Noeye movement occurs. Delta brain wave rhythm has a frequency of 1.5 to 3 cycles per second. 5. Stage 4: Delta Rhythm. This is the stage of deepest sleep. Individuals who suffer from insomnia orother sleep disorders often do not experience thisstage of sleep. Eye movement and muscular activityare minimal. Delta waves predominate. 6. REM Sleep: Beta Rhythm. The dream cycle occurs during REM sleep. Eyes dart about beneath closedeyelids, moving more rapidly than when awake.The brain wave pattern is similar to that of stage 1 sleep. Heart and respiration rates increase andblood pressure may increase or decrease. Musclesare hypotonic during REM sleep. Stages 2 through REM repeat themselves through- out the cycle of sleep. One is more likely to experi-ence longer periods of stages 3 and 4 sleep early inthe cycle and longer periods of REM sleep later in thesleep cycle. Most people experience REM sleep aboutfour to five times during the night. The amount ofREM sleep and deep sleep decreases with age, whilethe time spent in drowsy wakefulness and dozing increases. Neurochemical Influences A number of neurochemicals have been shown to in-fluence the sleep-wakefulness cycle. Several studieshave revealed information about the sleep-inducingcharacteristics of serotonin. L-tryptophan, the amino acid precursor to serotonin, has been used for manyyears as an effective sedative-hypnotic to induce sleepin individuals with sleep-onset disorder. Serotoninand norepinephrine both appear to be most activeduring non-REM sleep, whereas the neurotransmitteracetylcholine is activated during REM sleep (Skudaev,2010). The exact role of GABA in sleep facilitation is unclear, although the sedative effects of drugs that enhance GABA transmission, such as the benzo-diazepines, suggest that this neurotransmitter playsan important role in regulation of sleep and arousal.Some studies have suggested that acetylcholine in-duces and prolongs REM sleep, whereas histamine appears to have an inhibitory effect. Neuroendocrinemechanisms seem to be more closely tied to circadianrhythms than to the sleep-wakefulness cycle. One exception is growth hormone secretion, which ex-hibits increases during the early sleep period and may be associated with slow-wave sleep (Van Cauteret al., 1992). CHAPTER 4 Concepts of Psychobiology 65 Genetics Human behavioral genetics seeks to understand boththe genetic and environmental contributions to indi-vidual variations in human behavior (McInerney,2008). This type of study is complicated by the fact thatbehaviors, like all complex traits, involve multiple genes. The term genotype refers to the total set of genes present in an individual at the time of conception, andcoded in the DNA. The physical manifestations of a par-ticular genotype are designated by characteristics thatspecify a specific phenotype. Examples of phenotypesinclude eye color, height, blood type, language, hairtype, and method of communication. As evident by theexamples presented, phenotypes are not onlygenetic, but may also be acquired (i.e., influenced by the envi-ronment) or a combination of both. It is likely thatmany psychiatric disorders are the result of a combina-tion of genetics and environmental influences. Investigators who study the etiological implications for psychiatric illness may explore several risk factors.Studies to determine if an illness is familial compare the percentages of family members with the illness tothose in the general population or within a controlgroup of unrelated individuals. These studies estimatethe prevalence of psychopathology among relatives,and make predictions about the predisposition to anillness based on familial risk factors. Schizophrenia,bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, anorexianervosa, panic disorder, somatic symptom disorder,antisocial personality disorder, and alcoholism are examples of psychiatric illness in which familial ten-dencies have been indicated. Studies that are purely genetic in nature search for a specific gene that is responsible for an individualhaving a particular illness. A number of disordersexist in which the mutation of a specific gene orCORE CONCEPT Genetics Study of the biological transmission of certain character- istics (physical and/or behavioral) from parent to offspring. 4092_Ch04_047-077 24/07/14 5:21 PM Page 65change in the number or structure of a chromosome has been associated with the etiology. Examples in-clude and Downsyndrome. The search for genetic links to certain psychiatric disorders continues. Risk factors for early-onsetAlzheimer's disease have been linked to mutations onchromosomes 21, 14, and 1 (National Institute onAging, 2012). Other studies have linked a gene in theregion of chromosome 19 that produces apolipopro-tein E (ApoE) with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Additional research is required before definitive con-firmation can be made. In addition to familial and purely genetic investi- gations, other types of studies have been conductedto estimate the existence and degree of genetic and environmental contributions to the etiology ofcertain psychiatric disorders. Twin studies and adop-tion studies have been successfully employed for thispurpose. Twin studies examine the frequency of a disorder in monozygotic (genetically identical) and dizygotic(fraternal; not genetically identical) twins. Twins are called concordant when both members suffer from the same disorder in question. Concordancein monozygotic twins is considered stronger evi-dence of genetic involvement than it is in dizygotictwins. Disorders in which twin studies have sug-gested a possible genetic link include alcoholism,schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolardisorder, anorexia nervosa, panic disorder, and ob-sessive-compulsive disorder (Baker, 2004; Gill, 2004;O'Donovan, 2012). Adoption studies allow comparisons to be made of the influences of genetics versus environment on thedevelopment of a psychiatric disorder. Knowles(2003) describes the following four types of adoptionstudies that have been conducted: 1. The study of adopted children whose biologicalparent(s) had a psychiatric disorder but whoseadoptive parent(s) did not. 2. The study of adopted children whose adoptive par-ent(s) had a psychiatric disorder but whose biolog-ical parent(s) did not. 3. The study of adoptive and biological relatives of adopted children who developed a psychiatricdisorder. 4. The study of monozygotic twins reared apart bydifferent adoptive parents. Disorders in which adoption studies have sug- gested a possible genetic link include alcoholism,schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and antisocialpersonality disorder (Knowles, 2003). A summary of various psychiatric disorders and the possible biological influences discussed in thischapter is presented in Table 4-4.

Continued4092_Ch04_047-077 24/07/14 5:21 PM Page 67Psychoimmunology Normal Immune Response Cells responsible for nonspecific immune reactions in- clude neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. They work to destroy the invasive organism and initi-ate and facilitate damaged tissue. If these cells are noteffective in accomplishing a satisfactory healing re-sponse, specific immune mechanisms take over. Specific immune mechanisms are divided into two major types: the cellular response and the humoralresponse. The controlling elements of the cellular re-sponse are the T lymphocytes (T cells); those of thehumoral response are called B lymphocytes (B cells).When the body is invaded by a specific antigen, the T cells, and particularly the CD4 T lymphocytes (alsocalled helper T cells), become sensitized to and specific for the foreign antigen. These antigen-specific CD4T cells divide many times, producing antigen-specificCD4 T cells with other functions. One of these, thekiller T cell, destroys viruses that reproduce insideother cells by puncturing the cell membrane of thehost cell and allowing the contents of the cell, includ-ing viruses, to spill out into the bloodstream, wherethey can be engulfed by macrophages. Another cellproduced through division of the CD4 T cells is thesuppressor T cell, which serves to stop the immune re-sponse once the foreign antigen has been destroyed(Scanlon & Sanders, 2011). The humoral response is activated when antigen- specific CD4 T cells communicate with the B cells in the spleen and lymph nodes. The B cells in turnproduce the antibodies specific to the foreign anti-gen. Antibodies attach themselves to foreign antigensso that they are unable to invade body cells. These invader cells are then destroyed without being able to multiply. Implications of the Immune System in Psychiatric Illness In studies of the biological response to stress, it has been hypothesized that individuals become more susceptible to physical illness following exposure to a stressful stimulus or life event (see Chapter 1). This response is thought to be due to the effect of increased glucocorticoid release from the adrenalcortex following stimulation from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during stressful situations. Theresult is a suppression in lymphocyte proliferationand function. Studies have shown that nerve endings exist in tis- sues of the immune system. The CNS has connectionsin both bone marrow and the thymus, where immune68 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing TABLE 4-5 Diagnostic Procedures Used to Detect Altered Brain Functioning\u2014cont'd EXAM TECHNIQUE USED PURPOSE OF THE EXAM AND POSSIBLE FINDINGS Magnetic resonance imaging (MR I) Positron emission tomography (PET) Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)Within a strong magnetic field, the nu- clei of hydrogen atoms absorb andreemit electromagnetic energy thatis computerized and transformedinto image information.

Growth hormone, which may be released in re- sponse to certain stressors, may enhance immunefunctioning, whereas testosterone is thought to in-hibit immune functioning. Increased production ofepinephrine and norepinephrine occurs in responseto stress, and may decrease immunity. Serotonin hasdemonstrated both enhancing and inhibitory effectson immunity (Irwin, 2000). Studies have correlated a decrease in lymphocyte functioning with periods of grief, bereavement, anddepression, associating the degree of altered immu-nity with severity of the depression. A number of research studies have been conducted attemptingto correlate the onset of schizophrenia to abnormal-ities of the immune system. These studies have considered autoimmune responses, viral infections,and immunogenetics (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). The role of these factors in the onset and course of schizophrenia remains unclear. Immunologicalabnormalities have also been investigated in a number of other psychiatric illnesses, including al-coholism, autism spectrum disorder, and neurocog-nitive disorder. Evidence exists to support a correlation between psychosocial stress and the onset of illness. Researchis still required to determine the specific processesinvolved in stress-induced modulation of the im-mune system. Psychopharmacology The middle of the 20th century identifies a pivotal pe-riod in the treatment of individuals with mental ill-ness. It was during this time that the phenothiazineclass of antipsychotics was introduced into the UnitedStates. Before that time they had been used in Franceas preoperative medications. As Dr. Henri Laborit ofthe Hospital Boucicaut in Paris stated, It was our aim to decrease the anxiety of the patients to prepare them in advance for their postoperativerecovery. With these new drugs, the phenothiazines,we were seeing a profound psychic and physical re-laxation . . . a real indifference to the environmentand to the upcoming operation. It seemed to methese drugs must have an application in psychiatry.(Sage, 1984) Indeed they have had a significant application in psychiatry. Not only have they helped many individu- als to function effectively, but they have also provided researchers and clinicians with information to studythe origins and etiologies of mental illness. Knowl-edge gained from learning how these drugs work has promoted advancement in understanding howbehavioral disorders develop. Dr. Arnold Scheibel, di-rector of the UCLA Brain Research Institute, stated, [When these drugs came out] there was a sense of disbelief that we could actually do something substan-tive for the patients . . . see them for the first time assick individuals and not as something bizarre that wecould literally not talk to. (Sage, 1984)CHAPTER 4 Concepts of Psychobiology 69 Historical Perspectives Historically, reaction to and treatment of individuals with mental illness ranged from benign involvementto interventions some would consider inhumane. In-dividuals with mental illness were feared because ofcommon beliefs associating them with demons or thesupernatural. They were looked upon as loathsomeand often were mistreated. Beginning in the late 18th century, a type of \"moral reform\" in the treatment of persons with mental ill-ness began to occur. Community and state hospitalsconcerned with the needs of persons with mental ill-ness were established. Considered a breakthrough inthe humanization of care, these institutions, howeverwell intentioned, fostered the concept of custodialcare. Clients were ensured the provision of food andshelter but received little or no hope of change forthe future. As they became increasingly dependenton the institution to fill their needs, the likelihood oftheir return to the family or community diminished. The early part of the 20th century saw the advent of the somatic therapies in psychiatry. Individuals withmental illness were treated with insulin shock therapy,wet sheet packs, ice baths, electroconvulsive therapy,and psychosurgery. Before 1950, sedatives and am-phetamines were the only significant psychotropicmedications available. Even these had limited use be-cause of their toxicity and addicting effects. Since the1950s, the development of psychopharmacology hasexpanded to include widespread use of antipsychotic,antidepressant, and antianxiety medications. Researchinto how these drugs work has provided an under-standing of the etiology of many psychiatric disorders. Psychotropic medications are not intended to \"cure\" the mental illness. Most mental health practi-tioners who prescribe these medications for theirclients use them as an adjunct to individual or grouppsychotherapy. Although their contribution to psychi-atric care cannot be minimized, it must be empha-sized that psychotropic medications relieve physicalCORE CONCEPT Psychotropic Medication Medication that affects psychic function, behavior, or experience. 4092_Ch04_047-077 24/07/14 5:21 PM Page 6970 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing treatment centers, home health care, and other settings, the nurse is the key health-care profes-sional in direct contact with the individual receivingthe chemotherapy. Medication administration is followed by a careful evaluation, including contin-uous monitoring for side effects and adverse reac-tions. The nurse also evaluates the therapeuticeffectiveness of the medication. It is essential for the nurse to have a thorough knowledge of psy-chotropic medications to be able to anticipate po-tential problems and outcomes associated with theiradministration. Client Education The information associated with psychotropic med-ications is copious and complex. An important roleof the nurse is to translate that complex informa-tion into terms that can be easily understood by theclient. Clients must understand why the medicationhas been prescribed, when it should be taken, andwhat they may expect in terms of side effects andpossible adverse reactions. They must know whomto contact when they have a question and when it is important to report to their physician. Medica-tion education encourages client cooperation andand behavioral symptoms. They do not resolve emo-tional problems. Role of the Nurse Ethical and Legal Implications Nurses must understand the ethical and legal impli-cations associated with the administration of psy-chotropic medications. Laws differ from state to state,but most adhere to the client's right to refuse treat-ment. Exceptions exist in emergency situations whenit has been determined that clients are likely to harmthemselves or others. Assessment A thorough baseline assessment must be conductedbefore a client is placed on a regimen of psychophar-macological therapy. A history and physical examina-tion (see Chapter 9), an ethnocultural assessment(see Chapter 6), and a comprehensive medication as-sessment (see Box 4-1) are all essential componentsof this database.

How Do Psychotropics Work? Most of the medications have their effects at theneuronal synapse, producing changes in neuro-transmitter release and the receptors to which theybind (see Figure 4-11). Researchers hypothesizethat most antidepressants work the re-uptake of neurotransmitters, serotoninand norepinephrine. Reuptake is the process neu- rotransmitter inactivation which the neurotrans-mitter is reabsorbed into the presynaptic neuronfrom which it had been released. Blocking the reuptake process allows more of the neurotransmit-ter to be available for neuronal transmission. Thismechanism of action may also result in undesirableside effects (see Table 4-6). Some antidepressantsalso block receptor sites that are unrelated to their mechanisms of action. These include alpha-adrenergic, histaminergic, and muscarinic cholin-ergic receptors. Blocking these receptors is alsoassociated with the development of certain side effects.Antipsychotic medications block dopamine recep- tors, and some affect histamin-ergic, and release. Although each psychotropic medication affects neu- rotransmission, the specific drugs within each classhave varying neuronal effects. Their exact mechanismsof action are unknown. Many of the neuronal effectsoccur acutely; however, the therapeutic effects maytake weeks for some medications such as antidepres-sants and antipsychotics. Acute alterations in neuronalfunction do not fully explain how these medicationswork. Long-term neuropharmacological reactions toincreased norepinephrine and serotonin levels relatemore to their mechanisms of action. Recent researchsuggests that the therapeutic effects are related to thenervous system's adaptation to increased levels of neu-rotransmitters. These adaptive changes result from ahomeostatic mechanism, much like a thermostat, thatregulates the cell and maintains equilibrium.4092_Ch04_047-077 24/07/14 5:21 PM Page 7172 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing FIGURE 4-11 Area of synaptic transmission that is altered by drugs. The transmission of electrical impulses from the axon terminal of one neuron to the dendrite of another is achieved by the cont rolled release of neurotransmitters others. Prior to its release, the neurotransmitter is concentra ted into specialized synaptic vesicles. Once fired, the neurotransmitter is released into the synaptic cleft where it encounters re ceptors on the postsynaptic membrane. Each neurotransmitter has receptors specific to it alone. Some neurotransmitters are considered to be excitatory, whereas others are inhibitory, a feature that determines whether another action potential will occur. In the synaptic cleft,the neurotransmitter rapidly diffuses, is catabolized by enzymatic action, or is taken up by the neurotransmitter transporters and returned to vesicles inside the axon terminal to await another action potential. Psychotropic medications exert their effects in various ways in this area of synaptic transmission. Reuptake inhibitors block r eup- take of the neurotransmitters by the transporter proteins, thus resulting in elevated levels of extracellular neurotransmitter. Drugs thatinhibit catabolic enzymes promote excess buildup of the neurotransmitter at the synaptic site. Some drugs cause receptor blockade, thereby resulting in a reduction in transmission and decreased neurotransmitter activity. T hese drugs are called antagonists. Drugs that increase neurotransmitter activity by direct stimulation of the specific receptors are called agonists.

Psychiatric nurses mustintegrate knowledge of the biological sciences intotheir practices if they are to ensure safe and effectivecare to people with mental illness. In the SurgeonGeneral's Report on Mental Health (U.S. Departmentof Health and Human Services, 1999), Dr. DavidSatcher wrote: The mental health field is far from a complete under- standing of the biological, psychological, and socio-cultural bases of development, but development4092_Ch04_047-077 24/07/14 5:21 PM Page 73clearly involves interplay among these influences. Understanding the process of development requiresknowledge, ranging from the most fundamentallevel\u2014that of gene expression and interactions between molecules and cells\u2014all the way up to the highest levels of cognition, memory, emotion,and language. The challenge requires integration of concepts from many different disciplines. A fullerunderstanding of development is not only importantin its own right, but it is expected to pave the way for our ultimate understanding of mental health and mental illness and how different factors shapetheir expression at different stages of the life span.(pp. 61-62) To ensure a smooth transition from a psychosocial focus to one of biopsychosocial emphasis, nurses must have a clear understanding of the following: Neuroanatomy and neurophysiology: the structure and functioning of the various parts of the brainand their correlation to human behavior and psychopathology. Neuronal processes : the various functions of the nerve cells, including the role of neurotransmit-ters, receptors, synaptic activity, and informationalpathways. Neuroendocrinology : the interaction of the en- docrine and nervous systems, and the role that theendocrine glands and their respective hormonesplay in behavioral functioning. Circadian rhythms: the regulation of biochemicalfunctioning over periods of rhythmic cycles and itsinfluence in predicting certain behaviors. Genetic influences : the hereditary factors that predis- pose individuals to certain psychiatric disorders. Psychoimmunology : the influence of stress on the immune system and its role in the susceptibility toillness. Psychopharmacology: the increasing use of psy-chotropic drugs in the treatment of mental illness,demanding greater knowledge of psychopharma-cological principles and nursing interventions nec-essary for safe and effective management. Diagnostic technology : the importance of keeping informed about the latest in technological proce-dures for diagnosing alterations in brain structureand function. Why are these concepts important to the practice of psychiatric/mental health nursing? The interrela-tionship between psychosocial adaptation and physi-cal functioning has been established. Integratingbiological and behavioral concepts into psychiatricnursing practice is essential for nurses to meet thecomplex needs of clients with mental illness. Psy-chobiological perspectives must be incorporated intonursing practice, education, and research to attainthe evidence-based outcomes necessary for the deliv-ery of competent care. Summary and Key Points It is important for nurses to understand the inter-action between biological and behavioral factors in the development and management of mental illness. Psychobiology is the study of the biological foun-dations of cognitive, emotional, and behavioralprocesses. The limbic system has been called \"the emotionalbrain.\" It is associated with feelings of fear and anx-iety; anger, rage, and aggression; love, joy, andhope; and with sexuality and social behavior. The three classes of neurons include afferent(sensory), efferent (motor), and interneurons.The junction between two neurons is called asynapse. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that convey in-formation across synaptic clefts neighboringtarget cells. Many neurotransmitters have impli-cations in the etiology of emotional disorders and in the pharmacological treatment of thosedisorders. Major categories of neurotransmitters includecholinergics, monoamines, amino acids, and neuropeptides. The endocrine system plays an important role inhuman behavior through the hypothalamic-pituitaryaxis. Hormones and their circadian rhythm of regula-tion significantly influence a number of physiolog-ical and psychological life cycle phenomena, suchas moods, sleep and arousal, stress response, ap-petite, libido, and fertility. Research continues to validate the role of geneticsin psychiatric illness. Familial, twin, and adoption studies suggest that ge-netics may be implicated in the etiology of schizo-phrenia, bipolar disorder, depressive disorder,panic disorder, anorexia nervosa, alcoholism, andobsessive-compulsive disorder. Psychoimmunology examines the impact of psy-chological factors on the immune system. Evidence exists to support a link between psychoso-cial stressors and suppression of the immune response. Technologies such as magnetic resonance im-agery (MRI), co mputed tomographic (CT) scan, positron and elec-troencephalography are used as diagnostictools for detecting alterations in psychobiologicalfunctioning.74 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing4092_Ch04_047-077 24/07/14 5:21 PM Page 74Psychotropic medications have given many individ- uals a chance to function effectively. Nurses must understand the ethical and legal im-plications associated with the administration of psychotropic medications, and knowledge of thephysiological mechanisms by which psychotropicmedications exert their effects.Integrating knowledge of the expanding biologicalfocus into psychiatric nursing is essential if nursesare to meet the changing needs of today's psychi-atric clients.CHAPTER 4 Concepts of Psychobiology 75 Additional info available at www.davisplus.com Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions: 1.

Complex situations frequentlyarise in caring for individuals with mental illness,and nurses are held to the highest level of legal andethical accountability in their professional practice.This chapter presents basic ethical and legal con-cepts and their relationship to psychiatric/mentalhealth nursing. A discussion of ethical theory is pre-sented as a foundation upon which ethical decisionsmay be made. The American Nurses' Association(ANA) (2001) has established a code of ethics fornurses to use as a framework within which to makeethical choices and decisions (Box 5-1). Because legislation determines what is right orgood within a society, legal issues pertaining to psychiatric/mental health nursing are also dis-cussed in this chapter. Definitions are presented,along with rights of psychiatric clients of whichnurses must be aware. Nursing competency andclient care accountability are compromised whenthe nurse has inadequate knowledge about the lawsthat regulate the practice of nursing. Knowledge of the legal and ethical concepts pre- sented in this chapter will enhance the quality of carethe nurse provides in his or her psychiatric/mentalhealth nursing practice and will also protect the nursewithin the parameters of legal accountability. Indeed,the very right to practice nursing carries with it theresponsibility to maintain a specific level of compe-tency and to practice in accordance with certain ethical and legal standards of care. BOX 5-1 American Nurses' Association Code of Ethics for Nurses 1. The nurse, in all professional relationships, practices with compassion and respect for the inherent dignity, worth and uniqueness of every individual, unrestricted by con-sideration of social or economic status, personal attributes,or the nature of health problems. 2. The nurse's primary commitment is to the patient whether an individual, family, group or community. 3. The nurse promotes, advocates for and strives to protect the health, safety, and rights of the patient. 4. The nurse is responsible and accountable for individual nursing practice and determines the appropriate delega-tion of tasks consistent with the nurse's obligation to provide optimum patient care. 5. The nurse owes the same duties to self as to others, in- cluding the responsibility to preserve integrity and safety,to maintain competence, and to continue personal andprofessional growth.6. The nurse participates in establishing, maintaining, and improving healthcare environments and conditions of em-ployment conducive to the provision of quality healthcareand consistent with the values of the profession throughindividual and collective action. 7. The nurse participates in the advancement of the profes- sion through contributions to practice, education, admin-istration, and knowledge development. 8. The nurse collaborates with other health professionals and the public in promoting community, national, and interna-tional efforts to meet health needs. 9. The profession of nursing, as represented by associations and their members, is responsible for articulating nursingvalues, for maintaining the integrity of the profession andits practice, and for shaping social policy. \u00a9 2001 Code of Ethics for Nurses with Interpretive Statements. By American Nurses Association. Reprinted with permission. All Rights Reserred.CORE CONCEPTS Ethics is a branch of philosophy that deals with system- atic approaches to distinguishing right from wrong be-havior (Butts & Rich, 2008). Bioethics is the term applied to these principles when they refer to concepts withinthe scope of medicine, nursing, and allied health. Moral behavior is defined as conduct that results from serious critical thinking about how individualsought to treat others. Moral behavior reflects the waya person interprets basic respect for other persons,such as the respect for autonomy, freedom, justice,honesty, and confidentiality. Values are personal beliefs about what is important and desirable (Butts & Rich, 2008). Values clarification is a process of self-exploration through which individu-als identify and rank their own personal values. Thisprocess increases awareness about why individuals be-have in certain ways. Values clarification is important innursing to increase understanding about why certainchoices and decisions are made over others and howvalues affect nursing outcomes. A right is defined as \"a valid, legally recognized claim or entitlement, encompassing both freedom from govern-ment interference or discriminatory treatment and an en-titlement to a benefit or service\" (Levy and Rubenstein,1996). A right is absolute when there is no restriction whatsoever on the individual's entitlement. A legal right is one on which the society has agreed and formalized intolaw. Both the National League for Nursing (NLN) and theAmerican Hospital Association (AHA) have establishedguidelines of patients' rights. Although these are not con-sidered legal documents, nurses and hospitals are con-sidered responsible for upholding these rights of patients. 4092_Ch05_078-094 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 79Ethical Considerations Theoretical Perspectives An ethical theory is a moral principle or a set of moral principles that can be used in assessing what is morally right or morally wrong (Ellis & Hartley,2012). These principles provide guidelines for ethicaldecision making. Utilitarianism The basis of utilitarianism is \"the greatest-happiness principle.\" This principle holds that actions are rightto the degree that they tend to promote happinessand wrong as they tend to produce the reverse ofhappiness. Thus, the good is happiness and the rightis that which promotes the good. Conversely, thewrongness of an action is determined by its tendencyto bring about unhappiness. An ethical decisionbased on the utilitarian view looks at the end resultsof the decision. Action is taken based on the end re-sults that produced the most good (happiness) forthe most people. Kantianism Named for philosopher Immanuel Kant, Kantianismis directly opposed to utilitarianism. Kant argued thatit is not the consequences or end results that make anaction right or wrong; rather it is the principle or motivation on which the action is based that is themorally decisive factor. Kantianism suggests that ouractions are bound by a sense of duty. This theory isoften called deontology (from the Greek word deon, which means \"that which is binding; duty\"). Kantian-directed ethical decisions are made out of respect formoral law. For example, \"I make this choice becauseit is morally right and my duty to do so\" (not becauseof consideration for a possible outcome). Christian Ethics This approach to ethical decision making is focusedon the way of life and teachings of Jesus Christ. It advances the importance of virtues such as love, for-giveness, and honesty. One basic principle often asso-ciated with Christian ethics is known as the goldenrule: \"Do unto others as you would have them dounto you.\" The imperative demand of Christian ethics is that all decisions about right and wrong should becentered in love for God and in treating others withthe same respect and dignity with which we would expect to be treated. Natural Law Theory Natural law theory is based on the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas. It advances the idea that deci-sions about right versus wrong are self-evident anddetermined by human nature. The theory espousesthat, as rational human beings, we inherently knowthe difference between good and evil (believed tobe knowledge that is given to man from God), andthis knowledge directs our decision making. Ethical Egoism Ethical egoism espouses that what is right and good is what is best for the individual making the decision.An individual's actions are determined by what is tohis or her own advantage. The action may not be bestfor anyone else involved, but consideration is only forthe individual making the decision. Ethical Dilemmas An ethical dilemma is a situation that requires an in- dividual to make a choice between two equally un-favorable alternatives (Catalano, 2012). Evidenceexists to support both moral \"rightness\" and moral\"wrongness\" related to a certain action. The individ-ual who must make the choice experiences consciousconflict regarding the decision. Not all ethical issues are dilemmas. An ethical dilemma arises when there is no clear reason tochoose one action over another. Ethical dilemmasgenerally create a great deal of emotion. Often thereasons supporting each side of the argument for action are logical and appropriate. The actions asso-ciated with both sides are desirable in some respectsand undesirable in others. In most situations, takingno action is considered an action taken. Ethical Principles Ethical principles are fundamental guidelines thatinfluence decision making. The ethical principles ofautonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, veracity,and justice are helpful and used frequently byhealth-care workers to assist with ethical decisionmaking. Autonomy The principle of autonomy arises from the Kantian duty of respect for persons as rational agents. Thisviewpoint emphasizes the status of persons as au-tonomous moral agents whose right to determinetheir destinies should always be respected. This pre-sumes that individuals are always capable of makingindependent choices for themselves. Health-careworkers know this is not always the case. Children,comatose individuals, and people with serious mentalillness are examples of clients who are incapable ofmaking informed choices. In these instances, a rep-resentative of the individual is usually asked to inter-vene and give consent. However, health-care workersmust ensure that respect for an individual's autonomy80 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing4092_Ch05_078-094 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 80is not disregarded in favor of what another person may view as best for the client. Beneficence Beneficence refers to one's duty to benefit or pro- mote the good of others. Health-care workers who actin their clients' interests are beneficent, providedtheir actions really do serve the client's best interest.In fact, some duties do seem to take preference overother duties. For example, the duty to respect the au-tonomy of an individual may be overridden when thatindividual has been deemed harmful to self or others.Aiken (2004) stated, \"The difficulty that sometimesarises in implementing the principle of beneficencelies in determining what exactly is good for anotherand who can best make that decision\" (p. 109). Peplau (1991) recognized client advocacy as an essential role for the psychiatric nurse. The term ad-vocacy means acting in another's behalf\u2014being a supporter or defender. Being a client advocate inpsychiatric nursing means helping the client fulfillneeds that, without assistance and because of theclient's illness, may go unfulfilled. Individuals withmental illness are not always able to speak for them-selves. Nurses serve in this manner to protect theclient's rights and interests. Strategies include edu-cating clients and their families about their legalrights, ensuring that clients have sufficient informa-tion to make informed decisions or to give informedconsent, and assisting clients to consider alternativesand supporting them in the decisions they make. Additionally, nurses may act as advocates by speakingon behalf of individuals with mental illness to secureessential mental health services. Nonmaleficence Nonmaleficence is the requirement that health-care providers do no harm to their clients, either inten-tionally or unintentionally (Aiken, 2004). Somephilosophers suggest that this principle is more im-portant than beneficence; that is, they support thenotion that it is more important to avoid doingharm than it is to do good. In any event, ethicaldilemmas often arise when a conflict exists betweenan individual's rights and what is thought to bestrepresent the welfare of the individual. An exampleof this conflict might occur when a psychiatric clientrefuses antipsychotic medication (consistent withhis or her rights), and the nurse must then decidehow to maintain client safety while psychotic symp-toms continue. Justice The principle of justice has been referred to as the \"justice as fairness\" principle. It is sometimes referred to as distributive justice, and its basic premiselies with the right of individuals to be treatedequally regardless of race, sex, marital status, med-ical diagnosis, social standing, economic level, or re-ligious belief (Aiken, 2004). The concept of justicereflects a duty to treat all individuals equally andfairly. When applied to health care, this principlesuggests that all resources within the society (includ-ing health-care services) ought to be distributedevenly without respect to socioeconomic status.Thus, according to this principle, the vast disparityin the quality of care dispensed to the various classeswithin our society would be considered unjust. Amore equitable distribution of care for all individu-als would be favored. Veracity The principle of veracity refers to one's duty to always be truthful. Aiken (2004) stated, \"Veracity requires that the health-care provider tell the truthand not intentionally deceive or mislead clients\" (p. 109). There are times when limitations must beplaced on this principle, such as when the truthwould knowingly produce harm or interfere withthe recovery process. Being honest is not alwayseasy, but rarely is lying justified. Clients have theright to know about their diagnosis, treatment, andprognosis. A Model for Making Ethical Decisions The following is a set of steps that may be used inmaking an ethical decision. These steps closely resem-ble the steps of the nursing process. 1. Assessment: Gather the subjective and objective data about a situation. Consider personal values aswell as values of others involved in the ethicaldilemma. 2. Problem identification: Identify the conflict be- tween two or more alternative actions. 3. Planning: a. Explore the benefits and consequences of each alternative. b. Consider principles of ethical theories. c. Select an alternative. 4. Implementation: Act on the decision made and communicate the decision to others. 5. Evaluation: Evaluate outcomes. A schematic of this model is presented in Figure 5-1. A case study using this decision-making model is pre-sented in Box 5-2. If the outcome is acceptable, actioncontinues in the manner selected. If the outcome is un-acceptable, benefits and consequences of the remainingalternatives are reexamined, and steps 3 through 7 inBox 5-2 are repeated.CHAPTER 5 Ethical and Legal Issues in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing 814092_Ch05_078-094 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 81Ethical Issues in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing The Right to Refuse Medication The AHA's (1992) Patient's Bill of Rights states: \"The patient has the right to refuse treatment to the extentpermitted by law, and to be informed of the medicalconsequences of his action.\" In psychiatry, refusal oftreatment primarily concerns the administration ofpsychotropic medications. \"To the extent permittedby law\" may be defined within the U.S. Constitutionand several of its amendments (e.g., the First Amend-ment, which addresses the rights of speech, thought,and expression; the Eighth Amendment, which grantsthe right to freedom from cruel and unusual punish-ment; and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments,which grant due process of law and equal protectionfor all). In psychiatry, \"the medical consequences ofhis action\" may include such steps as involuntary com-mitment, legal competency hearing, or client dis-charge from the hospital. Although many courts are supporting a client's right to refuse medications in the psychiatric area,some limitations do exist. Weiss-Kaffie and Purtell(2001) stated: The treatment team must determine that three criteria be met to force medication without clientconsent. The client must exhibit behavior that is dan-gerous to self or others; the medication ordered by82 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing Assessment of a Situation A problem that requires action is identified Conflict exists between alternatives Action B Action AEthical conflict exists Benefits Consequences Consequences Benefits Consider principles of ethical theories 1.

BOX 5-2 Ethical Decision Making\u2014A Case Study STEP 1: ASSESSMENT Tonja is a 17-year-old girl who is currently on the psychiatricunit with a diagnosis of conduct disorder . Tonja reports that she has been sexually active since she was 14. She had anabortion when she was 15 and a second one just 6 weeksago. She states that her mother told her she has \"had herlast abortion,\" and that she has to start taking birth controlpills. She asks her nurse, Kimberly, to give her some infor-mation about the pills and to tell her how to go about get-ting some. Kimberly believes Tonja desperately needsinformation about birth control pills, as well as other typesof contraceptives, but the psychiatric unit is part of a Catholichospital, and hospital policy prohibits distributing this typeof information. STEP 2: PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION A conflict exists between the client's need for information,the nurse's desire to provide that information, and the insti-tution's policy prohibiting the provision of that information. STEP 3: ALTERNATIVES\u2014BENEFITS AND CONSE QUENCES 1. Alternative 1: Give the client information and risk losing job.2. Alternative 2: Do not give client information and compro- mise own values of holistic nursing. 3. Alternative 3: Refer client to another source outside the hospital and risk reprimand from supervisor. STEP 4: CONSIDER PRINCIPLES OF ETHICAL THE ORIES 1. Alternative 1: Giving the client information would certainly respect the client's autonomy and would benefit the clientby decreasing her chances of becoming pregnant again.It would not be to the best advantage of Kimberly , in that she would likely lose her job. And according to the beliefsof the Catholic hospital, the natural laws of God would beviolated. 2. Alternative 2: Withholding information restricts the client's autonomy. It has the potential for doing harm, in thatwithout the use of contraceptives, the client may becomepregnant again (and she implies that this is not what shewants). Kimberly's Christian ethic is violated in that thisaction is not what she would want \"done unto her.\" 3. Alternative 3: A referral would respect the client's auton- omy, would promote good, would do no harm (exceptperhaps to Kimberly's ego from the possible reprimand),4092_Ch05_078-094 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 82the physician must have a reasonable chance of pro- viding help to the client; and clients who refuse med-ication must be judged incompetent to evaluate thebenefits of the treatment in question. (p. 361) The Right to the Least-Restrictive Treatment Alternative Health-care personnel must attempt to provide treat- ment in a manner that least restricts the freedom ofclients. The \"restrictiveness\" of psychiatric therapycan be described in the context of a continuum,based on severity of illness. Clients may be treatedon an outpatient basis, in day hospitals, or through voluntary or involuntary hospitalization. Symptomsmay be treated with verbal rehabilitative techniquesand move successively to behavioral techniques,chemical interventions, mechanical restraints, orelectroconvulsive therapy. The problem appears toarise in selecting the least restrictive means amonginvoluntary chemical intervention, seclusion, andmechanical restraints. Sadock and Sadock (2007)stated: Distinguishing among these interventions on the basis of restrictiveness proves to be a purely subjectiveexercise fraught with personal bias. Moreover, eachof these three interventions is both more and less re-strictive than each of the other two. Nevertheless, theeffort should be made to think in terms of restrictive-ness when deciding how to treat patients. (p. 1376) Legal Considerations The Patient Self-determination Act, as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990,went into effect on December 1, 1991. Cady (2010)states: The Patient Self-determination Act requires health- care facilities to provide clear written information forevery patient concerning his/her legal rights to makehealthcare decisions, including the right to accept orrefuse treatment. (p. 118) Box 5-3 lists the rights of patients affirmed by this law. Nurse Practice Acts The legal parameters of professional and practical nursing are defined within each state by the state'snurse practice act. These documents are passed bythe state legislature and in general are concernedwith such provisions as the following: The definition of important terms, including thedefinition of nursing and the various types ofnurses recognized A statement of the education and other training orrequirements for licensure and reciprocity Broad statements that describe the scope of prac-tice for various levels of nursing (APN, RN, LPN) Conditions under which a nurse's license may be suspended or revoked, and instructions for appeal The general authority and powers of the stateboard of nursing Most nurse practice acts are general in their termi- nology and do not provide specific guidelines forpractice. Nurses must understand the scope of prac-tice that is protected by their license, and should seekCHAPTER 5 Ethical and Legal Issues in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing 83 BOX 5-2 Ethical Decision Making\u2014A Case Study\u2014cont'd and this decision would comply with Kimberly's Christian ethic. STEP 5: SELECT AN ALTERNATIVEAlternative 3 is selected based on the ethical theories of utilitarianism (does the most good for the g reatest number), Christian ethics (Kimberly's belief of \"Do unto others as youwould have others do unto you\"), and Kantianism (to per-form one's duty), and the ethical principles of autonomy , beneficence, and nonmaleficence. The success of this deci-sion depends on the client's follow-through with the referraland compliance with use of the contraceptives. STEP 6: TAKE ACTION AND COMMUNI C ATE Taking action involves providing information in writing for Tonja, perhaps making a phone call and setting up an appointment for her with Planned Parenthood. Communi-cating suggests sharing the information with Tonja's mother.Communication also includes documentation of the referralin the client's chart.STEP 7: EVALUATE THE OUTCOMEAn acceptable outcome might indicate that Tonja did indeedkeep her appointment at Planned P arenthood and is com- plying with the prescribed contraceptive reg imen. It might also include Kimberly's input into the change process in herinstitution to implement these types of referrals to otherclients who request them. An unacceptable outcome might be indicated by Tonja's lack of follow-through with the appointment at PlannedParenthood or lack of compliance in using the contracep-tives, resulting in another pregnancy. Kimberly may alsoview a reprimand from her supervisor as an unacceptableoutcome, particularly if she is told that she must selectother alternatives should this situation arise in the future.This may motivate Kimberly to make another decision\u2014that of seeking employment in an institution that supportsa philosophy more consistent with her own.4092_Ch05_078-094 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 83assistance from legal counsel if they are unsure about the proper interpretation of a nurse practice act. Types of Law There are two general categories or types of law thatare of most concern to nurses: statutory law and com-mon law. These laws are identified by their source ororigin. Statutory Law Astatutory law is a law that has been enacted by a legislative body, such as a county or city council, statelegislature, or the U.S. Congress. An example ofstatutory law is the nurse practice acts. Common Law Common laws are derived from decisions made in pre- vious cases. These laws apply to a body of principlesthat evolve from court decisions resolving various con-troversies. Because common law in the United Stateshas been developed on a state basis, the law on spe-cific subjects may differ from state to state. An exam-ple of a common law might be how different statesdeal with a nurse's refusal to provide care for a spe-cific client. Classifications Within Statutory and Common Law Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of unlawful acts: civil and criminal. Both statutory law and com-mon law have civil and criminal components. Civil Law Civil law protects the private and property rights of individuals and businesses. Private individuals orgroups may bring a legal action to court for breachof civil law. These legal actions are of two basic types:torts and contracts. Torts A tortis a violation of a civil law in which an individual has been wronged. In a tort action, one party assertsthat wrongful conduct on the part of the other hascaused harm, and seeks compensation for harm suf-fered. A tort may be intentional or unintentional. Ex- amples of unintentional torts are malpractice and84 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing BOX 5-3 Patient Self-determination Act\u2014Patient Rights 1.

An example of an intentional tort is the touching of another person without that per-son's consent. Intentional touching (e.g., a medicaltreatment) without the client's consent can result ina charge of battery, an intentional tort. Contracts In a contract action, one party asserts that the otherparty, in failing to fulfill an obligation, has breachedthe contract, and either compensation or perform-ance of the obligation is sought as remedy. An exam-ple is an action by a mental health professional whoseclinical privileges have been reduced or terminatedin violation of an implied contract between the pro-fessional and a hospital. Criminal Law Criminal law provides protection from conduct deemed injurious to the public welfare. It providesfor punishment of those found to have engaged insuch conduct, which commonly includes imprison-ment, parole conditions, a loss of privilege (such asa license), a fine, or any combination of these (Ellis& Hartley, 2012). An example of a violation of crim-inal law is the theft by a hospital employee of sup-plies or drugs. Legal Issues in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing Confidentiality and Right to Privacy The Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution protect an individual's privacy.Most states have statutes protecting the confidentialityof client records and communications. The only in-dividuals who have a right to observe a client or haveaccess to medical information are those involved inhis or her medical care.HIPPA Until 1996, client confidentiality in medical recordswas not protected by federal law. In August 1996, Pres-ident Clinton signed the Health Insurance Portabilityand Accountability Act (HIPAA) into law. Under thislaw, individuals have the rights to access their medicalrecords, to have corrections made to their medicalrecords, and to decide with whom their medical infor-mation may be shared. The actual document belongsto the facility or the therapist, but the informationcontained therein belongs to the client. This federal privacy rule pertains to data that is called protected health information (PHI) and applies to most individuals and institutions involved in healthcare. Notice of privacy policies must be provided toclients upon entry into the health-care system. PHI isindividually identifiable health information indicatorsthat \"relate to past, present, or future physical or men-tal health or condition of the individual, or the past,present, or future payment for the provision of healthcare to an individual; and (1) that identifies the indi-vidual; or (2) with respect to which there is a reason-able basis to believe the information can be used toidentify the individual\" (U.S. Department of Healthand Human Services, 2003). These specific identifiersare listed in Box 5-4. Pertinent medical information may be released without consent in a life-threatening situation. If in-formation is released in an emergency, the followinginformation must be recorded in the client's record:date of disclosure, person to whom information wasdisclosed, reason for disclosure, reason written con-sent could not be obtained, and the specific informa-tion disclosed. Most states have statutes that pertain to the doctrine of privileged communication.

In most states, the doctrine of privilegedcommunication applies to psychiatrists and attorneys;in some instances, psychologists, clergy, and nurses arealso included. In certain instances nurses may be called on to testify in cases in which the medical record is used asevidence. In most states, the right to privacy of theserecords is exempted in civil or criminal proceedings.Therefore, it is important that nurses document withthese possibilities in mind. Strict record keepingusing statements that are objective and nonjudgmen-tal, having care plans that are specific in their pre-scriptive interventions, and keeping documentationthat describes those interventions and their subse-quent evaluation all serve the best interests of theclient, the nurse, and the institution should questionsregarding care arise. Documentation very oftenweighs heavily in malpractice case decisions. The right to confidentiality is a basic one, and especially so in psychiatry. Although societal attitudesare improving, individuals have experienced discrim-ination in the past for no other reason than for hav-ing a history of emotional illness. Nurses working inpsychiatry must guard the privacy of their clients withgreat diligence. Exception: A Duty to Warn (Protection of a Third Party) There are exceptions to the laws of privacy and con- fidentiality. One of these exceptions stems from the1974 case of Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California. The incident from which this case evolved came about in the late 1960s. A young man fromBengal, India (Mr. P.), who was a graduate student atthe University of California (UC), Berkeley, fell inlove with another university student (Ms. Tarasoff).Because she was not interested in an exclusive rela-tionship with Mr. P., he became very resentful andangry. He began to stalk her and to record some oftheir conversations in an effort to determine why shedidn't love him. He soon became very depressed andneglected his health, appearance, and studies. Ms. Tarasoff spent the summer of 1969 in South America. During this time Mr. P. entered therapy witha psychologist at UC. He confided in the psychologistthat he intended to kill his former girlfriend (identi-fying her by name) when she returned from vacation.The psychologist recommended civil commitment forMr. P., claiming he was suffering from acute and se-vere paranoid schizophrenia. Mr. P. was picked up bythe campus police but released a short time later be-cause he appeared rational and promised to stay awayfrom Ms. Tarasoff. Neither Ms. Tarasoff nor her par-ents received any warning of the threat of Mr. P.'s in-tention to kill her. When Ms. Tarasoff returned to campus in October 1969, Mr. P. resumed his stalking behavior and even-tually stabbed her to death. Ms. Tarasoff's parentssued the psychologist, several psychiatrists, and theuniversity for failure to warn. The case was referredto the California Supreme Court, which ruled that amental health professional has a duty not only to aclient, but also to individuals who are being threat-ened by that client. The Court stated: Once a therapist does in fact determine, or under applicable professional standards should have determined, that a patient poses a serious dangerof violence to others, he bears a duty to exercisereasonable care to protect the foreseeable victim ofthat danger. While the discharge of this duty of duecare will necessarily vary with the facts of each case,in each instance the adequacy of the therapist'sconduct must be measured against the traditionalnegligence standard of reasonable care under thecircumstances. (Tarasoff v. Regents of University of California, 1974a) The defendants argued that warning the woman or her family would have breached professional ethics and violated the client's right to privacy. Butthe court ruled that \"the confidential character ofpatient-psychotherapist communications must yieldto the extent that disclosure is essential to avert danger to others. The protective privilege endswhere the public peril begins\" (Tarasoff v. Regents ofUniversity of California, 1974b). In 1976, the California Supreme Court expanded the original case ruling (now referred to as Tarasoff I). The second ruling (known as Tarasoff II) broadenedthe ruling of \"duty to warn\" to include \"duty to protect.\" They stated that, under certain circum-stances, a therapist might be required to warn an individual, notify police, or take whatever steps arenecessary to protect the intended victim from harm.This duty to protect can also \"occur in instances whenpatients, because of their vulnerable state and theirinability to distinguish potentially harmful situations,must be protected by healthcare providers\" (Guido,2010, p. 413). The Tarasoff rulings created a great deal of contro- versy in the psychiatric community regarding breachof confidentiality and the subsequent negative impacton the client-therapist relationship. However, moststates now recognize that therapists have ethical andlegal obligations to prevent their clients from harm-ing themselves or others. Many states have passedtheir own variations on the original \"protect andwarn\" legislation, but in most cases, courts have 86 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing4092_Ch05_078-094 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 86outlined the following guidelines for therapists to fol- low in determining their obligation to take protectivemeasures: 1.Assessment of a threat of violence by a client to-ward another individual 2.Identification of the intended victim 3.Ability to intervene in a feasible, meaningful wayto protect the intended victim When these guidelines apply to a specific situation, it is reasonable for the therapist to notify the victim,law enforcement authorities, and/or relatives of theintended victim. They may also consider initiating vol-untary or involuntary commitment of the client in an effort to prevent potential violence. Implications for Nursing Advanced practice psychi- atric nurses who are licensed to practice independ- ently would be held to the same duty as othertherapists. Generalist psychiatric nurses who are notacting independently, but rather under the supervi- sion of a psychiatrist, nevertheless have a responsi-bility to protect a third party who is being threatenedby the client. If a client confides in the nurse the po-tential for harm to an intended victim, it is the dutyof the nurse to report this information to the psychi-atrist or to other team members. This is not a breachof confidentiality and the nurse may be considerednegligent for failure to do so. All members of thetreatment team must be made aware of the potentialdanger that the client poses to self or others. De-tailed written documentation of the situation is alsoessential. Informed Consent According to law, all individuals have the right to de-cide whether to accept or reject treatment. A health-care provider can be charged with assault and batteryfor providing life-sustaining treatment to a clientwhen the client has not agreed to it. The rationale forthe doctrine of informed consent is the preservation and protection of individual autonomy in determin-ing what will and will not happen to the person's body(Guido, 2010). Informed consent is a client's permission granted to a physician to perform a therapeutic procedure,before which information about the procedure hasbeen presented to the client with adequate time givenfor consideration about the pros and cons. The clientshould receive information such as what treatment al-ternatives are available; why the physician believes thistreatment is most appropriate; the possible outcomes,risks, and adverse effects; the possible outcomeshould the client select another treatment alternative;and the possible outcome should the client choose tohave no treatment. An example of a treatment in thepsychiatric area that requires informed consent iselectroconvulsive therapy. There are some conditions under which treatment may be performed without obtaining informed con-sent. A client's refusal to accept treatment may bechallenged under the following circumstances:(Aiken, 2004; Guido, 2010; Levy & Rubenstein, 1996;Mackay, 2001): 1.When a client is mentally incompetent to make adecision and treatment is necessary to preserve life or avoid serious harm 2.When refusing treatment endangers the life orhealth of another 3.During an emergency, in which a client is in nocondition to exercise judgment 4.When the client is a child (consent is obtainedfrom parent or surrogate) 5.In the case of therapeutic privilege: Informationabout a treatment may be withheld if the physiciancan show that full disclosure would a. hinder or complicate necessar y treatment b. cause severe psychological harm, or c. be so upsetting as to render a rational decision by the client impossible Although most clients in psychiatric/mental health facilities are competent and capable of giving in-formed consent, those with severe psychiatric illnessdo not possess the cognitive ability to do so. If an in-dividual has been legally determined to be mentallyincompetent, consent is obtained from the legalguardian. Difficulty arises when no legal determina-tion has been made, but the individual's current men-tal state prohibits informed decision making (e.g., the person who is psychotic, unconscious, or inebri-ated). In these instances, informed consent is usually obtained from the individual's nearest relative, or ifnone exist and time permits, the physician may askthe court to appoint a conservator or guardian. Whentime does not permit court intervention, permissionmay be sought from the hospital administrator. A client or guardian always has the right to with- draw consent after it has been given. When this oc-curs, the physician should inform (or re-inform) theclient about the consequences of refusing treatment.If treatment has already been initiated, the physicianshould terminate treatment in a way least likely tocause injury to the client and inform the client orguardian of the risks associated with interrupted treat-ment (Guido, 2010). The nurse's role in obtaining informed consent is usually defined by agency policy. A nurse may signthe consent form as witness for the client's signature.However, legal liability for informed consent lieswith the physician. The nurse acts as client advocateCHAPTER 5 Ethical and Legal Issues in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing 874092_Ch05_078-094 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 87to ensure that the following three major elements of informed consent have been addressed: 1. Knowledge: The client has received adequate in- formation on which to base his or her decision. 2. Competency: The individual's cognition is not impaired to an extent that would interfere with decision making or , if so, that the individual has a legal representative. 3. Free will: The individual has given consent volun- tarily without pressure or coercion from others. Restraints and Seclusion An individual's privacy and personal security areprotected by the Patient Self-determination Act of1991. This legislation includes a set of patient rights,one of which is an individual's right to freedomfrom restraint or seclusion except in an emergencysituation. The use of seclusion and restraint as atherapeutic intervention for psychiatric patients hasbeen controversial and many efforts have beenmade through federal and state regulations andthrough standards set forth by accrediting bodies tominimize or eliminate its use. Because there havebeen injuries and deaths associated with restraintand seclusion, this treatment requires careful atten-tion when it is used. Further, the laws, regulations,accreditation standards, and hospital policies arefrequently being revised so it is important for any-one practicing in inpatient psychiatric settings to bewell informed in each of these areas. In psychiatry, the term restraints generally refers to a set of leather straps that are used to restrain theextremities of an individual whose behavior is out of control and who poses an immediate risk to thephysical safety and psychological well-being of the in-dividual and others. It is important to note, however,that the current generally accepted definition of re-straint refers not only to leather restraints but ratherto any manual method or medication used to restricta person's freedom of movement (The Joint Commis-sion, 2010). Restraints are never to be used as punish-ment or for the convenience of staff. Other measuresto decrease agitation, such as \"talking down\" (verbalintervention) and chemical restraints (tranquilizingmedication) are usually tried first. If these interven-tions are ineffective, mechanical restraints may be instituted (although some controversy exists as towhether chemical restraints are indeed less restrictivethan mechanical restraints). Seclusion is another type of physical restraint in which the client is confinedalone in a room from which he or she is unable toleave. The room is usually minimally furnished withitems to promote the client's comfort and safety. The Joint Commission, an association that accred- its health-care organizations, has established specificstandards regarding the use of seclusion and restraint.Some examples of current standards include the fol-lowing (The Joint Commission, 2010): 1.Seclusion or restraint is discontinued at the earliestpossible time regardless of when the order is sched-uled to expire. 2.Unless state law is more restrictive, orders for re-straint or seclusion must be renewed every 4 hours for adults ages 18 and older , every 2 hours for chil- dren and adolescents ages 9 to 17, and every hour for children younger than 9 years. Orders may berenewed according to these time limits for a max-imum of 24 consecutive hours. 3.An in-person evaluation (by a physician, clinicalpsychologist, or other licensed independent prac-titioner responsible for the care of the patient)must be conducted within 1 hour of initiating restraint or seclusion. Appropriately trained regis-tered nurses and physician assistants may also con-duct this assessment but they must consult with thephysician. 4.Patients who are simultaneously restrained and se-cluded must be continuously monitored by trainedstaff, either in person or through audio or videoequipment positioned near the patient. 5.Staff who are involved in restraining and secludingpatients are trained to monitor the physical andpsychological well-being of the patient including(but not limited to) respiratory and circulator y sta- tus, skin integrity, and vital signs. The laws, regulations, accreditation standards, and hospital policies pertaining to restraint and seclusionshare a common priority of maintaining patient safetyfor a procedure that has the potential to incur injuryor death. The importance of close and careful moni-toring cannot be overstated. False imprisonment is the deliberate and unautho- rized confinement of a person within fixed limits bythe use of verbal or physical means (Ellis & Hartley,2012). Health-care workers may be charged with falseimprisonment for restraining or secluding\u2014againstthe wishes of the client\u2014anyone having been admit-ted to the hospital voluntarily. Should a voluntarily ad-mitted client decompensate to a point that restraintor seclusion for protection of self or others is neces-sary, court intervention to determine competency andinvoluntary commitment is required to preserve theclient's rights to privacy and freedom. Commitment Issues Voluntary Admissions Each year, more than one million persons are admit-ted to health-care facilities for psychiatric treatment;of these admissions, approximately two-thirds are 88 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing4092_Ch05_078-094 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 88considered voluntary. To be admitted voluntarily, an individual makes direct application to the institutionfor services and may stay as long as treatment isdeemed necessary. He or she may sign out of the hospital at any time unless, following a mental statusexamination, the health-care professional determinesthat the client may be harmful to self or others andrecommends that the admission status be changedfrom voluntary to involuntary. Although these typesof admissions are considered voluntary, it is importantto ensure that the individual comprehends the mean-ing of his or her actions, has not been coerced in anymanner, and is willing to proceed with admission. Involuntary Commitment Because involuntary hospitalization results in substan-tial restrictions of the rights of an individual, the admission process is subject to the guarantee of theFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution thatprovides citizens protection against loss of liberty andensures due process rights (Weiss-Kaffie & Purtell,2001). Involuntary commitments are made for vari-ous reasons. Most states commonly cite the followingcriteria: In an emergency situation (for the client who isdangerous to self or others) For observation and treatment of mentally ill persons When an individual is unable to take care of basicpersonal needs (the \"gravely disabled\") Under the Fourth Amendment, individuals are protected from unlawful searches and seizures with-out probable cause. Therefore, the individual seekingthe involuntary commitment must show probablecause why the client should be hospitalized againsthis or her wishes; that is, the person must show thatthere is cause to believe that the person would be dan-gerous to self or others, is mentally ill and in need oftreatment, or is gravely disabled. Emergency Commitments Emergency commitments are sought when an indi-vidual manifests behavior that is clearly and immi-nently dangerous to self or others. These admissionsare usually instigated by relatives or friends of the individual, police officers, the court, or health-careprofessionals. Emergency commitments are time-limited, and a court hearing for the individual isscheduled, usually within 72 hours. At that time thecourt may decide that the client may be discharged;or, if deemed necessary, and voluntary admission isrefused by the client, an additional period of involun-tary commitment may be ordered. In most instances,another hearing is scheduled for a specified time(usually in 7 to 21 days).The Mentally Ill Person in Need of Treatment A second type of involuntary commitment is for theobservation and treatment of mentally ill persons inneed of treatment. Most states have established defi-nitions of what constitutes \"mentally ill\" for purposesof state involuntary admission statutes. Some exam-ples include individuals who, because of severe men-tal illness, are: Unable to make informed decisions concerningtreatment Likely to cause harm to self or others Unable to fulfill basic personal needs necessary forhealth and safety In determining whether commitment is required, the court looks for substantial evidence of abnormalconduct\u2014evidence that cannot be explained as theresult of a physical cause. There must be \"clear andconvincing evidence\" as well as \"probable cause\" tosubstantiate the need for involuntary commitment toensure that an individual's rights under the Constitu-tion are protected. The U.S. Supreme Court, in O'Connor v. Donaldson, held that the existence of men-tal illness alone does not justify involuntary hospital-ization. State standards require a specific impact orconsequence to flow from the mental illness that in-volves danger or an inability to care for one's ownneeds. These clients are entitled to court hearingswith representation, at which time determination ofcommitment and length of stay are considered. Leg-islative statutes governing involuntary commitmentsvary from state to state. Involuntary Outpatient Commitment Involuntary outpatient commitment (IOC) is a court-ordered mechanism used to compel a person withmental illness to submit to treatment on an outpatientbasis. A number of eligibility criteria for commitmentto outpatient treatment have been cited (Appelbaum,2001; Maloy, 1996; Torrey & Zdanowicz, history of repeated decompensation requiringinvoluntary hospitalization Likelihood that without treatment the individualwill deteriorate to the point of requiring inpatientcommitment Presence of severe and persistent mental illness(e.g., schizophrenia or bipolar disorder) and lim-ited awareness of the illness or need for treatment The presence of severe and persistent mental ill-ness contributing to a risk of becoming homeless,incarcerated, or violent, or of committing suicide The existence of individualized treatment planlikely to be effective and a service provider who hasagreed to provide the treatmentCHAPTER 5 Ethical and Legal Issues in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing 894092_Ch05_078-094 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 89Most states have already enacted IOC legislation or currently have resolutions that speak to this topic on their agendas. Most commonly, clients who are com-mitted into the IOC programs are those with severeand persistent mental illness, such as schizophrenia.The rationale behind the legislation is to improve pre-ventive care and reduce the number of readmissionsand lengths of hospital stays of these clients. The needfor this kind of legislation arose after it was recognizedthat patients with schizophrenia who did not meet cri-teria for involuntary hospital treatment were, in somecases, ultimately dangerous to themselves or others. InNew York, public attention to this need arose after aman with schizophrenia who had stopped taking hismedication pushed a young woman into the path of asubway train. He would not have met criteria for invol-untary hospitalization until he was deemed dangerousto others, but advocates for this legislation argued thatthere should be provisions to prevent violence ratherthan waiting until it happens. The subsequent law gov-erning IOC in New York became known as Kendra'sLaw in reference to the woman who was pushed to herdeath. Opponents of this legislation fear that it may violate the individual rights of psychiatric clients with-out significant improvement in outcomes. Some research studies have attempted to evaluate whether IOC improves care, reduces lengths of stayin the hospital, and/or reduces episodes of violence.One study at Bellevue hospital in New York found nodifference in treatment outcomes between court-ordered outpatient treatment and voluntary outpa-tient treatment (Steadman et al., 2001). Other studieshave shown positive outcomes, including a decreasein hospital readmissions, with IOC (Ridgely, Borum,& Petrila, 2001; Swartz et al., 2001). Continuing re-search is required to determine if IOC will improvetreatment compliance and enhance quality of life inthe community for individuals with severe and persist-ent mental illness. The Gravely Disabled Client A number of states have statutes that specifically de-fine the \"gravely disabled\" client. For those that donot use this label, the description of the individualwho, because of mental illness, is unable to take careof basic personal needs is very similar. Gravely disabled is generally defined as a condition in which an individual, as a result of mental illness,is in danger of serious physical harm resulting frominability to provide for basic needs such as food,clothing, shelter, medical care, and personal safety.Inability to care for oneself cannot be established byshowing that an individual lacks the resources to pro-vide the necessities of life. Rather, it is the inability tomake use of available resources.Should it be determined that an individual is gravely disabled, a guardian, conservator, or commit-tee will be appointed by the court to ensure the man-agement of the person and his or her estate. To legallyrestore competency then requires another court hear-ing to reverse the previous ruling. The individualwhose competency is being determined has the rightto be represented by an attorney. Nursing Liability Mental health practitioners\u2014psychiatrists, psychol-ogists, psychiatric nurses, and social workers\u2014havea duty to provide appropriate care based on thestandards of their professions and the standards setby law. The standards of care for psychiatric/mentalhealth nursing are presented in Chapter 9. Malpractice and Negligence The terms malpractice and negligence are often used interchangeably. Negligence has been defined as: The failure to exercise the standard of care that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised ina similar situation; any conduct that falls below thelegal standard established to protect others againstunreasonable risk of harm, except for conduct thatis intentionally, wantonly, or willfully disregardfulof others' rights. (Garner, 2011) Any person may be negligent. In contrast, malprac- tice is a specialized form of negligence applicable only to professionals. Black's Law Dictionary defines malpractice as: An instance of negligence or incompetence on the part of a professional. To succeed in a malpracticeclaim, a plaintiff must also prove proximate cause anddamages. (Garner, 2011) In the absence of any state statutes, common law is the basis of liability for injuries to clients caused by acts of malpractice and negligence of individual prac-titioners. In other words, most decisions of negligencein the professional setting are based on legal prece-dent (decisions that have previously been made aboutsimilar cases) rather than any specific action taken bythe legislature. To summarize, when the breach of duty is charac- terized as malpractice, the action is weighed againstthe professional standard. When it is brought forth asnegligence, action is contrasted with what a reason-ably prudent professional would have done in thesame or similar circumstances. Austin (2011) cites the following basic elements of a nursing malpractice lawsuit: 1.A duty to the patient existed, based on the recog-nized standard of care.90 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing4092_Ch05_078-094 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 902.A breach of duty occurred, meaning that the care rendered was not consistent with the recognizedstandard of care. 3.The client was injured. 4.The injury was directly caused by the breach of astandard of care. For the client to prevail in a malpractice claim, each of these elements must be proved. Juries' deci-sions are generally based on the testimony of expertwitnesses, because members of the jury are laypeople and cannot be expected to know what nursing inter-ventions should have been carried out. Without thetestimony of expert witnesses, a favorable verdict usu-ally goes to the defendant nurse. Types of Lawsuits That Occur in Psychiatric Nursing Most malpractice suits against nurses are civil actions;that is, they are considered breach of conduct actionson the part of the professional, for which compensa-tion is being sought. The nurse in the psychiatric set-ting should be aware of the types of behaviors thatmay result in charges of malpractice. Basic to the psychiatric client's hospitalization is his or her right to confidentiality and privacy. A nursemay be charged with breach of confidentiality for reveal- ing aspects about a client's case, or even for revealingthat an individual has been hospitalized, if that per-son can show that making this information known re-sulted in harm. When shared information is detrimental to the client's reputation, the person sharing the informa-tion may be liable for defamation of character . When the information is in writing, the action is called libel. Oral defamation is called slander . Defamation of character involves communication that is maliciousand false (Ellis & Hartley, 2012). Occasionally, libelarises out of critical, judgmental statements written inthe client's medical record. Nurses need to be veryobjective in their charting, backing up all statementswith factual evidence. Invasion of privacy is a charge that may result when a client is searched without probable cause. Many in-stitutions conduct body searches on clients with men-tal illness as a routine intervention. In these cases,there should be a physician's order and written ra-tionale showing probable cause for the intervention.Many institutions are reexamining their policies re-garding this procedure. Assault is an act that results in a person's genuine fear and apprehension that he or she will be touchedwithout consent. Battery is the unconsented touching of another person. These charges can result when atreatment is administered to a client against his or herwishes and outside of an emergency situation. Harmor injury need not have occurred for these charges tobe legitimate. For confining a client against his or her wishes, and outside of an emergency situation, the nurse may becharged with false imprisonment. Examples of actionsthat may invoke these charges include locking an in-dividual in a room; taking a client's clothes for pur-poses of detainment against his or her will; andretaining in mechanical restraints a competent volun-tary client who demands to be released. Avoiding Liability Hall and Hall (2001) suggested the following proac-tive nursing actions in an effort to avoid nursingmalpractice: 1.Responding to the patient 2.Educating the patient 3.Complying with the standard of care 4.Supervising care 5.Adhering to the nursing process 6.Documenting carefully 7.Following up by evaluating the care that was given In addition, it is a positive practice to develop and maintain a good interpersonal relationship with theclient and his or her family. Some clients appear to be more \"suit prone\" than others. Suit-prone clients are often ver y critical, complaining, uncooperative, and even hostile. A natural response by the staff to theseclients is to become defensive or withdrawn. Either ofthese behaviors increases the likelihood of a lawsuitshould an unfavorable event occur (Ellis & Hartley,2012). No matter how high the degree of technicalcompetence and skill of the nurse, his or her insensi-tivity to a client's complaints and failure to meet theclient's emotional needs often influence whether ornot a lawsuit is generated. A great deal depends on thepsychosocial skills of the health-care professional.CHAPTER 5 Ethical and Legal Issues in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing 91 CLINICAL PEARLS \u0081Always put the client's rights and welfare first. \u0081Develop and maintain a good interpersonal relationship with each client and his or her family. Summary and Key Points Ethics is a branch of philosophy that addresses methods for determining the rightness or wrong-ness of one's actions. Bioethics is the term applied to these principles when they refer to concepts within the scope ofmedicine, nursing, and allied health. Moral behavior is defined as conduct that resultsfrom serious critical thinking about how individu-als ought to treat others.4092_Ch05_078-094 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 91Values are personal beliefs about what is important or desirable. A right is defined as \"a valid, legally recognized claim or entitlement, encompassing both freedom from government interference or discriminatory treat-ment and an entitlement to a benefit or service.\" The ethical theory of utilitarianism is based on the premise that what is right and good is that whichproduces the most happiness for the most people. The ethical theory of Kantianism suggests that ac- tions are bound by a sense of duty, and that ethicaldecisions are made out of respect for moral law. The code of Christian ethics is that all decisions about right and wrong should be centered in lovefor God and in treating others with the same re-spect and dignity with which we would expect to betreated. The moral precept of the natural law theory is \"do good and avoid evil.\" Good is viewed as that whichis inscribed by God into the nature of things. Evilacts are never condoned, even if they are intendedto advance the noblest of ends. Ethical egoism espouses that what is right and good is what is best for the individual making thedecision. Ethical principles include autonomy, beneficence,nonmaleficence, veracity, and justice. An ethical dilemma is a situation that requires an in- dividual to make a choice between two equally un-favorable alternatives.Ethical issues may arise in psychiatric/mentalhealth nursing around the right to refuse medica-tion and the right to the least-restrictive treatmentalternative. Statutory laws are those that have been enacted by legislative bodies, and common laws are derivedfrom decisions made in previous cases. Both typesof laws have civil and criminal components. Civil law protects the private and property rights of individuals and businesses, and criminal law pro- vides protection from conduct deemed injuriousto the public welfare. Legal issues in psychiatric/mental health nursingcenter around confidentiality and the right to pri-vacy, informed consent, restraints and seclusion,and commitment issues. Nurses are accountable for their own actions inrelation to legal issues, and violation can result inmalpractice lawsuits against the physician, thehospital, and the nurse. Developing and maintaining a good interpersonalrelationship with the client and his or her familyappears to be a positive factor when the questionof malpractice is being considered.92 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

How does it differ from ethnicity? Why are these questions important? The answers liein the changing face of America. Immigration is notnew in the United States. Indeed, most U.S. citizensare either immigrants or descendants of immigrantsand the number of foreign-born residents in thiscountry continues to grow on a yearly basis. This pat-tern persists because of the many individuals whowant to take advantage of the technological growthand upward mobility that exists in this country. Abreakdown of cultural groups in the United States ispresented in Figure 6-1. Knowledge related to culture and ethnicity is im- portant because these influences affect human behav-ior, its interpretation, and the response to it.Therefore it is essential for nurses to understand theeffects of these cultural influences if they are to workeffectively with the diverse population. Caution mustbe taken, however, not to assume that all individualswho share a culture or ethnic group are identical orexhibit behaviors perceived as characteristic of thegroup. This constitutes stereotyping and must be avoided. Many variations and subcultures occur withina culture. These differences may be related to status,ethnic background, residence, religion, education, orother factors. Every individual must be appreciated forhis or her uniqueness. This chapter explores the ways in which various cul- tures differ. The nursing process is applied to the deliveryof psychiatric/mental health nursing care for individualsfrom the following cultural groups: Northern EuropeanAmericans, African Americans, Native Americans, Asian/Pacific Islander Americans, Latino Americans, WesternEuropean Americans, Arab Americans, and JewishAmericans. How Do Cultures Differ? It is difficult to generalize about any one specific groupin a country that is known for its heterogeneity. Withinour American \"melting pot\" any or all characteristicscould apply to individuals within any or all of the cul-tural groups represented. As these differences con-tinue to be integrated, one American culture willeventually emerge. This is already evident in certain re-gions of the country today, particularly in the urbancoastal areas. However, some differences still do exist,and it is important for nurses to be aware of certain cul-tural influences that may affect individuals' behaviorsand beliefs, particularly as they apply to health care. Giger (2013) describes six cultural phenomena that vary with application and use yet are evidenced amongall cultural groups: (1) communication, (2) space, (3) social organization, (4) time, (5) environmentalcontrol, and (6) biological variations. Communication All verbal and nonverbal behavior in connectionwith another individual is communication. Thera-peutic communication has always been consideredan essential part of the nursing process and repre-sents a critical element in the curricula of mostschools of nursing. Communication has its roots inculture. Cultural mores, norms, ideas, and customsprovide the basis for our way of thinking. Culturalvalues are learned and differ from society to society.Communication is expressed through language (thespoken and written word), paralanguage (the voicequality, intonation, rhythm, and speed of the spokenword), and gestures (touch, facial expression, eyemovements, body posture, and physical appear-ance). The nurse who is planning care must have anunderstanding of the client's needs and expecta-tions as they are being communicated. As a third96 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing White (57.4%)Hispanic or Latino (16.7%)African American (12.6%)Native American and Alaska Native (0.8%) Other (4.7%)Asian (4.8%)Native Hawaiian andother Pacific Islander(0.2%)Two or more races (2.8%) FIGURE 6-1 Breakdown of cultural groups in the United States. (Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2012.)CORE CONCEPTS Culture describes a particular society's entire way of liv- ing, encompassing shared patterns of belief, feeling, and knowledge that guide people's conduct and arepassed down from generation to generation. Ethnicityis a somewhat narrower term and relates to people whoidentify with each other because of a shared heritage(Griffith, Gonzalez, & Blue, 2003). 4092_Ch06_095-120 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 96party, an interpreter often complicates matters, but one may be necessary when the client does not speakthe same language as the nurse. Interpreting is avery complex process, however, that requires a keensensitivity to cultural nuances, and not just the trans-lating of words into another language. Tips for facil-itating the communication process when using aninterpreter are presented in Box 6-1. Space Spatial determinants relate to the place where thecommunication occurs and encompass the conceptsof territoriality , density , and distance . Territoriality refers to the innate tendency to own space. Theneed for territoriality is met only if the individualhas control of a space, can establish rules for thatspace, and is able to defend the space against inva-sion or misuse by others. Density , which refers to the number of people within a given environmentalspace, can influence interpersonal interaction. Dis-tance is the means by which various cultures use space to communicate. Hall (1966) identified threeprimary dimensions of space in interpersonal inter-actions in the Western culture: the intimate zone (0 to 18 inches), the personal zone (18 inches to 3 feet), and the social zone (3 to 6 feet). Social Organization Cultural behavior is socially acquired through aprocess called enculturation , which involves acquiring knowledge and internalizing values (Giger, 2013).Children are acculturated by observing adults withinCHAPTER 6 Cultural and Spiritual Concepts Relevant to Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing 97 their social organizations. Social organizations in-clude families, religious groups, and ethnic groups. Time An awareness of the concept of time is a graduallearning process. Some cultures place great impor-tance on values that are measured by clock time.Punctuality and efficiency are highly valued in theUnited States, whereas some cultures are actuallyscornful of clock time. For example, some ruralpeople in Algeria label the clock as the \"devil'smill\" and therefore have no notion of scheduledappointment times or meal times (Giger, 2013).They are totally indifferent to the passage of clocktime, and they despise haste in all human endeav-ors. Other cultural implications regarding timehave to do with perception of time orientation.Whether individuals are present oriented or futureoriented in their perception of time influencesmany aspects of their lives. Environmental Control The variable of environmental control has to do withthe degree to which individuals perceive that theyhave control over their environment. Cultural beliefsand practices influence how an individual respondsto his or her environment during periods of wellnessand illness. To provide culturally appropriate care,the nurse should not only respect the individual'sunique beliefs, but should also have an understand-ing of how these beliefs can be used to promote opti-mal health in the client's environment. BOX 6-1 Using an Interpreter When using an interpreter, keep the following points in mind: \u0081Address the client directly rather than speaking to the interpreter. Maintain eye contact with the client to ensure the client' s involvement. \u0081Do not interrupt the client and the interpreter. At times their interaction may take longer because of the need to clarify, and descriptions may require more time because of dialect differences or the interpreter's awareness that the client needsmore preparation before being asked a par ticular question. \u0081Ask the interpreter to g ive you verbatim translations so that you can assess what the client is thinking and understanding. \u0081Avoid using medical jargon that the interpreter or client may not understand. \u0081Avoid talking or commenting to the interpreter at length; the client may feel left out and distrustful. \u0081Be aware that asking intimate or emotionally laden questions may be difficult for both the client and the interpreter. Leadup to these questions slowly . Always ask permission to discuss these topics first, and prepare the interpreter for the content of the interview . \u0081When possible, allow the client and the interpreter to meet each other ahead of time to establish some rapport. If possible,try to use the same interpreter for succeeding interviews with the client. \u0081If possible, request an interpreter of the same gender as the client and of similar age. To make good use of the interpreter'stime, decide beforehand which questions you will ask. Meet with the interpreter briefly before going to see the client sothat you can let the interpreter know what you are planning to ask. During the session, face the client and direct yourquestions to the client, not the interpreter . SOURCE: Gorman, L.M., & Sultan, D.F. (2008).

English is their primary lan-guage. Their language may also include words andphrases that reflect the influence of the languagesspoken in the countries of their heritage. The descen-dants of these immigrants now make up what is con-sidered the dominant cultural group in the UnitedStates today. Specific dialects and rate of speech arecommon to various regions of the country. NorthernEuropean Americans value territory. Personal spacepreference is about 18 inches to 3 feet. With the advent of technology and widespread mobility, less emphasis has been placed on the co-hesiveness of the family. Data on marriage, divorce,Biological Variations Biological differences exist among people in variousracial groups. These differences include body struc-ture (both size and shape), skin color, physiologicalresponses to medication, electrocardiographic pat-terns, susceptibility to disease, and nutritional prefer-ences and deficiencies. Giger (2013) suggests thatnurses who possess factual knowledge about biologi-cal variations among diverse groups are better able toprovide culturally appropriate health care.

Most rec-ognize the importance of regular physical exercise. A typical diet for many Northern European Americans is high in fats and cholesterol and low infiber. Americans, in general, are learning about thehealth benefits of reducing fats and increasing nu-trients in their diet. However, they still enjoy fastfood, which conforms to their fast-paced lifestyles. The United States, viewed as a \"melting pot\" of mul- tiple worldwide ethnic groups, has its own unique cul-ture that impacts the health and care of individuals. It is important that the nurse is self-aware of these conscious/unconscious attitudes and values within theU.S. culture when caring for clients, and also howthese characteristics can impact mental health/illness.Characteristics common to the U.S. culture are pre-sented in Box 6-3.and remarriage in the United States show that abouthalf of first marriages end in divorce (CDC, 2012).The value that was once placed on religion alsoseems to be diminishing in the American culture.With the exception of a few months following theterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when atten-dance increased, there was a steady decline re-ported in church attendance from 1992 to 2008(Gallup, 2008). However, a more recent Gallup pollindicates that there has been a slight rise in churchattendance\u2014up from 42.8 percent in 2009 to 43.1percent in 2010 (Gallup, 2012). Punctuality and ef-ficiency are highly valued in the culture that pro-moted the work ethic, and most within this culturalgroup tend to be future oriented (Murray, Zentner,& Yakimo, 2009). Northern European Americans, particularly those who achieve middle-class socioeconomic status, valuepreventive medicine and primary health care.

Individuality \u2014Independent, ambitious, self-reliant, control over one's life, desire for individual choices result in long-term debates concerning government control of health care, school choice, possession of personal firearms, etc. 2. Perfectionism\u2014Strong emphasis on achievement in school, jobs, sports, and physical beauty. 3. Direct Communication\u2014Display of emotions is proper, within limits. Constructive criticism is considered helpful for others.Vast public use of social media provides instant connections that can strengthen or hinder relationships. 4. Time Adherence \u2014Punctuality is important, activities organized around specific schedules, hurried, active lifestyles causing difficulty with relaxation, stress tolerance, and physical fitness. 5. Informality/Friendliness\u2014Common use of first name when addressing others. Many friendly expressions such as \"let'sget together soon\" and \"drop by anytime\" are sincere at the time, but because of busy lifestyles are not meant literally. 6. Consumerism\u2014Mass luxuries, growth of comfort pleasures, need for material goods, standardized \"high end\" designerproducts\u2014homes, clothing, automobiles are desired in all income levels; long distance travel vacations, vast accumulationof goods leading to economic stress and excessive debt; overconsumption in food practices resulting in increased obesityand decreased overall health. 7. Social Challenges\u2014Suburban tract housing, widespread drive-through dining, frequent relocations, solo car travel, de-creased family and community connections, mall shopping vs. local shopping; increase in bullying behaviors inschool/workplace and proliferation of violence and traumatic events within the family and community.

Personal space tends to be smaller than that ofthe dominant culture. Patterns of discrimination date back to the days of slavery, and evidence of segregation still exists, usuallyin the form of predominantly black neighborhoods,churches, and schools, which are still visible in someU.S. cities. Some African Americans find it difficult toassimilate into the mainstream culture and choose toremain within their own social organization. The most recent survey by the U.S. Census Bureau revealed that 47 percent of African American familyhouseholds were headed by a woman (U.S. CensusBureau, 2012). Social support systems may be largeand include sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, cousins,boyfriends, girlfriends, neighbors, and friends. ManyAfrican Americans have a strong religious orienta-tion, with the vast majority practicing some form ofProtestantism (Pew Forum on Religion and PublicLife, 2009). African Americans who have assimilated into the dominant culture are likely to be well educated, pro-fessional, and future oriented. Some who have not be-come assimilated may believe that planning for thefuture is hopeless, a belief based on their previous ex-periences and encounters with racism and discrimina-tion (Cherry & Giger, 2013). Among this group, somemay be unemployed or have low-paying jobs, with littleexpectation for improvement. They are unlikely tovalue time or punctuality to the same degree as thedominant cultural group, which may result in theirbeing labeled as irresponsible. Some African Americans, particularly those from the rural South, may reach adulthood never havingencountered a physician. They may receive their med-ical care from the local folk practitioner known as\"granny\" or \"the old lady,\" or a \"spiritualist.\" Incorpo-rated into the system of folk medicine is the belief that health is a gift from God, whereas illness is a pun-ishment from God or a retribution for sin and evil.Historically, African Americans have turned to folkmedicine either because they could not afford thecost of mainstream medical treatment or because ofthe insensitive treatment by caregivers in the health-care delivery system. Hypertension occurs more frequently, and sickle cell disease occurs predominantly, in African Americans.Hypertension carries a strong hereditary risk factor,whereas sickle cell disease is genetically derived. Al-coholism is a serious problem among members ofthe black community, leading to a high incidenceof alcohol-related illness and death (Cherry &Giger, 2013). The diet of most African Americans differs little from that of the mainstream culture. However, someAfrican Americans follow their heritage and still enjoywhat has come to be known as \"soul\" food, which in-cludes items such as poke salad, collard greens, beans,corn, fried chicken, black-eyed peas, grits, okra, andcornbread. These foods are now considered typicalSouthern fare and are regularly consumed and en-joyed by most individuals who inhabit the southernregion of the United States. Native Americans The federal government currently recognizes 566American Indian tribes and Alaska Native groups. Ap-proximately 200 tribal languages are still spoken,some by only a few individuals and others by many(Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA], 2012). Fewer thanhalf of these individuals still live on reservations, butmany return regularly to participate in family andtribal life and sometimes to retire. Touch is an aspect of communication that is not the same among Native Americans as in the dominantAmerican culture. Some Native Americans view thetraditional handshake as somewhat aggressive. In-stead, if a hand is offered to another, it may be ac-cepted with a light touch or just a passing of hands.Some Native Americans will not touch a dead person(Hanley, 2013). Native Americans may appear silent and reserved. They may be uncomfortable expressing emotions be-cause the culture encourages keeping private thoughtsto oneself. Eye contact is avoided and considered rude(Purnell, 2009). The concept of space is very concrete to Native Americans. Living space is often crowded with mem-bers of both nuclear and extended families. A largenetwork of kin is very important to Native Americans.However, a need for extended space exists, as demon-strated by a distance of many miles between individualhomes or camps. The primary social organizations of Native Ameri- cans are the family and the tribe. From infancy, NativeAmerican children are taught the importance ofthese units. Traditions are passed down by the elderly,and children are taught to respect tradition and tohonor wisdom. Most Native Americans are very present-time ori- ented. The concept of time is very casual, and tasksare accomplished, not with the notion of a particulartime in mind, but merely in a present-oriented time100 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing4092_Ch06_095-120 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 100frame. Not only are Native Americans not ruled by the clock, some do not even own clocks. Religion and health practices are intertwined in the Native American culture. The medicine man (orwoman) is called the shaman and may use a variety of methods in his or her practice. Some use crystals todiagnose illness, some sing and perform healing cer-emonies, and some use herbs and other plants orroots to create remedies with healing properties. TheNative American healers and U.S. Indian Health Serv-ice have worked together with mutual respect formany years. Hanley (2013) relates that a Native Amer-ican healer may confer with a physician regarding thecare of a client in the hospital. Research studies havecontinued to show the importance of each of thesehealth-care approaches in the overall wellness of Na-tive American people. The risks of illness and premature death from al- coholism, diabetes, tuberculosis, heart disease, acci-dents, homicide, suicide, pneumonia, and influenzaare dramatically higher for Native Americans than forthe U.S. population as a whole. The risks of illnessand premature death from alcoholism alone are re-ported as 552 percent higher (Indian Health Service[IHS], 2013). Alcoholism is not only a significantproblem among Native Americans but it may also berelated to a number of other serious problems suchas depression, automobile accidents, homicides,spouse and child abuse, and suicides. Nutritional deficiencies are not uncommon among tribal Native Americans. Fruits and green vegetablesare often scarce in many of the federally defined In-dian geographical regions. Meat and corn productsare identified as preferred foods. Fiber intake is rela-tively low, while fat intake is often of the saturated va-riety. A large number of Native Americans living onor near reservations recognized by the federal or stategovernment receive commodity foods supplied bythe U.S. Department of Agriculture's food distribu-tion program (U.S. Department of Agriculture,2012). Asian/Pacific Islander Americans Asian Americans comprise 4.8 percent of the U.S. pop-ulation. The Asian American culture includes peoples(and their descendants) from Japan, China, Vietnam,the Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, Korea, Laos,India, and the Pacific Islands. Although this discussionrelates to these peoples as a single culture, it is impor-tant to keep in mind that a multiplicity of differencesregarding attitudes, beliefs, values, religious practices,and language exist among these subcultures. Many Asian Americans, particularly Japanese, are third- and even fourth-generation Americans. Theseindividuals are likely to be acculturated to the U.S.culture. Kuo and Roysircar-Sodowsky (2000) describethree patterns common to Asian Americans in theirattempt to adjust to the American culture: 1. The traditionalists: These individuals tend to be the older generation Asians who hold on to thetraditional values and practices of their native cul-ture. They have strong internalized Asian values.Primary allegiance is to the biological family . 2. The marginal people: These individuals reject the traditional values and totally embrace Western culture. Often they are members of the youngergenerations. 3. Asian Americans: These individuals incorporate tra- ditional values and beliefs with Western values and beliefs. They become integrated into the Americanculture, while maintaining a connection with theirancestral culture. The languages and dialects of Asian Americans are ver y diverse. In general, they do share a similar belief in harmonious interaction. To raise one's voice is likelyto be interpreted as a sign of loss of control. The English language is very difficult to master, and evenbilingual Asian Americans may encounter communi-cation problems because of the differences in mean-ing assigned to nonverbal cues, such as facial gestures,verbal intonation and speed, and body movements. InAsian cultures, touching during communication hashistorically been considered unacceptable. However,with the advent of Western acculturation, youngergenerations of Asian Americans accept touching asmore appropriate than did their ancestors. Eye con-tact is often avoided as it connotes rudeness and lackof respect in some Asian cultures. Acceptable personaland social spaces are larger than in the dominantAmerican culture. Some Asian Americans have a greatdeal of difficulty expressing emotions. Because of theirreserved public demeanor, Asian Americans may beperceived as shy, cold, or uninterested. The family is the ultimate social organization in traditional Asian American culture, and loyalty tofamily is emphasized above all else. Children are ex-pected to obey and honor their parents. Misbehavioris perceived as bringing dishonor to the entire family.Filial piety (one's social obligation or duty to one'sparents) is held in high regard. Failure to fulfill theseobligations can create a great deal of guilt and shamein an individual. A chronological hierarchy exists withthe elderly maintaining positions of authority. Severalgenerations, or even extended families, may share asingle household. Although education is highly valued among Asian Americans, many remain undereducated. Religiousbeliefs and practices are diverse and exhibit influ-ences of Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Islam,Hinduism, and Christianity.CHAPTER 6 Cultural and Spiritual Concepts Relevant to Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing 1014092_Ch06_095-120 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 101Many Asian Americans value both a past and a present orientation. Emphasis is placed on the wishes of one's ancestors, while adjusting to demands of thepresent. Little value is given to prompt adherence toschedules or rigid standards of activities. Restoring the balance of yin and yang is the funda- mental concept of Asian health practices. Yin andyang represent opposite forces of energy, such as negative/positive, dark/light, cold/hot, hard/soft,and feminine/masculine. The belief is that illness oc-curs when there is a disruption in the balance of theseenergy forces. In medicine, the opposites are ex-pressed as \"hot\" and \"cold,\" and health is the resultof a balance between hot and cold elements (Xu &Chang, 2013). Food, medicines, and herbs are classi-fied according to their hot and cold properties andare used to restore balance between yin and yang(cold and hot), thereby restoring health. Rice, vegetables, and fish are the main staple foods of Asian Americans. Milk is seldom consumed be-cause a large majority of Asian Americans experiencelactose intolerance. With Western acculturation, theirdiet is changing, and unfortunately, with more meatbeing consumed, the percentage of fat in the diet isincreasing. Many Asian Americans believe that psychiatric ill- ness is merely behavior that is out of control. Theyview this as a great shame to the individual and thefamily. They often attempt to manage the ill personon their own until they can no longer handle the sit-uation. It is not uncommon for Asian Americans tosomaticize. Expressing mental distress through vari-ous physical ailments may be viewed as more accept-able than expressing true emotions. The incidence of alcohol dependence is low among Asians. This may be a result of a possible ge-netic intolerance of the substance. Some Asians de-velop unpleasant symptoms, such as flushing,headaches, and palpitations, on drinking alcohol. Re-search indicates that this is due to an isoenzyme vari-ant that quickly converts alcohol to acetaldehyde andthe absence of an isoenzyme that is needed to oxidizeacetaldehyde. This results in a rapid accumulation ofacetaldehyde that produces the unpleasant symptoms(Wall et al., 1997). Latino Americans Latino Americans are the fastest growing group ofpeople in the United States, comprising 16.7 percentof the population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). Theyrepresent the largest ethnic minority group. Latino Americans trace their ancestry to countries such as Mexico, Spain, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and othercountries of Central and South America. The com-mon language is Spanish, spoken with a number ofdialects by the various peoples. Touch is a commonform of communication among Latinos; however,they are very modest and are likely to withdraw fromany infringement on their modesty. Traditional Latino Americans are very group oriented and often interact with large groups of rela-tives. Touching and embracing are common modesof communication. The family is the primary socialorganization and includes nuclear family members aswell as numerous extended family members. The tra-ditional nuclear family is male dominated, and the fa-ther possesses ultimate authority. Latino Americans tend to be focused on the present time. The concept of being punctual and giving atten-tion to activities that concern the future are perceivedas less important than activities in the present time. Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion among Latino Americans. Most Latinos identify withthe Roman Catholic Church, even if they do not at-tend services. Religious beliefs and practices are likelyto be strong influences in their lives. Especially intimes of crisis, such as in cases of illness and hospital-ization, Latino Americans rely on priests and the fam-ily to carry out important religious rituals, such aspromise making, offering candles, visiting shrines,and offering prayers (Spector, 2013). Folk beliefs regarding health are a combination of elements incorporating views of Roman Catholicismand Indian and Spanish beliefs. The folk healer is calleda curandero (male) or curandera (female). Among tra- ditional Latino Americans, the curandero is believed to have a gift from God for healing the sick and is oftenthe first contact made when illness is encountered.Treatments used include massage, diet, rest, sugges-tions, practical advice, indigenous herbs, prayers,magic, and supernatural rituals (Owen, Gonzalez, & Espereat, 2013). Many Latino Americans still subscribeto the \"hot and cold theory\" of disease. This concept issimilar to the Asian perception of yin and yang dis-cussed earlier in this chapter. Diseases and the foodsand medicines used to treat them are classified as \"hot\"or \"cold,\" and the intention is to restore the body to abalanced state. One national study revealed that the lifetime prevalence for selected psychiatric disorders is 36.8percent for U.S.-born Latinos, which is higher thanthe prevalence for Latinos in the United States whoare immigrants from other countries (Alegria et al.,2007). The authors theorized that this may be relatedto stress experienced as they attempt to assimilate tothe economic and cultural ideals in the United Stateswhile still maintaining minority group status. Theyalso noted that the Puerto Rican subgroup manifestsa higher incidence of depression, substance abuse,and anxiety disorders (particularly post-traumatic102 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing4092_Ch06_095-120 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 102stress disorder) when compared to Cuban, Mexican, or other Latino groups. These prevalence rates mayeven be conservative, because \"certain symptoms ofpsychiatric disorders among immigrant populations(e.g., ataque de nervios) would not be represented in the diagnostic batteries used with the general popu-lation\" (Kaplan, 2007, p. 2). As this cultural group,and particularly U.S.-born Latino Americans, contin-ues to grow in number, mental health professionalswill need to develop awareness of this increased riskfor illness and sensitivity to the cultural values thatmay impact seeking treatment. Western European Americans Western European Americans have their origin inFrance, Italy, and Greece. Each of these cultures pos-sesses its own language, in which a number of dialectsare noticeable. Western Europeans are considered tobe very warm and affectionate people. They tend tobe physically expressive, using a lot of body language,including hugging and kissing. Like Latino Americans, Western European Americans are very family oriented. They interact in large groups,and it is not uncommon for several generations to livetogether or in close proximity. A strong allegiance tothe cultural heritage exists, and it is not uncommon,particularly among Italians, to find settlements of im-migrants clustering together. Roles within the family are clearly defined, with the man as the head of the household. TraditionalWestern European women view their role as motherand homemaker, and children are prized and cher-ished. The elderly are held in positions of respect andoften are cared for in the home rather than placed innursing homes. Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion for French and Italian people, Greek Orthodox for theGreek community. A number of religious traditionsare observed surrounding rites of passage. Masses andrituals are observed for births, first communions, mar-riages, anniversaries, and deaths. Western Europeans tend to be present-time ori- ented, with a somewhat fatalistic view of the future. Apriority is placed on the here and now, and whateverhappens in the future is perceived as God's will. Most Western European Americans follow health be- liefs and practices of the dominant American culture,but some folk beliefs and superstitions still endure.Spector (2013) reports the following superstitions andpractices of Italians as they relate to health and illness: 1. Congenital abnormalities can be attributed to theunsatisfied desire for food during pregnancy. 2. If a woman is not given food that she craves orsmells, the fetus will move inside, and a miscar-riage can result.3. If a pregnant woman bends or turns or moves in acertain way, the fetus may not develop normally . 4. A woman must not reach during pregnancy be-cause reaching can harm the fetus. 5. Sitting in a draft can cause a cold that can lead topneumonia. Food is very important in the Western European American culture. Italian, Greek, and French cuisineis world famous, and food is used in a social manner,as well as for nutritional purposes. Wine is consumedby all (even the children, who are given a mixture ofwater and wine) and is the beverage of choice withmeals. However, among Greek Americans, drunken-ness engenders social disgrace on the individual andthe family (Purnell, 2009). Arab Americans* Arab Americans trace their ancestry and traditions tothe nomadic desert tribes of the Arabian Peninsula.The Arab countries include Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros,Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya,Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, SaudiArabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United ArabEmirates, and Yemen. First-wave immigrants, primarily Christians, came to the United States between 1887 and 1913 seekingeconomic opportunity. First-wave immigrants andtheir descendants typically resided in urban centers ofthe Northeast. Second-wave immigrants entered theUnited States after World War II. Most are refugeesfrom nations beset by war and political instability. Thisgroup includes a large number of professionals andindividuals seeking educational degrees who have sub-sequently remained in the United States. Most areMuslims and favor professional occupations. Arabic is the official language of the Arab world. Although English is a common second language, lan-guage and communication can pose formidable prob-lems in health-care settings. Communication is highlycontextual, where unspoken expectations are moreimportant than the actual spoken words. While con-versing, individuals stand close together, maintainsteady eye contact, and touch (only between membersof the same gender) the other's hand or shoulder. Speech may be loud and expressive and character- ized by repetition and gesturing, particularly wheninvolved in serious discussions. Observers witnessingimpassioned communication may incorrectly assumethat members of this culture are argumentative, con-frontational, or aggressive. Privacy is valued, andCHAPTER 6 Cultural and Spiritual Concepts Relevant to Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing 103 *This section on Arab Americans is adapted from Kulwicki, A.D., & Ballout, S. (2013). People of Arab heritage. In L.D. Purnell (Ed.), Transcultural health care: A culturally competent approach ed.). \u00a9 F.A. Davis.

Among friends and relatives, Arabs ex-press feelings freely. Devout Muslim men may notshake hands with women. When an Arab man is in-troduced to an Arab woman, the man waits for thewoman to extend her hand. Punctuality is not taken seriously except in cases of business or professional meetings. Social events and ap-pointments tend not to have a fixed beginning or end. Gender roles are clearly defined. The man is the head of the household and women are subordinate tomen. Men are breadwinners, protectors, and decisionmakers. Women are responsible for the care and edu-cation of children and for the maintenance of a suc-cessful marriage by tending to their husbands' needs. The family is the primary social organization, and children are loved and indulged. The father is the dis-ciplinarian and the mother is an ally and mediator.Loyalty to one's family takes precedence over per-sonal needs. Sons are responsible for supporting eld-erly parents. Women value modesty, especially devout Muslims, for whom modesty is expressed with their attire. ManyMuslim women view the practice of hijab, covering the body except for one's face and hands, as offering themprotection in situations in which the genders mix. Sickle cell disease and the thalassemias are common in the eastern Mediterranean. Sedentary lifestyle andhigh fat intake among Arab Americans place them athigher risk for cardiovascular diseases. The rates of cho-lesterol testing, colorectal cancer screening, and uter-ine cancer screening are low; however, in recent years,the rate of mammography screening has increased. Arab cooking shares many general characteristics. Spices and herbs include cinnamon, allspice, cloves,ginger, cumin, mint, parsley, bay leaves, garlic, andonions. Bread accompanies every meal and is viewedas a gift from God. Lamb and chicken are the mostpopular meats. Muslims are prohibited from eatingpork and pork products. Food is eaten with the righthand because it is regarded as clean. Eating and drink-ing at the same time is viewed as unhealthy. Eatingproperly, consuming nutritious foods, and fasting arebelieved to cure disease. Gastrointestinal complaintsare the most frequent reason for seeking health care.Lactose intolerance is common. Most Arabs are Muslims. Islam is the religion of most Arab countries, and in Islam there is no separation ofchurch and state; a certain amount of religious partici-pation is obligatory. Many Muslims believe in combin-ing spiritual medicine, performing daily prayers, andreading or listening to the Qur'an with conventionalmedical treatment. The devout client may request thathis or her chair or bed be turned to face Mecca and thata basin of water be provided for ritual washing or ablu-tion before praying. Sometimes illness is consideredpunishment for one's sins. Mental illness is a major social stigma. Psychiatric symptoms may be denied or attributed to \"badnerves\" or evil spirits. When individuals sufferingfrom mental distress seek medical care, they are likelyto present with a variety of vague complaints such asabdominal pain, lassitude, anorexia, and shortness ofbreath. Clients often expect and may insist on somatictreatment, at least vitamins and tonics. When mentalillness is accepted as a diagnosis, treatment with med-ications, rather than counseling, is preferred. Jewish Americans To be Jewish is to belong to a specific group of peopleand a specific religion. The term Jewish does not refer to a race. The Jewish people came to the UnitedStates mostly from Spain, Portugal, Germany, and Eastern Europe (Schwartz, 2013). There are more than 5 million Jewish Americans living in the United States,and they live primarily in the larger urban areas. Four main Jewish religious groups exist today: Orthodox, Reform, Conservative, and Reconstruc-tionist. Orthodox Jews adhere to strict interpretationand application of Jewish laws and ethics. They be-lieve that the laws outlined in the Torah (the fivebooks of Moses) are divine, eternal, and unalterable.Reform Judaism is the largest Jewish religious groupin the United States. The Reform group believes inthe autonomy of the individual in interpreting theJewish code of law, and a more liberal interpretationis followed. Conservative Jews also accept a less strictinterpretation. They believe that the code of lawscomes from God, but accept flexibility and adaptationof those laws to absorb aspects of the culture while re-maining true to Judaism's values. The Reconstruction-ists have modern views that generally overridetraditional Jewish laws. They do not believe that Jewsare God's chosen people and they reject the notionof divine intervention. Reconstructionists are gener-ally accepting of interfaith marriage. The primary language of Jewish Americans is English. Hebrew, the official language of Israel andthe Torah, is used for prayers and is taught in Jewishreligious education. Early Jewish immigrants spoke aJudeo-German dialect called Yiddish, and some ofthose words have become part of American English(e.g., klutz, kosher, tush, chutzpah, mazel tov ). Although traditional Jewish law is clearly male ori- ented, with acculturation little difference is seentoday with regard to gender roles. Formal educationis a highly respected value among the Jewish people.More than half of all Jewish adults have received a college degree, and a quarter have earned a graduate104 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing4092_Ch06_095-120 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 104degree (Chiswick, 2009). Jewish people hold a propor- tionately higher percentage of professional and executivepositions when compared to the total U.S. population(United Jewish Communities, 2003). While most Jewish people live for today and plan for and worry about tomorrow, they are raised with storiesof their past, especially of the Holocaust. They arewarned to \"never forget,\" lest history be repeated.Therefore, their time orientation is simultaneously tothe past, the present, and the future (Selekman, 2013). Children are considered blessings and valued treasures, treated with respect, and deeply loved.They play an active role in most holiday celebrationsand services. Respecting and honoring one's parentsis one of the Ten Commandments. Children are ex-pected to be forever grateful to their parents for giv-ing them the gift of life (Selekman, 2013). The rite ofpassage into adulthood occurs during a religious cer-emony called a bar or bat mitzvah (son or daughter of the commandment) and is usually commemorated bya family celebration. Because of the respect afforded physicians and the emphasis on keeping the body and mind healthy, Jewish Americans tend to be health conscious. In gen-eral, they practice preventive health care, with routinephysical, dental, and vision screening. Circumcisionfor male infants is both a medical procedure and a re-ligious rite and is performed on the eighth day of life.The procedure is usually performed at home and isconsidered a family festivity. A number of genetic diseases are more common in the Jewish population, including Tay-Sachs disease,Gaucher's disease, and familial dysautonomia. Otherconditions that occur with increased incidence in theJewish population include inflammatory bowel disease(ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), colorectal can-cer, and breast and ovarian cancer. Jewish people havea higher rate of side effects from the antipsychoticclozapine. About 20 percent develop agranulocytosis,the cause of which has been attributed to a specific ge-netic haplotype (Selekman, 2013). Alcohol, especially wine, is an essential part of reli- gious holidays and festive occasions. It is viewed as appro-priate and acceptable as long as it is used in moderation.For Jewish people who follow the dietary laws, a tremen-dous amount of attention is given to the slaughter of live-stock and the preparation and consumption of food.Religious laws dictate which foods are permissible. Theterm kosher means \"fit to eat,\" and following these guide- lines is considered a commandment of God. Meat maybe eaten only if the permitted animal has been slaugh-tered, cooked, or served following kosher guidelines. Pigsare considered unclean, and pork and pork products areforbidden. Dairy products and meat may not be mixedtogether in cooking, serving, or eating.Judaism opposes discrimination against people with physical, mental, and developmental conditions.The maintenance of one's mental health is consid-ered just as important as the maintenance of one'sphysical health. Mental incapacity has always beenrecognized as grounds for exemption from all obliga-tions under Jewish law (Selekman, 2013). A summary of information related to the six cul- tural phenomena as they apply to the cultural groupsdiscussed here is presented in Table 6-1. Culture-Bound Syndromes Culture-bound syndromes are \"unique patterns of aberrant behavior and troubling experiences, [thatoccur] in various parts of the world, whose clinical de-scriptions do not readily fit into the Western conven-tional diagnostic categories\" (Gaw, 2008, p. 1537). Itis important for nurses to understand that individualsfrom diverse cultural groups may exhibit these physi-cal and behavioral manifestations. The syndromes areviewed within these cultural groups as folk, diagnosticcategories with specific sets of experiences and obser-vations. Examples of culture-bound syndromes arepresented in Table 6-2. Diagnosis/Outcome Identification Nursing diagnoses are selected based on the informa-tion gathered during the assessment process. Withbackground knowledge of cultural variables and in-formation uniquely related to the individual, the fol-lowing nursing diagnoses may be appropriate: Impaired verbal communication related to culturaldifferences evidenced by inability to speak thedominant language Anxiety (moderate to severe) related to entry intoan unfamiliar health-care system and separationfrom support systems evidenced by apprehensionand suspicion, restlessness, and trembling Imbalanced nutrition, less than body require-ments, related to refusal to eat unfamiliar foodsprovided in the health-care setting, evidenced byloss of weight Spiritual distress related to inability to participate inusual religious practices because of hospitalization,evidenced by alterations in mood (e.g., anger, crying,withdrawal, preoccupation, anxiety, hostility, apathy) Outcome criteria related to these nursing diag- noses may include the following: The client has: 1. Had all basic needs fulfilled. 2. Communicated with staff through an interpreter. 3. Maintained anxiety at a manageable level by hav-ing family members stay with him or her duringhospitalization.CHAPTER 6 Cultural and Spiritual Concepts Relevant to Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing

KoreaSouthern and Eastern AsiaEskimo cultures Latin America JapanViolent or homicidal behavior preceded by a state of brooding and ending with a period of somnolence and amnesia. Uncontrollable shouting, crying, trembling, verbal or physical aggression, sometimes accompanied bydissociative experiences, seizure-like or faintingepisodes, and suicidal gestures. Difficulty concentrating; poor memory retention; pain and pressure around head and neck; blurred vision.Students often complain of \"brain fatigue.\" Preoccupation with death and the deceased. Symp- toms include anxiety, confusion, weakness, feelingsof danger, anorexia, and bad dreams. Sometimes associated with witchcraft. Attributed to the suppression of anger. Symptoms closely related to those of depression, including insomnia, fatigue, indigestion, dysphoria, anorexia,bodily aches, and loss of interest. Intense anxiety associated with the fear that the penis (in males) or the vulva and nipples (in females) will retract into the body and cause theperson to die. Sometimes called arctic hysteria. An abrupt episode of extreme excitement, preceded by withdrawal or mildirritability, and followed by seizure activity and coma.During the attack the individual engages in aberrantand bizarre verbal and motor behavior. Afterward,usually reports complete amnesia for the attack. Symptoms include appetite and sleep disturbances, sadness, pains, headache, stomachache, and diarrhea. The soul is thought to leave the body(during dreams or following a traumatic event), resulting in unhappiness and illness. Intense anxiety and fear about possibly offending others, particularly with their body functions, appearance, or odor. 4. Maintained weight by eating foods that he or she likes brought to the hospital by family members. 5. Restored spiritual strength through use of culturalrituals and beliefs and visits from a spiritual leader. Planning/Implementation The following interventions have special cultural im-plications for nursing: 1. Use an interpreter if necessary to ensure thatthere are no barriers to communication. Be care-ful with nonverbal communication because it maybe interpreted differently by different cultures(e.g., Asians and Native Americans may be un-comfortable with touch and direct eye contact,whereas Latinos and Western Europeans perceivetouch as a sign of caring). 2. Make allowances for individuals from other cul-tures to have family members around them andeven participate in their care. Large numbers of extended family members are ver y important to African Americans, Native Americans, AsianAmericans, Latino Americans, and Western Euro-pean Americans. To deny access to these family sup-port systems could interfere with the healing process. 3. Ensure that the individual's spiritual needs arebeing met. Religion is an important source of sup-port for many individuals, and the nurse must betolerant of various rituals that may be connected4092_Ch06_095-120 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 108CHAPTER 6 Cultural and Spiritual Concepts Relevant to Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing 109 with different cultural beliefs about health and illness. 4. Be aware of the differences in concept of timeamong the various cultures. Most members of thedominant American culture are future oriented andplace a high value on punctuality and efficiency.Other cultures such as African Americans, NativeAmericans, Asian Americans, Latino Americans,Arab Americans and W estern European Americans are more present-time oriented. Nurses must beaware that such individuals may not share the valueof punctuality. They may be late to appointmentsand appear to be indifferent to some aspects of theirtherapy. Nurses must be accepting of these differ-ences and refrain from allowing existing attitudes tointerfere with delivery of care. 5. Be aware of different beliefs about health careamong the various cultures, and recognize the im-portance of these beliefs to the healing process. Ifan individual from another culture has been receiv-ing health care from a spiritualist, granny, curan-dero, or other nontraditional healer , it is important for the nurse to listen to what has been done in thepast and even to consult with these cultural healersabout the care being given to the client. 6. Follow the health-care practices that the clientviews as essential, provided they do no harm or donot interfere with the healing process of the client. For example, the concepts of yin and yang and the \"hot and cold\" theor y of disease are very important to the well-being of some Asians and Latinos, re-spectively. Try to ensure that a balance of thesefoods is included in the diet as an important rein-forcement for traditional medical care. 7. Be aware of favorite foods of individuals from dif-ferent cultures. The health-care setting may seemstrange and somewhat isolated, and for some indi-viduals it feels good to have anything around themthat is familiar. They may even refuse to eat foodsthat are unfamiliar to them. If it does not inter fere with his or her care, allow family members to pro-vide favorite foods for the client. 8. The nurse working in psychiatry must realize thatpsychiatric illness is stigmatized in some cultures.Individuals who believe that expressing emotionsis unacceptable (e.g., Asian Americans and NativeAmericans) will present unique problems whenthey are clients in a psychiatric setting. Nursesmust have patience and work slowly to establishtrust in order to provide these individuals with theassistance they require. Evaluation Evaluation of nursing actions is directed at achievementof the established outcomes. Part of the evaluationprocess is continuous reassessment to ensure that theselected actions are appropriate and the goals and out-comes are realistic. Including the family and extendedsupport systems in the evaluation process is essential ifcultural implications of nursing care are to be meas-ured. Modifications to the plan of care are made as theneed is determined. Spiritual Concepts Spirituality is difficult to describe. Historically, it hashad distinctly religious connections, with a spiritualperson being described as \"someone with whom theSpirit of God dwelt.\" More recently, however, it hasbeen considered \"something people define for them-selves that is largely free of the rules, regulations andresponsibilities associated with religion\" (Koenig,2009, p. 284). In the treatment of mental illness, some of the ear- liest practices focused on including spiritual treat-ment, because insanity was considered a disruptionof mind and spirit (Reeves & Reynolds, 2009). How-ever, Freud (often described as a forefather of psy-chiatric treatment) believed that religion had anegative effect on mental health, and that it waslinked to a host of psychiatric symptoms. Thus reli-gion and spiritually have been avoided rather thanembraced as a valuable aspect of treatment. More re-cently, the focus is changing once again. Reeves andReynolds (2009) note that the large volume of con-temporary research (more than 60 studies) demon-strating the value of spirituality for both medical andpsychiatric patients is influencing this change. Nurs-ing has embraced this new focus by the inclusion ofnursing responsibility for spiritual care in the Inter-national Council of Nurses Code of Ethics and in the American Holistic Nurses Association Standards for Holistic Nursing Practice. The inclusion of spiritualcare is also evidenced by the development of thenursing diagnosis category \"Spiritual Distress\" byNANDA International (Wright, 2005). Smucker (2001) stated: Spirituality is the recognition or experience of a di- mension of life that is invisible, and both within usand yet beyond our material world, providing aCORE CONCEPT Spirituality The human quality that gives meaning and sense ofpurpose to an individual's existence. Spirituality existswithin each individual regardless of belief system andserves as a force for interconnectedness between theself and others, the environment, and a higher power. 4092_Ch06_095-120 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 109sense of connectedness and interrelatedness with the universe. (p. 5) Smucker (2001) identified the following factors as types of spiritual needs associated with human beings: 1. Meaning and purpose in life 2. Faith or trust in someone or something beyond ourselves 3. Hope 4. Love 5. Forgiveness Spiritual Needs Meaning and Purpose in Life Humans by nature appreciate order and structure intheir lives. Having a purpose in life gives one a senseof control and the feeling that life is worth living. In-deed, Burkhardt and Nagai-Jacobson (2002) describethe essence of spirituality as the developing awarenessof who we are, what is our purpose in being, and theunderstanding of our connectedness with ourselves aswell as beyond ourselves. Each nurse's exploration ofhis or her own spirituality and efforts to grow spirituallyare foundational to being responsive to those needs inothers. Walsh (1999) describes \"seven perennial prac-tices\" that he believes promote enlightenment, aid intransformation, and encourage spiritual growth. Heidentified the seven perennial practices as follows: 1. Transform your motivation: Reduce craving and find your soul's desire. 2. Cultivate emotional wisdom: Heal your heart and learn to love. 3. Live ethically: Feel good by doing good. 4. Concentrate and calm your mind: Accept the chal- lenge of mastering attention and mindfulness. 5. Awaken your spiritual vision: See clearly and rec- ognize the sacred in all things. 6. Cultivate spiritual intelligence: Develop wisdom and understand life. 7. Express spirit in action: Embrace generosity and the joy of service. (p. 14) In the final analysis, each individual must deter - mine his or her own perception of what is importantand what gives meaning to life. Throughout one's ex-istence, the meaning of life will undoubtedly be chal-lenged many times. A solid spiritual foundation mayhelp an individual confront the challenges that resultfrom life's experiences. Faith Faith is often thought of as the acceptance of a beliefin the absence of physical or empirical evidence.Smucker (2001) stated: For all people, faith is an important concept. From childhood on, our psychological health depends onhaving faith or trust in something or someone to helpmeet our needs. (p. 7) Having faith requires that individuals rise above that which they can only experience through the five senses. Indeed, faith transcends the appearance ofthe physical world. An increasing amount of medicaland scientific research is showing that what individ-uals believe exists can have as powerful an impactas what actually exists. Karren, Hafen, Smith, andJenkins (2010) stated: [There is a] growing appreciation of the healing power of faith among members of the medical com-munity. Belief strongly impacts health outcomes, andbelief of a large majority of Americans is connectedto their religious commitments. Seventy-five percentof Americans say that their religious faith forms thefoundation for their approach to life. Seventy-threepercent of Americans say that prayer is an importantpart of their daily life. Religious belief provides powerfor an individual. With such beliefs so prevalent, it isno surprise that religious faith plays a significant rolein healing. (p. 360) Evidence suggests that faith, combined with con- ventional treatment and an optimistic attitude, can be a very powerful element in the healing process. Hope Hope has been defined as a special kind of positive ex- pectation (Karren et al., 2010). With hope, individu-als look at a situation, and no matter how negative,find something positive on which to focus. Hopefunctions as an energizing force. In addition, researchindicates that hope may promote healing, facilitatecoping, and enhance quality of life (Nekolaichuk,Jevne, & Maguire, 1999). K\u00fcbler-Ross (1969), in her classic study of dying pa- tients, stressed the importance of hope. She suggestedthat, even though these patients could not hope fora cure, they could hope for additional time to live, tobe with loved ones, for freedom from pain, or for apeaceful death with dignity. She found hope to be asatisfaction unto itself, whether or not it was fulfilled.She stated, \"If a patient stops expressing hope, it isusually a sign of imminent death\" (p. 140). Researchers in the field of psychoneuroim- munology have found that the attitudes we haveand the emotions we experience have a definite ef-fect on the body. An optimistic feeling of hope isnot just a mental state. Hope and optimism pro-duce positive physical changes in the body that caninfluence the immune system and the functioningof specific body organs. The medical literatureabounds with countless examples of individualswith terminal conditions who suddenly improvewhen they find something to live for. Conversely,110 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing4092_Ch06_095-120 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 110there are also many accounts of patients whose con- ditions deteriorate when they lose hope. Love Love may be identified as a projection of one's owngood feelings onto others. To love others, one mustfirst experience love of self, and then be able and will-ing to project that warmth and affectionate concernfor others (Karren et al., 2010). Smucker (2001) stated: Love, in its purest unconditional form, is probably life's most powerful force and our greatest spiritualneed. Not only is it important to receive love, butequally important to give love to others. Thinkingabout and caring for the needs of others keeps usfrom being too absorbed with ourselves and ourneeds to the exclusion of others. We all have experi-enced the good feelings that come from caring forand loving others. (p. 10) Love may be a very important key in the healing process. Karren and associates (2010) stated: People who become more loving and less fearful,who replace negative thoughts with the emotion oflove, are often able to achieve physical healing. Mostof us are familiar with the emotional effects of love,the way love makes us feel inside. But . . . true love\u2014a love that is patient, trusting, protecting, optimistic,and kind\u2014has actual physical effects on the body,too. (p. 406) Some researchers suggest that love has a positive effect on the immune system. This has been shown to be true in adults and children, and also in animals(Fox & Fox, 1988; Ornish, 1998). The giving and re-ceiving of love may also result in higher levels of en-dorphins, thereby contributing to a sense of euphoriaand helping to reduce pain. In one long-term study, researchers Werner and Smith (1992) studied children who were reared in im-poverished environments. Their homes were troubledby discord, desertion, or divorce, or marred by parentalalcoholism or mental illness. The subjects were studiedat birth, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Twoout of three of these high-risk children had developedserious learning and/or behavioral problems by age10, or had a record of delinquencies, mental healthproblems, or pregnancies by age 18. One-fourth ofthem had developed \"very serious\" physical and psy-chosocial problems. By the time they reached adult-hood, more than three-fourths of them suffered fromprofound psychological and behavioral problems andeven more were in poor physical health. But of partic-ular interest to the researchers were the 15 to 20 per-cent who remained resilient and well despite theirimpoverished and difficult existence. The childrenwho remained resilient and well had experienced awarm and loving relationship with another person dur-ing their first year of life, whereas the children who de-veloped serious psychological and physical problemshad not. This research indicates that the earlier peoplehave the benefit of a strong, loving relationship, thebetter they seem able to resist the effects of a deleteri-ous lifestyle. Forgiveness Karren and associates (2010) stated, \"Essential to aspiritual nature is forgiveness\u2014the ability to releasefrom the mind all the past hurts and failures, all senseof guilt and loss\" (p. 377). Feelings of bitterness andresentment take a physical toll on an individual bygenerating stress hormones, which maintained forlong periods can have a detrimental effect on a per-son's health. Forgiveness enables a person to cast offresentment and begin the pathway to healing. Forgiveness is not easy. Individuals often have great difficulty when called upon to forgive others and evengreater difficulty in attempting to forgive themselves.Many people carry throughout their lives a sense ofguilt for having committed a mistake for which theydo not believe they have been forgiven or for whichthey have not forgiven themselves. To forgive is not necessarily to condone or excuse one's own or someone else's inappropriate behavior.Karren and associates (2010) have suggested that for-giveness is: . . . an attitude that implies that you are willing to ac- cept responsibility for your perceptions, realizingthat your perceptions are a choice and not an objec-tive fact; a decision to see beyond the limits of an-other's personality, and to gradually transformyourself from being a helpless victim of your circum-stances to being a powerful and loving co-creator ofyour reality. (p. 378) Holding on to grievances causes pain, suffering, and conflict. Forgiveness (of self and others) is a gift to oneself. It offers freedom and peace of mind. It is important for nurses to be able to assess the spiritual needs of their clients. Nurses need not servethe role of professional counselor or spiritual guide,but because of the closeness of their relationship withclients, nurses may be the part of the health-care teamto whom clients may reveal the most intimate detailsof their lives. Smucker (2001) stated: Just as answering a patient's question honestly and with accurate information and responding to hisneeds in a timely and sensitive manner communi-cates caring, so also does high-quality professionalnursing care reach beyond the physical body or theillness to that part of the person where identity, self-worth, and spirit lie. In this sense, good nursing careis also good spiritual care. (pp. 11-12)CHAPTER 6 Cultural and Spiritual Concepts Relevant to Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing 1114092_Ch06_095-120 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 111Religion merely an affiliation, however, it is regular church at- tendance and participation that appear to be the keyfactors. Addressing Spiritual and Religious Needs Through the Nursing Process Assessment It is important for nurses to consider spiritual and re-ligious needs when planning care for their clients.The Joint Commission requires that nurses addressthe psychosocial, spiritual, and cultural variables thatinfluence the perception of illness. Dossey (1998) hasdeveloped a spiritual assessment tool (Box 6-4) aboutwhich she stated, The Spiritual Assessment Tool provides reflective questions for assessing, evaluating, and increasingawareness of spirituality in patients and their signifi-cant others. The tool's reflective questions can facili-tate healing because they stimulate spontaneous,independent, meaningful initiatives to improve thepatient's capacity for recovery and healing (p. 45) Assessing the spiritual needs of a client with a psy- chotic disorder can pose some additional challenges. Approximately 25 percent of people with schizophreniaand 15 to 22 percent of people with bipolar disorderhave religious delusions (Koenig, 2009). Sometimesthese delusions can be difficult to differentiate fromgeneral religious or cultural beliefs but \"longitudinalstudies suggest that nonpsychotic religious activity mayactually improve long-term prognosis in patients withpsychotic disorders\" (Koenig, 2009, p. 288). Engagingfamily members and significant others in the assess-ment process can be a great help in determining whichreligious beliefs and activities have been beneficial tothe patient versus those that have been detrimental tohis or her progress. Diagnoses/Outcome Identification Nursing diagnoses that may be used when addressingspiritual and religious needs of clients include: Risk for spiritual distress Spiritual distress Readiness for enhanced spiritual well-being Risk for impaired religiosity Impaired religiosity Readiness for enhanced religiosity The following outcomes may be used as guidelines for care and to evaluate effectiveness of the nursinginterventions. The client will: 1. Identify meaning and purpose in life that rein-force hope, peace, and contentment.112 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing Religion is one way in which an individual's spiritual-ity may be expressed. There are more than 6500 reli-gions in the world (Bronson, 2005). Some individualsseek out various religions in an attempt to find an-swers to fundamental questions that they have aboutlife, and indeed, about their very existence. Others,although they may regard themselves as spiritual,choose not to affiliate with an organized religiousgroup. In either situation, however, it is inevitable thatquestions related to life and the human conditionarise during the progression of spiritual maturation. Brodd (2009) suggested that all religious traditions manifest seven dimensions: experiential, mythic, doc-trinal, ethical, ritual, social, and material. He explainsthat these seven dimensions are intertwined and com-plementary and, depending on the particular reli-gion, certain dimensions are emphasized more thanothers. For example, Zen Buddhism has a strong ex-periential dimension, but says little about doctrines.Roman Catholicism is strong in both ritual and doc-trine. The social dimension is a significant aspect ofreligion, as it provides a sense of community, of be-longing to a group such as a parish or a congregation,which is empowering for some individuals. Affiliation with a religious group has been shown to be a health-enhancing endeavor (Karren et al.,2010). A number of studies have been conducted thatindicate a correlation between religious faith/churchattendance and increased chance of survival followingserious illness, less depression and other mental ill-ness, longer life, and overall better physical and men-tal health. In an extensive review of the literature,Maryland psychologist John Gartner (1996) foundthat individuals with a religious commitment hadlower suicide rates, lower drug use and abuse, less ju-venile delinquency, lower divorce rates, and improvedmental illness outcomes. It is not known how religious participation protects health and promotes well-being. Some churches ac-tively promote healthy lifestyles and discourage behav-ior that would be harmful to health or interfere withtreatment of disease. But some researchers believe thatthe strong social support network found in churchesmay be the most important force in boosting thehealth and well-being of their members. More so thanCORE CONCEPT Religion A set of beliefs, values, rites, and rituals adopted by a group of people. The practices are usually grounded inthe teachings of a spiritual leader. 4092_Ch06_095-120 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 112CHAPTER 6 Cultural and Spiritual Concepts Relevant to Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing 113 BOX 6-4 Spiritual Assessment Tool The following reflective questions may assist you in assess- ing, evaluating, and increasing awareness of spirituality inyourself and others.

Risk for Spiritual Distress Definition: At risk for an impaired ability to experience and integrate meaning and purpose in life through aconnectedness with self, others, art, music, literature, na-ture, and/or a power greater than oneself (NANDA-I,2012, p. 412). Risk Factors racial/cultural practices Developmental: Life changesEnvironmental: Environmental changes; natural disasters Risk for Impaired Religiosity Definition: At risk for an impaired ability to exercise re- liance on religious beliefs and/or participate in ritualsof a particular faith tradition (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 407). Risk Factors Physical: Illness/hospitalization; pain Psychological: Ineffective support/coping/caregiving; depression; lack of social interaction; cultural bar- rier to practicing social isolation Spiritual: Suffering Environmental: Lack of transportation; environmen- tal barriers to practicing religion Developmental: Life transitions A plan of care addressing client's spiritual/religious needs is presented in Table 6-3. Selected nursing di-agnoses are presented, along with appropriate nursinginterventions and rationales for each. Evaluation Evaluation of nursing actions is directed at achieve-ment of the established outcomes. Part of the evalua-tion process is continuous reassessment to ensure thatthe selected actions are appropriate and the goals andoutcomes are realistic. Including the family and ex-tended support systems in the evaluation process isessential if spiritual and religious implications of nurs-ing care are to be measured. Modifications to theplan of care are made as the need is determined.114 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing Table 6-3 | CARE PLAN FOR THE CLIENT WITH SPIRIT UAL AND RELIGIOUS NEEDS* NURSING DIAGNOSIS: RISK FOR SPIRITUAL DISTRESS RELATED TO: Life changes; environmental changes; stress; anxiety; depression OUTCOME CRITERIA NURSING INTERVENTIONS RATIONALE Client will identify meaning and purpose in life that reinforce hope, peace, contentment, and self-satisfaction.1.Assess current situation. 2.Listen to client's expressions concern, self-blame. 3.Note reason for living whetherit directly related to situation. 4.Determine client's religious/spiritualorientation, current involvement,and presence of conflicts, especiallyin current circumstances. 5.Assess sense of self-concept,wort h, ability to enter into loving relationships.1-8.Thorough assessment is neces- sary to develop an accurate careplan for the client.4092_Ch06_095-120 24/07/14 5:22 PM Page 114CHAPTER 6 Cultural and Spiritual Concepts Relevant to Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing 115 Table 6-3 | CARE PLAN FOR THE CLIENT WITH SPIRIT UAL AND RELIGIOUS NEEDS*\u2014cont'd OUTCOME CRITERIA NURSING INTERVENTIONS RATIONALE 6.Observe behavior indicative of poor relationships with others. 7.Determine support systems avail-able to and used by client andsignificant others. 8.Assess substance use/abuse. 9.Establish an environment thatpromotes free expression of feel-ings and concerns. 10.Have client identify and prioritizecurrent/immediate needs. 11.Discuss philosophical issues related to impact of current situation on spiritual beliefs andvalues. 12.Use therapeutic communicationskills of reflection and active listening. 13.Review coping skills used andtheir effectiveness in current situation. 14.Provide a role model (e.g., nurse,individual experiencing similar situation). 15.Suggest use of journaling. 16.Discuss client's interest in thearts, music, and literature. 17 .Role-play new coping techniques.Discuss possibilities of takingclasses, becoming involved in discussion g roups, or cultural activities of their choice. 18 .Refer client to appropriate resources for help.9.Trust is the basis of a therapeuticnurse-client relationship. 10.Helps client focus on what needsto be done and identify manage-able steps to take. 11.Helps client to understand thatcert ain life experiences can cause individuals to question personalvalues and that this response isnot uncommon. 12.Helps client find own solutions toconcerns. 13.Identifies strengths to incorporateinto plan and techniques thatneed revision. 14.Sharing of experiences and hopeassists client to deal with reality . 15 .Journaling can assist in clarifyingbeliefs and values and in recog-nizing and resolving feelingsabout current life situation. 16.Provides insight into meaning of these issues and how they are integ rated into an individual's life. 17 .These activities will help to en-hance integ ration of new skills and necessary changes in client'slifestyle. 18 .Client may require additional as-sistance with an individual whospecializes in these types of concerns.

Ethnic groups are tied together by a shared heritage. Cultural groups differ in terms of communication,space, social organization, time, environmentalcontrol, and biological variations. Northern European Americans are the descen-dants of the first immigrants to the United Statesand make up the current dominant cultural group.They value punctuality, work responsibility, and ahealthy lifestyle. African Americans trace their roots in the UnitedStates to the days of slavery. Most African Americans have large support systemsand a strong religious orientation. Many have as-similated into and have many of the same charac-teristics as the dominant culture. Some AfricanAmericans from the rural South may receive healthcare from a folk practitioner. Many Native Americans still live on reservations.They speak many different languages and dialects.They often appear silent and reserved and manyare uncomfortable with touch and expressing emo-tions. Health care may be delivered by a healercalled a shaman. Asian American languages are very diverse. Touch-ing during communication has historically beenconsidered unacceptable. Asian Americans mayhave difficulty expressing emotions and appearcold and aloof. Family loyalty is emphasized. Psy-chiatric illness is viewed as behavior that is out ofcontrol and brings shame on the family. The common language of Latino Americans isSpanish. Large family groups are important, andtouch is a common form of communication. Thepredominant religion is Roman Catholicism andthe church is often a source of strength in timesof crisis. Health care may be delivered by a folkhealer called a curandero, who uses various forms of treatment to restore the body to a balancedstate. Western European Americans have their originsin Italy, France, and Greece. They are warm andexpressive and use touch as a common form ofcommunication. The dominant religion is RomanCatholicism for the Italians and French and GreekOrthodoxy for the Greeks. Most Western EuropeanAmericans follow the health practices of the dom-inant culture, but some folk beliefs and supersti-tions endure. Arab Americans trace their ancestry and traditions tothe nomadic desert tribes of the Arabian Peninsula.Arabic is the official language of the Arab worldand the dominant religion is Islam. Mental illness isconsidered a social stigma, and symptoms are often somaticized. The Jewish people came to the United States pre-dominantly from Spain, Portugal, Germany, andEastern Europe. Four main Jewish religious groupsexist today: Orthodox, Reform, Conservative, andReconstructionist. The primary language is Eng-lish. A high value is placed on education. JewishAmericans are very health conscious and practicepreventive health care. The maintenance of one'smental health is considered just as important as themaintenance of one's physical health. Culture-bound syndromes are clusters of physicaland behavioral symptoms that are considered as ill-nesses or \"afflictions\" by specific cultures, but donot readily fit into the Western conventional diag-nostic categories. Spirituality is the human quality that gives meaningand sense of purpose to an individual's existence. Individuals possess a number of spiritual needs thatinclude meaning and purpose in life, faith or trustin someone or something beyond themselves,hope, love, and forgiveness. Religion is a set of beliefs, values, rites, and ritualsadopted by a group of people. Religion is one way in which an individual's spiri-tuality may be expressed. Affiliation with a religious group has been shownto be a health-enhancing endeavor. Nurses must consider cultural, spiritual, and re-ligious needs when planning care for theirclients.CHAPTER 6 Cultural and Spiritual Concepts Relevant to Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing 117 Additional info available at www.davisplus.com4092_Ch06_095-120 24/07/14 5:23 PM Page 117118 UNIT 2 Foundations for Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions: 1. Miss Lee is an Asian American on the psychiatric unit. She tells the nurse, \"I must have the hot ginger root for my headache. It is the only thing that will help.\" What meaning does the nurse attach to this statement by Miss Lee? a. She is being obstinate and wants control over her care. b. She believes that ginger root has magical qualities. c. She subscribes to the restoration of health through the balance of yin and yang. d. Asian Americans refuse to take traditional medicine for pain. 2. Miss Lee, an Asian American on the psychiatric unit, says she is afraid that no one from her family willvisit her. On what belief does Miss Lee base her statement? a. Many Asian Americans do not believe in hospitals. b. Many Asian Americans do not have close family support systems. c. Many Asian Americans believe the body will heal itself if left alone. d. Many Asian Americans view psychiatric problems as bringing shame to the family. 3. Joe, a Native American, appears at the community health clinic with an oozing stasis ulcer on his lowerright leg.

The nurse-client relationship is the foundation on which psychiatric nursing is established. It is a rela-tionship in which both participants must recognizeeach other as unique and important human beings.It is also a relationship in which mutual learning occurs. Peplau (1991) states: Shall a nurse do things for a patient or can participant relationships be emphasized so that a nurse comes to do things with a patient as her share of an agenda of work to be accomplished in reaching a goal\u2014health.It is likely that the nursing process is educative andtherapeutic when nurse and patient can come toknow and to respect each other, as persons who arealike, and yet, different, as persons who share in thesolution of problems. (p. 9) This chapter examines the role of the psychiatric nurse and the use of self as the therapeutic tool in the nursing of clients with emotional illness. Phases of thetherapeutic relationship are explored and conditions essential to the development of a therapeutic relation-ship are discussed. The importance of values clarifica-tion in the development of self-awareness is emphasized.courtesies that are accorded to a new guest who has been brought into any situation. This principle im-plies: (1) accepting the patient as he is; (2) treatingthe patient as an emotionally able stranger and relat-ing to him on this basis until evidence shows him tobe otherwise. (p. 44) 2. The Resource Person. According to Peplau , \"a resource person provides specific answers to ques- tions usually formulated with relation to a largerproblem\" (p. 47). In the role of resource person,the nurse explains, in language that the client canunderstand, information related to the client' s health care. 3. The Teacher. In this subrole the nurse identifies learning needs and provides information required by the client or family to improve the health situation. 4. The Leader. According to Peplau, \"democratic leadership in nursing situations implies that thepatient will be permitted to be an active partici-pant in designing nursing plans for him\" (p. 49).Autocratic leadership promotes overvaluation of the nurse and clients' substitution of the nurse' s goals for their own. Laissez-faire leaders convey alack of personal interest in the client. 5. The Surrogate. Outside of their awareness, clients often perceive nurses as symbols of other individ-uals. They may view the nurse as a mother figure,a sibling, a former teacher, or another nurse who has provided care in the past. This occurs when a client is placed in a situation that generates feelings similar to ones he or she has experiencedpreviously. Peplau (1991) explained that the nurse-client relationship progresses along a continuum.When a client is acutely ill, he or she may incur therole of infant or child, while the nurse is perceivedas the mother surrogate. Peplau (1991) stated,\"Each nurse has the responsibility for exercisingher professional skill in aiding the relationship tomove forward on the continuum, so that person toperson relations compatible with chronologicalage levels can develop\" (p. 55). 6. The Technical Expert. The nurse understands various professional devices and possesses the clinical skills necessar y to perform the interven- tions that are in the best interest of the client. 7. The Counselor. The nurse uses \"interpersonal techniques\" to assist clients to learn to adapt to dif-ficulties or changes in life experiences. Peplau(1991) stated, \"Counseling in nursing has to dowith helping the patient to remember and to understand fully what is happening to him in thepresent situation, so that the experience can be in-tegrated with, rather than dissociated from, otherexperiences in life\" (p. 64). Peplau (1962) believed that the emphasis in psy- chiatric nursing is on the counseling subrole. HowRole of the Psychiatric Nurse What is a nurse? Undoubtedly, this question wouldelicit as many different answers as the number of peo-ple to whom it was presented. Nursing as a concept has probably existed since the beginning of the civilizedworld, with the provision of \"care\" to the ill or infirmby anyone in the environment who took the time toadminister to those in need. However, the emergenceof nursing as a profession only began in the late 1800s with the graduation of Linda Richards from the NewEngland Hospital for Women and Children in Bostonupon achievement of the diploma in nursing. Sincethat time, the nurse's role has evolved from that ofcustodial caregiver and physician's handmaiden torecognition as a unique, independent of theprofessional health-care team. Peplau (1991) identified several subroles within the role of the nurse: 1. The Stranger. A nurse is at first a stranger to the client. The client is also a stranger to the nurse.Peplau (1991) stated: Respect and positive interest accorded a stranger is at first nonpersonal and includes the same ordinary4092_Ch07_121-134 23/07/14 11:50 AM Page 123124 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care then does this emphasis influence the role of the nurse in the psychiatric setting? Many sources definethe nurse therapist as having graduate preparation in psychiatric/mental health nursing. He or she has developed skills through intensive supervised educa-tional experiences to provide helpful individual,group, or family therapy. Peplau suggested that it is essential for the staff nurse working in psychiatry to have a general knowledge of basic counseling techniques. A therapeutic or\"helping\" relationship is established through use ofthese interpersonal techniques and is based on asound knowledge of theories of personality develop-ment and human behavior. Sullivan (1953) believed that emotional problems stem from difficulties with interpersonal relation-ships. Interpersonal theorists, such as Peplau and Sullivan, emphasize the importance of relationshipdevelopment in the provision of emotional care.Through establishment of a satisfactory nurse-clientrelationship, individuals learn to generalize the abilityto achieve satisfactory interpersonal relationships toother aspects of their lives. Dynamics of a Therapeutic Nurse-Client Relationship Travelbee (1971), who expanded on Peplau's theoryof interpersonal relations in nursing, has stated thatit is only when each individual in the interactionperceives the other as a unique human being that arelationship is possible. She refers not to a nurse-client relationship, but rather to a human-to-humanrelationship, which she describes as a \"mutually significant experience.\" That is, both the nurse and the recipient of care have needs met when eachviews the other as a unique human being, not as \"an illness,\" as \"a room number,\" or as \"all nurses\"in general. Therapeutic relationships are goal oriented. Ide- ally, the nurse and client decide together what thegoal of the relationship will be. Most often the goal is directed at learning and growth promotion, in aneffort to bring about some type of change in theclient's life. In general, the goal of a therapeutic rela-tionship may be based on a problem-solving model. EXAMPLE Goal The client will demonstrate more adaptive coping strategiesfor dealing with (specific life situation).Interventions Identify what is troubling the client at the present time. Encourage the client to discuss changes he or she would like to make.Discuss with the client which changes are possible and which are not possible. Have the client explore feelings about aspects that cannot be changed and alternative ways of coping moreadaptively. Discuss alternative strategies for creating changes the client desires to make. Weigh the benefits and consequences of each alternative. Assist the client to select an alternative. Encourage the client to implement the change. Provide positive feedback for the client's attempts to create change. Assist the client to evaluate outcomes of the change and make modifications as required. Therapeutic Use of Self Travelbee (1971) described the instrument for deliv- ery of the process of interpersonal nursing as the therapeutic use of self , which she defined as \"the ability to use one's personality consciously and in full aware-ness in an attempt to establish relatedness and tostructure nursing intervention\" (p. 19). Use of the self in a therapeutic manner requires that the nurse have a great deal of self-awarenessand self-understanding, having arrived at a philo-sophical belief about life, death, and the overallhuman condition. The nurse must understand thatthe ability and extent to which one can effectivelyhelp others in time of need is strongly influencedby this internal value system\u2014a combination of in-tellect and emotions. Gaining Self-Awareness Values Clarification Knowing and understanding oneself enhances theability to form satisfactory interpersonal relationships.Self-awareness requires that an individual recognizeand accept what he or she values and learn to acceptthe uniqueness and differences in others. This con-cept is important in everyday life and in the nursingprofession in general; but it is essential in psychiatric nursing. An individual's value system is established very early in life and has its foundations in the value systemheld by the primary caregivers. It is culturally ori-ented; it may change many times over the course of a lifetime; and it consists of beliefs, attitudes, and values. Values clarification is one process by which anindividual may gain self-awareness. Beliefs A belief is an idea that one holds to be true, and it can take any of several forms: Rational beliefs. Ideas for which objective evidenceexists to substantiate their truth.4092_Ch07_121-134 23/07/14 11:50 AM Page 124EXAMPLE Alcoholism is a disease. Irrational beliefs . Ideas that an individual holds as true despite the existence of objective contradictory evi- dence. Delusions can be a form of irrational beliefs. EXAMPLE Once an alcoholic has been through detox and rehab, he or she can drink socially if desired. Faith (sometimes called \"blind beliefs\"). An ideal that an individual holds as true for which no objective evidence exists. EXAMPLE Belief in a higher power can help an alcoholic stop drinking. Stereotype. A socially shared belief that describes aconcept in an oversimplified or undifferentiatedmatter. EXAMPLE All alcoholics are skid-row bums. Attitudes An attitude is a frame of reference around which an individual organizes knowledge about his or herworld. An attitude also has an emotional component.It can be a prejudgment and may be selective and biased. Attitudes fulfill the need to find meaning inlife and to provide clarity and consistency for the individual. The prevailing stigma attached to mentalillness is an example of a negative attitude. An associ-ated belief might be that \"all people with mental illness are dangerous.\" Values Values are abstract standards, positive or negative, that represent an individual's ideal mode of conductand ideal goals. Some examples of ideal modes ofconduct include seeking truth and beauty; beingclean and orderly; and behaving with sincerity, justice,reason, compassion, humility, respect, honor, and loy-alty. Examples of ideal goals are security, happiness,freedom, equality, ecstasy, fame, and power. Values differ from attitudes and beliefs in that they are action oriented or action producing. One mayhold many attitudes and beliefs without behaving ina way that shows they hold those attitudes and beliefs.For example, a nurse may believe that all clients havethe right to be told the truth about their diagnosis;however, he or she may not always act on the beliefand tell all clients the complete truth about their condition. Only when the belief is acted on does it become a value. Attitudes and beliefs flow out of one's set of values. An individual may have thousands of beliefs and hun-dreds of attitudes, but his or her values probably onlynumber in the dozens. Values may be viewed as a kindof core concept or basic standards that determineone's attitudes and beliefs, and ultimately, one's be-havior. Raths, Harmin, and Simon (1978) identifieda seven-step process of valuing that can be used tohelp clarify personal values. This process is presentedin Table 7-1. The process can be used by applyingthese seven steps to an attitude or belief that oneholds. When an attitude or belief has met each of theseven criteria, it can be considered a value. The Johari Window The self arises out of self-appraisal and the appraisalof others and represents each individual's unique pat-tern of values, attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, emotions,and needs. Self-awareness is the recognition of theseaspects and understanding about their impact on theself and others. The Johari Window is a representa-tion of the self and a tool that can be used to increaseCHAPTER 7 Relationship Development 125 TABLE 7-1 The Process of Values Clarification LEVEL OF OPERATIONS CATEGORY CRITERIA EXPLANATION Cognitive Emotional Behavioral\"This value is mine.

The Johari Window is presented in Figure 7-1 and is divided into four quadrants. The Open or Public Self The upper left quadrant of the window represents thepart of the self that is public; that is, aspects of theself about which both the individual and others areaware. EXAMPLE Susan, a nurse who is the adult child of an alcoholic, has strong feelings about helping alcoholics to achieve sobriety.She volunteers her time to be a support person on call to help recovering alcoholics. She is aware of her feelingsand her desire to help others. Members of the AlcoholicsAnonymous group in which she volunteers her time are also aware of Susan's feelings and they feel comfort-able calling her when they need help refraining from drinking. The Unknowing Self The upper right quadrant of the window represents the part of the self that is known to others but remainshidden from the awareness of the individual. EXAMPLE When Susan takes care of patients in detox, she does so with- out emotion, tending to the technical aspects of the task in away that the clients perceive as cold and judgmental. She isunaware that she comes across to the clients in this way. The Private Self The lower left quadrant of the window represents the part of the self that is known to the individual, butwhich the individual deliberately and consciously conceals from others.EXAMPLE Susan would prefer not to take care of the clients in detox because doing so provokes painful memories from her child-hood. However, because she does not want the other staffmembers to know about these feelings, she volunteers totake care of the detox clients whenever they are assigned toher unit. The Unknown Self The lower right quadrant of the window represents the part of the self that is unknown to both the individualand to others. EXAMPLE Susan felt very powerless as a child growing up with an alco- holic father. She seldom knew in what condition she wouldfind her father or what his behavior would be. She learnedover the years to find small ways to maintain control over herlife situation, and left home as soon as she graduated fromhigh school. The need to stay in control has always been veryimportant to Susan, and she is unaware that working with re-covering alcoholics helps to fulfill this need in her. The peopleshe is helping are also unaware that Susan is satisfying an un-fulfilled personal need as she provides them with assistance. The goal of increasing self-awareness by using the Johari Window is to increase the size of the quadrant that represents the open or public self. The individualwho is open to self and others has the ability to bespontaneous and to share emotions and experienceswith others. This individual also has a greater under-standing of personal behavior and of others' responsesto him or her. Increased self-awareness allows an individual to interact with others comfortably, to ac-cept the differences in others, and to observe eachperson's right to respect and dignity.126 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Known to self Unknown to self Known to Others Unknown to OthersThe open or public selfThe unknowing self The unknown selfThe private selfFIGURE 7-1 Window.

Mayfield Publishing: Palo Alto, CA. 1984, with permission.)4092_Ch07_121-134 23/07/14 11:50 AM Page 126Conditions Essential to Development of a Therapeutic Relationship Several characteristics that enhance the achievement of a therapeutic relationship have been identified.These concepts are highly significant to the use of selfas the therapeutic tool in interpersonal relationshipdevelopment. Rapport Getting acquainted and establishing rapport is the primary task in relationship development. Rapportimplies special feelings on the part of both the clientand the nurse based on acceptance, warmth, friend-liness, common interest, a sense of trust, and a non-judgmental attitude. Establishing rapport may beaccomplished by discussing non-health-related topics.Travelbee (1971) states: [To establish rapport] is to create a sense of harmony based on knowledge and appreciation of each indi-vidual's uniqueness. It is the ability to be still and ex-perience the other as a human being\u2014to appreciatethe unfolding of each personality one to the other.The ability to truly care for and about others is thecore of rapport. (pp. 152; 155) Trust To trust another, one must feel confidence in that person's presence, reliability, integrity, veracity, andsincere desire to provide assistance when requested.As discussed in Chapter 3, trust is the initial develop-mental task described by Erikson. If the task has notbeen achieved, this component of relationship devel-opment becomes more difficult. That is not to say thattrust cannot be established, but only that additionaltime and patience may be required on the part of thenurse. CLINICAL PEARL The nurse must convey an aura of trustwor- thiness, which requires that he or she possess a sense of self-confidence. Confidence in the self is derived out of knowledgegained through achievement of personal and professionalgoals, as well as the ability to integrate these roles and to function as a unified whole. Trust cannot be presumed; it must be earned. Trustworthiness is demonstrated through nursing in- terventions that convey a sense of warmth and caringto the client. These interventions are initiated simplyand concretely and directed toward activities that address the client's basic needs for physiological andpsychological safety and security. Many psychiatricclients experience concrete thinking , which focuses their thought processes on specifics rather than gen-eralities, and immediate issues rather than eventualoutcomes. Examples of nursing interventions thatwould promote trust in an individual who is thinkingconcretely include the following: Providing a blanket when the client is cold Providing food when the client is hungry Keeping promises Being honest (e.g., saying \"I don't know the answerto your question, but I'll try to find out\") and thenfollowing through Simply and clearly providing reasons for certainpolicies, procedures, and rules Providing a written, structured schedule of activities Attending activities with the client if he or she is reluctant to go alone Being consistent in adhering to unit guidelines Taking the client's preferences, requests, and opin-ions into consideration when possible in decisionsconcerning his or her care Ensuring confidentiality; providing reassurance that what is discussed will not be repeated outsidethe boundaries of the health-care team Trust is the basis of a therapeutic relationship. The nurse working in psychiatry must perfect the skillsthat foster the development of trust. Trust must be established in order for the nurse-client relationshipto progress beyond the superficial level of tending tothe client's immediate needs. Respect To show respect is to believe in the dignity and worthof an individual regardless of his or her unacceptablebehavior. The psychologist Carl Rogers called this unconditional positive regard (Raskin, Rogers, & Witty, 2011). The attitude is nonjudgmental, and therespect is unconditional in that it does not dependon the behavior of the client to meet certain stan-dards. The nurse, in fact, may not approve of theclient's lifestyle or pattern of behaving. However, with unconditional positive regard, the client is ac-cepted and respected for no other reason than thathe or she is considered to be a worthwhile and uniquehuman being. Many psychiatric clients have very little self-respect because, as a result of their behavior, they have beenrejected by others in the past. Recognition that theyare being accepted and respected as unique individ-uals on an unconditional basis can serve to elevatefeelings of self-worth and self-respect. The nurse canconvey an attitude of respect by: Calling the client by name (and title, if he or sheprefers) Spending time with the client Allowing for sufficient time to answer the client'squestions and concernsCHAPTER 7 Relationship Development 1274092_Ch07_121-134 23/07/14 11:50 AM Page 127Promoting an atmosphere of privacy during thera- peutic interactions with the client or when the clientmay be undergoing physical examination or therapy Always being open and honest with the client, evenwhen the truth may be difficult to discuss Taking the client's ideas, preferences, and opinionsinto consideration when planning care Striving to understand the motivation behind theclient's behavior, regardless of how unacceptable itmay seem Genuineness The concept of genuineness refers to the nurse's abil- ity to be open, honest, and \"real\" in interactions withthe client. To be \"real\" is to be aware of what one isexperiencing internally and to allow the quality of thisinner experiencing to be apparent in the therapeuticrelationship. When one is genuine, there is congruencebetween what is felt and what is being expressed(Raskin, Rogers, & Witty, 2011). The nurse who pos-sesses the quality of genuineness responds to theclient with truth and honesty, rather than with re-sponses he or she may consider more \"professional\"or ones that merely reflect the \"nursing role.\" Genuineness may call for a degree of self-disclosure on the part of the nurse. This is not to say that thenurse must disclose to the client everything he or she is feeling or all personal experiences that may relate to what the client is going through. Indeed, care mustbe taken when using self-disclosure, to avoid reversingthe roles of nurse and client. When the nurse uses self-disclosure, a quality of \"humanness\" is revealed to the client, creating a rolefor the client to model in similar situations. The clientmay then feel more comfortable revealing personalinformation to the nurse. Most individuals have an uncanny ability to detect other peoples' artificiality. When the nurse does notbring the quality of genuineness to the relationship,a reality base for trust cannot be established. Thesequalities are essential if the actualizing potential ofthe client is to be realized and for change and growthto occur (Raskin, Rogers, & Witty, 2011). Empathy Empathy is the ability to see beyond outward behavior and to understand the situation from the client'spoint of view. With empathy, the nurse can accuratelyperceive and comprehend the meaning and rele-vance of the client's thoughts and feelings. The nursemust also be able to communicate this perception tothe client by attempting to translate words and behav-iors into feelings. It is not uncommon for the concept of empathy to be confused with that of sympathy . The major difference is that with empathy the nurse \"accurately perceives or understands\" what the client is feelingand encourages the client to explore these feelings.With sympathy the nurse actually \"shares\" what the client is feeling, and experiences a need to alleviatedistress. Schuster (2000) stated: Empathy means that you remain emotionally sepa- rate from the other person, even though you can seethe patient's viewpoint clearly. This is different fromsympathy. Sympathy implies taking on the other'sneeds and problems as if they were your own and be-coming emotionally involved to the point of losingyour objectivity. To empathize rather than sympa-thize, you must show feelings but not get caught upin feelings or overly identify with the patient's andfamily's concerns. (p. 102) Empathy is considered to be one of the most important characteristics of a therapeutic relation- ship. Accurate empathetic perceptions on the partof the nurse assist the client to identify feelings that may have been suppressed or denied. Positiveemotions are generated as the client realizes that he or she is truly understood by another. As the feelings surface and are explored, the client learnsaspects about self of which he or she may have been unaware. This contributes to the process ofpersonal identification and the promotion of posi-tive self-concept. With empathy, while understanding the client's thoughts and feelings, the nurse is able to maintainsufficient objectivity to allow the client to achieveproblem resolution with minimal assistance. Withsympathy, the nurse actually feels what the client is feeling, objectivity is lost, and the nurse may become focused on relief of personal distress rather than on helping the client resolve the prob-lem at hand. The following is an example of an empathetic and sympathetic response to the samesituation. EXAMPLE Situation: BJ is a client on the psychiatric unit with a diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia). She is 5\u00b45 tall and weighs 295 lb. BJ has been overweight all her life.She is single, has no close friends, and has never had anintimate relationship with another person. It is her first dayon the unit, and she is refusing to come out of her room.When she appeared for lunch in the dining room followingadmission, she was embarrassed when several of theother clients laughed out loud and called her \"fatso.\" Sympathetic response: Nurse: \"I can certainly identify with what you are feeling. I've been overweight most of mylife, too. I just get so angry when people act like that. Theyare so insensitive! It's just so typical of skinny people to act that way. You have a right to want to stay away 128 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch07_121-134 23/07/14 11:50 AM Page 128from them. We'll just see how loud they laugh when you get to choose what movie is shown on the unit after dinner tonight.\" Empathetic response: Nurse: \"You feel angry and embar- rassed by what happened at lunch today.\" As tears fillBJ's eyes, the nurse encourages her to cry if she feelslike it and to express her anger at the situation. She stayswith BJ but does not dwell on her ownfeelings about what happened. Instead she focuses on BJ and whatthe client perceives are her most immediate needs atthis time. Phases of a Therapeutic Nurse-Client Relationship Psychiatric nurses use interpersonal relationship de- velopment as the primary intervention with clients in various psychiatric/mental health settings. This iscongruent with Peplau's (1962) identification of coun-seling as the major subrole of nursing in psychiatry. Sullivan (1953), from whom Peplau patterned herown interpersonal theory of nursing, strongly be-lieved that many emotional problems were closely related to difficulties with interpersonal relationships.With this concept in mind, this role of the nurse inpsychiatry becomes especially meaningful and pur-poseful. It becomes an integral part of the total ther-apeutic regimen. The therapeutic interpersonal relationship is the means by which the nursing process is imple-mented. Through the relationship, problems areidentified and resolution is sought. Tasks of the relationship have been categorized into four phases:(1) the preinteraction phase, (2) the orientation(introductory) phase, (3) the working phase, and(4) the termination phase. Although each phase ispresented as specific and distinct from the others,there may be some overlapping of tasks, particularlywhen the interaction is limited. The major nursinggoals during each phase of the nurse-client relation-ship are listed in Table 7-2.The Preinteraction Phase The preinteraction phase involves preparation for thefirst encounter with the client. Tasks include the following: Obtaining available information about the clientfrom his or her chart, significant others, or otherhealth-team members. From this information, theinitial assessment is begun. This initial informationmay also allow the nurse to become aware of per-sonal responses to knowledge about the client. Examining one's feelings, fears, and anxietiesabout working with a particular client. For exam-ple, the nurse may have been reared in an alco-holic family and have ambivalent feelings aboutcaring for a client who is alcohol dependent. All individuals bring attitudes and feelings from priorexperiences to the clinical setting. The nurse needsto be aware of how these preconceptions may affecthis or her ability to care for individual clients. The Orientation (Introductory) Phase During the orientation phase, the nurse and clientbecome acquainted. Tasks include: Creating an environment for the establishment oftrust and rapport Establishing a contract for intervention that detailsthe expectations and responsibilities of both nurseand client Gathering assessment information to build a strongclient database Identifying the client's strengths and limitations Formulating nursing diagnoses Setting goals that are mutually agreeable to thenurse and client Developing a plan of action that is realistic formeeting the established goals Exploring feelings of both the client and nurse interms of the introductory phase Introductions are often uncomfortable, and the participants may experience some anxiety until a degree of rapport has been established. Interactionsmay remain on a superficial level until anxiety sub-sides. Several interactions may be required to fulfillthe tasks associated with this phase. The Working Phase The therapeutic work of the relationship is accom-plished during this phase. Tasks include: Maintaining the trust and rapport that was estab-lished during the orientation phase Promoting the client's insight and perception ofreality Problem-solving using the model presented earlierin this chapterCHAPTER 7 Relationship Development 129 TABLE 7-2 Phases of Relationship Development and Major Nursing Goals PHASE GOALS 1.

Transference Transference occurs when the client unconsciously displaces (or \"transfers\") to the nurse feelings formedtoward a person from his or her past (Sadock &Sadock, 2007). These feelings toward the nurse maybe triggered by something about the nurse's appear-ance or personality characteristics that reminds theclient of the person. Transference can interfere withthe therapeutic interaction when the feelings beingexpressed include anger and hostility. Anger towardthe nurse can be manifested by uncooperativenessand resistance to the therapy. Transference can also take the form of overwhelm- ing affection for the nurse or excessive dependencyon the nurse. The nurse is overvalued and the clientforms unrealistic expectations of the nurse. When thenurse is unable to fulfill those expectations or meetthe excessive dependency needs, the client becomesangry and hostile. Interventions for Transference Hilz (2012) states: In cases of transference, the relationship does not usually need to be terminated, except when the trans-ference poses a serious barrier to therapy or safety.The nurse should work with the patient in sorting outthe past from the present, and assist the patient intoidentifying the transference and reassign a new andmore appropriate meaning to the current nurse-patient relationship. The goal is to guide patients toward independence by teaching them to assume re-sponsibility for their own behaviors, feelings, andthoughts, and to assign the correct meanings to therelationships based on present circumstances insteadof the past. Countertransference Countertransference refers to the nurse's behavioral and emotional response to the client. These re- sponses may be related to unresolved feelings towardsignificant others from the nurse's past, or they maybe generated in response to transference feelings onthe part of the client. It is not easy to refrain from be-coming angry when the client is consistently antago-nistic, to feel flattered when showered with affectionand attention by the client, or even to feel quite pow-erful when the client exhibits excessive dependencyon the nurse. These feelings can interfere with thetherapeutic relationship when they initiate the follow-ing types of behaviors: The nurse overidentifies with the client's feelings,as they remind him or her of problems from thenurse's past or present. The nurse and client develop a social or personalrelationship. The nurse begins to give advice or attempts to \"rescue\" the client. The nurse encourages and promotes the client'sdependence. The nurse's anger engenders feelings of disgust toward the client. The nurse feels anxious and uneasy in the presenceof the client. The nurse is bored and apathetic in sessions withthe client. The nurse has difficulty setting limits on the client'sbehavior. The nurse defends the client's behavior to otherstaff members. The nurse may be completely unaware or only minimally aware of the countertransference as it is occurring (Hilz, 2012). Interventions for Countertransference Hilz (2012) states: The relationship usually should not be terminated in the presence of countertransference. Rather, thenurse or staff member experiencing the countertrans-ference should be supportively assisted by other staffmembers to identify his or her feelings and behaviorsand recognize the occurrence of the phenomenon. Itmay be helpful to have evaluative sessions with thenurse after his or her encounter with the patient, inwhich both the nurse and other staff members (whoare observing the interactions) discuss and comparethe exhibited behaviors in the relationship. The Termination Phase Termination of the relationship may occur for a variety of reasons: the mutually agreed-on goals mayhave been reached; the client may be dischargedfrom the hospital; or, in the case of a student nurse,it may be the end of a clinical rotation. Terminationcan be a difficult phase for both the client and nurse.The main task involves bringing a therapeutic conclu-sion to the relationship. This occurs when: Progress has been made toward attainment of mutually set goals. A plan for continuing care or for assistance duringstressful life experiences is mutually established bythe nurse and client. Feelings about termination of the relationship arerecognized and explored. Both the nurse and130 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch07_121-134 23/07/14 11:50 AM Page 130client may experience feelings of sadness and loss. The nurse should share his or her feelings with theclient. Through these interactions, the client learnsthat it is acceptable to have these kinds of feelingsat a time of separation. With this knowledge, theclient experiences growth during the process oftermination. CLINICAL PEARL When the client feels sadness and loss, behav- iors to delay termination may become evident. If the nurse ex-periences the same feelings, he or she may allow the client'sbehaviors to delay termination. For therapeutic closure, the nurse must establish the reality of the separation and resist being manipulated into repeated delays by the client. Boundaries in the Nurse-Client Relationship A boundary indicates a border or a limit. It deter- mines the extent of acceptable limits. Many types ofboundaries exist. Examples include the following: Material boundaries. These are physical property that can be seen, such as fences that border land. Social boundaries. These are established within a culture and define how individuals are expected tobehave in social situations. Personal boundaries. These are boundaries that in- dividuals define for themselves. They include phys- ical distance boundaries, or just how close individualswill allow others to invade their physical space; andemotional boundaries, or how much individualschoose to disclose of their most private and inti-mate selves to others. Professional boundaries. These boundaries limit and outline expectations for appropriate profes-sional relationships with clients. They separatetherapeutic behavior from any other behavior that, well intentioned or not, could lessen the ben-efit of care to clients (College and Association ofRegistered Nurses of Alberta [CARNA], 2005). Concerns regarding professional boundaries are commonly related to the following issues: Self-disclosure. Self-disclosure on the part of the nurse may be appropriate when it is judged thatthe information may therapeutically benefit theclient. It should never be undertaken for the pur-pose of meeting the nurse's needs. Gift-giving. Individuals who are receiving care often feel indebted toward health-care providers. And, in-deed, gift-giving may be part of the therapeuticprocess for people who receive care (CARNA,2005). Cultural beliefs and values may also enterinto the decision of whether to accept a gift from a client. In some cultures, failure to do so would be interpreted as an insult (Pies, 2012). Acceptingfinancial gifts is never appropriate, but in some in-stances nurses may be permitted to suggest insteada donation to a charity of the client's choice. If acceptance of a small gift of gratitude is deemedappropriate, the nurse may choose to share it withother staff members who have been involved in theclient's care. In all instances, nurses should exer-cise professional judgment when deciding whetherto accept a gift from a client. Attention should begiven to what the gift-giving means to the client, aswell as to institutional policy, the American NursesAssociation (ANA) Code of Ethics for Nurses, and theANA Scope and Standards of Practice. Touch. Nursing by its very nature involves touching clients. Touching is required to perform the manytherapeutic procedures involved in the physicalcare of clients. Caring touch is the touching ofclients when there is no physical need (RegisteredNurses Association of British Columbia [RNABC],2003). Caring touch often provides comfort or encouragement and, when it is used appropriately,it can have a therapeutic effect on the client. How-ever, certain vulnerable clients may misinterpretthe meaning of touch. Certain cultures, such as Native Americans and Asian Americans, are oftenuncomfortable with touch. The nurse must be sensitive to these cultural nuances and aware whentouch is crossing a personal boundary. Additionally,clients who are experiencing high levels of anxietyor exhibiting suspicious or psychotic behaviors may interpret touch as aggressive. These are timeswhen touch should be avoided or considered withextreme caution. Friendship or romantic association. When a nurse is acquainted with a client, the relationship mustmove from one of a personal nature to profes-sional. If the nurse is unable to accomplish this separation, he or she should withdraw from thenurse-client relationship. Likewise, nurses mustguard against personal relationships developing asa result of the nurse-client relationship. Romantic,sexual, or similar personal relationships are neverappropriate between nurse and client. Certain warning signs exist that indicate that pro- fessional boundaries of the nurse-client relationshipmay be in jeopardy. Some of these include the follow-ing (Coltrane & Pugh, 1978): Favoring one client's care over that of another Keeping secrets with a client Changing dress style for working with a particularclient Swapping client assignments to care for a particu-lar client Giving special attention or treatment to one clientover othersCHAPTER 7 Relationship Development 1314092_Ch07_121-134 23/07/14 11:50 AM Page 131Spending free time with a client Frequently thinking about the client when away from work Sharing personal information or work concernswith the client Receiving of gifts or continued contact/communi-cation with the client after discharge Boundary crossings can threaten the integrity of the nurse-client relationship. Nurses must gain self-awareness and insight to be able to recognize whenprofessional integrity is being compromised. Peternelj-Taylor and Yonge (2003) stated: The nursing profession needs nurses who have the ability to make decisions about boundaries based onthe best interests of the clients in their care. This requires nurses to reflect on their knowledge and ex-periences, on how they think and how they feel, andnot simply to buy blindly into a framework that says,\"do this,\" \"don't do that.\" (p. 65) Summary and Key Points Nurses who work in the psychiatric/mental health field use special skills, or \"interpersonal techniq ues,\" to assist clients in adapting to difficulties or changesin life experiences. Therapeutic nurse-client relationships are goal oriented, and the problem-solving model is used to try to bring about some type of change in theclient's life. The instrument for delivery of the process of inter-personal nursing is the therapeutic use of self,which requires that the nurse possess a strong senseof self-awareness and self-understanding. Hildegard Peplau identified of nurse: stranger, resource person, teacher,leader, surrogate, technical expert, and counselor. Characteristics that enhance the achievement of a therapeutic relationship include rapport, trust,respect, genuineness, and empathy. Phases of a therapeutic nurse-client relationship include the preinteraction phase, the orientation(introductory) phase, the working phase, and thetermination phase. Transference occurs when the client unconsciouslydisplaces (or \"transfers\") to the nurse feelingsformed toward a person from the past. Countertransference refers to the nurse's behav-ioral and emotional response to the client. Theseresponses may be related to unresolved feelings toward significant others from the nurse's past, orthey may be generated in response to transferencefeelings on the part of the client. Types of boundaries include material, social, per-sonal, and professional. Concerns associated with professional boundariesinclude self-disclosure, gift-giving, touch, and de-veloping a friendship or romantic association. Boundary crossings can threaten the integrity ofthe nurse-client relationship.132 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Additional info available at www.davisplus.com Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

Development of the therapeutic interpersonal relationship was described in Chapter 7 as the process by whichnurses provide care for clients in need of psychosocialintervention. Therapeutic use of self was identified as the instrument for delivery of care. The focus of thischapter is on techniques\u2014or, more specifically, interper-sonal communication techniques\u2014to facilitate the deliv-ery of that care. Hays and Larson (1963) stated, \"To relate thera- peutically with a patient it is necessary for the nurse4092_Ch08_135-149 24/07/14 6:05 PM Page 135to understand his or her role and its relationship to the patient's illness\" (p. 1). They describe the role ofthe nurse as providing the client with the opportunityto accomplish the following: 1.Identify and explore problems in relating to others. 2.Discover healthy ways of meeting emotional needs. 3.Experience a satisfying interpersonal relationship. These goals are achieved through use of interper- sonal communication techniques (both verbal andnonverbal). The nurse must be aware of the therapeu-tic or nontherapeutic value of the communicationtechniques used with the client because they are the\"tools\" of psychosocial inter vention.these conditions include one's value system, internal-ized attitudes and beliefs, culture or religion, socialstatus, gender, background knowledge and experi-ence, and age or developmental level. The type of en-vironment in which the communication takes placemay also influence the outcome of the transaction.Figure 8-2 shows how these influencing factors are po-sitioned on the transactional model. Values, Attitudes, and Beliefs Values, attitudes, and beliefs are learned ways of think-ing. Children generally adopt the value systems andinternalize the attitudes and beliefs of their parents.Children may retain this way of thinking into adult-hood or develop a different set of attitudes and valuesas they mature. Values, attitudes, and beliefs can influence commu- nication in numerous ways. For example, prejudice isexpressed verbally through negative stereotyping. One's value system may be communicated with be- haviors that are more symbolic in nature. For exam-ple, an individual who values youth may dress andbehave in a manner that is characteristic of one whois much younger. Persons who value freedom and theAmerican way of life may fly the U.S. flag in front oftheir homes each day. In each of these situations, amessage is being communicated. Culture or Religion Communication has its roots in culture. Culturalmores, norms, ideas, and customs provide the basis136 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care CORE CONCEPT Communication An interactive process of transmitting information be- tween two or more entities. What Is Communication? It has been said that individuals \"cannot not commu- nicate.\" Every word that is spoken, every movement that is made, and every action that is taken or failedto be taken gives a message to someone. Interper-sonal communication is a transaction between the sender and the receiver. In the transactional modelof communication, both participants simultaneouslyperceive each other, listen to each other, and are mu-tually involved in creating meaning in a relationship.The transactional model is illustrated in Figure 8-1. The Impact of Preexisting Conditions In all interpersonal transactions, both the sender andreceiver bring certain preexisting conditions to theexchange that influence both the intended messageand the way in which it is interpreted. Examples of FIGURE 8-1 The Transactional Model of Communication.

Cultural values are learned and differ from society to society. For example, insome European countries (e.g., Italy, Spain, andFrance), men may greet each other with hugs andkisses. These behaviors are appropriate in those cul-tures but may communicate a different message inthe United States or England. Religion can influence communication as well. Priests and ministers who wear clerical collars publiclycommunicate their mission in life. The collar mayalso influence the way in which others relate to them,either positively or negatively. Other symbolic ges-tures, such as wearing a cross around the neck orhanging a crucifix on the wall, also communicate anindividual's religious beliefs. Social Status Studies of nonverbal indicators of social status orpower have suggested that high-status persons are as-sociated with gestures that communicate their higher-power position. For example, they use less eyecontact, have a more relaxed posture, use loudervoice pitch, place hands on hips more frequently, are\"power dressers,\" have greater height, and maintainmore distance when communicating with individualsconsidered to be of lower social status. Gender Gender influences the manner in which individualscommunicate. Most cultures have gender signals that are recognized as either masculine or feminine and pro-vide a basis for distinguishing between members ofeach gender. Examples include differences in posture,both standing and sitting, between many men andwomen in the United States. Men usually stand withthighs 10 to 15 degrees apart, the pelvis rolled back,and the arms slightly away from the body. Womenoften are seen with legs close together, the pelvis tippedforward, and the arms close to the body. When sitting,men may lean back in the chair with legs apart or mayrest the ankle of one leg over the knee of the other.Women tend to sit more upright in the chair with legstogether, perhaps crossed at the ankles, or one legcrossed over the other at thigh level. Roles have historically been identified as either male or female. For example, in the United States masculin-ity typically was communicated through such roles ashusband, father, breadwinner, doctor, lawyer, or engi-neer. Traditional female roles included those of wife,mother, homemaker, nurse, teacher, or secretary. Gender signals are changing in U.S. society as sexual roles become less distinct. Behaviors that hadbeen considered typically masculine or feminine inthe past may now be generally accepted in membersof both genders. Words such as \"unisex\" communicatea desire by some individuals to diminish the distinc-tion between genders and minimize the discrimina-tion of either. Gender roles are changing as bothwomen and men enter professions that were oncedominated by members of the opposite gender. Age or Developmental Level Age influences communication and it is never more evident than during adolescence. In their struggle toseparate from parental confines and establish their own identity, adolescents generate a unique pattern of communication that changes from generation togeneration. Words such as dude, groovy, clueless , awesome, cool, and wasted have had special meaning for certain generations of adolescents. The technological age hasproduced a whole new language for today's adolescents.Communication by text (\"mom shoulder\"). Developmental influences on communication may relate to physiological alterations. One example isAmerican Sign Language, the system of unique ges-tures used by many people who are deaf or hearingimpaired. Individuals who are blind at birth neverlearn the subtle nonverbal gesticulations that accom-pany language and can totally change the meaning ofthe spoken word. Environment in Which the Transaction Takes Place The place where the communication occurs influ- ences the outcome of the interaction. Some individ-uals who feel uncomfortable and refuse to speakduring a group therapy session may be open and will-ing to discuss problems privately on a one-to-one basiswith the nurse. Territoriality, density, and distance are aspects of environment that communicate messages. Territorial- ityis the innate tendency to own space. Individuals lay claim to areas around them as their own. This influ-ences communication when an interaction takesplace in the territory \"owned\" by one or the other. In-terpersonal communication can be more successfulif the interaction takes place in a \"neutral\" area. Forexample, with the concept of territoriality in mind,the nurse may choose to conduct the psychosocial as-sessment in an interview room rather than in his orher office or in the client's room. Density refers to the number of people within a given environmental space. It has been shown to influenceinterpersonal interaction. Some studies indicate that acorrelation exists between prolonged high-density sit-uations and certain behaviors, such as aggression,stress, criminal activity, hostility toward others, and adeterioration of mental and physical health.CHAPTER 8 Therapeutic Communication 1374092_Ch08_135-149 24/07/14 6:05 PM Page 137Distance is the means by which various cultures use space to communicate. Hall (1966) identified four kinds of spatial interaction, or distances, thatpeople maintain from each other in their interper-sonal interactions and the kinds of activities inwhich people engage at these various distances. Intimate distance is the closest distance that individ- uals will allow between themselves and others. Inthe United States, this distance, which is restrictedto interactions of an intimate nature, is 0 to 18 inches. Personal distance is approximately 18 to 40 inches and reserved for interactions that are per-sonal in nature, such as close conversations withfriends or colleagues. Social distance is about 4 to 12 feet away from the body. Interactions at this dis-tance include conversations with strangers or ac-quaintances, such as at a cocktail party or in a publicbuilding. A public distance is one that exceeds 12 feet. Examples include speaking in public oryelling to someone some distance away. This distanceis considered public space, and communicants arefree to move about in it during the interaction. Nonverbal Communication It has been estimated that about 70 to 80 percent ofall effective communication is nonverbal (Khan,2009). Some aspects of nonverbal expression havebeen discussed in the previous section on preexistingconditions that influence communication. Othercomponents of nonverbal communication includephysical appearance and dress, body movement andposture, touch, facial expressions, eye behavior, andvocal cues or paralanguage. These nonverbal mes-sages vary from culture to culture. Physical Appearance and Dress Physical appearance and dress are part of the total non-verbal stimuli that influence interpersonal responsesand, under some conditions, they are the primary determinants of such responses. Body coverings\u2014bothdress and hair\u2014are manipulated by the wearer in amanner that conveys a distinct message to the receiver.Dress can be formal or casual, stylish or unkempt. Haircan be long or short, and even the presence or absenceof hair conveys a message about the person. Other bodyadornments that are also considered potential commu-nicative stimuli include tattoos, masks, cosmetics,badges, jewelry, and eyeglasses. Some jewelry worn inspecific ways can give special messages (e.g., a gold bandor diamond ring worn on the third finger of the lefthand, a pin bearing Greek letters worn on the lapel, orthe wearing of a ring that is inscribed with the insigniaof a college or university). Some individuals convey aspecific message with the total absence of any type ofbody adornment.Body Movement and Posture The way in which an individual positions his or her bodycommunicates messages regarding self-esteem, genderidentity, status, and interpersonal warmth or coldness.The individual whose posture is slumped, with head andeyes pointed downward, conveys a message of low self-esteem. Specific ways of standing or sitting are consid-ered to be either feminine or masculine within a definedculture. In the United States, to stand straight and tallwith head high and hands on hips indicates a superiorstatus over the person being addressed. Reece and Whitman (1962) identified response be- haviors that were used to designate individuals as ei-ther \"warm\" or \"cold\" persons. Individuals who wereperceived as warm responded to others with a shift ofposture toward the other person, a smile, direct eyecontact, and hands that remained still. Individualswho responded to others with a slumped posture, bylooking around the room, drumming fingers on thedesk, and not smiling were perceived as cold. Touch Touch is a powerful communication tool. It can elicitboth negative and positive reactions, depending onthe people involved and the circumstances of the in-teraction. It is a very basic and primitive form of com-munication, and the appropriateness of its use isculturally determined. Touch can be categorized according to the mes- sage communicated (Knapp & Hall, 2010): Functional- Professional. This type of touch is im- personal and businesslike. It is used to accomplisha task. EXAMPLE A tailor measuring a customer for a suit or a physician exam- ining a client. Social- Polite. This type of touch is still rather im- personal, but it conveys an affirmation or accept- ance of the other person. EXAMPLE A handshake. Friendship -Warmth. Touch at this level indicates a strong liking for the other person, a feeling that heor she is a friend. EXAMPLE Laying one's hand on the shoulder of another. Love -Intimacy. This type of touch conveys an emo- tional attachment or attraction for another person. EXAMPLE Engaging in a strong, mutual embrace.138 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch08_135-149 24/07/14 6:05 PM Page 138Sexual Arousal. Touch at this level is an expression of physical attraction only. EXAMPLE Touching another in the genital region. Some cultures encourage more touching of vari- ous types than others. \"Contact cultures\" (e.g., France, Latin America, Italy) use a greater frequencyof touch cues than do those in \"noncontact cultures\"(e.g., Germany, United States, Canada) (Givens,2010a). The nurse should understand the culturalmeaning of touch before using this method of com-munication in specific situations. Facial Expressions Next to human speech, facial expression is the pri-mary source of communication. Facial expressionsprimarily reveal an individual's emotional states,such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and fear.The face is a complex multimessage system. Facialexpressions serve to complement and qualify othercommunication behaviors, and at times even takethe place of verbal messages. A summary of feelingsassociated with various facial expressions is pre-sented in Table 8-1. Eye Behavior Eyes have been called the \"windows of the soul.\" Itis through eye contact that individuals view and areviewed by others in a revealing way. An interper-sonal connectedness occurs through eye contact. InAmerican culture, eye contact conveys a personal in-terest in the other person. Eye contact indicates thatthe communication channel is open, and it is oftenthe initiating factor in verbal interaction betweentwo people. Eye behavior is regulated by social rules. These rules dictate where, when, for how long, and at whomwe can look. Staring is often used to register disap-proval of the behavior of another. People are ex-tremely sensitive to being looked at, and if the gazingor staring behavior violates social rules, they often as-sign meaning to it, such as the following statementimplies: \"He kept staring at me, and I began to won-der if I was dressed inappropriately or had mustardon my face!\" Gazing at another's eyes arouses strong emotions. Thus, eye contact rarely lasts longer than 3 secondsbefore one or both viewers experience a powerfulurge to glance away. Breaking eye contact lowersstress levels (Givens, 2010c). Vocal Cues or Paralanguage Paralanguage is the gestural component of the spo- ken word. It consists of pitch, tone, and loudness ofCHAPTER 8 Therapeutic Communication 139 TABLE 8-1 Summary of Facial Expressions FACIAL EXPRESSION ASSOCIATED FEELINGS Narrowed; lids squeezed shut StareStare/blink/look awayEyes downcast; lack of eye contact Eye contact (generally intermittent, as opposed to a stare) SOURCES: Adapted from Givens (2010b); the rate speaking; expressively placed pauses; and emphasis assigned to certainwords. These vocal cues greatly influence the wayindividuals interpret verbal messages. A normallysoft-spoken individual whose pitch and rate ofspeaking increases may be perceived as being anx-ious or tense. Different vocal emphases can alter interpretation of the message. Three examples follow: 1.\"I felt SURE you would notice the change.\" Interpretation :I was SURE you would, but you didn't.4092_Ch08_135-149 24/07/14 6:05 PM Page 1392.\"I felt sure YOU would notice the change.\" Interpretation: I thought YOU would, even if no- body else did. 3.\"I felt sure you would notice the CHANGE.\" Interpretation :Even if you didn't notice anything else, I thought you would notice the CHANGE. Ve rbal cues play a major role in determining re- sponses in human communication situations. How a message is verbalized can be as important as what is verbalized.Therapeutic Communication Techniques Hays and Larson (1963) identified a number of techniques to assist the nurse in interacting moretherapeutically with clients. These are important\"technical procedures\" carried out by the nurseworking in psychiatry, and they should serve to enhance development of a therapeutic nurse-clientrelationship. Table 8-2 includes a list of these tech-niques, a short explanation of their usefulness, andexamples of each. Nontherapeutic Communication Techniques Several approaches are considered to be barriers toopen communication between the nurse and client.Hays and Larson (1963) identified a number of thesetechniques, which are presented in Table 8-3. Nursesshould recognize and eliminate the use of these patterns in their relationships with clients. Avoidingthese communication barriers will maximize the 140 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care CORE CONCEPT Therapeutic Communication Caregiver verbal and nonverbal techniques that focus on the care receiver's needs and advance the promo-tion of healing and change.

Making oneself available on an uncon- ditional basis, increasing client's feel-ings of self-worth. Allows the client to take the initiative in introducing the topic; emphasizesthe importance of the client's role inthe interaction. Offers the client encouragement to continue. Clarifies the relationship of events in time so that the nurse and client canview them in perspective. Verbalizing what is observed or per- ceived.

Would you please explain?\" \"Tell me if my understanding agrees with yours.\" \"Do I understand correctly that you said . . .?\" \"I understand that the voices seem real to you, but I do not hear any voices.\" \"There is no one else in the room but you and me.\"Asking the client to verbalize what is being perceived; often used with clients experiencing hallucinations. Asking the client to compare similari- ties and differences in ideas, experi-ences, or interpersonal relationships.This helps the client recognize life experiences that tend to recur aswell as those aspects of life that arechangeable. Repeating the main idea of what the client has said. This lets the clientknow whether or not an expressedstatement has been understood andgives him or her the chance to con-tinue, or to clarify if necessary. Questions and feelings are referred back to the client so that they maybe recognized and accepted, and sothat the client may recognize that hisor her point of view has value\u2014agood technique to use when theclient asks the nurse for advice. Taking notice of a single idea or even a single word; works especially wellwith a client who is moving rapidlyfrom one thought to another. Thistechnique is nottherapeutic, how- ever, with the client who is veryanxious. Focusing should not bepursued until the anxiety level hassubsided. Delving further into a subject, idea, experience, or relationship; especiallyhelpful with clients who tend to re-main on a superficial level of com-munication. However, if the clientchooses not to disclose further infor-mation, the nurse should refrainfrom pushing or probing in an areathat obviously creates discomfort. Striving to explain that which is vague or incomprehensible and searchingfor mutual understanding. Clarifyingthe meaning of what has been saidfacilitates and increases understand-ing for both client and nurse. When the client has a misperception of the environment, the nurse de-fines reality or indicates his or herperception of the situation for theclient.4092_Ch08_135-149 24/07/14 6:05 PM Page 141142 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care TABLE 8-2 Therapeutic Communication Techniques\u2014cont'd TECHNIQUE EXPLANATION/RATIONALE EXAMPLES Voicing doubt Ve rbalizing the implied Attempting to translate words into feelings Formulating a plan of action SOURCE: Adapted from Hays & Larson (1963).

I'm glad that you say: \"Let's talk about how your behavior invoked anger in the otherclients at dinner.\"Indicates to the client that there is no cause for anxiety, thereby devaluingthe client's feelings; may discouragethe client from further expression offeelings if he or she believes theywill only be downplayed orridiculed. Refusing to consider or showing contempt for the client's ideas or behavior. This may cause theclient to discontinue interactionwith the nurse for fear of further rejection. Sanctioning or denouncing the client's ideas or behavior; implies that thenurse has the right to pass judgmenton whether the client's ideas or behaviors are \"good\" or \"bad,\" andthat the client is expected to pleasethe nurse. The nurse's acceptance of the client is then seen as condi-tional depending on the client's behavior.\"I understand that you believe that to be true, but I see the situation differently.\" \"I find that hard to believe (or accept).\"\"That seems rather doubtful to me.\" Cl: \"It's a waste of time to be here. I can't talk to you or anyone.\" Ns: \"Are you feeling that no one understands?\" Cl: (Mute) Ns: \"It must have been very difficult for you when your husband died in the fire.\" Cl: \"I'm way out in the ocean.\"Ns: \"You must be feeling very lonely right now.\" \"What could you do to let your anger out harmlessly?\" \"Next time this comes up, what might you do to handle it more appropriately?\"Expressing uncertainty as to the reality of the client's perceptions; oftenused with clients experiencing delu-sional thinking. Putting into words what the client has only implied or said indirectly; canalso be used with the client who ismute or is otherwise experiencingimpaired verbal communication. Thisclarifies that which is implicit rather than explicit. When feelings are expressed indi- rectly, the nurse tries to \"desymbol-ize\" what has been said and to find clues to the underlying true feelings. When a client has a plan in mind for dealing with what is consideredto be a stressful situation, it mayserve to prevent anger or anxietyfrom escalating to an unmanage-able level.4092_Ch08_135-149 24/07/14 6:05 PM Page 8 8-3 Nontherapeutic Communication Techniques\u2014cont'd TECHNIQUE EXPLANATION/RATIONALE EXAMPLES ContinuedAgreeing or disagreeing Giving advice Probing Defending Requesting an explanation Indicating the existence of an external source of power\"That's right.

Disagreement implies inaccuracy, provoking the need fordefensiveness on the part of theclient. Telling the client what to do or how to behave implies that the nurse knowswhat is best and that the client is in-capable of any self-direction. It nur-tures the client in the dependent role by discouraging independentthinking. Persistent questioning of the client; pushing for answers to issues theclient does not wish to discuss. Thiscauses the client to feel used andvalued only for what is shared withthe nurse and places the client onthe defensive. Attempting to protect someone or something from verbal attack. To defend what the client has criticizedis to imply that he or she has noright to express ideas, opinions, orfeelings. Defending does not changethe client's feelings and may causethe client to think the nurse is takingsides against the client. Asking the client to provide the rea- sons for thoughts, feelings, behavior,and events. Asking \"why\" a client didsomething or feels a certain way canbe very intimidating, and implies thatthe client must defend his or her be-havior or feelings. Attributing the source of thoughts, feelings, and behavior to others orto outside influences. This encour-ages the client to project blame forhis or her thoughts or behaviors onothers rather than accepting the responsibility personally.4092_Ch08_135-149 24/07/14 6:05 PM Page 143144 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care SOURCE: Adapted from Hays & Larson (1963).TABLE 8-3 Nontherapeutic Communication Techniques\u2014cont'd TECHNIQUE EXPLANATION/RATIONALE EXAMPLES Belittling feelings expressed Making stereotyped comments Using denial Interpreting Introducing an unrelated topicCl: \"I have nothing to live for.

The nurse has notbeen prepared to perform this tech-nique, and in attempting to do so, may endanger other nursing roles withthe client. Cl: \"I don't have anything to live for.\"Ns: \"Did you have visitors this weekend?\"Better technique: The nurse must remain open and free to hear the client and totake in all that is being conveyed, both verbally and nonverbally.When the nurse misjudges the de- gree of the client's discomfort, alack of empathy and understandingmay be conveyed. The nurse maytell the client to \"perk up\" or \"snapout of it.\" This causes the client tofeel insignificant or unimportant.When one is experiencing discom-fort, it is no relief to hear that oth-ers are or have been in similarsituations. Clich\u00e9s and trite expressions are meaningless in a nurse-client rela-tionship. When the nurse makesempty conversation, it encourages alike response from the client. Denying that a problem exists blocks discussion with the client and avoidshelping the client identify and ex-plore areas of difficulty. With this technique the therapist seeks to make conscious that which is un-conscious, to tell the client themeaning of his or her experience. Changing the subject causes the nurse to take over the direction of the discussion. This may occur in order to get to something thatthe nurse wants to discuss with the client or to get away from atopic that he or she would prefernot to discuss. effectiveness of communication and enhance the nurse-client relationship. Active Listening To listen actively is to be attentive to what the client issaying, both verbally and nonverbally. Attentive listen-ing creates a climate in which the client can communi-cate. With active listening the nurse communicatesacceptance and respect for the client, and trust is en-hanced. A climate is established within the relationshipthat promotes openness and honest expression.Several nonverbal behaviors have been designated as facilitative skills for attentive listening. Those listedhere can be identified by the acronym SOLER: S\u2014Sit squarely facing the client. This gives the mes- sage that the nurse is there to listen and is inter- ested in what the client has to say. O\u2014Observe an open posture. Posture is considered \"open\" when arms and legs remain uncrossed.This suggests that the nurse is \"open\" to what theclient has to say. With a \"closed\" position, the nursecan convey a somewhat defensive stance, possiblyinvoking a similar response in the client.4092_Ch08_135-149 24/07/14 6:05 PM Page 144L\u2014Lean forward toward the client. This conveys to the client that you are involved in the interaction, interested in what is being said, and making a sin-cere effort to be attentive. E\u2014Establish eye contact. Eye contact, intermittently directed, is another behavior that conveys the nurse'sinvolvement and willingness to listen to what theclient has to say. The absence of eye contact or theconstant shifting of eye contact elsewhere in the environment gives the message that the nurse is notreally interested in what is being said. CLINICAL PEARL Ensure that eye contact conveys warmth and is accompanied by smiling and intermittent nodding of the head,and does not come across as staring or glaring, which can create intense discomfort in the client. R\u2014Relax. Whether sitting or standing during the in- teraction, the nurse should communicate a sense of being relaxed and comfortable with the client.Restlessness and fidgetiness communicate a lack ofinterest and may convey a feeling of discomfortthat is likely to be transferred to the client.Process Recordings Process recordings are written reports of verbal interactions with clients. They are verbatim (to theextent that this is possible) accounts, written by thenurse or student as a tool for improving interper-sonal communication techniques. The processrecording can take many forms, but usually includesthe verbal and nonverbal communication of bothnurse and client. The exercise provides a means for the nurse to analyze both the content and the pat-tern of the interaction. The process recording, whichis not considered documentation, is intended to beused as a learning tool for professional development.An example of one type of process recording is pre-sented in Table 8-4. Feedback Feedback is a method of communication for help-ing the client consider a modification of behavior.Feedback gives information to clients about howthey are being perceived by others. It should be pre-sented in a manner that discourages defensivenessCHAPTER 8 Therapeutic Communication 145 TABLE 8-4 Sample Process Recording NURSE'S THOUGHTS AND NURSE VERBAL CLIENT VERBAL FEELINGS CONCERNING ANAL YSIS OF THE (NONVERBAL) (NONVERBAL) THE INTERACTION INTERACTION Do you still have thoughts about harming yourself?

Feedback can be useful to the client if presented with objectivity by a trustedindividual. Some criteria about useful feedback include the following: Feedback is descriptive rather than evaluative andfocuses on the behavior rather than on the client.Avoiding evaluative language reduces the need forthe client to react defensively. Objective descrip-tions allow clients to take the information and useit in whatever way they choose. When the focus ison the client, the nurse makes judgments aboutthe client. EXAMPLE Descriptive and \"Jane was very upset in group today on behavior when you called her 'fatty' and laughed at her in front of the others.\" Evaluative \"You were very rude and inconsiderate to Jane in group today.\" Focus on client \"You are a very insensitive person.\" Feedback should be specific rather than general.Information that gives details about the client's behavior can be used more easily than a general-ized description for modifying the behavior. EXAMPLE Specific \"You were talking to Joe when we were deciding on the issue. Now you want to argue about the outcome.\" General \"You just don't pay attention.\" Feedback should be directed toward behavior that the client has the capacity to modify. To provide feedback about a characteristic or situa-tion that the client cannot change only provokesfrustration.

Giving advice fosters dependenceYes, I can understand that you would like things to be the way they were before. (Offer client a tissue.) What do you think are the chances of your getting back together? (SOLER) So how are you preparing to deal with this inevitable outcome? (SOLER) It won't be easy. But you have come a long way, and I feel you have gained strength in your ability to cope. (Standing. Looking at client. Smiling.)Therapeutic. Conveying empathy. Therapeutic. Reflecting.

It is theclient's right and privilege to be as self-sufficientas possible. EXAMPLE Imparting information \"Ther e are various methods of assistance for people who want to lose weight, such as OvereatersAnonymous, Weight Watchers,regular visits to a dietitian, and thePhysician's Weight Loss Program.You can decide what is best for you.\" Giving advice \"You obviously need to lose a great deal of weight. I think thePhysician's Weight Loss Programwould be best for you.\" Feedback should be well timed. Feedback is most useful when given at the earliest appropriate op-portunity following the specific behavior. EXAMPLE Prompt response \"I saw you hit the wall with your fist just now when you hung up the phone after talking to your mother.\" Delayed response \"Y ou need to learn some more appropriate ways of dealing with youranger. Last week after group I sawyou pounding your fist against the wall.\" Summary and Key Points Interpersonal communication is a transaction be- tween the sender and the receiver. In all interpersonal transactions, both the senderand receiver bring certain preexisting conditionsto the exchange that influence both the intendedmessage and the way in which it is interpreted.Examples of these preexisting conditions includeone's value system, internalized attitudes and be-liefs, culture or religion, social status, gender,background knowledge and experience, age ordevelopmental level, and the type of environmentin which the communication takes place. Nonverbal expression is a primary communicationsystem in which meaning is assigned to various ges-tures and patterns of behavior. Some components of nonverbal communicationinclude physical appearance and dress, body move-ment and posture, touch, facial expressions, eye be-havior, and vocal cues or paralanguage. Meaning of the nonverbal components of commu-nication is culturally determined. Therapeutic communication includes verbal andnonverbal techniques that focus on the care re-ceiver's needs and advance the promotion of heal-ing and change. Nurses must also be aware of and avoid a numberof techniques that are considered to be barriers toeffective communication. Active listening is described as being attentive to whatthe client is saying, through both verbal and nonver-bal cues. Skills associated with active listening includesitting squarely facing the client, observing an openposture, leaning forward toward the client, establish-ing eye contact, and being relaxed. Process recordings are written reports of verbal in-teractions with clients. They are used as learningtools for professional development. Feedback is a method of communication for help-ing the client consider a modification of behavior. The nurse must be aware of the therapeutic ornontherapeutic value of the communication tech-niques used with the client because they are the\"tools\" of psychosocial intervention.CHAPTER 8 Therapeutic Communication 147 Additional info available at www.davisplus.com4092_Ch08_135-149 24/07/14 6:05 PM Page 147148 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

It is nursing's means of fulfilling the require-ment for a scientific methodology in order to be con- sidered a profession. This chapter examines the steps of the nursing process as they are set forth by the American NursesAssociation (ANA) in Nursing: Scope and Standards ofPractice (ANA, 2010a). An explanation is provided for the implementation of case management andthe tool used in the delivery of care with thismethodology, critical pathways of care. A descrip-tion of concept mapping is included, and documen-tation that validates the use of the nursing processis discussed. The Nursing Process Definition The nursing process consists of six steps and uses aproblem-solving approach that has come to be ac-cepted as nursing's scientific methodology. It is goal-directed, with the objective being delivery of qualityclient care. The nursing process is dynamic, not static. It is an ongoing process that continues for as long as thenurse and client have interactions directed towardchange in the client's physical or behavioral re-sponses. Figure 9-1 presents a schematic of the ongo-ing nursing process.Standards of Practice The ANA, in collaboration with the American Psychi-atric Nurses Association (APNA) and the Interna-tional Society of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurses(ISPN), has delineated a set of standards that psychi-atric nurses are expected to follow as they providecare for their clients. The ANA (2010a) states: The Standards of Practice describe a competent level of nursing care as demonstrated by the critical think-ing model known as the nursing process. The nursingprocess includes the components of assessment, di-agnosis, outcomes identification, planning, imple-mentation, and evaluation. Accordingly, the nursingprocess encompasses significant actions taken by reg-istered nurses, and forms the foundation of thenurse's decision-making. (p. 9) Following are the standards of practice for psychiatric/mental health nurses as set forth by the ANA, APNA, and ISPN (2007). FIGURE 9-1 The ongoing nursing process.CORE CONCEPT Assessment A systematic, dynamic process by which the regis- tered nurse, through interaction with the patient, family,groups, communities, populations, and health-careproviders, collects and analyzes data. Assessmentmay include the following dimensions: physical, psy-chological, sociocultural, spiritual, cognitive, functionalabilities, developmental, economic, and lifestyle (ANA,2010a, p. 63). Standard 1: Assessment The Psychiatric-Mental Health Registered Nurse collects comprehensive health data that is pertinent to the patient'shealth or situation. In this first step, information is gathered from which to establish a database for determining thebest possible care for the client. Information for thisdatabase is gathered from a variety of sources in-cluding interviews with the client or family, obser-vation of the client and his or her environment,consultation with other health-team members, re-view of the client's records, and a nursing physicalexamination. A biopsychosocial assessment toolbased on the stress-adaptation framework is in-cluded in Box 9-1. An example of a simple and quick mental status evaluation is presented in Table 9-1.

A nursing diagnosis providesthe basis for selection of nursing interventions to achieveoutcomes for which the nurse has accountability.(NANDA, 2012). 4092_Ch09_150-173 24/07/14 5:24 PM Page 158Standard 2: Diagnosis The Psychiatric-Mental Health Registered Nurse analyzes the assessment data to determine diagnoses or problems, includ-ing level of risk. In the second step, data gathered during the assess- ment are analyzed. Diagnoses and potential problemstatements are formulated and prioritized. Diagnosesare congruent with available and accepted classifica-tion systems (e.g., NANDA Nursing Di-agnosis Classification [see Appendix E]).based on current psychiatric/mental health nursingpractice and research, are selected. Client educationand necessary referrals are included. Priorities for deliv-ery of nursing care are determined. Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) NIC is a comprehensive, standardized language de-scribing treatments that nurses perform in all set-tings and in all specialties. NIC includes bothphysiological and psychosocial interventions, as wellas those for illness treatment, illness prevention,and health promotion. NIC interventions are com-prehensive, based on research, and reflect currentclinical practice. They were developed inductivelybased on existing practice. Each NIC intervention has a definition and a de- tailed set of activities that describe what a nurse doesto implement the intervention. The use of a standard-ized language is thought to enhance continuity ofcare and facilitate communication among nurses andbetween nurses and other providers. Standard 5: Implementation The Psychiatric-Mental Health Registered Nurse implementsthe identified plan. Interventions selected during the planning stage are executed, taking into consideration the nurse'slevel of practice, education, and certification. Thecare plan serves as a blueprint for delivery of safe, eth-ical, and appropriate interventions. Documentationof interventions also occurs at this step in the nursingprocess. Several specific interventions are included among the standards of psychiatric/mental health clinicalnursing practice (ANA, APNA, & ISPN, 2007): Standard 5A: Coordination of Care The Psychiatric-Mental Health Registered Nurse coordinatescare delivery. Standard 5B: Health Teaching and Health Promotion The Psychiatric-Mental Health Registered Nurse employs strategies to promote health and a safe environment. Standard 5C: Milieu Therapy The Psychiatric-Mental Health Registered Nurse provides,structures, and maintains a safe and therapeutic environ-ment in collaboration with patients, families, and otherhealthcare clinicians. Standard 5D: Pharmacological, Biological, and Integrative Therapies The Psychiatric-Mental Health Registered Nurse incorporates knowledge of pharmacological, biological, and complemen-tary interventions with applied clinical skills to restore thepatient's health and prevent further disability.CHAPTER 9 The Nursing Process in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing 159 CORE CONCEPT Outcomes End results that are measurable, desirable, and observ- able, and translate into observable behaviors (ANA,2010a, p. 65). Standard 3: Outcomes Identification The Psychiatric-Mental Health Registered Nurse identifies expected outcomes for a plan individualized to the patient orto the situation. Expected outcomes are derived from the diagno- sis. They must be measurable and include a time esti-mate for attainment. They must be realistic for theclient's capabilities, and are most effective when for-mulated cooperatively by the interdisciplinary teammembers, the client, and significant others. Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) The Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) is a com- prehensive, standardized classification of patient/clientoutcomes developed to evaluate the effects of nursinginterventions (Moorhead, Johnson, Maas, & Swanson,2013). The outcomes have been linked to NANDA In-ternational diagnoses and to the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC). NANDA-I, NIC, and NOC repre- sent all domains of nursing and can be used togetheror separately (Moorhead & Dochterman, 2012). Eachof the NOC outcomes has a label name, a definition, alist of indicators to evaluate client status in relation tothe outcome, and a five-point Likert scale to measureclient status (Moorhead et al., 2013). Standard 4: Planning The Psychiatric-Mental Health Registered Nurse develops aplan that prescribes strategies and alternatives to attain ex-pected outcomes. The care plan is individualized to the client's mental health problems, condition, or needs and is developedin collaboration with the client, significant others, andinterdisciplinary team members, if possible. For each di-agnosis identified, the most appropriate interventions,4092_Ch09_150-173 24/07/14 5:24 PM Page 159Standard 5E: Prescriptive Authority and Treatment The Psychiatric-Mental Health Advanced Practice Registered Nurse uses prescriptive authority, procedures, referrals, treat-ments, and therapies in accordance with state and federallaws and regulations. Standard 5F: Psychotherapy The Psychiatric-Mental Health Advanced Practice RegisteredNurse conducts individual, couples, group, and family psy-chotherapy using evidence-based psychotherapeutic frame-works and nurse-patient therapeutic relationships. Standard 5G: Consultation The Psychiatric-Mental Health Advanced Practice RegisteredNurse provides consultation to influence the identified plan,enhance the abilities of other clinicians to provide services forpatients, and effect change.documented, validating use of the nursing processin the delivery of care. The diagnoses, outcomes,and plan of care are reviewed and revised as needis determined by the evaluation. Why Nursing Diagnosis? The concept of nursing diagnosis is not new. For cen-turies, nurses have identified specific client responsesfor which nursing interventions were used in an effortto improve quality of life. Historically, however, theautonomy of practice to which nurses were entitledby virtue of their licensure was lacking in the provi-sion of nursing care. Nurses assisted physicians as re-quired, and performed a group of specific tasks thatwere considered within their scope of responsibility. The term diagnosis in relation to nursing first began to appear in the literature in the early 1950s.The formalized organization of the concept, however,was initiated only in 1973 with the convening of theFirst Task Force to Name and Classify Nursing Diag-noses. The Task Force of the National ConferenceGroup on the Classification of Nursing Diagnoses wasdeveloped during this conference. These individualswere charged with the task of identifying and classify-ing nursing diagnoses. Also in the 1970s, the ANA began to write stan- dards of practice around the steps of the nursingprocess, of which nursing diagnosis is an inherentpart. This format encompassed both the general andspecialty standards outlined by the ANA. The stan-dards of psychiatric/mental health nursing practiceare summarized in Box 9-2.160 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care CORE CONCEPT Evaluation The process of determining the progress toward attain- ment of expected outcomes, including the effectivenessof care (ANA, 2010a, p. 65). Standard 6: Evaluation The Psychiatric-Mental Health Registered Nurse evaluates progress toward attainment of expected outcomes. During the evaluation step, the nurse measures the success of the interventions in meeting the out-come criteria.

The ANA defined nursing as \"the diagnosis andtreatment of human responses to actual or potentialhealth problems\" (ANA, 2010b). This definition hasbeen expanded to describe more appropriately nurs-ing's commitment to society and to the profession it-self. The ANA (2010b) defines nursing as follows: Nursing is the protection, promotion, and optimiza- tion of health and abilities, prevention of illness andinjury, alleviation of suffering through the diagnosisand treatment of human response, and advocacy inthe care of individuals, families, communities, andpopulations. (p. 10) Nursing diagnosis is an inherent component of both the original and expanded definitions. Decisions regarding professional negligence are made based on the standards of practice defined by the ANA and the individual state nursing practiceacts. A number of states have incorporated the stepsof the nursing process, including nursing diagnosis,into the scope of nursing practice described in theirnursing practice acts. When this is the case, it is thelegal duty of the nurse to show that nursing processand nursing diagnosis were accurately implementedin the delivery of nursing care. NANDA International (NANDA-I) evolved from the original task force that was convened in 1973 toname and classify nursing diagnoses. The major pur-pose of NANDA-I is to \"to develop, refine and promoteterminology that accurately reflects nurses' clinicaljudgments. NANDA-I will be a global force for the development and use of nursing's standardized termi-nology to ensure patient safety through evidence-basedcare, thereby improving the health care of all people\"(NANDA-I, 2013). A list of nursing diagnoses ap-proved by NANDA-I for use and testing is presentedin Appendix E. This list is by no means exhaustive orall-inclusive. In an effort to maintain a common lan-guage within nursing and to encourage clinical testingof what is available, most of the nursing diagnosesused in this text will come from the 2012-2014 list approved by NANDA-I. However, in a few instances,nursing diagnoses that have been retired by NANDA-I for various reasons will continue to be used becauseof their appropriateness and suitability in describingspecific behaviors. The use of nursing diagnosis affords a degree of au- tonomy that historically has been lacking in the prac-tice of nursing. Nursing diagnosis describes the client'scondition, facilitating the prescription of interventionsand establishment of parameters for outcome criteriabased on what is uniquely nursing. The ultimate ben-efit is to the client, who receives effective and consistentnursing care based on knowledge of the problems thathe or she is experiencing and of the most beneficialnursing interventions to resolve them. Nursing Case Management The concept of case management evolved with the ad- vent of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) and shorterhospital stays. Case management is an innovativemodel of care delivery that can result in improvedclient care. Within this model, clients are assigned amanager who negotiates with multiple providers toobtain diverse services. This type of health-care deliv-ery process serves to decrease fragmentation of carewhile striving to contain cost of services. Case management in the acute care setting strives to organize client care through an episode of illnessso that specific clinical and financial outcomes areachieved within an allotted time frame. Commonly,the allotted time frame is determined by the estab-lished protocols for length of stay as defined by the DRGs. Case management has been shown to be an effec- tive method of treatment for individuals with a severeand persistent mental illness. This type of care strivesto improve functioning by assisting the individual tosolve problems, improve work and socialization skills,promote leisure-time activities, and enhance overallindependence.CHAPTER 9 The Nursing Process in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing 161 BOX 9-2 Standards of Psychiatric-Mental Health Clinical Nursing Practice\u2014cont'd Standard 5E.

Various definitions have emerged andshould be clarified, as follows. Managed care refers to a strategy employed by pur- chasers of health services who make determinationsabout various types of services in order to maintainquality and control costs. In a managed care program,individuals receive health care based on need, as as-sessed by coordinators of the providership. Managedcare exists in many settings, including (but not lim-ited to) the following: Insurance-based programs Employer-based medical providerships Social service programs The public health sector Managed care may exist in virtually any setting in which medical providership is a part of the service;that is, in any setting in which an organization(whether private or government-based) is responsiblefor payment of health-care services for a group of peo-ple. Examples of managed care are health mainte-nance organizations (HMOs) and preferred providerorganizations (PPOs). Case management is the method used to achieve managed care. It is the actual coordination of servicesrequired to meet the needs of a client within the frag-mented health-care system. Case management strivesto help at-risk clients prevent avoidable episodes ofillness. Its goal is to provide these services while at-tempting to control health-care costs to the consumerand third-party payers. Types of clients who benefit from case manage- ment include (but are not limited to) the following: The frail elderly Individuals with developmental disabilities Individuals with physical disabilities Individuals with mental disabilities Individuals with long-term medically complexproblems that require multifaceted, costly care(e.g., high-risk infants, those with human immun-odeficiency virus [HIV] or acquired immunodefi-ciency syndrome [AIDS], and transplant clients) Individuals who are severely compromised by anacute episode of illness or an acute exacerbation ofa severe and persistent illness (e.g., schizophrenia) The case manager is responsible for negotiating with multiple health-care providers to obtain a vari-ety of services for the client. Nurses are exception-ally qualified to serve as case managers. The verynature of nursing, which incorporates knowledgeabout the biological, psychological, and sociocultu-ral aspects related to human functioning, makesnurses highly appropriate as case managers. Severalyears of experience as a registered nurse is usuallyrequired for employment as a case manager. Somecase management programs prefer advanced prac-tice registered nurses who have experience workingwith the specific populations for whom the casemanagement service will be rendered. The Ameri-can Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) offers anexamination for nurses to become board certifiedin nursing case management. Critical Pathways of Care Critical pathways of care (CPCs) may be used as the tools for provision of care in a case management sys-tem. A critical pathway is a type of abbreviated plan ofcare that provides outcome-based guidelines for goalachievement within a designated length of stay. A sam-ple CPC is presented in Table 9-2. Only one nursingdiagnosis is used in this sample. A CPC may have nurs-ing diagnoses for several individual problems. CPCs are intended to be used by the entire inter- disciplinary team, which may include a nurse casemanager, clinical nurse specialist, social worker, psy-chiatrist, psychologist, dietitian, occupational thera-pist, recreational therapist, chaplain, and others. Theteam decides what categories of care are to be per-formed, by what date, and by whom. Each member ofthe team is then expected to carry out his or her func-tions according to the time line designated on theCPC. The nurse, as case manager, is ultimately re-sponsible for ensuring that each of the assignmentsis carried out. If variations occur at any time in any ofthe categories of care, rationale must be documentedin the progress notes. For example, with the sample CPC presented, the nurse case manager may admit the client into thedetoxification center. The nurse contacts the psy-chiatrist to inform him or her of the admission. Thepsychiatrist performs additional assessments to de-termine if other consultations are required. Thepsychiatrist also writes the orders for the initial di-agnostic work-up and medication regimen. Within24 hours, the interdisciplinary team meets to decideon other categories of care, to complete the CPC,and to make individual care assignments from theCPC. This particular sample CPC relies heavily onnursing care of the client through the critical with-drawal period. However, other problems for thesame client, such as imbalanced nutrition, impairedphysical mobility, or spiritual distress, may involveother members of the team to a greater degree.Each member of the team stays in contact with thenurse case manager regarding individual assign-ments. Ideally, team meetings are held daily or everyother day to review progress and modify the plan as required.162 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch09_150-173 24/07/14 5:24 PM Page 162CHAPTER 9 The Nursing Process in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing 163TABLE 9-2 Sample Critical Pathway of Care for Client in Alcohol Withdrawal Estimated Length of Stay: 7 Days\u2014Variations from Designated Pathway Should Be Documented in Progress Notes NURSING DIAGNOSES AND C ATEGORIES TIME GOALS AND/ TIME GOALS AND/ TIME OF CARE DIMENSION OR ACTIONS DIMENSION OR ACTIONS DIMENSION DISCHARGE OUTCOME Risk for injury related to CNS agitation Referrals Diagnostic studies Additional assessments Medications Client education AA, Alcoholics Anonymous; bid, twice a day; DC, discontinue; hours; q8h, every 8 hours; VS, vital signs.Day 1 Day 1 Day 1 Day 1-5OngoingOngoing Day 1 Day 2Day 1-6Day 1-7PsychiatristAssess need for: bloodpressure, seizures, insomnia,hallucinations Librium* 200 mg in divided dosesLibrium 160 mg in divided dosesLibrium p.r.n.Maalox pc & hs*Note: Some physicians may elect to use Serax or Tegretol in thedetoxification processDay 4 Day 2-3 Day 6 Day 4 Day 3 Day 4 Day 5Repeat of selected diag- nostic studies as necessary VS q8h if stableDC I&O Marked decrease in objective withdrawal symptoms Librium 120 mg in divided doses Librium 80 mg in divided doses Discuss goals of AA and need for outpatienttherapyDay 7 Day 7 Day 4-7 Day 7 Day 5 Day 6Day 7 Day 7Client shows no evidence of injury obtained dur- ing ETOH withdrawal Discharge with follow- up appointments asrequired VS bid; remain stable Discharge; absence of objective withdrawal symptoms Librium 40 mg Discontinue libriumDischarge; no with- drawal symptoms Discharge or outpatienttreatment4092_Ch09_150-173 24/07/14 5:24 PM Page 163CPCs can be standardized, as they are intended to be used with uncomplicated cases. A CPC can be viewed as protocol for various clients with problemsfor which a designated outcome can be predicted. Applying the Nursing Process in the Psychiatric Setting Based on the definition of mental health set forth in Chapter 2, the role of the nurse in psychiatry focuseson helping the client successfully adapt to stressorswithin the environment. Goals are directed towardchanges in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that areage appropriate and congruent with local and cul-tural norms. Therapy within the psychiatric setting is very often team, or interdisciplinary, oriented. Therefore, it isimportant to delineate nursing's involvement in thetreatment regimen. Nurses are indeed valuable mem-bers of the team. Having progressed beyond the roleof custodial caregiver in the psychiatric setting, nursesnow provide services that are defined within the scopeof nursing practice. Nursing diagnosis is helping todefine these nursing boundaries, providing the de-gree of autonomy and professionalism that has for solong been unrealized. For example, a newly admitted client with the med- ical diagnosis of schizophrenia may be demonstratingthe following behaviors: Inability to trust others Verbalizing hearing voices Refusing to interact with staff and peers Expressing a fear of failure Poor personal hygiene From these assessments, the treatment team may determine that the client has the following problems: Paranoid delusions Auditory hallucinations Social withdrawal Developmental regression Team goals would be directed toward the following: Reducing suspiciousness Terminating auditory hallucinations Increasing feelings of self-worth From this team treatment plan, nursing may iden- tify the following nursing diagnoses: Disturbed sensory perception,* auditory hearing voices) Disturbed thought processes* (evidenced by delusions)Low self-esteem (evidenced by fear of failure andsocial withdrawal) Self-care deficit (evidenced by poor personal hygiene) Nursing diagnoses are prioritized according to life- threatening potential. Maslow's hierarchy of needs isa good model to follow in prioritizing nursing diag-noses. In this instance, disturbed sensory perception(auditory) is identified as the priority nursing diagno-sis, because the client may be hearing voices that com-mand him or her to harm self or others. Psychiatricnursing, regardless of the setting\u2014hospital (inpatientor outpatient), office, home, community\u2014is goal-directed care. The goals (or expected outcomes) areclient oriented, are measurable, and focus on resolu-tion of the problem (if this is realistic) or on a moreshort-term outcome (if resolution is unrealistic). Forexample, in the previous situation, expected out-comes for the identified nursing diagnoses might beas follows: The client will: Demonstrate trust in one staff member within 3 days. Verbalize understanding that the voices are notreal (not heard by others) within 5 days. Complete one simple craft project within 5 days. Take responsibility for own self-care and performactivities of daily living independently by time ofdischarge. Nursing's contribution to the interdisciplinary treatment regimen will focus on establishing truston a one-to-one basis (thus reducing the level of anx-iety that may be promoting hallucinations), givingpositive feedback for small day-to-day accomplish-ments in an effort to build self-esteem, and assistingwith and encouraging independent self-care. Theseinterventions describe independent nursing actions and goals that are evaluated apart from, while alsobeing directed toward achievement of, the team's treatment goals. In this manner of collaboration with other team members, nursing provides a service that is uniqueand based on sound knowledge of psychopathology,scope of practice, and legal implications of the role.Although there is no dispute that \"following doctor'sorders\" continues to be accepted as a priority of care,nursing intervention that enhances achievement ofthe overall goals of treatment is being recognized forits important contribution. The nurse who adminis-ters a medication prescribed by the physician to de-crease anxiety may also choose to stay with theanxious client and offer reassurance of safety and se-curity, thereby providing an independent nursing ac-tion that is distinct from, yet complementary to, themedical treatment.164 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care *Disturbed Sensory Perception and Disturbed Thought Processes have been resigned from the NANDA-I list of approved nursing diag- noses (NANDA-I, 2012). However, they will continue to be used in thistextbook because of their appropriateness to certain behaviors.4092_Ch09_150-173 24/07/14 5:24 PM Page 164Concept Mapping* Concept mapping is a diagrammatic teaching and learning strategy that allows students and faculty to vi- sualize interrelationships between medical diagnoses,nursing diagnoses, assessment data, and treatments.The concept map care plan is an innovative approachto planning and organizing nursing care. Basically, itis a diagram of client problems and interventions.Compared to the commonly used column formatcare plans, concept map care plans are more succinct.They are practical, realistic, and time saving, and theyserve to enhance critical-thinking skills and clinicalreasoning ability. The nursing process is foundational to developing and using the concept map care plan, just as it is withall types of nursing care plans. Client data are col-lected and analyzed, nursing diagnoses are formu-lated, outcome criteria are identified, nursing actionsare planned and implemented, and the success ofthe interventions in meeting the outcome criteria isevaluated. The concept map care plan may be presented in its entirety on one page, or the assessment data and nurs-ing diagnoses may appear in diagram format on onepage, with outcomes, interventions, and evaluationwritten on a second page. Alternatively, the diagrammay appear in circular format, with nursing diagnosesand interventions branching off the \"client\" in thecenter of the diagram. Or, it may begin with the\"client\" at the top of the diagram, with branches ema-nating in a linear fashion downward. As stated previously, the concept map care plan is based on the components of the nursing process. Ac-cordingly, the diagram is assembled in the nursingprocess stepwise fashion, beginning with the clientand his or her reason for needing care, nursing diag-noses with subjective and objective clinical evidencefor each, nursing interventions, and outcome criteriafor evaluation. Figure 9-2 presents one example of a concept map care plan. It is assembled for the hypotheticalclient with schizophrenia discussed in the previoussection, \"Applying the Nursing Process in the Psy-chiatric Setting.\" Different colors may be used inthe diagram to designate various components of thecare plan. Connecting lines are drawn betweencomponents to indicate any relationships that exist.For example, there may be a relationship betweentwo nursing diagnoses (e.g., between the nursing di-agnoses of pain or anxiety and disturbed sleep pat-tern). A line between these nursing diagnosesshould be drawn to show the relationship.Concept map care plans allow for a great deal of creativity on the part of the user, and permit viewingthe \"whole picture\" without generating a great dealof paperwork. Because they reflect the steps of thenursing process, concept map care plans also are valu-able guides for documentation of client care. Doenges,Moorhouse, & Murr (2010) have stated: As students, you are asked to develop plans of care that often contain more detail than what you see inthe hospital plans of care. This is to help you learnhow to apply the nursing process and create indi-vidualized client care plans. However, even thoughmuch time and energy may be spent focusing onfilling the columns of traditional clinical care planforms, some students never develop a holistic viewof their clients and fail to visualize how each clientneed interacts with other identified needs. A newtechnique or learning tool [concept mapping] hasbeen developed to assist you in visualizing the link-ages, to enhance your critical thinking skills, and tofacilitate the creative process of planning clientcare. (p. 32) Documentation of the Nursing Process Equally important as using the nursing process in the delivery of care is the written documentation that it hasbeen used. Some contemporary nursing leaders are ad-vocating that with solid standards of practice and pro-cedures in place within the institution, nurses need onlychart when there has been a deviation in the care asoutlined by that standard. This method of documenta-tion, known as charting by exception, is not widely ac-cepted, as many legal decisions are still based on theprecept that \"if it was not charted, it was not done.\" Because nursing process and nursing diagnosis are mandated by nursing practice acts in some states, doc-umentation of their use is being considered in thosestates as evidence in determining certain cases of neg-ligence by nurses. Some health-care organization ac-crediting agencies also require that nursing processbe reflected in the delivery of care. Therefore, docu-mentation must bear written testament to the use ofthe nursing process. A variety of documentation methods can be used to reflect use of the nursing process in the delivery ofnursing care. Three examples are presented here:problem-oriented recording (POR); Focus Charting \u00ae; and the problem, intervention, evaluation (PIE) sys-tem of documentation. Problem-Oriented Recording Problem-oriented recording follows the subjective, ob- jective, assessment, plan, implementation, and evalu-ation (SOAPIE) format. It has as its basis a list ofproblems. When it is used in nursing, the problemsCHAPTER 9 The Nursing Process in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing 165 *Content in this section is adapted from Doenges, Moorhouse, & Murr (2010) and Schuster (2012).4092_Ch09_150-173 24/07/14 5:24 PM Page 165166 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Clinical Vignette: Harry has been admitted to the psychiatric unit with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. He is socially isolated and stays in his room unless strongly encouraged by the nurse to come out. He says to the nurse, \"Y ouhave to be your own boss. Y ou can't trust anybody.\" He refuses to eat any food from his tray, stating that the voiceof his deceased grandfather is telling him it is poisoned. His clothes are dirty, and he has an objectionable bodyodor. The nurse develops the following concept map care plan for Harry.

Documentation written in theSOAPIE format includes the following: S= Subjective data: Information gathered from what the client, family, or other source has said or reported. O =Objective data: Information gathered through di- rect observation by the person performing the as-sessment; may include a physiological measurementsuch as blood pressure or a behavioral response suchas affect. A =Assessment: The nurse's interpretation of the sub- jective and objective data.P = Plan: The actions or treatments to be carried out (may be omitted in daily charting if the plan isclearly explained in the written nursing care planand no changes are expected). I =Intervention: Those nursing actions that were ac- tually carried out. E =Evaluation of the problem following nursing in- tervention (some nursing interventions cannot be evaluated immediately, so this section may beoptional). Table 9-3 shows how POR corresponds to the steps of the nursing process. Following is an example of a three-column docu- mentation in the POR format.CHAPTER 9 The Nursing Process in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing 167 EXAMPLE DATE/TIME PROBLEM PROGRESS NOTES 9-12-13 Social isolation S:States he does not want to sit with or talk to others; \"they frighten me. \" 1 000 O:Stays in room alone unless strongly encouraged to come out; no group involvement; at times listens to group conversations from a distance but does not interact; some hypervigilance and scanning noted.

Focus Charting dif- fers from POR in that the main perspective has beenchanged from \"problem\" to \"focus,\" and a data, action,and response (DAR) format has replaced SOAPIE. Lampe (1985) suggested that a focus for documen- tation can be any of the following: Nursing diagnosis Current client concern or behaviorSignificant change in the client status or behavior Significant event in the client's therapy The focus cannot be a medical diagnosis. The doc- umentation is organized in the format of DAR. Thesecategories are defined as follows: D =Data: Information that supports the stated focus or describes pertinent observations about the client4092_Ch09_150-173 24/07/14 5:24 PM Page 167A =Action: Immediate or future nursing actions that address the focus, and evaluation of the present care plan along with any changes required R =Response: Description of client's responses to any part of the medical or nursing careTable 9-4 shows how Focus Charting corresponds to the steps of the nursing process.

The PIE Method The PIE method, or more specifically \"APIE\" (assess- ment, problem, intervention, evaluation), is a system-atic approach of documenting to nursing process andnursing diagnosis. A problem-oriented system, PIEcharting uses accompanying flow sheets that are indi- vidualized by each institution. Criteria for documen-tation are organized in the following manner: A = Assessment: A complete client assessment is con- ducted at the beginning of each shift. Results are documented under this section in the progressnotes. Some institutions elect instead to use a dailyclient assessment sheet designed to meet specificneeds of the unit. Explanation of any deviationfrom the norm is included in the progress notes.P =Problem: A problem list, or list of nursing diag- noses, is an important part of the APIE method ofcharting. The name or number of the problembeing addressed is documented in this section. I =Intervention: Nursing actions are performed, directed at resolution of the problem. E = Evaluation: Outcomes of the implemented inter- ventions are documented, including an evaluationof client responses to determine the effectivenessof nursing interventions and the presence or ab-sence of progress toward resolution of a problem. Table 9-5 shows how APIE charting corresponds to the steps of the nursing process. Following is an example of a three-column documentation in theAPIE format.4092_Ch09_150-173 24/07/14 5:24 PM Page 168Electronic Documentation Most health-care facilities have implemented\u2014or are in the process of implementing\u2014some type of elec-tronic health records (EHRs) or electronic documen-tation system. EHRs have been shown to improveboth the quality of client care and the efficiency ofthe health-care system (U.S. Government Accounta-bility Office, 2010). In 2003, the U.S. Department ofHealth and Human Services commissioned the Insti-tute of Medicine (IOM) to study the capabilities of anEHR system. The IOM identified a set of eight corefunctions that EHR systems should perform in the de-livery of safer, higher quality, and more efficienthealth care. These eight core capabilities include thefollowing (Tang, 2003): Health Information and Data. EHRs would provide more rapid access to important patient informa-tion (e.g., allergies, lab test results, a medicationlist, demographic information, and clinical narra-tives) thereby improving care providers' ability tomake sound clinical decisions in a timely manner.Results Management. Computerized results of alltypes (e.g., laboratory test results, radiology proce-dure result reports) can be accessed more easily bythe provider at the time and place they are needed. Order Entry/Order Management. Computer-basedorder entries improve workflow processes by elimi-nating lost orders and ambiguities caused by illegiblehandwriting, generating related orders automati-cally, monitoring for duplicate orders, and improv-ing the speed with which orders are executed. Decision Support. Computerized decision supportsystems enhance clinical performance for many as-pects of health care. Using reminders and prompts,improvement in regular screenings and other pre-ventive practices can be accomplished. Other as-pects of health-care support include identifyingpossible drug interactions and facilitating diagnosisand treatment. Electronic Communication and Connectivity. Im- proved communication among care associates, suchas medicine, nursing, laboratory, pharmacy, and ra-diology, can enhance client safety and quality ofCHAPTER 9 The Nursing Process in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing 169 EXAMPLE DATE/TIME PROBLEM PROGRESS NOTES 9-12-13 1000Social Isolation A: States he does not want to sit with or talk to others; they \"frighten\" him; stays in room alone unless strongly encouragedto come out; no group involvement; at times listens to groupconversations from a distance but does not interact; some hypervigilance and scanning noted.

Efficient communication among providers im- proves continuity of care, allows for more timely in-terventions, and reduces the risk of adverse events. Patient Support. Computer-based interactive client education, self-testing, and self-monitoringhave been shown to improve control of chronicillnesses. Administrative Processes. Electronic scheduling systems (e.g., for hospital admissions and outpa-tient procedures) increase the efficiency of health-care organizations and provide more timely serviceto patients. Reporting and Population Health Management.Health-care organizations are required to reporthealth-care data to government and private sec-tors for patient safety and public health. Uniformelectronic data standards facilitate this process atthe provider level, reduce the associated costs,and increase the speed and accuracy of the datareported. Table 9-6 lists some of the advantages and disad- vantages of paper records and EHRs.Summary and Key Points The nursing process provides a methodology bywhich nurses may deliver care using a systematic,scientific approach. The focus of nursing process is goal directed andbased on a decision-making or problem-solvingmodel, consisting of six steps: assessment, diagno-sis, outcome identification, planning, implementa-tion, and evaluation. Assessment is a systematic, dynamic process bywhich the nurse, through interaction with theclient, significant others, and health-care providers,collects and analyzes data about the client. Nursing diagnoses are clinical judgments about in-dividual, family, or community responses to actualor potential health problems/life processes. Outcomes are measurable, expected, patient-focusedgoals that translate into observable behaviors. Evaluation is the process of determining both theclient's progress toward the attainment of expectedoutcomes and the effectiveness of nursing care.170 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care TABLE 9-6 Advantages and Disadvantages of Paper Records and EHRs PAPER* EHR ADVANTAGES People know how to use it. It is fast for current practice. It is portable. It is nonbreakable. It accepts multiple data types, such as graphs, photographs, drawings, and text. Legal issues and costs are understood. DISADVANTAGES It can be lost. It is often illegible and incomplete. It has no remote access. It can be accessed by only one person at a time. It is often disorganized. Information is duplicated. It is hard to store. It is difficult to research, and continuous quality improvement is laborious. Same client has separate records at each facility (physician's office, hospital, home care). Records are shared only through hard copy *From Young, K.M. (2012). Nursing informatics. In J.T. Catalano (Ed.), issues, (6th ed.) .Philadelphia, PA: F.A. Davis. With permission.ADVANTAGES Can be accessed by multiple providers from remotesites. Facilitates communication between disciplines. Provides reminders about completing information. Provides warnings about incompatibilities of medica-tions or variances from normal standards. Reduces redundancy of information. Requires less storage space and more difficult to lose. Easier to research for audits, quality assurance, andepidemiological surveillance. Provides immediate retrieval of information (e.g., testresults). Provides links to multiple databases of health-careknowledge, thus providing diagnostic support. Decreases charting time. Reduces errors due to illegible handwriting. Facilitates billing and claims procedures. DISADVANTAGES Excessive expense to initiate the system. Substantial learning curve involved for new users;training and retraining required. Stringent requirements to maintain security and confi-dentiality. Technical difficulties are possible. Legal and ethical issues involving privacy and accessto client information. Requires consistent use of standardized terminologyto support information sharing across wide networks.4092_Ch09_150-173 24/07/14 5:24 PM Page 170The psychiatric nurse uses the nursing process to assist clients to adapt successfully to stressors withinthe environment. The nurse serves as a valuable member of the in-terdisciplinary treatment team, working both inde-pendently and cooperatively with other teammembers. Case management is an innovative model of caredelivery that serves to provide quality client carewhile controlling health-care costs. Critical path-ways of care (CPCs) serve as the tools for provisionof care in a case management system. Nurses may serve as case managers, who are re-sponsible for negotiating with multiple health-care providers to obtain a variety of services forthe client. Concept mapping is a diagrammatic teaching andlearning strategy that allows students and faculty tovisualize interrelationships between medical diag-noses, nursing diagnoses, assessment data, and treat-ments. The concept map care plan is an innovativeapproach to planning and organizing nursing care. Nurses must document that the nursing processhas been used in the delivery of care. Three meth-ods of documentation that reflect use of the nurs-ing process include POR, Focus Charting, and thePIE method. Many health-care facilities have implemented theuse of electronic health records (EHRs) or elec-tronic documentation systems. EHRs have beenshown to improve both the quality of client careand the efficiency of the health-care system.CHAPTER 9 The Nursing Process in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing 171 Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

Sampson and Marthas (1990) have stated: We are biological organisms possessing qualities shared with all living systems and with others of our species. We are psychological beings with distinctly human capabilities for thought, feeling, and action. We arealso social beings, who function as part of the complex webs that link us with other people. (p. 3) Health-care professionals not only share their per- sonal lives with groups of people but also encounter multiple group situations in their professional oper-ations. Team conferences, committee meetings,grand rounds, and in-service sessions are but a few.4092_Ch10_174-183 25/07/14 10:23 AM Page 174In psychiatry, work with clients and families often takes the form of groups. With group work, not onlydoes the nurse have the opportunity to reach out toa greater number of people at one time, but thoseindividuals also assist each other by bringing to thegroup and sharing their feelings, opinions, ideas,and behaviors. Clients learn from each other in agroup setting. This chapter explores various types and methods of therapeutic groups that can be used with psychi-atric clients, and the role of the nurse in group intervention.7. Empowerment. Groups help to bring about im- provement in existing conditions by providing sup-port to individual members who seek to bringabout change. Groups have power that individualsalone do not. 8. Governance. An example of the governing func- tion is that of rules being made by committeeswithin a larger organization. Types of Groups The functions of a group vary depending on the rea-son the group was formed. Clark (2003) identifiedthree types of groups in which nurses most often par-ticipate: task, teaching, and supportive/therapeuticgroups. Task Groups The function of a task group is to accomplish a spe-cific outcome or task. The focus is on solving prob-lems and making decisions to achieve this outcome.Often a deadline is placed on completion of thetask, and such importance is placed on a satisfactoryoutcome that conflict in the group may be smoothedover or ignored in order to focus on the priority at hand. Teaching Groups Teaching, or educational, groups exist to conveyknowledge and information to a number of individ-uals. Nurses can be involved in teaching groups ofmany varieties, such as medication education, child-birth education, breast self-examination, and effec-tive parenting classes. These groups usually have aset time frame or a set number of meetings. Mem-bers learn from each other as well as from the des-ignated instructor. The objective of teaching groupsis verbalization or demonstration by the learner ofthe material presented by the end of the designatedperiod. Supportive/Therapeutic Groups The primary concern of support groups is to preventfuture upsets by teaching participants effective waysof dealing with emotional stress arising from situa-tional or developmental crises.CHAPTER 10 Therapeutic Groups 175 CORE CONCEPT Group A group is a collection of individuals whose association is founded on shared commonalities of interest, val- ues, norms, or purpose. Membership in a group isgenerally by chance (born into the group), by choice(voluntary affiliation), or by circumstance (the result oflife-cycle events over which an individual may or maynot have control). Functions of a Group Sampson and Marthas (1990) outlined eight func- tions that groups serve for their members. They con-tend that groups may serve more than one functionand usually serve different functions for differentmembers of the group. The eight functions are asfollows: 1. Socialization. The cultural group into which we are born begins the process of teaching socialnorms. This is continued throughout our lives bymembers of other groups with which we becomeaffiliated. 2. Support. One's fellow group members are avail- able in time of need. Individuals derive a feelingof security from group involvement. 3. Task completion. Group members provide assistance in endeavors that are beyond the capacity of one individual alone or when results can be achievedmore effectively as a team. 4. Camaraderie. Members of a group provide the joy and pleasure that individuals seek from interac-tions with significant others. 5. Informational. Learning takes place within groups. Knowledge is gained when individualmembers learn how others in the group have resolved situations similar to those with which theyare currently struggling. 6 . Normative. This function relates to the ways in which groups enforce the established norms.CORE CONCEPT Group Therapy A form of psychosocial treatment in which a number of clients meet together with a therapist for purposes of sharing, gaining personal insight, and improving interpersonal coping strategies. 4092_Ch10_174-183 25/07/14 10:23 AM Page 175For the purposes of this text, it is important to differentiate between therapeutic groups and group therapy . Leaders of group therapy generally have ad- vanced degrees in psychology, social work, nursing, or medicine. They often have additional training orexperience under the supervision of an accomplishedprofessional in conducting group psychotherapybased on various theoretical frameworks such as psy-choanalytic, psychodynamic, interpersonal, or familydynamics. Approaches based on these theories areused by the group therapy leaders to encourage im-provement in the ability of group members to func-tion on an interpersonal level. Therapeutic groups, on the other hand, are based to a lesser degree in theory. Focus is more on grouprelations, interactions among group members, andthe consideration of a selected issue. Like group ther-apists, individuals who lead therapeutic groups mustbe knowledgeable in group process, that is, the way in which group members interact with each other. In-terruptions, silences, judgments, glares, and scape-goating are examples of group processes (Clark,2003). They must also have thorough knowledge ofgroup content, the topic or issue being discussed withinthe group, and the ability to present the topic in lan-guage that can be understood by all group members.Many nurses who work in psychiatry lead supportive/therapeutic groups. Self-Help Groups An additional type of group, in which nurses may ormay not be involved, is the self-help group. Self-helpgroups have grown in numbers and in credibility inrecent years. They allow clients to talk about theirfears and relieve feelings of isolation, while receiv-ing comfort and advice from others undergoingsimilar experiences. Examples of self-help groups are Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders, AnorexiaNervosa and Associated Disorders, Weight Watchers,Alcoholics Anonymous, Reach to Recovery, ParentsWithout Partners, Overeaters Anonymous, Adult Chil-dren of Alcoholics, and many others related to spe-cific needs or illnesses. These groups may or may nothave a professional leader or consultant. They are runby the members, and leadership often rotates frommember to member. Nurses may become involved with self-help groups either voluntarily or because their advice or participa-tion has been requested by the members. The nursemay function as a referral agent, resource person,member of an advisory board, or leader of the group.Self-help groups are a valuable source of referral forclients with specific problems. However, nurses mustbe knowledgeable about the purposes of the group,membership, leadership, benefits, and problems thatmight threaten the success of the group before mak-ing referrals to their clients for a specific self-helpgroup. The nurse may find it necessary to attend sev-eral meetings of a particular group, if possible, to assess its effectiveness of purpose and appropriatenessfor client referral. Physical Conditions That Influence Group Dynamics Seating The physical conditions for the group should be setup so that there is no barrier between the members.For example, a circle of chairs is better than chairs setaround a table. Members should be encouraged to sitin different chairs each meeting. This openness andchange creates a feeling of discomfort that encour-ages anxious and unsettled behaviors that can thenbe explored within the group. Size Various authors have suggested different ranges ofsize as ideal for group interaction: 5 to 10 (Yalom &Leszcz, 2005), 2 to 15 (Sampson & Marthas, 1990),and 4 to 12 (Clark, 2003). Group size does make adifference in the interaction among members. Thelarger the group, the less time is available to devoteto individual members. In fact, in larger groups,those more aggressive individuals are most likely tobe heard, whereas quieter members may be left outof the discussions altogether. On the other hand,larger groups provide more opportunities for indi-viduals to learn from other members. The widerrange of life experiences and knowledge provides a greater potential for effective group problem solv-ing. Studies have indicated that a composition of 7 or 8 members provides a favorable climate for optimal group interaction and relationship devel-opment. Membership Whether the group is open or closed ended is an-other condition that influences the dynamics ofgroup process. Open-ended groups are those inwhich members leave and others join at any timewhile the group is active. The continuous movementof members in and out of the group creates the typeof discomfort described previously that encouragesunsettled behaviors in individual members and fos-ters the exploration of feelings. These are the mostcommon types of groups held on short-term inpatientunits, although they are used in outpatient and long-term care facilities as well. Closed-ended groups usu-ally have a predetermined, fixed time frame. Allmembers join at the time the group is organized and176 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch10_174-183 25/07/14 10:23 AM Page 176terminate at the end of the designated time period. Closed-ended groups are often composed of individ-uals with common issues or problems they wish to address. Curative Factors Why are therapeutic groups helpful? Yalom andLeszcz (2005) have described 11 curative factors thatindividuals can achieve through interpersonal inter-actions within the group, some of which are presentin most groups in varying degrees: 1. The Instillation of Hope. By observing the progress of others in the group with similar prob-lems, a group member garners hope that his orher problems can also be resolved. 2. Universality. Through universality, individuals come to realize that they are not alone in the prob-lems, thoughts, and feelings they are experiencing.Anxiety is relieved by the support and understand-ing of others in the group who share similar (uni-versal) experiences. 3. The Imparting of Information. Knowledge is gained through formal instruction as well as thesharing of advice and suggestions among groupmembers. 4. Altruism. Altruism is assimilated by group members through mutual sharing and concern for each other. Providing assistance and support to others creates apositive self-image and promotes self-growth. 5 . The Corrective Recapitulation of the Primary Family Group. Group members are able to re- experience early family conflicts that remain un-resolved. Attempts at resolution are promotedthrough feedback and exploration. 6 . The Development of Socializing Techniques. Through interaction with and feedback fromother members within the group, individuals areable to correct maladaptive social behaviors andlearn and develop new social skills. 7. Imitative Behavior. In this setting, one who has mastered a particular psychosocial skill or devel-opmental task can be a valuable role model forothers. Individuals may imitate selected behaviorsthat they wish to develop in themselves. 8. Interpersonal Learning. The group offers many and varied opportunities for interacting with otherpeople. Insight is gained regarding how one per- ceives and is being perceived by others. 9. Group Cohesiveness. Members develop a sense of belonging that separates the individual (\"I am\")from the group (\"we are\"). Out of this allianceemerges a common feeling that both individualmembers and the total group are of value to eachother.1 0. Catharsis. Within the group, members are able to express both positive and negative feelings\u2014perhaps feelings that have never been expressed before\u2014in a nonthreatening atmosphere. Thiscatharsis , or open expression of feelings, is bene- ficial for the individual within the group. 11. Existential Factors. The group is able to help in- dividual members take direction of their ownlives and to accept responsibility for the quality oftheir existence. It may be helpful for a group leader to explain these curative factors to members of the group. Posi-tive responses are experienced by individuals who understand and are able to recognize curative factorsas they occur within the group. Phases of Group Development Groups, like individuals, move through phases of life-cycle development. Ideally, groups will progress fromthe phase of infancy to advanced maturity in an effortto fulfill the objectives set forth by the membership.Unfortunately, as with individuals, some groups be-come fixed in early developmental levels and neverprogress, or experience periods of regression in thedevelopmental process. Three phases of group devel-opment are discussed here. Phase I: Initial or Orientation Phase Group Activities Leader and members work together to establish therules that will govern the group (e.g., when and wheremeetings will occur, the importance of confidentiality,how meetings will be structured). Goals of the groupare established. Members are introduced to eachother. Leader Expectations The leader is expected to orient members to specificgroup processes, encourage members to participatewithout disclosing too much too soon, promote anenvironment of trust, and ensure that rules estab-lished by the group do not interfere with fulfillmentof the goals. Member Behaviors In phase I, members have not yet established trustand will respond to this lack of trust by being overlypolite. There is a fear of not being accepted by thegroup. They may try to \"get on the good side\" of theleader with compliments and conforming behav-iors. A power struggle may ensue as members com-pete for their position in the \"pecking order\" of thegroup.CHAPTER Therapeutic Groups 1774092_Ch10_174-183 25/07/14 10:23 AM Page 177Phase II: Middle or Working Phase Group Activities Ideally, during the working phase, cohesiveness has been established within the group. This is when theproductive work toward completion of the task is un-dertaken. Problem solving and decision making occurwithin the group. In the mature group, cooperationprevails, and differences and disagreements are con-fronted and resolved. Leader Expectations The role of leader diminishes and becomes more oneof facilitator during the working phase. Some leader-ship functions are shared by certain members of thegroup as they progress toward resolution. The leaderhelps to resolve conflict and continues to foster cohe-siveness among the members while ensuring that theydo not deviate from the intended task or purpose forwhich the group was organized. Member Behaviors At this point trust has been established among themembers. They turn more often to each other andless often to the leader for guidance. They acceptcriticism from each other, using it in a constructivemanner to create change. Occasionally, subgroupswill form in which two or more members conspirewith each other to the exclusion of the rest of thegroup. To maintain group cohesion, these sub-groups must be confronted and discussed by theentire membership. Conflict is managed by thegroup with minimal assistance from the leader. Phase III: Final or Termination Phase Group Activities The longer a group has been in existence, the moredifficult termination is likely to be for the members.Termination should be mentioned from the outset ofgroup formation. It should be discussed in depth forseveral meetings prior to the final session. A sense ofloss that precipitates the grief process may be in evi-dence, particularly in groups that have been success-ful in their stated purpose. Leader Expectations In the termination phase, the leader encourages thegroup members to reminisce about what has oc-curred within the group, to review the goals and dis-cuss the actual outcomes, and to encourage membersto provide feedback to each other about individualprogress within the group. The leader encouragesmembers to discuss feelings of loss associated with termination of the group.Member Behaviors Members may express surprise over the actual materi-alization of the end. This represents the grief responseof denial, which may then progress to anger. Anger to-ward other group members or toward the leader mayreflect feelings of abandonment (Sampson & Marthas,1990). These feeli ngs may lead to individual mem- bers' discussions of previous losses for which similaremotions were experienced. Successful terminationof the group may help members develop the skillsneeded when losses occur in other dimensions oftheir lives. Leadership Styles Lippitt and White (1958) identified three of the mostcommon group leadership styles: autocratic, demo-cratic, and laissez-faire. Table 10-1 shows an outlineof various similarities and differences among thethree leadership styles. Autocratic Autocratic leaders have personal goals for the group. They withhold information from group members,particularly issues that may interfere with achieve-ment of their own objectives. The message that is con-veyed to the group is: \"We will do it my way. My way isbest.\" The focus in this style of leadership is on theleader. Members are dependent on the leader forproblem solving, decision making, and permission toperform. The approach of the autocratic leader isone of persuasion, striving to persuade others in thegroup that his or her ideas and methods are superior.Productivity is high with this type of leadership, butoften morale within the group is low because of lackof member input and creativity. Democratic The democratic leadership style focuses on the mem- bers of the group. Information is shared with mem-bers in an effort to allow them to make decisionsregarding achieving the goals for the group. Membersare encouraged to participate fully in problem solvingof issues that relate to the group, including taking ac-tion to effect change. The message that is conveyedto the group is: \"Decide what must be done, considerthe alternatives, make a selection, and proceed withthe actions required to complete the task.\" The leaderprovides guidance and expertise as needed. Produc-tivity is lower than it is with autocratic leadership, butmorale is much higher because of the extent of inputallowed all members of the group and the potentialfor individual creativity.178 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch10_174-183 25/07/14 10:23 AM Page 178Laissez-Faire This leadership style allows people to do as they please. There is no direction from the leader. In fact,the laissez-faire leader's approach is noninvolvement. Goals for the group are undefined. No decisions aremade, no problems are solved, and no action is taken.Members become frustrated and confused, and pro-ductivity and morale are low. Member Roles Benne and Sheats (1948) identified three major typesof roles that individuals play within the membershipof the group. These are roles that serve to: 1.Complete the task of the group. 2.Maintain or enhance group processes. 3.Fulfill personal or individual needs. Ta sk roles and maintenance roles contribute to the success or effectiveness of the group. Personal rolessatisfy needs of the individual members, sometimesto the extent of interfering with the effectiveness ofthe group. Table 10-2 presents an outline of specific roles within these three major types and the behaviors associated with each. Psychodrama A specialized type of therapeutic group, called psy- chodrama, was introduced by J. L. Moreno, a Viennesepsychiatrist. Moreno's method employs a dramatic approach in which clients become \"actors\" in life-situation scenarios. The group leader is called the director, group mem- bers are the audience, and the set, or stage , may be spe- cially designed or may just be any room or part of aroom selected for this purpose. Actors are membersfrom the audience who agree to take part in the\"drama\" by role-playing a situation about which theyhave been informed by the director. Usually the situ-ation is an issue with which one individual client hasbeen struggling. The client plays the role of himselfor herself and is called the protagonist. In this role, theclient is able to express true feelings toward individu-als (represented by group members) with whom heor she has unresolved conflicts. In some instances, the group leader may ask for a client to volunteer to be the protagonist for that ses-sion. The client may choose a situation he or shewishes to enact and select the audience members toportray the roles of others in the life situation. Thepsychodrama setting provides the client with a saferand less threatening atmosphere than the real situa-tion in which to express true feelings. Resolution ofinterpersonal conflicts is facilitated. When the drama has been completed, group mem- bers from the audience discuss the situation they haveobserved, offer feedback, express their feelings, andrelate their own similar experiences. In this way, allgroup members benefit from the session, either directly or indirectly. Nurses often serve as actors, or role players, in psychodrama sessions.

The Role of the Nurse in Group Therapy Nurses participate in group situations on a daily basis.In health-care settings, nurses serve on or lead taskgroups that create policy, describe procedures, andplan client care. They are also involved in a variety ofother groups aimed at the institutional effort of serv-ing the consumer. Nurses are encouraged to use thesteps of the nursing process as a framework for taskgroup leadership. In psychiatry, nurses may lead various types of therapeutic groups, such as client education, 4092_Ch10_174-183 25/07/14 10:23 AM Page 180assertiveness training, support, parent, and transi- tion to discharge groups, among others. To function effectively in the leadership capacity for thesegroups, nurses need to be able to recognize variousprocesses that occur in groups, such as the phasesof group development, the various roles that peopleplay within group situations, and the motivation behind the behavior. They also need to be able toselect the most appropriate leadership style for thetype of group being led. Generalist nurses may develop these skills as part of their undergraduateeducation, or they may pursue additional studywhile serving and learning as the co-leader of agroup with a more experienced nurse leader. Generalist nurses in psychiatry rarely serve as leaders of psychotherapy groups. The Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing Scope and Standards of Practice(American Nurses Association, 2007) specifies thatnurses who serve as group psychotherapists shouldhave a minimum of a master's degree in psychiatricnursing. Other criteria that have been suggested areeducational preparation in group theory, extendedpractice as a group co-leader or leader under the su-pervision of an experienced psychotherapist, andparticipation in group therapy on an experientiallevel. Additional specialist training is required be-yond the master's level to prepare nurses to becomefamily therapists or psychodramatists. Leading therapeutic groups is within the realm of nursing practice. Because group work is such acommon therapeutic approach in the discipline ofpsychiatry, nurses working in this field must contin-ually strive to expand their knowledge and use ofgroup process as a significant psychiatric nursing intervention. CLINICAL PEARL Knowledge of human behavior in general and the group process in particular is essential to effective group leadership. Summary and Key Points A group has been defined as a collection of individ- uals whose association is founded on shared com-monalities of interest, values, norms, or purpose. Eight group functions have been identified: socializa-tion, support, task completion, camaraderie, informa-tional, normative, empowerment, and governance. There are three major types of groups: task groups,teaching groups, and supportive/therapeuticgroups. The function of task groups is to solve problems,make decisions, and achieve a specific outcome.In teaching groups, knowledge and informationare conveyed to a number of individuals. The function of supportive/therapeutic groups is to educate people to deal effectively with emo-tional stress in their lives. In self-help groups, individuals share a commonproblem. Members of the group provide eachother with mutual support as they deal with, or pos-sibly try to recover from, the problem. Therapeutic groups differ from group therapy in that group therapy is more theory based and the leaders generally have advanced degrees in psychology, social work, nursing, or medicine. Placement of the seating and size of the group caninfluence group interaction. Groups can be open-ended (when members leaveand others join at any time while the group is active)or closed-ended (when groups have a predeter-mined, fixed time frame and all members join at thesame time and leave when the group disbands). Yalom and Leszcz (2005) describe the following cur-ative factors that individuals derive from participa-tion in therapeutic groups: the instillation of hope,universality, the imparting of information, altruism,the corrective recapitulation of the primary familygroup, the development of socializing techniques,imitative behavior, interpersonal learning, group cohesiveness, catharsis, and existential factors. Groups progress through three phases: the initial(orientation) phase, the working phase, and thetermination phase. Group leadership styles include autocratic, demo-cratic, and laissez-faire. Members play various roles within groups. Theseroles are categorized according to task roles, main-tenance roles, and personal roles. Psychodrama is a specialized type of group ther-apy that uses a dramatic approach in which clientsbecome \"actors\" in life-situation scenarios. The psychodrama setting provides the client witha safer and less threatening atmosphere than thereal situation in which to express and work throughunresolved conflicts. Nurses lead various types of therapeutic groups inthe psychiatric setting. Knowledge of human be-havior in general and the group process in partic-ular is essential to effective group leadership. Specialized training, in addition to a master's degree, is required for nurses to serve as group psychotherapists or psychodramatists.CHAPTER 10 Therapeutic Groups 181 Additional info available at www.davisplus.com4092_Ch10_174-183 25/07/14 10:23 AM Page 181182 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

Wright and Leahey (2013) propose the following definition: a family is who they say theyare. Many family forms exist within society today, suchas the biological family of procreation, the nuclearfamily that incorporates one or more members of theextended family (family of origin), the sole-parentfamily, the stepfamily, the communal family, and thehomosexual couple or family. Labeling individuals as\"families\" based on their group composition may notbe the best way, however. Instead, family considera-tion may be more appropriately determined based onattributes of affection, strong emotional ties, a senseof belonging, and durability of membership (Wright& Leahey, 2013).HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT Please read the chapter and answer the following questions: 1.Describe the concept of \"reframing.\" 2.Describe the process of triangulation in a dysfunctional family pattern.3.How are genograms helpful in family therapy? 4.What behaviors are of a positivefamily climate?4092_Ch11_184-207 23/07/14 11:55 AM Page 184Many nurses have interactions with family mem- bers on a daily basis. A client's illness or hospitaliza- tion affects all members of the family, and nursesmust understand how to work with the family as aunit, knowing that family members can have a pro-found effect on the client's healing process. Nurse generalists should be familiar with the tasks as- sociated with adaptive family functioning. With thisknowledge, they are able to assess family interactionand recognize problems when they arise. They canprovide support to families with an ill member andmake referrals to other professionals when assistanceis required to restore adaptive functioning. Nurse specialists usually possess an advanced degree in nursing. Some nurse specialists have education orexperience that qualifies them to perform family ther-apy. Family therapy is broadly defined as \"a form of intervention in which members of a family are assistedin identifying and changing problematic, maladap-tive, repetitive relationship patterns, as well as self-defeating or self-limiting belief systems\" (Goldenberg,Goldenberg, & Pelavin, 2011, p. 417). Family therapyhas a strong theoretical focus, and a number of con-ceptual approaches have been introduced and sug-gested as frameworks for this intervention. This chapter explores the stages of family develop- ment and compares the \"typical\" family within vari-ous subcultures. Characteristics of adaptive familyfunctioning and behaviors that interfere with thisadaptation are discussed. Theoretical components ofselected therapeutic approaches are described. In-structions for construction of a family genogram areincluded. Nursing process provides the framework fornursing intervention with families.Stages of Family Development McGoldrick, Carter, and Garcia-Preto (2011) identi-fied stages and developmental tasks that describe thefamily life cycle. It is acknowledged that these taskswould vary greatly among diverse cultural groups, aswell as the various forms of families previously de-scribed. These stages, however, provide a valuableframework from which the nurse may study families,emphasizing expansion (the addition of members),contraction (the loss of members), and realignmentof relationships as members experience developmen-tal changes. These stages of family development aredescribed in the following paragraphs, and are sum-marized in Table 11-1. The Single Young Adult This model begins with the launching of the youngadult from the family of origin. This is a difficult stagebecause young adults must decide what social stan-dards from the family of origin will be preserved andwhat they will change for themselves to be incorpo-rated into a new family. Tasks of this stage includeforming an identity separate from the parents, estab-lishing intimate peer relationships, and advancing CHAPTER 11 Intervention With Families 185 CORE CONCEPTS Family Two or more individuals who depend on one another for emotional, physical, and economical support. The mem-bers of the family are self-defined (Kaakinen, Hanson, &Denham, 2010, p. 5).

Problems can arise when either the young adults or the parents en-counter difficulty terminating the interdependent relationship that has existed in the family of origin. The Family Joined Through Marriage/Union Uniting as a couple is a difficult transition because renegotiation must include the integration of contrast-ing issues that each partner brings to the relationshipand issues they may have redefined for themselves asa couple. In addition, the new couple must renegoti-ate relationships with parents, siblings, and other rel-atives in view of the new partnership. Tasks of thisstage include establishing a new identity as a couple,realigning relationships with members of extendedfamily, and making decisions about having children.Problems can arise if either partner remains too en-meshed with their family of origin or when the couplechooses to cut themselves off completely from ex-tended family. The Family With Young Children Adjustments in relationships must occur with the ar-rival of children. The entire family system is affectedand role realignments are necessary for both new par-ents and new grandparents. Tasks of this stage includemaking adjustments within the marital system to meetthe responsibilities associated with parenthood whilemaintaining the integrity of the couple relationship,sharing equally in the tasks of child rearing, and inte-grating the roles of extended family members into the4092_Ch11_184-207 23/07/14 11:55 AM Page 186newly expanded family organization. Problems can arise when parents lack knowledge about normal child-hood development and adequate patience to allowchildren to express themselves through behavior. The Family With Adolescents This stage of family development is characterized bya great deal of turmoil and transition. Parents are approaching a midlife stage and adolescents are un-dergoing biological, emotional, and socioculturalchanges that place demands on each individual andon the family unit. Grandparents, too, may require assistance with the tasks of later life. These develop-ments can create a \"sandwich\" effect for the parents,who must deal with issues confronting three genera-tions. Tasks of this stage include redefining the levelof dependence so that adolescents are provided withgreater autonomy while parents remain responsive tothe teenager's dependency needs. Midlife issues re-lated to marriage, career, and aging parents must alsobe resolved during this period. Problems can arisewhen parents are unable to relinquish control andallow the adolescent greater autonomy and freedomto make independent decisions or when parents areunable to agree and support each other in this effort. The Family Launching Children and Mov- ing On in Midlife A great deal of realignment of family roles occurs during this stage. This stage is characterized by theintermittent exiting and entering of various familymembers. Children leave home for further educa-tion and careers; marriages occur, and new spouses,in-laws, and children enter the system; and newgrandparent roles are established. Adult-to-adult re-lationships among grown children and their parentsare renegotiated. Tasks associated with this stage in-clude reestablishing the bond of the dyadic maritalrelationship; realigning relationships to includegrown children, in-laws, and new grandchildren; andaccepting the additional caretaking responsibilitiesand eventual death of elderly parents. Problems canarise when feelings of loss and depression becomeoverwhelming in response to the departure of chil-dren from the home, when parents are unable to ac-cept their children as adults or cope with thedisability or death of their own parents, and whenthe marital bond has deteriorated. The Family in Later Life (Late Middle Age to End of Life) This stage can begin with retirement and last until the death of both spouses (Wright & Leahey, 2013). How-ever, many older people who have the opportunity todo so are choosing to retire early, while large numbersof those over age 65 are remaining in the workforceand delaying their retirement. Thus, the beginningof this stage varies widely. Most adults in their lateryears are still a prominent part of the family system,and many are able to offer support to their grownchildren in the middle generation. Tasks associatedwith this stage include exploring new social roles re-lated to retirement and possible change in socioeco-nomic status; accepting some decline in physiologicalfunctioning; dealing with the deaths of spouse, sib-lings, and friends; and confronting and preparing forone's own death. Problems may arise when olderadults have failed to fulfill the tasks associated withearlier levels of development and are dissatisfied withthe way their lives have gone. They are unable to findhappiness in retirement or emotional satisfaction withchildren and grandchildren, and they are unable toaccept the deaths of loved ones or to prepare for theirown impending death. Major Variations Divorce McGoldrick, Carter, and Garcia-Preto (2011) also dis-cuss stages and tasks of families experiencing divorceand remarriage. Data on marriage, divorce, and re-marriage in the United States show that about half offirst marriages end in divorce (Centers for DiseaseControl [CDC], 2012). Some statistics indicate thatthe divorce rate may be on the decline since the1970s. In 2009, however, almost 30 percent of all fam-ilies in the United States were headed by solo parents(U.S. Census Bureau, 2013). Stages in the family lifecycle of divorce include deciding to divorce, planningthe breakup of the system, separation, and divorce.Tasks include accepting one's own part in the failureof the marriage, working cooperatively on problemsrelated to custody and visitation of children and fi-nances, realigning relationships with extended family,and mourning the loss of the marriage relationshipand the intact family. After the divorce, the custodial parent must adjust to functioning as the single leader of an ongoing familywhile working to rebuild a new social network. Thenoncustodial parent must find ways to continue to bean effective parent while remaining outside the normalparenting role. Remarriage A large percentage of people who divorce eventuallyremarry. In 2009, 16 percent (11.7 million) of all chil-dren in the United States lived in blended families(those that contain stepchildren and their steppar-ents, half siblings, or stepsiblings) (Kreider & Ellis,2011). The challenges that face the joining of two CHAPTER 11 Intervention With Families 1874092_Ch11_184-207 23/07/14 11:55 AM Page 187established families are immense, and statistics re- veal that the rate of divorce for remarried couples iseven higher than the divorce rate following first mar-riages (Cory, 2013). Stages in the remarried familylife cycle include entering the new relationship,planning the new marriage and family, and remar-riage and reestablishment of family. Tasks includemaking a firm commitment to confronting the com-plexities of combining two families, maintainingopen communication, facing fears, realigning rela-tionships with extended family to include newspouse and children, and encouraging healthy rela-tionships with biological (noncustodial) parents andgrandparents. Problems can arise when there is a blurring of bound- aries between the custodial and noncustodial families.Children may contemplate, \"Who is the boss now? Whois most important, the child or the new spouse? Momloves her new husband more than she loves me. Dad letsme do more than my new stepdad does. I don't have tomind him; he's not my real dad.\" Confusion and distressfor both the children and the parents can be avoidedwith the establishment of clear boundaries. Goldenberg and Goldenberg (2013) state: Successful adaptation to stepfamily life calls for the ability to recognize and cope with a variety of prob-lems: stepparents assuming a parental role, rulechanges, jealousy and competition between stepsib-lings as well as between birth parents and stepparents,loyalty conflicts in children between the absent par-ent and the stepparent, and financial obligations forchild support while entering into a new marriage, toname but a few. Remarriage itself may resurrect old,unresolved feelings, such as anger and hurt left overfrom a previous marriage. (p. 435) Cultural Variations It is difficult to generalize about variations in family life-cycle development according to culture. Mostfamilies have become acculturated to the U.S. societyand conform to the life-cycle stages previously de-scribed. However, cultural diversity does exist andnurses must be aware of possible differences in familyexpectations related to sociocultural beliefs. Theymust also be aware of a great deal of variation withinethnic groups as well as among them. Some variationsthat may be considered follow. Marriage A number of U.S. subcultures maintain traditional values in terms of marriage. Traditional views aboutfamily life and Roman Catholicism exert important in-fluences on attitudes toward marriage in many ItalianAmerican and Latino American families. Although the tradition of arranged marriages is disappearing in Asian American families, there is still frequently a strong influence by the family on mate selection inthis culture. In most of these subcultures, the father is considered the authority figure and head of thehousehold and the mother assumes the role of home-maker and caretaker. Family loyalty is intense and a breach of this loyalty brings considerable shame tothe family. Valley (2005) makes the following statement about Jewish families: The Jewish family today encompasses a wide variety of textures and forms. Decades of high intermarriagehave diversified the customs and complexions of thefamily. High divorce rates, meanwhile, have alteredthe very definition of what is \"normal.\" Whereas single-parent households were once a rare exception,they now account for an increasing proportion ofAmerican Jewish families. Some in the communityhave interpreted the changing family in strident andjudgmental terms: it is a sign of rampant assimilation,loss of tradition or moral permissiveness. But suchscolding does nothing to respond to the new realitiesand to the changing needs of Jews today. (p. 2) Children In traditional Latino American and Italian American cultures, children are central to the family system.Many of these individuals have strong ties to RomanCatholicism, which historically has promoted maritalrelations for procreation only, and encouraged fami-lies to have large numbers of children. Regardingbirth control, the Catechism of the Catholic Churchpronounces as immoral any means that interfereswith or hinders procreation (U.S. Catholic Church,2006). In the traditional Jewish community, having chil- dren is seen as a scriptural and social obligation. \"Youshall be fruitful and multiply\" is a commandment ofthe Torah. In some traditional Asian American cultures, sons are more highly valued than are daughters, and thereis a strong preference for sons over daughters (Earp,2013; Xu & Chang, 2013). Younger siblings are ex-pected to follow the guidance of the oldest sonthroughout their lives, and when the father dies, theoldest son takes over the leadership of the family. In all of these cultures, children are expected to be respectful of their parents and not bring shame tothe family. Especially in the Asian culture, childrenlearn a sense of obligation to their parents for bring-ing them into this world and caring for them whenthey were helpless. This is viewed as a debt that cannever be truly repaid, and no matter what the parentsmay do, the child is still obligated to give respect andobedience.188 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch11_184-207 23/07/14 11:55 AM Page 188Extended Family The concept of extended family varies among soci- eties (Purnell, 2013). The extended family is ex-tremely important in the Western European, Latino,and Asian cultures, playing a central role in all aspectsof life, including decision making. In some U.S. subcultures, such as Asian, Latino, Ital- ian, and Iranian, it is not uncommon to find severalgenerations living together. Older family members arevalued for their experience and wisdom. Because ex-tended families often share living quarters, or at leastlive nearby, tasks of child rearing may be shared by sev-eral generations. Divorce In the Jewish community, divorce is often seen as a vi-olation of family togetherness. Some Jewish parentstake their child's divorce personally, with a responsethat reflects, \"How could you possibly do this to me?\" Because Roman Catholicism has traditionally op- posed divorce, those cultures that are largely Catholichave followed this dictate. Historically, a low divorcerate has existed among Italian Americans, Irish Amer-icans, and Latino Americans. The number of divorcesamong these subcultures is on the rise, however, par-ticularly in successive generations that have becomemore acculturated into a society where divorce ismore acceptable. Family Functioning Boyer and Jeffrey (1994) describe six elements onwhich families are assessed to be either functional ordysfunctional. Each can be viewed on a continuum,although families rarely fall at extreme ends of thecontinuum. Rather, they tend to be dynamic and fluc-tuate from one point to another within the differentareas. These six elements of assessment are describedbelow and summarized in Table 11-2. Communication Functional communication patterns are those inwhich verbal and nonverbal messages are clear, direct,and congruent between sender and intended re-ceiver. Family members are encouraged to expresshonest feelings and opinions, and all members par-ticipate in decisions that affect the family system. Eachmember is an active listener to the other members ofthe family. Behaviors that interfere with functional communi- cation include the following. Making Assumptions With this behavior, one assumes that others will knowwhat is meant by an action or an expression (or some-times even what one is thinking); or, on the otherhand, assumes to know what another member isthinking or feeling without checking to make certain. EXAMPLE A mother says to her teenaged daughter, \"You should have known that I expected you to clean up the kitchen while Iwas gone!\" Belittling Feelings This action involves ignoring or minimizing another's feelings when they are expressed. This encouragesthe individual to withhold honest feelings to avoidbeing hurt by the negative response.CHAPTER 11 Intervention With Families 189 TABLE 11-2 Family Functioning: Elements of Assessment ELEMENTS OF ASSESSMENT CONTINUUM FUNCTIONAL DYSFUNCTIONAL Communication Self-concept reinforcement Family members' expectations Handling differences F amily interactional patterns Family climate SOURCE: Adapted from Boyer & Jeffery (1994).Clear, direct, open, and honest, with congruence between verbal and nonverbal Supportive, loving, praising, approving, with behaviors that instill confidence Flexible, realistic, individualized Tolerant, dynamic, negotiating Workable, constructive, flexible, and promoting the needs of all members Trusting, growth-promoting, caring, general feeling of well-beingIndirect, vague, controlled, with many double-bind messages Unsupportive, blaming, \"put-downs,\" refusing to allow self-responsibility Judgmental, rigid, controlling, ignoring individuality Attacking, avoiding, surrenderingContradictory, rigid, self-defeating, and destructive Distrusting, emotionally painful, with absence of hope for improvement4092_Ch11_184-207 23/07/14 11:55 AM Page 189EXAMPLE When the young woman confides to her mother that she is angry because the grandfather has touched her breast, the mother responds, \"Oh, don't be angry. He doesn't meananything by that.\" Failing to Listen With this behavior, one does not hear what the other individual is saying. This can mean not hearing thewords by \"tuning out\" what is being said, or it can be\"selective\" listening, in which a person hears only a se-lective part of the message or interprets it in a selectivemanner. EXAMPLE The father explains to Johnny, \"If the contract comes through and I get this new job, we'll have a little extra money and we will consider sending you to State U.\" Johnny relays themessage to his friend, \"Dad says I can go to State U!\" Communicating Indirectly This usually means that an individual does not or can- not present a message to a receiver directly, so seeksto communicate through a third person. EXAMPLE A father does not want his teenage daughter to see a certain boyfriend, but wants to avoid the angry response he expectsfrom his daughter if he tells her so. He expresses his feelingsto his wife, hoping she will share them with their daughter. Presenting Double-Bind Messages Double-bind communication conveys a \"damned if I do and damned if I don't\" message. A family mem- ber may respond to a direct request by another fam-ily member, only to be rebuked when the request isfulfilled. EXAMPLE The father tells his son he is spending too much time playing football, and as a result, his grades are falling. He is expectedto bring his grades up over the next 9 weeks or his car willbe taken away. When the son tells the father he has quit thefootball team so he can study more, Dad responds angrily,\"I won't allow any son of mine to be a quitter!\" Self-Concept Reinforcement Functional families strive to reinforce and strengthen each member's self-concept, with the positive resultsbeing that family members feel loved and valued.Boyer and Jeffrey (1994) stated: The manner in which children see and value them- selves is influenced most significantly by the messagesthey receive concerning their value to other membersof the family. Messages that convey praise, approval,appreciation, trust, and confidence in decisions andthat allow family members to pursue individual needsand ultimately to become independent are the foun-dation blocks of a child's feelings of self-worth. Adultsalso need and depend heavily on this kind of rein-forcement for their own emotional well-being. (p. 27) Behaviors that interfere with self-concept reinforce- ment follow. Expressing Denigrating Remarks These remarks are commonly called \"put-downs.\" In- dividuals receive messages that they are worthless orunloved. EXAMPLE A child spills a glass of milk at the table. The mother responds, \"You are hopeless! How could anybody be so clumsy?!\" Withholding Supportive Messages Some family members find it very difficult to provide others with reinforcing and supportive messages. Thismay be because they themselves have not been the re-cipients of reinforcement from significant others andhave not learned how to provide support to others. EXAMPLE A 10-year-old boy playing Little League baseball retrieves the ball and throws it to second base for an out. After the gamehe says to his Dad, \"Did you see my play on second base?\"Dad responds, \"Yes, I did, son, but if you had been payingbetter attention, you could have caught the ball for a directand immediate out.\" Taking Over This occurs when one family member fails to permit another member to develop a sense of responsibilityand self-worth, by doing things for the individual in-stead of allowing him or her to manage the situationindependently. EXAMPLE Twelve-year-old Eric has a job delivering the evening paper, which he usually begins right after school. Today he mustserve a 1-hour detention after school for being late to classyesterday. He tells his Mom, \"Tommy said he would throwmy papers for me today if I help him wash his Dad's car onSaturday.\" Mom responds, \"Never mind. Tell Tommy to forgetit. I'll take care of your paper route today.\" Family Members' Expectations All individuals have some expectations about the out- comes of the life situations they experience. These ex-pectations are related to and significantly influencedby earlier life experiences. In functional families, ex-pectations are realistic, thereby avoiding setting upfamily members for failure. In functional families, ex-pectations are also flexible. Life situations are full ofextraneous and unexpected interferences. Flexibility190 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch11_184-207 23/07/14 11:55 AM Page 190allows for changes and interruptions to occur without creating conflict. Finally, in functional families, expec-tations are individualized. Each family member is dif-ferent, with different strengths and limitations. Theoutcome of a life situation for one family membermay not be realistic for another. Each member mustbe valued independently, and comparison amongmembers avoided. Behaviors that interfere with adaptive functioning in terms of member expectations include the following. Ignoring Individuality This occurs when family members are expected toperform or behave in ways that undermine their in-dividuality or that do not suit their current life situa-tion. This sometimes happens when parents expecttheir children to fulfill the hopes and dreams the par-ents have failed to achieve, yet the children have theirown, different hopes and dreams. EXAMPLE Bob, an only child, leaves for college next year. Bob's father, Robert, inherited a hardware store that was founded by Bob'sgreat-grandfather and has been in the family for three gener-ations. Robert expects Bob to major in business, work in thestore after college, and take over the business when Robertretires. Bob, however, has a talent for writing, wants to majorin communication, and wants to work in TV news when hegraduates. Robert sees this as a betrayal of the family. Demanding Proof of Love Boyer and Jeffrey (1994) state: Family members place expectations on others' behav- ior that are used as standards by which the expectingmember determines how much the other memberscare for him or her. The message attached to theseexpectations is: \"If you will not be as I wish you to be,you don't love me.\" (p. 32) EXAMPLE This is the message that Bob receives from his father in the example cited in the previous paragraph. Handling Differences It is difficult to conceive of two or more individuals liv- ing together who agree on everything all of the time.Serious problems in a family's functioning appearwhen differences become equated with disapproval orwhen disagreement is perceived as offensive. Membersof a functional family understand that it is acceptableto disagree and deal with differences in an open,nonattacking manner. Members are willing to hear theother person's position, respect the other person'sright to hold an opposing position, and work to mod-ify the expectations on both sides of the issue in orderto negotiate a workable solution.Behaviors that interfere with successful family negotiations follow. Attacking Personal attacks can occur when a difference of opin-ion deteriorates. One person may blame the otherwith insulting remarks, reminders of past transgres-sions may occur, and the situation intensifies with destructive expressions of anger and hurt. EXAMPLE When Nancy's husband, John, buys an expensive set of golf clubs, Nancy responds, \"How could you do such a thing? Youknow we can't afford those! No wonder we don't have a nicehouse like all our friends. You spend all our money beforewe can save for a down payment. You're so selfish! We'llnever have anything nice and it's all your fault!\" Avoiding With this tactic, differences are never acknowledged openly. The individual who disagrees avoids dis-cussing it for fear that the other person will withdrawlove or approval or become angry in response to thedisagreement. Avoidance also occurs when an indi-vidual fears loss of control of his or her temper if thedisagreement is brought out into the open. EXAMPLE Vicki and Clint have been married 6 months. This is Vicki's second marriage and she has a 4-year-old son from her firstmarriage, Derek, who lives with her and Clint. Both Vicki andClint work, and Derek goes to day care. Since the marriage6 months ago, Derek cries every night continuously unlessVicki spends all her time with him, which she does in orderto keep him quiet. Clint resents this but says nothing for fearhe will come across as interfering; however, he has startedgoing back to work in his office in the evenings to avoid thefamily situation. Surrendering The person who surrenders in the face of disagree- ment does so at the expense of denying his or herown needs or rights. The individual avoids expressinga difference of opinion for fear of angering anotherperson or of losing approval and support. EXAMPLE Elaine is the only child of wealthy parents. She attends an exclusive private college in a small New England town, whereshe met Andrew, the son of a farming couple from the area.Andrew attended the local community college for 2 yearsbut chose to work on his parents' farm rather than continuecollege. Elaine and Andrew love each other and want to bemarried, but Elaine's parents say they will disown her if shemarries Andrew, who they believe is below her social status.Elaine breaks off her relationship with Andrew rather thanchallenge her parents' wishes.CHAPTER 11 Intervention With AM Page 191Family Interactional Patterns Interactional patterns have to do with the ways in which families \"behave.\" All families develop recur-ring, predictable patterns of interaction over time.These are often thought of as \"family rules.\" Thementality conveys, \"This is the way we have alwaysdone it\" and provides a sense of security and stabilityfor family members that comes from predictability.These interactions may have to do with communica-tion, self-concept reinforcement, expressing expecta-tions, and handling differences (all of the behaviorsthat were discussed previously), but because they arerepetitive, and recur over time, they become the\"rules\" that govern patterns of interaction amongfamily members. Family rules are functional when they are work- able, are constructive, and promote the needs of allfamily members. They are dysfunctional when theybecome contradictory, self-defeating, and destruc-tive. Family therapists often find that individuals areunaware that dysfunctional family rules exist and mayvehemently deny their existence even when con-fronted with a specific behavioral interaction. Thedevelopment of dysfunctional interactional patternsoccurs through a habituation process and out of fearof change or reprisal or a lack of knowledge as tohow a given situation might be handled differently.Many are derived out of the parents' own growing-up experiences. Patterns of interaction that interfere with adaptive family functioning include the following. Patterns That Cause Emotional Discomfort Interactions can promote hurt and anger in familymembers. This is particularly true of emotions that in-dividuals feel uncomfortable expressing or are notpermitted (according to \"family rules\") to expressopenly. These interactional patterns include behav-iors such as never apologizing or never admitting thatone has made a mistake, forbidding flexibility in lifesituations (\"you must do it my way, or you will not doit at all\"), making statements that devalue the worthof others, or withholding statements that promote increased self-worth. EXAMPLE Priscilla and Bill had been discussing buying a new car but could not agree on the make or model to buy. One day, Billappeared at Priscilla's office over the lunch hour and said,\"Come outside and see our new car.\" In front of the building,Bill had parked a brand new sports car that he explained hehad purchased with their combined savings. Priscilla was furious, but kept quiet and proceeded to finish her workday.At home she expressed her anger to Bill for making the purchase without consulting her. Bill refused to apologize oradmit to making a mistake. They both remained cool andhardly spoke to each other for weeks. Patterns That Perpetuate or Intensify Problems Rather Than Solve Them When problems go unresolved over a long period of time, it sometimes appears to be easier just to ignorethem. If problems of the same nature occur, the ten-dency to ignore them then becomes the safe andpredictable pattern of interaction for dealing withthis type of situation. This may occur until the prob-lem intensifies to a point when it can no longer beignored. EXAMPLE Dan works hard in the automobile factory and demands peace and quiet from his family when he comes homefrom work. His children have learned over the years not to share their problems with him because they fear his explosive temper. Their mother attempts to handle un-pleasant situations alone as best she can. When son Ronwas expelled from school for being caught smoking pot forthe third time, Dan yelled, \"Why wasn't I told about thisbefore?\" Patterns That Are in Conflict With Each Other Some family rules may appear to be functional\u2014very workable and constructive\u2014on the surface, but inpractice may serve to destroy healthy interactional pat-terns. Boyer and Jeffrey (1994) describe the followingscenario as an example. EXAMPLE Dad insists that all members of the family eat dinner together every evening. No one may leave the table until everyone isfinished because dinnertime is one of the few times leftwhen the family can be together. Yet Dad frequently usesthe time to reprimand Bobby about his poor grades in math,to scold Ann for her sloppy room, or to make not-so-subtlegibes at Mom for \"spending all day on the telephone andnever getting anything accomplished.\" Family Climate The atmosphere or climate of a family is composed of a blend of the feelings and experiences that arethe result of family members' verbal and nonverbalsharing and interacting. A positive family climate isfounded on trust and is reflected in open communi-cation, joyfulness and laughter, expressions of caringand mutual respect, the valuing of each individualas unique, and a general feeling of security and well-being. In a dysfunctional family, the climate is evi-denced by tension, frustration, guilt, anger andresentment, depression, and despair.192 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch11_184-207 23/07/14 11:55 AM Page 192Therapeutic Modalities With Families The Family as a System General systems theory is a way of organizing thought according to the holistic perspective. A system is con-sidered greater than the sum of its parts. A system isconsidered dynamic and ever changing. A change inone part of the system causes a change in the otherparts of the system and in the system as a whole. Whenstudying families, it is helpful to conceptualize a hier-archy of systems. The family can be viewed as a system composed of various subsystems , such as the Eachof these subsystems is further divided into subsystemsof individuals. The family system is also a subsystemof a larger suprasystem, such as the neighborhood orcommunity. A schematic of a hierarchy of systems ispresented in Figure 11-1. Major Concepts Bowen (1978) did a great deal of work with familiesusing a systems approach. Bowen's theoretical approachto family therapy is composed of eight major concepts:(1) differentiation of self, (2) triangles, (3) nuclear fam-ily emotional process, (4) family projection process, (5) multigenerational transmission process, (6) siblingposition, (7) emotional cutoff, and (8) societal emo-tional process. Differentiation of Self Differentiation of self is the ability to define oneself asa separate being. The Bowen theory suggests that \"aperson with a well-differentiated self recognizes his [orher] realistic dependence on others, but can stay calmand clear headed enough in the face of conflict, criti-cism, and rejection to distinguish thinking rooted in a careful assessment of the facts from thinkingclouded by emotionality\" (Georgetown Family Center,2013a). The degree of differentiation of self can be viewed on a continuum from high levels, in which an indi-vidual manifests a clearly defined sense of self, to lowlevels, or undifferentiated, in which emotional fusionexists and the individual is unable to function sepa-rately from a relationship system. Healthy families en-courage differentiation, and the process of separationfrom the family ego mass is most pronounced duringthe ages of 2 to 5 and again between the ages of 13and 15. Families that do not understand the child'sneed to be different during these times may perceivetheir behavior as objectionable. Bowen (1971) used the term stuck-togetherness to de- scribe the family with the fused ego mass. When familyfusion occurs, none of the members has a true sense ofself as an independent individual. Boundaries betweenmembers are blurred, and the family becomes en-meshed without individual distinguishing characteris-tics. In this situation, family members can neither gaintrue intimacy nor separate and become individuals. Triangles The concept of triangles refers to a three-person emo- tional configuration that is considered the basic build-ing block of the family system. Bowen (1978) offersthe following description of triangles: The basic building block of any emotional system is the triangle. When emotional tension in a two-personsystem exceeds a certain level, it triangles in a thirdperson, permitting the tension to shift about withinthe triangle. Any two in the original triangle can adda new triangle. An emotional system is composed ofa series of interlocking triangles. (p. 306) Triangles are dysfunctional in that they offer relief from anxiety through diversion rather than through resolution of the issue. When stress develops in a two-person relationship, \"one or both partners will turnto someone else for sympathy or the conflict will drawCHAPTER 11 Intervention With Families 193 CORE CONCEPTS Family Therapy A type of therapeutic modality in which the focus of treatment is on the family as a unit. It represents aform of intervention in which members of a family areassisted to identify and change problematic, maladap-tive, self-defeating, repetitive relationship patterns(Goldenberg, Goldenberg, & Pelavin, 2011). A C DThe =AD =BC 23/07/14 11:55 AM Page 193in a third person to try to help\" (Nichols, 2010, p. 115). When the dynamics within a triangle stabi-lize, a fourth person may be brought in to form addi-tional triangles, in an effort to reduce tension. Thistriangulation can continue almost indefinitely as ex-tended family and people outside the family, includ-ing the family therapist, can become entangled in theprocess. The therapist working with families muststrive to remain \"de-triangled\" from this emotionalsystem. Nuclear Family Emotional Process The nuclear family emotional process describes thepatterns of emotional functioning in a single genera-tion. The nuclear family begins with a relationship be-tween two people who form a couple. The most openrelationship usually occurs during courtship, whenmost individuals choose partners with similar levels ofdifferentiation. The lower the level of differentiation,the greater the possibility of problems in the future.A degree of fusion occurs with permanent commit-ment. This fusion results in anxiety and must be dealtwith by each partner in an effort to maintain a healthydegree of differentiation. Family Projection Process Spouses who are unable to work through the undif-ferentiation or fusion that occurs with permanentcommitment may, when they become parents, projectthe resulting anxiety onto the children. This occur-rence is manifested as a father-mother-child triangle.These triangles are common and exist in various gra-dations of intensity in most families with children. The child who becomes the target of the projec- tion may be selected for various reasons: A particular child reminds one of the parents of anunresolved childhood issue. The child is of a particular gender or position inthe family. The child is born with special needs. The parent has a negative attitude about thepregnancy. This behavior is called scapegoating . It is harmful to both the child's emotional stability and his or herability to function outside the family. Goldenberg,Goldenberg, & Pelavin (2011) have stated: Scapegoated family members not only assume the role assigned them, but they may become so entrenchedin that role that they are unable to act otherwise. Par-ticularly in dysfunctional families, individuals may berepeatedly labeled as the 'bad child'\u2014incorrigible,destructive, unmanageable, troublesome\u2014and theyproceed to act accordingly. Scapegoated children areinducted into specific family roles, which over timebecome fixed and serve as the basis for chronic behav-ioral disturbance. (p. 432)Multigenerational Transmission Process Bowen (1978) described the multigenerational trans- mission process as the manner in which interactionalpatterns are transferred from one generation to an-other. Attitudes, values, beliefs, behaviors, and pat-terns of interaction are passed along from parents tochildren over many lifetimes, so that it becomes pos-sible to show in a family assessment that a certain be-havior has existed within a family through multiplegenerations. Genograms. A convenient way to plot a multigenera- tional assessment is with the use of genograms. Genograms offer the convenience of a great deal ofinformation in a small amount of space. They can alsobe used as teaching tools with the family itself. An over- all picture of the life of the family over several gener-ations can be conveyed, including roles that variousfamily members play as well as emotional distance be-tween specific individuals. Areas for change can beeasily identified. A sample genogram is presented inFigure 11-2. Sibling Position The view regarding sibling position profiles is that theposition one holds in a family influences the develop-ment of predictable personality characteristics. Forexample, firstborn children are thought to be perfec-tionistic, reliable, and conscientious; middle childrenare described as independent, loyal, and intolerant ofconflict; and youngest children tend to be charming,precocious, and gregarious (Leman, 2009). Bowenused this thesis to help determine levels of differenti-ation within a family and the possible direction of thefamily projection process. For example, if an oldestchild exhibits characteristics more representative ofa youngest child, there is evidence that this child maybe the product of triangulation. Sibling position pro-files are also used when studying multigenerationaltransmission processes and verifiable data are missingfor certain family members. Emotional Cutoff Emotional cutoff describes differentiation of self fromthe perception of the child. All individuals have somedegree of unresolved emotional attachment to their par-ents and the lower the level of differentiation, thegreater the degree of unresolved emotional attachment. Emotional cutoff has very little to do with how far away one lives from the family of origin. Individualswho live great distances from their parents can still beundifferentiated, whereas some individuals are emo-tionally cut off from their parents who live in the sametown or even the same neighborhood. Bowen (1976) suggests that emotional cutoff is the result of dysfunction within the family of origin in194 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch11_184-207 23/07/14 11:55 AM Page 194which fusion has occurred and that emotional cutoff promotes the same type of dysfunction in the new nu-clear family. He contends that maintaining some emo-tional contact with the family of origin promoteshealthy differentiation. Societal Emotional Process The Bowen theory views society as an emotional system. The concept of societal emotional processcompares society's response to stress to the same typeof response seen in individuals and families in re-sponse to emotional crisis: stress creates uncomfort-able levels of anxiety, that leads to hasty solutions,which add to the problems, and the cycle continues.This concept of Bowen's theory is explained as follows(Georgetown Family Center, 2013b): Human societies undergo periods of regression and progression in their history. The current regressionseems related to factors such as the population explo-sion, a sense of diminishing frontiers, and the deple-tion of natural resources. The \"symptoms\" of societalregression include a growth of crime and violence,an increasing divorce rate, a more litigious attitude,a greater polarization between racial groups, lessprincipled decision-making by leaders, the drugabuse epidemic, an increase in bankruptcy, and afocus on rights over responsibilities. Goal and Techniques of Therapy The goal of Bowen's systems approach to family therapy is to increase the level of differentiation of self, whileremaining in touch with the family system. The premiseis that intense emotional problems within the nuclearfamily can be resolved only by resolving undifferenti-ated relationships with the family of origin. Emphasis isgiven to the understanding of past relationships. The therapeutic role is that of \"coach\" or supervi- sor, and emotional involvement with the family is min-imized. Therapist techniques include: 1.Defining and clarifying the relationship betweenthe family members. 2.Helping family members develop one-to-one rela-tionships with each other and minimizing triangleswithin the system. 3.Teaching family members about the functioningof emotional systems. 4.Promoting differentiation by encouraging mem-bers to speak as individuals rather than as a fam-ily unit.CHAPTER 11 Intervention With Families 195 AMale Female Separated (s) OffspringConflictual relationship Miscarriageor abortion Adopted (boy)PregnantUnmarried relationship Overclose relationshipMarried (m) Divorced (d) Twins (boys) DeathKEY 507172 33 52 52 23 23 2116 16 32 321956 CA 1945 CA1976 MI 1968 CA 1985 MI1983 CA1982 MI1984 CVA 43A 42 Abortion 1989 (m) 1958 (d) 1960(m) 1961 (s) 1991 ( Patient )8692 100 80 6573 NOTE: Include ages and dates of significant events when known. FIGURE 11-2 Sample genogram.4092_Ch11_184-207 23/07/14 11:55 AM Page 195The Structural Model Structural family therapy is associated with a model developed by Minuchin (1974). In this model, thefamily is viewed as a social system within which the in-dividual lives and to which the individual must adapt.The individual both contributes and responds tostresses within the family. Major Concepts Systems The structural model views the family as a system. Thestructure of the family system is founded on a set of invisible principles that influence the interactionamong family members. These principles concernhow, when, and with whom to relate, and are estab-lished over time and through repeated transactions,until they become rules that govern the conduct ofvarious family members (Goldenberg & Goldenberg,2013). Transactional Patterns Transactional patterns are the rules that have beenestablished over time that organize the ways inwhich family members relate to one another. A hi-erarchy of authority is one example of a transac-tional pattern. Usually, parents have a higher levelof authority in a family than the children, soparental behavior reflects this role. A balance of au-thority may exist between husband and wife, or onemay reflect a higher level than the other. These pat-terns of behavioral expectations differ from familyto family and may trace their origin over genera-tions of family negotiations. Subsystems Minuchin (1974) describes subsystems as smaller elements that make up the larger family system. Sub-systems can be individuals or can consist of two ormore persons united by gender, relationship, gener-ation, interest, or purpose. A family member may be-long to several subsystems at the same time, in whichhe or she may experience different levels of powerand require different types of skills. For example, ayoung man has a different level of power and a differ-ent set of expectations in his father-son subsystemthan in a subsystem with his younger brother. Boundaries Boundaries define the level of participation and in- teraction among subsystems. Boundaries are appro-priate when they permit appropriate contact withothers while preventing excessive interference.Clearly defined boundaries promote adaptive func-tioning. Maladaptive functioning can occur whenboundaries are rigid or diffuse.A rigid boundary is characterized by decreased communication and lack of support and responsive-ness. Rigid boundaries prevent a subsystem (familymember or subgroup) from achieving appropriatecloseness or interaction with others in the system.Rigid boundaries promote disengagement, or ex- treme separateness, among family members. A diffuse boundary is characterized by dependency and overinvolvement. Diffuse boundaries interferewith adaptive functioning because of the overinvest-ment, overinvolvement, and lack of differentiation between certain subsystems. Diffuse boundaries pro-mote enmeshment , or exaggerated connectedness, among family members. EXAMPLE Sally and Jim have been married for 12 years, during which time they have tried without success to have children. Six months ago they were thrilled to have the opportunity to adopt a 5-year-old girl, Annie. Since both Sally and Jimhave full-time teaching jobs, Annie stays with her maternalgrandmother, Krista, during the day after she gets home fromhalf-day kindergarten. At first, Annie was a polite and obedient child. However, in the last few months, she has become insolent and oppo-sitional, and has temper tantrums when she cannot have herway. Sally and Krista agree that Annie should have whatevershe desires and should not be punished for her behavior.Jim believes that discipline is necessary, but Sally and Kristarefuse to enforce any guidelines he tries to establish. Annieis aware of this discordance and manipulates it to her full advantage. In this situation, diffuse boundaries exist among the Sally-Krista-Annie subsystems. They have become enmeshed. They have also established a rigid bound-ary against Jim, disengaging him from the system. Goal and Techniques of Therapy The goal of structural family therapy is to facilitatechange in the family structure . Family structure is changed with modification of the family \"princi-ples\" or transactional patterns that are contributingto dysfunction within the family. The family isviewed as the unit of therapy, and all members arecounseled together. Little, if any, time is spent ex-ploring past experiences. The focus of structuraltherapy is on the present. Therapist techniques include the following: Joining the Family. The therapist must become a part of the family if restructuring is to occur. Thetherapist joins the family but maintains a leader-ship position. He or she may at different times joinvarious subsystems within the family, but ultimatelyincludes the entire family system as the target of intervention.196 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch11_184-207 23/07/14 11:55 AM Page 196Evaluating the Family Structure. Even though a family may come for therapy because of the behav- ior of one family member (the identified patient),the family as a unit is considered problematic. Thefamily structure is evaluated by assessing transac-tional patterns, system flexibility and potential forchange, boundaries, family developmental stage,and role of the identified patient within the system. Restructuring the Family. An alliance or contract for therapy is established with the family. By becom-ing an actual part of the family, the therapist is ableto manipulate the system and facilitate the circum-stances and experiences that can lead to structuralchange. The Strategic Model The strategic model of family therapy uses the inter-actional or communications approach. Communica-tion theory is viewed as the foundation for this model.Communication is the actual transmission of informa-tion among individuals. All behavior sends a message,so all behavior in the presence of two or more indi-viduals is communication. In this model, families con-sidered to be functional are open systems where clearand precise messages, congruent with the situation,are sent and received. Healthy communication pat-terns promote nurturance and individual self-worth.Dysfunctional families are viewed as partially closedsystems in which communication is vague, and mes-sages are often inconsistent and incongruent with thesituation. Destructive patterns of communicationtend to inhibit healthful nurturing and decrease in-dividual feelings of self-worth. Major Concepts Double-Bind Communication Double-bind communication occurs when a state-ment is made and succeeded by a contradictorystatement. It also occurs when a statement is madeaccompanied by nonverbal expression that is incon-sistent with the verbal communication. These incom-patible communications can interfere with egodevelopment in an individual and promote mistrustof all communications. Double-bind communicationoften results in a \"damned if I do and damned if Idon't\" situation. EXAMPLE A mother freely gives and receives hugs and kisses from her 6-year-old son some of the time, while at other times shepushes him away saying, \"Big boys don't act like that.\" Thelittle boy receives a conflicting message and is presented withan impossible dilemma: \"To please my mother I must notshow her that I love her, but if I do not show her that I loveher, I'm afraid I will lose her.\"Pseudomutuality and Pseudohostility A healthy functioning individual is able to relate to other people while still maintaining a sense of sepa-rate identity. In a dysfunctional family, patterns of in-teraction may be reflected in the remoteness orcloseness of relationships. These relationships may re-flect erratic interaction (i.e., sometimes remote andsometimes close) or inappropriate interaction (i.e.,excessive closeness or remoteness). Pseudomutuality and pseudohostility are seen as collective defenses against the reality of the underly-ing meaning of the relationships in a dysfunctionalfamily system. Pseudomutuality is characterized by a facade of mutual regard. Emotional investment is directed at maintaining outward representation of reciprocal fulfillment rather than in the relationship itself. The style of relating is fixed and rigid, andpseudomutuality allows family members to deny un-derlying fears of separation and hostility. EXAMPLE Janet, age 16, is the only child of State Senator J. and his wife. Janet was recently involved in a joyriding experiencewith a group of teenagers her parents call \"the wrongcrowd.\" In family therapy, Mrs. J. says, \"We have always beena close family. I can't imagine why she is doing these things.\"Senator J. states, \"I don't know another colleague who hasa family that is as close as mine.\" Janet responds, \"Yes, weare close. I just don't see my parents very much. Dad hasbeen in politics since I was a baby, and Mom is always withhim. I wish I could spend more time with them. But we area close family.\" Pseudohostility is also a fixed and rigid style of re- lating, but the facade being maintained is that of a state of chronic conflict and alienation among familymembers. This relationship pattern allows familymembers to deny underlying fears of tenderness andintimacy. EXAMPLE Jack, 14, and his sister Jill, 15, will have nothing to do with each other. When they are together they can agree on noth-ing, and the barrage of \"put-downs\" is constant. This behaviorreflects pseudohostility used by individuals who are afraid toreveal feelings of intimacy. Schism and Skew Lidz, Cornelison, Fleck, and Terry (1957) observed two patterns within families that relate to a dysfunc-tional marital dyad. A marital schism is defined as \"a state of severe chronic disequilibrium and discord,with recurrent threats of separation.\" Each partnerundermines the other, mutual trust is absent, and acompetition exists for closeness with the children.Often a partner establishes an alliance with his orCHAPTER 11 Intervention With Families 1974092_Ch11_184-207 23/07/14 11:55 AM Page 197her parent against the spouse. Children lack appro- priate role models. Marital skew describes a relation- ship in which there is lack of equal partnership. Onepartner dominates the relationship and the otherpartner. The marriage remains intact as long as thepassive partner allows the domination to continue.Children also lack role models when a marital skewexists. Goal and Techniques of Therapy The goal of strategic family therapy is to createchange in destructive behavior and communicationpatterns among family members. The identified fam-ily problem is the unit of therapy, and all family mem- bers need not be counseled together. In fact, strategictherapists may prefer to see subgroups or individualsseparately in an effort to achieve problem resolution.Therapy is oriented in the present and the therapistassumes full responsibility for devising an effectivestrategy for family change. Therapeutic techniques in-clude the following: Paradoxical Intervention. A paradox can be called a contradiction in therapy, or \"prescribing thesymptom.\" With paradoxical intervention , the ther- apist requests that the family continue to engagein the behavior that they are trying to change. Al-ternatively, specific directions may be given for con-tinuing the defeating behavior. For example, acouple that regularly engages in insulting shoutingmatches is instructed to have one of these encoun-ters on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 8:30 to 9 p.m.Boyer and Jeffrey (1994) explained this techniquein the following manner: A family using its maladaptive behavior to control or punish other people loses control of the situationwhen it finds itself continuing the behavior under atherapist's direction and being praised for followinginstructions. If the family disobeys the therapist's in-struction, the price it pays is sacrificing the old behav-ior pattern and experiencing more satisfying ways ofinteracting with one another. A family that maintainsit has no control over its behavior, or whose memberscontend that others must change before they canthemselves, suddenly finds itself unable to defendsuch statements. (p. 125) Reframing. Goldenberg and associates (2011) de- scribe reframing as \"relabeling problematic behav- ior by viewing it in a new, more positive light that emphasizes its good intention.\" Therefore, with re-framing, the behavior may not actually change, but the consequences of the behavior may change, be- cause of a change in the meaning attached to thebehavior. This technique is sometimes referred toas positive reframing.EXAMPLE Tom has a construction job and makes a comfortable living for his wife, Sue, and their two children. Tom and Sue havebeen arguing a lot and came to the therapist for counseling.Sue says Tom frequently drinks too much and is often lategetting home from work. Tom counters, \"I never used todrink on my way home from work, but Sue started complain-ing to me the minute I walked in the door about being sodirty and about tracking dirt and mud on 'her nice, cleanfloors.' It was the last straw when she made me undress be-fore I came in the house and leave my dirty clothes andshoes in the garage. I thought a man's home was his castle.Well, I sure don't feel like a king. I need a few stiff drinks toface her nagging!\" The therapist used reframing to attempt change by helping Sue to view the situation in a more positive light. He suggested to Sue that she try to change herthinking by focusing on how much her husband mustlove her and her children to work as hard as he does.He asked her to focus on the dirty clothes and shoesas symbols of his love for them and to respond to his\"dirty\" arrivals home with greater affection. This pos-itive reframing set the tone for healing and for in-creased intimacy within the marital relationship. The Evolution of Family Therapy Bowen's family theory and the structural and strategicmodels are sometimes referred to as basic models offamily therapy. Goldenberg and Goldenberg (2013)state: While noteworthy differences continue to exist in the theoretical assumptions each school of thoughtmakes about the nature and origin of psychologicaldysfunction, in what precisely they look for in under-standing family patterns, and in their strategies fortherapeutic intervention, in practice the trend todayis toward eclecticism and integration in family ther-apy. (p. 165) Nichols (2010) suggested that contemporary fam- ily therapists \"borrow from each other's arsenal of techniques.\" The basic models described here haveprovided a foundation for the progression andgrowth of the discipline of family therapy. Examplesof newer models include the following: Narrative therapy: Narrative therapy is an ap- proach to treatment that emphasizes the role ofthe stories people construct about their experi-ence. (Nichols, 2010, p. 463) Feminist family therapy: This form of family therapy employs a collaborative, egalitarian, nonsexist inter-vention, applicable to both men and women, ad-dressing family gender roles, patriarchal attitudes,198 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch11_184-207 23/07/14 11:55 AM Page 198and social and economic inequalities in male- female relationships. (Goldenberg & Goldenberg,2013, p. 518) Social constructionist therapy: Social construction- ist therapy shifts attention away from an inspectionof the origin or the exact nature of a family's pre-senting problems to an examination of the stories(interpretations, explanations, theories about rela-tionships) family members have told themselvesthat account for how they have lived their lives. So-cial constructionist therapists are particularly inter-ested in expanding clients' rigid and inflexibleviews of the world (Goldenberg & Goldenberg,2013, p. 375). Psychoeducational family therapy: This type of fam- ily therapy emphasizes educating family membersto help them understand and cope with a seriouslydisturbed family member (Nichols, 2010, p. 464). The goal of most family therapy models is to pro- vide the opportunity for change based on familymembers' perceptions of available options. The basicdifferences among models arise in how they go aboutachieving this goal. Goldenberg & Goldenberg(2013) stated: Regardless of procedures, all attempt to create a ther- apeutic environment conducive to self-examination,to reduce discomfort and conflict, to mobilize familyresilience and empowerment, and to help the familymembers improve their overall functioning. (p. 483) The Nursing Process\u2014A Case Study Assessment Wright and Leahey (2013) have developed the Calgary Family Assessment Model (CFAM), a multidimen-sional model originally adapted from a framework de-veloped by Tomm and Sanders (1983). The CFAMconsists of three major categories: structural, develop-mental, and functional. Wright and Leahey (2013)state: Each category contains several subcategories. It is im- portant for each nurse to decide which subcategoriesare relevant and appropriate to explore and assess witheach family at each point in time\u2014that is, not all sub-categories need to be assessed at a first meeting with afamily, and some subcategories need never be assessed.If the nurse uses too many subcategories, he or shemay become overwhelmed by all the data. If the nurseand the family discuss too few subcategories, each mayhave a distorted view of the family's strengths or prob-lems and the family situation. (pp. 51-52) A diagram of the CFAM is presented in Figure 11-3. The three major categories are listed, along with thesubcategories for assessment under each. This diagram is used to assess the Marino family, a case study pre-sented in Box 11-1. Structural Assessment A graphic representation of the Marino family struc-ture is presented in the genogram in Figure 11-4. Internal Structure The Marino family consists of a husband, wife, andtheir biological son and daughter who live togetherin the same home. They conform to the traditionalgender roles. John is the eldest child from a ratherlarge family, and Nancy has no siblings. In this family,their son, Peter, is the firstborn and his sister, Anna,is 2 years younger. Neither spousal, sibling, norspousal-sibling subsystems appear to be close in clearly conflictual. Problematicsubsystems include John-Nancy, John-Nancy-children,and Nancy-Ethyl. The subsystem boundaries are quiterigid, and the family members appear to be emotion-ally disengaged from one another. External Structure This family has ties to extended family, although theavailability of support is questionable. Nancy's parentsoffered little emotional support to her as a developingchild. They never approved of her marriage to Johnand still remain distant and cold. John's family con-sists of a father, mother, two brothers, and two sisters.They are warm and supportive most of the time, butcultural influences interfere with their understandingof this current situation. At this time, the Marino fam-ily is probably receiving the most support from health-care professionals who have intervened during Anna'shospitalization. Context John is a second-generation Italian American. Hisfamily of origin is large, warm, and supportive. How-ever, John's parents believe that family problemsshould be dealt with in the family, and disapprove ofbringing \"strangers\" in to hear what they consider tobe private information. They believe that Anna's phys-ical condition should be stabilized, and then sheshould be discharged to deal with family problems athome. John and Nancy were reared in different social classes. In John's family, money was not available toseek out professional help for every problem thatarose. Italian cultural beliefs promote the provisionof help within the nuclear and extended family net-work. If outside counseling is sought, it is often withthe family priest. John and Nancy did not seek thistype of counseling because they no longer attendchurch regularly.CHAPTER 11 Intervention With Families 1994092_Ch11_184-207 23/07/14 11:55 AM Page 199200 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Family assessmentStructural Developmental FunctionalInternal External Context Stages Tasks Attachments Instrumental ExpressiveFamily composition Gender Rank order Subsystems Boundaries Extended family Larger systems EthnicityRaceSocial classReligion and/or spirituality Environment Activities of daily living Emotional communication Verbal communication Nonverbal communication Circular communicationProblem-solvingRolesInfluence and powerBeliefsAlliances/coalitionsSexual orientation FIGURE 11-3 Branching diagram of the Calgary Family Assessment Model (CFAM).

BOX 11-1 The Marino Family\u2014A Case Study John and Nancy Marino have been married for 19 years. They have a 17-year-old son, Peter, and a 15-year-old daugh-ter, Anna. Anna was recently hospitalized for taking an over-dose of fluoxetine, her mother's prescription antidepressant.The family is attending family therapy sessions while Anna isin the hospital. Anna states, \"I just couldn't take the fightinganymore! Our house is an awful place to be. Everyone hateseach other, and everyone is unhappy. Dad drinks too muchand Mom is always sick! Peter stays away as much as he canand I don't blame him. I would too if I had someplace tostay. I just thought I'd be better off dead.\" John Marino, age 44, is the oldest of five children. His father, Paulo, age 66, is a first-generation Italian Americanwhose parents emigrated from Italy in the early 1900s. Pauloretired last year after 32 years as a cutter in a meatpackingplant. His wife, Carla, age 64, has never worked outside thehome. John and his siblings all worked at minimum-wagejobs during high school, and John and his two brothersworked their way through college. His two sisters marriedyoung, and both are housewives and mothers. John was ableto go to law school with the help of loans, grants, and schol-arships. He has held several positions since graduation andis currently employed as a corporate attorney for a large aircraft company. Nancy, age 43, is the only child of Sam and Ethyl Jones. Sam, age 67, inherited a great deal of money from his familywho had been in the shipping business. He is currently thechief executive officer of this business. Ethyl, also 67, was anaspiring concert pianist when she met Sam. She chose togive up her career for marriage and family, although Nancy4092_Ch11_184-207 23/07/14 11:55 AM Page 200CHAPTER 11 Intervention With Families 201 BOX 11-1 The Marino Family\u2014A Case Study\u2014cont'd believes her mother always resented doing so. Nancy was reared in an affluent lifestyle. She attended private boardingschools as she was growing up and chose an exclusive col-lege in the East to pursue her interest in art. She studied inParis during her junior year. Nancy states that she was neveremotionally close to her parents. They traveled a great deal,and she spent much of her time under the supervision of a nanny. Nancy's parents were opposed to her marrying John. They perceived John's family to be below their social status. Nancy,on the other hand, loved John's family. She felt them to bevery warm and loving, so unlike what she was used to in herown family. Her family is Protestant and also disapproved ofher marrying in the Roman Catholic Church. FAMILY DYNAMICS As their marriage progressed, Nancy's health became veryfragile. She had continued her ar tistic pursuits but seemed to achieve little satisfaction from it. She tried to keep in touchwith her parents but often felt spurned by them. They trav-eled a great deal and often did not even inform her of theirwhereabouts. They were not present at the birth of her chil-dren. She experiences many aches and pains and spendsmany days in bed. She sees several physicians, who haveprescribed various pain medications, antianxiety agents, andantidepressants but can find nothing organically wrong. Fiveyears ago she learned that John had been having an affairwith his secretary. He promised to break it off and fired thesecretary, but Nancy has had difficulty trusting him since thattime. She brings up his infidelity whenever they have an ar-gument, which is more and more often lately. When he ishome, John drinks, usually until he falls asleep. Peter fre-quently comes home smelling of alcohol and a number oftimes has been clearly intoxicated. When Nancy called her parents to tell them that Anna was in the hospital, Ethyl replied, \"I'm sorry to hear that, dear. Wecertainly never had any of those kinds of problems on ourside of the family. But I'm sure everything will be okay nowthat you are getting help. Please give our love to your family.Your father and I are leaving for Europe on Saturday and willbe gone for 6 weeks.\" Although more supportive, John's parents view this situa- tion as somewhat shameful for the family. John's dad re-sponded, \"We had hard times when you were growing up,but never like this. We always took care of our own problems.We never had to tell a bunch of strangers about them. It'snot right to air your dirty laundry in public. Bring Anna home.Give her your love and she will be okay.\" In therapy, Nancy blames John's drinking and his admitted affair for all their problems. John states that he drinks be-cause it is the only way he can tolerate his wife's complainingabout his behavior and her many illnesses. Peter is very quietmost of the time but says he will be glad when he graduatesin 4 months and can leave \"this looney bunch of people.\"Anna cries as she listens to her family in therapy and says,\"Nothing's ever going to change.\" In Nancy's family, money was available to obtain the very best professional help at the first sign of trou- ble. However, Nancy's parents refused to acknowl-edge, both then and now, that any difficulty everexisted in their family situation. The Marino family lives comfortably on John's salary as a corporate attorney. They have health insur-ance and access to any referrals that are deemed nec-essary. They are well educated but have beenattempting to deny the dysfunctional dynamics thatexist in their family. Developmental Assessment The Marino family falls within the \"family with ado-lescents\" stage of McGoldrick and associates' familylife cycle. In this stage, parents are expected to re-spond to adolescents' requests for increasing inde-pendence, while being available to continue to fulfilldependency needs. They may also be required to pro-vide additional support to aging grandparents. Thismay be a time when parents may also begin to reex-amine their own marital and career issues. The Marino family is not fulfilling the depend- ency needs of its adolescents; in fact, they may beestablishing premature independence. The parentsare absorbed in their own personal problems to theexclusion of their children. Peter responds to thisneglect by staying away as much as possible, drink-ing with his friends, and planning to leave home atthe first opportunity. Anna's attempted suicide is acry for help. She has needs that are unfulfilled byher parents, and this crisis situation may be re-quired for them to recognize that a problem exists.This may be the time when they begin to reexaminetheir unresolved marital issues. Extended family arestill self-supporting and do not require assistancefrom John and Nancy at this time. Functional Assessment Instrumental Functioning This family has managed to adjust to the maladaptivefunctioning in an effort to meet physical activities ofdaily living. They subsist on fast food, or sometimesNancy or Anna will prepare a meal. Seldom do theysit down at table to eat together. Nancy must take painmedication or sedatives to sleep. John usually drinkshimself to sleep. Anna and Peter take care of theirown needs independently. Often they do not even see4092_Ch11_184-207 23/07/14 11:55 AM Page 201202 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Paulo 66Carla 64Sam 67Ethyl 67 John Symptom DisorderHousewife Meat Cutter (ret.)

Each manages to do fairly well in school. Peter says, \"I don't intend to ruinmy chances of getting out of this hell hole as soon asI can!\" Expressive Functioning John and Nancy Marino argue a great deal aboutmany topics. This family seldom shows affection toone another. Nancy and Anna express sadness withtears, whereas John and Peter have a tendency towithdraw or turn to alcohol when experiencing un-happiness. Nancy somaticizes her internal pain, andnumbs this pain with medication. Anna internalizedher emotional pain until it became unbearable. A no-table lack of constructive communication is evident. This family is unable to solve its problems effec- tively. In fact, it is unlikely that it has even identifiedits problems, which undoubtedly have been in exis-tence for a long while. These problems have only re-cently been revealed in light of Anna's suicideattempt. Diagnosis The following nursing diagnoses were identified forthe Marino family: Interrupted family processes related to unsuccess- ful achievement of family developmental tasks anddysfunctional coping strategies evidenced by inabil-ity of family members to relate to each other in anadaptive manner; adolescents' unmet dependencyneeds; inability of family members to express awide range of feelings and to send and receiveclear messages. Disabled family coping related to highly ambiva- lent family relationships and lack of support evi-denced by inability to problem-solve; each membercopes in response to dysfunctional family processeswith destructive behavior (John drinks, Nancy so-maticizes, Peter drinks and withdraws, and Annaattempts suicide). Outcome Identification The following criteria were identified as measurementof outcomes in counseling of the Marino family: Family members will demonstrate effective com-munication patterns. Family members will express feelings openly andhonestly. Family members will establish more adaptive cop-ing strategies. Family members will be able to identify destructivepatterns of functioning and problem-solve them effectively.4092_Ch11_184-207 subsystems will become moreclearly defined. Family members will establish stronger bonds withextended family. Planning/Implementation The Marino family will undoubtedly require manymonths of outpatient therapy. It is even likely thateach member will need individual psychotherapy inaddition to the family therapy. Once Anna has beenstabilized physiologically and is discharged from thehospital, family/individual therapy will begin. Several strategies for family therapy have been dis- cussed in this chapter. As mentioned previously, fam-ily therapy has a strong theoretical framework and isperformed by individuals with specialized educationin family theory and process. Some advanced practicenurses possess the credentials required to performfamily therapy. It is important, however, for all nursesto have some knowledge about working with families,to be able to assess family interaction, and to recog-nize when problems exist. Some interventions with the Marino family might include the following: 1.Create a therapeutic environment that fosterstrust, and in which the family members can feelsafe and comfortable. The nurse can promote thistype of environment by being empathetic, listen-ing actively (see Chapter 8), accepting feelings andattitudes, and being nonjudgmental. 2.Promote effective communication bya. Seeking clarification when vague and general- ized statements are made (e.g., Anna states, \"Ijust want my family to be like my friends' fami-lies.\" Nurse: \"Anna, would you please explain tothe group exactly what you mean by that?\"). b . Setting clear limits (e.g., \"Peter, it is okay to state when you are angry about something thathas been said. It is not okay to throw the chairagainst the wall.\"). c. Being consistent and fair (e.g., \"I encourage each of you to contribute to the group processand to respect one another's opportunity tocontribute equally.\"). d. Addressing each individual clearly and directly and encouraging family members to do thesame (e.g., \"Nancy, I think it would be more ap-propriate if you directed that statement to Johninstead of to me.\"). 3.Identify patterns of interaction that interfere withsuccessful problem resolution. For example, Johnasks Nancy many \"Why?\" questions that keep heron the defensive. He criticizes her for \"always beingsick.\" Nancy responds by frequently remindingJohn of his infidelity. Peter and Anna interrupt each other and their parents when the level of con-flict reaches a certain point. Provide examples ofmore appropriate ways to communicate that canimprove interpersonal relations and lead to moreeffective patterns of interaction. 4.Help the Marino family to identify problems thatmay necessitate change. Encourage each memberto discuss a family process that he or she would liketo change. As a group, promote discussion of whatmust take place for change to occur and alloweach member to explore whether he or she couldrealistically cooperate with the necessary require- ments for change. 5.As the problem-solving process progresses, encour-age all family members to express honest feelings.Address each one directly, \"John (Nancy, Peter, Anna), how do you feel about what the others aresuggesting?\" Ensure that all participants under-stand that each member may express honest feel-ings (e.g., anger, sadness, fear, anxiety, guilt,disgust, helplessness) without criticism, judgment,or fear of personal reprisal. 6.Avoid becoming triangled in the family emotionalsystem. Remain neutral and objective. Do not takesides in family disagreements; instead, provide al-ternative explanations and suggestions (e.g., \"Per- haps we can look at that situation in a different light . . .\"). 7.Reframe vague problem descriptions into ones forwhich resolution is more realistic. For example,rather than defining the problem as \"We don' t love each other any more,\" the problem could bedefined as \"We do not spend time together in fam-ily activities any more.\" This definition evolvesfrom the family members' description of what theymean by the more general problem description. 8.Discuss present coping strategies. Encourage eachfamily member to describe how he or she copeswith stress and with the adversity within the family.Explore each member' s possible contribution to the family's problems. Encourage family membersto discuss possible solutions among themselves. 9.Identify community resources that may assist indi-vidual family members and provide support for es-tablishing more adaptive coping mechanisms. Forexample, Alcoholics Anonymous for John; Al-Anon for Nancy; and Alateen for Peter and Anna.Other groups that may be of assistance to this fam-ily include Emotions Anonymous, Parent's Sup-port Group, Families Helping Families, MarriageEnrichment, Parents of T eenagers, and We Saved Our Marriage (WESOM). Local self-help networksoften provide a directory of resources within spe-cific communities.CHAPTER 11 Intervention With Families 2034092_Ch11_184-207 23/07/14 11:55 AM Page 20310.Discuss with the family the possible need for psy- chotherapy for individual members. Providenames of therapists who would perform assess-ments to determine individual needs. Encouragefollow-through with appointments. 11.Assist family members in planning leisure time ac-tivities together. This could include time to playtogether , exercise together, or engage in a shared project. Evaluation Evaluation is the final step in the nursing process. Inthis step, progress toward attainment of outcomes ismeasured. 1.Do family members demonstrate effective patternsof communication? 2.Can family members express feelings openly andhonestly without fear of reprisal? 3.Can family members accept their own personalcontribution to the family's problems? 4.Can individual members identify maladaptive cop-ing methods and express a desire to improve? 5.Do family members work together to solve problems? 6.Can family members identify resources in the com-munity from which they can seek assistance andsupport? 7.Do family members express a desire to formstronger bonds with the extended family? 8.Are family members willing to seek individual psychotherapy? 9.Are family members pursuing shared activities? Summary and Key Points Nurses must have sufficient knowledge of familyfunctioning to assess family interaction and recog-nize when problems exist. McGoldrick, Carter, and Garcia-Preto (2011) iden-tify stages that describe the family life cycle. Theyinclude the following: The single young adult The family joined through marriage/union The family with young childrenThe family with adolescents The family launching children and moving on inmidlife The family in later life (late middle age to endof life) Tasks of families experiencing divorce and remar-riage, and those that vary according to culturalnorms were also presented. Families are assessed as functional or dysfunctionalbased on the following six elements: communica-tion, self-concept reinforcement, family members'expectations, handling differences, family interac-tional patterns, and family climate. Bowen viewed the family as a system that was com-posed of various subsystems. His theoretical ap-proach to family therapy includes eight majorconcepts: differentiation of self, triangles, nuclearfamily emotional process, family projection process,multigenerational transmission process, sibling po-sition, emotional cutoff, and societal emotionalprocess. In the structural model of family therapy, the fam-ily is viewed as a social system within which the in-dividual lives and to which the individual mustadapt. In the strategic model of family therapy, communi-cation is viewed as the foundation of functioning.Functional families are open systems where clearand precise messages are sent and received. Dys-functional families are viewed as partially closed sys-tems in which communication is vague, andmessages are often inconsistent and incongruentwith the situation. Many family therapists today follow an eclectic ap-proach and incorporate concepts from severalmodels into their practices. The nursing process is used as a framework for as-sessing, diagnosing, planning, implementing, andevaluating care to families who require assistanceto maintain or regain adaptive functioning.204 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Additional info available at www.davisplus.com4092_Ch11_184-207 23/07/14 11:55 AM Page 204CHAPTER 11 Intervention With Families 205 205 Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

The conditions necessary for a therapeu-tic environment are discussed, and the roles of thevarious health-care workers within the interdiscipli-nary team are delineated. An interpretation of thenurse's role in milieu therapy is included.HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT Please read the chapter and answer the following questions: 1.How are unit rules established in a therapeutic community setting? 2.Which member of the interdisciplinary treat-ment team has a focus on rehabilitationand vocational training?3.How are client responsibilities assigned inthe therapeutic community setting? 4.Which member of the interdisciplinary treatment team serves as leader?4092_Ch12_208-216 24/07/14 5:25 PM Page 208Echternacht (2001) suggested that more emphasis should be placed on unstructured components of mi- lieu therapy. She described the unstructured compo-nents as a multitude of complex interactions betweenclients, staff, and visitors that occur around the clock.Echternacht called these interactions \"fluid groupwork.\" They involve spontaneous opportunitieswithin the milieu environment for the psychiatricnurse to provide \"on-the-spot therapeutic interven-tions designed to enhance socialization competencyand interpersonal relationship awareness. Emphasisis on social skills and activities in the context of in-terpersonal interactions\" (p. 40). With fluid groupwork, the nurse applies psychotherapeutic knowl-edge and skills to brief clinical encounters that occurspontaneously in the therapeutic milieu setting.Echternacht (2001) believes that by using these tech-niques, nurses can \"reclaim their milieu therapyfunctions in the midst of a changing health care environment\" (p. 40). Many of the original concepts of milieu therapy are presented in this chapter. It is important to rememberthat a number of modifications to these concepts havebeen applied in practice for use in a variety of settings. Basic Assumptions Skinner (1979) outlined seven basic assumptions onwhich a therapeutic community is based: 1. The Health in Each Individual Is to be Realized and Encouraged to Grow .All individuals are con- sidered to have strengths as well as limitations.These healthy aspects of the individual are identi-fied and serv e as a foundation for growth in the personality and in the ability to function moreadaptively and productively in all aspects of life. 2. Every Interaction Is an Opportunity for Therapeu- tic Intervention. Within this structured setting, it is virtually impossible to avoid interpersonal interac-tion. The ideal situation exists for clients to improvecommunication and relationship developmentskills. Learning occurs from immediate feedback ofpersonal perceptions. 3 . The Client Owns His or Her Own Environment. Clients make decisions and solve problems relatedto government of the unit. In this way, personal needs for autonomy as well as needs that pertainto the group as a whole are fulfilled. 4. Each Client Owns His or Her Behavior. Each indi- vidual within the therapeutic community is ex-pected to take responsibility for his or her ownbehavior. 5. Peer Pressure is a Useful and a Powerful Tool. Be- havioral group norms are established throughpeer pressure. Feedback is direct and frequent, soMilieu, Defined The word milieu is French for \"middle.\" The English translation of the word is \"surroundings, or environ-ment.\" In psychiatry, therapy involving the milieu, orenvironment, may be called milieu therapy, therapeu-tic community, or the therapeutic environment. Thegoal of milieu therapy is to manipulate the environ-ment so that all aspects of the client's hospital expe-rience are considered therapeutic. Within thistherapeutic community setting the client is expectedto learn adaptive coping, interaction, and relation-ship skills that can be generalized to other aspects ofhis or her life.CHAPTER 12 Milieu Therapy\u2014The Therapeutic Community 209 CORE CONCEPTS Milieu Therapy A scientific structuring of the environment in order to effect behavioral changes and to improve the psycho-logical health and functioning of the individual (Skinner, 1979). Current Status of the Therapeutic Community Milieu therapy came into its own during the 1960s through early 1980s. During this period, psychiatricinpatient treatment provided sufficient time to imple-ment programs of therapy that were aimed at socialrehabilitation. Nursing's focus of establishing inter-personal relationships with clients fit well within thisconcept of therapy. Patients were encouraged to beactive participants in their therapy, and individual autonomy was emphasized. The current focus of inpatient psychiatric care has changed. Hall (1995) stated: Care in inpatient psychiatric facilities can now be characterized as short and biologically based. Bythe time patients have stabilized enough to benefitfrom the socialization that would take place in a milieu as treatment program, they [often] have beendischarged. (p. 51) Although strategies for milieu therapy are still used, they have been modified to conform to the short-term approach to care or to outpatient treat-ment programs. Some programs (e.g., those for children and adolescents, clients with substance ad-dictions, and geriatric clients) have successfullyadapted the concepts of milieu Page 209that behaving in a manner acceptable to the other members of the community becomes essential. 6. Inappropriate Behaviors Are Dealt With as They Occur. Individuals examine the significance of their behavior, look at how it affects other people, and discuss more appropriate ways of behaving incertain situations. 7. Restrictions and Punishment Are to Be Avoided. Destructive behaviors can usually be controlledwith group discussion. However, if an individual re- quires external controls, temporary isolation ispreferred over lengthy restriction or other harshconsequences. Conditions That Promote a Therapeutic Community In a therapeutic community setting, everything thathappens to the client, or within the client's environ-ment, is considered to be part of the treatment pro-gram. The community setting is the foundation forthe program of treatment. Community factors\u2014suchas social interactions, the physical structure of thetreatment setting, and schedule of activities\u2014maygenerate negative responses from some clients. Thesestressful experiences are used as examples to help theclient learn how to manage stress more adaptively inreal-life situations. Under what conditions, then, is a hospital environ- ment considered therapeutic? A number of criteriahave been identified: 1. Basic Physiological Needs Are Fulfilled. As Maslow (1968) suggested, individuals do not move to higherlevels of functioning until the basic biological needsfor food, water, air , sleep, exercise, elimination, shel- ter, and sexual expression have been met. 2. The Physical Facilities Are Conducive to Achieve- ment of the Goals of Therapy. Space is provided so that each client has sufficient privacy, as well as physical space, for therapeutic interaction withothers. Furnishings are arranged to present ahomelike atmosphere\u2014usually in spaces that ac-commodate communal living, dining, and activityareas\u2014for facilitation of interpersonal interactionand communication. 3. A Democratic Form of Self-Government Exists. In the therapeutic community, clients participate in the decision-making and problem-solving that affect themanagement of the treatment setting. This is accom-plished through regularly scheduled communitymeetings. These meetings are attended by staff andclients, and all individuals have equal input into thediscussions. At these meetings, the norms and rulesand behavioral limits of the treatment setting are setforth. This reinforces the democratic posture of thetreatment setting, because these are expectationsthat affect all clients on an equal basis. An examplemight be the rule that no client may enter a roombeing occupied by a client of the opposite gender . Consequences of violating the rules are explained. Other issues that may be discussed at the community meetings include those with which certain clients havesome disagreements. A decision is then made by the en-tire group in a democratic manner. For example, sev-eral clients in an inpatient unit may disagree with thehours that have been designated for watching televisionon a weekend night. They may elect to bring up thisissue at a community meeting and suggest an extensionin television-viewing time. After discussion by the group,a vote will be taken, and clients and staff agree to abideby the expressed preference of the majority. Some ther-apeutic communities elect officers (usually a presidentand a secretary) who serve for a specified time. Thepresident calls the meeting to order, conducts the busi-ness of discussing old and new issues, and asks for vol-unteers (or makes appointments, alternately, so that allclients have a turn) to accomplish the daily tasks associ-ated with community living; for example, cleaning thetables after each meal and watering plants in the treat-ment facility. New assignments are made at each meet-ing. The secretary reads the minutes of the previousmeeting and takes minutes of the current meeting.Minutes are important in the event that clients have adisagreement about issues that were discussed at variousmeetings. Minutes provide written evidence of deci-sions made by the group. In treatment settings whereclients have short attention spans or disorganized think-ing, meetings are brief. Business is generally limited tointroductions and expectations of the here and now.Discussions also may include comments about a recentoccurrence in the group or something that has beenbothering a person and about which he or she has some questions. These meetings are usually conductedby staff, although all clients have equal input into thediscussions. All clients are expected to attend the meetings. Ex- ceptions are made when aspects of an individual's ther-apy interfere or take precedence. An explanation ismade to clients present so that false perceptions ofdanger are not generated by another person's absence.All staff members are expected to attend the meetings,unless client care precludes their attendance. 4. Responsibilities Are Assigned According to Client Capabilities. Increasing self-esteem is an ultimate goal of the therapeutic community. Therefore, a client should not be set up for failure by beingassigned a responsibility that is beyond his or her level of ability. By assigning clients responsibil-ities that promote achievement, self-esteem is en-hanced. Consideration must also be given to times210 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch12_208-216 24/07/14 5:25 PM Page 210during which the client will show some regression in the treatment regimen. Adjustments in assign-ments should be made in a way that preserves self-esteem and provides for progression to greaterdegrees of responsibility as the client returns toprevious level of functioning. 5. A Structured Program of Social and Work-Related Activities Is Scheduled as Part of the T reatment Pro- gram. Each client's therapeutic program consists of group activities in which interpersonal interactionand communication with other individuals are em-phasized. Time is also devoted to personal prob-lems. Various group activities may be selected for clients with specific needs (e.g., an exercise groupfor a person who expresses anger inappropriately , an assertiveness group for a person who is passive-aggressive, or a stress-management group for a per-son who is anxious). A structured schedule ofactivities is the major focus of a therapeutic commu-nity. Through these activities, change in the client'spersonality and behavior can be achieved. New cop-ing strategies are learned and social skills are devel-oped. In the group situation, the client is able topractice what he or she has learned to prepare fortransition to the general community. 6. Community and Family Are Included in the Pro- gram of Therapy in an Effor t to Facilitate Discharge from Treatment. An attempt is made to include family members, as well as certain aspects of thecommunity that affect the client, in the treatmentprogram. It is important to keep as many links tothe client's life outside of therapy as possible. Family members are invited to participate in specific ther - apy groups and, in some instances, to share mealswith the client in the communal dining room. Con-nection with community life may be maintainedthrough client group activities, such as shopping,picnicking, attending movies, bowling, and visitingthe zoo. Inpatient clients may be awarded passes tovisit family or may participate in work-related activ-ities, the length of time being determined by the ac-tivity and the client's condition. These connectionswith family and community facilitate the dischargeprocess and may help to prevent the client from becoming too dependent on the therapy. The Program of Therapeutic Community Care for clients in the therapeutic community is di-rected by an interdisciplinary treatment (IDT) team.An initial assessment is made by the admitting psychia-trist, nurse, or other designated admitting agent whoestablishes a priority of care. The IDT team determinesa comprehensive treatment plan and goals of therapyand assigns intervention responsibilities. All memberssign the treatment plan and meet regularly to updatethe plan as needed. Depending on the size of the treat-ment facility and scope of the therapy program, mem-bers representing a variety of disciplines may participatein the promotion of a therapeutic community. For example, an IDT team may include a psychiatrist, clin-ical psychologist, psychiatric clinical nurse specialist,psychiatric nurse, mental health technician, psychiatricsocial worker, occupational therapist, recreational ther-apist, art therapist, music therapist, psychodramatist, dietitian, and chaplain. Table 12-1 provides an explana-tion of responsibilities and educational preparation required for these members of the IDT team.CHAPTER 12 Milieu Therapy\u2014The Therapeutic Community 211 TABLE 12-1 The Interdisciplinary Treatment Team in Psychiatry TEAM MEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES CREDENTIALS Psychiatrist Clinical psychologistPsychiatric clinical nurse specialist Psychiatric nurseMedical deg ree with residency in psychiatry and license to practice medicine.

In the hospital, nurses aregenerally the only members of the IDT team whospend time with the clients on a 24-hour basis, andthey assume responsibility for management of thetherapeutic milieu. In all settings, the nursing processis used for the delivery of nursing care. Ongoing assessment, diagnosis, outcome identification, plan-ning, implementation, and evaluation of the environ-ment are necessary for the successful management ofa therapeutic milieu. Nurses are involved in all day-to-day activities that pertain to client care. Suggestionsand opinions of nursing staff are given serious con-sideration in the planning of care for individualclients. Information from the initial nursing assess-ment is used to create the IDT plan. Nurses haveinput into therapy goals and participate in the regularupdates and modification of treatment plans. In some treatment facilities, a separate nursing care plan is required in addition to the IDT plan. Whenthis is the case, the nursing care plan must reflect di-agnoses that are specific to nursing and include prob-lems and interventions from the IDT plan that havebeen assigned specifically to the discipline of nursing. In the therapeutic milieu, nurses are responsible for ensuring that clients' physiological needs are met.Clients must be encouraged to perform as independ-ently as possible in fulfilling activities of daily living.However, the nurse must make ongoing assessmentsto provide assistance for those who require it. Assess-ing physical status is an important nursing responsi-bility that must not be overlooked in a psychiatricsetting that emphasizes holistic care. Reality orientation for clients who have disorgan- ized thinking or who are disoriented or confused isimportant in the therapeutic milieu. Clocks with largehands and numbers, calendars that give the day anddate in large print, and orientation boards that dis-cuss daily activities and news happenings can helpkeep clients oriented to reality. Nurses should ensurethat clients have written schedules of activities towhich they are assigned and that they arrive at thoseactivities on schedule. Some clients may require anidentification sign on their door to remind themwhich room is theirs. On short-term units, nurses whoare dealing with psychotic clients usually rely on abasic activity or topic that helps keep people oriented:for example, showing pictures of the hospital wherethey are housed, introducing people who were admit-ted during the night, and providing name badgeswith their first name. Nurses are responsible for the management of medication administration on inpatient psychiatricunits. In some treatment programs, clients are ex-pected to accept the responsibility and request theirmedication at the appropriate time. Although ulti-mate responsibility lies with the nurse, he or she mustencourage clients to be self-reliant. Nurses must workwith the clients to determine methods that result in achievement and provide positive feedback for successes. A major focus of nursing in the therapeutic milieu is the one-to-one relationship that grows out of a de-veloping trust between client and nurse. Many clientswith psychiatric disorders have never achieved theability to trust. If this can be accomplished in a rela-tionship with the nurse, the trust may be generalizedto other relationships in the client's life. Within an at-mosphere of trust, the client is encouraged to expressfeelings and emotions and to discuss unresolved is-sues that are creating problems in his or her life. CLINICAL PEARL Developing trust means keeping promises that have been made. It means total acceptance of the individual as a person, separatefrom behavior that is unacceptable. It means responding to theclient with concrete behaviors that are understandable to him orher (e.g., \"If you are frightened, I will stay with you\"; \"If you arecold, I will bring you a blanket\"; \"If you are thirsty, I will bring you a drink of water\"). The nurse is responsible for setting limits on unac- ceptable behavior in the therapeutic milieu. This requires stating to the client in understandable ter-minology what behaviors are not acceptable and whatthe consequences will be should the limits be violated.These limits must be established, written, and carriedout by all staff. Consistency in carrying out the conse-quences of violation of the established limits is essen-tial if the learning is to be reinforced. The role of client teacher is important in the psychi- atric area, as it is in all areas of nursing. Nurses must beable to assess learning readiness in individual clients. Dothey want to learn? What is their level of anxiety? Whatis their level of ability to understand the informationbeing presented? Topics for client education in psychi-atry include information about medical diagnoses, sideeffects of medications, the importance of continuing totake medications, and stress management, among oth-ers. Some topics must be individualized for specificclients, whereas others may be taught in group situa-tions. Table 12-2 outlines various topics of nursing con-cern for client education in psychiatry. (Sample clientteaching guides may be found at www.DavisPlus.com.) Echternacht (2001) stated: Milieu therapy interventions are recognized as one of the basic-level functions of psychiatric-mental healthnurses as addressed [in the Psychiatric-Mental CHAPTER 12 Therapy\u2014The Therapeutic Community 2134092_Ch12_208-216 24/07/14 5:25 PM Page 213Summary and Key Points In psychiatry, milieu therapy (or a therapeutic com- munity) constitutes a manipulation of the environ-ment in an effort to create behavioral changes andto improve the psychological health and function-ing of the individual. The goal of therapeutic community is for the clientto learn adaptive coping, interaction, and relation-ship skills that can be generalized to other aspectsof his or her life. The community environment itself serves as theprimary tool of therapy. According to Skinner (1979), a therapeutic com-munity is based on seven basic assumptions: The health in each individual is to be realizedand encouraged to grow. Every interaction is an opportunity for therapeuticintervention. The client owns his or her own environment. Each client owns his or her behavior. Peer pressure is a useful and a powerful tool. Inappropriate behaviors are dealt with as theyoccur. Restrictions and punishment are to be avoided. Because the goals of milieu therapy relate to help-ing the client learn to generalize that which islearned to other aspects of his or her life, the con-ditions that promote a therapeutic community inthe psychiatric setting are similar to the types ofconditions that exist in real-life situations. Conditions that promote a therapeutic communityinclude the following: The fulfillment of basic physiological needs. Physical facilities that are conducive to achieve-ment of the goals of therapy. The existence of a democratic form of self-government. The assignment of responsibilities according toclient capabilities. A structured program of social and work-relatedactivities. The inclusion of community and family in the program of therapy in an effort to facilitatedischarge from treatment. The program of therapy on the milieu unit is conducted by the IDT team. The team includes some, or all, of the following disciplines and may include others that are not specified here: psychiatrist, clinical psychologist,psychiatric clinical nurse specialist, psychiatricnurse, mental health technician, psychiatric socialworker, occupational therapist, recreational thera-pist, art therapist, music therapist, psychodramatist,dietitian, and chaplain.214 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care TABLE 12-2 The Therapeutic Milieu\u2014Topics for Client Education 1.Ways to increase self-esteem 2.Ways to deal with anger appropriately 3.Stress-management techniques 4.How to recognize signs of increasing anxiety and in- tervene to stop progression 5.Normal stages of g rieving and behaviors associated with each stage 6.Assertiveness techniques 7.Relaxation techniques a.Progressive relaxation b.Tense and relax d.Mental 8.Medications (specify) a.Reason for taking b.Harmless side effects c.Side effects to report to physician d.Importance of taking regularly e.Importance of not stopping abruptly 9.Effects of (substance) reproductive system b.Contraceptives c.Sexually transmitted diseases 13.The essentials of good nutrition 14.(For parents/guardians)a.Signs and symptoms of substance abuse b.Effective parenting techniques Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice , (ANA, 2007)].

(p. 39) Now is the time to rekindle interest in the thera- peutic milieu concept and to reclaim nursing's tradi-tional milieu intervention functions. Nurses need toidentify the number of registered nurses necessary tocarry out structured and unstructured milieu functionsconsistent with their Standards of Practice. (p. 43)4092_Ch12_208-216 24/07/14 5:25 PM Page 214Nurses play a crucial role in the management of a therapeutic milieu. They are involved in the assess-ment, diagnosis, outcome identification, planning,implementation, and evaluation of all treatmentprograms. Nurses have significant input into the IDT plans,which are developed for all clients. They are re-sponsible for ensuring that clients' basic needs arefulfilled; assessing physical and psychosocial status;administering medication; helping the client develop trusting relationships; setting limits on unacceptable behaviors; educating clients; and ultimately, helping clients, within the limits oftheir capability, to become productive members ofsociety.

HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT Please read the chapter and answer the following questions: 1.Name the three factors that determine whether or not a person experiences a crisis in response to a stressful situation. 2.What is the goal of crisis intervention? 3.Individuals in crisis need to develop more adaptive coping strateg ies. How does the nurse provide assistance with thisprocess? 4.Describe behaviors common to preschoolchildren following a traumatic event.CORE CONCEPT crisis Stressful situations are a part of everyday life. Any stressful situation can precipitate a crisis. Crises resultin a disequilibrium from which many individuals require assistance to recover . Crisis intervention re- quires problem-solving skills that are often diminishedby the level of anxiety accompanying disequilibrium.Assistance with problem solving during the crisis period preserves self-esteem and promotes growthwith resolution.In recent years, individuals in the United States have been faced with a number of catastrophic events,including natural disasters such as tornados, earth-quakes, hurricanes, and floods. Also, man-made disas-ters, such as the Oklahoma City and Boston Marathonbombings and the attacks on the World Trade Centerand the Pentagon, have created psychological stress of astronomical proportions in populations aroundthe world. 2174092_Ch13_217-234 24/07/14 5:25 PM Page 217This chapter examines the phases in the develop- ment of a crisis and the types of crises that occur in people's lives. The methodology of crisis intervention,including the role of the nurse, is explored. A discus-sion of disaster nursing is also presented. Characteristics of a Crisis A number of characteristics have been identified thatcan be viewed as assumptions upon which the con-cept of crisis is based (Aguilera, 1998; Caplan, 1964;Winston, 2008). They include the following: 1.Crisis occurs in all individuals at one time or anotherand is not necessarily equated with psychopathology. 2. Crises are precipitated by specific identifiableevents. 3. Crises are personal by nature. What may be con-sidered a crisis situation by one individual may notbe so for another. 4. Crises are acute, not chronic, and will be resolvedin one way or another within a brief period. 5. A crisis situation contains the potential for psycho-logical growth or deterioration. Individuals who are in crisis feel helpless to change. They do not believe they have the resourcesto deal with the precipitating stressor. Levels of anxiety rise to the point that the individual becomesnonfunctional, thoughts become obsessional, andall behavior is aimed at relief of the anxiety beingexperienced. The feeling is overwhelming and may affect the individual physically as well as psychologically. Bateman and Peternelj-Taylor (1998) stated: Outside Western culture, a crisis is often viewed as a time for movement and growth. The Chinese symbolfor crisis [Figure 13-1] consists of the characters fordanger and opportunity . When a crisis is viewed as an opportunity for growth, those involved are muchmore capable of resolving related issues and moreable to move toward positive changes. When the crisisexperience is overwhelming because of its scope andnature or when there has not been adequate prepa-ration for the necessary changes, the dangers seemparamount and overshadow any potential growth.The results are maladaptive coping and dysfunctionalbehavior. (pp. 144-145)Phases in the Development of a Crisis The development of a crisis situation follows a rela- tively predictable course. Caplan (1964) outlined four specific phases through which individualsprogress in response to a precipitating stressor andthat culminate in the state of acute crisis. 1. Phase 1. The individual is exposed to a precipitating stressor . Anxiety increases; previous problem-solving techniques are employed. 2. Phase 2. When previous problem-solving techniques do not relieve the str essor, anxiety increases further. The individual begins to feel a great deal of dis- comfort at this point. Coping techniques thathave worked in the past are attempted, only tocreate feelings of helplessness when they are not successful. Feelings of confusion and disor-ganization prevail. 3. Phase 3. All possible resources, both internal and exter- nal, are called on to r esolve the problem and relieve the discomfort. The individual may try to view the prob-lem from a different perspective, or even to over-look certain aspects of it. New problem-solvingtechniques may be used, and, if effectual, resolu-tion may occur at this phase, with the individual returning to a higher, a lower, or the previous levelof premorbid functioning. 4. Phase 4. If resolution does not occur in previous phases, Caplan states that \"the tension mounts beyond a further thr eshold or its burden increases over time to a breaking point. Major disorganization of the individual with drastic results often occurs\" (p. 41). Anxiety may reach panic levels. Cognitive functions are disordered,emotions are labile, and behavior may reflect thepresence of psychotic thinking. These phases are congruent with the Transactional Model of Stress/Adaptation outlined in Chapter 1. The relationship between the two perspectives is pre-sented in Figure 13-2. Similarly, Aguilera (1998)spoke of \"balancing factors\" that affect the way inwhich an individual perceives and responds to a precipitating stressor. A schematic of these balancingfactors is illustrated in Figure 13-3.218 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care CORE CONCEPT Crisis A sudden event in one's life that disturbs homeostasis, during which usual coping mechanisms cannot resolvethe problem (Lagerquist, 2006, p. 393) FIGURE 13-1 Chinese symbol for crisis.4092_Ch13_217-234 24/07/14 5:25 PM Page 218The paradigm set forth by Aguilera suggests that whether or not an individual experiences a crisis in response to a stressful situation depends upon the following three factors: 1. The individual's perception of the event. If the event is perceived realistically, the individual is more likely to draw upon adequate resources to re-store equilibrium. If the perception of the event isdistorted, attempts at problem solving are likely tobe ineffective, and restoration of equilibrium goesunresolved. 2 . The availability of situational supports. Aguilera stated, \"Situational supports are those persons who are available in the environment and who can be depended on to help solve the problem\"(p. 37). Without adequate situational supportsduring a stressful situation, an individual is mostlikely to feel overwhelmed and alone. 3. The availability of adequate coping mechanisms. When a stressful situation occurs, individuals draw upon behavioral strategies that have beensuccessful for them in the past. If these copingstrategies work, a crisis may be diverted. If not, disequilibrium may continue and tension and anxiety increase. As previously set forth, it is assumed that crises are acute, not chronic, situations that will be re-solved in one way or another within a brief period.Winston (2008) stated, \"Crises tend to be time limited, generally lasting no more than a fewmonths; the duration depends on the stressor and on the individual's perception of and responseto the stressor\" (p. 1270). Crises can become growthopportunities when individuals learn new methodsof coping that can be preserved and used when similar stressors recur. Types of Crises Baldwin (1978) identified six classes of emotionalcrises, which progress by degree of severity. As themeasure of psychopathology increases, the source ofCHAPTER 13 Crisis Intervention 219 FIGURE 13-2 Relationship between Transac- tional Model of Stress/Adaptation and Caplan's phases in the development of a crisis.Precipitating event Predisposing Factors: Genetic Influences: Family history Past Existing Conditions: mechanisms Primary** Stress appraisals Harm/ lossThreat Challenge Secondary** Availability of coping strategies Perceived effectiveness of coping strategies Perceived ability to use coping strategies effectively Quality of response Adaptive (no crisis)Maladaptive (crisis) PHASE 219the stressor changes from external to internal. The type of crisis determines the method of interventionselected. Class 1: Dispositional Crises Definition An acute response to an external situa-tional stressor. EXAM PLE Nancy and Ted have been married for 3 years and have a 1-year-old daughter. Ted has been having difficulty with his boss at work. Twice during the past 6 months he hasexploded in anger at home and become abusive withNancy. Last night he became angry that dinner was notready when he expected. He grabbed the baby fromNancy and tossed her, screaming, into her crib. He hit andpunched Nancy until she feared for her life. This morningwhen he left for work, she took the baby and went to theemergency department of the city hospital, not having anywhere else to go. Intervention Nancy's physical wounds were cared for in the emergency department. The mental health counselor provided support and guidance in termsof presenting alternatives to her. Needs and issueswere clarified, and referrals for agency assistancewere made. Class 2: Crises of Anticipated Life Transitions Definition Normal life-cycle transitions that may be anticipated but over which the individual may feel a lack of control. EXAMPLE College student J.T. is placed on probationary status because of low grades this semester. His wife had a baby and had toquit her job. He increased his working hours from part timeto full time to compensate, and therefore had little time forstudies. He presents himself to the student-health nurse prac-titioner complaining of numerous vague physical complaints. Intervention Physical examination should be per- formed (physical symptoms could be caused by de- pression) and ventilation of feelings encouraged.Reassurance and support should be provided asneeded. J.T. should be referred to ser vices that can provide financial and other types of needed assis-tance. Problematic areas should be identified and approaches to change discussed.220 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Precipitating event State of disequilibrium Balancing factors Individual's perception of the event Support systems Coping mechanismsRealistic Adequate EffectiveUnrealistic Inadequate Ineffective Problem is resolved NO CRISISProblem unresolved CRISISFIGURE 13-3 The effects of balancing factors in a stressful event.4092_Ch13_217-234 24/07/14 5:25 PM Page 220Class 3: Crises Resulting From Traumatic Stress Definition Crisis precipitated by an unexpected exter- nal stressor over which the individual has little or no control and as a result of which he or she feelsemotionally over whelmed and defeated. EXAMPLE Sally is a waitperson whose shift ended at midnight. Two weeks ago, while walking to her car in the deserted parkinglot, she was abducted by two men with guns, taken to anabandoned building, and raped and beaten. Since that time,her physical wounds have nearly healed. However, Sally can-not be alone, is constantly fearful, relives the experience inflashbacks and dreams, and is unable to eat, sleep, or workat her job in the restaurant. Her friend offers to accompanyher to the mental health clinic. Intervention The nurse should encourage Sally to talk about the experience and to express her feelings as- sociated with it. The nurse should offer reassuranceand support; discuss stages of grief and how rapecauses a loss of self-worth, triggering the grief re-sponse; identify support systems that can help Sally toresume her normal activities; and explore new meth-ods of coping with emotions arising from a situationwith which she has had no previous experience. Class 4: Maturational/Developmental Crises Definition Crises that occur in response to situationsthat trigger emotions related to unresolved conflictsin one's life. These crises are of internal origin and reflect underlying developmental issues that involvedependency , value conflicts, sexual identity, control, and capacity for emotional intimacy. EXAMPLE Bob is 40 years old. He has just been passed over for a job promotion for the third time. He has moved many times withinthe large company for which he works, usually after angeringand alienating himself from the supervisor. His father was dom-ineering and became abusive when Bob did not comply withhis every command. Over the years, Bob's behavioral responsebecame one of passive-aggressiveness\u2014first with his father,then with his supervisors. This third rejection has created feel-ings of depression and intense anxiety in Bob. At his wife's insistence, he has sought help at the mental health clinic. Intervention The primary intervention is to help Bob identify the unresolved developmental issue that is creating the conflict. Support and guidance are of-fered during the initial crisis period, then assistanceis given to help Bob work through the underlyingconflict in an effort to change response patterns thatare creating problems in his current life situation.Class 5: Crises Reflecting Psychopathology Definition Emotional crises in which preexisting psy-chopathology has been instrumental in precipitatingthe crisis or in which psychopathology significantlyimpairs or complicates adaptive resolution. Examplesof psychopathology that may precipitate crises in-clude personality disorders, anxiety disorders, bipolardisorder, and schizophrenia. EXAM PLE Sonja, age 29, was diagnosed with borderline personality dis- order at age 18. She has been in therapy on a weekly basisfor 10 years, with several hospitalizations for suicide attemptsduring that time. She has had the same therapist for the past6 years. This therapist told Sonja today that she is to be mar-ried in 1 month and will be moving across the country withher new husband. Sonja is distraught and experiencing in-tense feelings of abandonment. She is found wandering inand out of traffic on a busy expressway, oblivious to her surroundings. Police bring her to the emergency departmentof the hospital. Intervention The initial intervention is to help bring down the level of anxiety in Sonja that has created feelings of unreality in her. She requires that someone stay with her and reassure her of her safety and secu-rity . After the feelings of panic anxiety have subsided, she should be encouraged to verbalize her feelings ofabandonment. Regressive behaviors should be dis-couraged. Positive reinforcement should be given forindependent activities and accomplishments. The pri-mary therapist will need to pursue this issue of termi-nation with Sonja at length. Referral to a long-termcare facility may be required. Class 6: Psychiatric Emergencies Definition Crisis situations in which general function-ing has been severely impaired and the individualrendered incompetent or unable to assume personalresponsibility. Examples include acutely suicidal indi- viduals, drug overdoses, reactions to hallucinogenicdrugs, acute psychoses, uncontrollable anger, and alcohol intoxication. EXAMPLE Jennifer, age 16, had been dating Joe, the star high school football player, for 6 months. After the game on Friday night,Jennifer and Joe went to Jackie's house, where a number ofhigh school students had gathered for an after-game party.No adults were present. About midnight, Joe told Jenniferthat he did not want to date her anymore. Jennifer becamehysterical, and Jackie was frightened by her behavior. Shetook Jennifer to her parent's bedroom and gave her a Val-ium from a bottle in her mother's medicine cabinet. She left Jennifer lying on her parent's bed and returned to the partyCHAPTER 13 Crisis Intervention 2214092_Ch13_217-234 24/07/14 5:25 PM Page 221downstairs. About an hour later, she returned to her parent's bedroom and found that Jennifer had removed the bottle of Valium from the cabinet and swallowed all of the tablets.Jennifer was unconscious and Jackie could not awaken her.An ambulance was called and Jennifer was transported tothe local hospital. Intervention The crisis team monitored vital signs, ensured maintenance of adequate airway , initiated gastric lavage, and administered activated charcoalto minimize absorption. Jennifer's parents were notified and rushed to the hospital. The situationwas explained to them, and they were encouragedto stay by her side. When the physical crisis was resolved, Jennifer was transferred to the psychiatricunit. In therapy, she was encouraged to ventilate her feelings regarding the rejection and subsequentoverdose. Family therapy sessions were conductedin an effort to clarify interpersonal issues and to identify areas for change. On an individual level,Jennifer's therapist worked with her to establishmore adaptive methods of coping with stressful situations. Crisis Intervention Individuals experiencing crises have an urgent needfor assistance. In crisis intervention the therapist, or other intervener, becomes a part of the individual'slife situation. Because of the individual's emotionalstate, he or she is unable to problem-solve, so requiresguidance and support from another to help mobilizethe resources needed to resolve the crisis. Lengthy psychological interpretations are not ap- propriate for crisis intervention. It is a time fordoing what is needed to help the individual get re-lief and for calling into action all the people andother resources required to do so. Aguilera (1998)stated: The goal of crisis intervention is the resolution of an immediate crisis. Its focus is on the supportive,with the restoration of the individual to his precrisislevel of functioning or possibly to a higher level offunctioning. The therapist's role is direct, supportive,and that of an active participant. (p. 24) Crisis intervention takes place in both inpatient and outpatient settings. The basic methodology re- lies heavily on orderly problem-solving techniquesand structured activities that are focused on change.Through adaptive change, crises are resolved andgrowth occurs. Because of the time limitation of crisis intervention, the individual must experiencesome degree of relief almost from the first interac-tion. Crisis intervention, then, is not aimed at majorpersonality change or reconstruction (as may be the case in long-term psychotherapy), but rather at using a given crisis situation, at the very least, torestore functioning and, at most, to enhance per-sonal growth. Phases of Crisis Intervention: The Role of the Nurse Nurses respond to crisis situations on a daily basis.Crises can occur on every unit in the general hospital,in the home setting, in the community health caresetting, in schools and offices, and in private practice.Indeed, nurses may be called on to function as crisishelpers in virtually any setting committed to the prac-tice of nursing. Roberts and Ottens (2005) provided a seven-stage model of crisis intervention. This model is summa-rized in Table 13-1. Aguilera (1998) described fourspecific phases in the technique of crisis interventionthat are clearly comparable to the steps of the nursingprocess. These phases are discussed in the followingparagraphs. Phase 1. Assessment In this phase, the crisis helper gathers information regarding the precipitating stressor and the resulting222 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care TABLE 13-1 Roberts' Seven-Stage Crisis Intervention Model STAGE INTERVENTIONS Stage I. Psychosocial and Lethality Assessment Stage II . Rapidly Establish RapportConduct a rapid but thorough biopsychosocial assessment. The counselor uses genuineness, respect, and unconditional acceptance to establish rapport with the client. Skills such as good eye contact, a nonjudgmental attitude, flexibility,and maintaining a positive mental attitude are important.4092_Ch13_217-234 24/07/14 5:25 PM Page 222crisis that prompted the individual to seek profes- sional help. A nurse in crisis intervention might per-form some of the following assessments: Ask the individual to describe the event that pre-cipitated this crisis. Determine when it occurred. Assess the individual's physical and mental status. Determine if the individual has experienced this stressor before. If so, what method of copingwas used? Have these methods been tried thistime? If previous coping methods were tried, what wasthe result? If new coping methods were tried, what was theresult? Assess suicide or homicide potential, plan, andmeans. Assess the adequacy of support systems.Determine level of precrisis functioning. Assess theusual coping methods, available support systems,and ability to problem-solve. Assess the individual's perception of personalstrengths and limitations. Assess the individual's use of substances. Information from the comprehensive assessment is then analyzed, and appropriate nursing diagnosesreflecting the immediacy of the crisis situation areidentified. Some nursing diagnoses that may be rele-vant include: Ineffective coping Anxiety (severe to panic) Disturbed thought processes (has been removedfrom the NANDA-I list of approved diagnoses, butis used for purposes of this textbook) Risk for self- or other-directed violence Rape-trauma syndromeCHAPTER 13 Crisis Intervention 223 TABLE 13-1 Roberts' Seven-Stage Crisis Intervention Model\u2014cont'd STAGE INTERVENTIONS Stage III.

Follow-Up Adapted from Roberts, A.R., & Ottens, A.J. (2005). The seven-stage crisis intervention model: A road map to goal attainment, pr oblem solving, and crisis resolution. Brief Treatment and Crisis Intervention, 5 (4), 329-339.Identify the precipitating event that has led the client to seek help at the present time. Identify other situations that led up to the precipitating event. Prioritize major problems with which the client needs help. Discuss client's current style of coping, and offer assistance in areaswhere modification would be helpful in resolving the present crisisand preventing future crises. Encourage the client to vent feelings. Provide validation. Use therapeutic communication techniques to help the client explain his or her story about the current crisis situation. Eventually, and cautiously, begin to challenge maladaptive beliefsand behaviors, and help the client adopt more rational and adaptive options. Collaboratively explore options with the client. Identify coping strategies that have been successful for the client inthe past. Help the client problem-solve strategies for confronting current crisis adaptively. There is a shift at this stage from crisis to resolution. Develop a concrete plan of action to deal directly with the current crisis. Having a concrete plan restores the client's equilibrium and psy-chological balance. Work through the meaning of the event that precipitated the crisis.How could it have been prevented? What responses may have aggravated the situation? Plan a follow-up visit with the client to evaluate the post-crisis status of the client. Beneficial scheduling of follow-up visits include 1-month and 1-yearanniversaries of the crisis event.4092_Ch13_217-234 24/07/14 5:25 PM Page 223Post-trauma syndrome Fear Phase 2. Planning of Therapeutic Intervention In the planning phase of crisis intervention, the nurse selects the appropriate nursing actions for the identi-fied nursing diagnoses. In planning the interventions,the type of crisis, as well as the individual's strengthsand available resources for support, are taken intoconsideration. Goals are established for crisis resolu-tion and a return to, or increase in, the precrisis levelof functioning. Phase 3. Intervention During phase 3, the actions that were identified inphase 2 are implemented. The following interven-tions are the focus of nursing in crisis intervention: Use a reality-oriented approach. The focus of theproblem is on the here and now. Remain with the individual who is experiencingpanic anxiety. Establish a rapid working relationship by showingunconditional acceptance, by active listening, andby attending to immediate needs. Discourage lengthy explanations or rationaliza-tions of the situation; promote an atmosphere forverbalization of true feelings. Set firm limits on aggressive, destructive behav-iors. At high levels of anxiety, behavior is likely tobe impulsive and regressive. Establish at the outsetwhat is acceptable and what is not, and maintainconsistency. Clarify the problem that the individual is facing.The nurse does this by describing his or her per-ception of the problem and comparing it with theindividual's perception of the problem. Help the individual determine what he or she be-lieves precipitated the crisis. Acknowledge feelings of anger, guilt, helplessness,and powerlessness, while taking care not to providepositive feedback for these feelings. Guide the individual through a problem-solvingprocess by which he or she may move in the direc-tion of positive life change: Help the individual confront the source of theproblem that is creating the crisis response. Encourage the individual to discuss changes heor she would like to make. Jointly determinewhether or not desired changes are realistic. Encourage exploration of feelings about as-pects that cannot be changed, and explore alternative ways of coping more adaptively inthese situations.Discuss alternative strategies for creating changesthat are realistically possible. Weigh benefits and consequences of each alternative. Assist the individual to select alternative copingstrategies that will help alleviate future crisis situations. CLINICAL PEARL Coping mechanisms are highly individual and the choice ultimately must be made by the client. The nurse mayoffer suggestions and provide guidance to help the client identifycoping mechanisms that are realistic for him or her, and that can promote positive outcomes in a crisis situation. Identify external support systems and new social networks from which the individual may seek assis-tance in times of stress. Phase 4. Evaluation of Crisis Resolution and Anticipatory Planning To evaluate the outcome of crisis intervention, a reassessment is made to determine if the stated objective was achieved: Have positive behavioral changes occurred? Has the individual developed more adaptive cop-ing strategies? Have they been effective? Has the individual grown from the experience bygaining insight into his or her responses to crisissituations? Does the individual believe that he or she could re-spond with healthy adaptation in future stressfulsituations to prevent crisis development? Can the individual describe a plan of action fordealing with stressors similar to the one that pre-cipitated this crisis? During the evaluation period, the nurse and client summarize what has occurred during the interven-tion. They review what the individual has learned and\"anticipate\" how he or she will respond in the future.A determination is made regarding follow-up therapy;if needed, the nurse provides referral information. Disaster Nursing Although there are many definitions of disaster , a common feature is that the event overwhelms localresources and threatens the function and safety of thecommunity (Norwood, Ursano, & Fullerton, 2000). Aviolent disaster, whether natural or man-made, mayleave devastation of property or life. Such tragediesalso leave victims with a damaged sense of safety andwell-being, and varying degrees of emotional trauma.Children, who lack life experiences and coping skills,are particularly vulnerable. Their sense of order and224 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch13_217-234 24/07/14 5:25 PM Page 224security has been seriously disrupted, and they are un- able to understand that the disruption is time-limitedand that their world will eventually return to normal. Application of the Nursing Process to Disaster Nursing Background Assessment Data Individuals respond to traumatic events in many ways. Grieving is a natural response following any loss,and it may be more extreme if the disaster is directlyexperienced or witnessed. The emotional effects ofloss and disruption may show up immediately or mayappear weeks or months later. Psychological and behavioral responses common in adults following trauma and disaster include anger;disbelief; sadness; anxiety; fear; irritability; arousal;numbing; sleep disturbance; and increases in alcohol,caffeine, and tobacco use (Norwood et al., 2000). Pre-school children commonly experience separationanxiety, regressive behaviors, nightmares, and hyper-active or withdrawn behaviors. Older children mayhave difficulty concentrating, somatic complaints,sleep disturbances, and concerns about safety. Ado-lescents' responses are often similar to those of adults. Norwood and associates (2000) stated: Traumatic bereavement is recognized as posing spe- cial challenges to survivors. While the death of lovedones is always painful, an unexpected and violentdeath can be more difficult to assimilate. Familymembers may develop intrusive images of the deathbased on information gleaned from authorities or themedia. Witnessing or learning of violence to a lovedone also increases vulnerability to psychiatric disor-ders. The knowledge that one has been exposed totoxins is a potent traumatic stressor . . . and the focusof much concern in the medical community prepar-ing for responses to terrorist attacks using biological,chemical, or nuclear agents. (p. 214) Nursing Diagnoses/Outcome Identification Information from the assessment is analyzed, and appropriate nursing diagnoses reflecting the imme-diacy of the situation are identified. Some nursing diagnoses that may be relevant include: Risk for injury (trauma, suffocation, poisoning) Risk for infection Anxiety (panic) Fear Spiritual distress Risk for post-trauma syndrome Ineffective community coping The following criteria may be used for measure- ment of outcomes in the care of the client having experienced a traumatic event. Timelines are individ-ually determined. The client: Experiences minimal/no injury to self. Demonstrates behaviors necessary to protect selffrom further injury. Identifies interventions to prevent/reduce risk ofinfection. Is free of infection. Maintains anxiety at manageable level. Expresses beliefs and values about spiritual issues. Demonstrates ability to deal with emotional reac-tions in an individually appropriate manner. Demonstrates an increase in activities to improvecommunity functioning. Planning/Implementation Table 13-2 provides a plan of care for the client whohas experienced a traumatic event. Selected nursingdiagnoses are presented, along with outcome criteria,appropriate nursing interventions, and rationales foreach. Evaluation In the final step of the nursing process, a reassess-ment is conducted to determine if the nursing actionshave been successful in achieving the objectives ofcare. Evaluation of the nursing actions for the clientwho has experienced a traumatic event may be facili-tated by gathering information utilizing the followingtypes of questions: Has the client escaped serious injury, or have in-juries been resolved? Have infections been prevented or resolved? Is the client able to maintain anxiety at manageablelevel? Does he or she demonstrate appropriate problem-solving skills? Is the client able to discuss his or her beliefs aboutspiritual issues? Does the client demonstrate the ability to deal withemotional reactions in an individually appropriatemanner? Does he or she verbalize a subsiding of the physicalmanifestations (e.g., pain, nightmares, flashbacks,fatigue) associated with the traumatic event? Has there been recognition of factors affecting the community's ability to meet its own demandsor needs? Has there been a demonstration of increased activities to improve community functioning? Has a plan been established and put in place todeal with future contingencies?CHAPTER 13 Crisis Intervention 225 (Text continued on page 232)4092_Ch13_217-234 24/07/14 5:25 PM Page 225226 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Table 13-2 | CARE PLAN FOR THE CLIENT WHO HAS EXPERIENCED A TRAUMATIC EVENT NURSING DIAGNOSIS: ANXIETY (PANIC)/FEAR RELATED TO: Real or perceived threat to physical well-being; threat of death; situational crisis; exposure to toxins; unmet needs E VIDENCED BY: Persistent feelings of apprehension and uneasiness; sense of impending doom; impaired functioning; verbal expressions of having no control or influence over situation, outcome, or self-care; sympathetic stimulation; extraneous physical movements OUTCOME CRITERIA NURSING INTERVENTIONS RATIONALE Client will maintain anxiety at manageable level.1.Determine degree of anxiety/fear present, associated behaviors(e.g., laughter , crying, calm or ag itation, excited/hysterical behav- ior, expressions of disbelief and/or self-blame), and reality of perceived threat. 2.Note degree of disorganization. 3.Create as quiet an area as possible.Maintain a calm, confident manner .

All individuals experience crises at one time or another. This does not necessarily indicate psychopathology. Crises are precipitated by specific identifiableevents and are determined by an individual's per-sonal perception of the situation. Crises are acute rather than chronic and generallylast no more than a few weeks to a few months. Crises occur when an individual is exposed to astressor and previous problem-solving techniquesare ineffective. This causes the level of anxiety torise. Panic may ensue when new techniques aretried and resolution fails to occur. Six types of crises have been identified. They in-clude dispositional crises, crises of anticipated lifetransitions, crises resulting from traumatic stress,maturation/developmental crises, crises reflectingpsychopathology, and psychiatric emergencies.The type of crisis determines the method of inter-vention selected. Crisis intervention is designed to provide rapid assistance for individuals who have an urgent need.The minimum therapeutic goal of crisis interven-tion is psychological resolution of the individual'simmediate crisis and restoration to at least the levelof functioning that existed before the crisis period.A maximum goal is improvement in functioningabove the precrisis level. Nurses regularly respond to individuals in crisis inall types of settings. Nursing process is the vehicleby which nurses assist individuals in crisis with ashort-term problem-solving approach to change. A four-phase technique of crisis intervention in-cludes assessment/analysis, planning of therapeu-tic intervention, intervention, and evaluation ofcrisis resolution and anticipatory planning. Through this structured method of assistance,nurses help individuals in crisis to develop moreadaptive coping strategies for dealing with stressfulsituations in the future. Nurses have many important skills that can assist in-dividuals and communities in the wake of traumaticevents. Nursing interventions presented in this chap-ter were developed for the nursing diagnoses of panicanxiety/fear, spiritual distress, risk for post-traumasyndrome, and ineffective community coping.232 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Additional info available at www.davisplus.com Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT Please read the chapter and answer the following questions: 1.What is the goal of assertive behavior? 2.Assertive individuals accept negative aspects about themselves, and admit when they have made a mistake. W hat is this technique called? 3.W hat technique may be used to rid the mind of negative thoughts with which an individual may be obsessed? Give an example. 4.Why are \"I\" statements an effective commu-nication technique?CORE CONCEPT assertive behavior Alberti and Emmons (2008) have proposed the follow- ing questions: Are you able to express warm, positive feelings to an- other person? Are you comfortable starting a conver-sation with strangers at a party? Do you sometimesfeel ineffective in making your desires clear to others?Do you have difficulty saying no to persuasive people?Are you often at the bottom of the \"pecking order,\"pushed around by others? Or maybe you're the onewho pushes others around to get your way? (p. 5) Assertive behavior promotes a feeling of personal power and self-confidence. These two components are commonly lacking in clients with emotional dis-orders. Becoming more assertive empowers individu-als by promoting self-esteem, without diminishing theesteem of others. 235144092_Ch14_235-246 24/07/14 5:26 PM Page 235This chapter describes a number of rights that are considered basic to human beings. Various kinds of be- haviors are explored, including assertive, nonassertive,aggressive, and passive-aggressive. Techniques that promote assertive behavior and the nurse's role in assertiveness training are presented.5.The right to be listened to and taken seriously. 6.The right to change your mind. 7.The right to ask for what you want. 8.The right to put yourself first, sometimes. 9.The right to set your own priorities. 10.The right to refuse justification for your feelingsor behavior. In accepting these rights, an individual also accepts the responsibilities that accompany them. Rights andresponsibilities are reciprocal entities. T o experience one without the other is inherently destructive to anindividual. Some responsibilities associated with basicassertive human rights are presented in Table 14-1. Response Patterns Individuals develop patterns of responding to others.Some of these patterns that have been identified include: 1.Watching other people (role modeling). 2.Being positively reinforced or punished for a certain response. 3.Inventing a response. 4.Not being able to think of a better way to respond. 5.Not developing the proper skills for a better response. 6.Consciously choosing a response style. The nurse should be able to recognize his or her own pattern of responding, as well as that of others. Four response patterns will be discussedhere: nonassertive, assertive, aggressive, and passive-aggressive. Nonassertive Behavior Individuals who are nonassertive (sometimes called passive) seek to please others at the expense of deny-ing their own basic human rights. They seldom lettheir true feelings show and often feel hurt and anx-ious because they allow others to choose for them.They seldom achieve their own desired goals. Theycome across as being very apologetic and tend to beself-deprecating. They use actions instead of wordsand hope someone will \"guess\" what they want. Theirvoices are hesitant, weak, and expressed in a mono-tone. Their eyes are usually downcast. They feel un-comfortable in interpersonal interactions. All theywant is to please and to be liked by others. Their be-havior helps them avoid unpleasant situations andconfrontations with others; however, they often har-bor anger and resentment. Assertive Behavior Assertive individuals stand up for their own rights while protecting the rights of others. Feelings are expressedopenly and honestly. They assume responsibility for236 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Assertive Communication Assertive behavior helps us feel good about ourselvesand increases our self-esteem. It helps us feel goodabout other people and increases our ability to developsatisfying relationships with others. This is accom-plished out of honesty, directness, appropriateness,and respecting one's own basic rights as well as therights of others. Honesty is basic to assertive behavior. Assertive honesty is not an outspoken declaration of everythingthat is on one's mind. It is instead an accurate repre-sentation of feelings, opinions, or preferences ex-pressed in a manner that promotes self-respect andrespect for others. Direct communication is stating what one wants to convey with clarity and candor. Hinting and \"beatingaround the bush\" are indirect forms of communication. Communication must occur in an appropriate con- text to be considered assertive. The location and tim-ing, as well as the manner (tone of voice, nonverbalgestures) in which the communication is presented,must be correct for the situation. Basic Human Rights A number of authors have identified a variety of \"as-sertive rights\" 2013; 2000; Sobel &Ornstein, 1996). Following is a composite of 10 basicassertive human rights adapted from the aggregationof sources. 1.The right to be treated with respect. 2.The right to express feelings, opinions, and beliefs. 3.The right to say \"no\" without feeling guilty. 4.The right to make mistakes and accept the respon-sibility for them.CORE CONCEPT Assertive Behavior Assertive behavior promotes equality in human rela- tionships, enabling us to act in our own best interests,to stand up for ourselves without undue anxiety, to express honest feelings comfortably, to exercise per-sonal rights without denying the rights of others (Alberti& Emmons, 2008, p. 8). 4092_Ch14_235-246 24/07/14 5:26 PM Page 236their own choices and allow others to choose for them- selves. They maintain self-respect and respect for othersby treating everyone equally and with human dignity.They communicate tactfully, using lots of \"I\" statements.Their voices are warm and expressive, and eye contactis intermittent but direct. These individuals desire to communicate effectively with, and be respected by,others. They are self-confident and experience satisfac-tory and pleasurable relationships with others. Aggressive Behavior Individuals who are aggressive defend their own basic rights by violating the basic rights of others. Feelingsare often expressed dishonestly and inappropriately.They say what is on their mind, often at the expenseof others. Aggressive behavior commonly results in\"put-downs,\" leaving the receiver feeling hurt, defen-sive, and humiliated. Aggressive individuals devaluethe self-worth of others on whom they impose theirchoices. They express an air of superiority, and theirvoices are often loud, demanding, angry, or cold,without emotion. Eye contact may be \"to intimidateothers by staring them down.\" They want to increasetheir feeling of power by dominating or humiliatingothers. Aggressive behavior hinders interpersonal relationships. Passive-Aggressive Behavior Passive -aggressive individuals defend their own rights by expressing resistance and general obstructiveness in response to the expectations of others (Black & Andreasen, 2011). This kind of behavior is sometimesreferred to as indirect, or covert, aggression, and takes the form of passive, nonconfrontative action. These indi-viduals are devious, manipulative, and sly, and they un-dermine others with behavior that expresses theopposite of what they are feeling. They are highly crit-ical and sarcastic. They allow others to make choicesfor them, then resist by using passive behaviors, suchas procrastination, dawdling, stubbornness, and \"for-getfulness.\" They use actions instead of words to conveytheir message, and the actions express covert aggres-sion. They become sulky, irritable, or argumentativewhen asked to do something they do not want to do.They may protest to others about the demand but willnot confront the person who is making the demand.Instead, they may deal with the demand by \"forgetting\"to do it. The goal is domination through retaliation.This behavior offers a feeling of control and power, al-though passive-aggressive individuals actually feel re-sentment and that they are being taken advantage of.They possess extremely low self-confidence. A comparison of these four behavior patterns is presented in Table 14-2. Behavioral Components of Assertive Behavior Alberti and Emmons (2008) have identified severaldefining characteristics of assertive behavior: Eye contact. Eye contact is considered appropriate when it is intermittent (i.e., looking directly at theCHAPTER 14 Assertiveness Training 237 TABLE 14-1 Assertive Rights and Responsibilities RIGHTS RESPONSIBILITIES 1.To be treated with respect 2.To express feelings, opinions, and beliefs 3.To say \"no\" 4.To make mistakes 5.To be listened to 6.To change your mind 7.To ask for what you want 8.To put yourself first, sometimes 9.To set your own priorities 10.To refuse to justify feelings or behaviorTo treat others in a way that recognizes their human dignity To accept ownership of our feelings and show respect for those that differ from our own To analyze each situation individually, recognizing all human rights as equal (others have the right to say \"no,\" too) To accept responsibility for own mistakes and try to correct themTo listen to othersTo accept the possible consequences that the change may incur; to accept the same flexibility in others To accept others' right to refuse your requestTo put others first, sometimesTo consider one's limitations as well as strengths in directing independent activities, to be a dependable person To accept ownership of own feelings/behavior, to accept others without requiring justification for their feelings/behavior4092_Ch14_235-246 24/07/14 5:26 PM Page 237238 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care TABLE 14-2 Comparison of Behavioral Response Patterns Behavioral characteristics Examples Goals Feelings Compensation Outcomes SOURCES: Alberti & Emmons, 2008; Bishop, 2013; Davis, Eshelman, & McKay, 2008; Lloyd, 2002; and Powell & Enright, 1990.PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE Defends own rights with passive resist- ance, is critical andsarcastic; often ex-presses oppositeof true feelings \"Okay , I'll stay and work an extra s hift.\" (Then to peer:\"How dare she askme to work overagain!

It's someoneelse's turn today.\" To communicate effectively; to berespected by others success- self-respect, respectfor others, satisfy-ing interpersonalrelationships Goals met; desires most often defending as well asrights of othersNONA SSER TIVE P assive, does not ex- press true feelings,self-deprecating,denies own rights \"Uh, well, uh, sure, I'll be glad to stay andwork an extra shift. \" T o please others; to be liked by others Anxious, hurt, disap- pointed with self,angry, resentful Is able to avoid un- pleasant situationsand confrontationswith others Goals not met; expense;anger and resent-ment grow; feelsviolated and manipulated person to whom one is speaking but looking away now and then). Individuals feel uncomfortablewhen someone stares at them continuously and in-tently. Intermittent eye contact conveys the mes-sage that one is interested in what is being said. Body posture. Sitting and leaning slightly toward the other person in a conversation suggests an active in-terest in what is being said. Emphasis on an assertivestance can be achieved by standing with an erect pos-ture, squarely facing the other person. A slumpedposture conveys passivity or nonassertiveness. Distance/ physical contact. The distance between two individuals in an interaction or the physical contactbetween them has a strong cultural influence. Forexample, in the United States, intimate distance isconsidered approximately 18 inches from the body.We are very careful about whom we allow to enterthis intimate space. Invasion of this space may be in-terpreted by some individuals as very aggressive. Gestures. Nonverbal gestures may also be culturally related. Gesturing can add emphasis, warmth,depth, or power to the spoken word. Facial expression. Various facial expressions convey different messages (e.g., frown, smile, surprise,anger, fear). It is difficult to \"fake\" these messages.In assertive communication, the facial expressionis congruent with the verbal message. Voice. The voice conveys a message by its loudness, softness, degree and placement of emphasis, andevidence of emotional tone.4092_Ch14_235-246 24/07/14 5:26 PM Page 238Fluency. Being able to discuss a subject with ease and with obvious knowledge conveys assertiveness and self-confidence. This message is impeded by numerous pauses or filler words such as \"and,uh . . .\" or \"you know . . .\" Timing. Assertive responses are most effective when they are spontaneous and immediate. How-ever, most people have experienced times whenit was not appropriate to respond (e.g., in frontof a group of people) or times when an appropri-ate response is generated only after the fact (\"If only I had said . . .\"). Alberti and Emmons(2008, p. 77) stated that \"it is never too late to beassertive!\" It is correct and worthwhile to seek outthe individual at a later time and express the assertive response. Listening. Assertive listening means giving the other individual full attention by making eye con-tact, nodding to indicate acceptance of what isbeing said, and taking time to understand what isbeing said before giving a response. Thoughts. Cognitive processes affect one's as- sertive behavior. Two such processes are (1) anindividual's attitudes about the appropriatenessof assertive behavior in general and (2) the ap-propriateness of assertive behavior for himself orherself specifically. Content. Many times individuals do not respond to an unpleasant situation because \"I just didn't knowwhat to say.\" Perhaps what is being said is not as important as how it is said. Emotions should be expressed when they are experienced. It is also important to accept ownership of those emotionsand not devalue the worth of another individual toassert oneself. Persistence. This element of assertive behavior speaks to not giving up; that is, to refrain fromconcluding that the individual is not worth whatever it is he or she is pursuing. Alberti and Emmons (2008) suggest that all of the com-ponents of assertive behavior are important; \"the element of persistence simply means apply-ing them again, and again, and again, as needed.\"(p. 81) Techniques That Promote Assertive Behavior The following techniques have been shown to be effective in responding to criticism and avoiding manipulation by others. 1. Standing up for one's basic human rights. EXAMP LE \"I have the right to express my opinion.\" 2. Assuming responsibility for one's own statements.EXAMPLE \"I don't want to go out with you tonight,\" instead of \"I can'tgo out with you tonight.\" The latter implies a lack of power or ability. 3. Responding as a \"broken record. \" Persistently re- peating in a calm voice what is wanted. EXAMPLE Telephone salesperson: \"I want to help you save money by changing long-distance services.\" Assertive response: \"I don't want to change my long- distance service.\" Telephone salesperson: \"I can't believe you don't want to save money!\" Assertive response: \"I don't want to change my long- distance service.\" 4. Agreeing assertively. Assertively accepting negative aspects about oneself; admitting when an error hasbeen made. EXAMPLE Ms. Jones: \"You sure let that meeting get out of hand. What a waste of time.\" Ms. Smith: \"Yes, I didn't do a very good job of conducting the meeting today.\" 5. Inquiring assertively. Seeking additional informa- tion about critical statements. EXAMPLE Male board member: \"You made a real fool of yourself at the board meeting last night.\" Female board member: \"Oh, really? Just what about my behavior offended you?\" Male board member: \"You were so damned pushy!\" Female board member: \"Were you offended that I spoke up for my beliefs, or was it because my beliefs are in direct opposition to yours?\" 6. Shifting from content to process. Changing the focus of the communication from discussing the topic at hand to analyzing what is actually goingon in the interaction. EXAMPLE Wife: \"Would you please call me if you will be late for dinner?\" Husband: \"Why don't you just get off my back! I always have to account for every minute of my time with you!\" Wife: \"Sounds to me like we need to discuss some other things here. What are you really angry about?\" 7. Clouding/fogging. Concurring with the critic's argument without becoming defensive and with-out agreeing to change. EXAMPLE Nurse 1: \"You never come to the Nurses' Association meet- ings. I don't know why you even belong!\"CHAPTER 14 Assertiveness Training 2394092_Ch14_235-246 24/07/14 5:26 PM Page 239Nurse 2: \"You're right. I haven't attended very many of the meetings.\" 8. Defusing. Putting off further discussion with an angry individual until he or she is calmer . EXAMPLE \"You are very angry right now. I don't want to discuss this matter with you while you are so upset. I will discuss it withyou in my office at 3 o'clock this afternoon.\" 9. Delaying assertively. Putting off further discus- sion with another individual until one is calmer. EXAM PLE \"That's a very challenging position you have taken, Mr. Brown.I'll need time to give it some thought. I'll call you later thisafternoon.\" 10. Responding assertively with irony. EXAMPLE Man: \"I Using \"I\" statements. \"I\" statements allow an in- dividual to take ownership for his or her feelings rather than saying they are caused by anotherperson. \"I\" statements are sometimes called \"feeling\" state- ments. They express directly what an individual is feeling. \"Y ou\" statements are accusatory and put the receiver on the defensive. \"I\" statements have four parts: 1.How I feel: these are my feelings and I accept ownership of them. 2. When: describe in a neutral manner the behavior that is the problem. 3. Why: describe what it is about the behavior that is objectionable. 4. Suggest change: offering a pr eferred alternative to the behavior. EXAMPLE John has just returned from a hunting trip and walked into the living room in his muddy boots leaving a trail of mud onthe carpet. His wife, Mary, may respond as follows: With a \"you\" statement: \"You are such a jerk! Can't you see the trail of mud you are leaving on the carpet? I just cleanedthis carpet. You make me so angry!\" With an \"I\" statement: \"I feel so angry when you walk on the carpet in your muddy boots. I just cleaned it, and now I willhave to clean it again. I would appreciate it if you would re-move your boots on the porch before you come in the house.\" \"You\" statements are negative and focus on what the person has done wrong. They don't explain whatis being requested of the person. \"I\" statements are more positive. They explain how one is feeling, why he or she is feeling that way, and what the individual wants instead. Hopkins (2013) stated the followingabout the importance of \"I\" statements: Part of being assertive involves the ability to appro- priately express your needs and feelings. You can accomplish this by using \"I\" statements. These [state-ments] indicate ownership, do not attribute blame,focus on behavior, identify the effect of the behavior,are direct and honest, and contribute to the growthof your relationship with each other. (p. 2) Thought-Stopping Techniques Assertive thinking is sometimes inhibited by repeti- tive, negative thoughts of which the mind refuses tolet go. Individuals with low self-worth may be obsessedwith thoughts such as, \"I know he'd never want to go out with me. I'm too ugly (or plain, or fat, ordumb)\" or \"I just know I'll never be able to do thisjob well\" or \"I just can't seem to do anything right.\"This type of thinking fosters the belief that one's in-dividual rights do not deserve the same considerationas those of others, and reflects nonassertive commu-nication and behavioral response patterns. Thought -stopping techniques, as described here, were developed by psychiatrist Joseph Wolpe (1990)and are intended to eliminate intrusive, unwantedthoughts. Method In a practice setting, with eyes closed, the individualconcentrates on an unwanted recurring thought.Once the thought is clearly established in the mind,he or she shouts aloud: \"STOP!\" This action will in-terrupt the thought, and it is actually removed fromone's awareness. The individual then immediatelyshifts his or her thoughts to one that is consideredpleasant and desirable. It is possible that the unwanted thought may soon recur, but with practice, the length of time betweenrecurrences will increase until the unwanted thoughtis no longer intrusive. Obviously, one cannot go about his or her daily life shouting, \"STOP!\" in public places. After a numberof practice sessions, the technique is equally effectiveif the word \"stop!\" is used silently in the mind. Role of the Nurse in Assertiveness Training It is important for nurses to become aware of and recognize their own behavioral responses. Are theymostly nonassertive? Assertive? Aggressive? Passive-aggressive? Do they consider their behavioral respo nses240 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch14_235-246 24/07/14 5:26 PM Page 240effective? Do they wish to change? Remember, all in- dividuals have the right to choose whether or not theywant to be assertive. A self-assessment of assertivenessis found in Box 14-1. The ability to respond assertively is especially im- portant to nurses who are committed to further de-velopment of the profession. Assertive skills facilitatethe implementation of change\u2014change that is re-quired if the image of nursing is to be upgraded tothe level of professionalism that most nurses desire.Assertive communication is useful in the politicalarena for nurses who choose to become involved atboth state and national levels in striving to influencelegislation and, ultimately, to improve the system ofhealth-care provision in our country. Nurses who understand and use assertiveness skills themselves can in turn assist clients who wish to effectbehavioral change in an effort to increase self-esteemand improve interpersonal relationships. The nursingprocess is a useful tool for nurses who are involved inhelping clients increase their assertiveness. Assessment Nurses can help clients become more aware of theirbehavioral responses. Many tools for assessing thelevel of assertiveness have been attempted over the years. None have been very effective. Perhapsthis is because it is so difficult to generalize when at- tempting to measure assertive behaviors. Box 14-2and Figure 14-1 represent examples of assertivenessinventories that could be personalized to describelife situations of individual clients more specifically.Obviously, \"everyday situations that may require assertiveness\" are not the same for all individuals. Diagnosis Possible nursing diagnoses for individuals needing assistance with assertiveness include: 1.Coping, defensive 2.Coping, low 9.Social interaction, impaired 10.Social isolation Outcome Identification/Implementation The goal for nurses working with individuals needingassistance with assertiveness is to help them developCHAPTER 14 Assertiveness Training 241 BOX 14-1 An Assertiveness Quiz Assign a number to each item using the following scale: 1 = Never; 3 = Sometimes; 5 = Always _____ 1.

If your total score is 60 or higher, you have a consistently assertive philosophy and probably handle most situations well.2. If your total score is 45-5 9, you have a fairly assertive outlook but may benefit from some assertiveness training. 3. If your total score is 30-44, you may be assertive in some situations, but your natural response is either nonassertive or aggressive. Assertiveness training is suggested. 4. If your total score is 15-29, you have considerable difficulty being assertive. Assertiveness training is recommended. SOURCE: Lloyd, S.R. (2002). Developing positive assertiveness (3rd ed.).

Individu- als who do not feel good about themselves eitherallow others to violate their rights or cover up theirlow self-esteem by being overtly or covertly aggressive.Individuals should be given information regardingtheir individual human rights. They must know whatthese rights are before they can stand up for them. Outcome criteria would be derived from specific nursing diagnoses. Some examples include the fol-lowing. Timelines are individually determined. The client verbalizes and accepts responsibility forhis or her own behavior. The client is able to express opinions and disagreewith the opinions of others in a socially acceptablemanner and without feeling guilty. The client is able to verbalize positive aspects aboutself. The client verbalizes choices made in a plan tomaintain control over his or her life situation. The client approaches others in an appropriatemanner for one-to-one interaction. In a clinical setting, nurses can teach clients the techniques to use to increase their assertive responses.This can be done on a one-to-one basis or in groupsituations. Once these techniques have been dis-cussed, nurses can assist clients to practice themthrough role-playing. Each client should compose alist of specific personal examples of situations that cre-ate difficulties for him or her. These situations willthen be simulated in the therapy setting so that theclient may practice assertive responses in a nonthreat-ening environment. In a group situation, feedbackfrom peers can provide valuable insight about the effectiveness of the response. CLINICAL PEARL An important part of this type of intervention is to ensure that clients are aware of the differences among assertive, nonassertive, aggressive, and passive-aggressive behaviors in the same situation. When discussion is held aboutwhat the best (assertive) response would be, it is also importantto discuss the other types of responses as well, so that clientscan begin to recognize their pattern of response and make changes accordingly. CLINICAL EXAMPLE Linda comes to day hospital once a week to attend group ther- apy and assertiveness training. She has had problems with de-pression and low self-esteem. She is married to a man who isverbally abusive. He is highly critical, is seldom satisfied withanything Linda does, and blames her for negative conse-quences that occur in their lives, whether or not she is involved. Since the group began, the nurse who leads the assertive- ness training group has taught the participants about basichuman rights and the various types of response patterns.When the nurse asks for client situations to be presented ingroup, Linda volunteers to discuss an incident that occurredin her home this week. She related that she had just putsome chicken on the stove to cook for supper when her 7-year-old son came running in the house yelling that he hadbeen hurt. Linda went to him and observed that he had blood242 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care SOURCE: From Powell, T. J., & Enright, S. J. (1990). Anxiety and stress management.

You receive a compliment on your appearance or some- one praises your work? 2. You are criticized unfairly? 3. You are criticized legitimately by a superior?4. You have to confront a subordinate for continual lateness or sloppy work? 5. Your boss makes a sexual innuendo or makes a pass at you? IN PUBLIC How do you respond when: 1. In a restaurant, the food you ordered arrives cold or over- cooked? 2. A fellow passenger in a no-smoking compartment lights a cigarette? 3. You are faced with an unhelpful shop assistant?4. Somebody barges in front of you in a waiting line?5. You take an inferior article back to a shop?AMONG FRIENDS How do you respond when: 1. You feel angry with the way a friend has treated you?2. A friend makes what you consider to be an unreasonable request? 3. You want to ask a friend for a favor?4. You ask a friend for repayment of a loan of money?5. You have to negotiate with a friend on which film to see or where to meet? AT HOME How do you respond when: 1. One of your parents criticizes you?2.

He said he and some friends had been playing on the junglegym in the schoolyard down the street, and he had fallen andhit his head. Linda went with him to the bathroom to cleanthe wound and apply some medication. Her husband, Joe,was reading the newspaper in the living room. By the timeshe got back to the chicken on the stove, it was burned andinedible. Her husband shouted, \"You stupid woman! You can'tdo anything right!\" Linda did not respond but burst into tears. The nurse asked the other members in the group to present some ideas about how Linda could have responded to Joe's criticism. After some discussion, they agreed that Linda mighthave stated, \"I made a mistake. I am not stupid and I do lots ofthings right.\" They also discussed other types of responses andwhy they were less acceptable. They recognized that Linda's lack of verbal response and bursting into tears was a nonassertiveresponse. They also agreed on other examples, such as: 1. An aggressive response might be, \"Cook your own sup- per!\" and toss the skillet out the back door. 2. A passive-aggressive response might be to fix sandwiches for supper and not speak to Joe for 3 days.Practice on the assertive response began, with the nurse and various members of the group playing the role of Joe so that Linda could practice until she felt comfortable withthe response. She participated in the group for 6 months,regularly submitting situations with which she needed help.She also learned from the situations presented by othermembers of the group. These weekly sessions gave Lindathe self-confidence that she needed to stand up to Joe's criticism. She was aware of her basic human rights and, with practice, was able to stand up for them in an assertivemanner. She was happy to report to the group after a few months that Joe seemed to be less critical and that theirrelationship was improving. Evaluation Evaluation requires that the nurse and client assess whether or not these techniques are achieving the desired outcomes. Reassessment might include thefollowing questions: Is the client able to accept criticism without becom-ing defensive?CHAPTER 14 Assertiveness Training 243 DIRECTIONS: Fill in each block with a rating of your assertiveness on a 5-point scale. A rating of 0 means you have no difficulty asserting yourself. A rating of 5 means that you are completely unable to assert yourself.

Is the client able to decline a request without feel-ing guilty? Can the client verbalize positive qualities abouthimself or herself? Does the client verbalize improvement in interper-sonal relationships? Assertiveness training serves to extend and create more flexibility in an individual's communication styleso that he or she has a greater choice of responses invarious situations. Although change does not comeeasily, assertiveness training can be an effective way of changing behavior. Nurses can assist individuals to become more assertive, thereby encouraging themto become what they want to be, promoting an im-provement in self-esteem, and fostering a respect fortheir own rights and the rights of others. Summary and Key Points Assertive behavior helps individuals feel betterabout themselves by encouraging them to stand upfor their own basic human rights. Basic human rights have equal representation forall individuals. Along with rights comes an equal number of re-sponsibilities. Part of being assertive includes livingup to these responsibilities. Assertive behavior increases self-esteem and theability to develop satisfying interpersonal relation-ships. This is accomplished through honesty, di-rectness, appropriateness, and respecting one'sown rights, and the rights of others. Individuals develop patterns of responding in various ways, such as role modeling, by receivingpositive or negative reinforcement, or by consciouschoice. Patterns of responding can take the form ofnonassertiveness, assertiveness, aggressiveness, orpassive-aggressiveness. Nonassertive individuals seek to please others at the expense of denying their own basic human rights. Assertive individuals stand up for their own rights while protecting the rights of others. Those who respond aggressively defend their own rights by violating the basic rights of others. Individuals who respond in a passive- aggressive manner defend their own rights by expressing re-sistance to social and occupational demands. Some important behavioral considerations of as-sertive behavior include eye contact, body posture,distance/physical contact, gestures, facial expres-sion, voice, fluency, timing, listening, thoughts,content, and persistence. A discussion of techniques that have been devel-oped to assist individuals in the process of becom-ing more assertive was presented. Negative thinking can sometimes interfere withone's ability to respond assertively. Thought-stopping techniques help individuals removenegative, unwanted thoughts from awareness and promote the development of a more assertiveattitude. Nurses can assist individuals to learn and practiceassertiveness techniques. The nursing process is an effective vehicle for providing the information and support to clientsas they strive to create positive change in their lives.244 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Additional info available at www.davisplus.com Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

They state, \"Withoutsome measure of self-worth, life can be enormouslypainful, with many basic needs going unmet\" (p. 1). The awareness of self (i.e., the ability to form an identity and then attach a value to it) is an importantdifferentiating factor between humans and other an-imals. This capacity for judgment, then, becomes acontributing factor in disturbances of self-esteem. The promotion of self-esteem is about stopping self-judgments. It is about helping individuals changehow they perceive and feel about themselves. Thischapter describes the developmental progression and the verbal and behavioral manifestations of self-esteem. The concept of boundaries and its relation- ship to self-esteem is explored. Nursing care of clientswith disturbances in self-esteem is described in thecontext of the nursing process.and facial disfigurements. Functional alterations areconditions such as colostomy, paralysis, and impo-tence. Alterations in body image are often experi-enced as losses. Personal Identity This component of the self-concept is composed ofthe moral-ethical self, the self-consistency, and theself-ideal/self-expectancy. The moral-ethical self is that aspect of the personal identity that evaluates who the individual says he orshe is. This component of the personal self observes,compares, sets standards, and makes judgments thatinfluence an individual's self-evaluation. Self-consistency is the component of the personal identity that strives to maintain a stable self-image.Even if the self-image is negative, because of this needfor stability and self-consistency, the individual resistsletting go of the image from which he or she hasachieved a measure of constancy. Self-ideal/self-expectancy relates to an individual's perception of what he or she wants to be, to do, or tobecome. The concept of the ideal self arises out of theperception one has of the expectations of others. Dis-turbances in self-concept can occur when individualsare unable to achieve their ideals and expectancies.248 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care CORE CONCEPT Self-Concept Self-concept is the cognitive or thinking component of the self, and generally refers to the totality of a com-plex, organized, and dynamic system of learned beliefs,attitudes and opinions that each person holds to be trueabout his or her personal existence (Huitt, 2011). CORE CONCEPT Self-Esteem Self-esteem refers to the degree of regard or respect that individuals have for themselves and is a measureof worth that they place on their abilities and judgments. Components of Self-Concept Physical Self or Body Image An individual's body image is a subjective perception of one's physical appearance based on self-evaluation and on reactions and feedback from others. Gormanand Sultan (2008) state: Body image is the mental picture a person has of his or her own body. It significantly influences the way aperson thinks and feels about his or her body as awhole, about its functions, and about the internal andexternal sensations associated with it. It also includesperceptions of the way others see the person's bodyand is central to self-concept and self-esteem. (p. 9) An individual's body image may not necessarily coincide with his or her actual appearance. For exam- ple, individuals who have been overweight for manyyears and then lose weight often have difficulty per-ceiving of themselves as thin. They may even continueto choose clothing in the size they were before theylost weight. A disturbance in one's body image may occur with changes in structure or function. Examples of changesin bodily structure include amputations, mastectomy,Self-Esteem Warren (1991) stated: Self-esteem breaks down into two components: (1) the ability to say that \"I am important,\" \"I matter,\"and (2) the ability to say \"I am competent,\" \"I havesomething to offer to others and the world. (p. 1) Maslow (1970) postulated that individuals must achieve a positive self-esteem before they can achieve self-actualization (see Chapter 2). On a day-to-daybasis, one's self-value is challenged by changes withinthe environment. With a positive self-worth, individ-uals are able to adapt successfully to the demands as-sociated with situational and maturational crises thatoccur. The ability to adapt to these environmentalchanges is impaired when individuals hold themselvesin low esteem. Self-esteem is very closely related to the other components of the self-concept. Just as with bodyimage and personal identity, the development of4092_Ch15_247-260 23/07/14 12:04 PM Page 248self-esteem is largely influenced by the perceptions of how one is viewed by significant others. It beginsin early childhood and vacillates throughout the life span. Development of Self-Esteem How self-esteem is established has been the topic ofinvestigation for a number of theorists and clinicians.From a review of personality theories, Coopersmith(1981) identified the following antecedent conditionsof positive self-esteem: Power. It is important for individuals to have a feel- ing of control over their own life situation and anability to claim some measure of influence over thebehaviors of others. Significance. Self-esteem is enhanced when indi- viduals feel loved, respected, and cared for by sig-nificant others. Virtue. Individuals feel good about themselves when their actions reflect a set of personal, moral,and ethical values. Competence. Positive self-esteem develops out of one's ability to perform successfully or achieve self-expectations and the expectations of others. Consistently set limits. A structured lifestyle demonstrates acceptance and caring and providesa feeling of security. Warren (1991) outlined the following focus areas to be emphasized by parents and others who workwith children when encouraging the growth and development of positive self-esteem: A sense of competence. Everyone needs to feel skilled at something. Warren (1991) stated, \"Chil-dren do not necessarily need to be THE best at askill in order to have positive self-esteem; what theyneed to feel is that they have accomplished theirPERSONAL best effort\" (p. 1). Unconditional love. Children need to know that they are loved and accepted by family and friendsregardless of success or failure. This is demon-strated by expressive touch, realistic praise, andseparation of criticism of the person from criticismof the behavior. A sense of survival. Everyone fails at something from time to time. Self-esteem is enhanced whenindividuals learn from failure and grow in theknowledge that they are stronger for having expe-rienced it. Realistic goals. Low self-esteem can be the result of not being able to achieve established goals. In-dividuals may \"set themselves up\" for failure bysetting goals that are unattainable. Goals can beunrealistic when they are beyond a child's capa-bility to achieve, require an inordinate amount ofeffort to accomplish, and are based on exagger-ated fantasy. A sense of responsibility. Children gain positive self-worth when they are assigned areas of respon-sibility or are expected to complete tasks that theyperceive are valued by others. Reality orientation. Personal limitations abound within our world, and it is important for childrento recognize and achieve a healthy balance be-tween what they can possess and achieve, and whatis beyond their capability or control. Other factors that have been found to be influen- tial in the development of self-esteem include thefollowing: The responses of others. The development of self-esteem can be positively or negatively influ-enced by the responses of others, particularly sig-nificant others, and by how individuals perceivethose responses. Hereditary factors. Factors that are genetically determined, such as physical appearance, size, orinherited infirmity, can have an effect on the de-velopment of self-esteem. Environmental conditions. The development of self-esteem can be influenced by demands from theenvironment. For example, intellectual prowessmay be incorporated into the self-worth of an indi-vidual who is reared in an academic environment. Developmental Progression of Self-Esteem Through the Life Span The development of self-esteem progresses through- out the life span. Erikson's (1963) theory of person-ality development provides a useful framework forillustration (see Chapter 3). Erikson describes eighttransitional or maturational crises, the resolution ofwhich can have a profound influence on self-esteem.If a crisis is successfully resolved at one stage, the in-dividual develops healthy coping strategies that he orshe can draw on to help fulfill tasks of subsequentstages. When an individual fails to achieve the tasksassociated with a developmental stage, emotionalgrowth is inhibited, and he or she is less able to copewith subsequent maturational or situational crises. Trust versus Mistrust (Birth to 18 Months) The development of trust results in a feeling of con-fidence in the predictability of the environment.Achievement of trust results in positive self-esteemthrough the instillation of self-confidence, optimism,and faith in the gratification of needs. Unsuccessful resolution results in the individual experiencing emotional dissatisfaction with the selfand suspiciousness of others, thereby promoting negative self-esteem.CHAPTER 15 Promoting Self-Esteem 2494092_Ch15_247-260 23/07/14 12:04 PM Page 249Autonomy versus Shame and Doubt (18 Months to 3 Years) With motor and mental development come greater movement and independence within the environ-ment. The child begins active exploration and exper-imentation. Achievement of the task results in a senseof self-control and the ability to delay gratification,as well as a feeling of self-confidence in one's abilityto perform. This task remains unresolved when the child's in- dependent behaviors are restricted or when the childfails because of unrealistic expectations. Negative self-esteem is promoted by a lack of self-confidence, a lackof pride in the ability to perform, and a sense of beingcontrolled by others. Initiative versus Guilt (3 to 6 Years) Positive self-esteem is gained through initiative whencreativity is encouraged and performance is recog-nized and positively reinforced. In this stage, childrenstrive to develop a sense of purpose and the ability toinitiate and direct their own activities. This is the stage during which the child begins to develop a conscience. He or she becomes vulnerableto the labeling of behaviors as \"good\" or \"bad.\"Guidance and discipline that rely heavily on sham-ing the child creates guilt and results in a decreasein self-esteem. Industry versus Inferiority (6 to 12 Years) Self-confidence is gained at this stage through learn-ing, competing, performing successfully, and receiv-ing recognition from significant others, peers, andacquaintances. Negative self-esteem is the result of nonachieve- ment, unrealistic expectations, or when accomplish-ments are consistently met with negative feedback.The child develops a sense of personal inadequacy. Identity versus Role Confusion (12 to 20 Years) During adolescence, the individual is striving to rede-fine the sense of self. Positive self-esteem occurs whenindividuals are allowed to experience independenceby making decisions that influence their lives. Failure to develop a new self-definition results in a sense of self-consciousness, doubt, and confusionabout one's role in life. This can occur when adoles-cents are encouraged to remain in the dependentposition; when discipline in the home has beenoverly harsh, inconsistent, or absent; and whenparental support has been lacking. These conditionsare influential in the development of low self-esteem. Intimacy versus Isolation (20 to 30 Years) Intimacy is achieved when one is able to form a lastingrelationship or a commitment to another person, acause, an institution, or a creative effort (Murray,Zentner, & Yakimo, 2009). Positive self-esteem is promoted through this capacity for giving of oneselfto another. Failure to achieve intimacy results in behaviors such as withdrawal, social isolation, aloneness, andthe inability to form lasting intimate relationships.Isolation occurs when love in the home has been de-prived or distorted through the younger years, caus-ing a severe impairment in self-esteem. Generativity versus Stagnation (30 to 65 Years) Generativity promotes positive self-esteem throughgratification from personal and professional achieve-ments, and from meaningful contributions to others. Failure to achieve generativity occurs when earlier developmental tasks are not fulfilled and the individ-ual does not achieve the degree of maturity requiredto derive gratification out of a personal concern forthe welfare of others. He or she lacks self-worth andbecomes withdrawn and isolated. Ego Integrity versus Despair (65 Years to Death) Ego integrity results in a sense of self-worth and self-acceptance as one reviews life goals, accepting thatsome were achieved and some were not. The individ-ual has little desire to make major changes in how his or her life has progressed. Positive self-esteem isevident. Individuals in despair possess a sense of self- contempt and disgust with how life has progressed.They feel worthless and helpless, and they would liketo have a second chance at life. Earlier developmen-tal tasks of self-confidence, self-identity, and concernfor others remain unfulfilled. Negative self-esteemprevails. Manifestations of Low Self-Esteem Individuals with low self-esteem perceive themselvesto be incompetent, unlovable, insecure, and unworthy.The number of manifestations exhibited is influencedby the degree to which an individual experiences lowself-esteem. Roy (1976, 2009) categorized behaviorsaccording to the type of stimuli that give rise to thesebehaviors and affirmed the importance of includingthis type of information in the nursing assessment.Stimulus categories are identified as focal, contextual, and residual. A summary of these types of influencing factors is presented in Table 15-1. Focal Stimuli A focal stimulus is the immediate concern that is caus- ing the threat to self-esteem and the stimulus that isengendering the current behavior. Examples of focalstimuli include termination of a significant relation-ship, loss of employment, and failure to pass the nurs-ing state board examination.250 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch15_247-260 23/07/14 12:04 PM Page 250CHAPTER 15 Promoting Self-Esteem 251 TABLE 15-1 Factors That Influence Manifestations of Low Self-Esteem FOCAL 1.

Contextual Stimuli Contextual stimuli are all of the other stimuli pres- ent in the person's environment that contribute to the behavior being caused by the focal stimulus. Exam- ples of contextual stimuli related to the previouslymentioned focal stimuli might be a child of the re-lationship becoming emotionally disabled in re-sponse to the divorce, advanced age interfering withobtaining employment, or a significant other whostates, \"I knew you weren't smart enough to passstate boards.\"Residual Stimuli Residual stimuli are factors that may influence one's maladaptive behavior in response to focal and con-textual stimuli. An individual conducting a self-esteem assessment might presume from previousknowledge that certain beliefs, attitudes, experiences,or traits have an effect on client behavior, eventhough it cannot be clearly substantiated. For exam-ple, being reared in an atmosphere of ridicule anddeprecation may be affecting current adaptation tofailure on the state board examination.4092_Ch15_247-260 23/07/14 12:04 PM Page 251Symptoms of Low identified a number of behaviors man- ifested by the individual with low self-esteem. Thesebehaviors are presented in Box 15-1. Boundaries The word boundary is used to denote the personal space, both physical and psychological, that individu-als identify as their own. Boundaries are sometimesreferred to as limits: the limit or degree to which in-dividuals feel comfortable in a relationship. Bound-aries define and differentiate an individual's physicaland psychological space from the physical and psy-chological space of others. Boundaries help individuals define the self and are part of the individuation process. Individuals who areaware of their boundaries have a healthy self-esteembecause they must know and accept their inner selves.The inner self includes beliefs, thoughts, feelings, decisions, choices, experiences, wants, needs, sensa-tions, and intuitions. Types of physical boundaries include physical closeness, touching, sexual behavior, eye contact, privacy (e.g., mail, diary, doors, nudity, bathroom,telephone), and pollution (e.g., noise and smoke),among others. Examples of invasions of physicalboundaries are reading someone else's diary, smokingin a nonsmoking public area, and touching someonewho does not wish to be touched. Types of psychological boundaries include beliefs, feelings, choices, needs, time alone, interests, confi-dences, individual differences, and spirituality, amongothers. Examples of invasions of psychological bound-aries are being criticized for doing something differ-ently than others; having personal information sharedin confidence told to others; and being told one\"should\" believe, feel, decide, choose, or think in acertain way. Boundary Pliancy Boundaries can be rigid, flexible, or enmeshed. Thebehavior of dogs and cats can be a good illustrationof rigid boundaries and flexible boundaries. Most dogs want to be as close to people as possible. When\"their people\" walk into the room, the dog is likely to be all over them. They want to be where their people are and do what they are doing. Dogs havevery flexible boundaries. Cats, on the other hand, have very distinct bound- aries. They do what they want, when they want. Theydecide how close they will be to their people, andwhen. Cats take notice when their people enter aroom but may not even acknowledge their presence(until the cat decides the time is right). Their bound-aries are less flexible than those of dogs.252 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Adapted from Developing Positive Assertiveness, Third Edition, a Crisp series book by Sam R.

They keep others at a dis-tance and are difficult to communicate with. They re-ject new ideas or experiences, and often withdraw,both emotionally and physically. EXAMPLE Fred and Alice were seeing a marriage counselor because they were unable to agree on many aspects of raising theirchildren and it was beginning to interfere with their relation-ship. Alice runs a day-care service out of their home, andFred is an accountant. Alice states, \"He never once changeda diaper or got up at night with a child. Now that they areolder, he refuses to discipline them in any way.\" Fred re-sponds, \"In my family, my Mom took care of the house andkids and my Dad kept us clothed and fed. That's the way itshould be. It's Alice's job to raise the kids. It's my job to makethe money.\" Fred's boundaries are considered rigid becausehe refuses to consider the ideas of others, or to experiencealternative ways of doing things. Flexible Boundaries Healthy boundaries are flexible. That is, individuals must be able to let go of their boundaries and limitswhen appropriate. In order to have flexible bound-aries, one must be aware of who is considered safe andwhen it is safe to let others invade our personal space. EXAMPLE Nancy always takes the hour from 4 to 5 p.m. for her own. She takes no phone calls and tells the children that she isnot to be disturbed during that hour. She reads or takes along leisurely bath and relaxes before it is time to start dinner.Today her private time was interrupted when her 15-year-olddaughter came home from school crying because she hadnot made the cheerleading squad. Nancy used her privatetime to comfort her daughter who was experiencing a trau-matic response to the failure. Sometimes boundaries can be too flexible. Individ- uals with boundaries that are too loose are like chameleons. They take their \"colors\" from whomeverthey happen to be with at the time. That is, they allowothers to make their choices and direct their behavior. EXAMPLE At a cocktail party Diane agreed with one person that the winter had been so unbearable she had hardly been out ofthe house. Later at the same party, she agreed with anotherperson that the winter had seemed milder than usual. Enmeshed Boundaries Enmeshed boundaries occur when two people's boundaries are so blended together that neither can be sure where one stops and the other begins, or oneindividual's boundaries may be blurred with another's.The individual with the enmeshed boundaries may beunable to differentiate his or her feelings, wants, andneeds from the other person's. EXAMPLES 1. Fran's parents are in town for a visit. They say to Fran, \"Dear, we want to take you and Dave out to dinner tonight. What is your favorite restaurant?\" Fran automati-cally responds, \"Villa Roma,\" knowing that the Italianrestaurant is Dave's favorite. 2. If a mother has difficulty allowing her daughter to individ- uate, the mother may perceive the daughter's experi-ences as happening to her. For example, Aileen got herhair cut without her mother's knowledge. It was styledwith spikes across the top of her head. When her mothersaw it, she said, \"How dare you go around looking likethat! What will people think of me?\" Establishing Boundaries Boundaries are established in childhood. Unhealthy boundaries are the products of unhealthy, troubled,or dysfunctional families. The boundaries enclosepainful feelings that have their origin in the dysfunc-tional family and that have not been dealt with.McKay and Fanning (2000) explain the correlationbetween unhealthy boundaries and self-esteem dis-turbances and how they can arise out of negativerole models: Modeling self-esteem means valuing oneself enough to take care of one's own basic needs. When parentsput themselves last, or chronically sacrifice for theirkids, they teach them that a person is only worthy in-sofar as he or she is of service to others. When parentsset consistent, supportive limits and protect them-selves from overbearing demands, they send a mes-sage to their children that both are important andboth have legitimate needs. (p. 312) In addition to the lack of positive role models, un- healthy boundaries may also be the result of abuse or neglect. These circumstances can cause a delay inpsychosocial development. The individual must thenresume the grief process as an adult in order to con-tinue the developmental progression. They learn torecognize feelings, work through core issues, andlearn to tolerate emotional pain as their own. Theycomplete the individuation process, go on to develophealthy boundaries, and learn to appreciate theirself-worth. The Nursing Process Assessment Clients with self-esteem problems may manifest anyof the symptoms presented in Box 15-1. Someclients with disturbances in self-esteem will make CHAPTER 15 Promoting Self-Esteem 2534092_Ch15_247-260 23/07/14 12:04 PM Page 253direct statements that reflect guilt, shame, or negative self-appraisal, but often it is necessary forthe nurse to ask specific questions to obtain thistype of information. In particular, clients who haveexperienced abuse or other severe trauma oftenhave kept feelings and fears buried for years, andbehavioral manifestations of low self-esteem maynot be readily evident. Various tools for measuring self-esteem exist. One is presented in Box 15-2. This particular tool can beused as a self-inventory by the client, or it can beadapted and used by the nurse to format questionsfor assessing level of self-esteem in the client. Diagnosis/Outcome Identification NANDA International has accepted, for use andtesting, four nursing diagnoses that relate to self-esteem. These diagnoses are chronic low self-esteem, situational low self-esteem, risk for chroniclow self-esteem, and risk for situational low self-esteem (NANDA International, 2012). Each is described here with its definitions and definingcharacteristics.Chronic Low Self-Esteem Definition: Long-standing negative self-evaluating/ feelings about self or self-capabilities. Defining Characteristics Dependent on others' opinions Hesitant to try new situations Evaluation of self as unable to deal with events Hesitant to try new things Indecisive behavior Exaggerates negative feedback about self Lack of eye contact Nonassertive behavior Excessively seeks reassurance Overly conforming Expressions of guilt and shame Passive Frequent lack of success in life events Rejects positive feedback about self Situational Low Self-Esteem Definition: Development of a negative perception of self-worth in response to a current situation.254 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care BOX 15-2 Self-Esteem Inventory Place a check mark in the column that most closely describes your answer to each statement.

Evaluation Reassessment is conducted to determine if the nursing actions have been successful in achieving theobjectives of care. Evaluation of the nursing actionsfor the client with self-esteem disturbances may be facilitated by gathering information using the follow-ing types of questions: Is the client able to discuss past accomplishmentsand other positive aspects about his or her life? Does the client accept praise and recognition fromothers in a gracious manner? Is the client able to try new experiences without ex-treme fear of failure? Can he or she accept constructive criticism nowwithout becoming overly defensive and shifting theblame to others? Does the client accept personal responsibility forproblems, rather than attributing feelings and behaviors to others? Does the client participate in decisions that affecthis or her life? Can the client make rational decisions independently? Has he or she become more assertive in interper-sonal relations? Is improvement observed in the physical presenta-tion of self-esteem, such as eye contact, posture,changes in eating and sleeping, fatigue, libido,elimination patterns, self-care, and complaints ofaches and pains? Summary and Key Points Emotional wellness requires that an individual havesome degree of self-worth\u2014a perception that he orshe possesses a measure of value to self and others. Self-concept consists of body image, personal iden-tity, and self-esteem. Body image encompasses one's appraisal of per-sonal attributes, functioning, sexuality, wellness-illness state, and appearance. The personal identity component of self-conceptis composed of the moral-ethical self, the self-consistency, and the self-ideal. The moral-ethical self functions as observer, stan-dard setter, dreamer, comparer, and most of allevaluator of who the individual says he or she is. Self-consistency is the component of the personalidentity that strives to maintain a stable self-image. Self-ideal relates to an individual's perception ofwhat he or she wants to be, do, or become. Self-esteem refers to the degree of regard or re-spect that individuals have for themselves and is ameasure of worth that they place on their abilities4092_Ch15_247-260 23/07/14 12:04 PM Page 257and judgments. It is largely influenced by the perceptions of how one is viewed by significantothers. Predisposing factors to the development of positiveself-esteem include a sense of competence, uncon-ditional love, a sense of survival, realistic goals, a sense of responsibility, and reality orientation. Genetics and environmental conditions may alsobe influencing factors. The development of self-esteem progresses through-out the life span. Erikson's theory of personality development was used in this chapter as a frame-work for illustration of this progression. The behaviors associated with low self-esteem arenumerous. Stimuli that trigger behaviors associated with lowself-esteem were presented according to focal, con-textual, or residual types.Boundaries, or personal limits, help individuals de-fine the self and are part of the individuation process. Boundaries are physical and psychological and maybe rigid, flexible, or enmeshed. Unhealthy boundaries are often the result of dys-functional family systems. The nursing process is the vehicle for delivery ofcare to clients needing assistance with self-esteemdisturbances. The four nursing diagnoses relating to self-esteemthat have been accepted by NANDA Internationalinclude: chronic low self-esteem, situational lowself-esteem, risk for chronic low self-esteem, andrisk for situational low self-esteem.258 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

It is a normal human emotion that, when handled appro-priately and expressed assertively, can provide an in-dividual with a positive force to solve problems andmake decisions concerning life situations. Anger be-comes a problem when it is not expressed and whenit is expressed aggressively. Violence occurs when in-dividuals lose control of their anger. Violent acts arebecoming commonplace in the United States. Theyare reported daily by the news media, and health-careworkers see the results on a regular basis in the emer-gency departments of general hospitals.

Anger and Aggression, Defined Anger is a normal, healthy emotion that serves as awarning signal and alerts us to potential threat ortrauma. It triggers energy that sets us up for a goodfight or quick flight, and can range from mild irritationto hot, fiery energy (Butterfield, 2000). Warren (1999)outlines some fundamental points about anger: Anger is not a primary emotion, but it is typicallyexperienced as an almost automatic inner responseto hurt, frustration, or fear. Anger is physiological arousal. It instills feelings ofpower and generates preparedness. Anger and aggression are significantly different. The expression of anger is learned. The expression of anger can come under personalcontrol. Anger is a very powerful emotion. When it is de- nied or buried, it can precipitate a number of phys-ical problems such as migraine headaches, ulcers,colitis, and even coronary heart disease. Whenturned inward on oneself, anger can result in de-pression and low self-esteem. When it is expressedinappropriately, it commonly interferes with rela-tionships. When suppressed, anger may turn into resentment, which often manifests itself in negative,passive-aggressive behavior. Anger creates a state of preparedness by arousing the sympathetic nervous system. The activation of thissystem results in increased heart rate and blood pres-sure, increased secretion of epinephrine (resulting inadditional physiological arousal), glucose, among others. Anger prepares thebody, physiologically, to fight. When anger goes unre-solved, this physiological arousal can be the predispos-ing factor to a number of health problems. Even if thesituation that created the anger is removed by milesor years, it can be replayed through the memory, re-activating the sympathetic arousal when this occurs. Table 16-1 lists positive and negative functions of anger. CORE CONCEPT Anger Anger is an emotional state that varies in intensity from mild irritation to intense fury and rage. It is accompaniedby physiological and biological changes, such as in-creases in heart rate, blood pressure, and levels of thehormones epinephrine and norepinephrine (AmericanPsychological Association, 2013). CORE CONCEPT Aggression Aggression is a behavior intended to threaten or injure the victim's security or self-esteem. It means \"to goagainst,\" \"to attack.\" It is a response thataims at inflicting pain or injury on objects or persons.Whether the damage is caused by words, fists, orweapons, the behavior is virtually always designed topunish. It is frequently accompanied by bitterness,meanness, and ridicule. An aggressive person is oftenvengeful (Warren, 1999, pp. 119-120). TABLE 16-1 The Functions of Anger POSITIVE FUNCTIONS OR CONSTRUCTIVE USES NEGATIVE FUNCTIONS OR DESTR UCTIVE USES Anger energizes and mobilizes the body for self-defense. Communicated assertively , anger can promote conflict resolution. Anger arousal is a personal signal of threat or injustice against the self. The signal elicits coping responses to deal with the distress. Anger is constructive when it provides a feeling of control over a situation and the individual is able to assertively take charge of a situation. Anger is constructive when it is expressed assertively, serves to increase self-esteem, and leads to mutual understanding and forgiveness. SOURCES: Adapted from Gorman & Sultan (2008) and Waughfield (2002).Without cognitive input, anger may result in impulsive behavior, disregarding possible negative consequences. Communicated passive-aggressively or aggressively, conflict esca- lates, and the problem that created the conflict goes unresolved. Anger can lead to aggression when the coping response is dis- placement. Anger can be destructive if it is discharged againstan object or person unrelated to the true target of the anger. Anger can be destructive when the feeling of control is exagger- ated and the individual uses the power to intimidate others. Anger can be destructive when it masks honest feelings, weakens self-esteem, and leads to hostility and rage.4092_Ch16_261-273 23/07/14 12:06 PM Page 262The term anger often takes on a negative connota- tion because of its link with aggression. Aggression is one way individuals express anger. It is sometimesused to try to force someone into compliance with theaggressor's wishes, but at other times the only objec-tive seems to be the infliction of punishment andpain. In virtually all instances, aggression is a negativefunction or destructive use of anger. Predisposing Factors to Anger and Aggression A number of factors have been implicated in the wayindividuals express anger. Some theorists view ag-gression as purely biological, and some suggest thatit results from individuals' interactions with their en-vironments. It is likely a combination of both. Modeling Role modeling is one of the strongest forms of learn- ing. Children model their behavior at a very early ageafter their primary caregivers, usually parents. Howparents or significant others express anger becomesthe child's method of anger expression. Whether role modeling is positive or negative de- pends on the behavior of the models. Much has beenwritten about the abused child becoming physicallyabusive as an adult. Role models are not always in the home, however. Evidence supports the role of television violence as apredisposing factor to later aggressive behavior(American Psychological Association, 2004). TheAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (2012) has sug-gested that monitoring what children view and regu-lation of violence in the media are necessary toprevent this type of violent modeling. Operant Conditioning Operant conditioning occurs when a specific behavior is reinforced. A positive reinforcement is a responseto the specific behavior that is pleasurable or offers areward. A negative reinforcement is a response to thespecific behavior that prevents an undesirable resultfrom occurring. Anger responses can be learned through operant conditioning. For example, when a child wants some-thing and has been told \"no\" by a parent, he or shemight have a temper tantrum. If, when the tempertantrum begins, the parent lets the child have what iswanted, the anger has been positively reinforced (orrewarded). An example of learning by negative reinforcement follows: A mother asks the child to pick up her toysand the child becomes angry and has a tempertantrum. If, when the temper tantrum begins, themother thinks, \"Oh, it's not worth all this!\" and picksup the toys herself, the anger has been negatively re-inforced (the child was rewarded by not having topick up her toys). Neurophysiological Disorders Some research has implicated epilepsy of temporaland frontal lobe origin in episodic aggression and violent behavior (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Clientswith episodic dyscontrol often respond to anticonvul-sant medication. Tumors in the brain, particularly in the areas of the limbic system and the temporal lobes; trauma tothe brain, resulting in cerebral changes; and diseases,such as encephalitis (or medications that may effectthis syndrome), have all been implicated in the predisposition to aggression and violent behavior. A study by Lee and associates (1998) showed that destruction of the amygdaloid body in patients withintractable aggression resulted in a reduction in au-tonomic arousal levels and in the number of aggres-sive outbursts. Biochemical Factors Violent behavior may be associated with hormonaldysfunction caused by Cushing's disease or hyperthy-roidism (Tardiff, 2003). Studies have not supported acorrelation between violence and increased levels ofandrogens or alterations in hormone levels associatedwith hypoglycemia or premenstrual syndrome. Some research indicates that various neurotransmit- ters (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine,acetylcholine, and serotonin) may play a role in the facilitation and inhibition of aggressive impulses(Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Socioeconomic Factors High rates of violence exist within the subculture ofpoverty in the United States. This has been attributedto lack of resources, breakup of families, alienation,discrimination, and frustration (Tardiff, 2003). An ongoing controversy exists as to whether economicinequality or absolute poverty is most responsible forviolent behavior within this subculture. That is, doesviolence occur because individuals perceive them-selves as disadvantaged relative to other persons, ordoes violence occur because of the deprivation itself?These concepts are not easily understood and are stillunder investigation. Environmental Factors Physical crowding may be related to violencethrough increased contact and decreased defensiblespace (Tardiff, 2003). A relationship between heatand aggression also has been indicated (Anderson,CHAPTER 16 Anger/Aggression Management 2634092_Ch16_261-273 23/07/14 12:06 PM Page 2632001). Moderately uncomfortable temperature ap- pears to be associated with an increase in aggression,while extremely hot temperatures seem to decreaseaggression. A number of epidemiological studies have found a strong link between use of alcohol and violent be-havior. Other substances, including cocaine, am-phetamines, hallucinogens, and anabolic steroids,have also been associated with violent behavior(Tardiff, 2003). The Nursing Process Assessment Nurses must be aware of the symptoms associated withanger and aggression in order to make an accurateassessment. The best intervention is prevention, sorisk factors for assessing violence potential are alsopresented. Anger Anger can be associated with a number of typical be-haviors, including (but not limited to) the following: Frowning facial expression Clenched fists Low-pitched verbalizations forced through clenchedteeth Yelling and shouting Intense eye contact or avoidance of eye contact Easily offended Defensive response to criticism Passive-aggressive behaviors Emotional overcontrol with flushing of the face Intense discomfort; continuous state of tension Anger has been identified as a stage in the griev- ing process. Individuals who become fixed in thisstage may become depressed. In this instance, theanger is turned inward as a way for the individual tomaintain control over the pent-up anger. Because of the negative connotation to the word anger, some clients will not acknowledge that what they arefeeling is anger. These individuals need assistance to recognize their true feelings and to understandthat anger is a perfectly acceptable emotion when itis expressed appropriately.Aggression Aggression can arise from a number of feeling states,including anger, anxiety, guilt, frustration, or suspi-ciousness. Aggressive behaviors can be classified as mild (e.g., sarcasm), moderate (e.g., slammingdoors), severe (e.g., threats of physical violenceagainst others), or extreme (e.g., physical acts of violence against others). Aggression may be associ-ated with (but not limited to) the following definingcharacteristics: Pacing, restlessness Tense facial expression and body language Verbal or physical threats Loud voice, shouting, use of obscenities, argumentative Threats of homicide or suicide Increase in agitation, with overreaction to environ-mental stimuli Panic anxiety, leading to misinterpretation of theenvironment Disturbed thought processes; suspiciousness Angry mood, often disproportionate to the situation Kassinove & Tafrate (2002) stated, \"In contrast to anger, aggression is almost always goal directed andhas the aim of harm to a specific person or object. Ag-gression is one of the negative outcomes that mayemerge from general arousal and anger\" (pp. 40; 50) Intent is a requisite in the definition of aggression. It refers to behavior that is intended to inflict harm or destruction. Accidents that lead to unintentional harm or destruction are not considered aggression. Assessing Risk Factors Prevention is the key issue in the management of aggressive or violent behavior. The individual who becomes violent usually feels an underlying helpless-ness. Three factors that have been identified as impor-tant considerations in assessing for potential violenceinclude the following: 1.Past history of violence 2. Client diagnosis 3. Current behavior Past history of violence is widely recognized as a major risk factor for violence in a treatment setting. Alsohighly correlated with assaultive behavior is diagnosis.Diagnoses that have a strong association with violent behavior are schizophrenia, major depression, bipolardisorder, and substance use disorders (Friedman, 2006).Substance abuse, in addition to mental illness, com-pounds the increased risk of violence. Neurocognitivedisorders and antisocial, borderline, and intermittentexplosive personality disorders have also been associatedwith a risk for violent behavior.264 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care CORE CONCEPT Anger Management The use of various techniques and strategies to control responses to anger-provoking situations. The goal ofanger management is to reduce both the emotional feel-ings and the physiological arousal that anger engenders. 4092_Ch16_261-273 PM Page 264Novitsky, Julius, and Dubin (2009) state: The successful management of violence is predicated on an understanding of the dynamics of violence. Apatient's threatening behavior is commonly an over-reaction to feelings of impotence, helplessness, andperceived or actual humiliation. Aggression rarely occurs suddenly and unexpectedly. (p. 50) They describe a \"prodromal syndrome \" that is characterized by anxiety and tension, verbal abuse and profanity, and increasing hyperactivity. These escalating behaviors usually do not occur in stages butmost often overlap and sometimes occur simultane-ously. Behaviors associated with this prodromal stageinclude rigid posture; clenched fists and a raised voice; arguingand demanding; using profanity and threatening ver-balizations; agitation and pacing; and pounding andslamming. Most assaultive behavior is preceded by a period of increasing hyperactivity. Behaviors associatedwith the prodromal syndrome should be consideredemergent and demand immediate attention. Keenobservation skills and background knowledge foraccurate assessment are critical factors in predictingpotential for violent behavior. The Br\u00f8set ViolenceChecklist (BVC) is presented in Box 16-1. It is aquick, simple, and reliable checklist that can beused as a risk assessment for potential violence. Test-ing has shown a 63 percent accuracy for predictionof violence at a score of 2 and above (Almvik,Woods, & Rasmussen, 2000). De-escalation tech-niques are also included. Diagnosis/Outcome Identification NANDA International does not include a separatenursing diagnosis for anger. The nursing diagnosis of complicated grieving may be used when anger isexpressed inappropriately and the etiology is relatedto a loss. The following nursing diagnoses may be consid- ered for clients demonstrating inappropriate expres-sion of anger or aggression: Ineffective coping related to negative role model-ing and dysfunctional family system evidenced byyelling, name calling, hitting others, and tempertantrums as expressions of anger Risk for self-directed or other-directed violence related to having been nurtured in an atmosphereof violence; history of violence Outcome Criteria Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. The followingcriteria may be used for measurement of outcomes inthe care of the client needing assistance with manage-ment of anger and aggression. The client: Is able to recognize when he or she is angry, andseeks out staff/support person to talk about his orher feelings Is able to take responsibility for own feelings ofanger Demonstrates the ability to exert internal controlover feelings of anger Is able to diffuse anger before losing control Uses the tension generated by the anger in a con-structive manner Does not cause harm to self or othersCHAPTER 16 Anger/Aggression Management 265 BOX 16-1 The Br\u00f8set Violence Checklist Behaviors Score (Score 1 point for each behavior observed.

Outcome crite-ria, appropriate nursing interventions, and rationalesare included for each diagnosis. Evaluation Evaluation consists of reassessment to determine ifthe nursing interventions have been successful inachieving the objectives of care. The following typeof information may be gathered to determine the success of working with a client exhibiting inappro-priate expression of anger. Is the client able to recognize when he or she isangry now? Can the client take responsibility for these feelingsand keep them in check without losing control? Does the client seek out staff/support person totalk about feelings of anger when they occur? Is the client able to transfer tension generated bythe anger into constructive activities? Has harm to client and others been avoided? Is the client able to solve problems adaptively withoutundue frustration and without becoming violent?266 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Table 16-2 | CARE PLAN FOR THE INDIVIDUAL WHO EXPR ESSES ANGER INAPPROPRIATELY NURSING DIAGNOSIS: INEFFECTIVE COPING RELATED TO: Negative role modeling and dysfunctional family system EVIDENCED BY: Yelling, name calling, hitting others, and temper tantrums as expressions of anger OUTCOME CRITERIA NURSING INTERVENTIONS RATIONALE Client will be able to recognize anger in self and take responsibility before losing control.1.Remain calm when dealing with anangry client. 2.Set verbal limits on behavior . Clearly delineate the conseq u ences of inappropriate expression ofanger and always follow through. 3.Have the client keep a diary ofangry feelings, what triggered them, and how they were handled. 4.A void touching the client when he or she becomes ang ry . 5.Help the client determine the truesource of the anger . 6.It may be constructive to ignore ini-tial derogatory remarks by the client. 7.Help the client find alternate ways ofreleasing tension, such as physicaloutlets, and more appropriate waysof expressing anger , such as seeking out staff when feelings emerge.1.Anger expressed by the nurse willmost likely incite increased angerin the client. 2.Consistency in enforcing the con-sequences is essential if positiveoutcomes are to be achieved. Inconsistency creates confusionand encourages testing of limits. 3.This provides a more objectivemeasure of the problem. 4.The client may view touch asthreatening and could become violent. 5.Many times anger is being dis-placed onto a safer object or per-son.

The precursor to violence is anger, which is a normal human emotion, and need not necessarilybe a negative response. When used appropriately, anger can provide posi-tive assistance with problem solving and decision-making in everyday life situations. Violence occurs when individuals lose control oftheir anger. Anger is viewed as the emotional response to one'sperception of a situation. Anger is a very powerful emotion and, when denied or buried, can precipitate a number of psychophysiological disorders. When anger is turned inward on the self, it can result in depression.When expressed inappropriately, anger commonlyinterferes with interpersonal relationships. When anger is suppressed, it often turns to resentment. Anger generates a physiological arousal compara-ble to the stress response discussed in Chapter 1. Aggression is one way in which individuals expressanger. Aggression is behavior intended to threaten or injure the victim's security or self-esteem. Aggression can be physical or verbal, but it is virtually always designed to punish. Aggression is a negative function or destructive useof anger. Various predisposing factors to the way individualsexpress anger have been implicated. Some theo-rists suggest that the etiology is purely biological,whereas others believe it depends on psychologicaland environmental factors.270 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Table 16-2 | CARE PLAN FOR THE INDIVIDUAL WHO EXPR ESSES ANGER INA PPROPRIATELY\u2014cont'd OUTCOME CRITERIA NURSING INTERVENTIONS RATIONALE g. Ongoing assessment. As agita- tion decreases, assess client's readiness for restraint removalor reduction. W ith assistance from other staff members, re-move one restraint at a time,while assessing c lient's response. This minimizes the risk of injuryto client and staff. h. Staff debriefing. It is important when a client loses control forstaff to follow up with a discus-sion about the situation. Tardiff(2003) states, \"The violentepisode should be discussed interms of what happened, whatwould have prevented it, whyseclusion or restraint was used(if it was), and how the patientor the staff felt in terms of usingseclusion and restraint.\" (p. 1495).It is also important to discuss the situation with other clients whowitnessed the episode. It is im-portant that they understandwhat happened. Some clientsmay fear that they could be secluded or restrained at sometime for no apparent reason. g. Gradual removal of the restraints allows for testing of the client'sself-control. Client and staffsafety are of primary concern. h. Debriefing helps to diminish the emotional impact of the intervention. Mutual feedback isshared, and staff has an oppor-tunity to process and learn fromthe event.4092_Ch16_261-273 23/07/14 12:06 PM Page 270CHAPTER 16 Anger/Aggression Management 271 Some possible predisposing factors include role modeling, operant conditioning, neurophysiologi-cal disorders (e.g., brain tumors, trauma, or dis-eases), biochemical factors (e.g., increased levels ofandrogens or other alterations in hormone levelsand neurotransmitter involvement), socioeconomicfactors (e.g., living in poverty), and environmentalfactors (e.g., physical crowding, uncomfortable temperature, use of alcohol or drugs, and availabil-ity of firearms). Nurses must be aware of the symptoms associatedwith anger and aggression in order to make an accurate assessment.Prevention is the key issue in the management ofaggressive or violent behavior. Three elements have been identified as key risk factors in the potential for violence: (1) past historyof violence, (2) client diagnosis, and (3) currentbehaviors. Additional info available at www.davisplus.com Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1. John, age 27, was brought to the emergency department by two police officers. He smelled strongly of alcohol and was combative. His blood alcohol level was measured at 293 mg/dL.

HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT Please read the chapter and answer the following questions: 1. How do age, race, and gender affect suicide risk? 2. Your neighbor tells you he is going to visithis sister-in-law in the hospital. T he sister- in-law has been hospitalized after attempt-ing suicide. Y our neighbor asks, \"What should I say when I go to visit Jane?\" Whatsuggestions might you give him? 3. John's father committed suicide when Johnwas a teenager . John's wife, Mary, tells themental health nurse that she is afraid John\"inherited\" that predisposition from his father.How should the nurse respond to Mary? 4. The nurse notes that the mood of a clientbeing treated for depression and suicidalideation suddenly brightens and the client states, \"I feel fine now . I don't feel depressed anymore. \" Why would this statement alert the nurse of a potentialproblem? Suicide is not a diagnosis or a disorder; it is a behav- ior. The Judeo-Christian belief has been that life is agift from God and that taking it is strictly forbidden(Carroll-Ghosh, Victor, & Bourgeois, 2003). A recent,and more secular, view has influenced how some in-dividuals view suicide in our society. Growing supportfor an individual's right to choose death over pain hasbeen evidenced. Some individuals are striving to ad-vance the cause of physician-assisted suicides for theterminally ill. Can suicide be a rational act? Most peo-ple in our society do not yet believe that it can. More than 90 percent of all persons who commit or attempt suicide have a diagnosed mental disorder(National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH], 2013).This chapter explores suicide from an epidemiolog-ical and etiological perspective. Care of the suicidalclient is presented in the context of the nursingprocess.4092_Ch17_274-288 23/07/14 12:08 PM Page 274CHAPTER 17 The Suicidal Client 275 Historical Perspectives In ancient Greece, suicide was an offense against the state and individuals who committed suicide were de-nied burial in community sites (Minois, 2001). In theculture of the imperial Roman army, individualssometimes resorted to suicide to escape humiliationor abuse. In the Middle Ages, suicide was viewed as a selfish or criminal act (Minois, 2001). Individuals who com-mitted suicide were often denied cemetery burial andtheir property was confiscated and shared by thecrown and the courts (MacDonald & Murphy, 1991).The issue of suicide changed during the period ofthe Renaissance. Although condemnation was still ex-pected, the view became more philosophical, and intellectuals could discuss the issue more freely. Most philosophers of the 17th and 18th centuries condemned suicide, but some writers recognized aconnection between suicide and melancholy or othersevere mental disturbances (Minois, 2001). Suicidewas illegal in England until 1961, and only in 1993was it decriminalized in Ireland. Most religions consider suicide as a sin against God. Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, andBuddhism all condemn suicide. In 1995, Pope JohnII restated Church opposition to suicide, euthanasia,and abortion as crimes against life, not unlike homi-cide and genocide (Tondo & Baldessarini, 2001).Epidemiological Factors More than 38,000 people committed suicide in 2010,the latest year for which statistics have been recorded(American Foundation for Suicide Prevention [AFSP],2013). This is the highest rate of suicide in 15 years.These statistics have established suicide as the thirdleading cause of death (behind accidents and homi-cide) among young Americans ages 15 to 24 years, thefourth leading cause of death for ages 25 to 44, theeighth leading cause of death for individuals ages45 to 64, and the tenth leading cause of death overall(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC],2013). Many more people attempt suicide than suc-ceed, and countless others seriously contemplate theact without carrying it out. Suicide has become a majorhealth-care problem in the United States today. Over the years confusion has existed over the re- ality of various notions regarding suicide. Somefacts and fables relating to suicide are presented inTable 17-1. Risk Factors Marital Status The suicide rate for single persons is twice that ofmarried persons. Divorced, separated, or widowedpersons have rates four to five times greater thanthose of the married (Jacobs et al., 2006). TABLE 17-1 Facts and Fables About Suicide FABLES People who talk about suicide do not commit suicide. Suicide happens without warning. You cannot stop a suicidal person. He or she is fully intent on dying. Once a person is suicidal, he or she is suicidal forever . Improvement after severe depression means that the suicidal risk is over. Suicide is inherited, or \"runs in families.\" All suicidal individuals are mentally ill, and suicide is the act of a psychotic person.FACTS Eight out of 10 people who kill themselves have given definite clues and warnings about their suicidal inten- tions. V e ry subtle clues may be ignored or disregarded by others. Most suicidal people are very ambivalent about their feelings regarding living or dying. Most are \"gambling with death\"and see it as a cry for someone to save them. People who want to kill themselves are only suicidal for a lim- ited time. If they are saved from feelings of self-destruction,they can go on to lead normal lives. Most suicides occur within about 3 months after the begin- ning of \"improvement,\" when the individual has the energyto carry out suicidal intentions. Suicide is not inherited. It is an individual matter and can be prevented. However, suicide by a close family memberincreases an individual's risk factor for suicide. Although suicidal persons are extremely unhappy, they are not necessarily psychotic. They are merely unable at thatpoint in time to see an alternative solution to what theyconsider an unbearable problem. Continued4092_Ch17_274-288 23/07/14 12:08 PM Page 275Gender Women attempt suicide more, but men succeed more often. Successful suicides number about 70 percentfor men and 30 percent for women. This has to dowith the lethality of the means. Women tend to over-dose; men use more lethal means such as firearms. Inthe United States, from 1970 to 2008, annual suiciderates per 100,000 rose from 16.8 to 19.0 in men, butdecreased from 6.6 to 4.9 in women (National Centerfor Health Statistics [NCHS], 2012). These differ-ences between men and women may also reflect a ten-dency for women to seek and accept help fromfriends or professionals, whereas men often view help-seeking as a sign of weakness. Age Suicide risk and age are positively correlated. This isparticularly true with men. Although rates amongwomen remain fairly constant throughout life, ratesamong men show a higher age correlation. The ratesrise sharply during adolescence, peak between 40 and50, and level off until age 65, when rates rise again forthe remaining years (NCHS, 2012). The suicide rate among young people ages 15 to 19 peaked in 1990 at 11.1 per 100,000 and declinedto 7.5 per 100,000 in 2008 (NCHS, 2012). Several fac-tors put adolescents at risk for suicide, including im-pulsive and high-risk behaviors, untreated mooddisorders (e.g., major depression and bipolar disor-der), access to lethal means (e.g., firearms), and sub-stance abuse. The latest statistics from the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention indicate that themost common method of completed suicide for ado-lescent males is firearm; for adolescent females it issuffocation (CDC, 2012). The suicide rate for the elderly peaked in 1990 at 20.5 per 100,000 and declined to 14.8 per 100,000 in2008 (NCHS, 2012). While the elderly make up justover 13 percent of the population, they account for al-most 15 percent of all suicides. White males over theage of 80 are at the greatest risk of all age/gender/racegroups. Eighty-four percent of elderly suicides aremale, which is 5.25 times greater than for females, andfirearms are the most common means of committingsuicide (American Association of Suicidology, 2013).The overall rate of suicide for females declines afterage 65. Religion Historically, suicide rates among Roman Catholicpopulations have been lower than rates amongProtestants and Jews (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Astudy published in the Journal of Affective Disorders re- vealed that men and women who consider them-selves affiliated with a religion are less likely toattempt suicide than their nonreligious counter-parts (Rasic et al., 2009). The authors found that re-ligious attendance is associated with decreasedsuicide attempts in both the general population andin those with a mental illness, independent of theavailability of social support systems. Socioeconomic Status Individuals in the very highest and lowest socialclasses have higher suicide rates than those in the mid- dle classes (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). With regard to occupation, suicide rates are higher among physicians,artists, dentists, law enforcement officers, lawyers, andinsurance agents. Ethnicity With regard to ethnicity, statistics show that whitesare at highest risk for suicide, followed by NativeAmericans, African Americans, Hispanic Americans,and Asian Americans (NCHS, 2012). Other Risk Factors As previously stated, more than 90 percent of peoplewho kill themselves have a diagnosable mental disor-der, most commonly a mood disorder or a substanceabuse disorder (NIMH, 2013). Suicide risk may in-crease early during treatment with antidepressants, as276 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care TABLE 17-1 Facts and Fables About Suicide\u2014cont'd FABLES Suicidal threats and gestures should be considered manipulative or attention-seeking behavior, and should not be taken seriously . People usually commit suicide by taking an overdose of drugs. If an individual has attempted suicide, he or she will not do it again. SOURCES: Corr & Corr (2013); Friends for Survival, Inc. (2013); and The Samaritans (2013).FACTS All suicidal behavior must be approached with the gravity of the potential act in mind. Attention should be gi ven to the possibility that the individual is issuing a cry for help. Gunshot wounds are the leading cause of death among suicide victims. Between 50% and 80% of all people who ultimately kill themselves have a history of a previous attempt.4092_Ch17_274-288 23/07/14 12:08 PM Page 276CHAPTER 17 The Suicidal Client 277 the return of energy brings about an increased ability to act out self-destructive wishes. Other psychiatric dis-orders that may account for suicidal behavior includeschizophrenia, personality disorders, and anxiety dis-orders (Jacobs et al., 2006). Severe insomnia is associated with increased sui- cide risk, even in the absence of depression. Use ofalcohol, and particularly a combination of alcoholand barbiturates, increases the risk of suicide. Psy-chosis, especially with command hallucinations, posesa higher than normal risk. Affliction with a chronicpainful or disabling illness also increases the risk ofsuicide. Several studies have indicated a higher risk factor for suicide among gay men and lesbians (Cochran &Mays, 2000; Eisenberg & Resnick, 2006; King et al., 2008; Medscape Psychiatry, 2011). It is thoughtthat this increased risk may be a function of the socialstigma and discrimination associated with the gay andlesbian orientation. Additional personal stressors, in-cluding isolation, victimization, and stressful interper-sonal relationships with family, peers, and community,are not uncommon. A report by the Suicide Preven-tion Resource Center (2008) states: Research indicates that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth have significantly higher rates of suicideattempts and suicidal ideation than their heterosex-ual peers. Data limitations make it difficult to drawconclusions about higher rates of death by suicideamong LGB youth; however, the higher number ofsuicide attempts, as well as the seriousness of attemptsamong LGB youth, make it probable that this groupof youth has a higher rate of suicide deaths than theirheterosexual counterparts. (p. 19) Higher risk is also associated with a family history of suicide, especially in a same-gender parent. Persons who have made prior suicide attempts are at higherrisk for suicide. About half of individuals who killthemselves have previously attempted suicide. Loss of a loved one through death or separation and lackof employment or increased financial burden also increase risk. In recent years, a number of suicides have been reported in the media among young people who arethe victims of bullying. Klomek, Sourander, andGould (2011) report: Studies among middle school and high school stu- dents show an increased risk of suicidal behavioramong bullies and victims. Both perpetrators and vic-tims are at the highest risk for suicidal ideation. Being bullied via the Internet or e-mail (called cyberbullying ) has also been associated with increased risk of depression and suicidal behavior among young people. Researchers found that both perpetrators andvictims of cyberbullying had more suicidal ideationand were more likely to attempt suicide than thosewho had not experienced such forms of peer aggres-sion (Hinduja & Patchin, 2010). Predisposing Factors: Theories of Suicide Psychological Theories Anger Turned Inward Freud (1957) believed that suicide was a response tothe intense self-hatred that an individual possessed.The anger had originated toward a love object but wasultimately turned inward against the self. Freud be-lieved that suicide occurred as a result of an earlierrepressed desire to kill someone else. He interpretedsuicide to be an aggressive act toward the self thatoften was really directed toward others. Hopelessness Carroll-Ghosh and associates (2003) identified hope-lessness as a central underlying factor in the predis-position to suicide. Beck, Brown, and Berchick (1990)also found a high correlation between hopelessnessand suicide. Desperation and Guilt Hendin (1991) identified desperation as another im-portant factor in suicide. With desperation, an indi-vidual feels helpless to change, but he or she also feelsthat life is impossible without such change. Guilt andself-recrimination are other aspects of desperation.These affective components were found to be promi-nent in Vietnam veterans with post-traumatic stressdisorder exhibiting suicidal behaviors (Carroll-Ghoshet al., 2003). History of Aggression and Violence Some studies have indicated that violent behavioroften goes hand-in-hand with suicidal behavior(Carroll-Ghosh et al., 2003). These studies correlatethe suicidal behavior in violent individuals to con-scious rage, therefore citing rage as an importantpsychological factor underlying the suicidal behavior(Hendin, 1991). Shame and Humiliation Some individuals have viewed suicide as a \"face-saving\"mechanism\u2014a way to prevent public humiliation fol-lowing a social defeat such as a sudden loss of statusor income. Often these individuals are too embar-rassed to seek treatment or other support systems. Developmental Stressors Rich, Warsradt, and Nemiroff (1991) have associateddevelopmental level with certain life stressors andtheir correlation to suicide. The stressors of conflict,4092_Ch17_274-288 23/07/14 12:08 PM Page 277278 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care separation, and rejection are associated with suicidal behavior in adolescence and early adulthood. Theprincipal stressor associated with suicidal behavior inthe 40- to 60-year-old group is economic problems.Medical illness plays an increasingly significant roleafter age 60 and becomes the leading predisposingfactor to suicidal behavior in individuals older thanage 80. Sociological Theory Durkheim (1951) studied the individual's interactionwith the society in which he or she lived. He believedthat the more cohesive the society, and the more thatthe individual felt an integrated part of the society, theless likely he or she was to commit suicide. Durkheimdescribed three social categories of suicide: Egoistic suicide is the response of the individual who feels separate and apart from the mainstream of society. Integration is lacking and the individualdoes not feel a part of any cohesive group (such asa family or a church). Altruistic suicide is the opposite of egoistic suicide. The individual who is prone to altruistic suicide isexcessively integrated into the group. The groupis often governed by cultural, religious, or politicalties, and allegiance is so strong that the individualwill sacrifice his or her life for the group. Anomic suicide occurs in response to changes that occur in an individual's life (e.g., divorce, loss of job)that disrupt feelings of relatedness to the group. Aninterruption in the customary norms of behavior in-stills feelings of \"separateness,\" and fears of beingwithout support from the formerly cohesive group. Biological Theories Genetics Twin studies have shown a much higher concordancerate for monozygotic twins than for dizygotic twins.Some studies with suicide attempters have focused onthe genotypic variations in the gene for tryptophanhydroxylase, with results indicating significant associ-ation to suicidality (Abbar et al., 2001). These resultssuggest a possible existence of genetic predispositiontoward suicidal behavior. Neurochemical Factors A number of studies have been conducted to deter-mine if there is a correlation between neurochemi-cal functioning in the central nervous system (CNS)and suicidal behavior. Some studies have revealed adeficiency of serotonin (measured as a decrease inthe levels of 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid [5-HIAA]of the cerebrospinal fluid) in depressed clients whoattempted suicide (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Somechanges in the noradrenergic system of suicide vic-tims have also been reported. Application of the Nursing Process With the Suicidal Client Assessment The following items should be considered when con-ducting a suicidal assessment: demographics, present-ing symptoms/medical-psychiatric diagnosis, suicidalideas or acts, interpersonal support system, analysis ofthe suicidal crisis, psychiatric/medical/family history,and coping strategies. Dr. David Satcher, as SurgeonGeneral of the United States, in his \"Call to Action toPrevent Suicide,\" spoke of risk factors and protectivefactors (U.S. Public Health Service, 1999). Risk fac-tors are associated with a greater potential for suicideand suicidal behavior, whereas protective factors areassociated with reduced potential for suicide. Theserisk and protective factors are outlined in Box 17-1.Table 17-2 presents some additional guidelines for de-termining the degree of suicide potential. Demographics The following demographics are assessed: Age. Suicide is highest in persons older than 50. Adolescents are also at high risk. Gender. Males are at higher risk than females. Ethnicity. Caucasians are at higher risk than are Native Americans, who are at higher risk thanAfrican Americans. Marital status. Single, divorced, and widowed are at higher risk than married. Socioeconomic status. Individuals in the highest and lowest socioeconomic classes are at higher riskthan those in the middle classes. Occupation. Professional health-care personnel and business executives are at highest risk. Method. Use of firearms presents a significantly higher risk than overdose of substances. Religion. Individuals who are not affiliated with any religious group are at higher risk than those whohave this type of affiliation. Family history. Higher risk if individual has family history of suicide. Presenting Symptoms/Medical-Psychiatric Diagnosis Assessment data must be gathered regarding any psy-chiatric or physical condition for which the client isbeing treated. Mood disorders (major depressionand bipolar disorders) are the most common disor-ders that precede suicide. Individuals with substanceuse disorders are also at high risk. Other psychiatricdisorders in which suicide may be a risk include anx-iety disorders, schizophrenia, and borderline and4092_Ch17_274-288 23/07/14 12:08 PM Page 278CHAPTER 17 The Suicidal Client 279 From U.S. Public Health Service (1999).

Other chronic and terminal physical illnesses havealso precipitated suicidal acts. Suicidal Ideas or Acts How serious is the intent? Does the person have aplan? If so, does he or she have the means? Howlethal are the means? Has the individual ever at-tempted suicide before? These are all questions thatmust be answered by the person conducting the sui-cidal client assessment. Individuals may leave both behavioral and verbal clues as to the intent of their act. Examples of behav-ioral clues include giving away prized possessions, get-ting financial affairs in order, writing suicide notes, orsudden lifts in mood (may indicate a decision to carryout the intent). Verbal clues may be both direct and indirect. Ex- amples of direct statements include \"I want to die\" or\"I'm going to kill myself.\" Examples of indirect state-ments include \"This is the last time you'll see me,\" \"I won't be around much longer for the doctor tohave to worry about,\" or \"I don't have anything worthliving for anymore.\" Other assessments include determining whether the individual has a plan, and if so, whether he or shehas the means to carry out that plan. If the personstates the suicide will be carried out with a gun, doeshe or she have access to a gun? Bullets? If pills areplanned, what kind of pills? Are they accessible? Interpersonal Support System Does the individual have support persons on whomhe or she can rely during a crisis situation? Lack of ameaningful network of satisfactory relationships mayimplicate an individual as a high risk for suicide dur-ing an emotional crisis. Analysis of the Suicidal Crisis The precipitating stressor: Adverse life events in combination with other risk factors such as de-pression may lead to suicide. Life stresses accom-panied by an increase in emotional disturbanceinclude the loss of a loved person either by deathor by divorce, problems in major relationships,changes in roles, or serious physical illness. Relevant history: Has the individual experienced numerous failures or rejections that would increasehis or her vulnerability for a dysfunctional responseto the current situation? Life-stage issues: The ability to tolerate losses and disappointments is often compromised if thoselosses and disappointments occur during variousstages of life in which the individual struggles withdevelopmental issues (e.g., adolescence, midlife). Psychiatric/Medical/Family History The individual should be assessed with regard to pre-vious psychiatric treatment for depression, alco-holism, or for previous suicide attempts. Medicalhistory should be obtained to determine presence ofchronic, debilitating, or terminal illness. Is there a his-tory of depressive disorder in the family, and has aclose relative committed suicide in the past? Coping Strategies How has the individual handled previous crisis situa-tions? How does this situation differ from previousones? Diagnosis/Outcome Identification Nursing diagnoses for the suicidal client may includethe following: Risk for suicide related to feelings of hopelessnessand desperation. Hopelessness related to absence of support systemsand perception of worthlessness. Outcome Criteria Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. The followingcriteria may be used for measurement of outcomes inthe care of the suicidal client. The client: 1.Has experienced no physical harm to self 2. Sets realistic goals for self 3. Expresses some optimism and hope for the future280 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care TABLE 17-2 Assessing the Degree of Suicidal Risk\u2014cont'd BEHAVIOR INTENSITY OF RISK LOW MODERATE HIGH HostilitySuicidal plan From Hatton, C.L., Valente, S.M., & Rink, A.

Ask client directly: \"Have you thought about harming your self in any way? If so, what do you plan to do? Do you have the means to carry out this plan?\" 2.Create a safe environment for theclient. Remove all potentially harm-ful objects from client's access(sharp objects, straps, belts, ties,glass items, alcohol). Superviseclosely during meals and medica-tion administration. P e rform room searches as deemed necessary. 3.Formulate a short-term verbal orwritten contract that the client willnot harm self . W hen time is up, make another, and so forth. Securea promise that the client will seekout staff when feeling suicidal. 4.Maintain close observation ofclient. Depending on level of sui-cide precaution, provide one-to-one contact, constant visual observation, or every-1 5-minute checks. Place in room close tonurse's station; do not assign toprivate room. Accompany to off-unit activities if attendance is indi-cated. May need to accompany to bathroom. 5.Maintain special care in administra-tion of medications. 6.Make rounds at frequent, irregular intervals (especially at night, to-ward early morning, at change ofshift, or other predictably busytimes for staff).1.T he risk of suicide is greatly in- creased if the client has developeda plan and par ticularly if means exist for the client to execute the plan. 2.Client safety is a nursing priority . 3.A degree of the responsibility forhis or her safety is gi ven to the client. Increased feelings of self-worth may be experienced whenclient feels accepted uncondition-ally regardless of thoughts or behavior. 4.Close observation is necessary toensure that client does not harmself in any way .

Guidelines for treat- ment of the suicidal client on an outpatient basis include the following: The person should not be left alone. Arrangementsmust be made for the client to stay with family orfriends. If this is not possible, hospitalizationshould be reconsidered. Establish a no-suicide contract with the client. For-mulate a written contract that the client will notharm himself or herself in a stated period of time.For example, the client writes, \"I will not harm my-self in any way between now and the time of our nextcounseling session,\" or \"I will call the suicide hotline(or go to the emergency room) if I start to feel likeharming myself.\" When the time period of thisshort-term contract has lapsed, a new contract is ne-gotiated. NOTE: Some clinicians believe that suicide prevention contracting is not helpful (Knoll, 2011).Obviously, the contract for safety comes with noguarantee, and it holds no legal credibility. It shouldnever be used as a single intervention, but can beviewed as one among many that serve to ensure theclient's safety. Garvey and associates (2009) stated: Contracts should be considered for use only in patients who are deemed capable of giving informed consentand, even in these circumstances, should be used withcaution. A contract should never replace a thoroughassessment of a patient's suicide risk factors. (p. 363) Enlist the help of family or friends to ensure that the home environment is safe from dangerous items,such as firearms or stockpiled drugs. Give supportpersons the telephone number of the counselor, oran emergency contact person in the event that thecounselor is not available. Appointments may need to be scheduled daily orevery other day at first until the immediate suicidalcrisis has subsided. Establish rapport and promote a trusting relation-ship. It is important for the suicide counselor to be-come a key person in the client's support system atthis time. Accept the client's feelings in a nonjudgmentalmanner. CLINICAL PEARL Be direct. Talk openly and matter-of-factly about suicide. Listen actively and encourage expression of feelings, including anger. Discuss the current crisis situation in the client's life. Use the problem-solving approach (see Chap-ter 13). Offer alternatives to suicide. Macnab(1993) suggested the following statements: [It is my belief that] you are incorrect in your belief that suicide is the only and the best solution to your problem. There are alternatives, and they are good. What is more, you will be aliveto test them. (p. 265) Help the client identify areas of the life situation that are within his or her control and those that theclient does not have the ability to control. Discussfeelings associated with these control issues. It isimportant for the client to feel some control overhis or her life situation in order to perceive a meas-ure of self-worth. The physician may prescribe antidepressants for anindividual who is experiencing suicidal depression.It is wise to prescribe no more than a 3-day supplyof the medication with no refills. The prescriptioncan then be renewed at the client's next counselingsession. NOTE: Sadock and Sadock (2007) stated: As the depression lifts, patients become energized and are thus able to put their suicidal plans into ac-tion. Sometimes, depressed patients, with or withouttreatment, suddenly appear to be at peace with them-selves because they have reached a secret decision tocommit suicide. Clinicians should be especially sus-picious of such a dramatic clinical change, which mayportend a suicidal attempt. (p. 905) Macnab (1993) suggests the following steps in crisis counseling with the suicidal client: Focus on the current crisis and how it can be alle-viated. Identify the client's appraisals of howthings are, and how things will be. Note how theseappraisals change in changing contexts. Note the client's reactivity to the crisis and howthis can be changed. Discuss strategies and pro-cedures for the management of anxiety, anger,and frustration. Work toward restoration of the client's self-worth, status, morale, and control. Introduce alternatives to suicide. Rehearse cognitive reconstruction\u2014more posi-tive ways of thinking about the self, events, thepast, the present, and the future. Identify experiences and actions that affirm self-worth and self-efficacy. Encourage movement toward the new reality,with the coping skills required to manageadaptively. Be available for ongoing therapeutic support andgrowth. Information for Family and Friends of the Suicidal Client The following suggestions are made for family and friends of an individual who is suicidal: Take any hint of suicide seriously. Anyone express-ing suicidal feelings needs immediate attention.4092_Ch17_274-288 23/07/14 12:08 PM Page 283Do not keep secrets. If a suicidal person says, \"Promise you won't tell anyone,\" do not make thatpromise. Suicidal individuals are ambivalent aboutdying, and suicidal behavior is a cry for help. It isthat ambivalence that leads the person to confideto you the suicidal thoughts. Get help for the per-son and for you. 1-800-SUICIDE is a national hot-line that is available 24 hours a day. Be a good listener. If people express suicidalthoughts or feel depressed, hopeless, or worthless,be supportive. Let them know you are there forthem and are willing to help them seek profes-sional help. Many people find it awkward to put into words howanother person's life is important for their ownwell-being, but it is important to stress that the per-son's life is important to you and to others. Empha-size in specific terms the ways in which the person'ssuicide would be devastating to you and to others. Express concern for individuals who expressthoughts about committing suicide. The individualmay be withdrawn and reluctant to discuss what heor she is thinking. Acknowledge the person's painand feelings of hopelessness, and encourage the in-dividual to talk to someone else if he or she doesnot feel comfortable talking with you. Familiarize yourself with suicide interventionsources, such as mental health centers and suicidehotlines. Ensure that access to firearms or other means ofself-harm is restricted. Fleener (2013) offers the following suggestions: Acknowledge and accept their feelings and be anactive listener. Try to give them hope and remind them thatwhat they are feeling is temporary. Stay with them. Do not leave them alone. Go towhere they are, if necessary. Show love and encouragement. Hold them, hugthem, touch them. Allow them to cry and expressanger. Help them seek professional help. Remove any items from the home with which theperson may harm himself or herself. If there are children present, try to remove themfrom the home. Perhaps another friend or rela-tive can assist by taking them to their home. Thistype of situation can be extremely traumatic forchildren. DO NOT: judge suicidal people, show anger to-ward them, provoke guilt in them, discount theirfeelings, or tell them to \"snap out of it.\" This is avery real and serious situation to suicidal individ-uals. They are in real pain. They feel the situa-tion is hopeless and that there is no other way toresolve it aside from taking their own life.Intervention With Families and Friends of Suicide Victims Cvinar (2005) stated: Suicide has a profound effect on the family, friends, and associates of the victim that transcends the im-mediate loss. As those close to the victim sufferthrough bereavement, a variety of reactions andcoping mechanisms are engaged as each individualsorts through individual reactions to the difficultloss. Bereavement following suicide is complicatedby the complex psychological impact of the act onthose close to the victim. It is further complicatedby the societal perception that the act of suicide is afailure by the victim and the family to deal withsome emotional issue and ultimately society affixesblame for the loss on the survivors. This individualor societal stigma introduces a unique stress on thebereavement process that in some cases requiresclinical intervention. (p. 14) Suicide of a family member can induce a whole gamut of feelings in the survivors. Macnab (1993) identified the following symptoms, which may be evi-dent following the suicide of a loved one: A sense of guilt and responsibility Anger, resentment, and rage that can never find its\"object\" A heightened sense of emotionality, helplessness,failure, and despair A recurring self-searching: \"If only I had donesomething,\" \"If only I had not done something,\"\"If only . . .\" A sense of confusion and search for an explana-tion: \"Why did this happen?\" \"What does it mean?\"\"What could have stopped it?\" \"What will peoplethink?\" A sense of inner injury. The family feels wounded.They do not know how they will ever get over it andget on with life A severe strain is placed on relationships. A senseof impatience, irritability, and anger exists betweenfamily members A heightened vulnerability to illness and disease ex-ists with this added burden of emotional stress Strategies for assisting survivors of suicide victims include: Encourage the clients to talk about the suicide,each responding to the others' viewpoints and re-constructing of events. Share memories. Be aware of any blaming or scapegoating of spe-cific family members. Discuss how each person fitsinto the family situation, both before and after thesuicide. Listen to feelings of guilt and self-persecution.Gently move the individuals toward the reality ofthe situation.284 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch17_274-288 23/07/14 12:08 PM Page 284CHAPTER 17 The Suicidal Client 285 Encourage the family members to discuss individ- ual relationships with the lost loved one. Focus onboth positive and negative aspects of the relation-ships. Gradually, point out the irrationality of anyidealized concepts of the deceased person. Thefamily must be able to recognize both positive andnegative aspects about the person before grief canbe resolved. No two people grieve in the same way. It may ap-pear that some family members are \"getting over\"the grief faster than others. All family membersmust be made to understand that if this occurs, itis not because they \"care less,\" just that they \"grievedifferently.\" Variables that enter into this phenom-enon include individual past experiences, personalrelationship with the deceased person, and individ-ual temperament and coping abilities. Recognize how the suicide has caused disorganiza-tion in family coping. Reassess interpersonal rela-tionships in the context of the event. Discusscoping strategies that have been successful in timesof stress in the past, and work to reestablish thesewithin the family. Identify new adaptive copingstrategies that can be incorporated.Identify resources that provide support: religiousbeliefs and spiritual counselors, close friends andrelatives, support groups for survivors of suicide.One online connection that puts individuals incontact with survivors groups specific to each stateis the American Foundation for Suicide Preventionat http://www.afsp.org. A list of resources that pro-vide information and help for issues regarding sui-cide is presented in Box 17-2. Evaluation Evaluation of the suicidal client is an ongoing processaccomplished through continuous reassessment ofthe client, as well as determination of goal achieve-ment. Once the immediate crisis has been resolved,extended psychotherapy may be indicated. The long-term goals of individual or group psychotherapy forthe suicidal client would be for him or her to: Develop and maintain a more positive self-concept. Learn more effective ways to express feelings toothers. Achieve successful interpersonal relationships. Feel accepted by others and achieve a sense ofbelonging.

Summary and Key Points More than 90 percent of all persons who commit orattempt suicide have a diagnosed mental disorder. Suicide is the third leading cause of death amongyoung Americans ages 15 to 24 years, the fourth lead-ing cause of death for ages 25 to 44, and the eighthleading cause of death for individuals ages 45 to 64. Single people are at greater risk for suicide thanmarried people. Women attempt suicide more, but men succeedmore often. Suicide and age are positively correlated. Depressed men and women who consider them-selves affiliated with a religion are less likely to at-tempt suicide than their nonreligious counterparts. Individuals in the very highest and lowest socialclasses have higher suicide rates than those in themiddle classes. Whites are at highest risk for suicide, followed byNative Americans, African Americans, HispanicAmericans, and Asian Americans.Psychiatric disorders that predispose individuals tosuicide include mood disorders, substance use dis-orders, schizophrenia, personality disorders, andanxiety disorders. Predisposing factors include internalized anger,hopelessness, desperation and guilt, history of aggres-sion and violence, shame and humiliation, develop-mental stressors, sociological influences, genetics, andneurochemical factors. It is important for the nurse to determine the seri-ousness of the intent, the existence of a plan, andthe availability and lethality of the method. The suicidal person should not be left alone. Once the crisis intervention is complete, the indi-vidual may require long-term psychotherapy, dur-ing which he or she works to: Develop and maintain a more positive self-concept Learn more effective ways to express feelings Improve interpersonal relationships Achieve a sense of belonging and a measure ofhope for living286 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Additional info available at www.davisplus.com Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

Whatwould this entail?CORE CONCEPTS behavior therapy stimulus 289184092_Ch18_289-297 23/07/14 12:10 PM Page 289290 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care A behavior is considered to be maladaptive when it is age inappropriate, when it interferes with adaptivefunctioning, or when others misunderstand it interms of cultural inappropriateness. The behavioralapproach to therapy is that people have become whatthey are through learning processes or, more cor-rectly, through the interaction of the environmentwith their genetic endowment. The basic assumptionis that problematic behaviors occur when there hasbeen inadequate learning and therefore can be cor-rected through the provision of appropriate learningexperiences. The principles of behavior therapy as weknow it today are based on the early studies of classi- cal conditioning by Pavlov (1927) and operant condi- tioning by Skinner (1938). Although in this text the concepts are presented separately for reasons of clar-ification, behavioral change procedures are oftencombined with cognitive procedures, and many be-havior therapies are referred to as cognitive-behavioraltherapies. Concepts of cognitive therapy are pre-sented in Chapter 19. Classical Conditioning Classical conditioning is a process of learning that wasintroduced by the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. Inhis experiments with dogs, during which he hoped tolearn more about the digestive process, he inadver-tently discovered that organisms can learn to respondin specific ways if they are conditioned to do so. In his trials he found that, as expected, the dogs salivated when they began to eat the food that was of-fered to them. This was a reflexive response thatPavlov called an unconditioned response . However, he also noticed that with time, the dogs began to sali-vate when the food came into their range of view, be-fore it was even presented to them for consumption.Pavlov, concluding that this response was not reflexivebut had been learned, called it a conditioned re- sponse . He carried the experiments even further by introducing an unrelated stimulus, one that had hadno previous connection to the animal's food. He simultaneously presented the food with the sound ofa bell. The animal responded with the expected re-flexive salivation to the food. After a number of trialswith the combined stimuli (food and bell), Pavlovfound that the reflexive salivation began to occurwhen the dog was presented with the sound of thebell in the absence of food.This was an important discovery in terms of how learning can occur. Pavlov found that unconditionedresponses (salivation) occur in response to uncondi-tioned stimuli (eating food). He also found that, overtime, an unrelated stimulus (sound of the bell) intro-duced with the unconditioned stimulus can elicit the same response alone\u2014that is, the conditioned re-sponse. The unrelated stimulus is called the condi- tioned stimulus. A graphic of Pavlov's classicalconditioning model is presented in Figure 18-1. Anexample of the application of Pavlov's classical condi-tioning model to humans is shown in Figure 18-2. Theprocess by which the fear response is elicited fromsimilar stimuli (all individuals in white uniforms) iscalled stimulus generalization .

FIGURE 18-2 Example: Classical conditioning and classic conditioning.4092_Ch18_289-297 23/07/14 12:10 PM Page 290Operant Conditioning The focus of operant conditioning differs from that of classical conditioning. With classical conditioning,the focus is on behavioral responses that are elicitedby specific objects or events. With operant condition-ing, additional attention is given to the consequencesof the behavioral response. Operant conditioning was introduced by B. F. Skinner (1953), an American psychologist whosework was largely influenced by Edward Thorndike's(1911) law of effect\u2014that is, that the connection be-tween a stimulus and a response is strengthened orweakened by the consequences of the response. Anumber of terms must be defined in order to under-stand the concept of operant conditioning. As defined previously, stimuli are environmental events that interact with and influence an individual'sbehavior. Stimuli may precede or follow a behavior. Astimulus that follows a behavior (or response) iscalled a reinforcing stimulus or reinforcer. The func- tion is called reinforcement. When the reinforcing stim-ulus increases the probability that the behavior willrecur, it is called a positive reinforcer, and the functionis called positive reinforcement. Negative reinforce- ment is increasing the probability that a behavior will recur by removal of an undesirable reinforcing stim-ulus. A stimulus that follows a behavioral responseand decreases the probability that the behavior willrecur is called an aversive stimulus or punisher. Exam- ples of these reinforcing stimuli are presented inTable 18-1. Stimuli that precede a behavioral response and predict that a particular reinforcement will occur arecalled discriminative stimuli. Discriminative stimuli are under the control of the individual. The individ-ual is said to be able to discriminate between stimuli and to choose according to the type of reinforcement he or she has come to associate with a specific stimu-lus. The following is an example of the concept of dis-crimination: EXAMPLE Mrs. M. was admitted to the hospital from a nursing home 2 weeks ago. She has no family, and no one visits her. Sheis very lonely. Nurse A and Nurse B have taken care of Mrs. M. on a regular basis during her hospital stay. When sheis feeling particularly lonely, Mrs. M. calls Nurse A to herroom, for she has learned that Nurse A will stay and talk toher for a while, but Nurse B only takes care of her physicalneeds and leaves. She no longer seeks out Nurse B for emo-tional support and comfort. After several attempts, Mrs. M. is able to discriminate be- tween stimuli. She can predict with assurance that callingNurse A (and not Nurse B) will result in the reinforcementshe desires. Techniques for Modifying Client Behavior Shaping In shaping the behavior of another, reinforcements are given for increasingly closer approximations to the desired response. For example, in eliciting speechfrom an autistic child, the teacher may first rewardthe child for (a) watching the teacher's lips, then (b) for making any sound in imitation of the teacher,then (c) for forming sounds similar to the word ut-tered by the teacher. Shaping has been shown to bean effective way of modifying behavior for tasks thata child has not mastered on command or are not inthe child's repertoire (Souders, DePaul, Freeman, &Levy, 2002). Modeling Modeling refers to the learning of new behaviors by imitating the behavior in others. Role models are individuals who have qualities or skills that a person admires and wishes to imitate(Howard, 2000). Modeling occurs in various ways.Children imitate the behavior patterns of their par-ents, teachers, friends, and others. Adults and childrenCHAPTER 18 Behavior Therapy 291 TABLE 18-1 Examples of Reinforcing Stimuli TYPE STIMULUS BEHAVIORAL RESPONSE REINFORCING STIMULUS Positive Negative AversiveChild gets allowance for cleaning room.Child does not receive scolding from the mother.

Unfortunately,modeling can result in maladaptive behaviors, as wellas adaptive ones. In the practice setting clients may imitate the be- haviors of practitioners who are charged with theircare. This can occur naturally in the therapeutic com-munity environment. It can also occur in a therapysession in which the client watches a model demon-strate appropriate behaviors in a role-play of theclient's problem. The client is then instructed to imi-tate the model's behaviors in a similar role-play andis positively reinforced for appropriate imitation. Premack Principle This technique, named for its originator, states thata frequently occurring response (R 1) can serve as a positive reinforcement for a response (R2) that oc- curs less frequently (Premack, 1959). This is accom-plished by allowing R 1to occur only after R2has been performed. For example, 13-year-old Jenniehas been neglecting her homework for the past fewweeks. She spends a lot of time on the telephonetalking to her friends. Applying the Premack prin- ciple , being allowed to talk on the telephone to her friends could serve as a positive reinforcement forcompleting her homework. A schematic of thePremack principle for this situation is presented inFigure 18-3. Extinction Extinction is the gradual decrease in frequency or dis- appearance of a response when the positive reinforce-ment is withheld. A classic example of this techniqueis its use with children who have temper tantrums.The tantrum behaviors continue as long as the parentgives attention to them but decrease and often disap-pear when the parent simply walks away from thechild and ignores the behavior. Contingency Contracting In contingency contracting, a contract is drawn up among all parties involved. The behavior change thatis desired is stated explicitly in writing. The contractspecifies the behavior change desired and the rein-forcers to be given for performing the desired behav-iors. The negative consequences or punishers that willbe rendered for not fulfilling the terms of the con-tract are also delineated. The contract is specificabout how reinforcers and punishment will be pre-sented; however, flexibility is important so that rene-gotiations can occur if necessary. Token Economy Token economy is a type of contingency contracting (although there may or may not be a written andsigned contract involved) in which the reinforcersfor desired behaviors are presented in the form oftokens. Essential to this type of technique is the priordetermination of items and situations of signifi-cance to the client that can be employed as rein-forcements. With this therapy, tokens are awardedwhen desired behaviors are performed and may beexchanged for designated privileges. For example,a client may be able to \"buy\" a snack or cigarettesfor 2 tokens, a trip to the coffee shop or library for5 tokens, or even a trip outside the hospital (if thatis a realistic possibility) for another designated num-ber of tokens. The tokens themselves provide imme-diate positive feedback, and clients should beallowed to make the decision of whether to spendthe token as soon as it is presented or to accumulatetokens that may be exchanged later for a more de-sirable reward. Time-Out Time-out is an aversive stimulus or punishment during which the client is removed from the environ-ment where the unacceptable behavior is being exhibited. The client is usually isolated so that rein-forcement from the attention of others is absent. Reciprocal Inhibition Also called counter-conditioning, reciprocal inhibi-tiondecreases or eliminates a behavior by introducing a more adaptive behavior, but one that is incompati-ble with the unacceptable behavior (Wolpe, 1958). An example is the introduction of relaxation exer-cises to an individual who is phobic. Relaxation ispracticed in the presence of anxiety so that in timethe individual is able to manage the anxiety in thepresence of the phobic stimulus by engaging in relax-ation exercises. Relaxation and anxiety are incompat-ible behaviors.292 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Discriminative stimulus (Homework assignment:to do or not to do)R 2 (Completion of home- work assignment)R1 (Talk to telephone) Premack 23/07/14 293 Overt Sensitization Overt sensitization is a type of aversion therapy that produces unpleasant consequences for undesirablebehavior. For example, disulfiram (Antabuse) is adrug that is given to individuals who wish to stopdrinking alcohol. If an individual consumes alcoholwhile on Antabuse therapy, symptoms of severe nauseaand vomiting, dyspnea, palpitations, and headachewill occur. Instead of the euphoric feeling normallyexperienced from the alcohol (the positive reinforce-ment for drinking), the individual receives a severepunishment that is intended to extinguish the unac-ceptable behavior (drinking alcohol). Covert Sensitization Covert sensitization relies on the individual's imagi- nation to produce unpleasant symptoms rather thanon medication. The technique is under the client'scontrol and can be used whenever and wherever itis required. The individual learns, through mentalimagery, to visualize nauseating scenes and even toinduce a mild feeling of nausea. This mental imageis visualized when the individual is about to succumbto an attractive but undesirable behavior. It is mosteffective when paired with relaxation exercises thatare performed instead of the undesirable behavior.The primary advantage of covert sensitization is thatthe individual does not have to perform the unde-sired behaviors but simply imagines them. Systematic Desensitization Systematic desensitization is a technique for assisting individuals to overcome their fear of a phobic stimu-lus. It is \"systematic\" in that there is a hierarchy of anx-iety-producing events through which the individualprogresses during therapy. An example of a hierarchyof events associated with a fear of elevators may be asfollows: 1.Discuss riding an elevator with the therapist. 2.Look at a picture of an elevator. 3.Walk into the lobby of a building and see the elevators. 4.Push the button for the elevator. 5.Walk into an elevator with a trusted person; disem-bark before the doors close. 6.Walk into an elevator with a trusted person; allowdoors to close; then open the doors and walk out. 7.Ride one floor with a trusted person, then walkback down the stairs. 8.Ride one floor with a trusted person and ride theelevator back down. 9.Ride the elevator alone.As each of these steps is attempted, it is paired with relaxation exercises as an antagonistic behaviorto anxiety. Generally , the desensitization procedures occur in the therapy setting by instructing the clientto engage in relaxation exercises. When relaxationhas been achieved, the client uses mental imageryto visualize the step in the hierarchy being de-scribed by the therapist. If the client becomes anx-ious, the therapist suggests relaxation exercisesagain, and presents a scene that is lower in the hi-erarchy. Therapy continues until the individual isable to progress through the entire hierarchy withmanageable anxiety. The effects of relaxation in thepresence of imagined anxiety-producing stimulitransfer to the real situation, once the client hasachieved relaxation capable of suppressing or in-hibiting anxiety responses (Ford-Martin, 2005).However, some clients are not successful in extin-guishing phobic reactions through imagery. Forthese clients, real-life desensitization may be required. In these instances, the therapist may arrange for theclient to be exposed to the hierarchy of steps in thedesensitization process, but in real-life situations.Relaxation exercises may or may not be a part ofreal-life desensitization. Flooding This technique, sometimes called implosive therapy , is also used to desensitize individuals to phobic stimuli.It differs from systematic desensitization in that, in-stead of working up a hierarchy of anxiety-producingstimuli, the individual is \"flooded\" with a continu-ous presentation (through mental imagery) of thephobic stimulus until it no longer elicits anxiety.Flooding is believed to produce results faster than systematic desensitization; however, some therapistsreport more lasting behavioral changes with system-atic desensitization. Some questions have also beenraised in terms of the psychological discomfort thatthis therapy produces for the client. Flooding is con-traindicated with clients for whom intense anxietywould be hazardous (e.g., individuals with heart dis-ease or fragile psychological adaptation) (Sadock &Sadock, 2007). Role of the Nurse in Behavior Therapy The nursing process is the vehicle for delivery ofnursing care with the client requiring assistancewith behavior modification. The steps of the nurs-ing process are illustrated in the following examplecase study.4092_Ch18_289-297 23/07/14 12:11 PM Page 293294 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care CASE STUDY (This example focuses on inpatient care, but these in- terventions can be modified and are applicable to vari- ous health-care settings, including partial hospitalization, community outpatient clinic, home health, and private practice.) ASSESSMENT Sammy, age 8, has been admitted to the child psychi- atric unit of a university medical center following evalu-ation by a child psychiatrist. His parents, Tom and Nancy,are at an impasse, and their marriage is suffering be-cause of constant conflict over their son's behavior athome and at school. Tom complains bitterly that Nancyis overly permissive with their son. Tom reports thatSammy argues and has temper tantrums and insists oncontinuing games, books, and TV, whenever Nancy putshim to bed, so that an 8:30 p.m. bedtime regularly isdelayed until 10:30 or later every night. Also, Nancyoften cooks four or five different meals for her son's din-ner if Sammy stubbornly insists that he will not eat whathas been prepared. At school, several teachers havecomplained that the child is stubborn and argumenta-tive, is often disruptive in the classroom, and refuses tofollow established rules. When asked by the psychiatric nurse about other mal- adaptive behaviors, such as destruction of property, steal-ing, lying, or setting fires, the parents denied that thesehad been a problem. During the interview, Sammy sat qui-etly without interrupting. He answered questions that weredirected to him with brief responses and made light of theproblems described by his parents and reported by histeachers. During his first 3 days on the unit, the following assess- ments were made: 1.Sammy loses his temper when he cannot have his way. He screams, stomps his feet, and sometimes kicks thefurniture. 2.Sammy refuses to follow directions given by staff. Hemerely responds, \"No, I won't. \" 3.Sammy likes to engage in behaviors that annoy the staffand other children: belching loudly , scraping his finger- nails across the blackboard, making loud noises whenthe other children are trying to watch television, openinghis mouth when it is full of food. 4.Sammy blames others when he makes a mistake. Hespilled his milk at lunchtime while racing to get to aspecific seat he knew T ony wanted. He blamed the accident on T ony saying, \"He made me do it! He tripped me!\" Upon completion of the initial assessments, the psy- chiatrist diagnosed Sammy with oppositional defiantdisorder.DIAGNOSIS/OUTCOME IDENTIFICATION Nursing diagnoses and outcome criteria for Sammy include: PLANNING/IMPLEMENTATION A contract for Sammy's care was drawn up by the admittingnurse and others on the treatment team. Sammy's contractwas based on a system of token economies. He discussedwith the nurse the kinds of privileges he would like to earn.They included: Getting to wear his own clothes (5 tokens) Having a can of pop for a snack (2 tokens) Getting to watch 30 minutes of TV (5 tokens) Getting to stay up later on Friday nights with the otherclients (7 tokens) Getting to play the video games (3 tokens) Getting to walk with the nurse to the gift shop to spendsome of his money (8 tokens) Getting to talk to his parents/grandparents on the phone(5 tokens) Getting to go on the outside therapeutic recreation activ-ities such as movies, the zoo, and picnics (10 tokens) Tokens were awarded for appropriate behaviors: Gets out of bed when the nurse calls him (1 token) Gets dressed for breakfast (1 token) Presents himself for allmeals in an appropriate manner, that is, no screaming, no belching, no opening his mouthwhen it is full of food, no throwing of food, staying in hischair during the meal, putting his tray away in the ap-propriate place when he is finished (2 tokens \u00d7 3 meals = 6 tokens) Completes hygiene activities (1 token) Accepts blame for own mistakes (1 token) Does not fight; uses no obscene language; does not\"sass\" staff (1 token) Remains quiet while others are watching TV (1 token) Participates and is not disruptive in unit meetings andgroup therapy sessions (2 tokens) Displays no temper tantrums (1 token) NURSING DIAGNOSES OUTCOME CRITERIA Noncompliance with therapy Defensive coping Impaired social interactionSammy participates in and cooperates during therapeutic activities. Sammy accepts responsibility for own behaviors and interacts with others withoutbecoming defensive. Sammy interacts with staff and peers using age-appropriate,acceptable behaviors.4092_Ch18_289-297 23/07/14 12:11 PM Page 294CHAPTER 18 Behavior Therapy 295 CASE STUDY\u2014cont'd Follows unit rules (1 token) Goes to bed at designated hour without opposition (1 token) Tokens are awarded at bedtime for absence of inappro- priate behaviors during the day. For example, if Sammy hasno temper tantrums during the day, he is awarded 1 token.Likewise, if Sammy has a temper tantrum (or exhibits otherinappropriate behavior), he must pay back the tokenamount designated for that behavior. No other attention isgiven to inappropriate behaviors other than withholdingand payback of tokens. EXCEPTION: If Sammy is receiving reinforcement from peers for inappropriate behaviors, staff has the optionof imposing time-out or isolation until the behavior isextinguished. The contract may be renegotiated at any time be- tween Sammy and staff. Additional privileges or respon- sibilities may be added as they develop and are deemedappropriate. All staff members are consistent with the terms of the contract and do not allow Sammy to manipulate. Thereare no exceptions without renegotiation of the contract. NOTE: Parents meet regularly with the case manager from the treatment team. Effective parenting techniquesare discussed, as are other problems identified withinthe marriage relationship. Parenting instruction coordi-nates with the pattern of behavior modification Sammyis receiving on the psychiatric unit. The importance of follow-through is emphasized, along with strong encour-agement that the parents maintain a united front in dis-ciplining Sammy. Oppositional behaviors are nurtured bydivided management. EVALUATION Reassessment is conducted to determine if the nursing actions have been successful in achieving the objectives ofSammy's care. Evaluation can be facilitated by gathering information using the following questions: Does Sammy participate in and cooperate during thera-peutic activities? Does he follow the rules of the unit (including mealtimes,hygiene, and bedtime) without opposition? Does Sammy accept responsibility for his own mistakes? Is he able to complete a task without becoming defensive? Does he refrain from interrupting when others are talkingor making noise in situations where quiet is in order? Does he attempt to manipulate the staff? Is he able to express anger appropriately without tantrumbehaviors? Does he demonstrate acceptable behavior in interactionswith peers? Summary and Key Points The basic assumption of behavior therapy is that problematic behaviors occur when there has beeninadequate learning and, therefore, can be cor-rected through the provision of appropriate learn-ing experiences. The antecedents of today's principles of behaviortherapy are largely the products of laboratory efforts by Pavlov and Skinner. Pavlov introduced a process that came to be knownas classical conditioning. Pavlov demonstrated in his trials with laboratoryanimals that a neutral stimulus could acquire theability to elicit a conditioned response throughpairing with an unconditioned stimulus. He con-sidered the conditioned response to be a new,learned response. Skinner, in his model of operant conditioning,gave additional attention to the consequences ofthe response as an approach to learning new be-haviors. Skinner believed that the connection between astimulus and a response is strengthened or weak-ened by the consequences of the response.Various techniques for modifying client behaviorinclude the following: Shaping: a technique in which reinforcementsare given for increasingly closer approximationsto the desired response. Modeling: refers to the learning of new behav-iors by imitating the behavior of others. Premack principle: this technique states that afrequently occurring response can serve as a pos-itive reinforcement for a response that occursless frequently. Extinction: the gradual decrease in frequency ordisappearance of a response when the positivereinforcement is withheld. Contingency contracting: a contract is drawn upspecifying a specific behavior change and the re-inforcers to be given for performing the desiredbehaviors. Token economy: a type of contingency contract-ing in which the reinforcers for desired behav-iors are presented in the form of tokens. Time-out: an aversive stimulus or punishmentduring which the client is removed from the en-vironment where the unacceptable behavior isbeing exhibited.4092_Ch18_289-297 23/07/14 12:11 PM Page 295Reciprocal inhibition: a technique that decreases or eliminates a behavior by introducing a moreadaptive behavior, but one that is incompatiblewith the unacceptable behavior. Overt sensitization: a type of aversion therapythat produces unpleasant consequences for un-desirable behavior. Covert sensitization: relies on an individual's imag-ination to produce unpleasant consequences forundesirable behaviors. Systematic desensitization: a technique for over-coming phobias in which there is a hierarchy ofanxiety-producing events through which the in-dividual progresses.Flooding (also called implosion therapy): desen-sitizes individuals to phobic stimuli by \"flooding\"them with a continuous presentation (throughmental imagery) of the phobic stimulus until itno longer elicits anxiety. Nurses can implement behavior therapy tech-niques to help clients modify maladaptive behaviorpatterns. The nursing process is a systematic method of direct-ing care for clients who require this type of assistance.296 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

Wright, Thase, and Beck (2008) stated: The writing of Epictetus in the Enchiridion, \"Men aredisturbed not by things, but by the views which they take ofthem,\" captures the essence of the perspective that our ideas or thoughts are a controlling factor in ouremotional lives. (p. 1212)This concept provides a foundation on which the cognitive model is established. In cognitive therapy, the therapist's objective is to use a variety of methodsto create change in the client's thinking and beliefsystem in an effort to bring about lasting emotionaland behavioral change (Beck, 1995).194092_Ch19_298-309 23/07/14 12:12 PM Page 298CHAPTER 19 Cognitive Therapy 299 This chapter examines the historical development of the cognitive model, defines the goals of therapy, and describes various techniques of the cognitive ap-proach. A discussion of the role of the nurse in theimplementation of cognitive behavioral techniqueswith clients is presented. NOTE: Although in this text the concepts are pre- sented separately for reasons of clarification, cogni- tive therapy procedures are often combined withbehavioral modification techniques and may be re-ferred to as cognitive-behavioral therapy. Historical Background Cognitive therapy has its roots in the early 1960s re- search on depression conducted by Aaron Beck(1963, 1964). Beck had been trained in the Freudianpsychoanalytic view of depression as \"anger turned in-ward.\" In his clinical research, he began to observe acommon theme of negative cognitive processing inthe thoughts and dreams of his depressed clients(Beck & Weishaar, 2011). A number of theorists have both taken from and expanded upon Beck's original concept. The com-mon theme is the rejection of the passive listeningof the psychoanalytic method in favor of active, di-rect dialogues with clients (Beck & Weishaar, 2011).The work of contemporary behavioral therapists has also influenced the evolution of cognitive ther-apy. Behavioral techniques such as expectancy of reinforcement and modeling are used within thecognitive domain. Lazarus and Folkman (1984), upon whose premise of personal appraisal and coping the conceptual format of this book is founded, have also contributed a greatdeal to the cognitive approach to therapy. The modelfor cognitive therapy is based on an individual's cog-nition, or more specifically, an individual's personalcognitive appraisal of an event and the resulting emo-tions or behaviors. Personality\u2014which undoubtedlyinfluences our cognitive appraisal of an event\u2014isviewed as having been shaped by the interaction be-tween innate predisposition and environment (Beck,Freeman, & Davis, 2007). Whereas some therapiesmay be directed toward improvement in copingstrategies or adaptiveness of behavioral response, cog-nitive therapy is aimed at modifying distorted cogni-tions about a situation.Indications for Cognitive Therapy Cognitive therapy was originally developed for usewith depression. Today it is used for a broad range ofemotional disorders. The proponents of cognitivetherapy suggest that the emphasis of therapy must bevaried and individualized for clients according totheir specific diagnosis, symptoms, and level of func-tioning. In addition to depression, cognitive therapymay be used with the following clinical conditions:panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, socialphobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumaticstress disorder, eating disorders, substance abuse, per-sonality disorders, schizophrenia, couples' problems,bipolar disorder, illness anxiety disorder, and somaticsymptom disorder (Beck, 1995; Sadock & Sadock,2007; Wright, Thase, & Beck, 2008). Goals and Principles of Cognitive Therapy Beck and associates (1987) defined the goals of cognitive therapy in the following way: The client will: 1.Monitor his or her negative, automatic thoughts. 2.Recognize the connections between cognition, affect, and behavior. 3.Examine the evidence for and against distorted automatic thoughts. 4.Substitute more realistic interpretations for thesebiased cognitions. 5.Learn to identify and alter the dysfunctional beliefs that predispose him or her to distort experiences. Cognitive therapy is highly structured and short- term, lasting from 12 to 16 weeks (Beck & W eishaar, 2011). Sadock & Sadock (2007) suggested that if a client does not improve within 25 weeks of therapy,a reevaluation of the diagnosis should be made. Although therapy must be tailored to the individual,the following principles underlie cognitive therapyfor all clients (Beck, 1995). Principle 1. Cognitive therapy is based on an ever-evolving formulation of the client and his or her pr oblems in cogni- tive terms. The therapist identifies the event that precipitated the distorted cognition. Current thinkingCORE CONCEPT Cognitive Therapy Cognitive therapy is a type of psychotherapy based on the concept of pathological mental processing. Thefocus of treatment is on the modification of distortedcognitions and maladaptive behaviors. CORE CONCEPT Cognitive Relating to the mental processes of thinking and reasoning. 4092_Ch19_298-309 23/07/14 12:12 PM Page 299300 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care patterns that serve to maintain the problematic behaviors are reviewed. The therapist then hypothe-sizes about certain developmental events and endur-ing patterns of cognitive appraisal that may havepredisposed the client to specific emotional and behavioral responses. Principle 2. Cognitive therapy requires a sound therapeutic alliance. A trusting relationship between therapistand client must exist for cognitive therapy to succeed.The therapist must convey warmth, empathy, caring, and genuine positive regard. Development of a work-ing relationship between therapist and client is an in-dividual process, and clients with various disorderswill require var ying degrees of effort to achieve this therapeutic alliance. Principle 3. Cognitive therapy emphasizes collaboration and active participation. T eamwork between therapist and client is emphasized. They decide together whatto work on during each session, how often theyshould meet, and what homework assignmentsshould be completed between sessions. Principle 4. Cognitive therapy is goal oriented and prob- lem focused. At the beginning of therapy, the client isencouraged to identify what he or she perceives to bethe problem or problems. With guidance from thetherapist, goals are established as outcomes of ther- apy . Assistance in problem solving is provided as re- quired as the client comes to recognize and correctdistortions in thinking. Principle 5. Cognitive therapy initially emphasizes the present. Resolution of distressing situations that are based in the present usually lead to symptom reduc-tion. It is therefore of more benefit to begin with current problems and delay shifting attention to thepast until (1) the client expresses a desire to do so,(2) the work on current problems produces little orno change, or (3) the therapist decides it is importantto determine how dysfunctional ideas affecting theclient' s current thinking originated. Principle 6. Cognitive therapy is educative, aims to teachthe client to be his or her own therapist, and emphasizesrelapse pr evention. From the beginning of therapy, the client is taught about the nature and course of his orher disorder, about the cognitive model (i.e., how thoughts influence emotions and behavior), andabout the process of cognitive therapy . The client is taught how to set goals, plan behavioral change, andintervene on his or her own behalf. Principle 7. Cognitive therapy aims to be time limited. Clients often are seen weekly for a couple of months,followed by a number of biweekly sessions, then pos-sibly a few monthly sessions. Some clients will want periodic \"booster\" sessions ever y few months.Principle 8. Cognitive therapy sessions are structured.Each session has a set structure which includes (1) reviewing the client's week, (2) collaborativelysetting the agenda for this session, (3) reviewing theprevious week' s session, (4) reviewing the previous week's homework, (5) discussing this week's agendaitems, (6) establishing homework for next week, and (7) summarizing this week's session. This formatfocuses attention on what is important and maxi-mizes the use of therapy time. Principle 9. Cognitive therapy teaches clients to identify, evaluate, and respond to their dysfunctional thoughtsand beliefs. Through gentle questioning and review of data, the therapist helps the client identify his or her dysfunctional thinking, evaluate the validityof the thoughts, and devise a plan of action. This isdone by helping the client to examine evidencethat supports or contradicts the accuracy of thethought, rather than directly challenging or con-fronting the belief. Principle 10. Cognitive therapy uses a variety of tech- niques to change thinking, mood, and behavior. T ech- niques from various therapies may be used within the cognitive framework. Emphasis in treatment is guided by the client's particular disorder and directed toward modification of the client's dysfunc-tional cognitions that are contributing to the mal-adaptive behavior associated with their disorder.Examples of disorders and the dysfunctional think-ing for which cognitive therapy may be of benefit arediscussed later in this chapter. Basic Concepts Wright and associates (2008) stated, \"The generalthrust of cognitive therapy is that emotional responsesare largely dependent upon cognitive appraisals ofthe significance of environmental cues\" (p. 1213).Basic concepts include automatic thoughts and schemas or core beliefs. Automatic Thoughts Automatic thoughts are those that occur rapidly in re-sponse to a situation and without rational analysis.These thoughts are often negative and based on er-roneous logic. Beck and associates (1987) called thesethoughts cognitive errors. Following are some examples of common cognitive errors: Arbitrary Inference In a type of thinking error known as arbitrary infer ence, the individual automatically comes to a conclusion about an incident without thefacts to support it, or even sometimes despite contra-dictory evidence to support it.4092_Ch19_298-309 23/07/14 12:12 PM Page 300CHAPTER 19 Cognitive Therapy 301 EXAMPLE Two months ago, Mrs. B. sent a wedding gift to the daugh- ter of an old friend. She has not yet received acknowledg-ment of the gift. Mrs. B. thinks, \"They obviously think I havepoor taste.\" Overgeneralization (Absolutistic Thinking) Sweeping con- clusions are overgeneralizations made based on one incident\u2014a type of \"all or nothing\" kind of thinking. EXAM PLE Frank submitted an article to a nursing journal and it was rejected. Frank thinks, \"No journal will ever be interested inanything I write.\" Dichotomous Thinking An individual who is using di- chotomous thinking views situations in terms of all-or -nothing, black-or-white, or good-or-bad. EXAMPLE Frank submits an article to a nursing journal and the editorreturns it and asks Frank to rewrite parts of it. Frank thinks,\"I'm a bad writer,\" instead of recognizing that revision is acommon part of the publication process. Selective Abstraction A selective abstraction (sometimes referred to as a \"mental filter\") is a conclusion that is based on only a selected portion of the evidence. Theselected portion is usually the negative evidence orwhat the individual views as a failure, rather than anysuccesses that have occurred. EXAMPLE Jackie just graduated from high school with a 3.98/4.00 grade point average. She won a scholarship to the large state universitynear her home. She was active in sports and activities in highschool and well liked by all her peers. However, she is very de-pressed and dwells on the fact that she did not earn a scholar-ship to a prestigious Ivy League college to which she had applied. Magnification Exaggerating the negative significance of an event is known as magnification. EXAMPLE Nancy hears that her colleague at work is having a cocktail party over the weekend and she is not invited. Nancy thinks,\"She doesn't like me.\" Minimization Undervaluing the positive significance of an event is called minimization . EXAMPLE Mrs. M. is feeling lonely. She telephones her granddaughter Amy, who lives in a nearby town, and invites her to visit. Amyapologizes that she must go out of town on business andwould not be able to visit at that time. While Amy is out oftown, she calls Mrs. M. twice, but Mrs. M. still feels unlovedby her granddaughter.Catastrophic Thinking Always thinking that the worst will occur without considering the possibility of more likelypositive outcomes is considered catastrophic thinking . EXAM PLE On Janet's first day in her secretarial job, her boss asked her to write a letter to another firm and put it on his desk for hissignature. She did so and left for lunch. When she returned,the letter was on her desk with a typographical error circledin red and a note from her boss to redo the letter. Janetthinks, \"This is it! I will surely be fired now!\" Personalization With personalization, the person takes complete responsibility for situations without consid- ering that other circumstances may have contributedto the outcome. EXAMPLE Jack, who sells vacuum cleaners door-to-door, has just given a 2-hour demonstration to Mrs. W. At the end of the demon-stration, Mrs. W tells Jack that she appreciates his demon-stration, but she won't be purchasing a vacuum cleaner fromhim. Jack thinks, \"I'm a lousy salesman\" (when in fact, Mrs.W's husband lost his job last week and they have no extramoney to buy a new vacuum cleaner at this time). Schemas (Core Beliefs) Beck and Weishaar (2011) defined cognitive schemas as: Structures that contain the individual's fundamental beliefs and assumptions. Schemas develop early in lifefrom personal experience and identification with sig-nificant others. These concepts are reinforced by fur-ther learning experiences and, in turn, influence theformation of beliefs, values, and attitudes. (p. 284) These schemas, or core beliefs, may be adaptive or maladaptive. They may be general or specific, and they may be latent, becoming evident only when trig-gered by a specific stressful stimulus. Schemas differfrom automatic thoughts in that they are deeper cog-nitive structures that serve to screen information fromthe environment. For this reason they are often moredifficult to modify than automatic thoughts. However,the same techniques are used at the schema level asat the level of automatic thoughts. Schemas can bepositive or negative, and generally fall into two broadcategories: those associated with helplessness and those associated with unlovability (Beck, 1995). Some exam- ples of types of schemas are presented in Table 19-1. Techniques of Cognitive Therapy The three major components of cognitive therapy aredidactic or educational aspects, cognitive techniques,and behavioral interventions (Sadock & Sadock,2007; Wright, Thase, & Beck, 2008).4092_Ch19_298-309 23/07/14 12:12 PM Page 301302 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Didactic (Educational) Aspects One of the basic principles of cognitive therapy is to prepare the client to eventually become his or herown cognitive therapist. The therapist provides infor-mation to the client about what cognitive therapy is,how it works, and the structure of the cognitiveprocess. Explanation about expectations of bothclient and therapist is provided. Reading assignmentsare given in order to reinforce learning. Some thera-pists use audiotape or videotape sessions to teachclients about cognitive therapy. A full explanationabout the relationship between depression (or anxi-ety, or whatever maladaptive response the client is ex-periencing) and distorted thinking patterns is anessential part of cognitive therapy. Cognitive Techniques Strategies used in cognitive therapy include recogniz-ing and modifying automatic thoughts (cognitive errors) and recognizing and modifying schemas (corebeliefs). Wright, Thase, and Beck (2008) identify thefollowing techniques commonly used in cognitivetherapy. Recognizing Automatic Thoughts and Schemas Socratic Questioning In Socratic questioning (also called guided discovery), the therapist questions the client about his or her situation. With Socratic questioning, the client isasked to describe feelings associated with specific situations. Questions are stated in a way that may stimulate in the client recognition of possible dysfunc-tional thinking and produce dissonance about the validity of the thoughts.Imagery and Role Play When Socratic questioning does not produce the de-sired results, the therapist may choose to guide theclient through imagery exercises or role-play in an effort to elicit automatic thoughts. Through guidedimagery, the client is asked to \"relive\" the stressful situation by imagining the setting in which it oc-curred. Where did it occur? Who was there? Whathappened just prior to the stressful situation? Whatfeelings did the client experience in association withthe situation? Role-play is not used as commonly as imagery. It is a technique that should be used only when the relation-ship between client and therapist is exceptionallystrong and there is little likelihood of maladaptivetransference occurring. With role-play, the therapistassumes the role of an individual within a situationthat produces a maladaptive response in the client.The situation is played out in an effort to elicit recog-nition of automatic thinking on the part of the client. Thought Recording This technique, one of the most frequently usedmethods of recognizing automatic thoughts, is taughtto and discussed with the client in the therapy session.Thought recording is assigned as homework for theclient outside of therapy. In thought recording, theclient is asked to keep a written record of situationsthat occur and the automatic thoughts that areelicited by the situation. This is called a \"two-column\"thought recording. Some therapists ask their clientsto keep a \"three-column\" recording, which includesa description of the emotional response also associ-ated with the situation, as illustrated in Table 19-2.TABLE 19-1 Examples of Schemas (or Core Beliefs) SCHEMA CATEGORY MALADAPTIVE/NEGATIVE ADAPTIVE/POSITIVE Helplessness Unloveability If I try and work very hard, I will succeed. I am not afraid of a challenge. If I make a mistake, I will try again. I'm a loveable person.People respect me for myself.No matter what I do, I will fail.I must be perfect. If I make one mistake, I will lose everything. I'm stupid. No one would love me.I'm nobody without a man. TABLE 19-2 Three-Column Thought Recording SITUATION AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS EMOTIONAL RESPONSE Girlfriend broke up with me. I was turned down for a promotion.Sadness; depression.AngerI'm a stupid person. No one would ever want to marry me. Stupid boss!! He doesn't know how to manage people. It's not fair!4092_Ch19_298-309 23/07/14 12:12 PM Page 302CHAPTER 19 Cognitive Therapy 303 Modifying Automatic Thoughts and Schemas Generating Alternatives To help the client see a broader range of possibilities than had originally been considered, the therapistguides the client in generating alternatives. Examining the Evidence With this technique, the client and therapist setforth the automatic thought as the hypothesis, andthey study the evidence both for and against the hypothesis. Decatastrophizing With the technique of decatastrophizing, the thera-pist assists the client to examine the validity of a neg-ative automatic thought. Even if some validity exists,the client is then encouraged to review ways to copeadaptively, moving beyond the current crisis situation. Reattribution It is believed that depressed clients attribute lifeevents in a negatively distorted manner; that is, theyhave a tendency \"to blame themselves for adverse life events and to believe that these negative situationswill last indefinitely\" (Wright, Thase, & Beck, 2008, p. 1216). Through Socratic questioning and testingof automatic thoughts, this technique is aimed at re-versing the negative attribution of depressed clientsfrom internal and enduring to the more external andtransient manner of nondepressed individuals. Daily Record of Dysfunctional Thoughts (DRDT) The DRDT is a tool commonly used in cognitive ther-apy to help clients identify and modify automaticthoughts. Two more columns are added to the three-column thought record presented earlier. Clients arethen asked to rate the intensity of the thoughts andemotions on a 0- to 100-percent scale. The fourth col-umn of the DRDT asks the client to describe a morerational cognition than the automatic thought iden-tified in the second column and rate the intensity ofthe belief in the rational thought. In the fifth column,the client records any changes that have occurred asa result of modifying the automatic thought and thenew rate of intensity associated with it. With this tool,the client is able to modify automatic thoughts byidentifying them and actually formulating a more ra-tional alternative. Table 19-3 presents an example ofa DRDT as an extension to the three-column thoughtrecording presented in Table 19-2. Cognitive Rehearsal This technique uses mental imagery to uncover potential automatic thoughts in advance of their occurrence in a stressful situation. A discussion is held to identify ways to modify these dysfunctionalcognitions. The client is then given \"homework\" as-signments to try these newly learned methods in realsituations. Behavioral Interventions It is believed that in cognitive therapy, an interactiverelationship exists between cognitions and behavior;that is, that cognitions affect behavior and behaviorinfluences cognitions. With this concept in mind, anumber of interventions are structured for the clientto assist him or her to identify and modify maladap-tive cognitions and behaviors. The following procedures, which are behavior- oriented, are directed toward helping clients learnmore adaptive behavioral strategies that will in turn TABLE 19-3 Daily Record of Dysfunctional Thoughts (DRDT) SITUATION Girlfriend broke up with me.

Activity Scheduling. With this intervention, clients are asked to keep a daily log of their activities on anhourly basis and rate each activity, for mastery and pleasure, on a zero-to-ten scale. The schedule is thenshared with the therapist and used to identify impor-tant areas needing concentration during therapy. 2. Graded Task Assignments. This intervention is used with clients who are facing a situation thatthey perceive as overw helming. The task is broken down into subtasks that clients can complete onestep at a time. Each subtask will have a goal and atime interval attached to it. Successful completionof each subtask helps to increase self-esteem anddecrease feelings of helplessness. 3. Behavioral Rehearsal. Somewhat akin to, and often used in conjunction with, cognitive rehearsal,this technique uses role-play to \"rehearse\" a mod-ification of maladaptive behaviors that may be contributing to dysfunctional cognitions. 4. Distraction. When dysfunctional cognitions have been recognized, distraction can occur by engag- ing in activities that redirect the client's thinking and divert him or her from the intrusive thoughtsor depressive ruminations that are contributing tothe maladaptive responses.5 . Miscellaneous Techniques. Relaxation exercises, assertiveness training, role modeling, and socialskills training are additional types of behavioral inter ventions that are used in cognitive therapy to assist clients to modify dysfunctional cogni-tions. Thought-stopping techniques (described in Chapter 14) may also be used to restructure dysfunctional thinking patterns. Role of the Nurse in Cognitive Therapy Many of the techniques used in cognitive therapy arewell within the scope of nursing practice, from generalistthrough specialist levels. Cognitive therapy requires anunderstanding of educational principles and the abilityto use problem-solving skills to guide clients' thinkingthrough a reframing process. The scope of contempo-rary psychiatric nursing practice is expanding, and although psychiatric nurses have been using some ofthese techniques in various degrees within their prac-tices for years, it is important that knowledge and skills related to this type of therapy be promoted further.The value of cognitive therapy as a useful and cost-effective tool has been observed in a number of inpa-tient and community outpatient mental health settings. The following case study presents the role of the nurse in cognitive therapy in the context of thenursing process. CASE STUDY ASSESSMENT Sam is a 45-year-old white male admitted to the psychi- atric unit of a general medical center by his family physi-cian, Dr. Jones, who reported that Sam had becomeincreasingly despondent over the last month. His wife reported that he had made statements such as, \"Life isnot worth living,\" and \"I think I could just take all thosepills Dr. Jones prescribed at one time, then it would all be over.\" He was admitted at 6:40 p.m., via wheelchairfrom admissions, accompanied by his wife. He reportsno known allergies. Vital signs upon admission were temperature, 97.9 \u00b0F; pulse, 80; respirations, 16; and blood pressure, 132/77. He is 5 feet 11 inches tall andweighs 160 pounds. He was referred to the psychiatriston call, Dr. Smith. Orders include suicide precautions,level I; regular diet; chemistry profile and routine urinal-ysis in Desyrel, 200 mg tid; Dalmane, 30 mg hs prnfor sleep. FAMILY DYNAMICS Sam says he loves his wife and children and does notwant to hurt them, but feels they no longer need him. Hestates, \"They would probably be better off without me.\"His wife appears to be very concerned about his condition,although in his despondency, he seems oblivious to herfeelings. His mother lives in a neighboring state, and he sees her infrequently. He admits that he is somewhat bittertoward her for allowing him and his siblings to \"suffer from the physical and emotional brutality of their father.\" Hissiblings and their families live in distant states, and he seesthem rarely, during holiday gatherings. He feels closest tothe older of the two brothers. MEDICAL/PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY Sam's father died 5 years ago at age 65 of a myocardial in-farction. Sam and both his brothers have a history of highcholesterol and triglycerides from approximately age 30.During his regular physical examination 1 month ago, Sam'sfamily doctor recognized symptoms of depression and prescribed fluoxetine. Sam's mother has a history of depres-sive episodes. She was hospitalized once about 7 years agofor depression, and she has taken various antidepressantmedications over the years. Her family physician has alsoprescribed Valium for her on numerous occasions for her\"nerves.\" No other family members have a history of psy-chiatric problems. 4092_Ch19_298-309 23/07/14 12:12 PM Page 304CHAPTER 19 Cognitive Therapy 305 CASE STUDY\u2014cont'd PAST EXPERIENCES Sam was the first child in a family of four. He is 2 years older than his sister and 4 years older than the third child,a brother. He was 6 years old when his youngest sibling,also a boy, was born. Sam's father was a career Army man,who moved his family many times during their childhoodyears. Sam attended 15 schools from the time he enteredkindergarten until he graduated from high school. Sam reports that his father was very autocratic and had many rules that he expected his children to obey withoutquestion. Infraction resulted in harsh discipline. BecauseSam was the oldest child, his father believed he should as-sume responsibility for the behavior of his siblings. Sam de-scribes the severe physical punishment he received fromhis father when he or his siblings allegedly violated one ofthe rules. It was particularly intense when Sam's father hadbeen drinking, which he did most evenings and weekends. Sam's mother was very passive. Sam believes she was afraid of his father, particularly when he was drinking, soshe quietly conformed to his lifestyle and offered no re-sistance, even though she did not agree with his disciplin-ing of the children. Sam reports that he observed his fatherphysically abusing his mother on a number of occasions,most often when he had been drinking. Sam states that he had very few friends when he was growing up. With all the family moves, he gave up tryingto make new friends because it became too painful to givethem up when it was time to leave. He took a paper routewhen he was 13 years old and then worked in fast-foodrestaurants from age 15 on. He was a hard worker andnever seemed to have difficulty finding work in any of theplaces where the family relocated. He states that he ap-preciated the independence and the opportunity of beingaway from home as much as his job would allow. \"I guessI can honestly say I hated my father, and working was myway of getting away from all the stress that was going onin that house. I guess my dad hated me, too, because henever was satisfied with anything I did. I never did wellenough for him in school, on the job, or even at home.When I think of my dad now, the memories I have are ofbeing criticized and beaten with a belt.\" On graduation from high school, Sam joined the Navy, where he learned a skill that he used after discharge toobtain a job in a large aircraft plant. He also attended the local university at night, where he earned his account-ing degree. When he completed his degree, he was reassigned to the administration department of the air-craft company, and he has been in the same position for12 years without a promotion. PRECIPITATING EVENT Over the last 12 years, Sam has watched while a numberof his peers were promoted to management positions.Sam has been considered for several of these positionsbut has never been selected. Last month a managementposition became available for which Sam felt he was qualified. He applied for this position, believing he had a good chance of being promoted. However, when theannouncement was made, the position had been given toa younger man who had been with the company only 5 years. Sam seemed to accept the decision, but over thelast few weeks he has become more and more withdrawn.He speaks to very few people at the office and is becomingmore and more behind in his work. At home, he eats verylittle, talks to family members only when they ask a directquestion, withdraws to his bedroom very early in theevening, and does not come out until it is time to leave for work the next morning. Today, he refused to get out ofbed or to go to work. His wife convinced him to talk to theirfamily doctor, who admitted him to the hospital. CLIENT'S PERCEPTION OF THE STRESSOR Sam states that all his life he has \"not been good enoughat anything. I could never please my father. Now I can'tseem to please my boss. What's the use of trying? I cameto the hospital because my wife and my doctor are afraid I might try to kill myself. I must admit the thought hascrossed my mind more than once. I seem to have very littlemotivation for living. I just don't care anymore.\" DIAGNOSES/OUTCOME IDENTIFICATION The following nursing diagnoses were formulated for Sam: 1.Risk for suicide related to depressed mood and expres- sions of having nothing to live for . 2.Chronic low self-esteem related to lack of positive feed-back and learned helplessness evidenced by a sense ofwort hlessness, lack of eye contact, social isolation, and negative/pessimistic outlook. The following may be used as criteria for measurement of outcomes in the planning of care for Sam: The client will: 1.Not harm self 2.Acquire a feeling of hope for the future 3.Demonstrate increased self-esteem and perception ofself as a wor t hwhile person PLANNING/IMPLEMENTATION Table 20-4 presents a nursing care plan for Sam employingsome techniques associated with cognitive therapy that are within the scope of nursing practice. Rationales are presented for each intervention. EVALUATION Reassessment is conducted to determine if the nursing in-terventions have been successful in achieving the objectivesof Sam's care. Evaluation can be facilitated by gathering information using the following questions: 1.Has self-harm subsided? 3.Does Sam know where to seek help in a crisis situation? 4.Has Sam discussed the recent loss with staff and family? 5.Is Sam able to verbalize personal hope for the future? 6.Can Sam identify positive attributes about himself? 7.Does Sam demonstrate motivation to move on with his life without a fear of failure? 4092_Ch19_298-309 23/07/14 12:12 PM Page 305306 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Table 19-4 | CARE PLAN FOR \"SAM\" (AN EXAMPLE OF INTERVENTION WITH COGNITIVE THERAPY) NURSING DIAGNOSIS: RISK FOR SUICIDE RELATED TO: Depressed mood OUTCOME CRITERIA NURSING INTERVENTIONS* RATIONALE* Sam will not harm himself.

Summary and Key Points Cognitive therapy is founded on the premise that how people think significantly influences their feelings and behavior. The concept was initiated in the 1960s by AaronBeck in his work with depressed clients. Since thattime, it has been expanded for use with a numberof emotional illnesses. Cognitive therapy is short-term, highly structured,and goal-oriented therapy that consists of threemajor components: didactic, or educational, aspects;cognitive techniques; and behavioral interventions. The therapist teaches the client about the relation-ship between his or her illness and the distortedthinking patterns. Explanation about cognitivetherapy and how it works is provided. The therapist helps the client to recognize his orher negative automatic thoughts (sometimes calledcognitive errors).Once these automatic thoughts have been identi-fied, various cognitive and behavioral techniquesare used to assist the client to modify the dysfunc-tional thinking patterns. Independent homework assignments are an impor-tant part of the cognitive therapist's strategy. Many of the cognitive therapy techniques arewithin the scope of nursing practice. As the role of the psychiatric nurse continues to expand, the knowledge and skills associated with a variety of therapies will need to be broadened.Cognitive therapy is likely to be one in whichnurses will become more involved.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has had very bad press. In the movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, it is depicted as a physically and emotionally brutal procedure imposed on unwilling clients in order tocalm them. Today, ECT remains one of the most con-troversial treatments for psychological disorders andcontinues to be the subject of impassioned debateamong various factions of society, within both the professional and lay communities.Despite its controversial image, ECT has been used continuously for more than 50 years, longer than anyother physical treatment available for mental illness. Ithas achieved this longevity because when administeredproperly, for the right illness, it can help as much as ormore than any other treatment (Kellner, 2010). This chapter explores the historical perspectives, indications and contraindications, mechanism of action, side effects, and risks associated with ECT. The204092_Ch20_310-318 24/07/14 5:27 PM Page 310CORE CONCEPT Electroconvulsive Therapy The induction of a grand mal (generalized) seizure through the application of electrical current to the brain. role of the nurse in the care of the client receiving ECT is presented in the context of the nursingprocess. Electroconvulsive Therapy, Defined The stimulus is applied through electrodes that areplaced either bilaterally in the frontotemporal regionor unilaterally on the same side as the dominanthand (Marangell, Silver, Goff, & Yudofsky, 2003).Controversy exists over optimal placement of theelectrodes in terms of possible greater efficacy withbilateral placement versus the potential in someclients for less confusion and acute amnesia with uni-lateral placement. The amount of electrical stimulus applied is another point of controversy among clinicians. Doseof stimulation is based on the client's seizurethreshold, which is highly variable among individu-als. The duration of the seizure should be at least 15 to 25 seconds (Karasu, Gelenberg, Merriam, &Wang, 2006). Movements are very minimal becauseof the administration of a muscle relaxant before thetreatment. The tonic phase of the seizure usuallylasts 10 to 15 seconds and may be identified by a rigid plantar extension of the feet. The clonicphase follows and is usually characterized by rhyth-mic movements of the muscles that decrease in fre-quency and finally disappear. Because of the musclerelaxant, movements may be observed merely as arhythmic twitching of the toes. Most clients require an average of 6 to 12 treat- ments, but some may require up to 20 treatments(Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Treatments are usually ad-ministered every other day, three times per week. Treat-ments are performed on an inpatient basis for thosewho require close observation and care (e.g., clientswho are suicidal, agitated, delusional, catatonic, oracutely manic). Those at less risk may have the optionof receiving therapy at an outpatient treatment facility. Historical Perspectives The first electroconvulsive therapy treatment was per-formed in April 1938 by Italian psychiatrists Ugo Cer-letti and Lucio Bini in Rome. Other somatic therapieshad been tried before that time, in particular insulin coma therapy and pharmacoconvulsive therapy.Insulin coma therapy was introduced by the German psychiatrist Manfred Sakel in 1933. His ther-apy was used for clients with schizophrenia. The insulininjection treatments would induce a hypoglycemiccoma, which Sakel claimed was effective in alleviatingschizophrenic symptoms. This therapy required vigor-ous medical and nursing intervention through thestages of induced coma. Some fatalities occurred whenclients failed to respond to efforts directed at termina-tion of the coma. The efficacy of insulin coma therapyhas been questioned, and its use has been discontin-ued in the treatment of mental illness. Pharmacoconvulsive therapy was introduced in Budapest in 1934 by Ladislas Meduna (Fink, 2009).He induced convulsions with intramuscular injectionsof camphor in oil in clients with schizophrenia. Hebased his treatment on clinical observation and on histheory that there was a biological antagonism be-tween schizophrenia and epilepsy. Thus, by inducingseizures he hoped to reduce schizophrenic symptoms.Because he discovered that camphor was unreliablefor inducing seizures, he began using pentylenete-trazol (Metrazol). Some successes were reported interms of reduction of psychotic symptoms, and, untilthe advent of ECT in 1938, pentylenetetrazol was the most frequently used procedure for producingseizures in psychotic clients. There was a brief resur-gence of pharmacoconvulsive therapy in the late1950s, when flurothyl (Indoklon), a potent inhalantconvulsant, was introduced as an alternative for indi-viduals who were unwilling to consent to ECT for thetreatment of depression and schizophrenia. Pharma-coconvulsive therapy is no longer used in psychiatry. Periodic recognition of the important contribution of ECT in the treatment of mental illness has been evident in the United States. An initial acceptance wasobserved from 1940 to 1960, followed by a 20-year period in which ECT was considered objectionable byboth the psychiatric profession and the lay public. A sec-ond wave of acceptance began around 1980 and hasbeen increasing to the present. The period of nonac-ceptability coincided with the introduction of tricyclicand monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressant drugsand ended with the realization among many psychia-trists that the widely heralded replacement of ECT withthese chemical agents had failed to materialize (Abrams,2002). Some individuals showed improvement with ECTafter failing to respond to other forms of therapy. Currently, an estimated 100,000 people in the United States and about 2 million people worldwidereceive ECT treatments each year (Mathew, Amiel, &Sackeim, 2013). The typical client is white, female,middle-aged, and from a middle- to upper-incomebackground, receiving treatment in a private or university hospital for major depression, usually afterCHAPTER 20 Electroconvulsive Therapy 3114092_Ch20_310-318 24/07/14 5:27 PM Page 311drug therapy has proved ineffective. Largely because of the expense involved, as well as the need for a teamof highly skilled medical specialists, many public hos-pitals are not able to offer this service to their clients. Indications Major Depression ECT has been shown to be effective in the treatmentof severe depression. It appears to be particularly effective in depressed clients who are also experienc-ing psychotic symptoms and those with psychomotorretardation and neurovegetative changes, such as dis-turbances in sleep, appetite, and energy. These symp-toms are associated with the diagnoses of majordepressive disorder, major depressive disorder withpsychotic or melancholic symptoms, and bipolar dis-order depression (Fink, 2009). ECT is not often usedas the treatment of choice for depressive disordersbut is considered only after a trial of therapy with antidepressant medication has proved ineffective. Mania ECT is also indicated in the treatment of acute manicepisodes of bipolar disorder (Black & Andreasen,2011). At present it is rarely used for this purpose,having been superceded by the widespread use of an-tipsychotic drugs and/or lithium. However, ECT hasbeen shown to be effective in the treatment of manicclients who do not tolerate or fail to respond tolithium or other drug treatment, or when life isthreatened by dangerous behavior or exhaustion. Schizophrenia ECT can induce a remission in some clients who present with acute schizophrenia, particularly if it isaccompanied by catatonic or affective (depression ormania) symptomatology (Black & Andreasen, 2011).It does not appear to be of value to individuals withchronic schizophrenic illness. Other Conditions ECT has also been tried with clients experiencing a variety of neuroses, obsessive-compulsive disorders, andpersonality disorders. Little evidence exists to supportthe efficacy of ECT in the treatment of these conditions. Contraindications The only absolute contraindication for ECT is in-creased intracranial pressure (from brain tumor, re-cent cardiovascular accident, or other cerebrovascularlesion). ECT is associated with a physiological rise in cerebrospinal fluid pressure during the treatment,resulting in increased intracranial pressure that could lead to brainstem herniation (Marangell et al.,2003). Various other conditions, not considered absolute contraindications but rendering clients at high riskfor the treatment, have been identified (Black & Andreasen, 2011; Eisendrath & Lichtmacher, 2013;Marangell et al., 2003). These conditions are largelycardiovascular in nature and include myocardial in-farction or cerebrovascular accident within the pre-ceding 3 to 6 months, aortic or cerebral aneurysm,severe underlying hypertension, and congestive heartfailure. Clients with cardiovascular problems areplaced at risk because of the response of the body tothe seizure itself. The initial vagal response results ina sinus bradycardia and drop in blood pressure. Thisis followed immediately by tachycardia and a hyper-tensive response. These changes can be life threaten-ing to an individual with an already compromisedcardiovascular system. Other factors that place clientsat risk for ECT include severe osteoporosis, acute andchronic pulmonary disorders, and high-risk or com-plicated pregnancy. Mechanism of Action The exact mechanism by which ECT effects a thera-peutic response is unknown. Several theories exist,but the one to which the most credibility has beengiven is the biochemical theory. A number of re-searchers have demonstrated that electric stimulationresults in significant increases in the circulating levelsof several neurotransmitters (Wahlund & von Rosen,2003). These neurotransmitters include serotonin,norepinephrine, and dopamine, the same biogenicamines that are affected by antidepressant drugs. Additional evidence suggests that ECT may also resultin increases in glutamate and gamma-aminobutyricacid (Grover, Mattoo, & Gupta, 2005). One recent study revealed that the therapeutic re- sponse from ECT may be related to the modulation ofwhite matter microstructure in pathways connectingfrontal and limbic areas, which are altered in major de-pression (Lyden, et al., 2014). The results of studies re-lating to the mechanism underlying the effectiveness ofECT are still ongoing and continue to be controversial. Side Effects The most common side effects of ECT are temporarymemory loss and confusion. Critics of the therapyargue that these changes represent irreversible braindamage. Proponents insist they are temporary and reversible. Black and Andreasen (2011) state: Because ECT disrupts new memories that have not been incorporated into long-term memory stores,312 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch20_310-318 24/07/14 5:27 PM Page 312ECT can cause anterograde and retrograde amnesia that is most dense around the time of treatment. Theanterograde component usually clears quickly, but theretrograde amnesia can extend back to months beforetreatment. It is unclear if the memory loss is due tothe ECT or to ongoing depressive symptoms. (p. 550) The controversy continues regarding the choice of unilateral versus bilateral ECT. Studies have shown that unilateral placement of the electrodesdecreases the amount of memory disturbance. How-ever, unilateral ECT often requires a higher stimulusdose or a greater number of treatments to match theefficacy of bilateral ECT in the relief of depression(Geddes, 2003). Risks Associated With Electroconvulsive Therapy Mortality Studies indicate that the mortality rate from ECT isabout 2 per 100,000 treatments (Marangell et al., 2003;Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Although the occurrence israre, the major cause of death with ECT is from car-diovascular complications (e.g., acute myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident), usually in in-dividuals with previously compromised cardiac status.Assessment and management of cardiovascular diseaseprior to treatment is vital in the reduction of morbidity and mortality rates associated with ECT. Permanent Memory Loss Most individuals report no problems with their mem-ory, aside from the time immediately surrounding theECT treatments. However, some clients have reportedretrograde amnesia extending back to months beforetreatment. In rare instances, more extensive amnesiahas occurred, resulting in memory gaps dating backyears (Joska & Stein, 2008). These clients report gapsin recollections of specific personal memories. Sackeim and associates (2007) reported on the re- sults of a longitudinal study of clinical and cognitiveoutcomes in patients with major depression treatedwith ECT at seven facilities in the New York City met-ropolitan area. Subjects were evaluated shortly follow-ing the ECT course and 6 months later. Data revealedthat cognitive deficits at the 6-month interval were di-rectly related to type of electrode placement and elec-trical waveform used. Bilateral electrode placementresulted in evaluatedat the 6-month follow-up) retrograde amnesia thanunilateral placement. the wasdirectly related to the number of ECT treatments re-ceived. The researchers also found that stimulationproduced by sine wave (continuous) current resultedin greater short- and long-term deficits than that pro-duced by short-pulse wave (intermittent) current. Black and Andreasen (2011) suggested that all clients receiving ECT should be informed of the pos-sibility for some degree of permanent memory loss.Although the potential for these effects appears to beminimal, the client must be made aware of the risksinvolved before consenting to treatment. Brain Damage Brain damage from ECT remains a concern for thosewho continue to believe in its usefulness and efficacyas a treatment for depression. Critics of the proce-dure remain adamant in their belief that ECT alwaysresults in some degree of immediate brain damage(Frank, 2002). However, evidence is based largely onanimal studies in which the subjects received exces-sive electrical dosages, and the seizures were unmod-ified by muscle paralysis and oxygenation (Abrams,2002). Although this is an area for continuing study,there is no evidence to substantiate that ECT pro-duces any permanent changes in brain structure orfunctioning (McClintock & Husain, 2011). The Role of the Nurse in Electroconvulsive Therapy Nurses play an integral role in the teaching andpreparation for and administration of ECT. They pro-vide support before, during, and after the treatmentto the client and family, and assist the medical profes-sionals who are conducting the therapy. The nursingprocess provides a systematic approach to the provi-sion of care for the client receiving ECT. Assessment A complete physical examination must be completedby the appropriate medical professional prior to theinitiation of ECT. This evaluation should include athorough assessment of cardiovascular and pul-monary status as well as laboratory blood and urinestudies. A skeletal history and x-ray assessment shouldalso be considered. The nurse may be responsible for ensuring that in- formed consent has been obtained from the client. Ifthe depression is severe and the client is clearly un-able to consent to the procedure, permission may beobtained from family or other legally responsible in-dividual. Consent is secured only after the client orresponsible individual acknowledges understandingof the procedure, including possible side effects andpotential risks involved. Client and family must alsounderstand that ECT is voluntary, and that consentmay be withdrawn at any time (American PsychiatricAssociation, 2001; Ying, PM Page 313Nurses may also be required to assess: The client's mood and level of interaction with others Evidence of suicidal ideation, plan, and means Level of anxiety and fears associated with receiv-ing ECT Thought and communication patterns Baseline memory for short- and long-term events Client and family knowledge of indications for, sideeffects of, and potential risks associated with ECT Current and past use of medications Baseline vital signs and history of allergies The client's ability to carry out activities of daily living Diagnosis/Outcome Identification Selection of appropriate nursing diagnoses for theclient undergoing ECT is based on continual assess-ment before, during, and after treatment. Selectedpotential nursing diagnoses with outcome criteria forevaluation are presented in Table 20-1. Planning/Implementation ECT treatments are usually performed in the morn-ing. The client is given nothing by mouth (NPO)for 6 to 8 hours before the treatment. Some institu-tional policies require that the client be placed on NPO status at midnight prior to the treatmentday. The treatment team routinely consists of the psychiatrist, anesthesiologist, and two or morenurses.Nursing interventions before the treatment include: Ensure that the physician has obtained informedconsent and that a signed permission form is onthe chart. Ensure that the most recent laboratory reports(complete blood count, urinalysis) and results ofelectrocardiogram (ECG) and x-ray examinationare available. Approximately 1 hour before treatment is sched-uled, take vital signs and record them. Have theclient void and remove dentures, eyeglasses or con-tact lenses, jewelry, and hairpins. Following institu-tional requirements, the client should change intohospital gown or, if permitted, into own loose cloth-ing or pajamas. At this point it is best for the clientto remain in bed. Side rails may be raised unlessprohibited by institutional policy or assessed as unsafe for the individual client. Approximately 30 minutes before treatment, ad-minister the pretreatment medication as pre-scribed by the physician. The usual order is foratropine sulfate or glycopyrrolate (Robinul) givenintramuscularly. Either of these medications maybe ordered to decrease secretions (to prevent aspiration) and counteract the effects of vagal stim-ulation (bradycardia) induced by the ECT. Stay with the client to help allay fears and anxiety.Maintain a positive attitude about the procedure,and encourage the client to verbalize feelings. In the treatment room the client is placed on the treatment table in a supine position, and the 314 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care TABLE 20-1 Potential Nursing Diagnoses and Outcome Criteria for Client Receiving ECT NURSING DIAGNOSES OUTCOME CRITERIA Anxiety (moderate to severe) related to impending therapy Deficient knowledge related to necessity for and side effects or risks of ECT Risk for injury related to risks associated with E CT Risk for aspiration related to altered level of consciousness immediately following treatment Decreased cardiac output related to vagal stimulation occurring during the ECT Impaired memory/acute confusion related to side effects of ECT Self-care deficit related to incapacitation during postictal stage Risk for activity intolerance related to post-ECT confusion and memory lossClient verbalizes a decrease in anxiety following explanation of procedure and expression of fears. Client verbalizes understanding of need for and side effects/risks of ECT following explanation. Client undergoes treatment without sustaining injury. Client experiences no aspiration during ECT. Client demonstrates adequate tissue perfusion during and after treatment (absence of cyanosis or severe change in mental status). Client maintains reality orientation following ECT treatment. Client's self-care needs are fulfilled at all times.Client gradually increases participation in therapeutic activities to the highest level of personal capability.4092_Ch20_310-318 24/07/14 5:27 PM Page 314anesthesiologist administers intravenously a short- acting anesthetic. The two most commonly used anes-thetic agents for ECT in the United States are metho-hexital and propofol (Kellner intravenously to prevent severe muscle contrac-tions during the seizure, thereby reducing the possibilityof fractured or dislocated bones. Because succinyl-choline paralyzes respiratory muscles as well, the clientis oxygenated with pure oxygen during and after thetreatment, except for the brief interval of electrical stim-ulation, until spontaneous respirations return (Kellner& Bryson, 2012). A blood pressure cuff may be placedon the lower leg and inflated above systolic pressureprior to the injection of the succinylcholine. This is toensure that the seizure activity can be observed in thisone limb that is unaffected by the muscle relaxant. An airway/bite block is placed in the client's mouth and he or she is positioned to facilitate airway patency.Electrodes are placed (either bilaterally or unilaterally)on the temples to deliver the electrical stimulation. Nursing interventions during the treatment include: Ensure patency of airway. Provide suctioning ifneeded. Assist anesthesiologist with oxygenation as required. Observe readouts on machines monitoring vitalsigns and cardiac functioning. Provide support to the client's arms and legs dur-ing the seizure. Observe and record the type and amount of move-ment induced by the seizure. After the treatment the anesthesiologist continues to oxygenate the client with pure oxygen until spon-taneous respirations return. Most clients awakenwithin 10 or 15 minutes of the treatment and are con-fused and disoriented; however, some clients willsleep for 1 to 2 hours following the treatment. Allclients require close observation in this immediatepost-treatment period. Nursing interventions in the post-treatment period include: Monitor pulse, respirations, and blood pressureevery 15 minutes for the first hour, during whichtime the client should remain in bed. Position the client on side to prevent aspiration. Orient the client to time and place. Describe what has occurred. Provide reassurance that confusion and memoryloss will subside, and memories should return fol-lowing the course of ECT therapy. Allow the client to verbalize fears and anxieties re-lated to receiving ECT. Stay with the client until he or she is fully awake,oriented, and able to perform self-care activitieswithout assistance.Provide the client with a highly structured sched-ule of routine activities in order to minimize confusion. Evaluation Evaluation of the effectiveness of nursing interven-tions is based on the achievement of the projectedoutcomes. Reassessment may be based on answers tothe following questions: Was the client's anxiety maintained at a manage-able level? Was the client/family teaching completed satisfactorily? Did the client/family verbalize understanding ofthe procedure, its side effects, and risks involved? Did the client undergo treatment without experi-encing injury or aspiration? Has the client maintained adequate tissue perfu-sion during and following treatment? Have vitalsigns remained stable? With consideration to the individual client's con-dition and response to treatment, is the client reoriented to time, place, and situation? Have all of the client's self-care needs been fulfilled? Is the client participating in therapeutic activitiesto his or her maximum potential? What is the client's level of social interaction? Careful documentation is an important part of the evaluation process. Some routine observationsmay be evaluated on flow sheets specifically identi-fied for ECT. However, progress notes with detaileddescriptions of client behavioral changes are essen-tial to evaluate improvement and help determinethe number of treatments that will be administered.Continual reassessment, planning, and evaluationwill ensure that the client receives adequate and appropriate nursing care throughout the course oftherapy. Summary and Key Points Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the inductionof a grand mal seizure through the application ofelectrical current to the brain. ECT is a safe and effective treatment alternative for individuals with depression, mania, or schizoaf-fective disorder who do not respond to other formsof therapy. ECT is contraindicated for individuals with in-creased intracranial pressure. Individuals with cardiovascular problems are athigh risk for complications from ECT. Other factors that place clients at risk include se-vere osteoporosis, acute and chronic pulmonarydisorders, and high-risk or complicated pregnancy.CHAPTER 20 Electroconvulsive Therapy 3154092_Ch20_310-318 24/07/14 5:27 PM Page 315The exact mechanism of action of ECT is unknown, but it is thought that the electrical stimulation re-sults in significant increases in the circulating levelsof the neurotransmitters serotonin, norepineph-rine, and dopamine. Modul matter microstructure in pathways connecting frontal andlimbic areas of the brain may also be involved. The most common side effects with ECT are tem-porary memory loss and confusion. Although it is rare, death must be considered a riskassociated with ECT. When it does occur, the mostcommon cause is cardiovascular complications. There may be a risk for some degree of permanentlong-term memory loss, and some opponents suggestthat a risk for brain damage also exists (althoughthere is little or no substantiating evidence). The nurse assists with ECT using the steps of thenursing process before, during, and after treatment. Important nursing interventions include ensuringclient safety, managing client anxiety, and provid-ing adequate client education. Nursing input into the ongoing evaluation of clientbehavior is an important factor in determining thetherapeutic effectiveness of ECT.316 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care Additional info available at www.davisplus.com Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

Optimistically, thecourse of the illness was viewed in terms of mainte-nance, and pessimistically, with the expectation fordeterioration. But research suggests that striving forand achieving recovery is in fact realistic for manyindividuals. The concept of recovery is not new. It originally began in the addictions field, referring to a personrecovering from a substance-related disorder. Theterm has recently been adopted by mental healthprofessionals who believe that recovery from mentalillness is also possible. CORE CONCEPT Recovery Restoration to a former and/or better state or condition. 4092_Ch21_319-330 23/07/14 12:17 PM Page 319320 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care What Is Recovery? A number of definitions of recovery as it applies to mental illness have been proposed. The SubstanceAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration(SAMHSA, 2011) suggests the following: Recovery from mental health disorders and sub- stance use disorders is a process of change throughwhich individuals improve their health and wellness,live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their fullpotential. SAMHSA suggests that a life in recovery is sup- ported by four major dimensions: 1. Health: overcoming or managing one's disease as well as living in a physically and emotionally healthy way. 2. Home: a stable and safe place to live. 3. Purpose: meaningful daily activities, such as a job, school, volunteerism, family caretaking, or creativeendeavors, and the independence, income, and re-sources to participate in society. 4 . Community: relationships and social networks that provide support, friendship, love, and hope . William A. Anthony (1993), executive director of the Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation at BostonUniversity, offers this definition: Recovery is described as a deeply personal, unique process of changing one's attitudes, values, feelings,goals, skills, and/or roles. It is a way of living a satis-fying, hopeful, and contributing life even with limi-tations caused by illness. Recovery involves thedevelopment of new meaning and purpose in one'slife as one grows beyond the catastrophic effects ofmental illness. (p. 13) The President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2003) proposes to transform the mental health system by shifting the paradigm of careof persons with serious mental illness from traditionalmedical psychiatric treatment toward the concept ofrecovery, and the American Psychiatric Associationhas endorsed a recovery model from a psychiatricservices perspective (Sharfstein, 2005). The basic concept of a recovery model is empow- erment of the consumer. The recovery model is de-signed to allow consumers primary control overdecisions about their own care. The National Associ-ation of Social Workers (NASW, 2006) suggests thatthis means, \"Consumers need to be as fully informedas possible about the potential benefits and conse-quences of each decision. They also need to know thepossible results if they become a danger to themselvesor others.\"Guiding Principles of Recovery As part of its Recovery Support Strategic Initiative, ayearlong effort by SAMHSA and a wide range of part-ners in the behavioral health-care community andother fields, a working definition of recovery frommental health and substance use disorders (previouslystated) was developed. In addition, a set of guidingprinciples that support the recovery definition were delineated. These guiding principles include the fol-lowing (SAMHSA, 2011, for use in the public domain): Recovery emerges from hope. The belief that re- covery is real provides the essential and motivatingmessage of a better future\u2014that people can anddo overcome the internal and external challenges,barriers, and obstacles that confront them. Hopeis internalized and can be fostered by peers, fami-lies, providers, allies, and others. Hope is the cata-lyst of the recovery process. Recovery is person-driven. Self-determination and self-direction are the foundations for recovery as in-dividuals define their own life goals and design theirunique path(s) toward those goals. Individuals opti-mize their autonomy and independence to the great-est extent possible by leading, controlling, andexercising choice over the services and supports thatassist their recovery and resilience. In so doing, theyare empowered and provided the resources to makeinformed decisions, initiate recovery, build on theirstrengths, and gain or regain control over their lives. Recovery occurs via many pathways. Individuals are unique with distinct needs, strengths, preferences,goals, culture, and backgrounds (including traumaexperiences) that affect and determine their path-way(s) to recovery. Recovery is built on the multiplecapacities, strengths, talents, coping abilities, re-sources, and inherent value of each individual. Recovery pathways are highly personalized. Theymay include professional clinical treatment; use ofmedications; support from families and in schools;faith-based approaches; peer support; and other ap-proaches. Recovery is nonlinear, characterized bycontinual growth and improved functioning thatmay involve setbacks. Because setbacks are a natural,though not inevitable, part of the recovery process,it is essential to foster resilience for all individuals andfamilies. Abstinence is the safest approach for thosewith substance use disorders. Use of tobacco andnonprescribed or illicit drugs is not safe for anyone.In some cases, recovery pathways can be enabled bycreating a supportive environment. This is especiallytrue for children, who may not have the legal or de-velopmental capacity to set their own course.4092_Ch21_319-330 23/07/14 12:17 PM Page 320Recovery is holistic. Recovery encompasses an in- dividual's whole life, including mind, body, spirit, and community. This includes addressing: self-carepractices, family, housing, employment, education,clinical treatment for mental disorders and sub-stance use disorders, services and supports, primaryhealth care, dental care, complementary and alter-native services, faith, spirituality, creativity, socialnetworks, transportation, and community partici-pation. The array of services and supports availableshould be integrated and coordinated. Recovery is supported by peers and allies. Mutual support and mutual aid groups, including the shar-ing of experiential knowledge and skills, as well associal learning, play an invaluable role in recovery.Peers encourage and engage other peers and pro-vide each other with a vital sense of belonging, sup-portive relationships, valued roles, and community.Through helping others and giving back to thecommunity, one helps one's self. Peer-operatedsupports and services provide important resourcesto assist people along their journeys of recoveryand wellness. Professionals can also play an impor-tant role in the recovery process by providing clin-ical treatment and other services that supportindividuals in their chosen recovery paths. Whilepeers and allies play an important role for many inrecovery, their role for children and youth may beslightly different. Peer supports for families are veryimportant for children with behavioral healthproblems and can also play a supportive role foryouth in recovery. Recovery is supported through relationship and so-cial networks. An important factor in the recovery process is the presence and involvement of peoplewho believe in the person's ability to recover; whooffer hope, support, and encouragement; and whoalso suggest strategies and resources for change.Family members, peers, providers, faith groups,community members, and other allies form vitalsupport networks. Through these relationships,people leave unhealthy and/or unfulfilling liferoles behind and engage in new roles (e.g., part-ner, caregiver, friend, student, employee) that leadto a greater sense of belonging, personhood, em-powerment, autonomy, social inclusion, and com-munity participation. Recovery is culturally-based and influenced. Cul-ture and cultural background in all of its diverserepresentations (including values, traditions, andbeliefs) are keys in determining a person's journeyand unique pathway to recovery. Services should beculturally grounded, attuned, sensitive, congruent,and competent, as well as personalized to meeteach individual's unique needs. Recovery is supported by addressing trauma. The experience of trauma (such as physical or sexualabuse, domestic violence, war, disaster, and others)is often a precursor to or associated with alcoholand drug use, mental health problems, and relatedissues. Services and supports should be trauma-informed to foster safety (physical and emotional)and trust, as well as promote choice, empowerment,and collaboration. Recovery involves individual, family, and commu-nity strengths and responsibility. Individuals, fami- lies, and communities have strengths and resourcesthat serve as a foundation for recovery. In addition,individuals have a personal responsibility for theirown self-care and journeys of recovery. Individualsshould be supported in speaking for themselves.Families and significant others have responsibilitiesto support their loved ones, especially for childrenand youth in recovery. Communities have respon-sibilities to provide opportunities and resources toaddress discrimination and to foster social inclu-sion and recovery. Individuals in recovery also havea social responsibility and should have the abilityto join with peers to speak collectively about theirstrengths, needs, wants, desires, and aspirations. Recovery is based on respect. Community, systems,and societal acceptance and appreciation for peo-ple affected by mental health and substance useproblems\u2014including protecting their rights andeliminating discrimination\u2014are crucial in achiev-ing recovery. There is a need to acknowledge thattaking steps toward recovery may require greatcourage. Self-acceptance, developing a positive andmeaningful sense of identity, and regaining beliefin one's self are particularly important. The recovery model integrates services provided by professionals (e.g., medication, therapy, case man-agement), services provided by consumers (e.g., ad-vocacy, peer support programs, hotlines, mentoring),and services provided in collaboration (e.g., recoveryeducation, crisis planning, community integration,consumer rights education) (Jacobson & Greenley,2001). Jacobson and Greenley state: Although many of these services may sound similar to services currently being offered in many mentalhealth systems, it is important to recognize that noservice is recovery-oriented unless it incorporates theattitude that recovery is possible and has the goal ofpromoting hope, healing, empowerment, and con-nection. (p. 485)CHAPTER 21 The Recovery Model 3214092_Ch21_319-330 23/07/14 12:17 PM Page 321Models of Recovery The Tidal Model The Tidal Model was developed in the late 1990s by Phil Barker and Poppy Buchanan-Barker of Newcastle, United Kingdom. It is a mental health nursing recoverymodel that may be used as the basis for interdiscipli-nary mental health care (Barker & Buchanan-Barker,2012). The authors use the power of metaphor to en-gage with the person in distress. The metaphor of water is used to describe how individuals in distress can be-come emotionally, physically, and spiritually shipwrecked (Barker & Buchanan-Barker, 2005). The Tidal Modelwas the first recovery model to be developed by nursesin practice, drawing largely on nursing research, andin collaboration with users and consumers of mentalhealth services (Barker & Buchanan-Barker, 2005;Brookes, 2006). The Tidal Model uses a person-centered approach to help people deal with their problems of human liv-ing. Focus is on the individual's personal story, whichis where his or her problems first appeared and whereany growth, benefit, or recovery will be found (Barker& Buchanan-Barker, 2000). Barker and Buchanan-Barker (2005) developed a set of essential values upon which the model is based.These values, which they call the 10 Tidal Commit-ments, \"provide practitioners with a philosophical focus for helping people make their own life changes,rather than trying to manage or control 'patientsymptoms'\" (Buchanan-Barker & Barker, 2008, p. 95).From these commitments, the authors developed TidalCompetencies, which reflect the way the commitmentsare practiced in the clinical setting. These commit-ments and competencies include the following: 1. Value the voice. The person is encouraged to tell his or her story . \"The person's story represents the beginning and endpoint of the helping en-counter, embracing not only an account of theperson's distress, but also the hope for its resolu-tion\" (Buchanan-Barker & Barker, 2008, p. 95). Practitioner competencies include a capacity toactively listen to the person's story and to help theperson record the story in his or her own words. 2. Respect the language. Individuals are encouraged to speak their own words in their own unique way. \"The language of the stor y\u2014complete with its un- usual grammar and personal metaphors\u2014is theideal medium for illuminating the way to recovery.We encourage people to speak their own words intheir distinctive (B uchanan-Barker tioner in- clude helping individuals express in their own lan-guage their understanding of personal experiencesthrough use of stories, anecdotes, and metaphors.3. Develop genuine curiosity. Nurses and other care- givers \"need to express genuine interest in thestory so that they can better understand the sto- ryteller and the story. Genuine curiosity reflectsan interest in the person and the person's uniqueexperience\" (Buchanan- Barker & Barker, 2008, p. 96). Practitioner competencies include show-ing interest in the person's story, asking for clari-fication of certain points, and assisting the personto unfold the story at his or her own rate. 4. Become the apprentice. The individual is the expert on his or her life story , and he or she must be the leader in deciding what needs to be done. \"Profes-sionals may learn something of the power of thatstory, but only if they apply themselves diligently andrespectfully to the task by becoming apprentice-minded\" (B uchanan-Barker & Barker, 2008, p. 96). Practitioner competencies include developing a planof care for the individual, based on his or her ex-pressed needs or wishes, and helping the individualidentify specific problems and ways to address them. 5. Use the available toolkit. Concentration is given to the individual's strengths, which are the major tools in the recover y process. \"The story contains examples of 'what has worked' for the person inthe past or beliefs about 'what might work' forthis person in the future. These represent themain tools that need to be used to unlock orbuild the story of recovery\" (B uchanan-Barker & Barker, 2008, p. 96). Practitioner competencies include helping individuals identify what effortsmay be successful in relation to solving identifiedproblems and which persons in the individual'slife may be able to provide assistance. 6. Craft the step beyond. The individual and the practi- tioner decide together what needs to be done imme-diately. \"Any 'first step' is a crucial step, revealing the power of change and potentially pointing towards the ultimate goal of recovery\" (Buchanan-Barker &Barker, 2008, p. 96). Practitioner competencies in-clude helping the individual determine what kind ofchange would represent a step toward recovery andwhat he or she needs to do to take that \"first step\" inthe progress toward that goal. 7. Give the gift of time. Change happens when the individual and practitioner spend quality time ina therapeutic relationship. \"The challenge is usingtime for things that are important\" (Young, 2010, p. 573). Practitioner competencies include acknowl-edging (and helping the individual understand) theimportance of time dedicated to addressing theneeds of the individual and the planning and im-plementing of care. 8 . Reveal personal wisdom. People often do not realize their own personal wisdom, strengths, and322 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch21_319-330 23/07/14 12:17 PM Page 322abilities. \"A key task for the professional is to help the person reveal and come to value that wisdom,so that it might be used to sustain the personthroughout the voyage of recovery\" (Buchanan-Barker & Barker, 2008, p. 97). Practitioner com-petencies include helping individuals to identifypersonal strengths and weaknesses and to developself-confidence in their ability to help themselves. 9. Know that change is constant. Because change is a constant in everyone' s life, important decisions and choices must be made along the path to re-covery in order for growth to occur. Professionalcompetencies include helping the individual de-velop awareness of the changes that are occurringand how he or she has influenced these changes.\"The task of the professional helper is to developawareness of how change is happening and to sup-port the person in making decisions regarding thecourse of the recovery voyage\" (Buchanan-Barker& Barker, 2008, p. 97). 10. Be transparent. Transparency is important in the teambuilding process between the individual andthe professional helper. \"Professionals are in a privileged position and should model confidenceby being transparent at all times, helping the per - son understand exactly what is being done andwhy\" (Buchanan-Barker & Barker, 2008, p. 97).Professional competencies include ensuring thatthe individual is aware of the significance of allinterventions and that he or she receives copiesof all documents related to the plan of care. Young (2010) states: The Tidal Model is not a typical boxes-and-arrows di- agram to use and follow. Instead, it is way of thinking,a paradigm for giving person-centered care that isstrength-based, empowering, and relational. (p. 574) The Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) The Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) Model was developed in 1997 by a group of 30 individuals who were attending a mental health recovery skills seminarconducted by Mary Ellen Copeland in Vermont. Thisgroup (which included persons with psychiatric symp-toms, family members, and care providers) determinedthe need for a system to incorporate the skills andstrategies they were learning in the seminar into theireveryday lives. Copeland (2001) states: [WRAP] is a structured system for monitoring un- comfortable and distressing symptoms and, throughplanned responses, reducing, modifying or eliminatingthose symptoms. It also includes plans for responsesfrom others when a person's symptoms have made itimpossible to continue to make decisions, take care ofhim/herself and keep him/herself safe. (p. 129)Copeland suggests that all a person needs to begin the program is a system for storing information (e.g., a notebook, computer, or tape recorder), and possi-bly a friend, health-care provider, or other supporterto give assistance and feedback. The program is astep-wise process through which an individual is ableto monitor and manage distressing symptoms thatoccur in daily life. Individuals may be assisted in theprocess by others (e.g., health-care professionals, sig-nificant others, friends), \"but to be effective and em-powering, the person experiencing the symptomsmust develop the plan for himself/herself\" (p. 129).Steps of the WRAP process are described in the fol-lowing paragraphs. Step 1: Developing a Wellness Toolbox In this first step, the individual creates a list of tools,strategies, and skills that he or she has used in the past(or has heard of in the past that he or she would liketo try) to assist in relieving disturbing symptoms.Copeland (2001) offers a number of examples: Talking to a friend or health-care professional Peer counseling or exchange listening Relaxation and stress-reduction exercises Guided imagery Journaling Physical exercise Attending a support group Doing something special for someone else Listening to music Step 2: Daily Maintenance List This list is divided into three parts. In part 1, the in-dividual writes a description of how he or she feels(or would like to feel) when experiencing wellness(e.g., bright, cheerful, talkative, happy, optimistic, ca-pable). This information is used as a reference point.In part 2, using the wellness toolbox as a reference,the individual makes a list of things he or she needsto do every day to maintain wellness. This is an im-portant part of the plan and must be realistic so asnot to set up the individual for \"failure\" or create ad-ditional frustration. Example items for part 2 may include the following (Copeland, 2001): Eat three healthy meals and three healthy snacks. Drink at least six 8-ounce glasses of water. Avoid caffeine, sugar, junk foods, and alcohol. Exercise for at least 30 minutes. Have 20 minutes of relaxation or meditation time. Write in my journal for at least 15 minutes. Take medications and vitamin supplements. Spend at least 30 minutes enjoying a fun, affirming,and/or creative activity. In part 3 of this step, the individual keeps a list of things that need to be done. The individual reads thisCHAPTER 21 The Recovery Model 3234092_Ch21_319-330 23/07/14 12:17 PM Page 323list daily as a reminder, and items may be considered for accomplishment on any given day at the individ-ual's discretion. For part 3, Copeland (2001) suggestsitems such as the following: Spend time with counselor or case manager. Make an appointment with health-care professional. Spend time with friend or partner. Be in touch with my family. Spend time with children or pets. Buy groceries. Do the laundry. Write some letters. Remember someone's birthday or anniversary. Step 3: Triggers This step is divided into two parts. In part 1, the indi-vidual lists events or circumstances that, should theyoccur, would cause distress or discomfort. These trig-gers are situations to which the individual is susceptibleor that have triggered or increased symptoms in thepast. Copeland (2001) lists the following examples: The anniversary dates of losses or trauma Being overtired or exhausted Work stress Family friction A relationship ending Being judged, criticized, or teased Financial problems Physical illness Sexual harassment or inappropriate sexual behavior Substance abuse In part 2, the individual uses items from the well- ness toolbox to develop a plan for \"what to do\" if trig-gers interfere with wellness. Step 4: Early Warning Signs This step is divided into two parts. Part 1 involvesidentification of subtle signs that indicate a possibleworsening of the situation. Copeland (2001) states,\"Recognizing early warning signs and reviewing themregularly will help the person to become more awareof these early warning signs, allowing the person totake action before the signs worsen\" (p. 136). Sometypes of early warning signs include anxiety, forgetful-ness, lack of motivation, avoiding others or isolating,increased irritability, increase in smoking, using sub-stances, or feeling worthless and inadequate. In part 2,the individual develops a plan for responding to the early warning signs that result in relief or in pre-venting them from escalating. The plan may includeitems such as consulting a supporter or counselor, in-creasing focus on peer counseling, increasing timespent in relaxation exercises, or utilizing other inter-ventions from the wellness toolbox until warningsigns diminish.Step 5: Things Are Breaking Down or Getting Worse This step is divided into two parts. In part 1, the indi-vidual lists symptoms that are occurring that indicatethat the situation has worsened. In this stage, thesymptoms are producing great discomfort, but the in-dividual is still able to take some action on his or herown behalf. Immediate action is required to preventa crisis from developing. Symptoms at this stage differgreatly from person to person, and Copeland (2001)states, \"What may mean 'things are breaking down'to one person may mean 'crisis' to another\" (p. 137).She lists a number of examples of symptoms, whichmay include the following: Irrational responses to events and the actions ofothers Inability to sleep or sleeping all the time Headaches Not eating or overeating Social isolation Thoughts of self-harm Substance abuse or chain smoking Bizarre behaviors Seeing things that aren't there Paranoia In part 2, the individual makes a plan that he or she thinks will help when the symptoms have wors-ened to this degree. The plan must be very specificand direct, with clear instructions. Some examples in-clude the following (Copeland, 2001): Call my health care-professional; ask for and followdirections. Arrange for someone to stay with me around theclock until my symptoms subside. Take action so that I cannot hurt myself if my symp-toms get worse, such as give my medication, check-book, credit cards, and car keys to a previouslydesignated friend for safe keeping. Make sure I do everything on my daily check list. Have at least two peer counseling sessions daily. Increase use of items from wellness toolbox (e.g.,relaxation exercises, physical exercises, creativeactivities). Step 6: Crisis Planning This stage identifies symptoms indicating that individ-uals can no longer care for themselves, make independ-ent decisions, or keep themselves safe. This stage ismultifaceted and is meant for use by caregivers on be-half of the individual who developed the plan. It is com-posed of the following parts (Copeland, 2001): Part 1: Gathers information that describes what theperson is like when well. Part 2: Identifies the symptoms that indicate when oth-ers need to take responsibility for the person's care.324 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch21_319-330 23/07/14 12:17 PM Page 324Part 3: Provides names of supporters previously identified by the individual to speak on his or herbehalf. Part 4: Includes the name of health-care providersand phone numbers; medications currently using;allergies to medications; medications the individualwould prefer to take, if additional medication isnecessary; medications that the individual refusesto take. Part 5: Includes the individual's preferred treat-ments and treatments that he or she wishes to beavoided. Part 6: Identifies the individual's preferences intreatment facilities (e.g., home, community care,respite center). Part 7: Identifies acceptable facilities if previouspreferences cannot be executed. Facilities to beavoided are also indicated. Part 8: Includes an extensive description of whatthe individual expects from identified supporterswho are acting on his or her behalf during a crisissituation. Part 9: Consists of a list of indicators, developed bythe individual, that communicates to supporterswhen their services are no longer required. The in-dividual should update this plan periodically whenhe or she learns new information or changes his orher mind about certain situations. Assurance of theuse of the crisis plan may be increased if it is nota-rized and signed in the presence of two witnesses.To further increase its potential for use, the personmay appoint a durable power of attorney, althoughbecause of the variability of the legality of thesedocuments from state to state, there is no guaran-tee that the plan will be followed. Copeland states: WRAP is a systematic method for developing skills in self-management and empowerment. It provides ameans for individuals with a mental illness to workmore collaboratively with healthcare providers. It ishighly individualized and addresses the unique needsof the person and his/her situation. It is applicable tomost any long-term illness/disability or problem situa-tion. These benefits suggest that it can be used morewidely and should be introduced as an option for indi-viduals in need of a self-management system. (p. 149) The Psychological Recovery Model Andresen, Oades, and Caputi (2011) define psycho- logical recovery as \"the establishment of a fulfilling,meaningful life and a positive sense of identityfounded on hopefulness and self-determination. Psy-chological recovery is necessary whether mental illness is biologically based or the result of the exacerbation of emotional problems caused by stress\"(p. 40). The Psychological Recovery Model does not emphasize the absence of symptoms, but focuses onthe person's self-determination in the course of his orher recovery process. In examining a number of studies, Andresen and associates (2011) identified four components thatwere consistently evident in the recovery process: Hope: finding and maintaining hope that recoverycan occur Responsibility : taking responsibility for one's life and well-being Self and identity : renewing the sense of self and building a positive identity Meaning and purpose: finding purpose and mean-ing in life Andresen and associates (2011) conceptualized a five-stage model of recovery, which they define by in-tegrating into each stage the four components of therecovery process. An explanation of these stages ispresented in the following paragraphs. Stage 1: Moratorium This stage is identified by dark despair and confusion.\"It is called moratorium, because it seems 'life is onhold'\" (p. 47). Hope: In the moratorium stage, hopelessness pre- vails. Clients may even perceive feelings of hope-lessness from practitioners when treatment plansemphasize stabilization and maintenance, therebyconveying messages of no hope for recovery. Responsibility :In the moratorium stage, the indi- vidual feels out of control and powerless to change. Self and identity: In the moratorium stage, individ- uals feel \"as though they no longer know who theyare as a person\" (p. 59). An individual's sense ofidentity as a valuable and functional member of so-ciety can be lost with a diagnosis of mental illness. Meaning and purpose: The diagnosis of severe mental illness is a traumatic event that can chal-lenge an individual's fundamental beliefs, creatinga loss of meaning and purpose in life. Stage 2: Awareness In this stage, the individual comes to a realization thata possibility for recovery exists. Andresen and associ-ates state, \"It involves an awareness of a possible selfother than that of 'sick person': a self that is capableof recovery\" (p. 47). Hope: In the awareness stage, there is a dawn of hope that indeed \"life is not over.\" This feeling ofhope may emanate from significant others, profes-sionals, or family members. Individuals may also beinspired by others who have recovered. Hope mayalso be derived from strong inner determinationand from personal faith and spirituality.CHAPTER 21 The Recovery Model 3254092_Ch21_319-330 23/07/14 12:17 PM Page 325Responsibility: In this stage, the individual devel- ops an awareness of the need to take control of his or her life. Feelings of control and responsibilitylead to a sense of personal empowerment thatpaves the way for recovery. Self and identity: In the awareness stage, the indi- vidual comes to realize that he or she is a person in-dependent of the illness. \"The person realizes thatthere still exists an 'intact self' capable of taking ac-tion on one's own behalf\" (p. 72). Meaning and purpose: In the awareness stage, the individual strives for a personal comprehension ofthe illness, why it occurred, and what the implica-tions of the illness are for his or her future. \"Seek-ing a meaning of the illness can be explained bytheories of cognitive control, in which one tries tounderstand unexplainable negative events by find-ing a reason for them\" (p. 74). Stage 3: Preparation This stage begins with the individual's resolve to beginthe work of recovery. Hope: In the preparation stage, hope is manifested in the mobilization of personal and external re-sources to foster self-care and find pathways togoals. This includes identifying strengths and weak-nesses, gathering knowledge and information, andseeking out available support systems. Responsibility :Taking responsibility in the prepa- ration stage involves learning about the effects ofthe illness and how to recognize, monitor, andmanage symptoms. Taking charge of one's life alsoincludes the ability to be independent and takecare of basic needs. Self and identity: Andresen and associates state, \"During the preparation stage, the person takes stock of his or her skills and strengths in order to build on them to rediscover a positive sense of identity\" (p. 81). The person is willing to take risks and try newactivities to reestablish a sense of self. Lost aspects ofself are rediscovered, new aspects are identified, andboth are incorporated into a new self-identity. Meaning and purpose: The basis for a meaningful lifelies in solid core values. \"Living according to one's val-ued directions gives meaning to the work of recovery,and for this reason, some people hold on tenaciouslyto their goals\" (p. 83). Each individual must live bycertain tenets that make life personally valuable andenriching. Individuals living with a severe mental ill-ness may require a reordering of priorities and settingof new goals as part of their recovery. Stage 4: Rebuilding The hard work of recovery takes place in the rebuild-ing stage. The individual \"takes the necessary steps towork towards his or her goals in rebuilding a mean-ingful life\" (p. 87). Hope: In the rebuilding stage, the individual has hope for and looks forward to a more fulfilling life.Realistic goals are set, and the individual is encour-aged to pursue the recovery process at his or herown pace. With each success, hope is renewed. Responsibility :\"Through setting and working to- wards goals, the person begins to actively take con-trol of his or her life; not only management ofsymptoms, but also enlisting social support, im-provement of self-image, handling social pressures,and building social competence\" (p. 90). Assumingcontrol of treatment decisions and illness manage-ment is an essential part of the recovery process. Self and identity: The individual elaborates and en- hances his or her sense of identity by having suc-ceeded in previous stages in developing a positiveself-identity separate from the illness and a newsense of self-confidence by succeeding at new activ-ities. In the rebuilding stage, the work of examiningcore values and working toward value-congruentgoals reinforce a positive sense of identity and acommitment to recovery. Meaning and purpose: Having realistic goals and a positive sense of identity provides a sense of pur-pose in life. Individuals need a reason to start eachday. Andresen and associates state, \"Finding mean-ing [in life] is more than finding a valued occupa-tion, but rather is more akin to finding a way to live.This may include, but is not limited to, vocationalgoals. It includes examining one's spirituality orphilosophy of life. The journey is, in itself, a sourceof meaning for many\" (p. 99). Stage 5: Growth The outcome of the psychological recovery process isgrowth. Although it is called the final stage of the Psy- chological Recovery Model, it is important to remem-ber that this is a dynamic stage and that personalgrowth is a continuing life process. Hope: In the growth stage, the individual feels a sense of optimism and hope of a rewarding future.Skills that have been nurtured in the previousstages are applied with confidence, and the indi-vidual strives for higher levels of well-being. Responsibility :\"Achieving control requires sustained commitment in the face of set-backs\" (p. 106). Inthe growth phase, individuals exhibit confidence inmanaging their illnesses and are resilient when re-lapses occur. They are empowered by personal inputand decision-making regarding their treatment. Self and identity: The individual in the growth stage has developed a strong, positive sense of self and identity. Andresen and associates state, \"Many 326 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care4092_Ch21_319-330 23/07/14 12:17 PM Page 326consumers have reported feeling that they are a bet- ter person as a result of their struggle with the illness.[In one research study] participants reported devel-oping personal qualities, including strength andcourage; more confidence in the self; resourceful-ness and responsibility; a new philosophy of life; com-passion and empathy; a of self-worth; more carefree\" (pp. 108-109). Meaning and purpose: Individuals who have reached the growth stage often report a more profound senseof meaning. Some describe having achieved a senseof serenity and peace, and for others it takes the formof a spiritual awakening. Some individuals find re-ward in educating others about the experience ofmental illness and recovery. Andresen and associates (2011) state, Recovery from serious mental illness is more than staying out of the hospital or a return to some arbi-trary level of functioning. It is more than merely cop-ing with the illness. In [the growth] stage, the notionof wellbeing replaces that of wellness. While wellnessimplies the absence of illness, wellbeing refers to amore holistic psychological experience of fulfillinglife. Although we may not expect everyone (includingthose who do not have a mental illness) to reach thehighest levels of self-actualization, we can expect thatall people have the opportunity to develop a positivesense of self and identity and to live a meaningful lifefilled with purpose and hope for the future. (p. 113) Nursing Interventions That Assist With Recovery The President's New Freedom Commission on Men- tal Health (2003) proposes to transform the mentalhealth system by shifting the paradigm of care ofpersons with serious mental illness from traditionalmedical psychiatric treatment toward the concept ofrecovery. It is within the scope of nursing to assist in-dividuals in many aspects of the mental health recov-ery process. Caldwell, Sclafani, Swarbrick, and Piren(2010) state: Professional nurses must play an active role in client recovery because they are employed in all aspects ofservice delivery systems, and most times professionalnurses are responsible for the delivery and coordina-tion of care. The professional nurse must be centerstage in the development and implementation of anyaction plan involving client recovery. (p. 44) Nurses have historically held as a primary goal the promotion of wellness within a collaborative nurse- client relationship. Peplau (1991) described nursingas \"a human relationship between an individual whois sick, or in need of health services, and a nurse es-pecially educated to recognize and to respond to theneed for help\" (pp. 5-6). As previously noted, recov-ery models are inherently collaborative in that serv-ices are provided by professionals, by clients, andcooperatively by both. Examples of interventions andactivities in which nurses and clients may collaboratein the client's journey to recovery are outlined inTable 21-1. If the proposals from the President's New Free- dom Commission on Mental Health become reality,it would surely mean improvement in the promotionof mental health and the care of individuals withmental illness. Many nurse leaders see this period ofhealth-care reform as an opportunity for nurses toexpand their roles and assume key positions in edu-cation, prevention, assessment, and referral. Nursesare, and will continue to be, in key positions to assistCHAPTER 21 The Recovery Model 327 TABLE 21-1 Nurse-Client Collaboration in the Mental Health Recovery Process THE TIDAL MODEL THE WRAP MODEL PSYCHOLOGICAL RECOVERY MODEL Assessment Client is feeling hopeless and powerless Client seeks meaning of theillness Nurse helps by offering hope Client begins to develop anawareness of the need totake control of and responsi-bility for his or her lifeClient develops a wellnesstoolbox by creating a list oftools, strategies, and skillsthat have been helpful in thepast Client identifies strengths andweaknesses Nurse provides assistanceand feedbackClient tells his or her personal story Nurse actively listens andexpresses interest in thestory Nurse helps client recordstory in client's own language Client identifies specificproblems he or shewishes to address Nurse and client identifyclient's strengths andweaknesses Continued4092_Ch21_319-330 23/07/14 12:17 PM Page 327individuals with mental illness to remain as inde- pendent as possible, to manage their illness withinthe community setting, and to strive to minimize thenumber of hospitalizations required. A vision of re-covery from mental illness exists, and hope, trust,and self-determination should be incorporated intoall treatment models. Summary and Key Points Recovery is the restoration to a former and/or bet-ter state or condition. SAMHSA identifies four major dimensions thatsupport a life in recovery: health, home, purpose,and community.The President's New Freedom Commission onMental Health proposes to transform the mentalhealth system by shifting the paradigm of care ofpersons with serious mental illness from traditionalmedical psychiatric treatment toward the conceptof recovery. SAMHSA outlines 10 guiding principles that sup-port recovery: Recovery emerges from hope. Recovery is person-driven. Recovery occurs via many pathways. Recovery is holistic. Recovery is supported by peers and allies. Recovery is supported through relationship andsocial networks.328 UNIT 3 Therapeutic Approaches in Psychiatric Nursing Care TABLE 21-1 Nurse-Client Collaboration in the Mental Health Recovery Process\u2014cont'd THE TIDAL MODEL THE WRAP MODEL PSYCHOLOGICAL RECOVERY MODEL Interventions OutcomesClient resolves to begin work of recovery Client and nurse identifystrengths and weaknesses Nurse assists client to learnabout effects of the illnessand how to recognize, moni-tor, and manage symptoms Client identifies changes heor she wishes to occur andsets realistic goals to rebuilda meaningful life Client examines personalspirituality and philosophy oflife in search of a meaningand purpose\u2014one that giveshim or her a \"reason to starteach day\" Client develops a positiveself-identity separate fromthe illness Client maintains commitmentto recovery in the face of set-backs Client feels a sense of optimism and hope of a rewarding futureClient creates a daily maintenance list How he or she feels at best What must be done dailyto maintain wellness Reminder list of otherthings that need to be accomplished Client identifies \"triggers\" thatcause distress or discomfortand identifies what to do if triggers interfere with wellness Client identifies signs ofworsening of symptoms anddevelops a plan to preventescalation Client identifies when symp-toms have worsened andhelp is needed Client identifies when he orshe can no longer care forself and makes decisions (in writing) about treatmentissues (what type, who willprovide, who will representclient's interests) Nurse offers support, andprovides feedback and assistance when needed Client develops skills in self-management Client develops self-confidence and hope for abrighter futureNurse and client determine what hasworked in the past Client suggests new toolshe or she would like to try Client decides whatchanges he or she wouldlike to make and sets realistic goals Nurse and client decidewhat must be done asthe first step Nurse gives positivefeedback for client's efforts to make lifechanges and for successes achieved Nurse encourages clientto be as independent aspossible, but offers assis-tance when required Nurse gives the \"gift oftime\" Client acknowledges thatchange has occurred andis ongoing Client feels empoweredto manage own self-care Nurse is available forsupport4092_Ch21_319-330 23/07/14 12:17 PM Page 328CHAPTER 21 The Recovery Model 329 Recovery is culturally-based and influenced. Recovery is supported by addressing trauma. Recovery involves individual, family, and commu- nity strengths and responsibility. Recovery is based on respect. Many models of recovery exist. Three models werediscussed in this chapter: the Tidal Model, theWellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) Model,and the Psychological Recovery Model.Nurses work in key positions to assist individualswith mental illness in the recovery process. Inter-ventions based on the three previously men-tioned recovery models were included in thischapter.

Hallucinations and illusions are common. Delirium Clinical Findings and Course A delirium is characterized by a disturbance in atten- tion and awareness and a change in cognition that develop rapidly over a short period (APA, 2013).Symptoms of delirium include difficulty sustainingand shifting attention. The person is extremely dis-tractible and must be repeatedly reminded to focusattention. Disorganized thinking prevails and is re-flected by speech that is rambling, irrelevant, pres-sured, and incoherent, and that unpredictablyswitches from subject to subject. Reasoning abilityand goal-directed behavior are impaired. Disorien-tation to time and place is common, and impair-ment of recent memory is invariably evident.Misperceptions of the environment, including illu-sions and hallucinations, prevail. Disturbances in thesleep-wake cycle occur. The state of awareness may range from that of hypervigilance (heightened awareness to environ-mental stimuli) to stupor or semicoma. Sleep mayfluctuate between hypersomnolence (excessivesleepiness) and insomnia. Vivid dreams and night-mares are common. Psychomotor activity may fluctuate between agi- tated, purposeless movements (e.g., restlessness, hy-peractivity, striking out objects) and avegetative state resembling catatonic stupor. Variousforms of tremor are frequently present. Emotional instability may be manifested by fear, anxiety, depression, irritability, anger, euphoria, or ap-athy. These various emotions may be evidenced bycrying, calls for help, cursing, muttering, moaning,acts of self-destruction, fearful attempts to flee, or at-tacks on others who are falsely viewed as threatening.Autonomic manifestations, such as tachycardia, sweat-ing, flushed face, dilated pupils, and elevated bloodpressure, are common. The symptoms of delirium usually begin quite abruptly (e.g., following a head injury or seizure). Atother times, they may be preceded by several hoursor days of prodromal symptoms (e.g., restlessness, dif-ficulty thinking clearly, insomnia or hypersomno-lence, and nightmares). The slower onset is morecommon if the underlying cause is systemic illness ormetabolic imbalance. The duration of delirium is usually brief (e.g., 1 week; rarely more than 1 month) and, upon recovery from theunderlying determinant, symptoms usually diminishover a 3- to 7-day period, but in some instances may takeas long as 2 weeks (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). The age ofthe client and duration of the delirium influence rateof symptom resolution. Delirium may transition into amore permanent cognitive disorder (e.g., major neu-rocognitive disorder) and also is associated with a highmortality rate (Bourgeois, Seaman, & Servis, 2008). Predisposing Factors Delirium Delirium most commonly occurs in individuals withserious medical, surgical, or neurological conditions.Some examples of conditions that have been knownto precipitate delirium in some individuals al., Sadock, such as hypoxia, hypercarbia,or hypoglycemia Hepatic Head Seizures Migraine abscess Stroke Postoperative states Electrolyte imbalance Other Etiological Implications Substance Intoxication Delirium In this subtype, the symptoms of delirium are attrib-uted to intoxication unknown) substance(APA, 2013).

Major NCDconstitutes what was previously described as dementia in the DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000). In progressive neu- rodegenerative conditions, these two diagnoses mayserve to identify earlier and later stages of the samedisorder. Either diagnosis may be appropriate (de-pending on severity of symptoms) for certain otherneurocognitive disorders that are the result of a re-versible or temporary condition. Criteria for these dis-orders are presented in Box 22-1. Clinical Findings, Epidemiology, and Course NCD constitutes a large and growing public health problem. An estimated 5.4 million people in theUnited States currently have Alzheimer's disease(AD), the most common form of NCD, and the preva-lence (the number of people with the disease at anyone time) doubles for every 5-year age group beyondage 65 (National Institute on Aging [NIA], 2011).The Alzheimer's Association (2013a) reports that of those with AD, an estimated 4 percent are underage 65, 6 percent are age 65 to 74, 44 percent are age334 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation CORE CONCEPT Neurocognitive A term that is used to describe cognitive functions closely linked to particular areas of the brain that have to do withthinking, reasoning, memory, learning, and speaking. Neurocognitive Disorder Neurocognitive disorder (NCD) is classified in the DSM-5 (APA, 2013) as either mild or major, with the distinction primarily being one of severity of sympto-matology. Mild NCD has been known in some settings BOX 22-1 Comparison of Diagnostic Criteria MILD NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDER A.

It is pro- jected that by 2050, the number of individuals aged65 and older with AD will number between 11 millionand 16 million, if current population trends continueand no preventive treatments become available(Alzheimer's Association, 2013a). After heart diseaseand cancer, AD is the third most costly disease to so-ciety, accounting for $100 billion in yearly costs (NIA,2011). This proliferation is not the result of an \"epi-demic.\" It has occurred because more people nowsurvive into the high-risk period for neurocognitivedisorder, which is age 65 and beyond. NCDs can be classified as either primary or second- ary. Primary NCDs are those, such as AD, in which theNCD itself is the major sign of some organic brain dis-ease not directly related to any other organic illness.Secondary NCDs are caused by or related to anotherdisease or condition, such as human immunodefi-ciency virus (HIV) disease or a cerebral trauma. In NCD, impairment is evident in abstract think- ing, judgment, and impulse control. The conven-tional rules of social conduct are often disregarded.Behavior may be uninhibited and inappropriate. Per-sonal appearance and hygiene are often neglected. Language may or may not be affected. Some individ- uals may have difficulty naming objects, or the languagemay seem vague and imprecise. In severe forms ofNCD, the individual may not speak at all ( aphasia). The client may know his or her needs, but may not knowhow to communicate those needs to a caregiver. Personality change is common in NCD and may be manifested by either an alteration or accentuation ofpremorbid characteristics. For example, an individualwho was previously very socially active may becomeapathetic and socially isolated. A previously neat per-son may become markedly untidy in his or her ap-pearance. Conversely, an individual who may havehad difficulty trusting others prior to the illness mayexhibit extreme fear and paranoia as manifestationsof the disorder. The reversibility of NCD is dependent on the basic etiology of the disorder. Truly reversible NCD occurs inonly a small percentage of cases and might be more ap-propriately termed temporary. Reversible NCD can occur as a result of cerebral lesions, depression, side effects ofcertain medications, normal pressure hydrocephalus,vitamin or nutritional deficiencies (especially B 12or fo- late), central nervous system infections, and metabolicdisorders (Srikanth & Nagaraja, 2005). In most clients,NCD runs a progressive, irreversible course.

The ability to work or care for personalneeds independently will no longer be possible.These individuals can no longer be left alone becausethey do not comprehend their limitations and aretherefore at serious risk for accidents. Wanderingaway from the home or care setting often becomes aproblem. Several causes have been described for NCD (see later \"Predisposing Factors\" section), but AD accountsfor 50 to 60 percent of all cases (Black & Andreasen,2011). The progressive nature of symptoms associatedwith AD has been described according to stages(Alzheimer's Association, 2013a; NIA, 2013; Stanley,Blair, & Beare, 2005): Stage 1: No Apparent Symptoms In the first stage of Alzheimer's disease, there is noapparent decline in memory. Stage 2: Forgetfulness The individual begins to lose things or forget namesof people. Losses in short-term memory are common.The individual is aware of the intellectual decline andmay feel ashamed, becoming anxious and depressed,which in turn may worsen the symptom. Maintainingorganization with lists and a structured routine pro-vide some compensation. These symptoms often arenot observed by others. Stage 3: Mild Cognitive Decline In this stage, there is interference with work perform-ance, which becomes noticeable to coworkers. The in-dividual may get lost when driving his or her car.Concentration may be interrupted. There is difficultyrecalling names or words, which becomes noticeableto family and close associates. A decline occurs in theability to plan or organize. Stage 4: Mild-to-Moderate Cognitive Decline At this stage of AD, the individual may forget majorevents in personal history, such as his or her ownchild's birthday; experience declining ability to per-form tasks, such as shopping and managing personalfinances; or be unable to understand current newsevents. He or she may deny that a problem exists bycovering up memory loss with confabulation (creat- ing imaginary events to fill in memory gaps). Depres-sion and social withdrawal are common. Stage 5: Moderate Cognitive Decline At this stage, individuals lose the ability to performsome activities of daily living (ADLs) independently,such as hygiene, dressing, and grooming, and requiresome assistance to manage these on an ongoing basis.They may forget addresses, phone numbers, andnames of close relatives. They may become disori-ented about place and time, but they maintain knowl-edge about themselves. Frustration, withdrawal, andself-absorption are common. Stage 6: Moderate-to-Severe Cognitive Decline At this stage, the individual with AD may be unable torecall recent major life events or even the name of hisor her spouse. Disorientation to surroundings is com-mon, and the person may be unable to recall the day,season, or year. The person is unable to manage ADLswithout assistance. Urinary and fecal incontinence arecommon. Sleeping becomes a problem. Psychomotorsymptoms include wandering, obsessiveness, agitation,and aggression. Symptoms seem to worsen in the lateafternoon and evening\u2014a phenomenon termed sun-downing . Communication becomes more difficult, with increasing loss of language skills. Institutionalcare is usually required at this stage. Stage 7: Severe Cognitive Decline In the end stages of AD, the individual is unable torecognize family members. He or she most commonlyis bedfast and aphasic. Problems of immobility, suchas decubiti and contractures, may occur. Stanley and associates (2005) described the late stages of neurocognitive disorders in the followingmanner: During late-stage [NCD], the person becomes more chairbound or bedbound. Muscles are rigid, contrac-tures may develop, and primitive reflexes may bepresent. The person may have very active hands andrepetitive movements, grunting, or other vocaliza-tions. There is depressed immune system function,and this impairment coupled with immobility maylead to the development of pneumonia, urinary tractinfections, sepsis, and pressure ulcers. Appetite de-creases and dysphagia is present; aspiration is com-mon. Weight loss generally occurs. Speech andlanguage are severely impaired, with greatly de-creased verbal communication. The person may nolonger recognize any family members. Bowel andbladder incontinence are present and caregiversneed to complete most ADLs for the person. Thesleep-wake cycle is greatly altered, and the personspends a lot of time dozing and appears socially with-drawn and more unaware of the environment or sur-roundings. Death may be caused by infection, sepsis,or aspiration, although there are not many studies examining cause of death. (p. 358) Predisposing Factors Neurocognitive disorders are differentiated by their eti- ology, although they share a common symptom presen-tation. Categories include the following (APA, 2013): Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder336 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch22_331-364 23/07/14 12:20 PM Page 336Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury Neurocognitive Disorder With Lewy Bodies Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection Substance-Induced Neurocognitive Disorder Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Huntington'sDisease Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Prion Disease Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Another MedicalCondition Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Multiple Etiologies Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the syndromeof symptoms identified as mild or major NCD and in the seven stages described previously. The onset of symp-toms is slow and insidious, and the course of the disor-der is generally progressive and deteriorating. Memoryimpairment is an early and prominent feature. Refinement of diagnostic criteria now enables clinicians to use specific clinical features to identifythe disease with considerable accuracy. Examinationby computerized tomography (CT) scan or mag-netic resona nce imagery (MRI) reveals a degenera- tive pathology of the brain that includes atrophy,widened cortical sulci, and enlarged cerebral ventricles (Figures 22-1 and 22-2).

Thesechanges apparently occur as a part of the normalaging process. However, in clients with AD, they arefound in dramatically increased numbers and theirprofusion is concentrated in the hippocampus andcertain parts of the cerebral cortex. Etiology The exact cause of AD is unknown. Several hypothe-ses have been supported by varying amounts andquality of data. These hypotheses include: Acetylcholine Alterations. Research has indicated that in the brains of Alzheimer's clients, the enzyme required to produce acetylcholine is dramatically reduced. The reduction seems to begreatest in the nucleus basalis of the inferior me-dial forebrain area (Cummings & Mega, 2003).This decrease in production of acetylcholine reduces the amount of the neurotransmitter thatis released to cells in the cortex and hippocam-pus, resulting in a disruption of the cognitiveprocesses. Other neurotransmitters implicated in the pathology and clinical symptoms of AD include norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine,and the amino acid glutamate. It has been proposed that in NCD, excess glutamate leads to overstimulation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, leading to increased intracel-lular calcium, and subsequent neuronal degener-ation and cell death. Plaques and Tangles. As mentioned previously, an overabundance of structures called plaques and tan- glesappear in the brains of individuals with AD. The plaques are made of a protein called amyloidbeta (A ), which are fragments of a larger protein called amyloid precursor protein (APP) (NIA,2011). Plaques are formed when these fragmentsclump together and mix with molecules and othercellular matter. Tangles are formed from a specialkind of cellular protein called tau protein, whosefunction it is to provide stability to the neuron. InAD, the tau protein is chemically altered (NIA,2011). Strands of the protein become tangled to-gether, interfering with the neuronal transport sys-tem. It is not known whether the plaques andtangles cause AD or are a consequence of the ADprocess. It is thought that the plaques and tanglescontribute to the destruction and death of neu-rons, leading to memory failure, personalitychanges, inability to carry out ADLs, and other fea-tures of the disease. Head Trauma. Individuals who have a history of head trauma are at risk for AD (Black & Andreasen, 2011). Studies have shown that some in-dividuals who had experienced head trauma had4092_Ch22_331-364 23/07/14 12:20 PM Page 337338 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation NormalLanguageLanguage Memory MemoryVentricleGyrusSulcus GyrusSulcus Alzheimer'sBrain Cross Sections NEUROTRANSMITTERS A decrease in the neurotransmitter acetylcholine has been implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. Cholinergic sources arise from the brainstem and the basal forebrain to supply areas of ganglia, thalamus, limbic structures, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex. Cell bodies of origin for the serotonin pathways lie within the raphe nuclei located in the brainstem. Those for norepinepherin e originate in the locus ceruleus. Projections for extend cortex, cerebellum,and limbic system. Dopamine pathways arise from areas in the midbrain and project to the frontal cortex, limbic system, basal g anglia, and thalamus. the an excitatory neurotransmitter, has descending pathways with highest concentrations in the cerebral cortex. It is also found in the hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and spinal cord. AREAS OF THE BRAIN AFFECTED Areas of the brain affected by Alzheimer's disease and associated symptoms include the following:\u0081 Frontal lobe: Impaired reasoning ability; unable to solve problems and perform familiar tasks; poor judgment; inability to evaluate the appropriateness of behavior; aggressiveness. \u0081 Parietal lobe: Impaired orientation ability; impaired visuospatial (unable to remain oriented within own environment).\u0081 Occipital lobe: Impaired language interpretation; unable to recognize familiar objects.\u0081 Temporal lobe: Inability to recall words; inability to use words correctly (language comprehension). In late stages, some clie nts experience delusions, and hallucinations. \u0081 Hippocampus: Impaired memory. Short-term memory is affected initially. Later, the individual is unable to form new memories.\u0081 Amygdala: Impaired emotions: depression, anxiety, fear, personality changes, apathy, paranoia.\u0081 Neurotransmitters: Alterations in acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and others may play a role in behaviors such as restlessness, sleep impairment, mood, and agitation. MEDICATIONS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN 1. Cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) act by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, which slo ws the degradation of acetylcholine, thereby increasing concentrations of the neurotransmitter in the brain. Most common side effectsinclude dizziness, gastrointestinal upset, fatigue, and headache. 2. NMDA receptor antagonists (e.g., memantine) act by blocking NMDA receptors from excessive glutamate, preventing continuous influx of calcium into the cells, and ultimately slowing down neuronal degradation. Possible side effects include dizziness,headache, and constipation.FIGURE 22-2 Neurobiology of Alzheimer's disease. http://www.ahaf.org/alzdis/about/ BrainAlzheimer.htm, with permission.)4092_Ch22_331-364 23/07/14 12:20 PM Page 338CHAPTER 22 Neurocognitive Disorders 339 subsequently (after years) developed AD. This hy- pothesis is being investigated as a possible cause.Munoz and Feldman (2000) reported an increasedrisk for AD in individuals who are both geneticallypredisposed and who experience traumatic head injury. Genetic Factors. There is clearly a familial pat-tern with some forms of AD. Some families ex-hibit a pattern of inheritance that suggestspossible autosomal-dominant gene transmission(Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Some studies indicatethat early-onset cases are more likely to be famil-ial than late-onset cases, and that from one-thirdto one-half of all cases may be of the geneticform. Some research indicates that there is a linkbetween AD and gene mutations found on chro-mosomes 21, 14, and 1 (Alzheimer's Disease Education & Referral [ADEAR], 2012). Muta-tions on chromosome 21 cause the formation of abnormal APP. Mutations on chromosome 14 cause abnormal presenilin 1 ( PS-1) to be made, and mutations on chromosome 1 lead tothe formation of abnormal presenilin 2 (PS-2 ). Each of these mutations results in an increasedamount of the A protein that is a major compo- nent of the plaques associated with AD. Individu-als with Down syndrome (who carry an extra copyof chromosome 21) have been found to be un-usually susceptible to AD (Blazer, 2008). Two genetic variants have been identified as risk factors for late-onset AD. The apolipoprotein E ep-silon4 (ApoE 4) gene, found on chromosome 19, was identified in 1993. Its exact role in the develop-ment of AD is not yet clear (ADEAR, 2012). A secondgenetic variant, the SORL1 gene, was identified in2007 (Rogaeva et al., 2007). The researchers believethat the altered gene function results in increasingproduction of the toxic A /H9252protein and subsequently the plaques associated with AD. Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder In vascular NCD, the syndrome of cognitive symptomsis due to significant cerebrovascular disease. Theblood vessels of the brain are affected, and progres-sive intellectual deterioration occurs. Vascular NCDis the second most common form of NCD, rankingafter AD (Bourgeois et al., 2008). Vascular NCD differs from AD in that it has a more abrupt onset and runs a highly variable course. Steckl(2008) states: Memory loss often occurs later in [Vascular NCD] compared to when it emerges in people withAlzheimer's. Typically, people with AD notice mem-ory problems first. In contrast, people with Vascular[NCD] usually experience problems with reflexes,gait, and muscle weakness first.In vascular NCD, progression of the symptoms oc- curs in \"steps\" rather than as a gradual deterioration; that is, at times the symptoms seem to clear up andthe individual exhibits fairly lucid thinking. Memorymay seem better, and the client may become opti-mistic that improvement is occurring, only to experi-ence further decline of functioning in a fluctuatingpattern of progression. This irregular pattern of decline appears to be an intense source of anxiety forthe client with this disorder. In vascular NCD, clients suffer the equivalent of small strokes that destroy many areas of the brain.The pattern of deficits is variable, depending onwhich regions of the brain have been affected. Cer-tain focal neurological signs are commonly seen withvascular NCD, including weaknesses of the limbs,small-stepped gait, and difficulty with speech. The disorder is more common in men than in women. Arvanitakis (2000) states: Prognosis for patients with vascular [NCD] is worse than that for Alzheimer's patients. The three-yearmortality rate in cases over the age of 85 years old isquoted at 67 percent as compared to 42 percent inAlzheimer's disease, and 23 percent in individualswith no NCD. However, outcome is ultimately de-pendent on the underlying risk factors and mecha-nism of disease, and further studies taking these distinctions into account are warranted. Etiology The cause of vascular NCD is directly related to an interruption of blood flow to the brain. Symptomsresult from death of nerve cells in regions nour-ished by diseased vessels. Various diseases and con-ditions that interfere with blood circulation havebeen implicated. High blood pressure is thought to be one of the most significant factors in the etiology of multiplesmall strokes or cerebral infarcts. Hypertension leadsto damage to the lining of blood vessels. This can re-sult in rupture of the blood vessel with subsequenthemorrhage or an accumulation of fibrin in the vesselwith intravascular clotting and inhibited blood flow.NCD also can result from infarcts related to occlusionof blood vessels by particulate matter that travelsthrough the bloodstream to the brain. These embolimay be solid (e.g., clots, cellular debris, platelet ag-gregates), gaseous (e.g., air, nitrogen), or liquid (e.g.,fat, following soft tissue trauma or fracture of longbones). Cognitive impairment can occur with multiple small infarcts (sometimes called \"silent strokes\") overtime or with a single cerebrovascular insult that oc-curs in a strategic area of the brain. An individual mayhave both vascular NCD and AD simultaneously. Thisis referred to as a mixed disorder, the prevalence of4092_Ch22_331-364 23/07/14 12:20 PM Page 339which is likely to increase as the population ages (Langa, Foster, & Larson, 2004). Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder Symptoms from frontotemporal NCD occur as a re-sult of shrinking of the frontal and temporal ante-rior lobes of the brain (National Institute ofNeurological Disorders and Stroke [NINDS], 2012).This type of NCD was identified as Pick's disease inthe DSM-IV-TR. The cause of frontotemporal NCD is unknown, but a genetic factor appears to be in-volved. Symptoms tend to fall into two clinical pat-terns: (1) behavioral and personality changes and(2) speech and language problems. Common be-havioral changes include increasingly inappropriateactions, lack of judgment and inhibition, and repet-itive compulsive behavior. There may be a markedimpairment or loss of speech or increasing difficultyin using and understanding written and spoken lan-guage (Mayo Clinic, 2011). The disease progressessteadily and often rapidly, ranging from less than 2 years in some individuals to more than 10 years inothers (NINDS, 2012). Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury DSM-5 criteria states that this disorder \"is caused by an impact to the head or other mechanisms of rapidmovement or displacement of the brain within theskull, with one or more of the following: loss of con-sciousness, posttraumatic amnesia, disorientationand confusion, or neurological signs (e.g., positiveneuroimaging demonstrating injury, a new onset ofseizures or a marked worsening of a preexistingseizure disorder, visual field cuts, anosmia, hemi-paresis)\" (APA, 2013, p. 625). Amnesia is the mostcommon neurobehavioral symptom following headtrauma (Bourgeois et al., 2008). Other symptomsmay include confusion and changes in speech, vi-sion, and personality. Depending on the severity ofthe injury, these symptoms may eventually subsideor may become permanent (Smith, 2011). Repeatedhead trauma, such as the type experienced by box-ers, can result in dementia pugilistica, a syndromecharacterized by dysarthria,ataxia, Lewy Bodies Clinically, Lewy body NCD is fairly similar to AD;however, it tends to progress more rapidly, andthere is an earlier appearance of visual hallucina-tions and parkinsonian features (Rabins et al.,2006). This disorder is distinguished by the pres-ence of Lewy bodies\u2014eosinophilic inclusion bodies\u2014seen in the cerebral cortex and brainstem (Black & Andreasen, 2011). These patients are highly sen-sitive to extrapyramidal effects of antipsychoticmedications. The disease is progressive and irre- versible, and may account for as many as 25 percent ofall NCD cases. Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease NCD is observed in as many as 60 percent of clientswith Parkinson's disease (Bourgeois et al., 2008). Inthis disease, there is a loss of nerve cells located in thesubstantia nigra, and dopamine activity is diminished,resulting in involuntary muscle movements, slowness,and rigidity. Tremor in the upper extremities is char-acteristic. In some instances, the cerebral changesthat occur in NCD due to Parkinson's disease closelyresemble those of AD. Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus-type1 (HIV-1) can result in a NCD called HIV-1-associated cognitive/motor complex . A less severe form, known as HIV- 1-associated minor cognitive/motor disorder , also occurs. The severity of symptoms is correlated to the extent of brainpathology. The immune dysfunction associated withHIV disease can lead to brain infections by other organ-isms, and the HIV-1 also appears to cause NCD directly.In the early stages, neuropsychiatric symptoms may bemanifested by barely perceptible changes in a person'snormal psychological presentation. Severe cognitivechanges, particularly confusion, changes in behavior,and sometimes psychoses, are not uncommon in thelater stages. With the advent of the highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART), incidence rates of NCD due toHIV infection have been on the decline. However, it is possible that the prolonged life span of HIV-infected patients taking medications may actually in-crease the numbers of individuals living with HIV-associated NCD. Substance/Medication-Induced Neurocognitive Disorder NCD can occur as the result of substance reactions, overuse, or abuse (Davis, 2012). Symptoms are con-sistent with major or mild neurocognitive disorder,and persist beyond the usual duration of intoxicationand acute withdrawal (APA, 2013). Substances thathave been associated with the development of NCDsinclude alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics, and inhalants. Drugs that cause anticholinergic side effects, and toxins such as lead and mercury, have alsobeen implicated. Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Huntington's Disease Huntington's disease is transmitted as a Mendeliandominant gene. Damage is seen in the areas of thebasal ganglia and the cerebral cortex. The onset of symptoms (i.e., involuntary twitching of the limbs340 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch22_331-364 23/07/14 12:20 PM Page 340CHAPTER 22 Neurocognitive Disorders 341 BOX 22-2 Etiological Factors Implicated in the Development of Delirium and/or Mild or Major Neurocognitive Disorder BIOLOGICAL FACTORS Hypoxia: any condition leading to a deficiency of oxygen to the brain Nutritional deficiencies: vitamins (par ticularly B and maternal FACTORSBirth trauma: prolonged labor, damage from ners, spray paints, cleaning fluids, typewriter correction fluid, varnishes, and lacquers Heavy metals: lead, mercury, manganese Other metallic elements: aluminum muscles, mild cognitive changes, depression, and apathy) usually occurs between age 30 and 50 years. The client usually declines into a profoundstate of cognitive impairment and ataxia (muscular incoordination). The average duration of the diseaseis based on age at onset. One study concluded that ju-venile-onset and late-onset clients have the shortestduration (Foroud, Gray, Ivashina, & Conneally, 1999).In this study, the median duration of the disease was21.4 years. Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Prion Disease This disorder is identified by its insidious onset, rapidprogression, and manifestations of motor features ofprion disease, such as myoclonus or ataxia, or bio-marker evidence (APA, 2013). Five to 15 percent ofcases have a genetic component. The clinical presen-tation is typical of the syndrome of mild or majorNCD, along with involuntary movements, musclerigidity, and ataxia. Symptoms may develop at any agein adults, but typically occur between ages 40 and 60 years. The clinical course is extremely rapid, withthe progression from diagnosis to death in less than2 years (Rentz, 2008). Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition A number of other general medical conditions can cause NCD. Some of these include hypothyroidism,hyperparathyroidism, pituitary insufficiency, uremia,encephalitis, brain pernicious anemia, epilepsy, car-diopulmonary insufficiency, fluid and electrolyteimbalances, CNS and multiple &Andreasen, 2011; Puri & 2011). The etiological factors associated with delirium and NCD are summarized in Box 22-2. Application of the Nursing Process Assessment Nursing assessment of the client with delirium or mildor major NCD is based on knowledge of the sympto-matology associated with the various disorders pre-viously described in this chapter. Subjective andobjective data are gathered by various members of thehealth-care team. Clinicians report use of a variety ofmethods for obtaining assessment information. Client History Nurses play a significant role in acquiring the clienthistory, including the specific mental and physicalchanges that have occurred and the age at which thechanges began. If the client is unable to relate infor-mation adequately, the data should be obtained fromfamily members or others who would be aware of theclient's physical and psychosocial history.4092_Ch22_331-364 23/07/14 12:20 PM Page 341342 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation BOX 22-3 Mental Status Examination Age_______________ Sex______________________ Diagnosis________________________________________________ Maximum Client's Score 1.

The nurse also should obtain information regard- ing current and past medication usage, history ofother drug and alcohol use, and possible exposure totoxins. Knowledge regarding the history of relatedsymptoms or specific illnesses (e.g., Huntington's dis-ease, AD, or Parkinson's disease) in other familymembers might be useful. Physical Assessment Assessment of physical systems by both the nurse andthe physician has two main emphases: (1) signs ofdamage to the nervous system and (2) evidence of dis-eases of other organs that could affect mental func-tion. Diseases of various organ systems can induceconfusion, loss of memory, and behavioral changes.These causes must be considered in diagnosing cog-nitive disorders. In the neurological examination, theclient is asked to perform maneuvers or answer ques-tions that are designed to elicit information about the condition of specific parts of the brain or periph-eral nerves. Testing will assess mental status and alert-ness, muscle strength, reflexes, sensory perception,language skills, and coordination. An example of amental status examination for a client with NCD ispresented in Box 22-3. A battery of psychological tests may be ordered as part of the diagnostic examination. The results ofthese tests may be used to make a differential diagno-sis between NCD and pseudodementia (depression). Depression is the most common mental illness in the elderly, but it is often misdiagnosed and treated4092_Ch22_331-364 23/07/14 12:20 PM Page 342CHAPTER 22 Neurocognitive Disorders 343 BOX 22-3 Mental Status Examination for Neurocognitive Disorder\u2014cont'd 6. VERBAL STORY FOR IMMEDIATE RECALL Tell the client: \"I'm going to read you a short story, which I want you to 13 points _______________ remember. Listen closely to what I read because I will ask you to tell me the story when I finish.\" Read the story slowly and carefully, but without pausing at the slash marks. After completing the paragraph, tell the client to retell the story as accurately as possible. Record the number of correct memories (information within the slashes) and describe confabulation if it is present.

VISUAL MEMORY (HIDDEN OBJECTS) Tell the client that you are going to hide some objects around the office (desk, bed) and that you want him/her to remember where they are. Hide four or five common objects (e.g., keys, pen, reflex hammer) in various places in the client's sight. After a delay of several minutes, ask the client to find the objects.

PAIRED ASSOCIATE LEARNING Tell the client that you are going to read a list of words two at a time. The client will be expected to remember the words that go together (e.g., big\u2014little). When he/she is clear on the directions, read the first list of words at the rate of one pair per second. After reading the first list, test for recall by presenting the first recall list. Give the first word of a pair and ask for the word that was paired with it. Correct incorrect responses and proceed to the next pair. After the first recall has been completed, allow a 10-second delay and continue with the second presentation and recall lists. Presentation Lists 12 a. High\u2014Low a. Good\u2014Bad b.

Cognitive symptoms of depression may mimic NCD, and because of the prevalence of NCDin the elderly, diagnosticians are often too eager to make this diagnosis. A comparison of symptoms of NCD and pseudodementia (depression) is pre-sented in Table 22-1. Nurses can assist in this assess-ment by carefully observing and documenting thesesometimes subtle differences. Diagnostic Laboratory Evaluations The nurse also may be required to help the client ful-fill the physician's orders for special diagnostic labo-ratory evaluations. Many of these tests are routinelyincluded with the physical examination and may in-clude evaluation of blood and urine samples to testfor various infections; hepatic nutritional defi-ciencies; and presence of toxic substances, includingalcohol and other drugs. Other diagnostic evaluations may be made by electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures andrecords the brain's electrical activity. With CT scan-ning, an image of the size and shape of the brain canbe obtained. MRI is used to obtain a computerizedimage of soft tissue in the body. It provides a sharpdetailed picture of the tissues of the brain. A lumbarpuncture may be performed to examine the cere-brospinal fluid for evidence of CNS infection or hem-orrhage. Positron emission tomography (PET) is usedto reveal the metabolic activity of the brain, an evalu-ation some researchers believe is important in the diagnosis of AD. Researchers at the University of California Los Angeles used PET following injectionsof FDDNP (a molecule that binds to plaques and tan-gles in vitro) (Small et al., 2006). With this test, theresearchers were able to distinguish between subjectswith AD, those with mild cognitive impairment, andthose with no cognitive impairment. With FDDNP-PET, researchers are able to accurately diagnose ADin its earlier stages and track disease progression non-invasively in a clinical setting. The researchers hopethat this tool will help clinicians define therapeuticinterventions before neuronal death occurs, therebyretarding the progression of the disease. Nursing Diagnosis/Outcome Identification Using information collected during the assessment,the nurse completes the client database, from whichthe selection of appropriate nursing diagnoses is de-termined. Table 22-2 presents a list of client behaviorsand the NANDA nursing diagnoses that correspondto those behaviors, which may be used in planningcare for the client with a neurocognitive disorder. Outcome Criteria The following criteria may be used for measurementof outcomes in the care of the client with a neurocog-nitive disorder. The client: Has not experienced physical injury Has not harmed self or others Has maintained reality orientation to the best ofhis or her capability Is able to communicate with consistent caregiver4092_Ch22_331-364 23/07/14 12:20 PM Page 345Fulfills activities of daily living with assistance (or for client who is unable: has needs met, as antici-pated by caregiver) Discusses positive aspects about self and life Planning/Implementation Care for an individual with a NCD must focus on im-mediate needs and keeping the individual safe fromharm. Risk for Trauma Because the individual has impairments in cognitiveand psychomotor functioning, it is important to en-sure that the environment be made as safe as possibleto prevent injury. NANDA defines risk for trauma as \"at risk of accidental tissue injury (e.g., wound, burn,fracture)\" (NANDA International [NANDA-I], 2012,p. 444). Table 22-3 presents this nursing diagnosis incare plan format. Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goals Client will call for assistance when ambulating orcarrying out other activities (if it is within his or hercognitive ability). Client will maintain a calm demeanor, with minimalagitated behavior. Client will not experience physical injury.Long-Term Goal Client will not experience physical injury. Interventions Interventions for preventing injury in the cognitivelyimpaired client include the following: Arrange the furniture and other items in the roomto accommodate the client's disabilities. Ensure thatfrequently used items are stored within easy access. Keep the bed in its lowest position. If allowed byhospital regulation or accrediting body, limited useof bedrails may provide a measure of safety. A room near the nurse's station may be helpful toensure that the client has close observation. Insome instances, one-to-one observation may benecessary, particularly for the delirious client. If the client is a smoker, ensure that cigarettes andlighter are kept at the nurses' station and dis-pensed only when someone is available to stay withthe client while he or she is smoking. Assist the client with ambulation. Provide cane orwalker for balance, and instruct client in theirproper use. Transport client in wheelchair whenlonger excursions are necessary. Teach client to hold on to hand railing, if one isavailable, or to call for assistance when ambulating,if he or she is cognitively able.

Irritability, hostility, aggression, and psychotic behaviors are troublesome problemsthat require management in individuals with cog-nitive disorders. It is often these behaviors thatmake it difficult for family to care for their lovedone, and is a common cause for placement in aninstitution. Antipsychotics have historically been used to helpcontrol behavioral problems in patients with NCD.The conventional antipsychotics are problematic,however, because of their tendency to induce ex-trapyramidal side effects. The newer atypical antipsy-chotics have shown some effectiveness in controllingthese behaviors. Although antipsychotic medicationsare still used for this purpose by some physicians, theU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued black box warnings against their use in elderlypatients with NCD-related psychosis. They have been4092_Ch22_331-364 23/07/14 12:20 PM Page 347348 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation associated with increased mortality in this patient population. Remain calm and undemanding, and avoid pressingthe individual to perform activities that he or she isrefusing. It may not be possible to reason with theseclients; this may only increase the possibility for agi-tation. Practicing relaxation exercises and walkingwith the client may be of some help. For the Client Who Wanders A number of reasons have been proposed as to whyindividuals with NCD wander. Some clinicians associ-ate wandering behavior with increased stress and anx-iety or restless agitation. Others relate the behavior tostages of cognitive decline. When memory diminishesand fear sets in, individuals may wander in search ofsomething that seems familiar to them. Increasedwalking at night corresponds with disruption of diur-nal rhythm. In any event, wandering behavior in NCDcan cause great problems for caregivers. Wandering isoften a bigger problem in mid-stage NCD, and less soin later stages. Often patients new to a nursing homewill wander in an attempt to become oriented to newsurroundings. Wandering behavior can also be attrib-uted to physical causes, such as hunger, thirst, and uri-nary or fecal urgency. When the wandering behaviorbegins after a long period of stability, it is likely that anew complication may be occurring\u2014medical, psychi-atric, or cognitive. Delirium may produce the abruptonset of wandering behavior. The goals of wanderingtherapy are to keep the individual safe, to prevent in-trusion into others' rooms, and to try to determinecontributing factors to the behavior. When caring fora client who wanders, it is important to keep the fol-lowing interventions in mind: Keep the individual on a structured schedule of recreational activities and a strict feeding andtoileting schedule. Provide a safe, enclosed place for pacing and wandering. Walk with the individual for a while and gently redirect him or her back to the care unit. Ensure that outdoor exits are electronically controlled. Disturbed Thought Processes/Impaired Memory and Disturbed Sensory Perception Disturbed thought processes and sensory perception have been retired as nursing diagnoses by NANDA-I,but they are retained in this text because of their appropriateness in describing specific behaviors. Inthis instance, they are evidenced by disorientation,confusion, and inaccurate interpretation of the envi-ronment, including illusions, delusions, and halluci-nations. Disturbed thought processes has been defined asa disruption in cognitive operations and activities. Dis- turbed sensory perception is defined as a \"change in the amount or patterning of incoming stimuli accompa-nied by a diminished, exaggerated, distorted, or im-paired response to such stimuli\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 490). Impaired memory is defined as the \"inability to remember or recall bits of information or behavioralskills\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 273). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goals Client will utilize measures provided (e.g., clocks,calendars, room identification) to maintain realityorientation. Client will experience fewer episodes of acute confusion. Long-Term Goal Client will maintain reality orientation to the bestof his or her cognitive ability. Interventions For the Client Who Is Disoriented Try to keep the client as oriented to reality as possible. Use clocks and calendars with large numbers thatare easy to read. Place large colorful signs on the doors to identifyclients' rooms, bathrooms, activity rooms, diningrooms, and chapel. Allow the client to have as many of his or her per-sonal items as possible. Even an old familiar chairin the room can provide a degree of comfort. If at all possible, encourage family and close friendsto be a part of the client's care, to promote feelingsof security and orientation. Provide the client with radio, television, and musicif they are diversions the client enjoys; these mayadd a feeling of familiarity to the environment. Ensure that noise level is controlled to prevent ex-cess stimulation. Allow the client to view old photograph albumsand utilize reminiscence therapy. These are excel-lent ways to provide orientation to reality. Maintain consistency of staff and caregivers to thebest extent possible. Familiarity promotes comfortand feelings of security. Continuously monitor for medication side effects.Physiological changes in the elderly can alter thebody's response to certain medications. Toxic ef-fects may intensify altered cognitive processes. There has been some criticism in recent yearsabout reality orientation of individuals with NCD4092_Ch22_331-364 23/07/14 12:20 PM Page 348CHAPTER 22 Neurocognitive Disorders 349 BOX 22-4 Validation Therapy Some people believe it is not helpful (and sometimes even cruel) to try to insist that a person with moderate to severe NCD continually try to grasp what we know as the \"real world.\" Allen (2000) states, There is no successful alternative but to accept whatever the dementia person claims as their reality, no matter howuntrue it is to us. There is no successful way to 'force' a person with dementia to join the 'real' world. The most frustratedcaregivers are the ones who do not accept this simple fact: the world of dementia is defined by the dementia victim. Validation therapy (VT) was originated by Naomi Feil, a gerontological social worker, who describes the process as \"com- municating with a disoriented elderly person by validating and respecting their feelings in whatever time or place is real to them at the time, even though this may not correspond with our 'here and now' reality\" (Day, 2013). Feil suggests that thevalidation principle is truthful to the person with NCD because people live on several levels of awareness (Feil, 2013). Shesuggests that if an individual asks to see his or her spouse, and the spouse has been dead for many years, that on some levelof awareness, that person knows the truth. To keep reminding the person that the spouse is dead may only serve to causerepeated episodes of grief and distress, as he or she receives the information \"anew\" each time it is presented (Allen, 2000). Validation therapy validates the feelings and emotions of a person with NCD. It often also integrates redirection techniques. Allen (2000) states, \"The key is to 'agree' with what they want but by conversation and 'steering' get them to do somethingelse without them realizing they are actually being redirected. This is both validation and redirection therapy.\" EXAMPLES Mrs. W (agitated): \"That old lady stole my watch! I know she did. She goes into people's rooms and takes our things. We call her 'sticky fingers'!\" Nurse: That watch is very important to you. Have you looked around the room for it?\" Mrs. W: \"My husband gave it to me. He will be so upset that it is gone. I'm afraid to tell him.\" Nurse: \"I'm sure you miss your husband very much. Tell me what it was like when you were together. What kinds of things did you do for fun?\" Mrs. W: \"We did a lot of traveling. To Italy, and England, and France. We ate wonderful food.\"Nurse: \"Speaking of food, it is lunch time, and I will walk with you to the dining room.\"Mrs. W: \"Yes, I'm getting really hungry.\" In this situation, the nurse validated Mrs. W's feelings about not being able to find her watch. She did not deny that it had been stolen, nor did she remind Mrs. W that her husband was deceased. ( Remember: a concept of VT is that on some level, Mrs. W knows that her husband is dead. ) The nurse validated the emotions Mrs. W was feeling about missing her husband. She brought up special times that Mrs. W and her husband had spent together, which served to elevate her moodand self-esteem. And lastly, she redirected Mrs. W to the dining room to have her lunch. (The watch was eventually foundin Mrs. W's medicine cabinet, where she had hidden it for safekeeping.) Feil (2013) presents another example: When a resident asks for his wife who is dead, caregivers reply, \"She'll be here to see you later.\" The resident may not remember much, but he clings to that statement. He continues to ask for his wife on a daily basis, and the caregiverscontinue to lie. Eventually he loses trust in the caregivers, knowing that what they say is not true. With VT, the caregiverswould encourage the resident to talk about his wife. They would validate his emotions, and encourage him to expresshis needs, accepting the fact that there is a reason behind his behavior. He has not simply \"forgotten that his wifedied;\" he needs to grieve for her. This is unfinished business. When the emotion is expressed and someone listenswith empathy, it is relieved. The old man no longer needs to search for his wife. He feels safe with the caregiver, whomhe trusts. He always knew on a deep level of awareness that his wife had died. (pp. 3, 4) (particularly those with moderate to severe disease process), suggesting that constant relearning ofmaterial contributes to problems with mood andself-esteem (Spector, Davies, Woods, & Orrell,2000). (See Box 22-4, Validation Therapy.) For the Client With Delusions and Hallucinations Discourage rumination of delusional thinking. Donot disagree with made up stories. Instead, gentlycorrect the client, and guide the conversation toward topics about real events and real people.Never argue a point with the client; to do so onlyserves to increase his or her anxiety and agitation. Do not ignore reports of hallucinations when it is clear that the client is experiencing them. It is important for the nurse to hear an explanation ofthe hallucination from the client. These percep-tions are very real and often very frightening to theclient. Unless they are appropriately managed, hal-lucinations can escalate into disturbing and evenhostile behaviors. Visual and auditory hallucina-tions are the most common type in NCD.

Rule out the disturbed sensory perception as a pos-sible side effect of certain physical conditions ormedications. Check to ensure that hearing aid is working prop-erly and to ensure that faulty sounds are not beingemitted. Check eyeglasses to ensure that the individual is indeed wearing his or her own glasses. Try to determine from where the visual hallucina-tion is emanating. Clients often see faces in patterns on fabrics or in pictures on the wall. A mir-ror can also be the culprit of false perceptions.These may need to be moved or covered. Provide reassurance that the client is safe. It maybe necessary to stay with the client for a while untilhe or she is calm. Never argue that the hallucination is not real. Tryto let the client know that, although you are notsharing their experience, you understand how verydistressing it is for him or her. Distract the client. Hallucinations are less likely to occur when the person is occupied or involvedin what is going on around them. Focus on real situations and real people. Depending on the situation, it may be better to go along with the client rather than attempting to distract him or her (McShane, 2000). Not all hallucinations are upsetting. EXAMPLE An elderly woman approaches the nurses' station and says, \"I'm so perturbed. The woman in my room refuses to turndown my bed so that I can go to sleep.\" The nurse may re-spond, \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience, Mrs. G., but I will walkto your room with you and see that your bed is turned down.\"The nurse chats with Mrs. G. about something that occurredduring the day, and by the time they arrive at her room, thereis no further mention of a woman in her room. Impaired Verbal Communication When individuals who are cognitively impaired begin to lose their ability to process verbal communication,how words are expressed becomes as important aswhat is said. NANDA defines impaired verbal communi- cation as \"decreased, delayed, or absent ability to receive, process, transmit, and/or use a system of sym-bols\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 275). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goals Client will be able to make needs known to primarycaregiver.Client is able to understand basic communicationsin interactions with primary caregiver. Long-Term Goal (In later stages of the illness, when client is unableto communicate), needs are anticipated and ful-filled by primary caregiver. Interventions Keep interactions with the client calm and reassuring. Use simple words, speak slowly and distinctly, andkeep face-to-face contact with the client. Always identify yourself to the client, and call theclient by name at each meeting. Use nonverbal gestures to help the client under-stand what you want him or her to accomplish, ifappropriate. Ask only one question (or give only one direction)at a time, and give the client plenty of time toprocess the information and respond. The ques-tion may need to be rephrased if it is clear that theclient has not understood the meaning of the di-rection. Always try to approach the client from the front.An unexpected approach or touch from behindmay startle and upset the client, and may evenpromote aggressive behavior. Maintain consistency of staff and caregivers to thebest extent possible. This facilitates comfort andsecurity and promotes an effective communicationprocess with the client. Should the client become verbally aggressive, re-main calm, and provide validation for his or herfeelings: \"I know this is a hard time for you. Youwere always so busy and so active, and you took careof so many people. Maybe you could tell me aboutsome of those people.\" When it is clearly appropriate, use touch and af-fection to communicate. Sometimes clients willrespond to a hug or to a hand reaching for theirswhen they will respond to nothing else. Self-Care Deficit It is important for clients to remain as independentas possible for as long as possible. They should be en-couraged to accomplish ADLs to the best of their abil-ity. NANDA defines self-care deficit as \"impaired ability to of daily living] for self\"(NANDA-I, 2012, pp. 250-253). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal Client will participate in ADLs with assistance fromcaregiver.4092_Ch22_331-364 23/07/14 12:20 PM Page 350CHAPTER 22 Neurocognitive Disorders 351 Long-Term Goals Client will accomplish ADLs to the best of his or her ability. Unfulfilled needs will be met by caregiver. Interventions Provide a simple, structured environment for theclient, identify self-care deficits, and offer assistanceas required. Allow plenty of time for the client to complete tasks. Provide guidance and support for independent ac-tions by talking the client through the task one stepat a time. Provide a structured schedule of activities that doesnot change from day to day. Ensure that ADLs follow the client's usual routineas closely as possible. Minimize confusion by providing for consistencyin assignment of daily caregivers. Perform an ongoing assessment of the client's abilityto fulfill his or her nutritional needs, ensure personalsafety, follow the medication regimen, and commu-nicate the need for assistance with activities that heor she cannot accomplish independently. Anticipateneeds that are not verbally communicated. If the client is to be discharged to family caregivers,assess those caregivers' ability to anticipate and ful-fill client's unmet needs. Provide information to as-sist caregivers with this responsibility. Ensure thatcaregivers are aware of available community sup-port systems from which they may seek assistancewhen required. Examples include adult day-carecenters, housekeeping and homemaker services,respite care services, or the local chapter of a na-tional support organization. Two of these includethe following: For N.W. 9th Ave.Miami, FL 33136-14941-800-272-3900http://www.parkinson.org Concept Care Mapping The concept map care plan is an innovative approachto planning and organizing nursing care (see Chapter9). It is a diagrammatic teaching and learning strategythat allows visualization of interrelationships amongmedical diagnoses, nursing diagnoses, assessment data,and treatments. An example of a concept map careplan for a client with a neurocognitive disorder is pre-sented in Figure 22-3. Client/Family Education The role of client teacher is important in the psychiatricarea, as it is in all areas of nursing. A list of topics forclient/family education relevant to neurocognitive dis-orders is presented in Box 22-5. Sample client teachingguides can be found online at davisplus.fadavis.com. Evaluation In the final step of the nursing process, reassess-ment occurs to determine if the nursing interven-tions have been effective in achieving the intendedgoals of care. Evaluation of the client with a NCD isbased on a series of short-term goals rather than onlong-term goals. Resolution of identified problemsis unrealistic for this client. Instead, outcomes mustbe measured in terms of slowing down the processrather than stopping or curing the problem. Evalu-ation questions may include the following: Has the client experienced injury? Does the client maintain orientation to time, per-son, place, and situation to the best of his or hercognitive ability? Is the client able to fulfill basic needs? Have thoseneeds unmet by the client been fulfilled by caregivers? Is confusion minimized by familiar objects andstructured, routine schedule of activities? Do the prospective caregivers have information regarding the progression of the client's illness? Do caregivers have information regarding where togo for assistance and support in the care of theirloved one? Have the prospective caregivers received instruc-tion in how to promote the client's safety, minimizeconfusion and disorientation, and cope with diffi-cult client behaviors (e.g., hostility, anger, depres-sion, agitation)? Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) The Institute of Medicine (IOM), in its 2003 report, Health Professions Education: A Bridge to Quality, challengedfaculties of medicine, nursing, and other health profes-sions to ensure that their graduates have achieved a coreset of competencies in order to meet the needs of the21st-century health-care system. These competencies in-clude providing patient-centered care, working in interdiscipli- nary teams, employing evidence-based practice, applying qualityimprovement, ensuring safety, andutilizing informatics. A QSEN teaching strategy is included in Box 22-6. The useof this type of activity is intended to arm the instructorand the student with guidelines for attaining the knowl-edge, skills, and attitudes necessary for achievement ofquality and safety competencies in nursing.4092_Ch22_331-364 23/07/14 12:20 PM Page 351Clinical Vignette: Sarah, age 82, a widow of many years, has been admitted to a long-term care facility with a diagnosis of NCD due to Alzheimer's disease. She is confused about her whereabouts and says to the nurse, \"I think I've been here long enough now. It's time for me to go home. I'll just call my husband to come get me.\" She wandersaround the unit and cannot find her room. She attempts to go out the locked door to the outside and sets off the alarm.With much reluctance, she allows the nurse to help her get ready for bed. The nurse discovers her awake in themiddle of the night and wandering into other patients' rooms. She appears in the dining room the next morningbarefoot and wearing her pajamas.

Additional attention must be given to fluidand electrolyte status, hypoxia, anoxia, and diabeticproblems. Staff members should remain with theclient at all times to monitor behavior and provide reorientation and assurance. The room should main-tain a low level of stimuli. Some physicians prefer not to prescribe medica- tions for the client with delirium, reasoning that additional agents may only compound the syndromeof brain dysfunction. However, the agitation and aggression demonstrated by the client with delirium4092_Ch22_331-364 23/07/14 12:20 PM Page 352CHAPTER 22 Neurocognitive Disorders 353 BOX 22-6 QSEN TEACHING STRATEGY Assignment: Linking Evidence-Based Practice With a Nursing Procedure Reality Orientation of Clients With Neurocognitive Disorder Competency Domain: Evidence-Based Practice Learning Objectives: Student will: \u0081Locate an evidence-based practice article on a hospital protocol, and compare and contrast this information with the facility's protocol. \u0081Identify whether evidence-based practice is utilized with this protocol, and identify barriers or challenges with implementing evidence-based practice in the clinical setting. Strategy Overview: 1.Research the nursing intervention of reality orientation of clients with NCD. Identify the pros and cons and ethicalissues associated with this intervention (particularly with clients who have advanced NCD). 2.Find an evidence-based practice journal ar ticle about the intervention. 3.Locate the facility's protocol for reality orientation of clients with NCD. 4.Compare and contrast the facility's protocol with how unit staff carry out this intervention. If there are deviationsfrom the written protocol, what are they and why do they occur? 5.Compare and contrast the hospital's protocol with the information found in the evidence-based practice article. 6.At postconference, summarize the article on evidence-based practice to the clinical group, and report informationgathered throughout the clinical day . Discuss any ethical dilemmas associated with the intervention. 7.W rite a paper discussing personal reflections and feelings about this intervention.

Choice of specific ther-apy is made with consideration for the client's clinical condition and the underlying cause of the delirium.Low-dose antipsychotics are the pharmacologicaltreatment of choice in most cases (Schatzberg, Cole, & DeBattista, 2010). A benzodiazepine (e.g., lorazepam) is commonly used when the etiology is sub-stance withdrawal (Eisendrath & Lichtmacher, 2012). Neurocognitive Disorder Once a definitive diagnosis of NCD has been made, aprimary consideration in the treatment of the disor-der is the etiology. Focus must be directed to the iden-tification and resolution of potentially reversibleprocesses. Sadock and Sadock (2007)stated: Once dementia is diagnosed, patients must undergo a complete medical and neurological workup, be-cause 10 to 15 percent of all patients with dementiahave a potentially reversible condition if treatment isinitiated before permanent brain damage occurs.[Causes of potentially-reversible NCD include] hy-pothyroidism, normal pressure hydrocephalus, andbrain tumors. (p. 340) The need for general supportive care, with pro- visions for security, stimulation, patience, and nutri- tion, has been recognized and accepted. A numberof pharmaceutical agents have been tried, with vary-ing degrees of success, in the treatment of clientswith NCD. Some of these drugs are described in thefollowing sections according to symptomatology forwhich they are indicated. A summary of medicationsfor clients with NCD is provided in Table 22-4.

Other cholinesterase inhibitors are also being used for treatment of mild to moderate cognitive im-pairment in AD. (Higher dose donepezil has alsobeen approved for moderate to severe AD.) Some ofthe clinical manifestations of AD are thought to bethe result of a deficiency of the neurotransmitteracetylcholine. In the brain, acetylcholine acetylcholinesterase,which slows the degradation of acetylcholine,thereby increasing concentrations of the neurotrans-mitter in the cerebral cortex. Because their actionrelies on functionally intact cholinergic neurons, theeffects of these medications may lessen as the diseaseprocess advances, and there is no evidence thatthese medications alter the course of the underlyingdegenerative process. Another medication, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, was approved by theFDA in 2003. The medication, memantine (Na-menda), was approved for the treatment of moderateto severe AD. High levels of glutamate in the brainsof AD patients are thought to contribute to the symp-tomatology and decline in functionality. These highlevels are caused by a dysfunction in glutamate trans-mission. In normal neurotransmission, glutamateplays an essential role in learning and memory by trig-gering NMDA receptors to allow a controlled amountof calcium to flow into a nerve cell. This creates theappropriate environment for information processing.In AD, there is a sustained release of glutamate, whichresults in a continuous influx of calcium into thenerve cells. This increased intracellular calcium con-centration ultimately leads to disruption and death of the neurons. Memantine may protect cells againstexcess glutamate by partially blocking NMDA recep-tors. Memantine has been shown in clinical trials tobe effective in improving cognitive function and theability to perform ADLs in clients with moderate tosevere AD. Although it does not stop or reverse theeffects of the disease, it has been shown to slow downthe progression of the decline in cognition and func-tion (Salloway & Correia, 2009). Because meman-tine's action differs from that of the cholinesteraseinhibitors, consideration is being given to possible co-administration of these medications. Ongoing research is revealing a greater improvement in cogni-tive function, ADLs, behavior, and clinical global sta-tus in clients who are administered a combination ofmemantine and a cholinesterase inhibitor than thoseadministered either drug alone (Diamond, 2008).4092_Ch22_331-364 23/07/14 12:20 PM Page 355Current drug trials are under way to test for a vac- cine against AD. One recent study led by the Karolin- ska Institutet in Sweden reports positive use withCAD106, a vaccine designed to trigger the body's im-mune defense against beta-amyloid (Winblad et al.,2012). In a study funded by the U.S. Institutes ofHealth, three drugs are currently in clinical trials tobe evaluated in the prevention of a rare and aggres-sive form of autosomal-dominant AD (Bateman et al.,2012). This study includes individuals who are muta-tion carriers, and are therefore genetically destinedto develop AD at a young age, typically when they arein their 30s, 40s, or 50s. Because these individuals ex-hibit measurable biochemical and imaging changesup to 25 years before AD symptoms appear, the drugswill target these biomarkers to determine if the treat-ment can stop or slow the disease process. Agitation, Aggression, Hallucinations, Thought Disturbances, and Wandering Historically, physicians have prescribed antipsychotic medications to control agitation, aggression, halluci-nations, thought disturbances, and wandering inclients with ziprasidone, often favored because of theirlessened propensity to cause anticholinergic and ex-trapyramidal side effects. In 2005, however, followingreview of a number of studies, the FDA ordered blackbox warnings on drug labels of all the atypical antipsy-chotics noting that the drugs are associated with an in-creased risk of death in elderly patients with psychoticbehaviors associated with NCD. Most of the deaths ap-peared to be cardiovascular related. In July 2008,based on the results of several studies, the FDA ex-tended this warning to include all first-generation antipsychotics as well, such as haloperidol and per-phenazine. This poses a clinical dilemma for physi-cians who have found these medications to be helpfulto their clients, and some have chosen to continue touse them in clients without significant cerebrovasculardisease, in which previous behavioral programs havefailed, and with consent from relatives or guardianswho are clearly aware of the risks and benefits. Anticholinergic Effects Many antipsychotic, antidepressant, and antihista-minic medications produce anticholinergic side effects, which include confusion, blurred vision, con-stipation, dry mouth, dizziness, and difficulty urinat-ing. Older people, and especially those with NCD,are particularly sensitive to these effects because ofdecreased cholinergic reserves. Many elderly individ-uals are also at increased risk for developing an anti-cholinergic toxicity syndrome because of the additiveanticholinergic effects of multiple medications (Hall,Hall, & Chapman, 2009).Depression It is estimated that up to 40 percent of people withAD also suffer from major depression (Alzheimer'sAssociation, 2013b). Recognizing the symptoms of depression in these individuals is often a challenge.Depression\u2014which affects thinking, memory, sleep,appetite, and interferes with daily life\u2014is sometimesdifficult to distinguish from NCD. Clearly, the exis-tence of depression in the client with NCD compli-cates and worsens the individual's functioning. Antidepressant medication is sometimes used in treatment of depression in NCD. The selective sero-tonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered by many to be the first-line drug treatment for de-pression in the elderly because of their favorableside effect profile. Although still used by some physi-cians, tricyclic antidepressants are often avoided because of cardiac and anticholinergic side effects.Trazodone may be a good choice, used at depression and insomnia. Dopaminergic agents(e.g., methylphenidate, amantadine, bromocriptine,and be helpful in the treatment ofsevere apathy (Rabins et al., 2006). Not only is depression common in AD, but research has recently suggested that it may be a risk factor for thedisease (Geerlings, den Heijer, Koudstaal, Hofman, &Breteler, 2008). This study found that individuals with ahistory of depression, particularly those with onset be-fore age 60, had a 2.5 times greater risk of developingAD than people who had not suffered from depression.The authors suggest that further studies are required tounderstand the relationship between depression andAD. It is not completely understood whether depressioncontributes to the development of AD or whether an-other unknown factor is involved in the etiology of both.In another study, Caraci, Copani, Nicoletti, and that mechanisms and cascadesthat underlie the pathogenesis of major depression,such as chronic inflammation and hyperactivation of hy-pothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, are also involved inthe pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease\" (p. 64). Anxiety The progressive loss of mental functioning is a signif-icant source of anxiety in the early stages of NCD. Itis important that clients be encouraged to verbalizetheir feelings and fears associated with this loss. Theseinterventions may be useful in reducing the anxietyof clients with NCD. Antianxiety medications may be helpful but should not be used routinely or for prolonged periods. Theleast toxic and most effective of the antianxiety with shorter half-lives356 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch22_331-364 23/07/14 12:20 PM Page 356CHAPTER 22 Neurocognitive Disorders 357 (e.g., lorazepam and oxazepam) are preferred to those longer-acting medications (e.g., diazepam),which promote a higher risk of oversedation and falls.Barbiturates are not appropriate as antianxiety agentsbecause they frequently induce confusion and para-doxical excitement in elderly individuals. Sleep Disturbances Sleep problems are common in clients with NCD andoften intensify as the disease progresses. Wakefulnessand nighttime wandering create much distress andanguish in family members who are charged with pro-tection of their loved one. Indeed, sleep disturbancesare among the problems that most frequently initiatethe need for placement of the client in a long-termcare facility. Some physicians treat sleep problems with sedative- hypnotic medications. The benzodiazepines may beuseful for some clients but are indicated for relativelybrief periods only. Examples include flurazepam (Dal-mane), temazepam (Restoril), and triazolam (Hal-cion). Daytime sedation and impairment, in addition to paradoxical agitation in elderly clients,are of particular concern with these Daytime sedation may also be a problemwith these medications. As previously stated, barbitu-rates should not be used in elderly clients. Sleep prob-lems are usually ongoing, and most clinicians prefer touse medications only to help an individual through ashort-term stressful situation. Rising at the same timeeach morning; minimizing daytime sleep; participatingin regular physical exercise (but no later than 4 hoursbefore bedtime); getting proper nutrition; avoiding al-cohol, caffeine, and nicotine; and retiring at the sametime each night are behavioral approaches to sleepproblems that may eliminate the need for sleep aids,particularly in the early stages of NCD. Because of thetremendous potential for adverse drug reactions in theelderly, many of whom are already taking multiple med-ications, pharmacological treatment of insomniashould be considered only after attempts at nonphar-macological strategies have failed. CASE STUDY AND SAMPLE CARE PLAN NURSING HISTORY AND ASSESSMENT Carmen is an 81-year-old widow who has lived in the same small town, in the same house that she shared with her hus-band until his death 16 years ago. She and her husbandreared two daughters, Joan and Nancy, who have been livingwith their husbands in a large city about 2 hours away fromCarmen. They have always visited Carmen every 1 or 2 months. She has four grown grandchildren who live in dis-tant states, and who see their grandmother on holidays. About a year ago, Carmen's daughters began to receive reports from friends and other family members about incidents in which Carmen was becoming forgetful (e.g.,forgetting to go to a cousin's birthday party, taking a wrongturn and getting lost on the way to a niece's house [whereshe had driven many times], returning to church to searchfor something she thought she \"had forgotten\" [althoughshe could not explain what it was], sending birthday giftsto people when it was not their birthday). During routinevisits, the elder daughter, Joan, found bills left unpaid,sometimes months overdue. Housekeepers and yardworkers reported to Joan that Carmen would forget shehad paid them, and try to pay them again . . . and some-times a third time. She became very confused when shewould attempt to fill her weekly pillboxes, a task she hadcompleted in the past without difficulty. Hundreds of dollarswould disappear from her wallet, and she could not tellJoan what happened to it. Joan and her husband subsequently moved to the small town where Carmen lived. They bought a home, and Joanvisited her mother every day, took care of finances, and en-sured that Carmen took her daily medications, although Joanworked in a job that required occasional out of town travel. Asthe months progressed, Carmen's cognitive abilities deterio-rated. She burned food on the stove, left the house with thebroiler-oven on, forgot to take her medication, got lost in hercar, missed appointments, and forgot the names of her neigh-bors whom she had known for many years. She began to loseweight because she was forgetting to eat her meals. Carmen was evaluated by a neurologist, who diag- nosed her with neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer'sdisease. Because they believed that Carmen needed 24-hour care, Joan and Nancy made the painful decisionto place Carmen in long-term care. In the nursing home,her condition has continued to deteriorate. Carmen wan-ders up and down the halls (day and night), and she hasfallen twice, once while attempting to get out of bed. Sherequires assistance to shower and dress, and has becomeincontinent of urine. The nurses found her attempting toleave the building, saying, \"I'm going across the street tovisit my daughter.\" One morning at breakfast she appearedin her pajamas in the communal dining room, not realizingthat she had not dressed. She is unable to form newmemories, and sometimes uses confabulation to fill in theblanks. She asks the same questions repeatedly, some-times struggling for the right word. She can no longer pro-vide the correct names of items in her environment. Shehas no concept of time. Joan visits Carmen daily, and Nancy visits weekly, each offering support to the other in person and by phone. Car-men always seems pleased to see them, but can no longercall either of them by name. They are unsure if she knowswho they are. 4092_Ch22_331-364 23/07/14 12:20 PM Page 357358 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation CASE STUDY AND SAMPLE CARE PLAN\u2014cont'd NURSING DIAGNOSES/OUTCOME IDENTIFICATION From the assessment data, the nurse develops the follow- ing nursing diagnoses for Carmen: 1.Risk for trauma related to impairments in cognitive and psychomotor functioning; wandering; falls a.Outcome Criteria: Carmen will remain injury during her nursing home stay . b.Shor t-Term Goals: Carmen will not fall while wandering the halls. Carmen will not fall out of bed. 2.Disturbed thought processes related to cerebral de- generation evidenced by disorientation, confusion, and memory deficits a.Outcome Criteria: Carmen will maintain reality ori- entation to the best of her cognitive ability . b.Shor t-Term Goals: Carmen will be able to find her room. Carmen will be able to communicate her needs to staff. 3.Self-care deficit related to cognitive impairments, dis- orientation, confusion, and memory deficits a.Outcome Criteria: Carmen will accomplish ADLs to the best of her ability . b.Shor t-Term Goals: Carmen will assist with dressing herself. Carmen will cooperate with trips to the bathroom. Carmen will wash herself in the shower, with helpfrom the nurse. PLANNING/IMPLEMENTATION RISK FOR TRAUMA The following nursing interventions may be implemented in an effort to ensure client safety: 1.Arrange the furniture in Carmen's room so that it will accommodate her moving around freely. 2.Store frequently used items within her easy reach. 3.Provide a \"low bed,\" or possibly move her mattressfrom the bed to the floor , to prevent falls from bed. 4.Attach a bed alarm to aler t the nurse's station when Carmen has alighted from her bed. 5.Keep a dim light on in her room at night. 6.During the day and evening, provide a well-lighted areawhere Carmen can safely wander . 7.Ensure that all outside doors are electronically controlled. 8.Play soft music and maintain a low level of stimuli inthe environment. DISTURBED THOUGHT PROCESSES The following nursing interventions may be implemented to help maintain orientation and aid in memory and recognition: 1.Use clocks and calendars with large numbers that areeasy to read.2.Put a sign on Carmen's door with her name on it, andhang a personal item of hers on the door . 3.Ask Joan to bring some of Carmen's personal items for herroom, even a favorite comfy chair , if possible. Ask also for some old photograph albums if they are available. 4.Keep staff and caregivers to a minimum to promote fa-miliarity . 5.Speak slowly and clearly while looking into Carmen's face. 6.Use reminiscence therapy with Carmen. Ask her to sharehappy times from her life with you. T his technique helps decrease depression and boost self-esteem. 7.Mention the date and time in casual conversation. Referto rain,\" \"summer flowers,\" \"fall misperceptions gently and matter-of-factly , and focus on real events and real people if false ideas shouldoccur . V alidate her feelings associated with current and past life situations. 9.Monitor for medication side effects, because toxic effectsfrom cer t ain medications can intensify altered thought processes. SELF-CARE DEFICIT The following nursing interventions may be implemented to ensure that all Carmen's needs are fulfilled: 1.Assess what Carmen can do independently and withwhat she needs assistance. 2.Allow plenty of time for her to accomplish tasks that arewithin her ability . Clothing with easy removal or replace- ment, such as V elcro, facilitates independence. 3.Provide guidance and support for independent actionsby talking her through tasks one step at a time. 4.Provide a structured schedule of activities that does notchange from day to day . 5.Ensure that Carmen has snacks between meals. 6.T ake Carmen to the bathroom regularly (according to her usual pattern, e.g., after meals, before bedtime, on arising). 7.To minimize nighttime wetness, offer fluid every 2 hoursduring the day and restrict fluid after 6 p.m. 8.To promote more restful nighttime sleep (and less wan-dering at night), reduce naps during late afternoon andencourage sitting exercises, walking, and ball toss. Carbo-hydrate snacks at bedtime may also be helpful. EVALUATION The outcome criteria identified for Carmen have been met.She has experienced no injury. She has not fallen out ofbed. She continues to wander in a safe area. She can findher room by herself, but occasionally requires some assis-tance when she is anxious and more confused.

Ensuring that she takes care of her own ADLs, to prevent dependence Summary and Key Points Neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) constitute a large and growing public health concern. Delirium is a disturbance of awareness and achange in cognition that develop rapidly over ashort period. Level of consciousness is often af-fected and psychomotor activity may fluctuate be-tween agitated purposeless movements and avegetative state resembling catatonic stupor. The symptoms of delirium usually begin quiteabruptly and often are reversible and brief. Delirium may be caused by a general medical con-dition, substance intoxication or withdrawal, or in-gestion of a medication or exposure to a toxin. NCD is a syndrome of acquired, persistent intellec-tual impairment with compromised function inmultiple spheres of mental activity, such as mem-ory, language, visuospatial skills, emotion or per-sonality, and cognition. Symptoms of NCD are insidious and develop slowlyover time. In most clients, the disorder runs a pro-gressive, irreversible course. NCD may be caused by genetics, cardiovascular dis-ease, infections, neurophysiological disorders, andother general medical conditions.Nursing care of the client with a NCD is presentedaround the six steps of the nursing process. Objectives of care for the client experiencing anacute syndrome are aimed at eliminating the etiol-ogy, promoting client safety, and returning to thehighest possible level of functioning. Objectives of care for the client experiencing a chronic, progressive disorder are aimed at preserv-ing the dignity of the individual, promoting deceler-ation of the symptoms, and maximizing functionalcapabilities. Nursing interventions are also directed towardhelping the client's family or primary caregiverslearn about a chronic, progressive neurocognitivedisorder. Education is provided about the disease process,expectations of client behavioral changes, methodsfor facilitating care, and sources of assistance andsupport as they struggle, both physically and emo-tionally, with the demands brought on by a diseaseprocess that is slowly taking their loved one awayfrom them.

(2005). A model of consequences of need-driven, de-mentia-compromised behavior. Journal of Nursing Scholarship, 37 (2), 134-140. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: Need-driven, dementia-com- promised behavior (N DB) occurs because the careg iver is unable to comprehend needs, and the person with neu-rocognitive disorder (NCD) cannot make needs known.The behaviors are viewed as an attempt on the part of theperson with the disorder to communicate a need and asa symptom that the need is not being met. The authorsextend the primary need model to encompass secondaryneeds when primary needs go unresolved. From an ex-tensive literature review, the authors proposed a frame-work for improving understanding of the person with aNCD and the consequences of behavioral symptoms andunmet needs. RESULTS OF THE STUDY: The experiences of people with NCD who have unmet needs is described as having \"cascadingeffects. \" In people with NCD, basic needs (e.g., t hirst/need for fluid) result in primary NDB (e.g., restlessness/re petitive movements), which if left unmet may result in the negativeoutcome of constipation and abdominal discomfort. Thisneed for relief may lead to the secondary NDB of aggression.The authors state, \"Secondary NDBs are iatrogenic outcomesof these cascading effects and the response of a vulnerableperson to the recurrent and unpredictable stress of treatmenttargeted inappropriately or care providers who dismiss theNDB communication.\" Common problematic behaviors thatmay be associated with unmet needs include resistance to care, verbal complaining, restlessness, facial grimacing, aggression, crying, moaning, calling out, exiting behavior, tensebody parts, and rubbing or holding a body part. Unmet needsmay also influence affective status (e.g., depression or anxiety), physical status (e.g., immune suppression), and acceleration in functional status. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The authors of this study state, \"T he consequences of need-driven dementia-compromised behavior theory indicates that meeting needs of people with dementia will moderate thesequence of events that leads to negative outcomes.\"When caregivers cannot understand primary NDBs, theycannot provide anticipatory care. The anticipation and ful-fillment of clients' needs is necessary to decrease theprevalence and severity of new unmet needs, therebypositively influencing comfort and quality of life for peoplewith neurocognitive disorders.

He was also having trouble athome, failing to keep his finances straight, and forgetting to paybills. It became increasingly difficult for him to function properly atwork, and eventually he was forced to retire. Cognitive deteriorationcontinued, and behavioral problems soon began. He became stub-born, verbally and physically abusive, and suspicious of most every-one in his environment. His wife and son convinced him to see aphysician, who recommended hospitalization for testing. At Joe's initial evaluation, he was fully alert and cooperative but obviously anxious and fidgety. He thought he was at his accountingoffice and he could not state what year it was. He could not saythe names of his parents or siblings, nor did he know who was cur-rently the president of the United States. He could not perform sim-ple arithmetic calculations, write a proper sentence, or copy adrawing. He interpreted proverbs concretely and had difficulty stat-ing similarities between related objects. Laboratory serum studies revealed no abnormalities, but a CT scan showed marked cortical atrophy. The physician's diagnosis wasneurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease. Answer the following questions related to Joe: 1.Identify the pertinent assessment data from which nursing carewill be devised. 2.What is the primary nursing diagnosis for Joe? 3.How would outcomes be identified? Communication Exercises 1.Mrs. B is a patient on the Alzheimer's unit. The nurse hears her yelling, \"Waitress! Waitress! Whycan't I get some service around here?!\" \u0081How would the nurse respond appropriately to this statement by Mrs. B? 2.Mrs. B, who had breakfast an hour ago, says to thenurse, \"I've been waiting and waiting for my break-fast. On the farm, we always had breakfast by 6 o'clock. Those were the good old days.\" \u0081How would the nurse respond appropriately to this statement by Mrs. B? IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE\u2014 cont'd participants consisted of 21,123 people who were still alive and members of the health plan in 1994. Diagnosesof NCD were ascertained from electronic medical recordsbetween January 1, 1994, and July 31, 2008, and resultswere adjusted for age, sex, education, race, marital status,hypertension, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), di-abetes, heart disease, stroke, and alcohol use. The averageage in 1994 at the onset of the NCD follow-up was 71.6years. RESULTS OF THE STUDY: During a mean follow-up period of 23 years, about 25 percent of the group (5,367 people) were diagnosed as having a NCD, with 1,136 identified as Alzheimer disease and 416 as vascular NCD. The study revealed the following data: \u0081Those diagnosed with NCD were older, had fewer years of education, and were more likely to be female. \u0081Compared to whites, African Americans were morelikely to have NCD, whereas Asians were less likely. \u0081A higher percentage of those with a NCD diagnosiswere divorced, widowed, or separated. \u0081A higher percentage of those with a NCD diagnosiswere \"never drinkers\" of alcohol.\u0081Those with a higher mean BMI andall associated comorbidities. \u0081Former smoking or smoking less than 0.5 pack per day at midlife was not associated with NCD in later life. \u0081Compared to nonsmokers, smoking less than 2 packsper day at midlife was associated with an increased riskof NCD, but study statistics were not significant. \u0081Those who smoked more than 2 packs per day inmidlife had a greater than 100 percent risk of developing NCD. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: This study provides yet another reason for nurses to be involved in helping in- dividuals to stop smoking, and for those who do not smoke,to emphasize the impor tance of not star ting. Educational programs aimed at individuals of all ages that emphasizethe health hazards associated with smoking are well withinthe scope of nursing practice. The authors of this study state,\"The large detrimental impact that smoking already has onpublic health has the potential to become even greater asthe population worldwide ages and dementia prevalenceincreases\" (p. 338). 4092_Ch22_331-364 23/07/14 12:20 PM Page 362CHAPTER 22 Neurocognitive Disorders 363 Retrieved from http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/publica- tion/alzheimers-disease-genetics-fact-sheet American Psychiatric Association.

This chapter discusses addiction, intoxication, and withdrawal. The remain-der of the substance-induced disorders are includedin the chapters with which they share symptomatology(e.g., substance-induced depressive disorder is in-cluded in Chapter 25; substance-induced anxiety dis-order is included in Chapter 27). Also included in thischapter is a discussion of gambling disorder, a non-substance addiction disorder. Drugs are a pervasive part of our society. Certain mood-altering substances are quite socially acceptableand are used moderately by many adult Americans.They include alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine. Societyhas even developed a relative indifference to an occasional abuse of these substances, despite docu-mentation of their negative impact on health. A wide variety of substances are produced for medicinal purposes. These include central nervoussystem (CNS) stimulants (e.g., asnumerous over-the-counter preparations designed torelieve nearly every kind of human ailment, real orimagined. Some illegal substances have achieved a degree of social acceptance by various subcultural groups withinour society. These drugs, such as marijuana andhashish, are by no means harmless, and the long-termeffects are still being studied. On the other hand, thedangerous effects of other illegal substances (e.g., lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD], phencyclidine, cocaine, and heroin) have been well documented. This chapter discusses the physical and behavioral manifestations and personal and social consequencesrelated to the abuse of or addiction Wide cultural variations in attitudes existregarding substance consumption and patterns ofuse. Substance abuse is especially prevalent among individuals between the ages of 18 and 24. Substance-related disorders are diagnosed more commonly inmen than in women, but the gender ratios vary withthe class of the substance. Codependency is described in this chapter, as are aspects of treatment for the disorder. The issue of sub-stance impairment within the profession of nursingis also explored. Nursing care for individuals with sub-stance use and addictive disorders is presented in thecontext of the six steps of the nursing process. Variousmedical and other treatment modalities are also discussed. Substance Use Disorder, Defined CORE CONCEPT Addiction A compulsive or chronic requirement. The need is so strong as to generate distress (either physical or psychological) if left unfulfilled. Substance Addiction The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013) lists diagnostic criteria for addiction to specific substances, including alcohol, cannabis, hal-lucinogens, inhalants, opioids, sedatives/hypnotics/anxiolytics, stimulants, and tobacco. Individuals areconsidered to have a substance use disorder when useof the substance interferes with their ability to fulfillrole obligations, such as at work, school, or home.Often the individual would like to cut down or controluse of the substance, but attempts fail, and use of thesubstance continues to increase. There is an intensecraving for the substance, and an excessive amount oftime is spent trying to procure more of the substanceor recover from the effects of its use. Use of the sub-stance causes problems with interpersonal relation-ships, and the individual may become socially isolated.Individuals with substance use disorders often partici-pate in hazardous activities when they are impaired bythe substance, and continue to use the substance de-spite knowing that its use is contributing to a physicalor psychological problem. Addiction is evident whentolerance develops and the amount required toachieve the desired effect continues to increase. A syn-drome of symptoms, characteristic of the specific sub-stance, o ccurs when the individual with the addiction attempts to discontinue use of the substance. Substance-Induced Disorder, Defined CORE CONCEPT Intoxication A physical and mental state of exhilaration and emo- tional frenzy or lethargy and stupor. Substance Intoxication Substance intoxication is defined as the development of a reversible syndrome of symptoms following excessive use of a substance. The symptoms are drug-specific, and occur during or shortly after the 4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 366ingestion of the substance. There is a direct effect on the CNS, and a disruption in physical and psycholog-ical functioning occurs. Judgment is disturbed, result-ing in inappropriate and maladaptive behavior, andsocial and occupational functioning are impaired.Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 2011).Studies with monozygotic and dizygotic twins have alsosupported the genetic hypothesis. Monozygotic (oneegg, genetically identical) twins have a higher rate forconcordance of alcoholism than dizygotic (two eggs, genetically nonidentical) twins (Black & Andreasen,2011). Other studies have shown that biological off-spring of alcoholic parents have a significantly greaterincidence of alcoholism than offspring of nonalcoholicparents. This is true whether the child was reared by thebiological parents or by nonalcoholic adoptive parents(Puri & Treasaden, 2011). Biochemical A second biological hypothesis relates to the possibilitythat alcohol may produce morphine-like substances inthe brain that are responsible for alcohol addiction.These substances are formed by the reaction of biolog-ically active amines (e.g., dopamine, serotonin) withproducts of alcohol metabolism, such as acetaldehyde(Jamal et al., 2003). Examples of these morphine-likesubstances include tetrahydropapaveroline and salsoli-nol. Some tests with animals have shown that injectionof these compounds into the brain in small amountsresults in patterns of alcohol addiction in animals whohad previously avoided even the most dilute alcohol solutions (McCoy, Strawbridge, McMurtrey, Kane, &Ward, 2003). Psychological Factors Developmental Influences The psychodynamic approach to the etiology of sub-stance abuse focuses on a punitive superego and fix-ation at the oral stage of psychosexual development(Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Individuals with punitivesuperegos turn to alcohol to diminish unconsciousanxiety and increase feelings of power and self-worth.Sadock and Sadock (2007) state, \"As a form of self-medication, alcohol may be used to control panic,opioids to diminish anger, and amphetamines to alleviate depression\" (p. 386). Personality Factors Certain personality traits have been associated withan increased tendency toward addictive behavior.Some clinicians believe a low self-esteem, frequent de-pression, passivity, the inability to relax or to defergratification, and the inability to communicate effec-tively are common in individuals who abuse sub-stances. These personality characteristics cannot becalled predictive of addictive behavior, yet for reasons not completely understood, they have been found toaccompany addiction in many instances. Substance abuse has also been associated with an- tisocial personality and depressive response styles.CHAPTER 23 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 367 CORE CONCEPT Withdrawal The physiological and mental readjustment that accom- panies the discontinuation of an addictive substance. Substance Withdrawal Substance withdrawal occurs upon abrupt reduction or discontinuation of a substance that has been usedregularly over a prolonged period of time. The sub-stance-specific syndrome includes clinically significantphysical signs and symptoms as well as psychologicalchanges such as disturbances in thinking, feeling, andbehavior. Classes of Psychoactive Substances The following classes of psychoactive substances areassociated number of factors have been implicated in the predisposition to abuse of substances. At present,there is no single theory that can adequately explainthe etiology of this problem. No doubt the interactionbetween various elements forms a complex collectionof determinants that influence a person's susceptibil-ity to abuse substances. Biological Factors Genetics An apparent hereditary factor is involved in the devel-opment of substance use disorders. This is especially ev-ident with alcoholism, but less so with other substances.Children of alcoholics are four times more likely thanother children to become alcoholics (American 4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 367This may be explained by the inability of the individ- ual with antisocial personality to anticipate the aver-sive consequences of his or her behavior. It is likelyan effort on the part of the depressed person to treatthe symptoms of discomfort associated with dyspho-ria. Achievement of relief then provides the positivereinforcement to continue abusing the substance. Sociocultural Factors Social Learning The effects of modeling, imitation, and identificationon behavior can be observed from early childhoodonward. In relation to drug consumption, the familyappears to be an important influence. Various studieshave shown that children and adolescents are morelikely to use substances if they have parents who pro-vide a model for substance use. Peers often exert agreat deal of influence in the life of the child or ado-lescent who is being encouraged to use substances forthe first time. Modeling may continue to be a factorin the use of substances once the individual enters theworkforce, particularly if the work setting providesplenty of leisure time with coworkers and drinking isvalued as a way to express group cohesiveness. Conditioning Another important learning factor is the effect of thesubstance itself. Many substances create a pleasurableexperience that encourages the user to repeat it.Thus, it is the intrinsically reinforcing properties ofaddictive drugs that \"condition\" the individual to seekout their use again and again. The environment inwhich the substance is taken also contributes to thereinforcement. If the environment is pleasurable, sub-stance use is usually increased. Aversive stimuli withinan environment are thought to be associated with adecrease in substance use within that environment. Cultural and Ethnic Influences Factors within an individual's culture help to establishpatterns of substance use by molding attitudes, influ-encing patterns of consumption based on cultural ac-ceptance, and determining the availability of thesubstance. For centuries, the French and Italians haveconsidered wine an essential part of the family meal,even for the children. The incidence of alcohol ad-diction is low, and acute intoxication from alcohol isnot common. However, the possibility of chronicphysiological effects associated with lifelong alcoholconsumption cannot be ignored. Historically, a high incidence of alcohol addiction has existed within the Native American culture. Alcohol-related deaths among Native Americans are more thanthree times that of the U.S. general population (IndianHealth Service, 2011). Veterans Administration recordsshow that 45 percent of Native American veterans are addicted to alcohol, a rate two times that of non-Native American veterans. A number of reasonshave been postulated for alcohol abuse among NativeAmericans: a possible physical cause (difficulty metab-olizing alcohol), children modeling their parents'drinking habits, unemployment and poverty, and lossof the traditional Native American religion that somebelieve has led to the increased use of alcohol to fill thespiritual gap. The incidence of alcohol addiction is higher among northern Europeans than southern Europeans. TheFinns and the Irish use excessive alcohol consumptionfor the release of aggression, and the English and Irish\"pubs\" are known for their attraction as social meetingplaces (Ehrlander, 2007; Schim, 2013). Incidence of alcohol addiction among Asians is rel- atively low. This may be a result of a possible geneticintolerance of the substance. Some Asians develop unpleasant symptoms, such as flushing, headaches,nausea, and palpitations, when they drink alcohol. Re-search indicates that this is because of an isoenzymevariant that quickly converts alcohol to acetaldehyde,as well as the absence of an isoenzyme that is neededto oxidize acetaldehyde. This results in a rapid accu-mulation of acetaldehyde, which produces the unpleas-ant symptoms (Hanley, 2013). The Dynamics of Substance-Related Disorders Alcohol Use Disorder A Profile of the Substance Alcohol is a natural substance formed by the reactionof fermenting sugar with yeast spores. Although thereare many alcohols, the kind in alcoholic beverages isknown scientifically as ethyl alcohol and chemicallyas C 2H5OH. Its abbreviation, ETOH, is sometimes seen in medical records and in various other docu-ments and publications. By strict definition, alcohol is classified as a food because it contains calories; however, it has no nutri-tional value. Different alcoholic beverages are pro-duced by using different sources of sugar for thefermentation process. For example, beer is madefrom malted barley, wine from grapes or berries,whiskey from malted grains, and rum from molasses.Distilled beverages (e.g., whiskey, scotch, gin, vodka,and other \"hard\" liquors) derive their name from fur-ther concentration of the alcohol through a processcalled distillation. The alcohol content varies by type of beverage. For example, most American beers contain 3 to 6 percentalcohol, wines average 10 to 20 percent, and distilledbeverages range from 40 to 50 percent alcohol. The368 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 368average-sized drink, regardless of beverage, contains a similar amount of alcohol. That is, 12 ounces of beer, 3 to 5 ounces of wine, and a cocktail with 1 ounce of whiskey all contain approximately 0.5 ounceof alcohol. If consumed at the same rate, they all wouldhave an equal effect on the body. Alcohol exerts a depressant effect on the CNS, re- sulting in behavioral and mood changes. The effectsof alcohol on the CNS are proportional to the alco-holic concentration in the blood. Most states considerthat an individual is legally intoxicated with a bloodalcohol level of 0.08 percent. The body burns alcohol at the rate of about 0.5 ounce per hour, so behavioral changes would notbe expected to occur in an individual who slowly con-sumed only one averaged-sized drink per hour. Otherfactors do influence these effects, however, such as in-dividual size and whether or not the stomach containsfood at the time the alcohol is consumed. Alcohol isalso thought to have a more profound effect when anindividual is emotionally stressed or fatigued. Historical Aspects The use of alcohol can be traced back to the Neolithicage. Beer and wine are known to have been usedaround 6400 BC. With the introduction of distillation by the Arabs in the Middle Ages, alchemists believedthat alcohol was the answer to all of their ailments.The word whiskey , meaning \"water of life,\" became widely known. In America, Native Americans had been drinking beer and wine prior to the arrival of the first white im-migrants. Refinement of the distillation process madebeverages with high alcohol content readily available.By the early 1800s, one renowned physician of thetime, Benjamin Rush, had begun to identify the wide-spread excessive, chronic alcohol consumption as a dis-ease and an addiction. The strong religious mores onwhich this country was founded soon led to a drivingforce aimed at prohibiting the sale of alcoholic bever-ages. By the middle of the 19th century, 13 states hadpassed prohibition laws. The most notable prohibitionof major proportions was that in effect in the UnitedStates from 1920 to 1933. The mandatory restrictionson national social habits resulted in the creation ofprofitable underground markets that led to flourishingcriminal enterprises. Furthermore, millions of dollarsin federal, state, and local revenues from taxes and im-port duties on alcohol were lost. It is difficult to meas-ure the value of this dollar loss against the humandevastation and social costs that occur as a result of alcohol abuse in the United States today. Patterns of Use About half of Americans aged 12 years and older re-port being current drinkers of alcohol (SubstanceAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration[SAMHSA], 2013). Of these, approximately 23 per-cent report participating in binge drinking, and 6.5 percent engage in heavy alcohol use. Why do people drink? Drinking patterns in the United States show that people use alcoholic bever-ages to enhance the flavor of food with meals; at socialgatherings to encourage relaxation and convivialityamong the guests; and to promote a feeling of cele-bration at special occasions such as weddings, birth-days, and anniversaries. An alcoholic beverage (wine)is also used as part of the sacred ritual in some reli-gious ceremonies. Therapeutically, alcohol is themajor ingredient in many over-the-counter and pre-scription medicines that are prepared in concen-trated form. Therefore, alcohol can be harmless andenjoyable\u2014sometimes even beneficial\u2014if it is usedresponsibly and in moderation. Like any other mind-altering drug, however, alcohol has the potential forabuse. Indeed, it is the most widely abused drug inthe United States today. Alcoholism is the nation'snumber one health problem and the third leadinglifestyle-related cause of death in the United States(National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Depend-ence, 2013). Thousands of Americans die each yearas a result of alcohol use, and it is a factor in morethan half of all homicides, suicides, and traffic acci-dents. Incidents of domestic violence are commonlyalcohol-related. Heavy drinking contributes to illnessin each of the top three causes of death: heart disease,cancer, and stroke. Fetal alcohol syndrome is the mostcommon preventable cause of intellectual disability in the United States (Walton-Moss, Becker, Kub, &Woodruff, 2010). Jellinek (1952) outlined four phases through which the alcoholic's pattern of drinking progresses. Somevariability among individuals is to be expected withinthis model of progression. Phase I: The Prealcoholic Phase This phase is characterized by the use of alcohol to re-lieve the everyday stress and tensions of life. As a child,the individual may have observed parents or otheradults drinking alcohol and enjoying the effects. Thechild learns that use of alcohol is an acceptablemethod of coping with stress. Tolerance develops, andthe amount required to achieve the desired effect increases steadily. Phase II: The Early Alcoholic Phase This phase begins with blackouts\u2014brief periods ofamnesia that occur during or immediately followinga period of drinking. Now the alcohol is no longer asource of pleasure or relief for the individual butrather a drug that is required by the individual. Com- mon behaviors include sneaking drinks or secretCHAPTER 23 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 3694092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 369drinking, preoccupation with drinking and maintain- ing the supply of alcohol, rapid gulping of drinks, andfurther blackouts. The individual feels enormousguilt and becomes very defensive about his or herdrinking. Excessive use of denial and rationalizationis evident. Phase III: The Crucial Phase In this phase, the individual has lost control, andphysiological addiction is clearly evident. This loss ofcontrol has been described as the inability to choosewhether or not to drink. Binge drinking, lasting froma few hours to several weeks, is common. Theseepisodes are characterized by sickness, loss of con-sciousness, squalor, and degradation. In this phase,the individual is extremely ill. Anger and aggressionare common manifestations. Drinking is the totalfocus, and he or she is willing to risk losing everythingthat was once important, in an effort to maintain theaddiction. By this phase of the illness, it is not uncom-mon for the individual to have experienced the lossof job, marriage, family, friends, and most especially,self-respect. Phase IV: The Chronic Phase This phase is characterized by emotional and physicaldisintegration. The individual is usually intoxicatedmore than he or she is sober. Emotional disintegra-tion is evidenced by profound helplessness and self-pity. Impairment in reality testing may result inpsychosis. Life-threatening physical manifestationsmay be evident in virtually every system of the body.Abstention from alcohol results in a terrifying syn-drome of symptoms that include hallucinations,tremors, convulsions, severe agitation, and panic. De-pression and ideas of suicide are not uncommon. Effects on the Body Alcohol can induce a general, nonselective, reversibledepression of the CNS. About 20 percent of a singledose of alcohol is absorbed directly and immediatelyinto the bloodstream through the stomach wall. Un-like other \"foods,\" it does not have to be digested.The blood carries it directly to the brain where the alcohol acts on the brain's central control areas, slow-ing down or depressing brain activity. The other 80 percent of the alcohol in one drink is processedonly slightly slower through the upper intestinal tractand into the bloodstream. Only moments after alco-hol is consumed, it can be found in all tissues, organs,and secretions of the body. Rapidity of absorption isinfluenced by various factors. For example, absorp-tion is delayed when the drink is sipped, rather thangulped; when the stomach contains food, rather thanbeing empty; and when the drink is wine or beer,rather than distilled beverages.370 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation At low doses, alcohol produces relaxation, loss of inhibitions, lack of concentration, drowsiness, slurredspeech, and sleep. Chronic abuse results in multisys-tem physiological impairments. These complicationsinclude (but are not limited to) those outlined in thefollowing sections. Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy, characterized by peripheralnerve damage, results in pain, burning, tingling, orprickly sensations of the extremities. Researchers believeit is the direct result of deficiencies in the B vitamins,particularly thiamine. Nutritional deficiencies are com-mon in chronic alcoholics because of insufficient intakeof nutrients as well as the toxic effect of alcohol that results in malabsorption of nutrients. The process is reversible with abstinence from alcohol and restorationof nutritional deficiencies. Otherwise, permanent mus-cle wasting and paralysis can occur. Alcoholic Myopathy Alcoholic myopathy may occur as an acute or chroniccondition. In the acute condition, the individual ex-periences a sudden onset of muscle pain, swelling, andweakness; a reddish tinge in the urine caused by myo-globin, a breakdown product of muscle excreted inthe urine; and a rapid rise in muscle enzymes in theblood (Klopstock, Haller, & DiMauro, 2012). Musclesymptoms are usually generalized, but pain andswelling may selectively involve the calves or othermuscle groups. Laboratory studies show elevations symptoms of chronic alcoholicmyopathy include a gradual wasting and weakness inskeletal muscles. Neither the pain and tenderness northe elevated muscle enzymes seen in acute myopathyare evident in the chronic condition. Alcoholic myopathy is thought to be a result of the same B vitamin deficiency that contributes to periph-eral neuropathy. Improvement is observed with absti-nence from alcohol and the return to a nutritious dietwith vitamin supplements. Wernicke's Encephalopathy Wernicke's encephalopathy represents the most serious form of thiamine deficiency in alcoholics.Symptoms include paralysis of the ocular muscles,diplopia, ataxia, somnolence, and stupor. If thiaminereplacement undertaken quickly, deathwill ensue. Korsakoff's Psychosis Korsakoff's psychosis is identified by a syndrome of confusion, loss of recent memory, and confabulationin alcoholics. It is frequently encountered in clientsrecovering from Wernicke's encephalopathy. In the4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM States, the two disorders are usually consid- ered together and are called Wernicke-Korsakoff syn- drome. Treatment is with parenteral or oral thiamine replacement. Alcoholic Cardiomyopathy The effect of alcohol on the heart is an accumulationof lipids in the myocardial cells, resulting in enlarge-ment and a weakened condition. The clinical findingsof alcoholic cardiomyopathy generally relate to con-gestive heart failure or arrhythmia. Symptoms includedecreased exercise tolerance, tachycardia, dyspnea,edema, palpitations, and nonproductive cough. Lab-oratory studies may show elevation of the enzymesCPK, AST, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and LDH.Changes may be observed by electrocardiogram, andcongestive heart failure may be evident on chest x-rayfilms (Bashore, Granger, Hranitzky, & Patel, 2012). The treatment is total permanent abstinence from alcohol. Treatment of the congestive heart failuremay include rest, oxygen, digitalization, sodium re-striction, and diuretics. Prognosis is encouraging iftreated in the early stages. The death rate is high forindividuals with advanced symptomatology. Esophagitis Esophagitis\u2014inflammation and pain in the esophagus\u2014occurs because of the toxic effects of alcohol on theesophageal mucosa. It also occurs because of frequentvomiting associated with alcohol abuse. Gastritis The effects of alcohol on the stomach include inflam-mation of the stomach lining characterized by epigas-tric distress, nausea, vomiting, and distention. Alcoholbreaks down the stomach's protective mucosal barrier,allowing hydrochloric acid to erode the stomach wall.Damage to blood vessels may result in hemorrhage. Pancreatitis Pancreatitis may be categorized as acute or chronic. Acute pancreatitis usually occurs 1 or 2 days after abinge of excessive alcohol consumption. Symptomsinclude constant, severe epigastric pain, nausea andvomiting, and abdominal distention. The chroniccondition leads to pancreatic insufficiency resultingin steatorrhea, malnutrition, weight loss, and diabetesmellitus. Alcoholic Hepatitis Alcoholic hepatitis is inflammation of the liver causedby long-term heavy alcohol use. Clinical manifesta-tions include an enlarged and tender liver, nauseaand vomiting, lethargy, anorexia, elevated whiteblood cell count, fever, and jaundice. Ascites and weight loss may be evident in more severe cases. Withtreatment\u2014which includes strict abstinence from alcohol, proper nutrition, and rest\u2014the individualcan experience complete recovery. Severe cases canlead to hepatic encephalopathy . Cirrhosis of the Liver Cirrhosis of the liver may be caused by anything thatresults in chronic injury to the liver. It is the end-stageof alcoholic liver disease and results from long-termchronic alcohol abuse. There is widespread destruc-tion of liver cells, which are replaced by fibrous (scar)tissue. Clinical manifestations include nausea andvomiting, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, jaun-dice, edema, anemia, and blood coagulation abnor-malities. Treatment includes abstention from alcohol,correction of malnutrition, and supportive care toprevent complications of the disease. Complicationsof cirrhosis include the following: Portal Hypertension. Elevation of blood pressure through the portal circulation results from defec-tive blood flow through the cirrhotic liver. Ascites. Ascites, a condition in which an excessive amount of serous fluid accumulates in the abdom-inal cavity, occurs in response to portal hyperten-sion. The increased pressure results in the seepageof fluid from the surface of the liver into the abdominal cavity. Esophageal Varices. Esophageal varices are veins in the esophagus that become distended because of ex-cessive pressure from defective blood flow throughthe cirrhotic liver. As this pressure increases, thesevaricosities can rupture, resulting in hemorrhageand sometimes death. Hepatic Encephalopathy. This serious complication occurs in response to the inability of the diseased liverto convert ammonia to urea for excretion. The con-tinued rise in serum ammonia results in progressivelyimpaired mental functioning, apathy, euphoria or de-pression, sleep disturbance, increasing confusion,and progression to coma and eventual death. Treat-ment requires complete abstention from alcohol,temporary elimination of protein from the diet, andreduction of intestinal ammonia using neomycin orlactulose (National Library of Medicine, 2011). Leukopenia The production, function, and movement of thewhite blood cells are impaired in chronic alcoholics.This condition, called leukopenia, places the individ-ual at high risk for contracting infectious diseases aswell as for complicated recovery. Thrombocytopenia Platelet production and survival is impaired as a resultof the toxic effects of alcohol. This places the alco-holic at risk for hemorrhage. Abstinence from alcoholrapidly reverses this deficiency.CHAPTER 23 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 3714092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 371Sexual Dysfunction Alcohol interferes with the normal production and maintenance of female and male hormones (Sadock& Sadock, 2007). For women, this can mean changesin the menstrual cycles and a decreased or loss of abil-ity to become pregnant. For men, the decreased hor-mone levels result in a diminished libido, decreasedsexual performance, and impaired fertility. Use During Pregnancy Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prenatal exposure to alcohol can result in a broadrange of disorders to the fetus, known as fetal alcoholspectrum disorders (FASDs), the most common ofwhich is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Fetal alcoholsyndrome includes physical, mental, behavioral,and/or learning disabilities with lifelong implications.There may be problems with learning, memory, atten-tion span, communication, vision, hearing, or a com-bination of these (Centers for Disease Control andPrevention [CDC], 2011). Other FASDs include alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). No amount of alcohol during pregnancy is consid- ered safe, and alcohol can damage a fetus at any stageof pregnancy (Carmona, 2005). Therefore, drinking al-cohol should be avoided by women who are pregnantor by women who could become pregnant. Estimatesof the prevalence of FAS range from 0.2 to 1.5 per 1,000live births (CDC, 2012a). The rate is higher amongAfrican Americans and Native Americans (possibly ashigh as 9 per 1,000 in the latter group) (Dannaway &Mulvihill, 2009). Maier and West (2013) stated: The number of women who engage in heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy surpasses the totalnumber of children diagnosed with either FAS orARND, meaning that not every child whose motherdrank alcohol during pregnancy develops FAS orARND. Moreover, the degree to which people withFAS or ARND are impaired differs from person toperson. Several factors may contribute to this varia-tion in the consequences of maternal drinking. Thesefactors include, but are not limited to, the following: Maternal drinking pattern Differences in maternal metabolism Differences in genetic susceptibility Timing of the alcohol consumption during pregnancy Variation in the vulnerability of different brain regions Children with FAS may have the following character- istics or exhibit the following behaviors (CDC, 2011): Abnormal facial features (see Fig. 23-1) Small head size Shorter-than-average height Low body weight Poor coordinationHyperactive behavior Difficulty paying attention Poor memory Difficulty in school Learning disabilities Speech and language delays Intellectual disability or low IQ Poor reasoning and judgment skills Sleep and sucking problems as a baby Vision or hearing problems Problems with the heart, kidneys, or bones Neuroimaging of children with FAS shows abnormal- ities in the size and shape of their brains. The frontal lobes and cerebellum are often smaller than normal, andthe corpus and basal ganglia are commonly af-fected (Dannaway & Mulvihill, 2009). Studies show thatchildren with FAS are often at risk for psychiatric disor-ders, commonly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,mood disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders,reactive attachment disorder, and conduct disorder(Coles, 2011; Hoffman, 2006). Children with FAS require lifelong care and treat- ment. There is no cure for FAS, but it can be pre-vented. The Surgeon General's Advisory on AlcoholUse in Pregnancy states: Health professionals should inquire routinely about alcohol consumption by women of childbearing age,inform them of the risks of alcohol consumption dur-ing pregnancy, and advise them not to drink alcoholicbeverages during pregnancy (Carmona, 2005, p. 1). Alcohol Intoxication Symptoms of alcohol intoxication include disinhibition of sexual or aggressive impulses, mood lability, impairedjudgment, impaired social or occupational functioning,slurred speech, incoordination, unsteady gait, nystag-mus, and flushed face. Intoxication usually occurs atblood alcohol levels between 100 and 200 mg/dL.Death has been reported at levels ranging from 400 to700 mg/dL.372 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation Skin folds at the corner of the eyeLow nasal bridge Short nose Indistinct philtrum (groove between nose and upper lip)Small head circumferenceSmall eye opening Smallmidface Thin upper lip FIGURE 23-1 Facial features of FAS. (From the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health, Washington, D.C.)4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 372Alcohol Withdrawal Within 4 to 12 hours of cessation of or reduction in heavy and prolonged (several days or longer) alcoholuse, the following symptoms may appear: coarse tremorof hands, tongue, illusions; headache; and insomnia. A complicated withdrawal syndrome mayprogress to alcohol withdrawal delirium. Onset of delirium is usually on the second or third day following cessationof or reduction in prolonged, heavy alcohol use. Symp-toms include those described under the syndrome ofdelirium (Chapter 22). Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder A Profile of the Substance The sedative/hypnotic/anxiolytic compounds are drugs of diverse chemical structures that are all capa-ble of inducing varying degrees of CNS depression,from tranquilizing relief of anxiety to anesthesia,coma, and even death. They are generally categorizedas (1) barbiturates, (2) nonbarbiturate hypnotics, and(3) antianxiety agents. Effects produced by these sub-stances depend on size of dose and potency of drugadministered. Table 23-1 presents a selected list of drugs included in these categories. Generic names are followed inparentheses by the trade names. Common streetnames for each category are also included. Several principles have been identified that apply fairly uniformly to all CNS depressants: 1. The effects of CNS depressants are additive with one another and with the behavioral state of theuser.For example, when these drugs are used in combination with each other or in combination withalcohol, the depressive effects are compounded.These intense depressive effects are often unpre-dictable and can even be fatal. Similarly, a person who is mentally depressed or physically fatigued mayhave an exaggerated response to a dose of the drugCHAPTER 23 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 373 TABLE 23-1 Sedative, Hypnotic, and Anxiolytic Drugs CATEGORIES GENERIC (TRADE) NAMES COMMON STREET NAMES red R-2, rope (Rohypnol); G, liquid X, grievous bodily harm, easy lay (GHB)4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 373374 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation that would only slightly affect a person in a normal or excited state. 2. CNS depressants are capable of producing physio- logical addiction. If large doses of CNS depressants are repeatedly administered over a prolonged du-ration, a period of CNS hyperexcitability occurs onwithdrawal of the drug. The response can be quitesevere, even leading to convulsions and death. 3. CNS depressants are capable of producing psycho- logical addiction. CNS depressants have the poten- tial to generate within the individual a psychicdrive for periodic or continuous administration ofthe drug to achieve a maximum level of function-ing or feeling of well-being. 4. Cross-tolerance and cross-dependence may exist between various CNS depressants. Cross-tolerance is exhibited when one drug results in a lessenedresponse to another drug. Cross-dependence is acondition in which one drug can prevent with-drawal symptoms associated with physical addic-tion to a different drug (Julien, 2008). Historical Aspects Anxiety and insomnia, two of the most commonhuman afflictions, were treated during known to produce physicaladdiction, the bromides carried the risk of chronic bro-mide poisoning, and chloral hydrate and paraldehydehad an objectionable taste and smell, alcohol becamethe prescribed depressant drug of choice. However,some people refused to use alcohol either because theydid not like the taste or for moral reasons, and otherstended to take more than was prescribed. Therefore,a search for a better sedative drug continued. Although barbituric acid was first synthesized in 1864, it was not until 1912 that phenobarbital was in-troduced into medicine as a sedative drug, the first ofthe structurally classified group of drugs called barbi-turates (Julien, 2008). Since that time, more than2,500 barbiturate derivatives have been synthesized,but currently, fewer than a dozen remain in medicaluse. Illicit use of the drugs for recreational purposesgrew throughout the 1930s and 1940s. Efforts to create depressant medications that were not barbiturate derivatives accelerated. By the mid-1950s the market for depressants had been expandedby the appearance of the nonbarbiturates glutethimide,ethchlorvynol, and meprobamate. Intro-duction of the marketing of chlordiazepoxide (Librium), fol-lowed shortly by its derivative diazepam (Valium). Theuse of these drugs, and others within their group, grewvery rapidly, and they are prescribed widely in medicalpractice. Their margin of safety is greater than that ofbarbiturates and the other nonbarbiturates. However,prolonged use of even moderate doses is likely to resultin physical and psychological addiction, with a charac-teristic syndrome of withdrawal that can be severe. Patterns of Use Sadock and Sadock (2007) reported that about 15 percent of all persons in the United States have hada benzodiazepine prescribed by a physician. Of all the drugs used in clinical practice, the sedative/hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs are among the most widelyprescribed. Two patterns of addiction are described. The first pattern is one of an individual whose physician orig-inally prescribed the CNS depressant as treatment foranxiety or insomnia. Independently, the individualhas increased the dosage or frequency from thatwhich was prescribed. Use of the medication is justi-fied on the basis of treating symptoms, but as toler-ance grows, more and more of the medication isrequired to produce the desired effect. Substance-seeking behavior is evident as the individual seeksprescriptions from several physicians in order tomaintain sufficient supplies. The second pattern involves young people in their teens or early 20s who, in the company of their peers,use substances that were obtained illegally. The initialobjective is to achieve a feeling of euphoria. The drugis usually used intermittently during recreational gath-erings. This pattern of intermittent use leads to regularuse and extreme levels of tolerance. Combining usewith other substances is not uncommon. Physical andpsychological addiction leads to intense substance-seeking behaviors, most often through illegal channels. Effects on the Body The sedative/hypnotic/anxiolytic compounds inducea general depressant effect; that is, they depress theactivity of the brain, nerves, muscles, and heart tissue.They reduce the rate of metabolism in a variety of tis-sues throughout the body, and in general, they de-press any system that uses energy (Julien, 2008).Large doses are required to produce these effects. Inlower doses these drugs appear to be more selectivein their depressant actions by exerting their action on the centers within the brain that are concernedwith arousal (e.g., the ascending reticular activatingsystem, in the reticular formation, and the diffusethalamic projection system). As stated previously, these drugs are capable of producing all levels of CNS depression\u2014from mildsedation to death. The level is determined by dosageand potency of the drug used. In Figure 23-2, a con-tinuum of the CNS depressant effects is presented 4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 374to demonstrate how increasing doses of sedative/ hypnotic drugs affect behavioral depression. The primary action of sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics is on nervous tissue. However, large dosesmay have an effect on other organ systems. Followingis a discussion of the physiological effects of thesemedications. The Effects on Sleep and Dreaming Barbiturate use decreases the amount of sleep timespent in dreaming. During drug withdrawal, dreamingbecomes vivid and excessive. Rebound insomnia andincreased dreaming (termed REM rebound ) are not un- common with abrupt withdrawal from long-term useof these drugs as sleeping aids (Julien, 2008). Respiratory Depression Barbiturates are capable of inhibiting the reticular activating system, resulting in respiratory depression(Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Additive effects can occurwith the concurrent use of other CNS depressants, effecting a life-threatening situation. Cardiovascular Effects Hypotension may be a problem with large doses. Only a slight decrease in blood pressure is noted withnormal oral dosage. High dosages of barbiturates mayresult in decreased cardiac output, decreased cerebralblood flow, and direct impairment of myocardial con-tractility (Lafferty & Abdel-Kariem, 2012). Renal Function In doses high enough to produce anesthesia, barbi-turates may suppress urine function. At the usualsedative/hypnotic dosage, however, there is no evi-dence that they have any direct action on the kidneys. Hepatic Effects The barbiturates may produce jaundice with doseslarge enough to produce acute intoxication. Barbi-turates stimulate the production of liver enzymes, resulting in a decrease in the plasma levels of boththe barbiturates and other drugs metabolized in theliver. Preexisting liver disease may predispose an individual to additional liver damage with excessivebarbiturate use.Body Temperature High doses of barbiturates can greatly decrease body temperature. It is not significantly altered withnormal dosage levels. Sexual Functioning CNS depressants have a tendency to produce a bipha-sic response. There is an initial increase in libido, pre-sumably from the primary disinhibitory effects of the drug. This initial response is then followed by adecrease in the ability to maintain an erection. Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication The DSM-5 (APA, 2013) describes sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication as the presence of clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or psychologicalchanges that develop during, or shortly after, use ofone of these substances. These maladaptive changesmay include inappropriate sexual or aggressive behav-ior, mood lability, impaired judgment, or impaired social or occupational functioning. Other symptomsthat may develop with excessive use of CNS depres-sants include slurred speech, incoordination, un-steady gait, ormemory, and stupor or coma. \"Club drugs\" in this gamma hydrox- ybutyric acid (GHB) and flunitrazepam (Rohypnol).Like all of the depressants, they can produce a state ofdisinhibition, excitement, drunkenness, and amnesia.They have been widely implicated as \"date rape\" drugs,their presence being easily disguised in drinks. They pro-duce anterograde amnesia, rendering the inability to re-member events experienced while under their influence(Walton-Moss et al., 2010) . Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal Withdrawal from sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics produces a characteristic syndrome of symptoms thatdevelops after a marked decrease in or cessation ofintake that has been heavy or prolonged (APA, 2013).Onset of the symptoms depends on the drug fromCHAPTER 23 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 375 FIGURE 23-2 Continuum of behavioral depression with increasing doses of sedative-hypnotic drugs.4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 375which short-acting anxiolytics (e.g., alprazolam, lorazepam), symptomsmay begin between 12 and 24 hours after the lastdose, reach peak intensity between 24 and 72 hours, and subside in 5 to 10 days. Withdrawalsymptoms from substances with longer half-lives (e.g.,diazepam, phenobarbital, chlordiazepoxide) maybegin within 2 to 7 days, peak on the 5th to 8th day,and subside in 10 to 16 days (Gualtieri, 2004; Leamon,Wright, & Myrick, 2008). Severe withdrawal is most likely to occur when a substance has been used at high dosages for pro-longed periods. However, withdrawal symptoms alsohave been reported with moderate dosages taken overa relatively short duration. Withdrawal symptoms associated with sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics in-clude autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., sweating or pulserate greater than 100), increased hand tremor, insom-nia, nausea or vomiting, hallucinations, illusions, psy-chomotor agitation, anxiety, or grand mal seizures. Stimulant Use Disorder A Profile of the Substance The CNS stimulants are identified by the behavioralstimulation and psychomotor agitation that they in-duce. They differ widely in their molecular structuresand in their mechanisms of action. The amount ofCNS stimulation caused by a certain drug depends onboth the area in the brain or spinal cord that is af-fected by the drug and the cellular mechanism fun-damental to the increased excitability. The DSM-5 (APA, 2013) categorizes caffeine-related disordersand tobacco-related disorders as separate and distinctdiagnoses. For purposes of this text, these substanceswill be discussed with the stimulant-related disorders. Groups within this category are classified according to similarities in mechanism of action. The psychomotor stimulants induce stimulation by augmentation or potentiation of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine,epinephrine, or dopamine. The general cellular stimu- lants (caffeine and nicotine) exert their action directly on cellular activity. Caffeine inhibits the enzyme phos-phodiesterase, allowing increased levels of 3', 5'-cyclicadenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a chemical sub-stance that metab-olism. synapses. Thisresults in impulse transmission to the entire autonomicnervous system. A selected list of drugs included inthese categories is presented in Table 23-2. The two most prevalent and widely used stimulants are caffeine and nicotine. Caffeine is readily availablein every supermarket and grocery store as a commoningredient in coffee, tea, colas, and chocolate.

When used in moderation, these stimulantstend to relieve fatigue and increase alertness. They area generally accepted part of our culture; however, withincreased social awareness regarding the health risksassociated with tobacco products, their use has becomestigmatized in some circles. The more potent stimulants, because of their poten- tial for physiological addiction, are under regulation bythe Controlled Substances Act. These controlled stimu-lants are available for therapeutic purposes by prescrip-tion only; however, they are also clandestinelymanufactured and widely distributed on the illicit mar-ket. Most recently, the synthetic stimulants mephedrone,3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), methylone,and others, have become available. Known as \"bathsalts,\" their street names include blue silk, cloud 9, ivorywave, vanilla sky, white knight, stardust, and purple wave.In October 2011, the United States Drug EnforcementAdministration (DEA) issued emergency scheduling ofthese substances to make their possession and sales ille-gal (except as authorized by law). They are currentlydesignated as Schedule I substances, the most restrictivecategory under the Controlled Substances Act. This action was taken in response to reports of episodes of violent behavior associated with use of the substances. Historical Aspects Cocaine is the most potent stimulant derived from na-ture. It is extracted from the leaves of the coca plant,which has been cultivated in the Andean highlandsof South America since prehistoric times. Natives ofthe region chew the leaves of the plant for refresh-ment and relief from fatigue. The coca leaves must be mixed with lime to release the cocaine alkaloid. The chemical formula for thepure form of the drug was developed in 1960. Physi-cians began using the drug as an anesthetic in eye,nose, and throat surgeries. It has also been used ther-apeutically in the United States in a morphine-cocaineelixir designed to relieve the suffering associated with terminal illness. These therapeutic uses are nowobsolete. Cocaine has achieved a degree of acceptability within some social circles. It is illicitly distributed as a white crys-talline powder, often mixed with other ingredients to in-crease its volume and, therefore, create more profits.The drug is most commonly \"snorted,\" and chronicusers may manifest symptoms that resemble the con-gested nose of a common cold. The intensely pleasura-ble effects of the drug create the potential forextraordinary psychological addiction. Another form of cocaine commonly used in the United States is made by processing powdered co-caine with ammonia or sodium bicarbonate andwater, and heating it to remove the hydrochloride(Street Drugs , 2012). The term \"crack,\" which is the street name for this form of the drug, refers to thecrackling sound heard when the mixture is smoked.Because this type of cocaine can be easily vaporizedand inhaled, its effects have an extremely rapid onset. Amphetamine was first prepared in 1887. Various derivatives of the drug soon followed, and clinical useof the drug began in 1927. Amphetamines were usedquite extensively for medical purposes through the1960s, but recognition of their abuse potential hassharply decreased clinical use. Today, they are pre-scribed only to treat narcolepsy (a rare disorder re-sulting in an uncontrollable desire for sleep), to treathyperactivity disorders in children, and in certaincases of obesity. Clandestine production of ampheta-mines for distribution on the illicit market has be-come a thriving business. U.S. government estimatesreport the economic cost to society of methampheta-mine use at between $16.2 billion and $48.3 billion(Office of National Drug Control Policy [ONDCP],2010). Most of these expenses are related to the costs\"that addiction places on dependent users and theirpremature mortality and from crime and criminal jus-tice costs\" (ONDCP, p. 1). Methamphetamine can besmoked, snorted, injected, or taken orally. The effectsinclude an intense rush from smoking or intravenousinjection to a slower onset of euphoria as a result ofsnorting or oral ingestion. Another form of the drug,crystal methamphetamine, is produced by slowly recrys-tallizing powder methamphetamine from a solvent suchas methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetone ( Street Drugs , 2012). It is a colorless, odorless, large-crystal form of d-methamphetamine, and is commonly called glass or ice because of its appearance. Crystal meth is usuallysmoked in a glass pipe like crack cocaine. The earliest history of caffeine is unknown and is shrouded by legend and myth. Caffeine was first dis-covered in coffee in 1820 and in tea 7 years later. Bothbeverages have been widely accepted and enjoyed asa \"pick-me-up\" by many cultures. Tobacco was used by the aborigines from remote times. Introduced in Europe in the mid-16th century,its use grew rapidly and soon became prevalent in theOrient. Tobacco came to America with the settlementof the earliest colonies. Today, it is grown in manycountries of the world, and although smoking is de-creasing in most industrialized nations, it continuesto be a serious problem in developing areas. Patterns of Use Because of their pleasurable effects, CNS stimulantshave a high abuse potential. In 2012, about 1.6 millionAmericans were current cocaine users (SAMHSA,2013). Use was highest among Americans ages 18 to 34.CHAPTER 23 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 3774092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 377Many individuals who abuse or are addicted to CNS stimulants began using the substance for the appetite-suppressant effect in an attempt at weightcontrol. Higher and higher doses are consumed in aneffort to maintain the pleasurable effects. With con-tinued use, the pleasurable effects diminish, andthere is a corresponding increase in dysphoric effects.There is a persistent craving for the substance, how-ever, even in the face of unpleasant adverse effectsfrom the continued drug taking. CNS stimulant use is usually characterized by either episodic or chronic daily, or almost daily, use.Individuals who use the substances on an episodicbasis often \"binge\" on the drug with very high dosagesfollowed by a day or two of recuperation. This recu-peration period is characterized by extremely intenseand unpleasant symptoms (called a \"crash\"). The daily user may take large or small doses and may use the drug several times a day or only at a specific time during the day. The amount consumedusually increases over time as tolerance develops.Chronic users tend to rely on CNS stimulants to feelmore powerful, more confident, and more decisive.They often fall into a pattern of taking \"uppers\" in themorning and \"downers,\" such as alcohol or sleepingpills, at night. The average American consumes two cups of coffee (about 200 mg of caffeine) per day. Caffeine isconsumed in various amounts by about 90 percent ofthe population. At a level of 500 to 600 mg of dailycaffeine consumption, symptoms of anxiety, insom-nia, and depression are not uncommon. It is also atthis level that caffeine dependence and withdrawalcan occur. Caffeine consumption is prevalent amongchildren as well as adults. Table 23-3 lists some com-mon sources of caffeine. Next to caffeine, nicotine, an active ingredient in tobacco, is the most widely used psychoactive sub-stance in U.S. society. Of the U.S. population aged 12 years or older, 26.7 percent reported current useof a tobacco product in 2012 (SAMHSA, 2013). Since1964, when the results of the first public health reporton smoking were issued, the percentage of total smok-ers has been on the decline. However, the percentageof women and teenage smokers has declined moreslowly than that of adult men. The CDC (2012b) reports that an estimated 443,000 people die annuallybecause of tobacco use or exposure to secondhandsmoke, and more than $96 billion a year of the directhealth-care costs in the United States go to treat tobacco-related illnesses. Effects on the Body The CNS stimulants are a group of pharmacologicalagents that are capable of exciting the entire nervoussystem. This is accomplished by increasing the activityor augmenting the capability of the neurotransmitteragents known to be directly involved in bodily activa-tion and behavioral stimulation. Physiological re-sponses vary markedly according to the potency anddosage of the drug. Central Nervous System Effects Stimulation of the CNS results in tremor, restlessness,anorexia, insomnia, agitation, and increased motoractivity. Amphetamines, nonamphetamine stimulants,and cocaine produce increased alertness, decrease infatigue, elation and euphoria, and subjective feelings378 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation TABLE 23-3 Common Sources of Caffeine SOURCE CAFFEINE CONTENT (mg) FOOD AND BEVERAGES 5-6 oz. brewed coffee 5-6 o z . instant coffee 5-6 oz. decaffeinated coffee5-6 oz. brewed tea5-6 oz. instant tea8 oz. green tea8-12 oz. cola drinks12 oz.

Chronic use of these drugs may result in compulsive behavior,paranoia, hallucinations, and aggressive behavior(Street Drugs, 2012). Cardiovascular/Pulmonary Effects Amphetamines can induce increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, increased heart rate, and cardiac arrhythmias ( Street Drugs , 2012). These drugs also relax bronchial smooth muscle. Cocaine intoxication typically produces a rise in my- ocardial demand for oxygen and an increase in heartrate. Severe vasoconstriction may occur and can resultin myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, andsudden death. pulmonaryhemorrhage, chronic bronchiolitis, and pneumonia.Nasal rhinitis is a result of chronic cocaine snorting. Caffeine ingestion can result in increased heart rate, palpitations, extrasystoles, and cardiac arrhyth-mias. Caffeine induces dilation of pulmonary andgeneral systemic blood vessels and constriction ofcerebral blood vessels. Nicotine stimulates the sympathetic nervous sys- tem, resulting in an increase in heart rate, blood pres-sure, and cardiac contractility, thereby increasingmyocardial oxygen consumption and demand forblood flow. Contractions of gastric smooth muscle associated with hunger are inhibited, thereby produc-ing a mild anorectic effect. Gastrointestinal and Renal Effects Gastrointestinal (GI) effects of amphetamines aresomewhat unpredictable; however, a decrease in GI tract motility commonly results in constipation.Contraction of the bladder sphincter makes urinationdifficult. Caffeine exerts hormone, reducing ofurine. Because nicotine increases the tone and activityof the bowel, it may occasionally cause diarrhea. Most CNS stimulants induce a small rise in metabolic rate and various degrees of anorexia. Amphetaminesand cocaine can cause a rise in body temperature. Sexual Functioning CNS stimulants appear to promote the coital urge in both men and women. Women, more than men,report that stimulants make them feel sexier and havemore orgasms. In fact, some men may experience sexual dysfunction with the use of stimulants. For themajority of individuals, however, these drugs exert apowerful aphrodisiac effect. Stimulant Intoxication Stimulant intoxication produces maladaptive behav-ioral and psychological changes that develop during,or shortly after, use of these drugs. Amphetamine andcocaine intoxication typically produces euphoria or af-fective blunting; changes in sociability; hypervigilance;interpersonal sensitivity; anxiety, tension, or Physicaleffects include tachycardia or bradycardia, pupillary di-lation, elevated or lowered blood pressure, perspirationor chills, nausea or vomiting, weight loss, psychomotoragitation or retardation, muscular weakness, respiratorydepression, chest pain, cardiac arrhythmias, confusion,seizures, dyskinesias, dystonias, or coma (APA, 2013). Intoxication from caffeine usually occurs following consumption in excess of 250 mg. Symptoms includerestlessness, nervousness, excitement, insomnia, flushedface, diuresis, GI disturbance, muscle twitching, ram-bling flow of thought and speech, tachycardia or cardiacarrhythmia, periods of inexhaustibility, and psychomo-tor agitation (APA, 2013). Stimulant Withdrawal Stimulant withdrawal is the presence of a characteris-tic withdrawal syndrome that develops within a fewhours to several days after cessation of, or reductionin, heavy and prolonged use (APA, 2013). Black andAndreasen (2011) state: Cessation or reduction of amphetamine (or cocaine) use may lead to a withdrawal syndrome often referredto as a \"crash.\" Symptoms include fatigue and depres-sion, nightmares, headache, profuse sweating, musclecramps, and hunger. Withdrawal symptoms usuallypeak in 2-4 days. Intense dysphoria can occur, peak-ing between 48 and 72 hours after the last dose of thestimulant. (p. 274) The DSM-5 (APA, 2013) states that a withdrawal syndrome can occur with abrupt cessation of caffeine intake after a prolonged daily use of the substance. Thesymptoms begin within 24 hours after last consumptionand may include the following symptoms: headache, irritability, difficultyconcentrating, flu-like vomiting,and/or pain and stiffness. Withdrawal from nicotine results in dysphoric or and increased appetite orweight gain (APA, 2013). A mild syndrome of nicotinewithdrawal can appear when a smoker switches fromregular cigarettes to low-nicotine cigarettes (Sadock& Sadock, 2007). Inhalant Use Disorder A Profile of the Substance Inhalant disorders are induced by inhaling the aliphaticand aromatic hydrocarbons found in substances suchas fuels, solvents, adhesives, 11:04 AM Page 379Specific examples of these substances include gasoline, varnish remover, lighter fluid, airplane glue, rubber cement, cleaning fluid, spray paint, shoe con-ditioner, and typewriter correction fluid. Patterns of Use Inhalant substances are readily available, legal, andinexpensive. These three factors make inhalants thedrug of choice among poor people and among chil-dren and young adults. Highest usage is by youthsages 12 to 17. By age 18, the usage drops dramatically.A national government survey of drug use indicatedthat 8.1 percent of people in the United States ages12 years or older acknowledged having used inhalants(SAMHSA, 2013). Methods of use include \"huffing\"\u2014a procedure in which a rag soaked with the substance is applied tothe mouth and nose and the vapors breathed in. An-other common method is called \"bagging,\" in whichthe substance is placed in a paper or plastic bag andinhaled from the bag by the user. The substance mayalso be inhaled directly from the container or sprayedin the mouth or nose. Sadock and Sadock (2007) reported that: Inhalant use among adolescents may be most com- mon in those whose parents or older siblings use ille-gal substances. Inhalant use among adolescents is alsoassociated with an increased likelihood of conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder. (p. 435) Tolerance to inhalants has been reported with heavy use. A mild withdrawal syndrome has been doc- umented but does not appear to be clinically signifi-cant. Among children with inhalant disorder, theproducts may be used several times a week, often onweekends and after school. Adults with inhalant ad-diction may use the substance at varying times duringeach day, or they may binge on the substance duringa period of several days. Effects on the Body Inhalants are absorbed through the lungs and reachthe CNS very rapidly. Inhalants generally act as CNSdepressants (Black & Andreasen, 2011). The effectsare relatively brief, lasting from several minutes to afew hours, depending on the specific substance andamount consumed. Central Nervous System Inhalants can cause both central and peripheral nervoussystem damage. Neurological damage, such as ataxia,peripheral and sensorimotor neuropathy, speech prob-lems, and tremor, can occur (Leamon et al., 2008).Other CNS effects that have been reported with heavyinhalant use include ototoxicity, encephalopathy,parkinsonism, and damage to the protective sheatharound certain nerve fibers in the brain and peripheralnervous system (Walton-Moss et al., 2010). Respiratory Effects Respiratory effects of inhalant use range fromcoughing and wheezing to dyspnea, emphysema,and pneumonia (Leamon et al., 2008). There is in-creased airway resistance due to inflammation of thepassages. Walton-Moss and associates (2010) state,\"Death can occur from suffocation, which may occurwhen inhaling from a paper or plastic bag in aclosed area\" (p. 208). Gastrointestinal Effects Abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting may occur. A rash may be present around the individual's noseand mouth. Unusual breath odors are common.Long-term use has resulted in reports of liver toxicity(Leamon et al., 2008). Renal System Effects Acute and chronic renal failure and hepatorenal syndrome have occurred. Renal toxicity from tolueneexposure has been reported, manifesting in renal intoxication as \"clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychologicalchanges that developed during or shortly after expo-sure to inhalants\" (APA, 2013). Symptoms are similarto alcohol intoxication and may include the Psychomotor retardation; lethargy Generalized muscle weakness Stupor or coma (at higher doses) Opioid Use Disorder A Profile of the Substance The term opioid refers to a group of compounds that includes opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic sub-stitutes. Opioids exert both a sedative and an anal-gesic effect, and their major medical uses are for therelief of pain, the treatment of diarrhea, and the reliefof coughing. These drugs have addictive qualities;that is, they are capable of inducing tolerance andphysiological and psychological addiction. Opioids are popular drugs of abuse in that they desensitize an individual to both psychological and380 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 380physiological pain and induce a sense of euphoria. Lethargy and indifference to the environment arecommon manifestations. Opioid abusers usually spend much of their time nourishing their habit. Individuals who are addicted toopioids are seldom able to hold a steady job that willsupport their need. They must therefore secure fundsfrom friends, relatives, or whomever they have not yetalienated with their addiction-related behavior. It is notuncommon for individuals who are addicted to opioidsto resort to illegal means of obtaining funds, such asburglary, robbery, prostitution, or selling drugs. Methods of administration of opioid drugs include oral, snorting, or smoking, and by subcutaneous, in-tramuscular, and intravenous injection. A selected listof opioid substances is presented in Table 23-4. Under close supervision, opioids are indispensable in the practice of medicine. They are the most effectiveagents known for the relief of intense pain. However,they also induce a pleasurable effect on the CNS thatpromotes their abuse. The physiological and psycho-logical addiction that occurs with opioids, as well as thedevelopment of profound tolerance, contribute to the addict's ongoing quest for more of the substance,regardless of the means. Historical Aspects In its crude form, opium is a brownish-black, gummysubstance obtained from the ripened pods of theopium poppy. References to the use of opiates havebeen found in the Egyptian, Greek, and Arabian cul-tures as early as 3000 BC. The drug became widely used both medicinally and recreationally throughoutEurope during the 16th and 17th centuries. Most ofthe opium supply came from China, where the drugwas introduced by Arabic traders in the late 17th cen-tury. Morphine, the primary active ingredient ofopium, was isolated in 1803 by the European chemistFrederich Serturner. Since that time, morphine,rather than crude opium, has been used throughoutthe world for the medical treatment of pain and diar-rhea. This process was facilitated in 1853 by the de-velopment of the hypodermic syringe, which made itpossible to deliver the undiluted morphine quicklyinto the body for rapid relief from pain. This development also created a new variety of opiate user in the United States: one who was able toself-administer the drug by injection. During thistime, there was also a large influx of Chinese immi-grants into the United States, who introduced opiumsmoking to this country. By the early part of the 20thcentury, opium addiction was widespread. In response to the concerns over widespread addiction, in 1914 the U.S. government passed theHarrison Narcotic Act, which created strict controlson the accessibility of opiates. Until that time, thesesubstances had been freely available to the publicwithout a prescription. The Harrison Act banned the use of opiates for other than medicinal purposesand drove the use of heroin underground. To this day,the beneficial uses of these substances are widely acclaimed within the medical profession, but the illicit trafficking of the drugs for recreational purposescontinues to resist most efforts aimed at control. Patterns of Use The development of opioid addiction may follow oneof two typical behavior patterns. The first occurs inCHAPTER 23 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 381 TABLE 23-4 Opioids and Related Substances CATEGORIES GENERIC (TRADE) NAMES COMMON STREET NAMES Opioids of natural origin Opioid derivatives Synthetic opiate-like drugsOpium (ingredient in various antidiarrheal agents) Morphine (Astramorph) Codeine big O M, white stuff, Miss Emma Terp, schoolboy, syrup, cody H, horse, junk, brown sugar, smack, skag, TNT, Harry DLs, 4s, lords, little D Perks, perkies, Oxy, O.C.Vike Doctors Dollies, doneTsApache, China girl, China fever, goodfella, jackpot4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 381the individual who has obtained the drug by prescrip- tion from a physician for the relief of a medical prob-lem. Abuse and addiction occur when the individualincreases the amount and frequency of use, justifyingthe behavior as symptom treatment. He or she be-comes obsessed with obtaining more and more of thesubstance, seeking out several physicians in order toreplenish and maintain supplies. The second pattern of behavior associated with addiction to opioids occurs among individuals whouse the drugs for recreational purposes and obtainthem from illegal sources. Opioids may be used aloneto induce the euphoric effects or in combination withstimulants or other drugs to enhance the euphoria or to counteract the depressant effects of the opioid.Tolerance develops and addiction occurs, leading theindividual to procure the substance by whatevermeans is required to support the habit. A recent government survey reported that there were 335,000 current heroin users aged 12 years andolder in the United States in 2012 (SAMHSA, 2013).The same survey revealed an estimated 6.8 millionpersons in the same age group who used prescriptionpsychotherapeutic drugs nonmedically. In the last 10 years, there has been a dramatic increase in theabuse of prescription pain medication, and it was the second most common type of illicit drug use inthe United States in 2012 (SAMHSA, 2013). Effects on the Body Opiates are sometimes classified as narcotic analgesics . They exert their major effects primarily on the CNS,the eyes, and the GI tract. Chronic morphine use oracute morphine toxicity is manifested by a syndromeof sedation, chronic constipation, decreased respira-tory rate, and pinpoint pupils. Intensity of symptomsis largely dose dependent. The following physiologi-cal effects are common with opioid use. Central Nervous System All opioids, opioid derivatives, and synthetic opioid-like drugs affect the CNS. Common manifestations include euphoria, mood changes, and mental cloud-ing. Other common CNS effects include drowsinessand pain reduction. Pupillary constriction occurs inresponse to stimulation of the oculomotor nerve.CNS depression of the respiratory centers within themedulla results in respiratory depression. The anti-tussive response is due to suppression of the coughcenter within the medulla. The nausea and vomitingcommonly associated with opiate ingestion is relatedto the stimulation of the centers within the medullathat trigger this response. Gastrointestinal Effects These drugs exert a profound effect on the GI tract.Both stomach and intestinal tone are increased,whereas peristaltic activity of the intestines is diminished.These effects lead to a marked decrease in the move-ment of food through the GI tract. This is a notable ther-apeutic effect in the treatment of severe diarrhea. Infact, no drugs have yet been developed that are more effective than the opioids for this purpose. However,constipation, and even fecal impaction, may be a seriousproblem for the chronic opioid user. Cardiovascular Effects In therapeutic doses, opioids have minimal effect on the action of the heart. Morphine is used exten-sively to relieve pulmonary edema and the pain of myocardial infarction in cardiac clients. At highdoses, opioids induce hypotension, which may becaused by direct action on the heart or by opioid-induced histamine release. Sexual Functioning With opioid use, there is decreased sexual function anddiminished libido (National Cancer Institute, 2012).Delayed ejaculation, impotence, and orgasm failure (inboth men and women) may occur. Sexual side effectsfrom opioids appear to be largely influenced by dosage. Opioid Intoxication Opioid intoxication constitutes clinically significantproblematic behavioral or psychological changes thatdevelop during, or shortly after, opioid use (APA, 2013).Symptoms include initial euphoria followed by apathy,dysphoria, psychomotor agitation or retardation, andimpaired judgment. Physical symptoms include (or dilation anoxia from severeoverdose), drowsiness, slurred speech, and impairmentin attention or memory (APA, 2013). Symptoms areconsistent with the half-life of most opioid drugs, andusually last for several hours. Severe opioid intoxicationcan lead to respiratory depression, coma, and death. Opioid Withdrawal Opioid withdrawal produces a syndrome of symptomsthat develops after cessation of, or reduction in, heavyand prolonged use of an opiate or related substance.Symptoms include dysphoric mood, pupillary dila-tion, piloerection, sweating, fever,and insomnia (APA, 2013). With short-acting drugs suchas heroin, withdrawal symptoms occur within 6 to 8 hours after the last dose, peak within 1 to 3 days, andgradually subside over a period of 5 to 10 days (Walton-Moss et al., 2010). With longer-acting drugs such asmethadone, withdrawal symptoms begin within 1 to 3 days after the last dose, peak between days 4 and 6,and are complete in 14 to 21 days (Leamon et al., 2008).Withdrawal from the ultra-short-acting meperidine begins quickly, reaches a peak in 8 to 12 hours, and iscomplete in 4 to 5 days (Sadock & Sadock, 2007).382 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 382Hallucinogen Use Disorder A Profile of the Substance Hallucinogenic substances are capable of distorting an individual's perception of reality. They have theability to alter sensory perception and induce hallu-cinations. For this reason they have sometimes beenreferred to as \"mind expanding.\" Some of the mani-festations have been likened to a psychotic break. Thehallucinations experienced by an individual withschizophrenia, however, are most often auditory,whereas substance-induced hallucinations are usuallyvisual (Mack, Franklin, & Frances, 2003). Perceptualdistortions have been reported by some users as spir-itual, as giving a sense of depersonalization (observ-ing oneself having the experience), or as being atpeace with self and the universe. Others, who describetheir experiences as \"bad trips,\" report feelings ofpanic and a fear of dying or going insane. A commondanger reported with hallucinogenic drugs is that of\"flashbacks,\" or a spontaneous reoccurrence of thehallucinogenic state without ingestion of the drug.These can occur months after the drug was last taken. Recurrent use can produce tolerance, encouraging users to resort to higher and higher dosages. No evidence of physical addiction is detectable when the drug is withdrawn; however, recurrent use appearsto induce a psychological addiction to the insight-inducing experiences that a user may associate withepisodes of hallucinogen use (Sadock & Sadock,2007). This psychological addiction varies accordingto the drug, the dose, and the individual user. Hallu-cinogens are highly unpredictable in the effects theymay induce each time they are used. Many of the hallucinogenic substances have struc- tural similarities. Some are produced synthetically; oth-ers are natural products of plants and fungi. A selectedlist of hallucinogens is presented in Table 23-5. Historical Aspects Archeological data obtained with carbon-14 datingsuggest that hallucinogens have been used as part ofreligious ceremonies and at social gatherings by NativeAmericans for as long as 7,000 years (Goldstein, 2002).Use of the peyote cactus as part of religious cere-monies in the southwestern part of the United Statesstill occurs today, although this ritual use has greatlydiminished. LSD was first synthesized in 1943 by Dr. Albert Hoffman (Goldstein, 2002). It was used as a clinicalresearch tool to investigate the biochemical etiologyof schizophrenia. It soon reached the illicit market,however, and its abuse began to overshadow the research effort. The abuse of hallucinogens reached a peak in the late 1960s, waned during the 1970s, and returned tofavor in the 1980s with the so-called designer drugs(e.g., andmethoxy-amphetamine is PCP, evenCHAPTER 23 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 383 TABLE 23-5 Hallucinogens CATEGORIES GENERIC (TRADE) NAMES COMMON STREET NAMES Naturally occurring hallucinogens Synthetic compounds *Cross-listed with the CNS stimulantsMescaline (the primary active ingredient of the peyote cactus) Psilocybin and psilocin (active ingredients of (morning glory seeds) Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)\u2014synthetically produced from a fungal substance found on rye or a chemical substance found in morning glory seeds Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) peyote Magic mushroom, God's flesh, shrooms Heavenly blue, pearly gates, flying saucers Acid, cube, big D, California sunshine, microdots, blue dots, sugar, orange wedges, peace tablets, purple haze,cupcakes Businessman's trip STP (serenity, tranquility, peace) Angel dust, hog, peace pill, rocket fuelSpecial K, vitamin K, kit katXTC, ecstasy, Adam, EveLove drugBath Salts (also called blue silk, cloud 9, ivory wave, vanilla sky, white knight, and others)4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 383though many of its effects are perceived as undesir- able. A number of deaths have been directly attributedto the use of PCP, and numerous accidental deathshave occurred as a result of overdose and of the be-havioral changes the drug precipitates. A derivative of PCP, ketamine, which is a preoperative anesthetic,also is abused for its psychedelic properties. It pro-duces effects similar to, but somewhat less intensethan, those of PCP. Several therapeutic uses of LSD have been pro- posed, including the treatment of chronic alcoholismand the reduction of intractable pain such as occursin malignant disease. A great deal more research isrequired regarding the therapeutic uses of LSD. Atthis time, there is no real evidence of the safety andefficacy of the drug in humans. Patterns of Use Use of hallucinogens is usually episodic. Because cognitive and perceptual abilities are so markedly affected by these substances, the user must set asidetime from normal daily activities for indulging in theconsequences. According to the SAMHSA (2013) re-port, hallucinogens were used in the previous 30-dayperiod before the survey in 2012 by approximately 1.1 million persons (0.4 percent) aged 12 or older. The use of LSD does not lead to the development of physical addiction or withdrawal symptoms (Sadock& Sadock, 2007). However, tolerance does developquickly and to a high degree. In fact, an individualwho uses LSD repeatedly for a period of 3 to 4 daysmay develop complete tolerance to the drug. Recoveryfrom the tolerance also occurs very rapidly (in 4 to 7 days), so that the individual is able to achieve the desired effect from the drug repeatedly and often. PCP is usually taken episodically, in binges that can last for several days. However, some chronic userstake the substance daily. Physical addiction does notoccur with PCP; however, psychological addictioncharacterized by craving for the drug has been re-ported in chronic users, as has the development oftolerance. Tolerance apparently develops quicklywith frequent use. Psilocybin is an ingredient of the Psilocybe mush- room indigenous to the United States and Mexico.Ingestion of these mushrooms produces an effectsimilar to that of LSD but of a shorter duration.This hallucinogenic chemical can now be producedsynthetically. Mescaline is the only hallucinogenic compound used legally for religious purposes today by members of theNative American Church of the United States. It is theprimary active ingredient of the peyote cactus. Neitherphysical nor psychological addiction occurs with the useof mescaline, although, as with other hallucinogens, tol-erance can develop quickly with frequent use.Among the very potent hallucinogens of the current drug culture are those that are categorized as deriva-tives of amphetamines. These include 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM, STP), MDMA, andMDA. At lower doses, these drugs produce the \"high\"associated with CNS stimulants. At higher doses, hallu-cinogenic effects occur. These drugs have existed formany years but were rediscovered in the mid-1980s. Be- cause of the rapid increase in recreational use, theDEA imposed an emergency classification of MDMAas a Schedule I drug in 1985. MDMA, or Ecstasy, is asynthetic drug with both stimulant and hallucinogenicqualities. It has a chemical structure similar to metham-phetamine and mescaline, and it has become widelyavailable throughout the world. Because of its growingpopularity, the demand for this drug has led to tabletsand capsules being sold as \"Ecstasy,\" but which are not pure MDMA. Many contain drugs such asmetham phetamine, PCP, p-methoxyamphetamine hallucinogenic properties; more toxic than MDMA).This practice has increased the dangers associated withMDMA use. Effects on the Body The effects produced by the various hallucinogensare highly unpredictable. The variety of effects maybe related to dosage, the mental state of the individ-ual, and the environment in which the substance isused. Some common effects have & and vomiting Chills Pupil dilation Increased pulse, blood pressure, and temperature Mild dizziness Trembling Loss of appetite Insomnia Sweating A slowing of respirations Elevation in blood sugar Psychological Effects Heightened response to color, texture, and sounds Heightened body awareness Distortion of vision Sense of slowing of time All feelings magnified: love, lust, hate, joy, anger,pain, terror, despair Fear of losing control Paranoia, panic Euphoria, bliss Projection of self into dreamlike images Serenity, peace384 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 384Depersonalization Derealization effects of hallucinogens are not always pleasur- able for the user. Two types of toxic reactions are known to occur. The first is the panic reaction, or \"bad trip.\"Symptoms include an intense level of anxiety, fear, andstimulation. The individual hallucinates and fears goinginsane. Paranoia and acute psychosis may be evident. The second type of toxic reaction to hallucinogens is the flashback. This phenomenon refers to the transient, spontaneous repetition of a previous hallucinogen-induced experience that occurs in the absence of thesubstance. The DSM-5 (APA, 2013) refers to this as hal- lucinogen persisting perception disorder. Various studies have reported that 15 to 80 percent of hallucinogen users re-port having experienced flashbacks (Sadock & Sadock,2007). Hallucinogen Intoxication Symptoms of hallucinogen intoxication develop during, or shortly after hallucinogen use. Maladaptive be-havioral or psychological changes include marked anxietyor depression, ideas of reference (a type of delusionalthinking that all activity within one's environment is \"re-ferred to\" [about] one's self), fear of losing one's mind,paranoid ideation, and impaired judgment (APA, 2013).Perceptual changes occur while the individual is fully awake and alert and include intensification of perceptions, depersonalization, derealization, illusions,hallucinations, and synesthesias (APA, 2013). Because hal-lucinogens are sympathomimetics, they can cause tachy-cardia, hypertension, sweating, blurred vision, pupillarydilation, and tremors (Black & Andreasen, 2011). Symptoms of PCP intoxication are unpredictable. Specific symptoms are dose related and may be manifested by impulsiveness, impaired judgment, as-saultiveness, and belligerence, or the stuporous, or (Leamon et al.,2008; Walton-Moss symptomsinclude or horizontal nystagmus, hyperten-sion, tachycardia, ataxia, diminished pain sensation,muscle rigidity, and seizures (Leamon et al., 2008;Walton-Moss et al., 2010). Symptoms of ketamine intoxication appear similar to those of PCP. General effects of MDMA (Ecstasy) include in- creased heart rate, blood pressure, and body tempera-ture; dehydration; confusion; insomnia; and paranoia.Overdose can result in panic attacks, hallucinations, severe hyperthermia, dehydration, and seizures. Deathcan occur from kidney or cardiovascular failure. Cannabis Use Disorder A Profile of the Substance Cannabis is second only to alcohol as the most widely abused drug in the United States. The majorpsychoactive ingredient of this class of substances isdelta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). It occurs nat-urally in the plant Cannabis sativa , which grows read- ily in warm climates. Marijuana, the most prevalenttype of cannabis preparation, is composed of thedried leaves, stems, and flowers of the plant. Hashishis a more potent concentrate of the resin derivedfrom the flowering tops of the plant. Hash oil is avery concentrated form of THC made by boilinghashish in a solvent and filtering out the solid matter(Street Drugs , 2012). Cannabis products are usually smoked in the form of loosely rolled cigarettes.Cannabis can also be taken orally when it is pre-pared in food, but about two to three times theamount of cannabis must be ingested orally to equalthe potency of that obtained by the inhalation of itssmoke (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). At moderate dosages, cannabis drugs produce ef- fects resembling alcohol and other CNS depressants.By depressing higher brain centers, they release lowercenters from inhibitory influences. There has beensome controversy in the past over the classification ofthese substances. They are not narcotics, although theyare legally classified as controlled substances. They arenot hallucinogens, although in very high dosages theycan induce hallucinations. They are not sedative-hypnotics, although they most closely resemble thesesubstances. Like sedative-hypnotics, their action occursin the ascending reticular activating system. Psychological addiction has been shown to occur with cannabis, and tolerance can occur. Controversyhas existed about whether physiological addiction oc-curs with cannabis. In the past, symptoms of cannabiswithdrawal were considered less than clinically signif-icant to include the diagnosis in the DSM. However,the DSM-5 Substance-Related Work Group deter- mined that subsequent research studies have pro-vided significant data to support cannabis withdrawalas a valid and reliable syndrome that can negativelyimpact abstinence attempts of heavy cannabis users.The diagnosis of cannabis withdrawal is included inthe DSM-5. Common cannabis preparations are presented in Table 23-6.CHAPTER 23 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 385 TABLE 23-6 Cannabinoids COMMON STREET CATEGORY PREPARATIONS NAMES Cannabis Marijuana HashishJoint, weed, pot, grass, Mary Jane, Texas hay, stick Hash, bhang, ganja, sativa have been used therapeu- tically for nearly 5,000 years (Julien, 2008). Cannabis was first employed in China and India as an antisepticand an analgesic. Its use later spread to the MiddleEast, Africa, and Eastern Europe. In the United States, medical interest in the use of cannabis arose during the early part of the 19th cen-tury. Many articles were published espousing its usefor many and varied reasons. The drug was almost ascommonly used for medicinal purposes as aspirin istoday and could be purchased without a prescriptionin any drug store. It was purported to have antibacter-ial and anticonvulsant capabilities, to decrease intraoc-ular pressure, decrease pain, help in the treatment ofasthma, increase appetite, and generally raise one'smorale. The drug went out of favor primarily because of the huge variation in potency within batches of med-ication caused by the variations in the THC contentof different plants. Other medications were favoredfor their greater degree of solubility and faster onsetof action than cannabis products. A federal law putan end to its legal use in 1937, after an association between marijuana and criminal activity became evi-dent. In the 1960s, marijuana became the symbol ofthe \"antiestablishment\" generation, at which time itreached its peak as a drug of abuse. Research continues in regard to the possible ther- apeutic uses of cannabis. It has been shown to be aneffective agent for relieving the nausea and vomitingassociated with cancer chemotherapy, when other an-tinausea medications fail. It has also been used in thetreatment of chronic pain, glaucoma, multiple scle-rosis, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome(Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Advocates who praise the therapeutic usefulness and support the legalization of the cannabinoids per-sist within the United States today. Such groups as theAlliance for Cannabis Therapeutics (ACT) and theNational Organization for the Reform of MarijuanaLaws (NORML) have lobbied extensively to allow dis-ease sufferers easier access to the drug. The medicaluse of marijuana has been legalized by a number ofstates. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (USDEA,2011) has stated: The DEA supports ongoing research into potential medicinal uses of marijuana's active ingredients. [Cur-rently] there are 111 researchers registered with theDEA to perform studies with marijuana, marijuana extracts, and non-tetrahydrocannabinol marijuana derivatives that exist in the plant, such as cannabidioland cannabinol. Studies include evaluation of abusepotential, physical/psychological effects, adverse effects, therapeutic potential, and detection. Fourteenof the researchers are approved to conduct researchwith smoked marijuana on human subjects. At pres-ent, however, the clear weight of the evidence is thatsmoked marijuana is harmful. No matter what med-ical condition has been studied, other drugs alreadyapproved by the FDA have been proven to be saferand more effective than smoked marijuana. (p. 5) A great deal more research is required to deter- mine the long-term effects of the drug. Until results indicate otherwise, it is safe to assume that the harm-ful effects of the drug outweigh the benefits. Patterns of Use In its 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health,SAMHSA (2013) reported that an estimated 23.8 million Americans aged 12 years or older were cur-rent illicit drug users, meaning they had used an illicitdrug during the month before the survey interview.This estimate represents approximately 9.2 percentof the population aged 12 years old or older. Mari-juana is the most commonly used illicit drug. In 2012,it was used by 79 percent of current illicit drug users.This constitutes about 18.8 million users of marijuanain the United States in the year 2012. Many people incorrectly regard cannabis as a sub- stance of low abuse potential. This lack of knowledgehas promoted use of the substance by some individu-als who believe it is harmless. Tolerance, although ittends to decline rapidly, does occur with chronic use.As tolerance develops, physical addiction also occurs,resulting in a withdrawal syndrome upon cessation ofdrug use. One controversy that exists regarding marijuana is whether its use leads to the use of other illicit drugs.Leamon and associates (2008) stated, \"A relationshiphas consistently been shown between early, regularcannabis use and subsequent abuse of other drugs\"(p. 381). Effects on the Body Following is a summary of some of the effects that have been attributed to marijuana in recentyears. Undoubtedly, as research continues, evidenceof additional physiological and psychological effectswill be made available. Cardiovascular Effects Cannabis ingestion induces tachycardia and orthosta-tic hypotension (National Institutes of Health [NIH],2012). With the decrease in blood pressure, myocar-dial oxygen supply is decreased. Tachycardia in turnincreases oxygen demand. Respiratory Effects Marijuana produces a greater amount of \"tar\" thanits equivalent weight in tobacco. Because of themethod by which marijuana is smoked\u2014that is, the386 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 386smoke is held in the lungs for as long as possible to achieve the desired effect\u2014larger amounts of tar aredeposited in the lungs, promoting deleterious effectsto the lungs. Although the initial reaction to the marijuana is bronchodilatation, thereby facilitating respiratoryfunction, chronic use results in obstructive airway dis-orders (NIH, 2012). Frequent marijuana users oftenhave laryngitis, bronchitis, hoarseness.Cannabis smoke contains more carcinogens than to-bacco smoke; therefore, lung damage and cancer arereal risks for heavy users (NIH, 2012). Reproductive Effects Some studies have shown that, with heavy marijuanause, men may have a decrease in sperm count, motil-ity, and structure. In women, heavy marijuana use mayresult in a suppression of ovulation, disruption inmenstrual cycles, and alteration of hormone levels. Central Nervous System Effects Acute CNS effects of marijuana are dose related.Many people report a feeling of being \"high\"\u2014theequivalent of being \"drunk\" on alcohol. Symptoms include feelings of euphoria, relaxed inhibitions, dis-orientation, depersonalization, and relaxation. Athigher doses, sensory alterations may occur, includingimpairment in judgment of time and distance, recentmemory, and learning ability. Physiological symptomsmay include tremors, muscle rigidity, and conjunctivalredness. Toxic effects are generally characterized bypanic reactions. Very heavy usage has been shown toprecipitate an acute psychosis that is self-limited andshort-lived once the drug is removed from the body(Julien, 2008). Heavy long-term cannabis use is also associated with a condition called amotivational syndrome . When this syndrome occurs, the individual is totally preoc-cupied with using the substance. Symptoms includelethargy, apathy, social and personal deterioration,and lack of motivation. This syndrome appears to bemore common in countries in which the most potentpreparations are used and where the substance ismore freely available than it is in the United States. Sexual Functioning Marijuana is reported to enhance the sexual experi-ence in both men and women. The intensified sen-sory awareness and the subjective slowness of timeperception are thought to increase sexual satisfaction.Marijuana also enhances the sexual functioning by re-leasing inhibitions for certain activities that wouldnormally be restrained. Cannabis Intoxication Cannabis intoxication is evidenced by the presenceof clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes that develop during, or shortlyafter, cannabis use. Symptoms include impairedmotor coordination, euphoria, anxiety, a sensation ofslowed time, impaired judgment, and social with-drawal. Physical symptoms include conjunctival injec-tion, increased appetite, dry mouth, and tachycardia(APA, 2013). The impairment of motor skills lasts for8 to 12 hours and interferes with the operation ofmotor vehicles. These effects are additive to those ofalcohol, which is commonly used in combination withcannabis (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Cannabis Withdrawal The DSM-5 describes a syndrome of symptoms that occur upon cessation of cannabis use that has beenheavy and prolonged. Symptoms occur within a weekfollowing cessation of use and may include any of thefollowing: Irritability, anger, or aggression Nervousness or anxiety Sleep difficulty (e.g., insomnia, disturbing dreams) Decreased appetite or weight loss Restlessness Depressed mood Physical symptoms, such as abdominal pain, tremors,sweating, fever, chills, or headache Tables 23-7 and 23-8 include summaries of the psychoactive substances, including symptoms of in-toxication, withdrawal, use, overdose, possible thera-peutic uses, and trade and common names by whichthey may be referred. The dynamics of substance usedisorders using the Transactional Model of Stress/Adaptation are presented in Figure 23-3. Application of the Nursing Process Assessment In the pre-introductory phase of relationship devel-opment, the nurse must examine his or her feelingsabout working with a client who abuses substances. Ifthese behaviors are viewed as morally wrong and thenurse has internalized these attitudes from very earlyin life, it may be very difficult to suppress judgmentalfeelings. The role that alcohol or other substances hasplayed (or plays) in the life of the nurse most certainlywill affect the way in which he or she interacts with aclient who has a substance use disorder. How are attitudes examined? Some individuals may have sufficient ability for introspection to be ableto recognize on their own whether they have unre-solved issues related to substance abuse. For others,it may be more helpful to discuss these issues in agroup situation, where insight may be gained fromfeedback regarding the perceptions of others.CHAPTER 23 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 3874092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 387388 UNIT 4 Nursing Care Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial AdaptationTABLE 23-7 Psychoactive Substances: A Profile Summary CLASS OF DRUGS SYMPTOMS OF USE THERAPEUTIC USES SYMPTOMS OF OVERDOSE TR ADE NAMES COMMON NAMES CNS DEPRESSANTS Alcohol Other (barbiturates and nonbarbiturates) CNS related drugs Cocaine Synthetic stimulants OP IOIDSRelaxation, loss of inhibitions, lack of concentration, drowsiness, slurredspeech, sleep Same as alcohol Hyperactivity , ag itation, euphoria, insomnia, loss of appetite Euphoria, talkative-ness, pulse,dilated tothink clearly, rate, chest pains Euphoria, lethargy, drowsiness, lack ofmotivation, constrictedpupilsAntidote for methanol consumption; ingredient in manypharmacological concentrates Relief from anxiety and insomnia; as anticonvulsants clammy pulse;coma; death fever, agitation, disorientation,tremors, delirium, convulsions, possibledeath Cardiac arrhythmias, headache, convulsions,hypertension, rapidheart rate, coma, possible death Hallucinations, convulsions, pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, coma,cardiac arrest, possibledeath Depression, paranoia, delusions, suicidalthoughts, seizures,panic attacks, nausea,vomiting, attack,stroke, hallucinations,aggresive behavior Shallow pulse, clammyskin, pulmonaryedema, respiratory arrest, convulsions,coma, possible deathEthyl alcohol, highballs, nightcaps,moonshine, whitelightning, firewater Red birds, yellow birds, blue birds Blues/yellows Green & whitesMickiesDowners Uppers, pep pills, wakeups, bennies, eye-openers, speed,black beauties, sweet As Coke, flake, gold dust,girl, cecil, C, toot, blow,crack Bath salts, bliss, vanilla sky, ivory wave, purple wave Snow, stuff, H, harry, horse M, morph, Miss EmmaSchoolboyLordsDoctorsDolliesPerkiesTsBig O, black stuff4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page and CANNABINOIDSVisual hallucinations, dis- orientation, confusion, delusions,euphoria, anxiety,panic, increased pulse Relaxation, talkativeness, lowered inhibitions,euphoria, moodswingsLSD has been proposed in the treatment ofchronic alcoholism,and in the reductionof intractable pain Marijuana has been used for relief of nausea and vomitingassociated with anti-neoplastic chemother-apy and cube, big peace pillMescBusinessman's tripSerenity and peaceEcstasy, XTCSpecial K, vitamin K, kit katBath Salts Marijuana, pot, grass, joint, Mary Jane, MJ Hash, rope, Sweet Lucy4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 389390 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation TABLE 23-8 Summary of Symptoms Associated With the Syndromes of Intoxication and Withdrawal CLASS OF DRUGS INTOXICATION WITHDRAWAL COMMENTS Alcohol Amphetamines and related substances Caffeine Cannabis Cocaine Inhalants Nicotine OpioidsAggressiveness, impaired judgment, insomnia,flushed face, gastrointestinal ofinexhaustibility, psychomotoragitation Euphoria, anxiety, suspiciousness, sensation of slowed time, impaired judgment, socialwithdrawal, tachycardia, conjunctival redness, increasedappetite, hallucinations elevatedblood pressure, anxiety, depressed mood, irritability,hallucinations, headache,insomnia, seizures Anxiety, depressed mood, irritability, craving ideation irritability, insomnia, loss of appetite, depressed mood, tremors,fever, chills, headache, abdominal pain Depression, anxiety, irritability, fatigue, insomnia or hyper-somnia, psychomotor agita-tion, paranoid or suicidalideation, apathy, socialwithdrawal Craving drug, irritability, anger, frustration, anxiety,difficulty concentrating, restlessness, decreasedheart rate, increased appetite, weight gain, tremor,headaches, insomnia Craving for the drug, nausea/ vomiting, muscle aches,lacrimation or rhinorrhea,pupillary dilation, piloerec-tion or sweating, diarrhea,yawning, fever, insomniaAlcohol withdrawal begins within 4-12 hr after last drink.May progress to deliriumtremens on 2nd or 3rd day.Use of Librium or Serax iscommon for substitutiontherapy.

Whether alone or in a group, the nurse may gain a greater understanding about attitudes and feelings related to substance abuse by responding to the fol-lowing types of questions. As written here, the ques-tions are specific to alcohol, but they could beadapted for any substance. What are my drinking patterns? If I drink, why do I drink? When, where, and howmuch? If I don't drink, why do I abstain? Am I comfortable with my drinking patterns? If I decided not to drink anymore, would that be aproblem for me? What did I learn from my parents about drinking? Have my attitudes changed as an adult? What are my feelings about people who become intoxicated? Does it seem more acceptable for some individualsthan for others? Do I ever use terms like \"sot,\" \"drunk,\" or \"boozer,\"to describe some individuals who overindulge, yetoverlook it in others? Do I ever overindulge myself? Has the use of alcohol (by me or others) affectedmy life in any way? Do I see alcohol/drug abuse as a sign of weakness?A moral problem? An illness? Unless nurses fully understand and accept their own attitudes and feelings, they cannot be empathetictoward clients' problems. Clients in recovery need toknow they are accepted for themselves, regardless ofpast behaviors. Nurses must be able to separate theclient from the behavior and to accept that individualwith unconditional positive regard.Assessment Tools Nurses are often the individuals who perform the ad-mission interview. A variety of assessment tools are ap-propriate for use in chemical dependency units. Anursing history and assessment tool was presented inChapter 9 of this text. With some adaptation, it is anappropriate instrument for creating a database onclients who abuse substances. Box 23-1 presents a drughistory and assessment that could be used in conjunc-tion with the general biopsychosocial assessment. The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale, Revised (CIWA-Ar) is an excellent toolthat is used by many hospitals to assess risk and sever-ity of withdrawal from alcohol. It may be used for ini-tial assessment as well as ongoing monitoring ofalcohol withdrawal symptoms. A copy of the CIWA-Aris presented in Box 23-2. Other screening tools exist for determining whether an individual has a problem with substances.Two such tools developed by the American PsychiatricAssociation for the diagnosis of alcoholism includethe Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test and theCAGE Questionnaire (Boxes 23-3 and 23-4). Somepsychiatric units administer these surveys to all clientswho are admitted to help determine if there is a sec-ondary alcoholism problem in addition to the psychi-atric problem for which the client is being admitted(sometimes called dual diagnosis). It would be possi- ble to adapt these tools to use in diagnosing problemswith other drugs as well. Dual Diagnosis If it is determined that the client has a coexisting sub-stance disorder and mental illness, he or she may be4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 391392 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation Precipitating Event (Any event sufficiently stressful to threaten an already weak ego; the precipitating event for the dependent person may be the onset of withdrawal symptoms) Possible hereditary and biochemical factors Negative role modeling; positive conditioning; cultural/ethnic Genetic Influences:Past Experiences:Existing Conditions: Cognitive appraisal * Primary * (Perceived threat to self-concept or physical integrity) * Secondary * Quality of response SubstanceAbuseSubstanceDependenceBecause of weak ego strength, patient is unable to use coping mecha-nisms effectively.

Counseling for the mentally ill person whoabuses substances takes a different approach than thatwhich is directed at individuals who abuse substancesbut are not mentally ill. In the latter, many counselorsuse direct confrontation of the substance use behav-iors. This approach is thought to be detrimental to thetreatment of a person with mental illness (Mack et al.,2003). Most dual diagnosis programs take a more supportive and less confrontational approach.4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 394CHAPTER 23 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 395 BOX 23-3 Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST) Answer the following questions by placing an X under yes or no.* Yes No 1.

Group members offer encourage- ment and practical advice to each other. Psychody-namic therapy can be useful for some individuals withdual diagnosis by delving into the personal history ofhow psychiatric disorders and substance abuse have re-inforced one another and how the cycle can be broken(Harvard Medical School, 2003). Cognitive and behav-ioral therapies are helpful in training clients to moni-tor moods and thought patterns that lead to substanceabuse. With these therapies, clients also learn to avoidsubstance use and to cope with cravings and the temp-tation to relapse (Harvard Medical School, 2003). Individuals with dual diagnoses should be encouraged to attend 12-step recovery programs (e.g., AlcoholicsAnonymous or Narcotics Anonymous). Dual diagnosisclients are sometimes resistant to attending 12-step programs, and they often do better in groups specificallydesigned for people with psychiatric disorders. Substance-abuse groups are usually integrated into regular programming for the psychiatric client with adual diagnosis. An individual in a psychiatric facility orday treatment program will attend a substance-abusegroup periodically in lieu of another scheduled activitytherapy. Topics are directed toward areas that areunique to clients with a mental illness, such as mixingmedications with other substances, as well as topics thatare common to primary substances abusers. Individualsare encouraged to discuss their personal problems. Mack and associates (2003) have stated: The dual diagnosis patient often falls through the cracks of the treatment system. Severe psychiatric disorders often preclude full treatment in substanceabuse clinics or self-help groups. The addition ofother [psychiatric] disorders to a substance use dis-order greatly complicates diagnosis and makes treat-ment more difficult. (p. 359) Continued attendance at 12-step group meetings is encouraged on discharge from treatment. Family involvement is enlisted, and preventive strategies areoutlined. Individual case management is common, andsuccess is often promoted by this close supervision. Diagnosis/Outcome Identification The next step in the nursing process is to identify appropriate nursing diagnoses by analyzing the datacollected during the assessment phase. The individualwho abuses or is dependent on substances undoubt-edly has many unmet physical and emotional needs.Table 23-9 presents a list of client behaviors and theNANDA nursing diagnoses that correspond to those396 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation TABLE 23-9 Assigning Nursing Diagnoses to Behaviors Commonly Associated With Substance Use Disorders BEHAVIORS NURSING DIAGNOSES Makes statements such as, \"I don't have a problem with (substance). I can quit any time I want to.\" Delays seeking assistance; does not perceive problems related to use of substances; minimizes use of substances; unable to admit impact of disease on life pattern Abuse of chemical agents; destructive behavior toward others and self; inability to meet basic needs; inability to meet role expectations; risk taking Loss of weight, pale conjunctiva and mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor , electrolyte imbalance, anemia, drinks alcohol instead of eating Risk factors: Malnutrition, altered immune condition, failing to avoid exposure to pathogens Criticizes self and others, self-destructive behavior (abuse of substances as a coping mechanism), dysfunctional family background Denies that substance is harmful; continues to use substance in light of obvious consequences FOR THE CLIENT WITHDRAWING FROM CNS DEPRESSANTS:Risk factors: CNS agitation (tremors, elevated blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, illusions, tachycardia, anxiety , seizures) F OR THE CLIENT WITHDRAWING FROM CNS STIMULANTS: Risk factors: Intense feelings of lassitude and depression; \"crashing,\" suicidal ideationIneffective denial Ineffective coping Imbalanced nutrition: Less than body requirements/Deficient fluid volume Risk for infection Chronic low self-esteemDeficient knowledge Risk for injury Risk for suicide4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 396behaviors, which may be used in planning care for the client with a substance use disorder. Outcome Criteria The following criteria may be used for measurementof outcomes in the care of the client with substance-related disorders. The client: Has not experienced physical injury. Has not caused harm to self or others. Accepts responsibility for own behavior. Acknowledges association between personal prob-lems and use of substance(s). Demonstrates more adaptive coping mechanismsthat can be used in stressful situations (instead oftaking substances). Shows no signs or symptoms of infection or malnutrition. Exhibits evidence of increased self-worth by at-tempting new projects without fear of failure andby demonstrating less defensive behavior towardothers. Verbalizes importance of abstaining from use ofsubstances in order to maintain optimal wellness. Planning/Implementation Implementation with clients who abuse substances isa long-term process, often beginning with detoxifica- tion and progressing to total abstinence. The follow- ing section presents a group of selected nursingdiagnoses, with short- and long-term goals and nurs-ing interventions for each. Risk for Injury Risk for injury is defined as \"at risk for injury as a result of [internal or external] environmental conditions in-teracting with the individual's adaptive and defensiveresources\" (NANDA International [NANDA-I], 2012,p. 430). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal Client's condition will stabilize within 72 hours. Long-Term Goal Client will not experience physical injury. Interventions For the Client in Substance Withdrawal Assess the client's level of disorientation to deter-mine specific requirements for safety. Obtain a drug history, if possible. It is important todetermine the type of substance(s) used, the timeand amount of last use, the length and frequencyof use, and the amount used on a daily basis. Because subjective history is often not accurate, obtain a urine sample for laboratory analysis of substance content. It is important to keep the client in as quiet an environment as possible. Excessive stimuli may increase client agitation. A private room is ideal. Observe client behaviors frequently. If seriousnessof the condition warrants, it may be necessary to assign a staff person on a one-to-one basis. Accompany and assist client when ambulating, anduse a wheelchair for transporting the client longdistances. Pad the headboard and side rails of the bed withthick towels to protect the client in case of a seizure. Suicide precautions may need to be instituted forthe client withdrawing from CNS stimulants. Ensure that smoking materials and other potentiallyharmful objects are stored away from client's access. Frequently orient the client to reality and the surroundings. Monitor the client's vital signs every 15 minutes ini-tially and less frequently as acute symptoms subside. Follow the medication regimen, as ordered by thephysician. Common psychopharmacological inter-vention for substance intoxication and withdrawalis presented later in this chapter under the sectiontitled \"Treatment Modalities for Substance-RelatedDisorders.\" Ineffective Denial Ineffective denial is defined as \"conscious or unconscious attempt to disavow the knowledge or meaning of anevent to reduce anxiety/fear, but leading to the detri-ment of health\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 358). Table 23-10presents this nursing diagnosis in care plan format. Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal Client will divert attention away from external is-sues and focus on behavioral outcomes associatedwith substance use. Long-Term Goal Client will verbalize acceptance of responsibility forown behavior and acknowledge association be-tween substance use and personal problems. Interventions Begin by working to develop a trusting nurse-clientrelationship. Be honest and keep all promises. Convey an attitude of acceptance to the client. Ensure that he or she understands \"It is not you butCHAPTER 23 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 3974092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 397398 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation Table 23-10 | CARE PLAN FOR A CLIENT WITH A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER NURSING DIAGNOSIS: INEFFECTIVE DENIAL RELATED TO: Weak, underdeveloped ego EVIDENCED BY: Statements indicating no problem with substance use OUTCOME CRITERIA NURSING INTERVENTIONS RATIONALE Short-Term Goal \u0081 Client will divert attention away from external issues and focus on behavioral outcomes associated with substance use.

Peer feedback is often more accepted than feedbackfrom authority figures. Peer pressure can be astrong factor as well as the association with individ-uals who are experiencing or who have experi-enced similar problems. Offer immediate positive recognition of client's expressions of insight gained regarding illness and acceptance of responsibility for own behavior.Positive reinforcement enhances self-esteem andencourages repetition of desirable behaviors. Ineffective Coping Ineffective coping is defined as the \"inability to form a valid appraisal of the stressors, inadequate choices ofpracticed responses, and/or inability to use availableresources\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 348). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal Client will express true feelings about using sub-stances as a method of coping with stress. Long-Term Goal Client will be able to verbalize use of adaptive coping mechanisms, instead of substance abuse, inresponse to stress. Interventions Spend time with the client and establish a trustingrelationship. Set limits on manipulative behavior. Be sure that theclient knows what is acceptable, what is not, and theconsequences for violating the limits set. Ensure thatall staff maintain consistency with this intervention.The client is unable to establish his or her own limits,so limits must be set for the client. Unless adminis-tration of consequences for violation of limits is con-sistent, manipulative behavior will not be eliminated.CHAPTER 23 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 399 Table 23-10 | CARE PLAN FOR A CLIENT WITH A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER\u2014 cont'd OUTCOME CRITERIA NURSING INTERVENTIONS RATIONALE 8.Offer immediate positive recogni- tion of client's expressions of in-sight regarding illness of responsibility forown behavior .8.P ositive reinforcement enhances self-esteem and encourages repeti-tion of desirable behaviors. your behavior that is unacceptable.\" An attitude of acceptance helps to promote the client's feelings of dignity and self-worth. Provide information to correct misconceptionsabout substance abuse. Client may rationalize hisor her behavior with statements such as, \"I'm notan alcoholic. I can stop drinking any time I want.Besides, I only drink beer.\" or \"I only smoke potto relax before class. So what? I know lots of peo-ple who do. Besides, you can't get hooked onpot.\" Many myths abound regarding use of spe-cific substances. Factual information presented ina matter-of-fact, nonjudgmental way explainingwhat behaviors constitute substance use disordersmay help the client focus on his or her own be-haviors as an illness that requires help. Identify recent maladaptive behaviors or situationsthat have occurred in the client's life, and discusshow use of substances may have been a contribut-ing factor. The first step in decreasing use of denialis for client to see the relationship between sub-stance use and personal problems. Use confrontation with caring. Do not allow clientto fantasize about his or her lifestyle. Confrontationinterferes with client's ability to use denial; a caringattitude preserves self-esteem and avoids puttingthe client on the defensive. CLINICAL PEARL It is important to speak objectively and nonjudgmentally to a person in denial. Examples: \"It is my understanding that the lasttime you drank alcohol, you . . .\" or \"The lab report shows thatyour blood alcohol level was 250 when you were involved in that automobile accident.\" Do not accept the use of rationalization or projec- tion as client attempts to make excuses for orblame his or her behavior on other people or situ-ations. Rationalization and projection prolong thestage of denial that problems exist in the client'slife because of substance use. 4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 399Encourage the client to verbalize feelings, fears, and anxieties. Answer any questions he or she mayhave regarding the disorder. Verbalization of feel-ings in a nonthreatening environment may helpthe client come to terms with long-unresolved issues. Explain the effects of substance abuse on the body.Emphasize that the prognosis is closely related to abstinence. Many clients lack knowledge regard-ing the deleterious effects of substance abuse onthe body. Explore with the client the options available to as-sist with stressful situations rather than resorting tosubstance use (e.g., contacting various members ofAlcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous;physical exercise; relaxation techniques; medita-tion). The client may have persistently resorted tochemical use and thus may possess little or noknowledge of adaptive responses to stress. Provide positive reinforcement for evidence ofgratification delayed appropriately. Encourage theclient to be as independent as possible in perform-ing his or her self-care. Provide positive feedbackfor independent decision-making and effective useof problem-solving skills. Dysfunctional Family Processes Dysfunctional family processes are defined as \"psychoso- cial, spiritual, and physiological functions of the fam-ily unit are chronically disorganized, which leads toconflict, denial of problems, resistance to change, ineffective problem solving, and a series of self-perpetuating crises\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 308). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goals Family members will participate in individual family programs and support groups. Family members will identify ineffective coping behaviors and consequences. Family will initiate and plan for necessary lifestylechanges. Long-Term Goal Family members will take action to change self-destructive behaviors and alter behaviors that con-tribute to client's addiction. Interventions Review family history; explore roles of family members, circumstances involving alcohol use,strengths, and areas of growth. Explore how familymembers have coped with the client's addiction (e.g.,denial, repression, rationalization, hurt, loneliness,projection). Persons who enable also suffer from thesame feelings as the client and use ineffective methodsfor dealing with the situation, necessitating help inlearning new and effective coping skills. Determine the family's understanding of the cur-rent situation and previous methods of coping withlife's problems. Assess family members' currentlevel of functioning. Determine the extent of enabling behaviors being ev-idenced by family members; explore with each indi-vidual and client. Enabling is doing for the client whathe or she needs to do for self (rescuing). People wantto be helpful and do not want to feel powerless to helptheir loved one to stop substance use and change thebehavior that is so destructive. However, the substanceabuser often relies on others to cover up for his or herinability to cope with daily responsibilities. Provide information about enabling behavior andaddictive disease characteristics for both the userand nonuser. Achieving awareness and knowledgeof behaviors (e.g., avoiding and shielding, takingover responsibilities, rationalizing, and subserving)provides an opportunity for individuals to beginthe process of change. Identify and discuss the possibility of sabotage be-haviors by family members. Even though familymember(s) may verbalize a desire for the individ-ual to become substance-free, the reality of inter-active dynamics is that they may unconsciously notwant the individual to recover, as this would affectthe family members' own role in the relationship.Additionally, they may receive sympathy or atten-tion from others (secondary gain). Assist the client's partner to understand that theclient's abstinence and drug use are not the partner'sresponsibility, and that the client's use of substancesmay or may not change despite involvement in treat-ment. Partners must come to realize and accept thatthe only behavior they can control is their own. Involve the family in plans for discharge from treat-ment. Alcohol abuse is a family illness. Because the family has been so involved in dealing with thesubstance use behavior, family members need help adjusting to the new behavior of sobriety/abstinence. Encourage involvement with self-helpassociations, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, Al-Anon, Alateen, and professional family therapy.This puts the client and family in direct contactwith support systems necessary for continued sobri-ety and assists with problem resolution. Concept Care Mapping The concept map care plan is an innovative approach toplanning and organizing nursing care (see Chapter 9).It is a diagrammatic teaching and learning strategy400 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 400that allows visualization of interrelationships between medical diagnoses, nursing diagnoses, assessmentdata, and treatments. An example of a concept mapcare plan for a client with a substance use disorder ispresented in Figure 23-4. Client/Family Education The role of client teacher is important in the psychi-atric area, as it is in all areas of nursing. A list of topicsfor client/family education relevant to substance-related disorders is presented in Box 23-5. Sampleclient teaching guides can be found online at www.davisplus.com. Evaluation The final step of the nursing process involves reassess-ment to determine if the nursing interventions havebeen effective in achieving the intended goals of care.CHAPTER 23 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 401 Clinical Vignette: John, age 56, was arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol. He ran a red light and caused an accident in which another person was injured. He was taken to the hospital and admitted to the alcohol anddrug detoxification unit. Following an unremarkable detoxification, he was transferred to the rehab unit. He says to thenurse, \"I don't have a problem with alcohol. I can quit any time I want to. Besides, what does it hurt?\" He tells thenurse that he has a very stressful job, and drinking alcohol helps him relax. He is pale and underweight for his height.He admits that sometimes he doesn't eat regular meals but instead drinks until he goes to sleep. His skin is dry andflaky. Laboratory results indicate evidence of malnutrition and dehydration. The nurse develops the following conceptmap care plan for John. Ineffective denialIneffective coping Deficient knowledge \"I don't have a problem with alcohol. I can quit any time I want to.\" Use of alcohol as a coping mechanism Unable to verbalize physiological effects of alcohol abuse \"What does it hurt?\" Accept client unconditionally Identify ways in which use of alcohol has contributed to maladaptive behaviors Do not allow client to blame others for behaviors associated with alcohol abuse Set limits on manipulative behavior Practice alternative, more adaptive coping strategies Give positive feedback for delaying gratification and using adaptive coping strategies Assess client's level of knowledge and readiness to learn Include significant others in teaching Provide information about physical effects of alcohol on body Teach about possibility of using disulfiram Verbalizes correlation between use of alcohol and personal problems Accepts responsibility for own behaviors Verbalizes and demonstrates adaptive coping strategies as alternatives to alcohol use in response to stress Verbalizes effects of alcohol on body Verbalizes knowledge about use of medication to assist with abstinenceSigns and SymptomsSigns and SymptomsSigns and Symptoms Nursing DiagnosisNursing DiagnosisNursing Diagnosis Nursing Actions Nursing Actions Nursing Actions Outcomes OutcomesImbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements Dry skin Pale Underweight Lab reports positive for malnutrition Consult dietitian I&O and daily weights Monitor protein intake of client with impaired liver function Restrict sodium intake to minimize fluid retention Provide small, frequent feedings of nonirritating foods Vital signs, blood pressure, and lab values are within normal limits Verbalizes importance of adequate nutritionSigns and Symptoms Nursing Diagnosis Nursing Actions Outcomes Outcomes FIGURE 23-4 Concept map care plan for client with alcohol use disorder.4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 401402 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation Evaluation of the client with a substance-related dis- order may be accomplished by using informationgathered from the following reassessment questions: Has detoxification occurred without complications? Is the client still in denial? Does the client accept responsibility for his or herown behavior? Has he or she acknowledged a per-sonal problem with substances? Has a correlation been made between personalproblems and the use of substances? Does the client still make excuses or blame othersfor use of substances? Has the client remained substance-free during hospitalization? Does the client cooperate with treatment? Does the client refrain from manipulative behaviorand violation of limits? Is the client able to verbalize alternative adaptivecoping strategies to substitute for substance use?Has the use of these strategies been demonstrated?Does positive reinforcement encourage repetitionof these adaptive behaviors? Has nutritional status been restored? Does theclient consume diet adequate for his or her sizeand level of activity? Is the client able to discuss theimportance of adequate nutrition? Has the client remained free of infection duringhospitalization? Is the client able to verbalize the effects of sub-stance abuse on the body? Does the client verbalize that he or she wants to recover and lead a life free of substances? The Chemically-Impaired Nurse Substance abuse and addiction is a problem that hasthe potential for impairment in an individual's social,occupational, psychological, and physical function-ing. This becomes an especially serious problem whenthe impaired person is responsible for the lives of others on a daily basis. Approximately 10 percent ofthe general population suffers from the disease ofchemical addiction. It is estimated that 10 to 15 per-cent of nurses suffer from this disease (Thomas &Siela, 2011). Alcohol is the most widely abused drug,followed closely by narcotics. For years, the impaired nurse was protected, promoted, transferred, ignored, or fired. These typesof responses promoted the growth of the problem.Programs are needed that involve early reporting andtreatment of chemical addiction as a disease, with afocus on public safety and rehabilitation of the nurse. How does one identify the impaired nurse? It is still easiest to overlook what might be a problem. Denial, on the part of the impaired nurse as well as nurse col-leagues, is still the strongest defense for dealing withsubstance-abuse problems. Some states have manda-tory reporting laws that require observers to reportsubstance-abusing nurses to the state board of nurs-ing. They are difficult laws to enforce, and hospitalsare not always compliant with mandatory reporting.Some hospitals may choose not to report to the stateboard of nursing if the impaired nurse is actively seek-ing treatment and is not placing clients in danger. A number of clues for recognizing substance impairment in nurses have been identified (Ellis &Hartley, 2012; Thomas & Siela, 2011). They are noteasy to detect and will vary according to the substancebeing used. There may be high absenteeism if theperson's source is outside the work area, or the indi-vidual may rarely miss work if the substance source isat work. There may be an increase in \"wasting\" ofdrugs, higher incidences of incorrect narcotic counts,and a higher record of signing out drugs than forother nurses. Poor concentration, difficulty meeting deadlines, inappropriate responses, and poor memory or recallare usually late in the disease process. The personmay also have problems with relationships.

He orshe may frequently medicate other nurses' patients,and there may be patient complaints of inadequatepain control. Discrepancies in documentation mayoccur. If suspicious behavior occurs, it is important to keep careful, objective records. Confrontation withthe impaired nurse will undoubtedly result in hostilityand denial. Confrontation should occur in the pres-ence of a supervisor or other nurse and should in-clude the offer of assistance in seeking treatment. If areport is made to the state board of nursing, it shouldbe a factual documentation of specific events and actions, not a diagnostic statement of impairment. What will the state board do? Each case is generally decided on an individual basis. A state board may deny,suspend, or revoke a license based on a report of chem-ical abuse by a nurse. Several state boards of nursinghave passed diversionary laws that allow impairednurses to avoid disciplinary action by agreeing to seektreatment. Some of these state boards administer thetreatment programs themselves, and others refer thenurse to community resources or state nurses' associa-tion assistance programs. This may require successfulcompletion of inpatient, outpatient, group, or individ-ual counseling treatment program(s); evidence of reg-ular attendance at nurse support groups or 12-stepprogram; random negative drug screens; and employ-ment or volunteer activities during the suspension period. When a nurse is deemed safe to return to prac-tice, he or she may be closely monitored for severalyears and required to undergo random drug screen-ings. The nurse also may be required to practice underspecifically circumscribed conditions for a designatedperiod of time. In 1982, the American Nurses Association (ANA) House of Delegates adopted a national resolution toprovide assistance to impaired nurses. Since that time,the majority of state nurses' associations have devel-oped (or are developing) programs for nurses whoare impaired by substances or psychiatric illness. Theindividuals who administer these efforts are nursemembers of the state associations, as well as nurseswho are in recovery themselves. For this reason, theyare called peer assistance programs . The peer assistance programs strive to intervene early, to reduce hazards to clients, and increaseprospects for the nurse's recovery. Most states provideeither a hotline number that the impaired nurse orintervening colleague may call or phone numbers ofpeer assistance committee members, which are madeavailable for the same purpose. Typically, a contractis drawn up detailing the method of treatment, whichmay be obtained from various sources, such as em-ployee assistance programs, Alcoholics Anonymous,Narcotics Anonymous, private counseling, or outpa-tient clinics. Guidelines for monitoring the course oftreatment are established. Peer support is providedthrough regular contact with the impaired nurse, usu-ally for a period of 2 years. Peer assistance programsserve to assist impaired nurses to recognize their impairment, to obtain necessary treatment, and to regain accountability within their profession. Codependency The concept of codependency arose out of a need to define the dysfunctional behaviors that are evidentamong members of the family of a chemically addicted person. The term has been expanded to include all individuals from families that harbor secrets of physical or emotional abuse, other cruelties,or pathological conditions. Living under these condi-tions results in unmet needs for autonomy and self-esteem and a profound sense of powerlessness. Thecodependent person is able to achieve a sense of control only through fulfilling the needs of others.Personal identity is relinquished and boundaries withthe other person become blurred. The codependentperson disowns his or her own needs and wants in order to respond to external demands and the demands of others. Codependence has been called\"a dysfunctional relationship with oneself.\" The traits associated with a codependent person- ality are varied. A codependent individual is confusedabout his or her own identity. In a relationship, thecodependent person derives self-worth from that ofthe partner, whose feelings and behaviors determinehow the codependent should feel and behave. Inorder for the codependent to feel good, his or herpartner must be happy and behave in appropriateways. If the partner is not happy, the codependentfeels responsible for making him or her happy. The codependent's home life is fraught with stress. Egoboundaries are weak and behaviors are often en-meshed with those of the pathological partner. Denialthat problems exist is common. Feelings are kept incontrol, and anxiety may be released in the form ofstress-related illnesses or compulsive behaviors suchas eating, spending, working, or use of substances. Wesson (2013) describes the following behaviors characteristic of codependency. She stated that code-pendents: Have a long history of focusing thoughts and behavior on other people.CHAPTER 23 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 4034092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 403Are \"people pleasers\" and will do almost anything to get the approval of others. Outwardly appear very competent, but actually feelquite needy, helpless, or perhaps nothing at all. Have experienced abuse or emotional neglect as achild. Are outwardly focused towards others, and knowvery little about how to direct their own lives fromtheir own sense of self. The Codependent Nurse Certain characteristics of codependence have beenassociated with the profession of nursing. A shortageof nurses combined with the increasing ranks of seri-ously ill clients may result in nurses providing careand fulfilling everyone's needs but their own. Manyhealth-care workers who are reared in homes with achemically addicted person or otherwise dysfunc-tional family are at risk for having any unresolvedcodependent tendencies activated. Nurses, who aschildren assumed the \"fixer\" role in their dysfunc-tional families of origin, may attempt to resume thatrole in their caregiving professions. They are attractedto a profession in which they are needed, but theynurture feelings of resentment for receiving so littlein return. Their emotional needs go unmet; however,they continue to deny that these needs exist. Instead,these unmet emotional needs may be manifestedthrough use of compulsive behaviors, such as work orspending excessively, or addictions, such as to food orsubstances. Codependent nurses have a need to be in control. They often strive for an unrealistic level of achieve-ment. Their self-worth comes from the feeling ofbeing needed by others and of maintaining controlover their environment. They nurture the depend-ence of others and accept the responsibility for thehappiness and contentment of others. They rarely express their true feelings, and do what is necessaryto preserve harmony and maintain control. They areat high risk for physical and emotional burnout. Treating Codependency Cermak (1986) identified four stages in the recoveryprocess for individuals with codependent personality: Stage I: The Survival Stage In this first stage, codepen- dent persons must begin to let go of the denial that problems exist or that their personal capabilities areunlimited. This initiation of abstinence from blanketdenial may be a very emotional and painful period. Stage II: The Reidentification Stage Reidentification occurs when the individuals are able to glimpse theirtrue selves through a break in the denial system. Theyaccept the label of codependent and take responsibilityfor their own dysfunctional behavior. Codependents tend to enter reidentification only after being con-vinced that it is more painful not to. They accept their limitations and are ready to face the issues ofcodependence. Stage III: The Core Issues Stage In this stage, the recover- ing codependent must face the fact that relationships cannot be managed by force of will. Each partner mustbe independent and autonomous. The goal of this stageis to detach from the struggles of life that exist becauseof prideful and willful efforts to control those things thatare beyond the individual's power to control. Stage IV : The Reintegration Stage This is a stage of self- acceptance and willingness to change when codepen-dents relinquish the power over others that was not rightfully theirs but reclaim the personal power that they do possess. Integrity is achieved out of awareness,honesty, and being in touch with one's spiritual con-sciousness. Control is achieved through self-disciplineand self-confidence. Self-help groups have been found to be helpful in the treatment of codependency. Groups developedfor families of chemically addicted people, such as Al-Anon, may be of assistance. Groups specific to theproblem of codependency also exist. One of thesegroups, which bases its philosophy on the TwelveSteps of Alcoholics Anonymous (see the section thatfollows), is: Modalities for Substance-Related Disorders Alcoholics Anonymous Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a major self-help or- ganization for the treatment of alcoholism. It was founded in 1935 by two alcoholics\u2014a stockbroker,Bill Wilson, and a physician, Dr. Bob Smith\u2014who dis-covered that they could remain sober through mutualsupport. This they accomplished not as professionals,but as peers who were able to share their common experiences. Soon they were working with other alco-holics, who in turn worked with others. The move-ment grew, and remarkably, individuals who had beentreated unsuccessfully by professionals were able tomaintain sobriety through helping one another. Today AA chapters exist in virtually every commu- nity in the United States. The self-help groups arebased on the concept of peer support\u2014acceptanceand understanding from others who have experienced404 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 404the same problems in their lives. The only require- ment for membership is a desire on the part of the alcoholic person to stop drinking. Each new memberis assigned a support person from whom he or she mayseek assistance when the temptation to drink occurs. A survey by the General Service Office of Alco- holics Anonymous in 2011 (Alcoholics Anonymous[AA], 2012) revealed the following statistics: membersages 30 and younger comprised 13 percent of themembership and the average age of AA members was49; women comprised 35 percent; 87 percent werewhite, 4 percent were African American, 5 percentwere Hispanic, 2 percent were Native American, and2 percent were Asian American and other minorities.By occupation, the highest percentages included thefollowing: 17 percent were retired; 10 percent wereself-employed; 10 percent were unemployed; 9 per-cent were managers or administrators; and 8 percentwere in professional or technical fields. The sole purpose of AA is to help members stay sober. When sobriety has been achieved, they in turnare expected to help other alcoholic persons. TheTwelve Steps that embody the philosophy of AA pro-vide specific guidelines on how to attain and maintainsobriety (Box 23-6). AA accepts alcoholism as an illness and promotes total abstinence as the only cure, emphasizing thatthe alcoholic person can never safely return to social CHAPTER 23 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 405 BOX 23-6 Alcoholics Anonymous THE TWELVE STEPS 1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol\u2014that our lives have become unmanageable. 2 . Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. 3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him. 4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. 5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. 6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character. 7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings. 8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all. 9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible except when to do so would injure them or others. 10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it. 11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and thepower to carry that out. 12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics andto practice these principles in all our affairs.THE TWELVE TRADITIONS 1. Our common welfare should come first; personal recov- ery depends upon A A unity. 2. For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority\u2014 a loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they donot govern. 3. The one requirement for AA membership is a desire to stop drinking. 4. Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or AA as a whole. 5. Each group has but one primary purpose\u2014to carry its message to the alcoholic who still suffers. 6. An AA group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the AA name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lestproblems of money, property, and prestige divert usfrom our primary purpose. 7. Every AA group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions. 8. Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever nonpro- fessional, but our service centers may employ specialworkers. 9. Alcoholics Anonymous, as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards of committees directlyresponsible to those they serve. 10. Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside is- sues; hence, the Alcoholics Anonymous name oughtnever be drawn into public controversy. 11. Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personalanonymity at the level of press, radio, and films. 12. Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.

They encourage the members to seek sobri- ety, taking one day at a time. The Twelve Traditionsare the statements of principles that govern the or-ganization (see Box 23-6). AA has been the model for various other self-help groups associated with addiction problems. Some ofthese groups and the memberships for which they areorganized are listed in Table 23-11. Nurses need to befully and accurately informed about available self-helpgroups and their importance as a treatment resourceon the health-care continuum so that they can usethem as a referral source for clients with substanceuse disorders. Pharmacotherapy Disulfiram (Antabuse) Disulfiram that can be adminis- tered as a deterrent to drinking to individuals whoabuse alcohol. Ingestion of alcohol while disulfiramis in the body results in a syndrome of symptoms thatcan produce a great deal of discomfort for the indi-vidual. It can even result in death if the blood alcohollevel is high. The reaction varies according to the sen-sitivity of the individual and how much alcohol wasingested. Disulfiram works by inhibiting the enzyme alde- hyde dehydrogenase, thereby blocking the oxidationof alcohol at the stage when acetaldehyde is con-verted to acetate. This results in an accumulation ofacetaldehyde in the blood, which is thought to pro-duce the symptoms associated with the disulfiram-alcohol reaction. These symptoms persist as long asalcohol is being metabolized. The rate of alcoholelimination does not appear to be affected. Symptoms of disulfiram-alcohol reaction can occur within 5 to 10 minutes of ingestion of alcohol. Mildreactions can occur at blood alcohol levels as low as 5 to 10 mg/dL. Symptoms are fully developed at ap-proximately 50 mg/dL, and may include flushed skin,throbbing in the head and neck, respiratory difficulty,dizziness, nausea and vomiting, sweating, hyperventi-lation, tachycardia, hypotension, weakness, blurred vision, and confusion. With a blood alcohol level ofapproximately 125 to 150 mg/dL, severe reactionscan occur, including respiratory depression, cardio-vascular collapse, arrhythmias, infarction,acute congestive heart failure, unconsciousness, con-vulsions, and death. Disulfiram should not be administered until it has been ascertained that the client has abstained fromalcohol for at least 12 hours. If disulfiram is discon-tinued, it is important for the client to understandthat the sensitivity to alcohol may last for as long as 2 weeks. Consuming alcohol or alcohol-containing406 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation TABLE 23-11 Addiction Self-Help Groups GROUP MEMBERSHIP Adult Children of for SobrietyAdults who grew up with an alcoholic in the homeFamilies of alcoholicsAdolescent children of alcoholicsSchool-age children with an alcoholic family memberCocaine addictsParents of children 2-week period could result in the disulfiram-alcohol reaction. The client receiving disulfiram therapy should be aware of the large number of alcohol-containingsubstances. These products, such as liquid cough andcold preparations, vanilla extract, aftershave lotions,colognes, mouthwash, nail polish removers, and iso-propyl alcohol, if ingested or even rubbed on theskin, are capable of producing the symptoms de-scribed. The individual must read labels carefully andmust inform any doctor, dentist, or other health-careprofessional from whom assistance is sought that heor she is taking disulfiram. In addition, it is importantthat the client carry a card explaining participationin disulfiram therapy, possible consequences of thetherapy, and symptoms that may indicate an emer-gency situation. The client must be assessed carefully before begin- ning disulfiram therapy. A thorough medical screen-ing is performed before starting therapy, and writteninformed consent is usually required. The drug iscontraindicated for clients who are at high risk for al-cohol ingestion. It is also contraindicated for psy-chotic clients and clients with severe cardiac, renal,or hepatic disease. Disulfiram therapy is not a cure for alcoholism. It provides a measure of control for the individual whodesires to avoid impulse drinking. Clients receivingdisulfiram therapy are encouraged to seek other assistance with their problem, such as AA or othersupport group, to aid in the recovery process. Other Medications for Treatment of Alcoholism The narcotic antagonist naltrexone (ReVia) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration(FDA) in 1994 for the treatment of alcohol addiction.Naltrexone, which was approved in 1984 for the treat-ment of heroin abuse, works on the same receptors inthe brain that produce the feelings of pleasure whenheroin or other opiates bind to them, but it does notproduce the \"narcotic high\" and is not habit forming.Although alcohol does not bind to these same brainreceptors, studies have shown that naltrexone worksequally well against it (O'Malley et al., 1992; Volpicelli,Alterman, Hayashida, & O'Brien, 1992). In compari-son to the placebo-treated clients, subjects on naltrex-one therapy showed significantly lower overall relapserates and fewer drinks per drinking day among thoseclients who did resume drinking. A study with an oralform of nalmefene (Revex) produced similar results(Mason et al., 1994). Research on the efficacy of selective serotonin re- uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in decreasing alcohol crav-ing among alcohol-dependent individuals has yieldedmixed results (National Institute on Alcohol Abuseand Alcoholism [NIAAA], 2000). A greater degree ofsuccess was observed with moderate drinkers thanwith heavy drinkers. In August 2004, the FDA approved acamprosate (Campral), which is indicated for the maintenance ofabstinence from alcohol in patients with alcohol addiction who are abstinent at treatment initiation.The mechanism of action of acamprosate in mainte-nance of alcohol abstinence is not completely under-stood. It is hypothesized to restore the normal balancebetween neuronal neurotransmitter systems. Acamprosate is ineffective in clients who have not undergone detoxi-fication and not achieved alcohol abstinence prior tobeginning treatment. It is recommended for concomi-tant use with psychosocial therapy. Counseling Counseling on a one-to-one basis is often used to helpthe client who abuses substances. The relationship isgoal-directed, and the length of the counseling mayvary from weeks to years. The focus is on current reality,development of a working treatment relationship, andstrengthening ego assets. The counselor must be warm,kind, and nonjudgmental, yet able to set limits firmly.Research consistently demonstrates that personal char-acteristics of counselors are highly predictive of clientoutcome. In addition to technical counseling skills,many important therapeutic qualities affect the out-come of counseling, including insight, respect, gen-uineness, concreteness, and empathy (SAMHSA, 2009). Counseling of the client who abuses substances passes through various phases, each of which is of in-determinate length. In the first phase, an assessmentis conducted. Factual data are collected to determinewhether the client does indeed have a problem withsubstances; that is, that substances are regularly im-pairing effective functioning in a significant life area. Following the assessment, in the working phase of the relationship, the counselor assists the individualto work on acceptance of the fact that the use of sub-stances causes problems in significant life areas andthat he or she is not able to prevent it from occurring.The client states a desire to make changes. Thestrength of the denial system is determined by the du-ration and extent of substance-related adverse effectsin the person's life. Thus, those individuals withrather minor substance-related problems of recentorigin have less difficulty with this stage than thosewith long-term extensive impairment. The individualalso works to gain self-control and abstain from substances. Once the problem has been identified and sobriety is achieved, the client must have a concrete and CHAPTER 23 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 4074092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 407workable plan for getting through the early weeks of abstinence. Anticipatory guidance through role-playhelps the individual practice how he or she will re-spond when substances are readily obtainable and theimpulse to partake is strong. Counseling often includes the family or specific family members. In family counseling the therapisttries to help each member see how he or she has affected, and been affected by, the substance abuse be-havior. Family strengths are mobilized, and familymembers are encouraged to move in a positive direc-tion. Referrals are often made to self-help groups suchas Al-Anon, Nar-Anon, Alateen, Families Anonymous,and Adult Children of Alcoholics. Group Therapy Group therapy with substance abusers has long beenregarded as a powerful agent of change. In groups,individuals are able to share their experiences withothers who are going through similar problems. Theyare able to \"see themselves in others,\" and confronttheir defenses about giving up the substance. Theymay confront similar attitudes and defenses in others.Groups also give individuals the capacity for commu-nicating needs and feelings directly. Some groups may be task-oriented education groups in which the leader is charged with presentingmaterial associated with substance abuse and its vari-ous effects on the person's life. Other educationalgroups that may be helpful with individuals whoabuse substances include assertiveness techniquesand relaxation training. Teaching groups differ frompsychotherapy groups, whose focus is more on help-ing individuals understand and manage difficult feel-ings and situations, particularly as they relate to useof substances. Therapy groups and self-help groups such as AA are complementary to each other. Whereas the self-helpgroup focus is on achieving and maintaining sobriety,in the therapy group the individual may learn moreadaptive ways of coping, how to deal with problemsthat may have arisen or were exacerbated by the for-mer substance use, and ways to improve quality of lifeand to function more effectively without substances. Psychopharmacology for Substance Intoxication and Substance Withdrawal Various medications have been used to decrease the intensity of symptoms in an individual who is with-drawing from, or who is experiencing the effects of ex-cessive use of, alcohol and other drugs. Substitution therapy may be required to reduce the life-threatening effects of intoxication or withdrawal from some sub-stances. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome depends on the particular drug used, how long it hasbeen used, the dose used, and the rate at which thedrug is eliminated from the body. Alcohol Benzodiazepines are the most widely used group ofdrugs for substitution therapy in alcohol withdrawal.Chlordiazepoxide (Ativan), and diazepam used agents. The approach to treat-ment with benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal isto start with relatively high doses and reduce thedosage by 20 to 25 percent each day until withdrawalis complete. Additional doses may be given for break-through signs or symptoms (Black & Andreasen,2011). In clients with liver disease, accumulation of the longer-acting agents (chlordiazepoxide and diazepam) may be problematic, and use of the shorter-acting benzodiazepines (lorazepam or oxazepam) ismore tion (e.g., carbamazepine, valproic acid, or gabapentin)for management of withdrawal seizures. These drugsare particularly useful in individuals who undergo re-peated episodes of alcohol withdrawal. Repeatedepisodes of withdrawal appear to \"kindle\" even moreserious withdrawal episodes, including the productionof withdrawal seizures that can result in brain damage(Julien, 2008). These anticonvulsants have been usedsuccessfully in both acute withdrawal and longer-termcraving situations. Multivitamin therapy, in combination with daily injections or oral administration of thiamine, is com-mon protocol. Thiamine is commonly deficient inchronic alcoholics. Replacement therapy is required toprevent neuropathy, confusion, and encephalopathy. Opioids Examples of With short-acting drugssuch as heroin, withdrawal symptoms occur within 6 to 8 hours after the last dose, peak within 1 to 3 days,and gradually subside over a period of 5 to 7 days (Walton-Moss et al., 2010). With longer-acting drugssuch as methadone, withdrawal symptoms beginwithin 1 to 3 days after the last dose, peak between days4 and 6, and are complete in 14 to 21 days (Leamonet al., 2008). Withdrawal from the ultra-short-actingmeperidine begins quickly, reaches a peak in 8 to 12 hours, and is complete in 4 to 5 days (Sadock &Sadock, 2007). Opioid intoxication is therapy includes408 UNIT of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 408rest, adequate nutritional support, and methadone substitution. Methadone is given on the first day in adose sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms. Thedose is then gradually tapered over a specified time. Asthe dose of methadone diminishes, renewed absti-nence symptoms may be ameliorated by the additionof clonidine. In October 2002, the FDA approved two forms of the drug buprenorphine for treating opiate addiction.Buprenorphine is less powerful than methadone but isconsidered to be somewhat safer and causes fewer sideeffects, making it especially attractive for clients who aremildly or moderately addicted. Individuals are able toaccess treatment with buprenorphine in office-basedsettings, providing an alternative to methadone clinics.Physicians are deemed qualified to prescribe buprenor-phine if they hold an addiction certification from theAmerican Society of Addiction Medicine, the AmericanAcademy of Addiction Psychiatry, the American Psychi-atric Association, or other associations deemed appro-priate. The number of patients to whom individualphysicians may provide outpatient buprenorphinetreatment is limited to 100 (Gordon, 2009). A sub-lingual formulation of a combination medication(buprenorphine and naloxone) is also available. Clonidine (Catapres) also has been used to sup- press opiate withdrawal symptoms. As monotherapy,it is not as effective as substitution with methadone,but it is nonaddicting and serves effectively as a bridgeto enable the client to stay opiate free long enoughto facilitate termination of methadone maintenance. Depressants Substitution therapy for CNS depressant withdrawal(particularly most commonly with thelong-acting barbiturate phenobarbital (Luminal). Thedosage required to suppress withdrawal symptoms isadministered. When stabilization has been achieved,the dose is gradually decreased by 30 mg/day untilwithdrawal is complete. Long-acting benzodiazepinesare commonly used for substitution therapy when theabused substance is a nonbarbiturate CNS depressant(Ashton, 2002). Stimulants Treatment of stimulant intoxication usually minor tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide andprogresses to major tranquilizers such as haloperidol(Haldol). Antipsychotics should be administered withcaution because of their propensity to lower seizurethreshold (Mack et al., 2003). Repeated seizures aretreated with intravenous diazepam. Withdrawal from CNS stimulants is not the medical emergency observed with CNS depressants. Treat-ment is usually aimed at reducing drug craving andmanaging severe depression. The client is placed ina quiet atmosphere and allowed to sleep and eat asmuch as is needed or desired. Suicide precautionsmay need to be instituted. Antidepressant therapymay be helpful in treating symptoms of depression.Desipramine has been especially successful with symp-toms of cocaine withdrawal and abstinence (Mack et al., 2003). Hallucinogens and Cannabinoids Substitution therapy is not required with these drugs.When adverse reactions, such as anxiety or panic,occur, benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam or chlor-diazepoxide) may be prescribed to prevent harm tothe client or others. Psychotic reactions may be treatedwith antipsychotic medications. Non-Substance Addictions Gambling Disorder This disorder is defined by the DSM- 5as persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior lead-ing to clinically significant impairment or distress(APA, 2013). The preoccupation with and impulse togamble often intensifies when the individual is understress. Many impulsive gamblers describe a physicalsensation of restlessness and anticipation that canonly be relieved by placing a bet. Blume (2013) states: In some cases the initial change in gambling behavior leading to pathological gambling begins with a \"bigwin,\" bringing a rapid development of preoccupa-tion, tolerance, and loss of control. Winning bringsfeelings of special status, power, and omnipotence.The gambler increasingly depends on this activity tocope with disappointments, problems, and negativeemotional states, pulling away from emotional attach-ment to family and friends. As the need to gamble increases, the individual is forced to obtain money by any means available. This may include borrowing money from illegal sources orpawning personal items (or items that belong to oth-ers). As gambling debts accrue, or out of a need tocontinue gambling, the individual may desperately resort to forgery, theft, or even embezzlement. Familyrelationships are disrupted, and impairment in occu-pational functioning may occur because of absencesfrom work in order to gamble. Gambling behavior usually begins in adolescence; however, compulsive behaviors rarely occur beforeyoung adulthood. The disorder generally runs achronic course, with periods of waxing and waning,largely dependent on periods of psychosocial stress.Prevalence estimates for pathological gambling rangefrom 1.2 percent to 3.4 percent (Hollander, Berlin, &Stein, 2008). It is more common among men thanwomen.CHAPTER 23 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 4094092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 409Various personality traits have been attributed to pathological gamblers. Unwin, Davis, and Leeuw (2000) stated: Evidence points to the common existence of narcissis- tic personality characteristics and impulse controlproblems in pathologic gamblers. High rates of per-sonality disorders (e.g., obsessive-compulsive, avoidant,schizotypal and paranoid) are noted in several studies.Personality profiles of persons who are alcoholics andpathologic gamblers are also similar in some studies.Some experts view pathologic gambling as an addictivedisorder, citing as evidence the tolerance and with-drawal symptoms exhibited by pathologic gamblers because of debt escalation behaviors. However, nophysical or biochemical markers exist to help physi-cians make the diagnosis. (p. 744) The DSM-5 suggests that gambling behavior can be episodic or chronic and vary by type and life circum- stances. The following example is cited (APA, 2012): An individual who wagers problematically only on football games may have Gambling Disorder duringfootball season and not wager at all, or not wagerproblematically, throughout the remainder of theyear. Gambling Disorder may also occur at one ormore points in an individual's life, but be absent dur-ing other periods. Alternately, some individuals expe-rience chronic Gambling Disorder throughout all ormost of their lives. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for pathological gam- bling are presented in Box 23-7. Predisposing Factors to Gambling Disorder Biological Influences Genetic Familial and twin studies show an increased prevalence of pathological gambling in family members of individuals diagnosed with the disorder. Hollanderand associates (2008) report the results of research thatindicates a common genetic vulnerability for patholog-ical gambling and alcohol addiction in men. Physiological Hodgins, Stea, and Grant (2011) suggest a correlation between pathological gambling and ab- normalities in the serotonergic, noradrenergic, anddopaminergic neurotransmitter systems. They stated: Dopamine is implicated in learning, motivation, and the salience of stimuli, including rewards. Alterations410 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation BOX 23-7 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder A. Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicate d by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: 1. Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. 2. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. 3. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. 4. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, or thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). 5. Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). 6. After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). 7. Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. 8. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. 9. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. B. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode. Specify if: Episodic: meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years.Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer.

(p. 1878) Other studies have indicated alterations in the elec- troencephalographic of Influences Sadock (2007) report that the following maybe predisposing factors to the development of patholog-ical gambling: \"loss of a parent by death, separation, divorce, or desertion before the child is 15 years of age;inappropriate parental discipline (absence, inconsis-tency, or harshness); exposure to and availability of gam-bling activities for the adolescent; a family emphasis onmaterial and financial symbols; and a lack of family emphasis on saving, planning, and budgeting\" (p. 779). The early psychoanalytical view attempted to explain compulsive gambling in terms of psychosexual matura-tion. In this theory, the gambling is compared to mas-turbation; both of these activities derive motive forcefrom a buildup of tension that is released throughrepetitive actions or the anticipation of them. Anotherview suggests a masochistic component to pathologicalgambling and the gambler's inherent need for punish-ment, which is then achieved through losing (Moreyra,Ibanez, Saiz-Ruiz, Nissenson, & Blanco, 2000).Treatment Modalities for Gambling Disorder Because most pathological gamblers deny that theyhave a problem, treatment is difficult. In fact, mostgamblers only seek treatment due to legal difficulties,family pressures, or other psychiatric complaints. Be-havior therapy, cognitive therapy, and psychoanalysishave been used with pathological gambling, with var-ious degrees of success (Moreyra et al., 2000). Some medications have been used with effective results in the treatment of pathological gambling.The SSRIs and clomipramine have been used success-fully in the treatment of pathological gambling as aform of disorder (Moreyra et al.,2000). Lithium, carbamazepine, and naltrexone havealso been shown to be effective. Possibly the most effective treatment of pathologi- cal gambling is participation by the individual inGamblers Anonymous (GA). This organization of in- spirational group therapy is modeled after AlcoholicsAnonymous. The only requirement for GA member-ship is an expressed desire to stop gambling. Treat-ment is based on peer pressure, public confession,and the availability of other reformed gamblers tohelp individuals resist the urge to gamble. Gam-Anon(for family and spouses of compulsive gamblers) andGam-a-Teen (for adolescent children of compulsivegamblers) are also important sources of treatment.CHAPTER 23 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders 411 CASE STUDY AND SAMPLE CARE PLAN NURSING HISTORY AND ASSESSMENT The police bring Dan to the emergency department of the local hospital around 9 p.m. His wife, Carol, called 911 whenDan became violent and she began to fear for her safety.Dan was fired from his job as a foreman in a manufacturingplant for refusing to follow his supervisor's directions on aproject. When cleaning up after his move, several partiallyused bottles of liquor were found in his work area. Carol reports that Dan has been drinking since he came home shortly after noon today. He bloodied hernose and punched her in the stomach when she pouredthe contents of a bottle from which he was drinking downthe kitchen sink. The police responded to her call andbrought Dan to the hospital in handcuffs. By the time theyarrive at the hospital, Dan has calmed down, and appearsdrugged and drowsy. His blood alcohol level measures247 mg/dL. He is admitted to the detoxification unit ofthe hospital with a diagnosis of alcohol intoxication. Carol tells the admitting nurse that she and Dan have been married for 12 years. He was a social drinker beforethey were married, but his drinking has increased over theyears. He has been under a lot of stress at work, hates hisjob, his boss, and his coworkers, and is depressed a lot of thetime. He never had a loving relationship with his parents, whoare now deceased. For the past few years, his pattern has beento come home, start drinking immediately, and drink until hepasses out for the night. She states that she has tried to gethim to go for help with his drinking, but he refuses, and saysthat he doesn't have a problem. Carol begins to cry and saysto the nurse, \"We can't go on like this. I don't know what to do!\" NURSING DIAGNOSES/OUTCOME IDENTIFICATION From the assessment data, the nurse develops the following nursing diagnoses for Dan: 1.Risk for injury related to CN S ag itation from alcohol withdrawal. a. Short-Term Goal: Dan's condition will stabilize within 72 hours. b. Long-Term Goal: Dan will not experience physical injury. 2.Ineffective denial related to low self-esteem, weak ego development, and underlying fears and anxieties. a. Short-Term Goal: Dan will focus immediate attention on behavioral changes required to achieve sobriety. b. Long-Term Goal: Dan will accept responsibility for his drinking behaviors, and acknowledge the association between his drinking and personal problems.

Substance intoxication is defined as the develop-ment of a reversible syndrome of maladaptive behavioral or psychological changes that are dueto the direct physiological effects of a substance onthe CNS and develop during or shortly after inges-tion of (or exposure to) a substance.Substance withdrawal is the development of a sub-stance-specific maladaptive behavioral change, withphysiological and cognitive concomitants, that isdue to the cessation of, or reduction in, heavy andprolonged substance use. The etiology of substance use disorders is un-known. Various contributing factors have been implicated, such as genetics, biochemical changes,developmental influences, personality factors, social learning, conditioning, and cultural and eth-nic influences. Seven classes of substances are presented in thischapter in terms of a profile of the substance, his-torical aspects, patterns of use, and effects on thebody. They include alcohol, other CNS depressants,412 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation CASE STUDY AND SAMPLE CARE PLAN\u2014cont'd PLANNING/IMPLEMENTATION RISK FOR INJURY The following nursing interventions may be implemented in an effort to ensure client safety: 1.Assess his level of disorientation; frequently orient him to reality and his surroundings. 2.Obtain a drug history. 3.Obtain a urine sample for analysis. 4.Place Dan in a quiet room (private, if possible). 5.Ensure that smoking materials and other potentiallyharmful objects are stored away . 6.Observe Dan frequently . Take vital signs every 15 to 30 minutes. 7.Monitor for signs of withdrawal within a few hours afteradmission. W atch for signs of: Increased heart rate Tremors Headache Diaphoresis Agitation; restlessness Nausea Fever Convulsions 8.Follow medication regimen, as ordered by physician(commonly a benzodiazepine, thiamine, multivitamin). INEFFECTIVE DENIAL The following nursing interventions may be implementedin an effort to help Dan accept responsibility for the behavioral consequences associated with hisdrinking:1.Develop Dan's trust by spending time with him, beinghonest, and keeping all promises. 2.Ensure that Dan understands that it is not him,but his behavior , that is unacceptable. 3.Provide Dan with accurate information about the effectsof alcohol. Do this in a matter-of-fact, nonjudgmental way .4.P oint out recent negative events that have occurred in Dan's life, and associate the use of alcohol with theseevents. Help him to see the association. 5.Use confrontation with caring: \"Yes, your wife called thepolice. Y ou were physically abusive. She was afraid. And your blood alcohol level was 2 47 when you were brought in. You were obviously not in control of your behavior atthe time.\" 6.Don't accept excuses for his drinking. Point out rationali-zation and projection behaviors. T hese behaviors prolong denial that he has a problem. He must directly accept re-sponsibility for his drinking (not make excuses and blameit on the behavior of others). He must come to under-stand that only H E has control of his behavior. 7.Encourage Dan to attend group therapy during treatment,and Alcoholics Anonymous following treatment. P eer feedback is a strong factor in helping individuals recog-nize their problems and to ultimately remain sober . 8.Encourage Carol to attend Al-Anon meetings. She canbenefit from the experiences of others who have experi-enced and are experiencing the same types of problemsas she. 9.Help Dan to identify ways that he can cope besides usingalcohol (e.g., exercise, spor ts, rela xation). He should choose what is most appropriate for him, and should begiven positive feedback for efforts made toward change. EVALUATION The outcome criteria identified for Dan have been met. Heexperienced an uncomplicated withdrawal from alcohol andexhibits no evidence of physical injury. He verbalizes under-standing of the relationship between his personal problemsand his drinking, and accepts responsibility for his own be-havior. He verbalizes understanding that alcohol addictionis an illness that requires ongoing support and treatment,and regularly attends AA meetings. Carol regularly attendsAl-Anon meetings. 4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM inhalants, and cannabinoids. The nurse uses the nursing process as the vehiclefor delivery of care of the client with a substance-related disorder. The nurse must first examine his or her own feelingsregarding personal substance use and the substanceuse by others. Only the nurse who can be acceptingand nonjudgmental of substance use behaviors willbe effective in working with these clients. Special care is given to clients with dual diagnosesof mental illness and substance use disorders. Addiction to substances is a problem for manymembers of the nursing profession. Most stateboards of nursing and state nurses' associationshave established avenues for peer assistance to pro-vide help to impaired members of the profession. Individuals who are reared in families with chemi-cally addicted persons learn patterns of dysfunc-tional behavior that carry over into adult life. Thesedysfunctional behavior patterns have been termedcodependence . Codependent persons sacrifice their own needs for the fulfillment of others' in order toachieve a sense of control. Many nurses also havecodependent traits. Treatment modalities for substance-related disor-ders include self-help groups, deterrent therapy, individual counseling, and group therapy. Substi-tution pharmacotherapy is frequently imple-mented with clients experiencing substanceintoxication or substance withdrawal. Treatmentmodalities are implemented on an inpatient basisor in outpatient settings, depending on the severityof the impairment. Gambling disorder is defined by the DSM- 5as persist- ent and recurrent problematic gambling behaviorleading to clinically significant impairment or distress. The preoccupation with and impulse to gamble intensifies when the individual is under stress.Many impulsive gamblers describe a physical sen-sation of restlessness and anticipation that can onlybe relieved by placing a bet. Research indicates a possible genetic component inthe etiology to gambling disorder. Abnormalities inthe serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergicneurotransmitter systems have also been implicated. A number of psychosocial influences have been implicated in the predisposition to gambling disor-der, including dysfunctional family patterns. Behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, and psycho-analysis have been used with gambling disorder, withvarious degrees of success. Various medications,such as the SSRIs, clomipramine, lithium, carba-mazine, and naltrexone, have also been tried. Gamblers Anonymous, an organization of inspira-tional group therapy modeled after AlcoholicsAnonymous, has shown to be very effective in help-ing individuals who desire to stop gambling.

(2005). Predictors of al- cohol misuse and abuse in older women. Journal ofNursing Scholarship, 37(4), 329-335. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to determine the predictive ability of self-repor t questions, physical measures, and biomarkers to detect alcohol mis- use and abuse among older women. Older women are notroutinely screened in health-care settings for alcohol use.Because they often have many other health concerns,health-care providers often fail to assess these older pa-tients for an underlying alcohol problem. T he sample in- cluded 135 healthy women aged 60 and older divided intotwo groups: drinkers (those who consumed 12 or morestandard drinks [SD] in the past year) and nondrinkers(those who consumed no alcohol during the past year). Astandard drink is identified by the National Institute on Al-cohol Abuse and Alcoholism as 1.5 oz. of distilled liquor,12 oz. of regular beer, or 5 oz. of wine. Data was gatheredfrom an alcohol-enhanced assessment interview (the T-ACE), a physical examination, and biomarker-enhancedstandard intake blood work. Biomarkers collected in thisstudy were gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), mean (MCV), (TC), high-densitylipoprotein low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and theratio of HDL to TC. Other physical data collected were sys-tolic and diastolic blood pressures, body mass index (BMI),exercise habits, past experiences of trauma, hemoglobin(Hgb), and hematocrit (Hct).RESULTS OF THE STUDY: The T-ACE questionnaire discrimi- nated strongly between the two g roups. T his test is similar to the CAGE questionnaire, with one exception. The ques-tion related to \"guilt\" is replaced with a question relatedto \"tolerance.\" (\"How many drinks does it take to makeyou feel high?\"). Analyses of the biomarkers showed sig-nificant differences in MCV, HDL, Hgb, Hct, and GGT, withdrinkers showing higher levels. Drinkers also were foundto consume more coffee and over-the-counter (OTC)drugs, and were more likely to be (or have been) smokersand to use alcohol to fall asleep. Nutrition, trauma, andblood pressure showed no significant differences betweenthe groups. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: This study suggests a way in which to identify older women who may be at risk for problems related to alcohol abuse. Results reveal prom-ising predictors of alcohol use and abuse that can be par t of clinical data collection during intake assessments in primary care and acute care. Indications suggest that thebest predictors of high-risk drinkers include the T-ACE tool(a score of 1 or higher), elevated MCV and Hgb levels,smoking or having been a smoker, drinking large amountsof coffee, using alcohol to sleep at night, and self-medicatingwith two or more OTC drugs on a routine basis. The authorssuggest that biological markers are significant predictors because alcohol is documented to have a powerful physio-logical effect on women. IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE Gaffney, K.F. (2001). Infant exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Journal of Nursing Scholarship, 33 (4), 343-347. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: A review of 10 studies with a range of 1 00 to more than 1,000 par ticipants was con- ducted. The studies took place in a variety of health-care settings in the United States, Australia, and Europe. Thestudies measured infant exposure to environmental to-bacco smoke (ETS). Parents of the infants completed theself-reports that inquired about number of people in thehousehold who smoked and the proximity of the infant tothe smoking. The studies focused on children in the firstyear of life. RESULTS OF THE STUDY: In one of the studies, question- naire information was suppor ted by hair analysis of the subjects. Median level of hair nicotine was over 1.5 times higher among infants in homes repor ted by means of questionnaires to have smokers than among those inhomes reported to have no smokers. Eight of the 10 stud-ies demonstrated increased risk for poor infant health out-comes associated with ETS exposure. Positive associationswere found between infant ETS exposure and gastroe-sophageal reflux, colic, sudden infant death syndrome,lower respiratory tract infections, ear infections, and alteredthyroid function. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The author suggests that nurses may use these results to document the need for identifying mothers who smoke as an impor tant target g roup for clinical intervention. She states, \"This review shows the importance of identifying and assisting mothers whosmoke so that this critical proximity with their infants mayprovide optimal health promotion. Nurses who care for infants as part of the regular health maintenance visits con-ducted during the first year of life are particularly well-prepared and logically situated to advise and assist thesemothers as they initiate the long-term process of smokingcessation\" (pp. 346-347).4092_Ch23_365-418 24/07/14 11:04 AM Page 415References Alcoholics Anonymous [AA].

She is engaged to a surgical resident at the local university hospital. She has been struggling todo well in law school because she wants to make her parents, twoprominent local attorneys, proud of her. She had never aspired todo anything but go into law, and that is also what her parents expected her to do. Kelly's mid-term grades were not as high as she had hoped, so she increased the number of hours of study time, staying awake allnight several nights a week to study. She started drinking largeamounts of coffee to stay awake, but still found herself falling asleepas she tried to study at the library and in her apartment. As finalexams approached, she began to panic that she would not be ableto continue the pace of studying she felt she needed in order tomake the grades she hoped for. One of Kelly's classmates told her that she needed some \"speed\" to give her that extra energy to study. Her classmate said,\"All the kids do it. Hardly anyone I know gets through law schoolwithout it.\" She gave Kelly the name of a source. Kelly contacted the source, who supplied her with enough amphetamines to see her through final exams. Kelly was excited,because she had so much energy, did not require sleep, and wasable to study the additional hours she thought she needed for theexams. However, when the results were posted, Kelly had failedtwo courses and would have to repeat them in summer school ifshe was to continue with her class in the fall. She continued to re-plenish her supply of amphetamines from her \"contact\" until hetold her he could not get her anymore. She became frantic andstole a prescription blank from her fianc\u00e9 and forged his name formore pills. She started taking more and more of the medication in order to achieve the \"high\" she wanted to feel. Her behavior became erratic. Yesterday, her fianc\u00e9 received a call from a pharmacy to clarifyan order for amphetamines that Kelly had written. He insisted thatshe admit herself to the chemical addiction unit for detoxification. On the unit, she appears tired, depressed, moves very slowly, and wants to sleep all the time. She keeps saying to the nurse, \"I'ma real failure. I'll never be an attorney like my parents. I'm too dumb.I just wish I could die.\" Answer the following questions related to Kelly: 1.What is the primary nursing diagnosis for Kelly? 2.Describe important nursing interventions to be implementedwith K elly . 3.In addition to physical safety, what would be the primary short-term goal the nurses would strive to achieve with K elly?

The word was derived from the Greek \"skhizo\" (split) and \"phren\" (mind). Over the years, much debate has surrounded the concept of schizophrenia. Various definitions of thedisorder have evolved, and numerous treatmentstrategies have been proposed, but none have provento be uniformly effective or sufficient. Although the controversy lingers, two general factors appear to be gaining acceptance among clini-cians. The first is that schizophrenia is probably not ahomogeneous disease entity with a single cause butresults from a variable combination of genetic predis-position, biochemical dysfunction, physiological fac-tors, and psychosocial stress. The second factor is thatthere is not now and probably never will be a singletreatment that cures the disorder. Instead, effectivetreatment requires a comprehensive, multidiscipli-nary effort, including pharmacotherapy and variousforms of psychosocial care, such as living skills and social skills training , rehabilitation and recovery, and family therapy. Of all the mental illnesses that cause suffering in society, schizophrenia probably is responsible forlengthier hospitalizations, greater chaos in family life,more exorbitant costs to individuals and governments,and more fears than any other. Because it is such anenormous threat to life and happiness and because itscauses are an unsolved puzzle, it has probably beenstudied more than any other mental disorder. Potential for suicide is a major concern among pa- tients with schizophrenia. About one-third of peoplewith schizophrenia attempt suicide and about 1 in 10 die from the act (Black & Andreasen, 2011). Adding-ton (2006) reports on studies that estimate the evidenceof suicidal ideation in individuals with schizophrenia to be in the range of 40 to 55 percent and attemptedsuicide to be in the range of 20 to 50 percent. Black and Andreasen (2011) stated: [Schizophrenia] is probably the most devastating illness that psychiatrists treat. [It] strikes people just when theyare preparing to enter the phase of their lives in whichthey can achieve their highest growth and productivity\u2014typically in the teens or early 20s\u2014leaving most of themunable to return to normal young adult lives: to go toschool, to find a job, or to marry and have children. According to The Global Burden of Disease, a WorldHealth Organization-sponsored study of the cost ofmedical illnesses worldwide, schizophrenia is amongthe 10 leading causes of disability in the world amongpeople in the 15-44 age range. (p. 107) This chapter explores various theories of predis- posing factors that have been implicated in the devel- opment of schizophrenia. Symptomatology associatedwith different diagnostic categories of the disorder isdiscussed. Nursing care is presented in the context ofthe six steps of the nursing process. Various dimen-sions of medical treatment are explored. Nature of the Disorder420 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT Please read the chapter and answer the following questions: 1.An alteration in which of the neurotransmit- ters is most closely associated with thesymptoms of schizophrenia? is schizoaffective disorder?3.How do atypical antipsychotic ered a first-line treatment for schizophrenia? CORE CONCEPT Psychosis A severe mental condition in which there is disorgani-zation of the personality, deterioration in social function-ing, and loss of contact with, or distortion of, reality.There may be evidence of hallucinations and delusionalthinking. Psychosis can occur with or without the presence of organic impairment. Perhaps no psychological disorder is more crippling than schizophrenia. Characteristically, disturbancesin thought processes, perception, and affect invari-ably result in a severe deterioration of social and occupational functioning. The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia is about 1 percent in the general population (Puri & Treasaden,2011). Symptoms generally appear in late adoles-cence or early adulthood, although they may occurin middle or late adult life. Symptoms that occur be-fore age 17 suggest early-onset schizophrenia (EOS), and when symptoms occur before age 13, which is veryrare, the condition is identified as very early-onset schizophrenia (VEOS) (Mattai, Hill, & Lenroot, 2010). Some studies have indicated that symptoms occurearlier in men than in women. The pattern of devel-opment of schizophrenia may be viewed in fourphases: the premorbid phase, the prodromal phase,the active psychotic Page 420Phase I: The premorbid personality often indicates social mal- adjustment, social withdrawal, irritability, and antag-onistic thoughts and behavior (Minzenberg, Yoon, &Carter, 2008). Premorbid personality and behavioralmeasurements that have been noted include beingvery shy and withdrawn, having poor peer relation-ships, doing poorly in school, and demonstrating an-tisocial behavior. Sadock and Sadock (2007) stated: In the typical, but not invariable, premorbid history of schizophrenia, patients had schizoid or schizotypalpersonalities characterized as quiet, passive, and in-troverted; as children, they had few friends. Preschiz-ophrenic adolescents may have no close friends andno dates and may avoid team sports. They may enjoy[solitary activities] to the exclusion of social activities.(p. 481) Phase II: The Prodromal Phase The prodrome of an illness refers to certain signs and symptoms that precede the characteristic manifesta-tions of the acute, fully developed illness. The prodro-mal phase of schizophrenia begins with a changefrom premorbid functioning and extends until theonset of frank psychotic symptoms. This phase can beas brief as a few weeks or months, but most studies in-dicate that the average length of the prodromal phaseis between 2 and 5 years. Lehman and associates(2006) state: During the prodromal phase the person experiences substantial functional impairment and nonspecificsymptoms such as a sleep disturbance, anxiety, irritabil-ity, depressed mood, poor concentration, fatigue, andbehavioral deficits such as deterioration in role func-tioning and social withdrawal. Positive symptoms suchas perceptual abnormalities, ideas of reference, and sus-piciousness develop late in the prodromal phase andherald the imminent onset of psychosis. (pp. 625-626) Recognition of the behaviors associated with the prodromal phase provides an opportunity for early intervention with a possibility for improvement inlong-term outcomes. Current treatment guidelinessuggest therapeutic interventions that offer supportwith identified problems, cognitive therapies to min-imize functional impairment, family interventions toimprove coping, and involvement with the schools toreduce the possibility of failure. Some controversy ex-ists as to the benefit of using pharmaceutical therapyduring the prodromal phase. Can providing interven-tions, including pharmacologic treatments, delay (oreven prevent) the onset of psychosis? Minzenberg,Yoon, and Carter (2008) stated, \"The use of [antipsy-chotic] medications to treat symptoms that are belowthe threshold of psychosis has to date been poorlystudied\" (p. 423).Phase III: Schizophrenia In the active phase of the disorder, psychotic symptomsare prominent. Following are the Diagnostic and Statis- tical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)(American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013) diag-nostic criteria for schizophrenia:* A.Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-monthperiod (or less if successfully treated). At least oneof these must be (1), (2), or (3):1.Delusions 2.Hallucinations 3.Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailmentor incoherence) 5.Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotionalexpression or avolition) B.For a significant portion of the time since theonset of the disturbance, level of functioning inone or more major areas, such as work, interper- sonal relations, or self-care, is markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset (or when theonset is in childhood or adolescence, there is fail-ure to achieve expected level of interpersonal, academic, or occupational functioning). C.Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for atleast 6 months. This 6-month period must includeat least 1 month of symptoms (or less if successfullytreated) that meet Criterion A (i.e., active-phasesymptoms) and may include periods of prodromalor residual symptoms. During these prodromal orresidual periods, the signs of the disturbance maybe manifested by only negative symptoms or by twoor more symptoms listed in Criterion A present in an attenuated form (e.g., odd beliefs, unusualperceptual experiences). D.Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolardisorder with psychotic features have been ruled outbecause either (1) no major depressive or manicepisodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms; or (2) if mood episodes have oc-curred during active-phase symptoms, they havebeen present for a minority of the total duration ofthe active and residual periods of the illness. E.The disturbance is not attributable to the physio-logical effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse,a medication) or another medical condition. F.If there is a histor y of autism spectrum disorder or a communication disorder of childhood onset,the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is madeonly if prominent delusions or hallucinations, inCHAPTER 24 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders 421 *Reprinted with permission from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (Copyright 2013). American Psychiatric Association.4092_Ch24_419-457 24/07/14 5:27 PM Page 421addition to the other required symptoms of schiz- ophrenia, are also present for at least 1 month (orless if successfully treated). Specify if: First episode, currently in acute, partial, or full remission; Multiple episodes, currently in acute,partial or full remission; Continuous; Unspecified.Specify if: With catatonia. Specify current severity. Phase IV: Residual Phase Schizophrenia is characterized by periods of remissionand exacerbation. A residual phase usually follows an ac-tive phase of the illness (symptoms described in PhaseIII). During the residual phase, symptoms of the acutestage are either absent or no longer prominent. Negativesymptoms may remain, and flat affect and impairmentin role functioning are common. Residual impairmentoften increases between episodes of active psychosis. Prognosis Outcomes in schizophrenia are difficult to predict, buta complete return to full premorbid functioning is notcommon. However, several factors have been associ-ated with a more positive outcome. These factors in-clude good premorbid functioning, later age at onset,female gender, abrupt onset of symptoms with obviousprecipitating factor (as opposed to gradual insidiousonset of symptoms), associated mood disturbance,rapid resolution of active-phase symptoms, minimalresidual symptoms, absence of structural brain abnor-malities, normal neurological functioning, and no fam-ily history of schizophrenia (Black & Andreasen, 2011;Puri & Treasaden, 2011; Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Predisposing Factors The cause of schizophrenia is still uncertain. Mostlikely no single factor can be implicated in the etiology;rather, the disease probably results from a combinationof influences including biological, psychological, andenvironmental factors. Biological Factors Refer to Chapter 4 for a more thorough review of thebiological implications of psychiatric illness. Genetics The body of evidence for genetic vulnerability to schiz-ophrenia is growing. Studies show that relatives of individuals with schizophrenia have a much higherprobability of developing the disease than does thegeneral population. Whereas the lifetime risk for de-veloping schizophrenia is about 1 percent in most pop-ulation studies, the siblings of an identified client havea 10 percent risk of developing schizophrenia, and off-spring with one parent who has schizophrenia have a5 to 6 percent chance of developing the disorder(Black & Andreasen, 2011). How schizophrenia is inherited is uncertain. No de- finitive biological marker has as yet been found. Studiesare ongoing to determine which genes are importantin the vulnerability to schizophrenia, and whether oneor many genes are implicated. Some individuals have astrong genetic link to the illness, whereas others mayhave only a weak genetic basis. This theory gives furthercredence to the notion of multiple causations. Twin Studies The rate of schizophrenia among monozygotic (iden-tical) twins is four times that of dizygotic (fraternal)twins and approximately 50 times that of the generalpopulation (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Identical twinsreared apart have the same rate of development of theillness as do those reared together. Because in abouthalf of the cases only one of a pair of monozygotictwins develops schizophrenia, some investigators be-lieve environmental factors interact with genetic ones. Adoption Studies In studies conducted by both American and Danish in-vestigators, adopted children born of schizophrenicmothers were compared with adopted children whosemothers had no psychiatric disorder. Children whowere born to mothers with schizophrenia were morelikely to develop the illness than the comparison con-trol groups (Minzenberg et al., 2008). Studies also in-dicate that children born to nonschizophrenic parents,but reared by parents afflicted with the illness, do notseem to suffer more often from schizophrenia thangeneral controls. These findings provide additional evidence for the genetic basis of schizophrenia. Biochemical Factors The oldest and most thoroughly explored biologicaltheory in the explanation of schizophrenia attributesa pathogenic role to abnormal brain biochemistry.Notions of a \"chemical disturbance\" as an explana-tion for insanity were suggested by some theorists asearly as the mid-19th century. The Dopamine Hypothesis This theory suggests that schizophrenia (or schizo-phrenia-like symptoms) may be caused by an excessof dopamine-dependent neuronal activity in the brain(Fig. 24-1). This excess activity may be related to in-creased production or release of the substance atnerve terminals, increased receptor sensitivity, toomany dopamine receptors, or a combination of thesemechanisms (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Pharmacological support for this hypothesis exists. Amphetamines, which increase levels of dopamine, in-duce psychotomimetic symptoms. The antipsychotics(e.g., chlorpromazine or haloperidol) lower brain 422 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch24_419-457 24/07/14 5:27 PM Page 422CHAPTER 24 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders 423 NEUROTRANSMITTERS A number of neurotransmitters have been implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia. These include dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The dopaminergic system has been most widely studied and closelylinked to the symptoms associated with the disease. AREAS OF THE BRAIN AFFECTED Four major dopaminergic pathways have been identified:\u0081Mesolimbic pathway: originates in the ventral tegmentum area and projects to areas of the limbic system, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and hippocampus. The mesolimbic pathway is associated with functions of memory, emotion, arousal, andpleasure. Excess activity in the mesolimbic tract has been implicated in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g., hallucin ations, delusions). \u0081Mesocortical pathway: originates in the ventral tegmentum area and has projections into the cortex. The mesocortical pathway is concerned with cognition, social behavior, planning, problem solving, motivation, and reinforcement in learning. Negative sympt oms of schizophrenia (e.g., flat affect, apathy, lack of motivation, and anhedonia) have been associated with diminished activity i n the mesocortical tract. \u0081Nigrostriatal pathway: originates in the substantia in the striatum of the basal ganglia. This pathway is associated with the function of motor control. Degeneration in this pathway is associated with Parkinson's disease and involuntary psychom otor symptoms of schizophrenia. \u0081Tuberoinfundibular pathway: originates in the hypothalamus and projects to the pituitary gland. It is associated with endocrine function, digestion, metabolism, hunger, thirst, temperature control, and sexual arousal. Implicated in certain endocrineabnormalities associated with schizophrenia. Two major groups of dopamine receptors and their highest tissue locations include:\u0081 The D 1Family: Continued4092_Ch24_419-457 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 423levels of dopamine by blocking dopamine receptors, thus reducing the schizophrenic symptoms, includingthose induced by amphetamines. Postmortem studies of brains of individuals who had schizophrenia have reported a significant increase inthe average number of dopamine receptors in approx-imately two-thirds of the brains studied. This suggeststhat an increased dopamine response may not be im-portant in allindividuals with schizophrenia. Clients with acute manifestations (e.g., delusions and halluci-nations) respond with greater efficacy to antipsychoticdrugs than do clients with chronic manifestations (e.g.,apathy, poverty of ideas, and loss of drive). The currentposition, in terms of the dopamine hypothesis, is thatmanifestations of acute schizophrenia may be relatedto increased numbers of dopamine receptors in thebrain and respond to antipsychotic drugs that blockthese receptors. Manifestations of chronic schizophre-nia are probably unrelated to numbers of dopaminereceptors, and antipsychotic drugs are unlikely to beas effective in treating these chronic symptoms. Other Biochemical Hypotheses Various other biochemicals have been implicated inthe (GABA)and in the neuroregulators, such as prostaglandinsand endorphins, have been suggested. Recent research has implicated the neurotransmit- ter glutamate in the etiology of schizophrenia. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is the receptor that is activated by the neurotransmitters glutamateand glycine. Psychopharmacological studies [PCP]; can produceschizophrenic-like symptoms in thedisorder (Hashimoto, 2006; Stahl, 2008). In one recentstudy, subjects who were experiencing ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms weretreated with a drug trial of a glycine transporter-1 in-hibitor (D'Souza et al., 2012). This medication wasshown to reduce the effects induced by the NMDA re-ceptor antagonism of the ketamine. The researcherssuggest that \"enhancing function by site of the NMDA receptor withglycine, D-serine, or with drugs that inhibit glycine reuptake may have therapeutic potential in schizophre-nia\" (p. 1036). Currently available conventional an-tipsychotic medications largely target the dopaminereceptors in the brain. Newer novel antipsychotics havestrong affinity for serotonergic receptors. The gluta-mate model of schizophrenia suggests possibilities fornew therapeutic target options, including NMDA ago-nists, glycine transport inhibitors, metabotropicglutamate receptor agonists (Citrome, 2011). Physiological Factors A number of physical factors of possible etiologicalsignificance have been identified in the medical liter-ature. However, their specific mechanisms in the implication of schizophrenia are unclear. Viral Infection Sadock and Sadock (2007) report that epidemiologi-cal data indicate a high incidence of schizophreniaafter prenatal exposure to influenza. They stated: Other data supporting a viral hypothesis are an increased number of physical anomalies at birth, anincreased rate of pregnancy and birth complications,seasonality of birth consistent with viral infection, geographical clusters of adult cases, and seasonalityof hospitalizations.

Anatomical Abnormalities With the use of neuroimaging technologies, struc-tural brain abnormalities have been observed in indi-viduals with schizophrenia. Ventricular enlargementis the most consistent finding; atrophy are Andreasen (2011) have suggested that \"ventricu-lar enlargement is associated with poor premorbidfunctioning, negative symptoms, poor response totreatment, and cognitive impairment\" (p. 122). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a greater ability to image in multiple planes. Studieswith MRI have revealed a possible decrease in cere-bral and intracranial size in clients with schizophre-nia. Studies have also revealed a decrease in frontallobe size, but this has been less consistently replicated.MRI has been used to explore possible abnormalitiesin specific subregions such as the amygdala, hip-pocampus, temporal lobes, basal ganglia in thebrains of people with schizophrenia. Histological Changes Cerebral changes in schizophrenia have also been stud-ied at the microscopic level. A \"disordering\" or disarrayof the pyramidal cells in the area of the hippocampushas been suggested (Jonsson, Luts, Guldberg-Kjaer, &Brun, 1997). This disarray of cells has been comparedto the normal alignment of the cells in the brains ofclients without the disorder. Some researchers havehypothesized that this alteration in hippocampal cellsoccurs during the second trimester of pregnancy andmay be related to an influenza virus encountered bythe mother during this period. Further research is re-quired to determine the possible link between thisbirth defect and the development of schizophrenia. Physical Conditions Some studies have reported a link between schizo-phrenia and epilepsy (particularly temporal lobe),Huntington's disease, birth trauma, head injury inadulthood, alcohol abuse, cerebral tumor (particularlyin the sys-temic Psychological Factors Early conceptualizations of schizophrenia focused onfamily relationship factors as major influences in thedevelopment of the illness, probably in light of theconspicuous absence of information related to a bio-logical connection. These early theories implicatedpoor parent-child relationships and dysfunctionalfamily systems as the cause of schizophrenia, but theyno longer hold any credibility. Researchers now focustheir studies in terms of schizophrenia as a brain dis-order. Nevertheless, Sadock and Sadock (2007) havestated: Clinicians should consider both the psychosocial and biological factors affecting schizophrenia. The disor-der affects individual patients, each of whom has a unique psychological makeup. Although many psychodynamic theories about the pathogenesis ofschizophrenia seem outdated, perceptive clinical observations can help contemporary clinicians understand how the disease may affect a patient's psyche. (p. 474) Environmental Influences Sociocultural Factors Many studies have been conducted that have attempted to link schizophrenia to social class. Indeed epidemio-logical statistics have shown that greater numbers of individuals from the lower socioeconomic classes expe-rience symptoms associated with schizophrenia than dothose from the higher socioeconomic groups (Puri &Treasaden, 2011). Explanations for this occurrence in-clude the conditions associated with living in poverty,such as congested housing accommodations, inadequatenutrition, absence of prenatal care, few resources fordealing with stressful situations, and feelings of hope- lessness for changing one's li festyle of poverty. An alternative view is that of the downward drift hypoth- esis, which suggests that, because of the characteristicsymptoms of the disorder, individuals with schizophre-nia have difficulty maintaining gainful employment and\"drift down\" to a lower socioeconomic level (or fail torise out of a lower socioeconomic group). Proponentsof this view consider poor social conditions to be a con-sequence rather than a cause of schizophrenia. Stressful Life Events Studies have been conducted in an effort to determinewhether psychotic episodes may be precipitated bystressful life events. There is no scientific evidence toindicate that stress causes schizophrenia. It is veryprobable, however, that stress may contribute to theseverity and course of the illness. It is known that ex-treme stress can precipitate psychotic episodes. Stressmay indeed precipitate symptoms in an individual whopossesses a genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia. Stressful life events also may be associated with ex- acerbation of schizophrenic symptoms and increasedrates of relapse. The Transactional Model The etiology of schizophrenia remains unclear. Nosingle theory or hypothesis has been postulated thatCHAPTER 24 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders 4254092_Ch24_419-457 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 425substantiates a clear-cut explanation for the disease. Indeed, it seems the more research that is conducted,the more evidence is compiled to support the conceptof multiple causation in the development of schizo-phrenia. The most current theory seems to be thatschizophrenia is a biologically based disease, the onsetof which is influenced by factors within the environ-ment (either internal or external). The dynamics ofschizophrenia using the Transactional Model ofStress/Adaptation are presented in Figure 24-2.426 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation Precipitating Event (Any event sufficiently stressful to threaten an already weak ego) Family history of schizophrenia Possible biochemical alterationsPossible birth defect Abnormal brain structure Physical condition, such as epilepsy , Huntington's disease, brain tumor , Parkinsonism Inadequate coping skillsPredisposing Factors Genetic Influences: Past Experiences: Existing Conditions: Cognitive appraisal * Primary * (Perceived threat to self-concept or physical integrity) * Secondary * Quality of responseBecause of weak ego strength, patient is unable to use coping mechanisms effectively.

Several of the disorders may carry the additional specification of with catatonic features, the criteria for which are presented in Box 24-1. The disorders towhich this specifier may be applied include brief psy-chotic disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizophre-nia, schizoaffective disorder, and substance-inducedpsychotic disorder. It may also be applied to neurode-velopmental disorders, major depressive disorder, andbipolar disorders I and II (APA, 2013). The DSM-5 initiates the spectrum of disorders with schizotypal personality disorder. For purposes of thistextbook, this disorder is presented in Chapter 32,\"Personality Disorders.\" Delusional Disorder Delusional disorder is characterized by the presence ofdelusions that have been experienced by the individualfor at least 1 month (APA, 2013). If present at all, hal-lucinations are not prominent, and behavior is notbizarre. The subtype of delusional disorder is based onthe predominant delusional theme. The DSM-5 states that a specifier may be added to denote if the delusionsare considered bizarre (i.e., if the thought is \"clearly im- plausible, not understandable, and not derived fromordinary life 91]). Subtypes of delu-sional disorder include the following: Erotomanic Type With this type of delusion, the individual believes thatsomeone, usually of a higher status, is in love with himor her. Famous persons are often the subjects of erotomanic delusions. Sometimes the delusion is keptsecret, but some individuals may follow, contact, orotherwise try to pursue the object of their delusion. Grandiose Type Individuals with grandiose delusions have irrationalideas regarding their own worth, talent, knowledge,or power. They may believe that they have a specialrelationship with a famous person, or even assumethe identity of a famous person (believing that the ac-tual person is an imposter). Grandiose delusions of areligious nature may lead to assumption of the iden-tity of a deity or religious leader. Jealous Type The content of jealous delusions centers on the ideathat the person's sexual partner is unfaithful. Theidea is irrational and without cause, but the individualwith the delusion searches for evidence to justify thebelief. The sexual partner is confronted (and some-times physically attacked) regarding the imagined infidelity. The imagined \"lover\" of the sexual partnermay also be the object of the attack. Attempts to re-strict the autonomy of the sexual partner in an effortto stop the imagined infidelity are common. Persecutory Type In persecutory delusions, which are the most com-mon type, individuals believe they are being perse-cuted or malevolently treated in some way. Frequentthemes include being plotted against, cheated or defrauded, followed and spied on, poisoned, ordrugged. The individual may obsess about and exag-gerate a slight rebuff (either real or imagined) untilit becomes the focus of a delusional system. Repeatedcomplaints may be directed at legal authorities, lackof satisfaction from which may result in violence toward the object of the delusion.CHAPTER 24 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders 427 BOX 24-1 Diagnostic Criteria for Catatonia Specifier The clinical picture is dominated by three (or more) of the following symptoms: 1. Stupor (i.e., no psychomotor activity; not actively related to environment) 2. Catalepsy (i.e., passive induction of a posture held against gravity) 3. Waxy flexibility (i.e., slight, even resistance to positioning by examiner) 4. Mutism (i.e., no, or very little, verbal response [exclude if known aphasia]) 5. Negativism (i.e., opposition or no response to instructions or external stimuli) 6. Posturing (i.e., spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against gravity) 7. Mannerism (i.e., odd, circumstantial caricature of normal actions) 8. Stereotypy (i.e., repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goal-directed movements) 9. Agitation, not influenced by external stimuli 10. Echolalia (i.e., mimicking another's speech)12. Echopraxia (i.e., mimicking another's movements) Reprinted with permission from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (Copyright 2013). American Psychiatric Association.4092_Ch24_419-457 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 427Somatic Type Individuals with somatic delusions believe they have some type of general medical condition. Mixed Type When the disorder is mixed, delusions are prominent,but no single theme is predominant. Brief Psychotic Disorder This disorder is identified by the sudden onset ofpsychotic symptoms that may or may not be pre-ceded by a severe psychosocial stressor. These symp-toms last at least 1 day but less than 1 month, andthere is an eventual full return to the premorbidlevel of functioning (APA, 2013). The individual ex-periences emotional turmoil or overwhelming per-plexity or confusion. Evidence of impaired realitytesting may include incoherent speech, delusions,hallucinations, bizarre behavior, and disorientation.Individuals with preexisting personality disorders(most commonly histrionic, narcissistic, paranoid,schizotypal, and borderline personality disorders)appear to be susceptible to this disorder (Sadock &Sadock, 2007). Catatonic features may also be asso-ciated with this disorder (see Box 24-1). Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder The prominent hallucinations and delusions associ- ated with this disorder are found to be directly attrib-utable to substance intoxication or withdrawal or toexposure to a medication or toxin. This diagnosis ismade when the symptoms are more excessive andmore severe than those usually associated with the in-toxication or withdrawal syndrome (APA, 2013). Themedical history, physical examination, or laboratoryfindings provide evidence that the appearance of thesymptoms occurred in association with a substance in-toxication or withdrawal or exposure to a medicationor toxin. Substances that are believed to induce psychotic disorders are presented in Table 24-1. Cata-tonic features may also be associated with this disor-der (see Box 24-1). Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition The essential features of this disorder are prominent hallucinations and delusions that can be directly attributed to another medical condition (APA, 2013).The diagnosis is not made if the symptoms occur dur-ing the course of a delirium. A number of medicalconditions that can cause psychotic symptoms are pre-sented in Table 24-2.428 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation TABLE 24-1 Substances That May Cause Psychotic Disorders Drugs of abuse Medications Toxins SOURCES: APA paint, toluene) Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition Catatonic disorder is identified by the symptoms de- scribed in Box 24-1. This diagnosis is made when thesymptomatology is evidenced from medical history,physical examination, or laboratory findings to be di-rectly attributable to the physiological consequencesof another medical condition (APA, 2013). Types ofmedical conditions that have been associated withcatatonic disorder include metabolic disorders (e.g.,hepatic encephalopathy, hyperadrenalism, B 12defi- ciency) and neurological conditions (e.g., cerebrovascular disease, andencephalitis) (Levenson, 2009).4092_Ch24_419-457 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 428Schizophreniform Disorder The essential features of schizophreniform disorder are identical to those of schizophrenia, with the exception that the duration, including prodromal, ac-tive, and residual phases, is at least 1 month but lessthan 6 months (APA, 2013). If the diagnosis is madewhile the individual is still symptomatic but has beenso for less than 6 months, it is qualified as \"provi-sional.\" The diagnosis is changed to schizophrenia ifthe clinical picture persists beyond 6 months. Schizo-phreniform disorder is thought to have a good prog-nosis if the individual's affect is not blunted or flat, ifthere is a rapid onset of psychotic symptoms from thetime the unusual behavior is noticed, or if the pre-morbid social and occupational functioning was satisfactory (APA, 2013). Catatonic features may alsobe associated with this disorder (see Box 24-1). Schizoaffective Disorder This disorder is manifested by schizophrenic behav-iors, with a strong element of symptomatology associ-ated with the mood disorders (depression or mania).The client may appear depressed, with psychomotorretardation and suicidal ideation, or symptoms may include euphoria, grandiosity, and hyperactivity. Thedecisive factor in the diagnosis of schizoaffective disor-der is the presence of hallucinations and/or delusionsthat occur for at least 2 weeks in the absence of a majormood episode (APA, 2013). However, prominent mooddisorder symptoms must be evident for a majority of the time. The prognosis for schizoaffective disorder isgenerally better than that for other schizophrenic dis-orders but worse than that for mood disorders alone(Andreasen & Black, 2011). Catatonic features may alsobe associated with this disorder (see Box 24-1). Application of the Nursing Process Schizophrenia\u2014Background Assessment Data The diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were pre- sented earlier in this chapter. As previously stated,symptoms may present in phases, with schizophreniarepresenting the active phase of the disorder. Symp-toms associated with the active phase are discussed inthis section. In the first step of the nursing process, the nurse gathers a database from which nursing diagnoses arederived and a plan of care is formulated. This firststep of the nursing process is extremely important because without an accurate assessment, problemidentification, objectives of care, and outcome criteriacannot be accurately determined. Assessment of the client with schizophrenia may be a complex process, based on information gatheredfrom a number of sources. Clients in an acute episodeof their illness are seldom able to make a significantcontribution to their history. Data may be obtainedfrom family members, if possible; from old records, ifavailable; or from other individuals who have been ina position to report on the progression of the client'sbehavior. The nurse must be familiar with behaviors com- mon to the disorder to be able to obtain an adequateassessment of the client with schizophrenia. Symp-toms of schizophrenia are commonly described aspositive or negative. Positive symptoms tend to reflectan alteration or distortion of normal mental func-tions, whereas negative symptoms reflect a diminu-tion or loss of normal functions. Most clients exhibita mixture of both types of symptoms. Positive symptoms are associated with normal brain structures on computed tomography (CT) scan and rel-atively good responses to treatment. Regarding negativesymptoms, Ho, Black, and Andreasen (2003) havestated, \"Not only are [they] difficult to treat and respondless well to antipsychotics than positive symptoms, butCHAPTER 24 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders 429 TABLE 24-2 General Medical Conditions That May Cause Psychotic Symptoms Acute intermittent porphyria 429they are also the most destructive because they render the patient inert and unmotivated\" (p. 386). The behavioral disturbances associated with schiz- ophrenia are described in the following sections.They are categorized as positive or negative and con-sidered in eight areas of functioning: content ofthought, form of thought, perception, affect, sense ofself, volition, interpersonal functioning and relation-ship to the external world, and psychomotor behav-ior. Additional impairments outside the limits of theseeight areas are also presented. A summary of positiveand negative symptoms is presented in Box 24-2. Positive Symptoms Content of Thought Delusions Delusions are false personal beliefs that are inconsistent with the person's intelligence or cultural background. The individual continues to have the be-lief in spite of obvious proof that it is false or irrational.Delusions are subdivided according to their content.Some of the more common ones are listed here. Delusion of Persecution. The individual feels threatened and believes that others intend harmor persecution toward him or her in some way(e.g., \"The FBI has 'bugged' my room and intendsto kill me.\" \"I can't take a shower in this bathroom;the nurses have put a camera in there so that theycan watch everything I do\"). Delusion of Grandeur. The individual has an exag- gerated feeling of importance, power, knowledge,or identity (e.g., \"I am Jesus Christ\"). Delusion of Reference. All events within the envi- ronment are referred by the psychotic person tohim- or herself (e.g., \"Someone is trying to get amessage to me through the articles in this maga-zine [or newspaper or TV program]; I must breakthe code so that I can receive the message\"). Ideas of reference are less rigid than delusions of refer-ence. An example of an idea of reference is irra-tionally assuming that, when in the presence ofothers, one is the object of their discussion orridicule. Delusion of Control or Influence. The individual be- lieves certain objects or persons have control overhis or her behavior (e.g., \"The dentist put a fillingin my tooth; I now receive transmissions through thefilling that control what I think and do\"). Somatic Delusion. The individual has a false idea about the functioning of his or her body (e.g., \"I'm70 years old and I will be the oldest person ever togive birth. The doctor says I'm not pregnant, but Iknow I am.\").430 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation BOX 24-2 Positive and Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia POSITIVE SYMPTOMS Content of ThoughtDelusionsReligiosity P aranoia Magical thinking Form of Thought Associative or affectApathy Volition Inability to initiate goal-directed activity Emotional ambivalenceDeteriorated appearance Interpersonal Functioning and Relationship to the External W orld Impaired social interactionSocial isolation Psychomotor Behavior AnergiaWaxy flexibilityPosturingPacing Associated Features AnhedoniaRegression4092_Ch24_419-457 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 430Nihilistic Delusion. The individual has a false idea that the self, a part of the self, others, or the world is nonexistent (e.g., \"The world no longer exists.\"\"I have no heart.\"). Religiosity Religiosity is an excessive demonstration of or obsession with religious ideas and behavior. Because individuals vary greatly in their religious beliefs and level of spiritual commitment, religiosityis often difficult to assess. The individual with schizo-phrenia may use religious ideas in an attempt to pro-vide rational meaning and structure to his or herbehavior. Religious preoccupation in this vein maytherefore be considered a manifestation of the illness.However, clients who derive comfort from their reli-gious beliefs should not be discouraged from employ-ing this means of support. An example of religiosityis the individual who believes the voice he or shehears is God and incessantly searches the Bible for interpretation. Paranoia Individuals with paranoia have extreme sus- piciousness of others and of their actions or perceived intentions (e.g., \"I won't eat this food. I know it has been poisoned.\"). Magical Thinking With magical thinking, the person believes that his or her thoughts or behaviors have control over specific situations or people (e.g., themother who believed if she scolded her son in any wayhe would be taken away from her). Magical thinkingis common in children (e.g., \"It's raining; the sky is sad.\" \"It snowed last night because I wished ver y, very hard that it would.\"). Form of Thought Associative Looseness Thinking is characterized by speech in which ideas shift from one unrelated sub-ject to another. With associative looseness , the indi- vidual is unaware that the topics are unconnected.When the condition is severe, speech may be incoher-ent (e.g., \"We wanted to take the bus, but the airporttook all the traffic. Driving is the ticket when you wantto get somewhere. No one needs a ticket to heaven.We have it all in our pockets.\"). Neologisms The psychotic person invents new words, or neologisms, that are meaningless to others but have symbolic meaning to the psychotic person (e.g., \"Shewanted to give me a ride in her new uniphorum. \"). Concrete Thinking Concreteness, or literal interpreta-tions of the environment, represents a regression toan earlier level of cognitive development. Abstractthinking is very difficult. For example, the client with schizophrenia would have great difficulty describingthe abstract meaning of sayings such as \"I'm climbingthe walls\" or \"It's raining cats and dogs.\"Clang Associations Choice of words is governed by sounds. Clang associations often take the form of r hyming. For instance, \"It is very cold. I am cold and bold. The gold has been sold.\" Word Salad A word salad is a group of words that are put together randomly , without any logical connec- tion (e.g., \"Most forward action grows life double plays circle uniform.\"). Circumstantiality With circumstantiality, the individual delays in reaching the point of a communication be- cause of unnecessar y and tedious details. The point or goal is usually met but only with numerous inter-ruptions by the interviewer to keep the person ontrack of the topic being discussed. Tangentiality Tangentiality differs from circumstantial- ity in that the person never really gets to the point of the communication. Unrelated topics are introduced,and the focus of the original discussion is lost. Mutism Mutism is an individual's inability or refusal to speak. Perseveration The individual who exhibits persevera- tion persistently repeats the same word or idea in response to different questions. Perception Hallucinations Hallucinations, or false sensory percep- tions not associated with real external stimuli, may involve any of the five senses. T ypes of hallucinations include the following: Auditory. Auditory hallucinations are false percep- tions of sound. Most commonly they are of voices, but the individual may report clicks, rushingnoises, music, and other noises. Command hallu-cinations may place the individual or others in apotentially dangerous situation. \"Voices\" that issuecommands for violence to self or others may ormay not be heeded by the psychotic person. Audi-tory hallucinations are the most common type inpsychiatric disorders. Visual. These are false visual perceptions. They may consist of formed images, such as of people,or of unformed images, such as flashes of light. Tactile. Tactile hallucinations are false perceptions of the sense of touch, often of something on orunder the skin. One specific tactile hallucinationis formication, the sensation that something iscrawling on or under the skin. Gustatory. This type is a false perception of taste. Most commonly, gustatory hallucinations are described asunpleasant tastes. Olfactory. Olfactory hallucinations are false per- ceptions of the sense of smell.CHAPTER 24 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders 4314092_Ch24_419-457 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 431Illusions Illusions are misperceptions or misinterpre- tations of real external stimuli. Sense of Self Sense of self describes the uniqueness and individu- ality a person feels. Because of extremely weak egoboundaries, the individual with schizophrenia lacksthis feeling of uniqueness and experiences a greatdeal of confusion regarding his or her identity. Echolalia The client with schizophrenia may repeat words that he or she hears, which is called echolalia. This is an attempt to identify with the person speak-ing. (For instance, the nurse says, \"John, it's time for lunch.\" The client may respond, \"It' s time for lunch, it's time for lunch\" or sometimes, \"Lunch, lunch,lunch, lunch\"). Echopraxia The client who exhibits echopraxia may purposelessly imitate movements made by others.Identification and Imitation Identification, which oc- curs on an unconscious level, and imitation, which occurs on a conscious level, are ego defense mecha-nisms used by individuals with schizophrenia and re-flect their confusion regarding self-identity . Because they have difficulty knowing where their ego bound-aries end and another person's begins, their behavioroften takes on the form of that which they see in theother person. Depersonalization The unstable self-identity of an in- dividual with schizophrenia may lead to feelings of unreality (e.g., feeling that one's extremities have changed in size; or a sense of seeing oneself from adistance). Negative Symptoms Affect Affect describes the behavior associated with an indi-vidual's feeling state or emotional tone. Inappropriate Affect Affect is inappropriate when the individual's emotional tone is incongruent with the circumstances (e.g., a young woman who laughs when told of the death of her mother). Bland or Flat Af fect Affect is described as bland when the emotional tone is very weak. The individual with flat affect appears to be void of emotional tone (or overt expression of feelings). Apathy The client with schizophrenia often demon- strates an indifference to or disinterest in the environ-ment. The bland or flat affect is a manifestation of theemotional apathy. Volition Impaired volition has to do with the inability to initi-ate goal-directed activity. In the individual with schizophrenia, this may take the form of inadequateinterest, motivation, or ability to choose a logicalcourse of action in a given situation. Emotional Ambivalence Ambivalence in the client with schizophrenia refers to the coexistence of opposite emotions toward the same object, person, or situa-tion. These opposing emotions may interfere with the person' s ability to make even a very simple decision (e.g., whether to have coffee or tea with lunch). Un-derlying the ambivalence is the difficulty the clientwith schizophrenia has in fulfilling a satisfying humanrelationship. This difficulty is based on the need-fear dilemma\u2014the simultaneous need for and fear ofintimacy. Deteriorated Appearance Personal grooming and self- care activities may be neglected. The client with schiz-ophrenia may appear disheveled and untidy and mayneed to be reminded of the need for personal hygiene. Interpersonal Functioning and Relationship to the External World Impairment in social functioning may be reflected in social isolation, emotional detachment, and lack ofregard for social convention. Impaired Social Interaction Some clients with acute schizophrenia cling to others and intrude on the per- sonal space of others, exhibiting behaviors that arenot socially and culturally acceptable. Social Isolation Individuals with schizophrenia some- times focus inward on themselves to the exclusion of the external environment. Psychomotor Behavior Anergia Anergia is a deficiency of energy. The indi-vidual with schizophrenia may lack sufficient energyto carry out activities of daily living or to interact with others. W axy Flexibility Waxy flexibility describes a condition in which the client with schizophrenia allows body parts to be placed in bizarre or uncomfortable posi-tions. Once placed in position, the arm, leg, or headremains in that position for long periods, regardlessof how uncomfortable it is for the client. For example,the nurse may position the client's arm in an outward position to take a blood pressure measurement.When the cuff is removed, the client may maintainthe arm in the position in which it was placed to takethe reading. Posturing This symptom is manifested by the volun- tary assumption of inappropriate or bizarre postures. Pacing and Rocking Pacing back and forth and body rocking (a slow, r hythmic, backward-and-forward swaying of the trunk from the hips, usually while 432 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch24_419-457 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 432sitting) are common psychomotor behaviors of the client with schizophrenia. Associated Features Anhedonia Anhedonia is the inability to experience pleasure. This is a particularly distressing symptomthat compels some clients to attempt suicide. Regression Regression is the retreat to an earlier level of development. Regression, a primary defense mech- anism of schizophrenia, is a dysfunctional attempt to reduce anxiety . It provides the basis for many of the behaviors associated with schizophrenia. Diagnosis/Outcome Identification Using information collected during the assessment,the nurse completes the client database, from whichthe selection of appropriate nursing diagnoses is de-termined. Table 24-3 presents a list of client behaviorsand the NANDA International (NANDA-I) nursing diagnoses that correspond to those behaviors, whichmay be used in planning care for clients with psychoticdisorders. Outcome Criteria The following criteria may be used for measurement ofoutcomes in the care of the client with schizophrenia. The client: Demonstrates an ability to relate satisfactorily withothers Recognizes distortions of reality Has not harmed self or others Perceives self realistically Demonstrates the ability to perceive the environ-ment correctly Maintains anxiety at a manageable level Relinquishes the need for delusions and halluci-nationsCHAPTER 24 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders 433 TABLE 24-3 Assigning Nursing Diagnoses to Behaviors Commonly Associated With Psychotic Disorders BEHAVIORS NURSING DIAGNOSES Impaired communication (inappropriate responses), disordered thought sequencing, rapid mood swings, poor concentration, disorientation, stops talking in midsentence, tilts head to side as if to be listening Delusional thinking; inability to concentrate; impaired volition; inability to problem solve, abstract, or conceptualize; extreme suspiciousness of others; inaccurate interpretation of the environment Withdrawal, sad dull affect, need-fear dilemma, preoccupation with own thoughts, expression of feelings of rejection or of aloneness imposed by others, uncommunicative, seeks to be alone Risk factors: Agg ressive body language (e.g., clenching fists and jaw, pacing, threatening stance), verbal aggression, catatonic excitement, command hallucinations, rage reactions, history of violence, overt and aggressive acts, goal-directed destruction of objects in the environment, self-destructive behavior, or active aggressive suicidal acts Loose association of ideas, neologisms, word salad, clang associations, echolalia, verbalizations that reflect concrete thinking, poor eye contact, difficulty expressing thoughts verbally, inappropriate verbalization Difficulty carrying out tasks associated with hygiene, dressing, grooming, eating, and toileting Neglectful care of client in regard to basic human needs or illness treatment, extreme denial or prolonged overconcern regarding client's illness, depression, hostility and aggression Inability to take responsibility for meeting basic health practices, history of lack of health-seeking behavior, lack of expressed interest in improving health behaviors, demonstrated lack of knowledge regarding basic health practices Unsafe, unclean, disorderly home environment; household members express difficulty in maintaining their home in a safe and comfortable condition *These diagnoses have been retired from the NANDA-I taxonomy.

Some institutions are using a case management model to coordinate care (see Chapter 9 for more de-tailed explanation). In case management models, theplan of care may take the form of a critical pathway.Disturbed Sensory Perception: Auditory/Visual Disturbed sensory perception has been retired from the NANDA-I taxonomy, but it is retained in this text because of its appropriateness in describing specificbehaviors. In this instance, it is evidenced by behav-iors that indicate the presence of auditory hallucina-tions. The diagnosis is defined as a \"change in theamount or patterning of incoming stimuli accompa-nied by a diminished, exaggerated, distorted, or impaired response to such stimuli\" (NANDA-I, 2012,p. 490). Table 24-4 presents this nursing diagnosis incare plan format.434 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation Table 24-4 | CARE PLAN FOR THE CLIENT WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA NURSING DIAGNOSIS: DISTURBED SENSORY PERCEPTION: AUDITORY/VISUAL RELATED TO: Pa nic anxiety, extreme loneliness, and withdrawal into the self EVIDENCED BY: Inappropriate responses, disordered thought sequencing, rapid mood swings, poor concentration, disorientation OUTCOME CRITERIA NURSING INTERVENTIONS RATIONALE Short-Term Goal \u0081 Client will discuss content of hallucinations with nurse or therapist within 1 week. Long-Term Goal \u0081 Client will be able to define and test reality, reducing or eliminatingthe occurrence of hallucinations. This goal may not be realistic for the individual with severe and persistent illness who has experienced auditory hallucinations for many years. A more realistic goal may be: \u0081 Client will verbalize understanding that the voices are a result of his or her illness and demonstrate ways to interrupt the hallucination.1.Observe client for signs of halluci-nations (listening pose, laughing ortalking to self , stopping in midsen- tence). Ask, \" Are you hearing the voices again?\" 2.Avoid touching the client withoutwarning him or her that you areabout to do so. 3.An attitude of acceptance will encourage the client to share thecontent of the hallucination withyou. Ask, \"W hat do you hear the voices saying to you?\" 4. Do not reinforce the hallu - cination. Use \"the voices\" instead of words like \"they\" thatimply validation. Let client knowthat you do not share the percep-tion. Say , \"Even though I realize the voices are real to you, I do nothear any voices speaking.\" 5.Help the client understand theconnection between increasedanxiety and the presence of hallucinations. 6.Try to distract the client from thehallucination. 1.Early intervention may prevent aggressive response to command hallucinations. 2.Client may perceive touch asthreatening and may respond in anaggressive manner . 3.This is important to prevent possi-ble injury to the client or othersfrom command hallucinations. 4.It is important for the nurse to behonest, and the client must acceptthe perception as unreal beforehallucinations can be eliminated. 5.If client can learn to interrupt esca-lating anxiety , hallucinations may be prevented. 6.Involvement in interpersonal activi-ties and explanation of the actualsituation will help bring the clientback to reality .4092_Ch24_419-457 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 434Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals. Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal Client will discuss content of hallucinations withnurse or therapist within 1 week. Long-Term Goal Client will be able to define and test reality, reduc-ing or eliminating the occurrence of hallucinations. This goal may not be realistic for the individual with severe and persistent illness who has experiencedauditory hallucinations for many years. A more real-istic goal may be: Client will verbalize understanding that the voicesare a result of his or her illness and demonstrateways to interrupt the hallucination. Interventions Observe the client for signs of hallucinations (lis-tening pose, laughing or talking to self, stoppingin midsentence). Ask, \"Are you hearing the voicesagain?\" Early intervention may prevent aggressiveresponses to command hallucinations. Avoid touching the client before warning him orher that you are about to do so. The client may perceive touch as threatening and respond in anaggressive or defensive manner. An attitude of acceptance will encourage the clientto share the content of the hallucination with you.Ask, \"What do you hear the voices saying to you?\" Thisis important in order to prevent possible injury to theclient or others from command hallucinations.CHAPTER 24 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders 435 Table 24-4 | CARE PLAN FOR THE CLIENT WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA\u2014cont'd OUTCOME CRITERIA NURSING INTERVENTIONS RATIONALE 7.For some clients, auditory halluci- nations persist after the acute psychotic episode has subsided.Listening to the radio or watchingtelevision helps distract someclients from attention to the voices.Others have benefited from an intervention called voice dismissal.With this technique, the client is taught to say loudly , \"Go away!\" or \"Leave me alone!\" in a consciouseffort dismiss the auditory perception.7.These activities assist the client toexert some conscious control over the hallucination. CLINICAL PEARL Do not reinforce the hallucination. Use \"the voices\" instead of words like \"they\" that imply validation. Let the client know thatyou do not share the perception. Say, \"Even though I realize thatthe voices are real to you, I do not hear any voices speaking.\" It is important for the nurse to be honest, and the client mustaccept the perception as unreal before hallucinations can be eliminated. Help the client to understand the connection between increased anxiety and the presence of hal-lucinations. If the client can learn to interrupt es-calating anxiety, hallucinations may be prevented. Try to distract the client from the hallucination. Involvement in interpersonal activities and expla-nation of the actual situation will help bring theclient back to reality. For some clients, auditory hallucinations persistafter the acute psychotic episode has subsided. Lis-tening to the radio or watching television helps distract some clients from attention to the voices.Others have benefited from an intervention calledvoice dismissal . With this technique, the client is taught to say loudly, \"Go away!\" or \"Leave me alone!\"thereby exerting some conscious control over thebehavior. Disturbed Thought Processes Disturbed thought processes has been retired from the NANDA-I taxonomy, but it is retained in this text because of its appropriateness in describing specificbehaviors. In this instance, it is evidenced by behav-iors that indicate the presence of delusional thinking, 4092_Ch24_419-457 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 435suspiciousness, and inaccurate interpretation of the environment. The diagnosis is defined as a disruptionin cognitive operations and activities. Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal By the end of 2 weeks, client will recognize and ver-balize that false ideas occur at times of increasedanxiety. Long-Term Goal Depending on chronicity of the disease process,choose the most realistic long-term goal for the client: By time of discharge from treatment, client's ver-balizations will reflect reality-based thinking withno evidence of delusional ideation. By time of discharge from treatment, the client willbe able to differentiate between delusional think-ing and reality. Interventions Convey acceptance of the client's need for the falsebelief, but indicate that you do not share the belief.The client must understand that you do not viewthe idea as real. Do not argue or deny the belief. Arguing with theclient or denying the belief serves no useful pur-pose, because delusional ideas are not eliminatedby this approach, and the development of a trust-ing relationship may be impeded. CLINICAL PEARL Use reasonable doubt as a therapeutic technique: \"I understand that you believe this is true, but I personally find it hard to accept.\" Reinforce and focus on reality. Discourage long ruminations about the irrational thinking. Talkabout real events and real people. Discussions thatfocus on the false ideas are purposeless and useless,and may even aggravate the psychosis. If the client is highly suspicious, the following interventions may be helpful: To promote the development of trust, use thesame staff as much as possible; be honest andkeep all promises. Avoid physical contact. Warn client before touch-ing to perform a procedure, such as taking ablood pressure. Suspicious clients often perceivetouch as threatening and may respond in an aggressive or defensive manner. Avoid laughing, whispering, or talking quietlywhere the client can see but cannot hear what isbeing said. Suspicious clients may believe they are being poi- soned and refuse to eat food from an individuallyprepared tray. It may be necessary to providecanned food with a can opener or serve foodfamily style. They may believe they are being poisoned withtheir medication and attempt to discard thetablets or capsules. Mouth checks may be neces-sary following medication administration to ver-ify whether client is actually swallowing the pills. Competitive activities are very threatening to suspicious clients. Activities that encourage aone-to-one relationship with the nurse or thera-pist are best. Maintain an assertive, matter-of-fact, yet genuineapproach with suspicious clients. They do nothave the capacity to relate to, and thereforeoften feel threatened by, a friendly or overlycheerful attitude. Risk for Violence: Self-Directed or Other-Directed Risk for self- or other-directed violence is defined as \"at risk for behaviors in which an individual demonstratesthat he or she can be physically, emotionally, and/orsexually harmful either to self or to others\" (NANDA-I,2012, pp. 447-448). NOTE: Please refer to Chapter 16 for additional concepts related to anger and aggressionmanagement. Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goals Within [a specified time], client will be able to rec-ognize signs of increasing anxiety and agitationand report to staff (or other care provider) for assistance with intervention. Client will not harm self or others. Long-Term Goal Client will not harm self or others. Interventions Maintain low level of stimuli in client's environ-ment (low lighting, few people, simple decor, lownoise level). Anxiety level rises in a stimulating environment. A suspicious, agitated client may perceive individuals as threatening. Observe client's behavior frequently. Do this whilecarrying out routine activities so as to avoid creat-ing suspiciousness in the individual. Close observa-tion is necessary so that intervention can occur ifrequired to ensure client (and others') safety. Remove all dangerous objects from client's environ-ment so that in his or her agitated, confused stateclient may not use them to harm self or others.436 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch24_419-457 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 436CLINICAL PEARL Intervene at the first sign of increased anxiety, agitation, or verbal or behavioral aggression. Offer empathetic response toclient's feelings: \"You seem anxious (or frustrated, or angry)about this situation. How can I help?\" Validation of the client'sfeelings conveys a caring attitude and offering assistance reinforces trust. It is important to maintain a calm attitude toward the client. As the client's anxiety increases, offersome alternatives: to participate in a physical activ-ity (e.g., punching bag, physical exercise), talkingabout the situation, taking some antianxiety med-ication. Offering alternatives to the client gives himor her a feeling of some control over the situation. Have sufficient staff available to indicate a show ofstrength to client if it becomes necessary. Thisshows the client evidence of control over the situa-tion and provides some physical security for staff. If client is not calmed by \"talking down\" or by med-ication, use of mechanical restraints may be neces-sary. The avenue of the \"least restrictive alternative\"must be selected when planning interventions fora violent client. Restraints should be used only as alast resort, after all other interventions have beenunsuccessful, and the client is clearly at risk ofharm to self or others. If restraint is deemed necessary, ensure that sufficientstaff is available to assist. Follow protocol establishedby the institution. The Joint Commission (formerlythe Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health-care Organizations [JCAHO]) requires that an in-person evaluation by a physician or other licensedindependent practitioner (LIP) be conducted within1 hour of the initiation of the restraint or seclusion(The Joint Commission, 2010). The physician or LIPmust reissue a new order for restraints every 4 hoursfor adults and every 1 to 2 hours for children andadolescents. The Joint Commission requires that the client in restraints be observed at least every 15 minutes toensure that circulation to extremities is not compro-mised (check temperature, color, pulses); to assistthe client with needs related to nutrition, hydration,and elimination; and to position the client so thatcomfort is facilitated and aspiration is prevented.Some institutions may require continuous one-to-one monitoring of restrained clients, particularlythose who are highly agitated, and for whom thereis a high risk of self- or accidental injury. As agitation decreases, assess the client's readinessfor restraint removal or reduction. Remove one restraint at a time while assessing the client's re-sponse. This minimizes the risk of injury to clientand staff. Impaired Verbal Communication Impaired verbal communication is defined as \"decreased, delayed, or absent ability to receive, process, transmit, and/or use a system of symbols\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 275). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal Client will demonstrate ability to remain on onetopic, using appropriate, intermittent eye contact,for 5 minutes with the nurse or therapist. Long-Term Goal By time of discharge from treatment, the client willdemonstrate ability to carry on a verbal communica-tion in a socially acceptable manner with health-careproviders and peers. Interventions Facilitate trust and understanding by maintainingstaff assignments as consistently as possible. In anonthreatening manner, explain to client how hisor her behavior and verbalizations are viewed byand may alienate others. CLINICAL PEARL Attempt to decode incomprehensible communication patterns. Seek validation and clarification by stating, \"Is it that you mean . . . ?\" or \"I don't understand what you mean by that. Would youplease explain it to me?\" These techniques reveal to the clienthow he or she is being perceived by others, and the responsibil- ity for not understanding is accepted by the nurse. Anticipate and fulfill the client's needs until func- tional communication has been established. Orient the client to reality as required. Call the clientby name. Validate those aspects of communicationthat help differentiate between what is real and notreal. These techniques may facilitate restoration offunctional communication patterns in the client. CLINICAL PEARL If the client is unable or unwilling to speak (mutism), using the technique of verbalizing the implied is therapeutic. (Example: \"That must have been very difficult for you when your motherleft. You must have felt very alone.\") This approach conveys em-pathy, facilitates trust, and eventually may encourage the client to discuss painful issues. Because concrete thinking prevails, abstract phrases and clich\u00e9s must be avoided, as they are likely to bemisinterpreted. Explanations must be provided atthe client's level of comprehension.

He is socially isolated and stays in his room unless strongly encouraged by the nurse to come out. He says to the nurse, \"Y ouhave to be your own boss. Y ou can't trust anybody.\" He refuses to eat any food from his tray, stating that the voiceof his deceased grandfather is telling him it is poisoned.

Evaluation of the nursing actionsfor the client with exacerbation of schizophrenic psychosis may be facilitated by gathering informationutilizing the following types of questions: Has the client established trust with at least onestaff member? Is the anxiety level maintained at a manageablelevel? Is delusional thinking still prevalent? Is hallucinogenic activity evident? Does the clientshare content of hallucinations, particularly if com-mands are heard? Is the client able to interrupt escalating anxietywith adaptive coping mechanisms? Is the client easily agitated? Is the client able to interact with others appropriately? Does the client voluntarily attend therapy activities? Is verbal communication comprehensible? Is the client compliant with medication? Does theclient verbalize the importance of taking medica-tion regularly and on a long-term basis? Does he orshe verbalize understanding of possible side effects,and when to seek assistance from the physician? Does the client spend time with others rather thanisolating self?Is the client able to carry out all activities of dailyliving independently? Is the client able to verbalize resources from whichhe or she may seek assistance outside the hospital? Does the family have information regarding sup-port groups in which they may participate, andfrom which they may seek assistance in dealing withtheir family member who is ill? If the client lives alone, does he or she have asource for assistance with home maintenance andhealth management? Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) The Institute of Medicine (IOM), in its 2003 report, Health Professions Education: A Bridge to Quality , chal- lenged faculties of medicine, nursing, and otherhealth professions to ensure that their graduates haveachieved a core set of competencies in order to meetthe needs of the 21st-century health-care system.These competencies include providing patient-centered care, working in interdisciplinary teams, employing evidence-based practice, applying quality improvement, ensuringsafety, andutilizing informatics. A QSEN teaching strat- egy is included in Box 24-4. The use of this type of ac-tivity is intended to arm the instructor and thestudent with guidelines for attaining the knowledge,skills, and attitudes necessary for achievement of qual-ity and safety competencies in nursing. Treatment Modalities for Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders Psychological Treatments Individual Psychotherapy Ho and associates (2003) stated: Although intensive psychodynamic- and insight- oriented psychotherapy is generally not recommended,the form of individual psychotherapy that psychiatristsemploy when providing pharmacological treatmenttypically involves a synthesis of various psychotherapeu-tic strategies and interventions. These include problemsolving, reality testing, psychoeducation, and support-ive and cognitive-behavioral techniques anchoredon an empathetic therapeutic alliance with the pa-tient. The goals of such individual psychotherapyare to improve medication compliance, enhance social and occupational functioning, and prevent relapse. (p. 419) Reality-oriented individual therapy is the most suit- able approach to individual psychotherapy for schiz- ophrenia. The primary focus in all cases must reflectefforts to decrease anxiety and increase trust. Establishing a relationship is often particularly difficult because the individual with schizophrenia isCHAPTER 24 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders 439 BOX 24-3 Topics for Client/Family Education Related to Schizophrenia NATURE OF THE ILLNESS 1.

He or she is likely to respond to attempts atcloseness with suspiciousness, anxiety, aggression, orregression. Successful intervention may be achievedwith honesty, simple directness, and a manner that respects the client's privacy and human dignity. Exag-gerated warmth and professions of friendship arelikely to be met with confusion and suspicion. Once a therapeutic interpersonal relationship has been established, reality orientation is maintainedthrough exploration of the client's behavior withinrelationships. Education is provided to help the clientidentify sources of real or perceived danger and waysof reacting appropriately. Methods for improving in-terpersonal communication, emotional expression,and frustration tolerance are attempted. Individual psychotherapy for clients with schizo- phrenia is seen as a long-term endeavor that requirespatience on the part of the health-care provider, aswell as the ability to accept that a great deal of changemay not occur. Some cases report treatment durationsof many years before clients regain some degree of independent functioning.Group Therapy Group therapy for individuals with schizophrenia hasbeen shown to be effective, particularly with outpa-tients and when combined with drug treatment. Sadock and Sadock (2007) stated: Group therapy for persons with schizophrenia gen- erally focuses on real-life plans, problems, and rela-tionships. Some investigators doubt that dynamicinterpretation and insight therapy are valuable fortypical patients with schizophrenia. But group ther-apy is effective in reducing social isolation, increasingthe sense of cohesiveness, and improving reality testing for patients with schizophrenia. (p. 492) Group therapy in inpatient settings is less produc- tive. Inpatient treatment usually occurs when sympto- matology and social disorganization are at their mostintense. At this time, the least amount of stimuli pos-sible is most beneficial for the client. Because grouptherapy can be intensive and highly stimulating, itmay be counterproductive early in treatment. Group therapy for schizophrenia has been most useful over the long-term course of the illness. The440 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation BOX 24-4 QSEN TEACHING STRATEGY Assignment: Using Evidence to Address Clinical Problems Intervention With a Combative Client Competency Domain: Evidence-Based Practice Learning Objectives: Student will: \u0081Differentiate clinical opinion from research and evidence summaries. \u0081Explain the role of evidence in determining the best clinical practice for intervening with combative clients. \u0081Identify gaps between what is observed in the treatment setting to what has been identified as best practice. \u0081Discriminate between valid and invalid reasons for modifying evidence-based clinical practice based on clinical exper tise or other reasons. \u0081P articipate effectively in appropriate data collection and other research activities. \u0081Acknowledge own limitations in knowledge and clinical expertise before determining when to deviate from evidence-based best practices. Strategy Overview: 1.Investigate the research related to intervening with a combative client. 2.Identify best practices described in the literature. How were these best practices determined? 3.Compare and contrast staff intervention with best practices described in the literature. 4.Investigate staff perceptions related to intervening with a combative client. How have they developed these perceptions? 5.Do staff members view any problems associated with their practice versus best practice described in the literature?If so, how would they like to see the problem addressed? 6.Describe ethical issues associated with intervening with a combative client. 7.What is your personal perception regarding the best evidence available to date related to intervening with a com-bative client? Are there situations that you can think of when you might deviate from the best practice model? 8.What questions do you have about intervening with a combative client that are not being addressed by currentresearchers? Adapted from teaching strategy submitted by Pamela M. Ironside, Associate Professor, Indiana University School of Nursing, Indi \u00a9 of cohesiveness, identifica- tion, and reality testing achieved within the group set-ting have proven to be highly therapeutic processesfor these clients. Groups that offer a supportive envi-ronment appear to be more helpful to clients withschizophrenia than those that follow a more con-frontational approach. Behavior Therapy Behavior modification has a history of qualified suc-cess in reducing the frequency of bizarre, disturbing,and deviant behaviors and increasing appropriate behaviors. Features that have led to the most positiveresults include: Clearly defining goals and how they will be measured. Attaching positive, negative, and aversive reinforce-ments to adaptive and maladaptive behavior. Using simple, concrete instructions and promptsto elicit the desired behavior. Behavior therapy can be a powerful treatment tool for helping clients change undesirable behaviors. Inthe treatment setting, the health-care provider canuse praise and other positive reinforcements to helpthe client with schizophrenia reduce the frequency ofmaladaptive or deviant behaviors. A limitation of thistype of therapy is the inability of some individuals withschizophrenia to generalize what they have learnedfrom the treatment setting to the community setting. Social Skills Training Social skills training has become one of the mostwidely used psychosocial interventions in the treat-ment of schizophrenia. Mueser, Bond, and Drake(2002) stated: The basic premise of social skills training is that com- plex interpersonal skills involve the smooth integra-tion of a combination of simpler behaviors, includingnonverbal behaviors (e.g., facial expression, eye con-tact); paralinguistic features (e.g., voice loudness and affect); verbal content (i.e., the appropriateness of what is said); and interactive balance (e.g., response latency, amount of time talking). These specific skills can besystematically taught, and, through the process ofshaping (i.e., rewarding successive approximations toward the target behavior), complex behavioralrepertoires can be acquired. Social dysfunction is a hallmark of schizophrenia. Impairment in interpersonal relations is included as part of the defining diagnostic criteria for schizophre-nia in the DSM-5 (APA, 2013). Considerable attention is now being given to enhancement of social skills inthese clients. The educational procedure in social skills training focuses on role-play. A series of brief scenarios are selected. These should be typical of situations clientsexperience in their daily lives and be graduated interms of level of difficulty. The health-care providermay serve as a role model for some behaviors. For ex-ample, \"See how I sort of nod my head up and downand look at your face while you talk.\" This demonstra-tion is followed by the client's role-playing. Immediatefeedback is provided regarding the client's presenta-tion. Only by countless repetitions does the responsegradually become smooth and effortless. Progress is geared toward the client's needs and limitations. The focus is on small units of behavior,and the training proceeds very gradually. Highlythreatening issues are avoided, and emphasis isplaced on functional skills that are relevant to activi-ties of daily living. Social Treatments Milieu Therapy Some clinicians believe that milieu therapy can be anappropriate treatment for the client with schizophre-nia. Research suggests that psychotropic medication ismore effective at all levels of care when used along withmilieu therapy and that milieu therapy is more success-ful if used in conjunction with these medications. Sadock and Sadock (2007) stated: Most milieu therapy programs emphasize group and social interaction; rules and expectations are medi-ated by peer pressure for normalization of adapta-tion. When patients are viewed as responsible humanbeings, the patient role becomes blurred. Milieu ther-apy stresses a patient's rights to goals and to have free-dom of movement and informal relationship withstaff; it also emphasizes interdisciplinary participationand goal-oriented, clear communication. (p. 970) Individuals with schizophrenia who are treated with milieu therapy alone require longer hospital stays than do those treated with drugs and psychoso-cial therapy. Other economic considerations, such asthe need for a high staff-to-client ratio, in addition tothe longer admission, limit the use of milieu therapyin the treatment of schizophrenia. The milieu envi-ronment can be successfully employed in outpatientsettings, however, such as day and partial hospitaliza-tion programs. Family Therapy Some health-care providers treat schizophrenia as an ill-ness not of the client alone, but of the entire family. Evenwhen families appear to cope well, there is a notable impact on the mental health status of relatives when afamily member has the illness. Safier (1997) states: When a family member has a serious mental illness, the family must deal with a major upheaval in their lives, aterrible event that causes great pain and grief for theloss of a once-promising child or relationship. (p. 5)CHAPTER 24 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders 4414092_Ch24_419-457 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 441The importance of the expanded role of family in the aftercare of relatives with schizophrenia has been recognized, thereby stimulating interest in family in-tervention programs designed to support the familysystem, prevent or delay relapse, and help to maintainthe client in the community. These psychoeduca-tional programs treat the family as a resource ratherthan a stressor, with the focus on concrete problemsolving and specific helping behaviors for coping withstress. These programs recognize the biological basisfor schizophrenia and the impact that stress has onthe client's ability to function. By providing the familywith information about the illness and suggestions foreffective coping, psychoeducational programs reducethe likelihood of the client's relapse and the possibleemergence of mental illness in previously nonaffectedrelatives. Mueser and associates (2002) stated that although models of family intervention with schizophrenia differin their characteristics and methods, effective treat-ment programs share a number of common features: All programs are long term (usually 9 months to 2 years or more). They all provide client and family with informationabout the illness and its management. They focus on improving adherence to prescribedmedications. They strive to decrease stress in the family, and improve family functioning. Asen (2002) suggested the following interventions with families of individuals with schizophrenia: Forming a close alliance with the caregivers Lowering the emotional intrafamily climate by reducing stress and burden on relatives Increasing the ability of relatives to anticipate andsolve problems Reducing the expressions of anger and guilt byfamily members Maintaining reasonable expectations for how theill family member should perform Encouraging relatives to set appropriate limitswhile maintaining some degree of separateness Promoting desirable changes in the relatives' behaviors and belief systems Family therapy typically consists of a brief program of family education about schizophrenia, and a moreextended program of family contact designed to re-duce overt manifestations of conflict and to improvepatterns of family communication and problem solv-ing. The response to this type of therapy has beenvery dramatic. Studies have clearly revealed that amore positive outcome in the treatment of the clientwith schizophrenia can be achieved by including thefamily system in the program of care.Program of Assertive Community Treatment (PACT) The Program of Assertive Community Treatment (PACT)is a program of case management that takes a team ap-proach in providing comprehensive, community-basedpsychiatric treatment, rehabilitation, and support to persons with serious and persistent mental illness such as schizophrenia. (The National Alliance on MentalIllness [NAMI] uses the terms PACT and AssertiveCommunity Treatment [ACT] interchangeably. Somestates use other terms for this type of treatment, suchas Mobile Treatment Teams [MTTs] and CommunitySupport Programs [CSPs].) Aggressive programs oftreatment are individually tailored for each client andinclude the teaching of basic living skills, helpingclients work with community agencies, and assistingclients in developing a social support network. Thereis emphasis on vocational expectations, and supportedwork settings (i.e., sheltered workshops) are an impor-tant part of the treatment program. Other services include substance abuse treatment, psychoeducationalprograms, family support and education, mobile crisisintervention, and attention to health-care needs. Responsibilities are shared by multiple team mem- bers, including psychiatrists, nurses, social workers,vocational rehabilitation therapists, and substanceabuse counselors. Services are provided in the per-son's home, within the neighborhood, in local restau-rants, parks, stores, or wherever assistance by theclient is required. These services are available to theclient 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. NAMI (2013)lists the primary goals of ACT as follows: To meet basic needs and enhance quality of life To improve functioning in adult social and employ-ment roles To enhance an individual's ability to live independ-ently in his or her own community To lessen the family's burden of providing care To lessen or eliminate the debilitating symptoms ofmental illness To minimize or prevent recurrent acute episodesof the illness Individuals best served by PACT are identified by the Assertive Community Treatment Association(ACTA) (2013) as follows: Clients served by ACT are individuals with serious and persistent mental illness or personality disorders, withsevere functional impairments, who have avoided ornot responded well to traditional outpatient mentalhealth care and psychiatric rehabilitation services. Per-sons served by ACT often have co-existing problemssuch as homelessness, substance abuse problems, orinvolvement with the judicial system. PACT has been shown to reduce the number of hospitalizations and decrease costs of care for these442 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch24_419-457 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 442clients. Although it has been called \"paternalistic\" and \"coercive\" by its critics, PACT has provided a much-needed service and increased quality of lifeto many clients who are unable to manage in a less-structured environment. The Recovery Model Research provides support for recovery as an obtain-able objective for individuals with schizophrenia(Lysaker, Roe, & Buck, 2010). Lysaker and associates(2010) state: Recovery from schizophrenia, in the sense of a state in which persons experience no difficulties associatedwith the illness, can occur but the modal outcomeseems to be one in which difficulties linked to symp-toms, social function, and work appear periodicallybut can be successfully confronted. (p. 40) Conceptual models of recovery from mental illness are presented in Chapter 21. The recovery model has been used primarily in caring for individuals with serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia andbipolar disorder. However, concepts of the model areamenable to use with all individuals experiencingemotional conditions with which they require assis-tance and who have a desire to take control and man-age their lives more independently. Weiden (2010) identifies two types of recovery with schizophrenia: functional and process. Functional re-covery focuses on the individual's level of functioningin such areas as relationships, work, independent liv-ing, and other kinds of life functioning. He or shemay or may not be experiencing active symptoms ofschizophrenia. Weiden (2010) suggests that recovery can also be considered as a process. With process recovery, thereis no defined endpoint, but recovery is viewed as aprocess that continues throughout the individual'slife, and involves collaboration between client and cli-nician. The individual identifies goals based on per-sonal values or what he or she defines as givingmeaning and purpose to life. The clinician and clientwork together to develop a treatment plan that is inalignment with the goals set forth by the client. In theprocess recovery model, the individual may still be experiencing symptoms. Weiden (2010) states: Patients do not have to be in remission, nor does re- mission automatically have to be a desired (or likely)goal when embarking on a recovery-oriented treat-ment plan. As long as the patient (and family) under-stands that a process recovery treatment plan is not to be confused with a promise of \"cure\" or even\"remission,\" then one does not overpromise. The concept of recovery in schizophrenia remains controversial among clinicians, and many challenges lie ahead for continued study. Currently, there is alack of consistency in what constitutes \"recovery,\" andmany concepts exist. Therefore, it is important to ensure that \"recovery\" is clearly defined anytime it isconsidered as the plan of care. Organic Treatment Psychopharmacology Chlorpromazine (Thorazine) was first introduced inthe United States in 1952. At that time, it was used inconjunction with barbiturates in surgical anesthesia.With increased use, the drug's psychic propertieswere recognized, and by 1954 it was marketed as anantipsychotic medication in the United States. Themanufacture and sale of other antipsychotic drugs followed in rapid succession. Antipsychotic medications are also called neurolep- ticsor major tranquilizers. They are effective in the treatment of acute and chronic manifestations ofschizophrenia and in maintenance therapy to preventexacerbation of schizophrenic symptoms. Withoutdrug treatment, an estimated 72 percent of individu-als who have experienced a psychotic episode relapsewithin a year. This relapse rate can be reduced toabout 23 percent with continuous medication admin-istration (Dixon, Lehman, & Levine, 2010). The prognosis of schizophrenia has often been re- ported in a paradigm of thirds. One-third of the peopleachieve significant and lasting improvement. They maynever experience another episode of psychosis follow-ing the initial occurrence. One-third may achieve someimprovement with intermittent relapses and residualdisability. Their occupational level may have decreasedbecause of their illness, or they may be socially isolated.Finally, one-third experiences severe and permanent in-capacity. They often do not respond to medication andremain severely ill for much of their lives. Men havepoorer outcomes than women do; women respond better to treatment with antipsychotic medications. As mentioned earlier, the efficacy of antipsychotic medications is enhanced by adjunct psychosocialtherapy. Because the psychotic manifestations of the illness subside with use of the drugs, clients aregenerally more cooperative with the psychosocialtherapies. However, it takes several weeks for the an-tipsychotics to effectively treat positive symptoms, afact that often leads to discontinuation of the medica-tion. Clients and families need to be educated aboutthe importance of waiting, often for several weeks, todetermine if the drug will be effective. These medications are classified as either \"typical\" (first-generation, conventional antipsychotics) or \"atyp-ical\" (the newer, novel ofcommonly used antipsychotic agents are presented inTable 24-5. A detailed description of these medicationsfollows.CHAPTER 24 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders 4434092_Ch24_419-457 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 443Indications Antipsychotic medications are used in the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.

Constipation *Order foods high in fiber; encourage increase in physical activity and fluid intake if not con-traindicated. Urinary retention *Instruct client to report any difficulty urinating; monitor intake and output. Nausea; gastrointestinal (GI) upset (may occurwith all classifications)*Tablets or capsules may be administered with food to minimize GI upset.CHAPTER 24 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders 4454092_Ch24_419-457 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 445*Concentrates may be diluted and administered with fruit juice or other liquid; they should be mixed immediately before administration. Skin rash (may occur with all classifications)*Report appearance of any rash on skin to physician.*Avoid spilling any of the liquid concentrate on skin; contact dermatitis can occur with some medications. Sedation (see Table 24-6 for differences betweentypical and atypical antipsychotics)*Discuss with physician the possibility of adminis- tering the drug at bedtime. *Discuss with physician a possible decrease in dosage or an order for a less sedating drug. *Instruct client not to drive or operate dangerous equipment while experiencing sedation. Orthostatic hypotension (see Table 26-6 for differ-ences between typical and atypical antipsychotics)*Instruct client to rise slowly from a lying or sitting position. *Monitor blood pressure (lying and standing) each shift; document and report significant changes. Photosensitivity (may occur with all classifications)*Ensure that the client wears a sunblock lotion, protective clothing, and sunglasses while spend-ing time outdoors.Hormonal effects (may occur with all classifications,but more common with typical antipsychotics) Decreased libido, retrograde ejaculation (the dis- charge of seminal fluid into the bladder ratherthan through the urethra), gynecomastia (men) *Provide explanation of the effects and reassur- ance of reversibility. If necessary, discuss withphysician possibility of ordering alternate med-ication. Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) (women) *Offer reassurance of client to continue use of contraception, be-cause amenorrhea does not indicate cessation of ovulation. Weight gain (may occur with all classifications;has been problematic with the atypical antipsy-chotics) *Weigh client every other day; order calorie- controlled diet; provide opportunity for physicalexercise; provide diet and exercise instruction.

Conditions that produce hypokalemiaand/or hypomagnesemia, such as diuretic therapyor diarrhea, should be taken into considerationwhen prescribing. Routine ECG should be per-formed before initiation of therapy and periodicallyduring therapy. Clozapine has also been associatedwith other cardiac events, such as ischemic changes,arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, myocarditis,and cardiomyopathy.*Monitor vital signs every shift.*Observe for symptoms of dizziness, palpitations, syn- cope, weakness, dyspnea, and peripheral edema. Reduction of seizure threshold (more commonwith the typical than the atypical antipsychotics,with the exception of clozapine)*Closely observe clients with history of seizures. Note: This is particularly important with clients taking clozapine (Clozaril), with which seizureshave been frequently associated. Dose appears tobe an important predictor, with a greater likeli-hood of seizures occurring at higher doses. Ex-treme caution is advised in prescribing clozapinefor clients with a history of seizures. Agranulocytosis (more common with the typical than the atypical antipsychotics, with the exceptionof clozapine)*Agranulocytosis usually occurs within the first 3 months of treatment. Observe for symptoms ofsore throat, fever, malaise. A complete blood countshould be monitored if these symptoms appear. *EXCEPTION: There is a significant risk of agran- ulocytosis with clozapine (Clozaril). Agranulocyto-sis is a potentially fatal blood disorder in which theclient's white blood cell (WBC) count can drop toextremely low levels. A baseline WBC count andabsolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be takenbefore initiation of treatment with clozapine andweekly for the first 6 months of treatment. Only a1-week supply of medication is dispensed at a time.If the counts remain within the acceptable levels(i.e., WBC at least 3,500/mm 3and the ANC at least 2,000/mm3) during the 6-month period, blood counts may be monitored biweekly, and a 2-weeksupply of medication may then be dispensed. Ifthe counts remain within the acceptable level forthe biweekly period (6 months), counts may thenbe monitored every 4 weeks thereafter. When themedication is discontinued, weekly WBC countsare continued for an additional 4 weeks. Hypersalivation (most common with clozapine)*A significant number of clients receiving clozapine (Clozaril) therapy experience extreme salivation.Offer support to the client because this may be anembarrassing situation. It may even be a safetyissue (e.g., risk of aspiration) if the problem is verysevere. Management has included the use of sugar-free gum to increase the swallowing rate, as well asthe prescription of medications such as an anti-cholinergic (e.g., scopolamine patch) or alpha 2- adrenoceptor agonist (e.g., clonidine). Extrapyramidal symptoms (see Table 24-6 for between typical and atypical antipsychotics)*Observe for symptoms and report; administer an- tiparkinsonian drugs, as ordered (see Table 24-7). Pseudoparkinsonism (tremor, shuffling gait, drooling, rigidity) *Symptoms may appear 1 to 5 days following ini- tiation of antipsychotic medication; occurs mostoften in women, the dehydratedclients. (muscular weakness) *Same as for pseudoparkinsonism. Akathisia (continuous and fidgeting) *This occurs most frequently in women; symp- toms may occur 50 to 60 days following initia-tion of therapy. Dystonia (involuntary muscular movements [spasms] of face, arms, legs, and neck) *This occurs most often in men and in people younger than 25 years of age. Oculogyric crisis (uncontrolled rolling back of the eyes) *This may appear as part of the syndrome de- scribed as dystonia. It may be mistaken forseizure activity. Dystonia and oculogyric crisisshould be treated as an emergency situation. Thephysician should be contacted, and intravenousbenztropine mesylate (Cogentin) is commonlyadministered. Stay with the client and offer reas-surance and support during this frighteningtime. Tardive dyskinesia (bizarre facial and tongue move- ments, stiff neck, and difficulty swallowing; mayoccur with all classifications, but more commonwith typical antipsychotics)*All clients receiving long-term (months or years) antipsychotic therapy are at risk. *The symptoms are potentially irreversible.*The drug should be withdrawn at the first sign, which is usually vermiform movements of thetongue; prompt action may prevent irreversibility. *The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) is a rating scale that was developed in the1970s by the National Institute of Mental Healthto measure involuntary movements associatedwith tardive dyskinesia.

Ask client to remove shoes and socks. 2. Ask client whether there is anything in his/her mouth (i.e., gum, candy, etc.), and if there is, to remove it. 3. Ask client about the current condition of his/her teeth. Ask client if he/she wears dentures. Do teeth or dentures bother client now? 4. Ask client whether he/she notices any movements in mouth, face, hands, or feet. If yes, ask to describe and to what extent they currently bother client or interfere with his/her activities. 5. Have client sit in chair with both hands on knees, legs slightly apart, and feet flat on floor. (Look at entire body for mo ve- ments while in this position.) 6. Ask client to sit with hands hanging unsupported. If male, between legs, if female and wearing a dress, hanging over knees. (Observe hands and other body areas.) 7. Ask client to open mouth. (Observe tongue at rest within mouth.) Do this twice. 8. Ask client to protrude tongue. (Observe abnormalities of tongue movement.) Do this twice. 9. Ask client to tap thumb with each finger as rapidly as possible for 10 to 15 seconds; separately with right hand, then with left hand. (Observe facial and leg movements.) 10. Flex and extend client's left and right arms (one at a time). (Note any rigidity.)11. Ask client to stand up. (Observe in profile. Observe all body areas again, hips included.)12. Ask client to extend both arms outstretched in front with palms down. (Observe trunk, legs, and mouth.)13. Have client walk a few paces, turn, and walk back to chair. (Observe hands and gait.)

Hyperglycemia and diabetes (more common withatypical antipsychotics). Studies have suggested anincreased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related Administration (FDA)recommends that clients with diabetes starting onatypical antipsychotic drugs be monitored regularlyfor worsening of glucose control. Clients with riskfactors for diabetes should undergo fasting bloodglucose testing at the beginning of treatment andperiodically thereafter. All clients taking these med-ications should be monitored for symptoms of hy-perglycemia (polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, andweakness). If these symptoms appear during treat-ment, the client should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. Increased risk of mortality in elderly patients with psychosis related to neurocognitive disorder(NCD). Studies have indicated that elderly patientswith NCD-related psychosis who are treated withantipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death,compared with placebo. Causes of death are mostcommonly related to infections or cardiovascularproblems. All antipsychotic drugs now carry black-box warnings to this effect. They are not approvedfor treatment of elderly patients with NCD-relatedpsychosis. Client/Family Education Related to Antipsychotics The client should: Use caution when driving or operating dangerous machinery. Drowsiness and dizziness can occur. Not stop taking the drug abruptly after long-term use.To do so might produce withdrawal symptoms, suchas nausea, vomiting, dizziness, gastritis, headache,tachycardia, insomnia, tremulousness.Use sunblock lotion and wear protective clothingwhen spending time outdoors. Skin is more suscep-tible to sunburn, which can occur in as little as 30 minutes. Report weekly (if receiving clozapine therapy) to have blood levels drawn and to obtain a weeklysupply of the drug. Report the occurrence of any of the following symp-toms to the physician immediately: sore throat,fever, malaise, unusual bleeding, easy bruising, per-sistent nausea and vomiting, severe headache, rapidheart rate, difficulty urinating, muscle twitching,tremors, darkly colored urine, excessive urination,excessive thirst, excessive hunger, weakness, palestools, yellow skin or eyes, muscular incoordination,or skin rash. Rise slowly from a sitting or lying position to pre-vent a sudden drop in blood pressure. Take frequent sips of water, chew sugarless gum, orsuck on hard candy, if dry mouth is a problem.Good oral care (frequent brushing, flossing) is veryimportant. Consult the physician regarding smoking while on antipsychotic therapy. Smoking increases the metabolism of antipsychotics, requiring an adjust-ment in dosage to achieve a therapeutic effect. Dress warmly in cold weather, and avoid ex-tended exposure to very high or low tempera-tures. Body temperature is harder to maintainwith this medication. Avoid drinking alcohol while on antipsychotic ther-apy. These drugs potentiate each other's effects. Avoid taking other medications (including over-the-counter products) without the physician's ap-proval. Many medications contain substances thatinteract with antipsychotics in a way that may beharmful. Be aware of possible risks of taking antipsychoticsduring pregnancy. Safe use during pregnancy hasnot been established. Antipsychotics are thought toreadily cross the placental barrier; if so, a fetus couldexperience adverse effects of the drug. Inform thephysician immediately if pregnancy occurs, is sus-pected, or is planned. Be aware of side effects of antipsychotic drugs.Refer to written materials furnished by health-careproviders for safe self-administration. Continue to take the medication, even if feelingwell and as though it is not needed. Symptoms mayreturn if medication is discontinued. Carry a card or other identification at all times describing medications being taken.450 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch24_419-457 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 450CHAPTER 24 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders 451 CASE STUDY AND SAMPLE CARE PLAN NURSING HISTORY AND ASSESSMENT Frank is 22 years old. He joined the Marines just out of high school at age 18 for a 3-year enlistment. His final yearwas spent in Afghanistan. When his 3-year enlistment wasup, he returned to his hometown and married a youngwoman with whom he had been a high school classmate.Frank has always been quiet, somewhat withdrawn, andhad very few friends. He was the only child of a singlemom who never married, and he does not know his father. His mother was killed in an automobile accidentthe spring before he enlisted in the Marines. During the past year, he has become more and more iso- lated and withdrawn. He is without regular employment, butfinds work as a day laborer when he can. His wife, Suzanne,works as a secretary and is the primary wage earner. Latelyhe has become very suspicious of her, and sometimes fol-lows her to work. He also drops in on her at work and ac-cuses her of having affairs with some of the men in the office. Last evening when Suzanne got home from work, Frank was hiding in the closet. She didn't know he was home.When she started to undress, he jumped out of the closetholding a large kitchen knife and threatened to kill her \"forbeing unfaithful.\" Suzanne managed to flee their home andran to the neighbor's house and called the police. Frank told the police that he received a message over the radio from his Marine commanding officer telling himthat he couldn't allow his wife to continue to commit adul-tery, and the only way he could stop it was to kill her. Thepolice took Frank to the emergency department of the VAHospital, where he was admitted to the psychiatric unit.Suzanne is helping with the admission history. Suzanne tells the nurse that she has never been un- faithful to Frank and she doesn't know why he believesthat she has. Frank tells the nurse that he has been \"takingorders from my commanding officer through my car radioever since I got back from Afghanistan.\" He survived a hel-icopter crash in Afghanistan in which all were killed exceptFrank and one other man. Frank says, \"I have to follow myCO's orders. God saved me to annihilate the impure.\" Following an evaluation, the psychiatrist diagnoses Frank with schizophrenia. He orders olanzapine 10 mg PO to begiven daily and olanzapine 10 mg IM q6h prn for agitation. NURSING DIAGNOSES/OUTCOME IDENTIFICATION From the assessment data, the nurse develops the following nursing diagnoses for Frank: 1.Risk for self-directed or other-directed violence re- lated to unresolved g rief over loss of mother; survivor's guilt associated with helicopter crash; command hallu- cinations; and history of violence. a. Short-Term Goals: Frank will seek out staff when anxiety and agitationstart to increase. Frank will not harm self or others. b. Long-Term Goal: Frank will not harm self or others.2.Disturbed sensory perception: Auditory related to in- creased anxiety and ag itation, withdrawal into self , and stress of sufficient intensity to threaten an already weak ego. a. Short-Term Goals: Frank will discuss the content of the hallucinationswith the nurse. Frank will maintain anxiety at a manageable level. b. Long-Term Goal: Frank will be able to define and test reality, reducing or eliminating the occurrence ofhallucinations. PLANNING/IMPLEMENTATION RISK FOR SELF-DIRECTED OR OTHER-DIRECTED VIOLENCE 1.Keep the stimuli as low as possible in Frank's environment. 2.Monitor Frank's behavior frequently, but in a manner of carrying out routine activities so as not to create suspi-ciousness on his par t. 3.W atch for the following signs (considered the prodrome to agg ressive behavior: increased motor activity , pound- ing, slamming, tense posture, defiant affect, clenchedteeth and fists, arguing, demanding, and challenging orthreatening staff). 4.If client should become aggressive, maintain a calm at-titude. T ry talking. Offer medication. Provide physical activities. 5.If these interventions fail, indicate a show of streng th with a team of staff members. 6.Utilize restraints only as a last resort and if Frank isclearly at risk of harm to himself or others. 7.Help Frank recognize unresolved grief and fixation indenial or anger stage of g rief process. 8.Encourage him to talk about the loss of his mother andfellow Marines in Afghanistan. 9.Encourage him to talk about guilt feelings associatedwith survival when others died. 10 .Make a short-term contract with Frank that he will seekout staff if considering harming himself or others. W hen this contract expires, make another , etc. DISTURBED SENSORY PERCEPTION: AUDITORY 1.Monitor Frank's behavior for signs that he is hearingvoices: listening pose, talking and laughing to self, stop- ping in midsentence. 2.If these behaviors are observed, ask F rank, \"Are you hearing the voices again?\" 3.Encourage Frank to share the content of the hallucina-tions. T his is impor tant for early intervention in case the content contains commands to harm himself orothers. 4.Say to Frank, \"I understand that the voice is real to you,but I do not hear any voices speaking. \" It is impor tant for him to learn the difference between what is real and whatis not real. 5.Try to help Frank recognize that the voices often appearat times when he becomes anxious about something andhis ag itation increases.

In-volvement with real people and real situations will helpto distract him from the hallucination. 8.Teach him to use voice dismissal. When he hears the C O's (or others') voice, he should shout, \"Go away!\" or \"Leave me alone!\" These commands may help to dimin-ish the sounds and give him a feeling of control over thesituation.EVALUATION The outcome criteria identified for Frank have been met.When feeling especially anxious or becoming agitated, heseeks out staff for comfort and for assistance in maintaininghis anxiety at a manageable level. He establishes short-termcontracts with staff not to harm himself. He is experiencingfewer auditory hallucinations, and has learned to use voicedismissal to interrupt the behavior. He is beginning to rec-ognize his position in the grief process, and working towardresolution at his own pace. Summary and Key Points Of all mental illness, schizophrenia undoubtedly results in the greatest amount of personal, emo-tional, and social costs. It presents an enormousthreat to life and happiness, yet it remains anenigma to the medical community. For many years there was little agreement as to adefinition of the concept of schizophrenia. TheDSM-5 (APA, 2013) identifies specific criteria for diagnosis of the disorder. The initial symptoms of schizophrenia most oftenoccur in early adulthood. Development of the dis-order can be viewed in four phases: (1) the premor-bid phase, (2) the prodromal phase, (3) the activepsychotic phase (schizophrenia), and (4) the resid-ual phase. The cause of schizophrenia remains unclear. Research continues, and most contemporary psychi-atrists view schizophrenia as a brain disorder with lit-tle if any emphasis on psychosocial influences. Schizophrenia most likely results from a combinationof influences including genetics, biochemical dysfunc-tion, and physiological and environmental factors. A spectrum of schizophrenic and other psychoticdisorders has been identified. These include (on agradient of psychopathology from least to most se-vere): schizotypal personality disorder, delusionaldisorder, brief psychotic disorder, substance-induced psychotic disorder, psychotic disorder as-sociated with another medical condition, catatonicdisorder associated with another medical condi-tion, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffectivedisorder, and schizophrenia. Nursing care of the client with schizophrenia is ac-complished using the six steps of the nursing process. Nursing assessment is based on knowledge ofsymptomatology related to thought content andform, perception, affect, sense of self, volition, interpersonal functioning and relationship to theexternal world, and psychomotor behavior. These behaviors are categorized as positive (an ex- cess or distortion of normal functions) or negative (a diminution or loss of normal functions). Antipsychotic medications remain the mainstay oftreatment for psychotic disorders. Atypical antipsy-chotics have become the first-line of therapy, andtreat both positive and negative symptoms of schizo-phrenia. They have a more favorable side-effect pro-file than the conventional (typical) antipsychotics. Individuals with schizophrenia require long-termintegrated treatment with pharmacological andother interventions. Some of these include individ-ual psychotherapy, group therapy, behavior therapy,social skills training, milieu therapy, family therapy,and assertive community treatment. For the major-ity of clients, the most effective treatment appearsto be a combination of psychotropic medicationand psychosocial therapy. Some clinicians are choosing a course of therapybased on a model of recovery, somewhat like thatwhich has been used for many years with problemsof addiction. The basic premise of a recovery modelis empowerment of the consumer. The recoverymodel is designed to allow consumers primary con-trol over decisions about their own care, and to en-able persons with mental health problems to live ameaningful life in a community of their choicewhile striving to achieve their full potential. Families generally require support and educationabout psychotic illnesses. The focus is on copingwith the diagnosis, understanding the illness andits course, teaching about medication, and learn-ing ways to manage symptoms.

(2002). Behavioral management ofpersistent auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia:Outcomes from a 10-week course. Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association, 8 (3), 84-91. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a 1 0 -week course in which be- havior management strategies were taught to participantswith schizophrenia who experienced persistent auditoryhallucinations. The primary aim was to examine the effectsof the intervention on seven specific characteristics of au-ditory hallucinations: frequency, loudness, self-control, clar-ity, tone, distractibility, and distress. The secondary aim wasto examine level of anxiety and depression. The sampleconsisted of 62 subjects who had been diagnosed withschizophrenia by a board-certified psychiatrist using DSM-IVdiagnostic criteria. They all reported having persistent audi-tory hallucinations for at least 10 minutes a day for the past3 months; reported a desire to learn new strategies tomanage their auditory hallucinations; were taking stabledoses of antipsychotic medication for at least 4 weeks before entry into the study; were able to read and write in English; and did not have a severe cognitive deficit. The10-week course was taught in 9 different outpatient settings by nurses who had experience caring for patientswith schizophrenia and were knowledgeable in group facil-itation skills. In each class, participants were taught and prac-ticed one behavior strategy. The following strategies weretaught in the course: self-monitoring, talking with someone,listening to music with or without earphones, watching television, saying \"stop\"/ignoring what the voices say to do,using ear plugs, learning relaxation techniques, keeping busywith an enjoyable activity and/or helping others, and prac-ticing communication related to taking medication and notusing drugs and alcohol. Measurement of the outcomeswere based on subjects' scores on the Characteristics of Auditory Hallucinations Questionnaire (CAHQ), the Profileof Mood States (POMS) scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory, second edition (BDI-II). RESULTS OF THE STUDY: The outcome of this study strongly suppor ted the expectation that subjects who attended the behavior-management strateg y classes for auditory halluci- nations would experience improvement in the characteristics of their auditory hallucinations and have less anxiety and de-pression. Post-intervention scores on the POMS and BDI-IIwere significantly lower than pre-intervention scores, indicat-ing an overall decrease in anxiety and depression. Post-intervention mean scores on the CAHQ were significantly 4092_Ch24_419-457 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 454CHAPTER 24 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders 455 IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE\u2014 cont'd lower than pre-intervention on all hallucination characteris- tics, with the exception of loudness, which did not changesignificantly. In a 5-point self-report rating helpfulness of thecourse, 25% of the participants reported that the coursewas extremely helpful, 42% reported that it was helpful, 23% moderately helpful , 8% minimally helpful, and 2% not helpful. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: This study shows that individuals can manage their auditory hallucinations by learning and using specific behavioral strateg ies. T he group setting also proved to be beneficial, as clients were able tohave their own experiences validated, to see that others hadsimilar experiences, and to learn how others managedthem. They gained encouragement and hope from learningthat certain strategies were effective for others in the group.The authors stated, \"This low cost, low-tech interventioncould be incorporated into the practice of psychiatric nursesor other mental health professionals who have group train-ing and experience facilitating groups with people who haveschizophrenia. Teaching behavior management of persistentauditory hallucinations to clients who wish to learn has minimal risks and could be easily incorporated into existingoutpatient programs\" (p. 90).

Telenursing inter-vention increases psychiatric medication adherence in schizophrenia outpatients. Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association, 14 (3), 217-224. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of telephone intervention problemsolving (TI P S), a problem-based telenursing intervention, on both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric medication adher-ence in outpatients with schizophrenia. The study sampleincluded 25 outpatients (age range 25 to 69) receivingcare at a Community Mental Health Center (CMHC) in thesoutheastern United States; 60% were male and 44%were African American. The majority lived alone and wereunemployed. All had chart diagnoses of schizophrenia (anysubtype) according to the criteria in the DMS-IV-TR. Thirteen study participants and 12 control subjects completed theresearch study. The intervention included weekly telephonecalls throughout the 3-month study by registered nurseswith graduate degrees who had received TIPS training fromone of the authors. The calls were designed \"to foster prob-lem solving, offer coping alternatives, provide reminders soclients remember to use alternatives, and assess the effec-tiveness of coping efforts. Effective use of problem solvingmay assist patients to cope with common medication ad-herence barriers such as forgetfulness or lack of knowledgeabout prescribed medications. Nurses guide the participantthrough the problem-solving process for any difficulties iden-tified, generating solutions, choosing a solution, and follow-ing up on the effectiveness of the solution at the next call\"(p. 220). Medication adherence was measured by pillcounts performed monthly in the participants' homes. Bothpsychiatric and nonpsychiatric medications were counted. RESULTS OF THE STUDY: As had been expected, there was a statistically significant improvement in adherence to psychi-atric medications in the experimental g roup compared to the control g roup. However, nonpsychiatric medication ad- herence was not significantly affected by the TIPS interven-tion. The authors suggest that this may have occurred\"because participants were recruited at a CMHC, they asso-ciated TIPS providers with the CMHC and tended to gener-alize adherence suggestions to psychiatric medications forthis reason\" (p. 223). IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The telenursing intervention described in this study may provide nurses with a tool for assisting clients with schizophrenia to maintaingreater medication adherence. Prior work by the primary author demonstrated fewer rehospitalizations in persons receiving TIPS, indicating that there is a strong associationbetween lack of psychiatric medication adherence andsymptom relapse and psychiatric readmission. TIPS may beconsidered as part of an outpatient or partial hospitalizationprogram for clients with schizophrenia.4092_Ch24_419-457 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 455References Addington, D.E. (2006).

They explain that over the past few monthsshe has become more and more withdrawn. She stays in her roomalone, but lately has been heard talking and laughing to herself. Sara left home for the first time at age 18 to attend college. She performed well during her first semester, but when she returnedafter Christmas, she began to accuse her roommate of stealing herpossessions. She started writing to her parents that her roommatewanted to kill her and that her roommate was turning everyoneagainst her. She said she feared for her life. She started missingclasses and stayed in her bed most of the time. Sometimes shelocked herself in her closet. Her parents took her home, and shewas hospitalized and diagnosed with schizophrenia. She has sincebeen maintained on antipsychotic medication while taking a fewclasses at the local community college. Sara tells the admitting nurse that she quit taking her medication 4 weeks ago because the pharmacist who fills the prescriptions isplotting to have her killed. She believes he is trying to poison her.She says she got this information from a television message. AsSara speaks, the nurse notices that she sometimes stops in mid-sentence and listens; sometimes she cocks her head to the sideand moves her lips as though she is talking. Answer the following questions related to Sara: 1.From the assessment data, what would be the most immedi-ate nursing concern in working with Sara? 2.What is the nursing diagnosis related to this concern? 3.What interventions must be accomplished before the nursecan be successful in working with Sara? Communication Exercises 1.Hal, a patient on the psychiatric unit, has a diagno- sis of schizophrenia. He lives in a halfway house,where last evening he began yelling that \"alienswere on the way to take over our bodies! The message is coming through loud and clear!\" Theresidence supervisor became frightened and called911. Hal tells the nurse, \"I'm special! I get messagesfrom a higher being! We are in for big trouble!\" How would the nurse respond appropriately to this statement by Hal? 2.The nurse notices that Hal is sitting off to himself ina corner of the dayroom. He appears to be talkingto himself and tilts his head to the side as if listen-ing to something. How would the nurse intervene with Hal in this situation? 3.Hal says to the nurse, \"We must choose to take aride. All alone we slip and slide. Now it's time totake a bride.\" How would the nurse respond appropriately to this statement by Hal? 4092_Ch24_419-457 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 456Minzenberg, M.J., R.E. Hales, S.C.

Symptomsof depression have been described almost as far backas there is evidence of written documentation. An occasional bout with the \"blues,\" a feeling of sadness or downheartedness, is common amonghealthy people and considered to be a normal re-sponse to everyday disappointments in life. Theseepisodes are short-lived as the individual adapts to theloss, change, or failure (real or perceived) that hasbeen experienced. Pathological depression occurswhen adaptation is ineffective.A clearly nondivine point of view regarding depres- sion was held by the Greek medical community fromthe 5th century BCthrough the 3rd century AD. This represented the thinking of Hippocrates, Celsus, andGalen, among others. They strongly rejected the ideaof divine origin and considered the brain as the seatof all emotional states. Hippocrates believed thatmelancholia was caused by an excess of black bile, a heavily toxic substance produced in the spleen or in-testine, which affected the brain. Melancholia is a se-vere form of depressive disorder in which symptomsare exaggerated and interest or pleasure in virtuallyall activities is lost. During the Renaissance, several new theories evolved. Depression was viewed by some as being theresult of obstruction of vital air circulation, excessivebrooding, or helpless situations beyond the client'scontrol. Depression was reflected in major literaryworks of the time, including Shakespeare's King Lear , Macbeth , and Hamlet. Contemporary thinking has been shaped a great deal by the works of Sigmund Freud, Emil Kraepelin,and Adolf Meyer. Having evolved from these early20th-century models, current thinking about mooddisorders generally encompasses the intrapsychic, be-havioral, and biological perspectives. These variousperspectives support the notion of multiple causationin the development of mood disorders. Epidemiology Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the lead-ing causes of disability in the United States. In 2012,6.9 percent of persons aged 18 or older (16 millionpersons) had at least one major depressive episode inthe past year (Substance Abuse and Mental HealthServices Administration [SAMHSA], 2013). Duringtheir lifetime, about 21 percent of women and 13 per-cent of men will become clinically depressed. Thispreponderance has led to the consideration of de-pression by some researchers as \"the common cold ofpsychiatric disorders\" and this generation as an \"ageof melancholia.\" Age and Gender Research indicates that the incidence of depressivedisorder is higher in women than it is in men by al-most 2 to 1. Women experience more depressionthan men beginning at about age 10 and continuingthrough midlife (Kornstein, 2006). The gender dif-ference is less pronounced between ages 44 and 65,but after the age of 65, women are again more likelyto be depressed than men. This occurrence may berelated to gender differences in social roles and eco-nomic and social opportunities and the shifts thatCHAPTER 25 Depressive Disorders 459 CORE CONCEPT Mood Also called affect. Mood is a pervasive and sustained emotion that may have a major influence on a person'sperception of the world. Examples of mood include depression, joy, elation, anger, and anxiety. Affect is described as the emotional reaction associated with anexperience. This chapter focuses on the consequences of com- plicated grieving as it is manifested by depression. A historical perspective and epidemiological statisticsrelated to depression are presented. Predisposing factors that have been implicated in the etiology ofdepression provide a framework for studying the dynamics of the disorder. The implications of depression relevant to individ- uals of various developmental stages are discussed. Anexplanation of the symptomatology is presented asbackground knowledge for assessing the client withdepression. Nursing care is described in the contextof the six steps of the nursing process. Various med-ical treatment modalities are explored. CORE CONCEPT Depression An alteration in mood that is expressed by feelings of sadness, despair, and pessimism. There is a loss of in-terest in usual activities, and somatic symptoms maybe evident. Changes in appetite and sleep patterns arecommon. Historical Perspective Many ancient cultures (e.g., Babylonian, Egyptian, He- brew) have believed in the supernatural or divine originof mood disorders. The Old Testament states in theBook of Samuel that King Saul's depression was inflictedby an spirit\" sent \"torment\" him.4092_Ch25_458-497 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 459occur with age. The construction of gender stereo- types, or gender socialization , promotes typical female characteristics, such as helplessness, passivity, andemotionality, which are associated with depression. Incontrast, some studies have suggested that \"mascu-line\" characteristics are associated with higher self-esteem and less depression. Social Class Results of studies have indicated an inverse relation-ship between social class and report of depressivesymptoms. However, there has yet to be a definitivecausal structure in the socioeconomic status-mentalillness relationship. Hudson (2005) stated: Do poor socioeconomic conditions predispose people to mental disability? Or do preexisting, bi-ologically based mental illnesses result in the driftof individuals into poor socioeconomic circum-stances? (p. 3) Hudson (2005) reported that both depression and personality disorders have most commonly been found to be outcomes of low socioeconomicstatus.Race and Culture Studies have shown no consistent relationship be-tween race and affective disorder. One problem en-countered in reviewing racial comparisons has to dowith the socioeconomic class of the race being inves-tigated. Sample populations of nonwhite clients aremany times predominantly lower class and are oftencompared with white populations from middle andupper social classes. Other studies suggest a second problematic factor in the study of racial comparisons. Clinicians tend tounderdiagnose mood disorders and to overdiagnoseschizophrenia in clients who have racial or culturalbackgrounds different from their own (Sadock andSadock, 2007). This misdiagnosis may result from lan-guage barriers between clients and physicians who areunfamiliar with cultural aspects of nonwhite clients'language and behavior. Findings from the SAMHSA National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2013) reveal that depression is more prevalent in whites than it is in blacks. However,Williams and associates (2007) report that depressiontends to be more severe, persistent, and disabling inblacks, and they are less likely to be treated.

Negative thinking and the mental health of low-incomesingle mothers. Journal of Nursing Scholarship, (36) 4, 337-344. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: The aims of this study were to: (1) examine the prevalence of a high level of depressive symptoms in low-income, single mothers with children 2 to6 years of age; (2) evaluate the relationships of personal sociodemog raphic characteristics with self-esteem, chronic stressors, negative thinking, and depressive symptoms; and(3) determine whether negative thinking mediates the effectsof self-esteem and chronic stressors on depressive symp-toms. Single mothers are a particularly high-risk group for clin-ical depression because of life circumstances such as poverty,low self-esteem, and few social resources. The average ageof the mothers in the study was 27 years. The ethnicity ofthe sample was approximately half Caucasian and half AfricanAmerican. The majority had never been married; most wereemployed, but had annual incomes at or below $15,000. TheBeck Depression Inventory was used to measure symptomsof depression, the Crandell Cognitions Inventory was used tomeasure negative thoughts, and the Rosenberg Self-EsteemScale was used to measure self-worth and self-acceptance. RESULTS OF THE STUDY: More than 75 percent of the mothers scored somewhere in the mild to high range for depression.Negative thinking mediated the effect of self-esteem on de- pressive symptoms and par tially mediated the effect of chronic stressors. T hose subjects who were employed measured higher self-esteem, less negative thinking, fewer chronic stres-sors, and less depression. No differences in predictors of depression were found between Caucasian and African American mothers in this study. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The results of this study suggest the impor tance of intervening to address negative thinking among low-income single mothers to help them lessen their stress and decrease their risk ofdepression. T he authors state, \"Depression may interfere with parenting and participation in educational and em-ployment opportunities, significantly undermining thequality of life in these families. A number of studies haveindicated that mothers' depression may also negatively in-fluence their children's behavior.\" Psychiatric nurses mayemploy cognitive-behavioral strategies to help womenminimize negative thinking. Strategies such as writing affirmations and use of positive self-talk have been sup-ported in nursing research. Targeting the symptom of neg-ative thinking, which can be modified, may serve to breakthe links of chronic stressors and low self-esteem to depressive symptoms, resulting in improved mentalhealth for the mother and the subsequent well-being ofher children.4092_Ch25_458-497 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 460study they found that, even among blacks whose symptoms were rated severe or very severe, only 48.5 percent of African Americans and 21.9 percentof Caribbean blacks received any treatment at all. Theauthors concluded that these findings highlight theimportance of identifying high-risk subgroups inracial populations and the need for targeting cost-effective interventions to them. Marital Status A number of studies have suggested that marriage hasa positive effect on the psychological well-being of anindividual (as compared to those who are single or donot have a close relationship with another person).LaPierre (2004) suggested that marital status alonemay lack validity, and that the effect of marital statuson depression may be contingent on age. She foundin her study that being single was a significant predic-tor of depression in the 37- to 49-year-old age group,but was not a significant predictor of depression inany of the other age groups (18 to 25; 26 to 36; 50+).She explained her findings in the following way: The realization that the normative ideal of marriage (and accompanying children) is becoming a remotepossibility is likely to occur in the 37-49 year old agegroup, causing a decrease in mental health and corre-sponding increase in depressive symptomatology. Thisis particularly true for women who reach the end oftheir childbearing years in this age category, and feelthey may have to forfeit the normative role of mother-hood if they do not find a partner to have a child with.The subsequent decline in depressive symptomatology(observed in the 50+ age group) could occur becausewith time the never-married/childless individual comesto accept their non-normative behavior and find waysto adjust. (p. 14) Other studies also have indicated that age may mod- erate the effect of marital status on depression. George (1992) found that marriage (versus separated/divorced) had a protective effect against major de-pression only in the oldest age category (65+). Herresults also showed that being never married (versusseparated/divorced) was associated with increasedrisk of major depression in the 40- to 64-year-old agegroup and the 65+ age group. Seasonality A number of studies have examined seasonal patternsassociated with mood disorders. These studies have re-vealed two prevalent periods of seasonal involvement:one in the spring (March, April, and May) and one inthe fall (September, October, and November). This pat-tern tends to parallel the seasonal pattern for suicide,which shows a large peak in the spring and a smaller onein October (Davidson, 2005). A number of etiologies associated with this trend have been postulated (Hakko,2000). Some of these include the following: A meteorological factor, associating drastic temper-ature and barometric pressure changes to humanmental instability Sociodemographic variables, such as the seasonal in-crease in social intercourse (e.g., increased social ac-tivity with the commencement of an academic year) Biochemical variables due to possible seasonalvariations in peripheral and central aspects ofserotonergic function involved in depression andsuicide Types of Depressive Disorders Major Depressive Disorder Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized bydepressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in usualactivities. Evidence will show impaired social and occupational functioning that has existed for at least2 weeks, no history of manic behavior, and symptomsthat cannot be attributed to use of substances or a gen-eral medical condition. Additionally, the diagnosis ofMDD is specified according to whether it is a single episode (the individual's first encounter with a major depressive episode) or recurrent (the individual has a history of previous major depressive episodes). The di-agnosis will also identify the degree of severity of symp-toms (mild, moderate, or severe) and whether thereis evidence of psychotic, catatonic, or melancholic fea-tures. The presence of anxiety and severity of suiciderisk may also be noted. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (APA, 2013) diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorderare presented in Box 25-1. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) Characteristics of dysthymia are similar to, if some- what milder than, those ascribed to MDD. Individualswith this mood disturbance describe their mood assad or \"down in the dumps.\" There is no evidence ofpsychotic symptoms. The essential feature is a chron-ically depressed mood (or possibly an irritable moodin children or adolescents) for most of the day, moredays than not, for at least 2 years (1 year for childrenand adolescents). The diagnosis is identified as early onset (occurring before age 21 years) or late onset (oc- curring at age 21 years or older). The DSM-5 diagnos- tic criteria for dysthymia are presented in Box 25-2. Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder The essential features of premenstrual dysphoric dis- order include markedly depressed mood, excessive anxiety, mood swings, and decreased interest in ac-tivities during the week prior to menses, improvingCHAPTER 25 Depressive Disorders 4614092_Ch25_458-497 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 461462 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation BOX 25-1 Diagnostic Criteria for Major Depressive Disorder A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of thesymptoms is either (1) depressed mood, or (2) loss ofinterest or pleasure. Note: Do not include symptoms that are clearly due to another medical condition. 1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad,empty, or hopeless) or observation made by others(e.g., appears tearful). Note: In children and adoles- cents, can be irritable mood. 2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or al- most all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (asindicated by either subjective account or observation). 3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in amonth), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly everyday. Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain. 4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day. 5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelingsof restlessness or being slowed down). 6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. 7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (notmerely self-reproach or guilt about being sick). 8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisive- ness, nearly every day (either by subjective account oras observed by others). 9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), re- current suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a sui-cide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areasof functioning.C. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. Note: Criteria A-C represent a major depressive episode. Note: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereave- ment, financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a seri-ous medical illness or disability) may include the feelingsof intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia,poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion A, whichmay resemble a depressive episode. Although such symp-toms may be understandable or considered appropriateto the loss, the presence of a major depressive episodein addition to the normal response to a significant lossshould also be carefully considered.

The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for premen- strual dysphoric disorder are presented in Box 25-3. Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder The symptoms associated with a substance/medication- induced depressive disorder are considered to be thedirect result of physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,a drug of abuse, a medication, or toxin exposure), andthey cause clinically significant distress or impairmentin social, occupational, or other important areas offunctioning. The depressed mood is associated with intoxication orwithdrawal from substances such as alco- hol, amphetamines, cocaine, hallucinogens, opioids,phencyclidine-like substances, sedatives, hypnotics, oranxiolytics. The symptoms meet the full criteria for arelevant depressive disorder (APA, 2013). A number of medications have been known to evoke mood symptoms. Classifications include anesthetics,analgesics, anticholinergics, anticonvulsants, antihyper-tensives, antiparkinsonian psychotropicmedications, muscle relaxants, steroids, and sulfon-amides. Some specific examples are included in the dis-cussion of predisposing factors to depressive disorders.

Typesof physiological influences are included in the discus-sion on predisposing factors to depression. Predisposing Factors The etiology of depression is unclear. No single theoryor hypothesis has been postulated that substantiates aclear-cut explanation for the disease. Evidence contin-ues to mount in support of multiple causations, recog-nizing the combined effects of genetic, biochemical,and psychosocial influences on an individual's suscep-tibility to depression. A number of theoretical postu-lates are presented here. Biological Theories Genetics Affective illness has been the subject of considerableresearch on the relevance of hereditary factors. A ge-netic link has been suggested in numerous studies;however, a definitive mode of genetic transmissionhas yet to be demonstrated. Twin Studies Twin studies suggest a strong genetic factor in the etiology of affective illness. Joska and Stein (2008) re-ported that studies of monozygotic twins indicate thatheritability of recurrent major depression is approxi-mately 37 percent. They stated: In individuals who share all or almost all of their ge- netic material, genes account for about 37 percentof the risk of developing major depression. The effect of the individual environment and the inter-action between genes and the said environmentprobably account for a large portion of the remain-ing risk. (p. 474) Family Studies Most family studies have shown that major depression is more common among first-degree biological relativesof people with the disorder than among the generalpopulation (Black & Andreasen, 2011). Indeed, the ev-idence to support an increased risk of depressive disor-der in individuals with positive family history is quitecompelling. It is unlikely that random environmentalfactors could cause the concentration of illness that isseen within families. Adoption Studies Further support for heritability as an etiological influ-ence in depression comes from studies of the adoptedoffspring of affectively ill biological parents. Thesestudies have indicated that biological children of par-ents with mood disorders are at increased risk of de-veloping a mood disorder, even when they are rearedby adoptive parents who do not have the disorder(Puri & Treasaden, 2011). Biochemical Influences Biogenic Amines It has been hypothesized that depressive illness may berelated to a deficiency of the neurotransmitters norepi-nepherine, serotonin, and dopamine, at functionally important receptor sites in the brain. Historically, thebiogenic amine hypothesis of mood disorders grew outof the observation that reserpine, which depletes thebrain of amines, was associated with the development ofa depressive syndrome (Slattery, Hudson, & Nutt, 2004).The catecholamine norepinephrine has been identifiedas a key component in the mobilization of the body todeal with stressful situations. Neurons that contain sero-tonin are critically involved in the regulation of manypsychobiological functions, such as mood, anxiety,arousal, vigilance, irritability, thinking, cognition, aggression, and 2003). Tryptophan, the amino acidprecursor of serotonin, has been shown to enhancethe efficacy of antidepressant medications and, onoccasion, to be effective as an antidepressant itself.The level of dopamine in the mesolimbic system ofthe brain is thought to exert a strong influence overhuman mood and behavior. A diminished supply ofthese biogenic amines inhibits the transmission ofimpulses from one neuronal fiber to another, causinga failure of the cells to fire or become charged (seeFigure 25-1). More recently, the biogenic amine hypothesis has been expanded to include another neurotransmitter,acetylcholine. Because cholinergic agents do haveprofound effects on mood, electroencephalograms,sleep, and neuroendocrine function, it has been sug-gested that the problem in depression and mania maybe an imbalance between the biogenic amines andacetylcholine. Cholinergic transmission is thought tobe excessive in depression and inadequate in mania(Dubovsky et al., 2003). The precise role that any of the neurotransmitters plays in the etiology of depression is unknown. As thebody of research grows, there is no doubt that in-creased knowledge regarding the biogenic amineswill contribute to a greater capacity for understandingand treating affective illness. Neuroendocrine Disturbances Neuroendocrine disturbances may play a role in thepathogenesis or persistence of depressive illness. Thisnotion has arisen in view of the marked disturbancesin mood observed with the administration of certainhormones or in the presence of spontaneously occur-ring endocrine disease.464 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch25_458-497 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 464CHAPTER 25 Depressive Disorders 465 NEUROTRANSMITTERS Although other neurotransmitters have also been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression, disturbances in serotonin and norepinephrine have been the most extensively scrutinized. Cell bodies of origin for the serotonin pathways lie within the raphe nuclei located in the brainstem. Those for norepinepherin e originate in the locus ceruleus. Projections for extend throughout the forebrain, prefrontal cortex, cerebellum,and limbic system. AREAS OF THE BRAIN AFFECTED Areas of the brain affected by depression and the symptoms that they mediate include the following:\u0081 Hippocampus: Memory impairments, feelings of Anhedonia, anxiety, reduced motivation\u0081 Hypothalamus: Increased or decreased and appetite; decreased energy and libido\u0081 Other limbic Psychomotor retardation/agitation MEDICATIONS AND THEIR EFFECTS IN THE BRAIN All medications that increase serotonin, norepinephrine, or both can improve the emotional and vegetative symptoms of depressio n. Medications that produce these effects include those that block the presynaptic reuptake of the neurotransmitters or block rece ptors at (tricyclics; and those that inhibit monoamine oxidase, an enzyme that is involved in the metabolism of the monoamines serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine (MAOIs). Side effects of these medications relate to their specific neurotransmitter receptor-blocking action. Tricyclic and tetracyclic drugs and duloxetine, block serotonin andnorepinephrine reuptake and also are weak inhibitors of dopamine. Blockade of norepinephrine reuptake results in side effects of tremors, cardiac arrhythmias, sexual dysfunction, and hypertensi on. Blockade of serotonin reuptake results in side effects of GI disturbances, increased agitation, and sexual dysfunction. Blockad e of dopamine reuptake results in side effects of psychomotor activation. Blockade of acetylcholine reuptake results in dry mouth, b lurred vision, constipation, and urinary retention. Blockade of histamine reuptake PM Page 465Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenocortical Axis In clients who are depressed, the normal system of hormonal inhibition fails, resulting in a hypersecre-tion of cortisol. This elevated serum cortisol is thebasis for the dexamethasone suppression test that is sometimes used to determine if an individual hassomatically treatable depression. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Thyroid Axis Thyrotropin-releasing factor administered TRF is observed in ap-proximately 25 percent of depressed persons. Thislaboratory test has potential for identifying clients athigh risk for affective illness. Physiological Influences Depressive symptoms that occur as a consequence ofa non-mood disorder or as an adverse effect of certainmedications are called a secondary depression. Second- ary depression may be related to medication side ef-fects, neurological disorders, electrolyte or hormonaldisturbances, nutritional deficiencies, and other phys-iological or psychological conditions. Medication Side Effects A number of drugs, either alone or in combinationwith other medications, can produce a depressive syn-drome. Most common among these drugs are thosethat have a direct effect on the central nervous system.Examples of these include the anxiolytics, antipsy-chotics, and sedative-hypnotics. Certain antihyperten-sive medications, such as propranolol and reserpine,have been known to produce depressive symptoms.One research study has found a statistically significantassociation between the acne medication isotretinoin(Accutane), and depression (Azoulay, Blais, Koren,LeLorier, & Berard, 2008). Depressed mood may alsooccur with any of the following medications, althoughthe list is by no means cimetidine An individual who has suffered a cardiovascular acci-dent (CVA) may experience a despondency unrelatedto the severity of the CVA. These are true mood dis-orders, and antidepressant drug therapy may be indi-cated. Brain tumors, particularly in the area of thetemporal lobe, often cause symptoms of depression.Agitated depression may be part of the clinical pic-ture associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson'sdisease, and Huntington's disease. Agitation and rest-lessness may also represent an underlying depressionin the individual with multiple sclerosis. Electrolyte Disturbances Excessive levels of sodium bicarbonate or calcium canproduce symptoms of depression, as can deficits inmagnesium and sodium. Potassium is also implicatedin the syndrome of depression. Symptoms have beenobserved with excesses of potassium in the body, aswell as in instances of potassium depletion. Hormonal Disturbances Depression is associated with dysfunction of the adrenalcortex and is commonly observed in both Addison's dis-ease and Cushing's syndrome. Other endocrine condi-tions that may result in symptoms of depression includehypoparathyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, hypothy-roidism, and hyperthyroidism. An imbalance of the hormones estrogen and prog- esterone has been implicated in dysphoric It is postulated thatexcess estrogen or a high estrogen-to-progesteroneratio during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle isresponsible for the symptoms associated with the disorder, although the exact etiology is unknown(Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Nutritional Deficiencies Deficiencies in vitamin B1(thiamine), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B12, niacin, vitamin C, iron, folic acid, zinc, calcium, and potassium may producesymptoms of depression (Schimelpfening, 2012). A number of nutritional alterations have also been indicated in the etiology of premenstrual dysphoric dis-order. They include deficiencies in the vitamins, magnesium, manganese, vitamin E, and linolenicacid (Frackiewicz & Glucose tolerancefluctuations, abnormal fatty acid metabolism, and sen-sitivity to caffeine and alcohol may also play a role inbringing about the symptoms associated with this disor-der. No definitive evidence exists to support any specificnutritional alteration in the etiology of these symptoms. Other Physiological Conditions Other conditions that have been associated with sec-ondary depression include collagen disorders, such assystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and polyarteritisnodosa; cardiovascular disease, such as heart failure, and myocardial infarction; in-fections, such as encephalitis, hepatitis, mononucleosis,466 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch25_458-497 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 466pneumonia, and as diabetes mellitus and porphyria. Psychosocial Theories Psychoanalytical Theory Freud (1957) presented his classic paper \"Mourningand Melancholia\" in 1917. He defined the distin-guishing features as: . . . a profoundly painful dejection, cessation of inter- est in the outside world, loss of the capacity to love,inhibition of all activity, and a lowering of the self-regarding feelings to a degree that finds utterancesin self-reproaches and self-revilings, and culminatesin a delusional expectation of punishment. He observed that melancholia occurs after the loss of a loved object, either actually by death or emotion- ally by rejection, or the loss of some other abstractionof value to the individual. Freud indicated that inmelancholia, the depressed patient's rage is internallydirected because of identification with the lost object(Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Freud believed that the individual predisposed to melancholia experienced ambivalence in love rela-tionships. He postulated, therefore, that once the losshad been incorporated into the self (ego), the hostilepart of the ambivalence that had been felt for the lostobject is then turned inward against the ego. Learning Theory The model of \"learned helplessness\" arises out of Selig-man's (1973) experiments with dogs. The animals wereexposed to electrical stimulation from which they couldnot escape. Later, when they were given the opportunityto avoid the traumatic experience, they reacted withhelplessness and made no attempt to escape. A similarstate of helplessness exists in humans who have experi-enced numerous failures (either real or perceived).The individual abandons any further attempt to suc-ceed. Seligman theorized that learned helplessness predisposes individuals to depression by imposing afeeling of lack of control over their life situation. Theybecome depressed because they feel helpless; they havelearned that whatever they do is futile. This can be es-pecially damaging very early in life, because the senseof mastery over one's environment is an importantfoundation for future emotional development. Object Loss Theory The theory of object loss suggests that depressive illnessoccurs as a result of having been abandoned by or oth-erwise separated from a significant other during the first6 months of life. Because during this period the motherrepresents the child's main source of security, she is con-sidered to be the \"object.\" This absence of attachment,which may be either physical or emotional, leads to feelings of helplessness and despair that contribute tolifelong patterns of depression in response to loss. The concept of \"anaclitic depression\" was intro- duced in 1946 by psychiatrist Ren\u00e9 Spitz to refer tochildren who became depressed after being separatedfrom their mothers for an extended period of timeduring the first year of life (Cartwright, 2004). Thecondition included behaviors such as excessive crying,anorexia, withdrawal, psychomotor retardation , stu- por, and a generalized impairment in the normalprocess of growth and development. Some researcherssuggest that loss in adult life afflicts people much moreseverely in the form of depression if the subjects havesuffered early childhood loss. Cognitive Theory Beck and colleagues (1979) proposed a theory sug-gesting that the primary disturbance in depression iscognitive rather than affective. The underlying causeof the depressive affect is seen as cognitive distortionsthat result in negative, defeated attitudes. Beck andcolleagues identified three cognitive distortions thatthey believe serve as the basis for depression: 1.Negative expectations of the environment. 2.Negative expectations of the self. 3.Negative expectations of the future. These cognitive distortions arise out of a defect in cognitive development, and the individual feels inad-equate, worthless, and rejected by others. Outlook forthe future is one of pessimism and hopelessness. Cognitive theorists believe that depression is the prod- uct of negative thinking. This is in contrast to the othertheorists, who suggest that negative thinking occurs whenan individual is depressed. Cognitive t herapy focuses on helping the individual to alter mood by changing the wayhe or she thinks. The individual is taught to control neg-ative thought distortions that lead to pessimism, lethargy,procrastination, and low self-esteem (see Chapter 19). The Transactional Model As is clearly evident, no single theory or hypothesisexists to substantiate a clear-cut explanation for de-pressive disorder. Evidence continues to mount insupport of multiple causation. The transactionalmodel recognizes the combined effects of genetic,biochemical, and psychosocial influences on an indi-vidual's susceptibility to depression. The dynamics ofdepression using the Transactional Model of Stress/Adaptation are presented in Figure 25-2.

It is not uncom-mon, however, for the symptoms of depression to bemanifested differently in childhood, and the picturechanges with age (Dopheide, 2006; Joska & Stein,2008; Tempfer, 2006): 1. Up to age 3: Signs may include feeding problems, tantrums, lack of playfulness and emotional ex-pressiveness, failure to thrive, or delays in speechand gross motor development. 2. From ages 3 to 5: Common symptoms may include accident proneness, phobias, aggressiveness, andexcessive self-reproach for minor infractions. 3. From ages 6 to 8: There may be vague physical complaints and aggressive behavior. They may cling to parents and avoid new people and chal-lenges. They may lag behind their classmates in social skills and academic competence. 4. From ages 9 to 12: Common symptoms include morbid thoughts and excessive worrying. They may reason that they are depressed because they havedisappointed their parents in some way . There may be lack of interest in playing with friends.Other symptoms of childhood depression may in- clude hyperactivity, delinquency, school problems,psychosomatic complaints, sleeping and eating distur-bances, social isolation, delusional thinking, and suicidal thoughts or actions. The APA (2013) has in-cluded a new diagnostic category in the DepressiveDisorders chapter of the DSM-5. This childhood dis- order is called disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The diagnostic criteria for disruptive mood dysregu-lation disorder are presented in Box 25-4. Children may become depressed for various rea- sons. In many depressed children, there is a geneticpredisposition toward the condition, which is thenprecipitated by a stressful situation. Common precip-itating factors include physical or emotional detach-ment by the primary caregiver, parental separation ordivorce, death of a loved one (person or pet), a move,academic failure, or physical illness. In any event, thecommon denominator is loss. The focus of therapy with depressed children is to alleviate the child's symptoms and strengthen thechild's coping and adaptive skills, with the hope of pos-sibly preventing future psychological problems. Somestudies have shown that untreated childhood depres-sion may lead to subsequent problems in adolescenceCHAPTER 25 Depressive Disorders 469 BOX 25-4 Diagnostic Criteria for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder A. Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally (e.g., verbal rages) and/or behaviorally (e.g., physical ag- gression toward people or property) that are grossly outof proportion in intensity or duration to the situation orprovocation. B. The temper outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level. C. The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per week. D. The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irrita- ble or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers). E. Criteria A-D have been present for 12 or more months. Throughout that time, the individual has not had a periodlasting 3 or more consecutive months without all of thesymptoms of Criteria A-D. F. Criteria A and D are present in at least two of three set- tings (i.e., at home, at school, with peers) and are severein at least one of these. G. The diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age 6 or after age 18 years. H. By history or observation, the age at onset of Criteria A-E is before 10 years. I. There has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day during which the full symptom criteria, except duration, for a manic or hypomanic episode have beenmet. Note: Developmentally appropriate mood elevation, such as occurs in the context of a highly positive event orits anticipation, should not be considered as a symptomof mania or hypomania. J. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of major depressive disorder and are not better explainedby another mental disorder (e.g., autism spectrum disor-der, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety dis-order, persistent depressive disorder [dysthymia]). Note: This diagnosis cannot coexist with oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, or bipolardisorder, though it can coexist with others, including majordepressive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disor-der, conduct disorder, and substance use disorders. Indi-viduals whose symptoms meet criteria for both disruptivemood dysregulation di sorder and oppositional defiant dis- order should only be given the diagnosis of disruptivemood dysregulation disorder. If an individual has ever experienced a manic or hypomanic episode, the diagnosisof disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not beassigned. K. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological ef- fects of a substance or to another medical or neurologicalcondition.

Hospitalization of the depressed child usu-ally occurs only if he or she is actively suicidal, whenthe home environment precludes adherence to a treat-ment regimen, or if the child needs to be separatedfrom the home because of psychosocial deprivation. Parental and family therapy are commonly used to help the younger depressed child. Recovery is facilitated by emotional support and guidance to fam-ily members. Children older than age 8 years usuallyparticipate in family therapy. In some situations, indi-vidual treatment may be appropriate for older chil-dren. Medications, such as antidepressants, can beimportant in the treatment of children, especially forthe more serious and recurrent forms of depression.The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)have been used with success, particularly in combina-tion with psychosocial therapies. However, becausethere has been some concern that the use of antide-pressant medications may cause suicidal behavior inyoung people, the U.S. Food and Drug Administra-tion (FDA) has applied a \"black box\" label warning(described in the next section) to all antidepressantmedications. The National Institute of Mental Health(2013) stated: Those who are prescribed an [antidepressant] medica- tion should receive ongoing medical monitoring. Chil-dren already taking an [antidepressant] should remainon the medication if it has been helpful, but should becarefully monitored by a doctor for side effects. Parentsshould promptly seek medical advice and evaluation iftheir child or adolescent experiences suicidal thinkingor behavior, nervousness, agitation, irritability, mood in-stability, or sleeplessness that either emerges or worsensduring treatment with [antidepressant] medications. Adolescence Depression may be even harder to recognize in an ado- lescent than in a younger child. Feelings of sadness,loneliness, anxiety, and hopelessness associated with de-pression may be perceived as the normal emotionalstresses of growing up. Therefore, many young peoplewhose symptoms are attributed to the \"normal adjust-ments\" of adolescence do not get the help they need.Depression is a major cause of suicide among teens, andsuicide is the second leading cause of death in the 15- to24-year-old age group (National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS], 2012). The World Health Organization(WHO) recently reported that depression is the maincause of illness and disability in adolescents worldwide(WHO, 2014). Common symptoms of depression in the adolescent are inappropriately expressed anger, aggressiveness,running away, delinquency, social withdrawal, sexualacting out, substance abuse, restlessness, and apathy.Loss of self-esteem, sleeping and eating disturbances,and psychosomatic complaints are also common. What, then, is the indicator that differentiates mood disorder from the typical stormy behavior ofadolescence? A visible manifestation of behavioral change that lasts for several weeks is the best clue for a mood disorder. Examples include the normally outgoing andextroverted adolescent who has become withdrawn andantisocial, the good student who previously receivedconsistently high marks but is now failing and skippingclasses, and the usually self-confident teenager who isnow inappropriately irritable and defensive with others. Adolescents become depressed for all the same rea- sons that were discussed under childhood depression.In adolescence, however, depression is a commonmanifestation of the stress and independence conflictsassociated with the normal maturation process. De-pression may also be the response to death of a parent,other relative, or friend, or to a breakup with aboyfriend or girlfriend. This perception of abandon-ment by parents or closest peer relationship is thoughtto be the most frequent immediate precipitant to ado-lescent suicide. Treatment of the depressed adolescent is often conducted on an outpatient basis. Hospitalization maybe required in cases of severe depression or threat ofimminent suicide, when a family situation is such thattreatment cannot be carried out in the home, whenthe physical condition precludes self-care of biologicalneeds, or when the adolescent has indicated possibleharm to self or others in the family. In addition to supportive psychosocial intervention, antidepressant therapy may be part of the treatmentof adolescent mood disorders. However, as mentionedpreviously, the FDA has issued a public health advisorywarning the public about the increased risk of suicidalthoughts and behavior in children and adolescentsbeing treated with antidepressant medications. Theblack box warning label on all antidepressant medica-tions describes this risk and emphasizes the need forclose monitoring of clients started on these medica-tions. The advisory language does not prohibit the useof antidepressants in children and adolescents. Rather,it warns of the risk of suicidality and encourages pre-scribers to balance this risk with clinical need. Fluoxetine (Prozac) has been approved by the FDA to treat depression in children and adolescents, and escitalo-pram (Lexipro) was approved in 2009 for treatment ofMDD in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. The other SSRImedications, such as sertraline, citalopram, desvenlafaxine have not been approved fortreatment of depression in children or adolescents, although they have been prescribed to children by physicians in \"off-label use\"\u2014a use other than the 470 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch25_458-497 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 470FDA-approved use. In June 2003, the FDA recommended that paroxetine not be used in children and adolescentsfor the treatment of major depressive disorder. Senescence Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder ofthe elderly, who make up 13.3 percent of the generalpopulation of the United States (Administration onAging, 2013). This is not surprising considering the dis-proportionate value our society places on youth, vigor,and uninterrupted productivity. These societal attitudescontinually nurture the feelings of low self-esteem, help-lessness, and hopelessness that become more pervasiveand intensive with advanced age. Further, the aging in-dividual's adaptive coping strategies may be seriouslychallenged by major stressors, such as financial prob-lems, physical illness, changes in bodily functioning,and an increasing awareness of approaching death. Theproblem is often intensified by the numerous losses in-dividuals experience during this period in life, such asspouse, friends, children, home, and independence. Aphenomenon called bereavement overload occurs when individuals experience so many losses in their lives thatthey are not able to resolve one grief response beforeanother one begins. Bereavement overload predisposeselderly individuals to depressive illness. Although they make up only slightly more than 13 percent of the population, the elderly account forapproximately 16 percent of the suicides in theUnited States (NCHS, 2013). The highest number ofsuicides is among white men 85 years of age andolder, at almost 4 times the national rate. Symptoms of depression in the elderly are not very different from those in younger adults. However, de-pressive syndromes are often confused with other ill-nesses associated with the aging process. Symptoms ofdepression are often misdiagnosed as neurocognitivedisorder (NCD), when in fact the memory loss, con-fused thinking, or apathy symptomatic of NCD actu-ally may be the result of depression. The earlyawakening and reduced appetite typical of depressionare common among many older people who are notdepressed. Compounding this situation is the fact thatmany medical conditions, such as endocrinological,neurological, nutritional, and metabolic disorders,often present with classic symptoms of depression.Many medications commonly used by the elderly, suchas antihypertensives, corticosteroids, and analgesics,can also produce a depressant effect. Depression does accompany many of the illnesses that afflict older people, such as Parkinson's disease,cancer, arthritis, and the early stages of Alzheimer'sdisease. Treating depression in these situations canreduce unnecessary suffering and help afflicted indi-viduals cope with their medical problems.The most effective treatment of depression in the elderly individual is thought to be a combination of psychosocial and biological approaches. Antidepressantmedications are administered with consideration for age-related physiological changes in absorption, distribution, elimination, and brain receptor sensitivity.Because of these changes, plasma concentrations ofthese medications can reach very high levels despitemoderate oral doses. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains one of the safest and most effective treatments for major de-pression in the elderly. The response to ECT appearsto be slower with advancing age, and the therapeuticeffects are of limited duration. However, it may beconsidered the treatment of choice for the elderly in-dividual who is an acute suicidal risk or is unable totolerate antidepressant medications. Other therapeutic approaches include interpersonal, behavioral, cognitive, group, and family psychothera-pies. Appropriate treatment of the depressed elderly in-dividual can bring relief from suffering and offer a newlease on life with a feeling of renewed productivity. Postpartum Depression The severity of depression in the postpartum periodvaries from a feeling of the \"blues,\" to moderate depres-sion, to psychotic depression or melancholia. Of womenwho give birth, approximately 50 to 85 percent experi-ence the \"blues\" following delivery (Mehta & Sheth,2006). The incidence of moderate depression is 10 to20 percent. Severe, or psychotic, depression occursrarely, in about 1 or 2 out of 1000 postpartum women. Symptoms of the \"maternity blues\" include tearful- ness, despondency, anxiety, and subjectively impairedconcentration appearing in the early puerperium.The symptoms usually begin within 48 hours of deliv-ery, peak at about 3 to 5 days, and last approximately2 weeks (Mehta & Sheth, 2006). Symptoms of moderate postpartum depression have been described as depressed mood varying fromday to day, with more bad days than good, tending tobe worse toward evening and associated with fatigue,irritability, loss of appetite, sleep disturbances, andloss of libido. In addition, the new mother expressesa great deal of concern about her inability to care forher baby. These symptoms begin somewhat later thanthose described in the \"maternity blues,\" and takefrom a few weeks to several months to abate. Postpartum melancholia, or depressive psychosis, is characterized by depressed mood, agitation, indecision,lack of concentration, guilt, and an abnormal attitudetoward bodily functions. There may be lack of interestin, or rejection of, the baby, or a morbid fear that thebaby may be harmed. Risks of suicide and infanticideshould not be overlooked. These symptoms usually CHAPTER 25 Depressive Disorders 4714092_Ch25_458-497 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 471develop during the first few days following birth, but may occur later (Mehta & Sheth, 2006). The etiology of postpartum depression remains unclear. \"Maternity blues\" may be associated with hor-monal changes, tryptophan metabolism, or alterationsin membrane transport during the early postpartum pe-riod. Besides being exposed to these same somaticchanges, the woman who experiences moderate to severe symptoms probably possesses a vulnerability todepression related to heredity, upbringing, early life ex-periences, personality, or social circumstances. A historyof depression appears to be a risk factor for postpartumdepression (Sword, Clark, Hegadoren, Brooks, &Kingston, 2012). The etiology of postpartum depressionmay very likely be a combination of hormonal, meta-bolic, and psychosocial influences. Treatment of postpartum depression varies with the severity of the illness. Psychotic depression may betreated with antidepressant medication, along withsupportive psychotherapy, group therapy, and possiblyfamily therapy. Moderate depression may be relievedwith supportive psychotherapy and continuing assis-tance with home management until the symptomssubside. \"Maternity blues\" usually needs no treatmentbeyond a word of reassurance from the physician ornurse that these feelings are common and will soonpass. Extra support and comfort from significant others also is important. Application of the Nursing Process Background Assessment Data Symptomatology of depression can be viewed on a con-tinuum according to severity of the illness. All individ-uals become depressed from time to time. These arethe transient symptoms that accompany the everydaydisappointments of life. Examples of the disappoint-ments include failing an examination or breaking upwith a boyfriend or girlfriend. Transient symptoms ofdepression subside relatively quickly as the individualadvances toward other goals and achievements. Mild depressive episodes occur when the grief process is triggered in response to the loss of a valuedobject. This can occur with the loss of a loved one, pet,friend, home, or significant other. As one is able towork through the stages of grief, the loss is accepted,symptoms subside, and activities of daily living are re-sumed within a few weeks. If this does not occur, griefis prolonged or exaggerated, and symptoms intensify. Moderate depression occurs when grief is prolonged or exaggerated. The individual becomes fixed in theanger stage of the grief response, and the anger isturned inward on the self. All of the feelings associatedwith normal grieving are exaggerated out of proportion,and the individual is unable to function without assis-tance. Dysthymia is an example of moderate depression. Severe depression is an intensification of the symp- toms associated with the moderate level. The individualwho is severely depressed may also demonstrate a lossof contact with reality. This level is associated with acomplete lack of pleasure in all activities, and rumina-tions about suicide are common. Major depressive dis-order is an example of severe depression. A continuumof depression is presented in Figure 25-3. A number of assessment rating scales are available for measuring severity of depressive symptoms. Someare meant to be clinician administered, whereas oth-ers may be self-administered. Examples of self-ratingscales include the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scaleand the Beck Depression Inventory. One of the mostwidely used clinician-administered scales is the Hamil-ton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). It has been re-viewed and revised over the years, and exists today inseveral versions. The original version (see Box 25-5)contains 17 items and is designed to measure mood,guilty feelings, suicidal ideation, sleep disturbances,anxiety levels, and weight loss. Symptoms of depression can be described as alterations in four spheres of human functioning: (1) affective, (2) behavioral, (3) cognitive, and (4) phys-iological. Alterations within these spheres differ according to degree of severity of symptomatology. Transient Depression Symptoms at this level of the continuum are not neces-sarily dysfunctional. Alterations include the following: Affective: sadness, dejection, feeling downhearted, having the \"blues.\"472 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation Transient DepressionMild DepressionModerate DepressionSevere Depression Life's of depression.4092_Ch25_458-497 24/07/14 5:28 PM Page 472CHAPTER 25 Depressive Disorders 473 BOX 25-5 Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) Instructions: For each item, circle the number to select the one \"cue\" that best characterizes the patient. 1.

Cognitive: some difficulty getting mind off of one's disappointment. Physiological: feeling tired and listless. Mild Depression Symptoms at the mild level of depression are identi- fied by those associated with uncomplicated grieving.Alterations at the mild level include the following: Affective: denial of feelings, anger, anxiety, guilt, helplessness, hopelessness, sadness, despondency. Behavioral: tearfulness, regression, restlessness, agitation, withdrawal. Cognitive: preoccupation with the loss, self-blame, ambivalence, blaming others. Physiological: anorexia or overeating, insomnia or hypersomnia, headache, backache, chest pain,or other symptoms associated with the loss of a significant other. Moderate Depression Dysthymia, which is an example of moderate depres-sion, represents a more problematic disturbance. Symp-toms associated with this disorder include the following: Affective: feelings of sadness, dejection, helplessness, powerlessness, hopelessness; pessimisticoutlook; low self-esteem; difficulty regrets; socialisolation the self; increased use ofsubstances possible; self-destructive behavior possi-ble; decreased interest in personal hygiene andgrooming. Cognitive: slowed thinking processes; difficulty concentrating and directing attention; obsessiveand repetitive thoughts, generally pes-simism and suicidal level; fatigue and list-lessness; feeling best early in the morning and con-tinually worse as the day progresses. This may berelated to the diurnal variation in the level of neu-rotransmitters that affect mood and level of activity. Severe Depression Severe depression is characterized by an intensifica-tion of the symptoms described for moderate de-pression. Examples of severe depression includemajor depressive disorder and bipolar depression.Symptoms at the severe level of depression includethe following: Affective: feelings of total despair, hopelessness, and worthlessness; flat (unchanging) affect, appear-ing devoid of emotional tone; prevalent to feel pleasure. Behavioral: psychomotor retardation so severe that physical movement may literally come to a stand-still, or psychomotor behavior manifested by rapid,agitated, purposeless communication(when verbalizations they may reflectdelusional thinking); no personal hygiene andgrooming; social isolation is common, with virtuallyno inclination toward interaction with others. Cognitive: prevalent delusional thinking, with delu- sions of persecution and somatic delusions beingmost common; confusion, indecisiveness, and an inability to concentrate; hallucinations reflecting mis-interpretations of the environment; excessive self-deprecation, self-blame, and thoughts of suicide. NOTE: Because of the low energy level and slow thought processes, the individual may be unable to follow through on suicidal ideas. However, the desire is strong at this level.Physiological: a general slowdown of the entire body, reflected in digestion, awakening very early in themorning; feeling worse early in the morning andsomewhat better as the day progresses. As withmoderate depression, this may reflect the diurnalvariation in the level of neurotransmitters that affect mood and activity. Diagnosis/Outcome Identification Using information collected during the assessment,the nurse completes the client database, from whichthe selection of appropriate nursing diagnoses is de-termined. Table 25-1 presents a list of client behaviorsand the NANDA nursing diagnoses that correspondto those behaviors, which may be used in planningcare for the depressed client. Outcome Criteria The following criteria may be used for measurementof outcomes in the care of the depressed client.CHAPTER 25 Depressive Disorders 475 TABLE 25-1 Assigning Nursing Diagnoses to Behaviors Commonly Associated With Depression BEHAVIORS NURSING DIAGNOSES Depressed mood; feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness; anger turned inward on the self; misinterpretations of reality; suicidal ideation, plan, and available means Depression, preoccupation with thoughts of loss, self-blame, grief avoidance, inappropriate expression of anger , decreased functioning in life roles Expressions of helplessness, uselessness, guilt, and shame; hypersensitivity to slight or criticism; negative, pessimistic outlook; lack of eye contact; self-negating verbalizations Apathy, verbal expressions of having no control, dependence on others to fulfill needs Expresses anger toward God, expresses lack of meaning in life, sudden changes in spiritual practices, refuses interactions with significant others or with spiritual leaders Withdrawn, uncommunicative, seeks to be alone, dysfunctional interaction with others, discomfort in social situations Inappropriate thinking, confusion, difficulty concentrating, impaired problem- solving ability, inaccurate interpretation of environment, memory deficit Weight loss, poor muscle tone, pale conjunctiva and mucous membranes, poor skin turgor, weakness Difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, verbal reports of not feeling well rested Uncombed hair, disheveled clothing, offensive body odor *This diagnosis has been retired from the NANDA-I list of approved diagnoses. It is used in this instance because it is most co mpatible with the identified behaviors.Risk for suicide Complicated grieving Low self-esteem Powerlessness Spiritual distress Social isolation/Impaired social interaction Disturbed thought processes* Imbalanced nutrition: Less than body requirements 24/07/14 5:29 PM Page 475The client: Has experienced no physical harm to self. Discusses the loss with staff and family members. No longer idealizes or obsesses about the lost entity/concept. Sets realistic goals for self. Is no longer afraid to attempt new activities. Is able to identify aspects of self-control over life situation. Expresses personal satisfaction and support fromspiritual practices. Interacts willingly and appropriately with others. Is able to maintain reality orientation. Is able to concentrate, reason, and solve problems. Eats a well-balanced diet with snacks, to preventweight loss and maintain nutritional status. Sleeps 6 to 8 hours per night and reports feelingwell rested. Bathes, washes and combs hair, and dresses inclean clothing without assistance. Planning/Implementation The following section presents a group of selectednursing diagnoses, with short- and long-term goalsand nursing interventions for each. Some institutions are using a case management model to coordinate care (see Chapter 9 for more de-tailed explanation). In case management models, theplan of care may take the form of a critical pathway. Risk for Suicide Risk for suicide is defined as \"at risk for self-inflicted, life- threatening injury\" (NANDA-International [NANDA-I],2012, p. 452). For additional interventions and to view this nursing diagnosis in care plan format, seeChapter 17. Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goals Client will seek out staff when feeling urge to harmself. Client will make short-term verbal (or written) con-tract with nurse not to harm self. Client will not harm self. Long-Term Goal Client will not harm self. Interventions Create a safe environment for the client. Remove allpotentially harmful objects from client's access (sharpobjects, straps, belts, ties, glass items, alcohol). Super-vise closely during meals and medication administra-tion. Perform room searches as deemed necessary.476 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation CLINICAL PEARL Ask the client directly, \"Have you thought about killing your- self?\" or \"Have you thought about harming yourself in any way?\" \"If so, what do you plan to do? Do you have the means tocarry out this plan?\" The risk of suicide is greatly increased ifthe client has developed a plan and particularly if means exist for the client to execute the plan. Formulate a short-term verbal or written contract with the client that he or she will not harm self dur-ing a specific time period. When that contract expires, make another. Repeat this process for aslong as required. Discussion of suicidal feelingswith a trusted individual provides some relief to theclient. A contract gets the subject out in the openand some of the responsibility for his or her safetyis given to the client. An attitude of unconditionalacceptance of the client as a worthwhile individualis conveyed. Note: Some clinicians believe that sui- cide prevention contracting is not helpful (Knoll,2011). Obviously, the contract for safety comes withno guarantee, and it holds no legal credibility. Itshould never be used as a single intervention, butcan be viewed as one among many that serve to ensure the client's safety. Secure a promise from the client that he or she will seek out a staff member or support person ifthoughts of suicide emerge. Suicidal clients areoften very ambivalent about their feelings. Discus-sion of feelings with a trusted individual may pro-vide assistance before the client experiences a crisissituation. CLINICAL PEARL Be direct. Talk openly and matter-of-factly about suicide. Listen actively and encourage expression of feel-ings, including anger. Accept the client's feelings in a nonjudg- mental manner. Maintain close observation of the client. Depend- ing on level of suicide precaution, provide one-to-one contact, constant visual observation, orevery-15-minute checks. Place in room close tothe nurse's station; do not assign to a privateroom. Accompany to off-ward activities if atten-dance is indicated. May need to accompany tobathroom. Close observation is necessary to en-sure that client does not harm self in any way.Being alert for suicidal and escape attempts facil-itates being able to prevent or interrupt harmfulbehavior. Maintain special care in administration of med-ications. This prevents saving up to overdose ordiscarding and not taking. Make rounds at frequent, irregular intervals (espe- cially at night, toward early morning, at change of 4092_Ch25_458-497 24/07/14 5:29 PM Page 476shift, or other predictably busy times for staff). This prevents staff surveillance from becoming pre-dictable. To be aware of client's location is impor-tant, especially when staff is busy, unavailable, orless observable. Encourage verbalizations of honest feelings.Through exploration and discussion, help theclient to identify symbols of hope in his or her life. Encourage the client to express angry feelings withinappropriate limits. Provide a safe method of hostilityrelease. Help the client to identify the true source ofanger and to work on adaptive coping skills for useoutside the treatment setting. Depression and suici-dal behaviors may be viewed as anger turned inwardon the self. If this anger can be verbalized in a non-threatening environment, the client may be able toeventually resolve these feelings. Identify community resources that the client mayuse as a support system and from whom he or shemay request help if feeling suicidal. Having a con-crete plan for seeking assistance during a crisis maydiscourage or prevent self-destructive behaviors. Orient the client to reality, as required. Point outsensory misperceptions or misinterpretations of theenvironment. Take care not to belittle the client'sfears or indicate disapproval of verbal expressions. Most important, spend time with client. This pro-vides a feeling of safety and security, while also con-veying the message, \"I want to spend time with youbecause I think you are a worthwhile person.\" Complicated Grieving Complicated grieving is defined as \"a disorder that occurs after the death of a significant other [or anyother loss of significance to the individual], in whichthe experience of distress accompanying bereave-ment fails to follow normative expectations and man-ifests in functional impairment\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 365). Table 25-2 presents this nursing diagnosis incare plan format. Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goals Client will express anger about the loss. Client will verbalize behaviors associated with normal grieving.CHAPTER 25 Depressive Disorders 477 Table 25-2 | CARE PLAN FOR THE DEPR ESSED CLIENT NURSING DIAGNOSIS: COMPLICATED GRIEVING RELATED TO: Real or perceived loss, bereavement overloadEV IDENCED BY: Denial of loss, inappropriate expression of anger, idealization of or obsession with lost object, inability to carry out activities of daily living OUTCOME CRITERIA NURSING INTERVENTIONS RATIONALE Short-Term Goals \u0081 Client will express anger about the loss. \u0081 Client will verbalize behaviors associated with normal grieving.

Knowledge of cultural influencesspecific to the client is important before using thistechnique. Assist the client in problem-solving as he or she at-tempts to determine methods for more adaptive cop-ing with the experienced loss. Provide positivefeedback for strategies identified and decisions made. Encourage the client to reach out for spiritual sup-port during this time in whatever form is desirableto him or her. Assess spiritual needs of the client(see Chapter 6) and assist as necessary in the ful-fillment of those needs. Encourage the client to attend a support group ofindividuals who are experiencing life situationssimilar to his or her own. Help the client to locatea group of this type. Low Self-Esteem/Self-Care Deficit Low self-esteem is defined as \"negative self-evaluating/feelings about self or self-capabilities [either long-standing or to a current situation]\"(NANDA-I, 2012, pp. 287-288). Self-care deficit is defined as \"impaired ability to perform or complete [activitiesof daily living (ADLs)] for self\" (NANDA-I, 2012, pp. 250-253). Client Goals Short-Term Goals Client will verbalize attributes he or she likesabout self. Client will participate in ADLs with assistance fromhealth-care provider. Long-Term Goals By time of discharge from treatment, the client willexhibit increased feelings of self-worth as evi-denced by verbal expression of positive aspects ofself, past accomplishments, and future prospects. By time of discharge from treatment, the client willexhibit increased feelings of self-worth by settingrealistic goals and trying to reach them, therebydemonstrating a decrease in fear of failure.By time of discharge from treatment, the client willsatisfactorily accomplish ADLs independently. Interventions Be accepting of the client and spend time with himor her even though pessimism and negativism mayseem objectionable. Focus on strengths and accom-plishments and minimize failures. Promote attendance in therapy groups that offerclient simple methods of accomplishment. Encour-age client to be as independent as possible. Encourage the client to recognize areas of changeand provide assistance toward this effort. Teach assertiveness techniques: the ability to recog-nize the differences among passive, assertive, and aggressive behaviors, and the importance of respect-ing the human rights of others while protectingone's own basic human rights. Self-esteem is en-hanced by the ability to interact with others in an assertive manner. Teach effective communication techniques, suchas the use of \"I\" messages. Emphasize ways to avoidmaking judgmental statements (see Chapter 14). Encourage independence in the performance of ADLs, but intervene when client is unable toperform. CLINICAL PEARL Offer recognition and positive reinforcement for independent accomplishments. (Example: \"Mrs. J., I see you have put on a clean dress and combed your hair.\") Show the client how to perform activities with which he or she is having difficulty. When a clientis depressed, he or she may require simple, con-crete demonstrations of activities that would be performed without difficulty under normalconditions. Keep strict records of food and fluid intake. Offernutritious snacks and fluids between meals. Theclient may be unable to tolerate large amounts offood at mealtimes and may therefore require addi-tional nourishment at other times during the dayto receive adequate nutrition. Before bedtime, provide nursing measures thatpromote sleep, such as back is defined as \"the lived experience of lack of control over a situation, including a perceptionthat one's actions do not significantly affect an out-come\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 370). CHAPTER 25 Depressive Disorders 4794092_Ch25_458-497 24/07/14 5:29 PM Page 479Client Goals Short-Term Goal Client will participate in decision-making regarding own care within 5 days. Long-Term Goal Client will be able to effectively problem-solve waysto take control of his or her life situation by timeof discharge from treatment, thereby decreasingfeelings of powerlessness. Interventions Encourage the client to take as much responsibilityas possible for his or her own self-care practices.Providing the client with choices will increase feel-ings of control. EXAMPLES Include the client in setting the goals of care he or she wishes to achieve. Allow the client to establish own schedule for self-care activities. Provide the client with privacy as need is determined. Provide positive feedback for decisions made. Respect theclient's right to make those decisions independently, andrefrain from attempting to influence him or her towardthose that may seem more logical. Help the client set realistic goals. Unrealistic goals set up the client for failure and reinforce feelingsof powerlessness. Help the client identify areas of his or her life situ-ation that can be controlled. The client's emo-tional condition interferes with his or her ability tosolve problems. Assistance is required to perceivethe benefits and consequences of available alterna-tives accurately. Discuss with the client areas of life that are notwithin his or her ability to control. Encourage ver-balization of feelings related to this inability in aneffort to deal with unresolved issues and acceptwhat cannot be changed. Concept Care Mapping The concept map care plan is an innovative approach toplanning and organizing nursing care (see Chapter 9).It is a diagrammatic teaching and learning strategythat allows visualization of interrelationships betweenmedical diagnoses, nursing diagnoses, assessmentdata, and treatments. An example of a concept mapcare plan for a client with depression is presented inFigure 25-4. Client/Family Education The role of client teacher is important in the psychiatric area, as it is in all areas of nursing. A list of topics for client/family education relevant to depression is presented in Box 25-6. Sampleclient teaching guides may be found online atwww.DavisPlus.com. Evaluation of Care for the Depressed Client In the final step of the nursing process, a reassess- ment is conducted to determine if the nursing actionshave been successful in achieving the objectives ofcare. Evaluation of the nursing actions for the de-pressed client may be facilitated by gathering infor-mation using the following types of questions: Has self-harm to the individual been avoided? Have suicidal ideations subsided? Does the individual know where to seek assistanceoutside the hospital when suicidal thoughts occur? Has the client discussed the recent loss with staffand family members? Is he or she able to verbalize feelings and behaviorsassociated with each stage of the grieving processand recognize own position in the process? Have obsession with and idealization of the lost object subsided? Is anger toward the lost object expressed appropri-ately? Does the client set realistic goals for self? Is he or she able to verbalize positive aspects aboutself, past accomplishments, and future prospects? Can the client identify areas of life situation overwhich he or she has control? Is the client able to participate in usual religiouspractices and feel satisfaction and support fromthem? Is the client seeking out interaction with others inan appropriate manner? Does the client maintain reality orientation with noevidence of delusional thinking? Is he or she able to concentrate and make decisionsconcerning own self-care? Is the client selecting and consuming foods suffi-ciently high in nutrients and calories to maintainweight and nutritional status? Does the client sleep without difficulty and wakefeeling rested? Does the client show pride in appearance by at-tending to personal hygiene and grooming? Have somatic complaints subsided?

She has lost weight and rarely goes out of her house. Today the divorcewas finalized. When Judith's daughter, Cathy, went to her mother's house, she found Judith going through hermedication saying she was going to \"take enough to put me to sleep for good.\" Cathy convinced her mother to go tothe hospital, and Judith was admitted to the psychiatric unit with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder. Judithtells the nurse, \"I'm so angry at my husband, I could just kill him! How could he do this to me? I guess it's my fault.I'm not as pretty as his girlfriend.\" Then she says, \"What's the use of going on? No one would want me now.

Strategy Overview: This assignment is meant to familiarize the student with standardized nursing policies, procedures, standardsof care, and other evidence-based nursing practice guidelines, and to encourage students to observe actualnursing practice on the units to note compliance with, deviations from, or \"work arounds\" by RNs when im-plementing nursing procedures. The following aspects of the assignment can guide students in preparationfor clinical conference discussion, in writing a paper, or in putting together a poster presentation.1.Identify a need to place a client on suicide precautions. 2.Find the current written nursing policy or procedure in place for your institution/unit and answer these questions: a.How easy/difficult was it to find the policy/procedure? b. Did the RNs know where to find the written policy/procedure? c. How was the policy/procedure originally disseminated to the staff? d. Is the policy/procedure evidence-based? (Review the current practice standards from professional organizations and/or oversight and accreditationgroups [e.g.: The Joint Commission, CDC], and/or the research literature.)Treatment Modalities for Depression Individual Psychotherapy Research has documented both the importance of close and satisfactory attachments in the preventionof depression and the role of disrupted attachmentsin the development of depression. With this conceptin mind, interpersonal psychotherapy focuses on theclient's current interpersonal relations. Interpersonalpsychotherapy with the depressed person proceedsthrough the following phases and interventions. Phase I During the first phase, the client is assessed to deter-mine the extent of the illness. Complete informationis then given to the individual regarding the natureof depression, symptom pattern, frequency, clinicalcourse, and alternative treatments. If the level of de-pression is severe, interpersonal psychotherapy hasbeen shown to be more effective if conducted in com-bination with antidepressant medication. The clientis encouraged to continue working and participatingin regular activities during therapy. A mutually agree-able therapeutic contract is negotiated.4092_Ch25_458-497 24/07/14 5:29 PM Page 482Phase II Treatment at this phase focuses on helping the client resolve complicated grief reactions. This may include resolving the ambivalence with a lost relationship, serv-ing as a temporary substitute for the lost relationship,and assistance with establishing new relationships. Otherareas of treatment focus may include interpersonal dis-putes between the client and a significant other, difficultrole transitions at various developmental life cycles, andcorrection of interpersonal deficits that may interferewith the client's ability to initiate or sustain interpersonalrelationships. Phase III During the final phase of interpersonal psychotherapy,the therapeutic alliance is terminated. With emphasison reassurance, clarification of emotional states, im-provement of interpersonal communication, testingof perceptions, and performance in interpersonal set-tings, interpersonal psychotherapy has been successfulin helping depressed persons recover enhanced socialfunctioning. Group Therapy Group therapy forms an important dimension of mul-timodal treatment for the depressed client. Once anacute phase of the illness is passed, groups can pro-vide an atmosphere in which individuals may discussissues in their lives that cause, maintain, or arise outof having a serious affective disorder. The element ofpeer support provides a feeling of security, as trouble-some or embarrassing issues are discussed and re-solved. Some groups have other specific purposes,such as helping to monitor medication-related issuesor serving as an avenue for promoting education re-lated to the affective disorder and its treatment. Ther-apy groups help members gain a sense of perspectiveon their condition and tangibly encourage them tolink up with others who have common problems. Asense of hope is conveyed when the individual is ableto see that he or she is not alone or unique in experi-encing affective illness. Self-help groups offer another avenue of support for the depressed client. These groups are usually peerled and are not meant to substitute for, or competewith, professional therapy. They offer supplementarysupport that frequently enhances compliance with themedical regimen. Examples of self-help groups are theDepression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA), De-pressives Anonymous, Recovery International, andGriefShare (grief recovery support groups). Althoughself-help groups are not psychotherapy groups, theydo provide important adjunctive support experiences,which often have therapeutic benefit for participants. Family Therapy The ultimate objectives in working with families ofclients with mood disorders are to resolve the symp-toms and initiate or restore adaptive family function-ing. As with group therapy, the most effective approachappears to be with a combination of psychotherapeuticand pharmacotherapeutic treatments. Sadock andSadock (2007) stated: Family therapy is indicated if the disorder jeopardizes the patient's marriage or family functioning or if themood disorder is promoted or maintained by thefamily situation. Family therapy examines the role ofthe mood-disordered member in the overall psycho-logical well-being of the whole family; it also exam-ines the role of the entire family in the maintenanceof the patient's symptoms. (p. 565) Cognitive Therapy In cognitive therapy, the individual is taught to con- trol thought distortions that are considered to be afactor in the development and maintenance of mooddisorders. In the cognitive model, depression is char-acterized by a triad of negative distortions related toexpectations of the environment, self, and future.The environment and activities within it are viewed asCHAPTER 25 Depressive Disorders 483 BOX 25-7 QSEN TEACHING STRATEGY\u2014cont'd 3.Observe RNs on the unit putting a client on suicide precautions and describe: a.

The general goals in cognitive therapy are to obtain symptom relief as quickly as possible, to assist theclient in identifying dysfunctional patterns of thinkingand behaving, and to guide the client to evidence andlogic that effectively tests the validity of the dysfunc-tional thinking (see Chapter 19). Therapy focuses onchanging \"automatic thoughts\" that occur sponta-neously and contribute to the distorted affect. Exam-ples of automatic thoughts in depression include: Personalizing: \"I'm the only one who failed.\" a complete thinks I'm foolish.\" Discounting positives: \"The other questions were so easy. Any dummy could have gotten them right.\" The client is asked to describe evidence that both supports and disputes the automatic thought. Thelogic underlying the inferences is then reviewed withthe client. Another technique involves evaluating whatwould most likely happen if the client's automaticthoughts were true. Implications of the consequencesare then discussed. Clients should not become discouraged if one technique seems not to be working. No single tech-nique works with all clients. He or she should be re-assured that any of a number of techniques may beused, and both therapist and client may explore thesepossibilities. Cognitive therapy has offered encouraging results in the treatment of depression. In fact, the results ofseveral studies with depressed clients show that in somecases cognitive therapy may be equally or even moreeffective than antidepressant medication (Rupke,Blecke, & Renfrow, 2006). Electroconvulsive Therapy Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the induction ofa grand mal (generalized) seizure through the appli-cation of electrical current to the brain. ECT is effec-tive with clients who are acutely suicidal and in thetreatment of severe depression, particularly in thoseclients who are also experiencing psychotic symptomsand those with psychomotor retardation and neu-rovegetative changes, such as disturbances in sleep,appetite, and energy. It is often considered for treat-ment only after a trial of therapy with antidepressantmedication has proved ineffective (see Chapter 20 fora detailed discussion of ECT). Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a proce-dure that is used to treat depression by targeting cer-tain cells in the brain. TMS involves the use of veryshort pulses of magnetic energy to stimulate nervecells in the brain, similar to the electrical activity ob-served with ECT. However, unlike ECT, the electricalwaves generated by TMS do not result in generalizedseizure activity (George, Taylor, & Short, 2013). Thewaves are passed through a coil placed on the scalpto areas of the brain involved in mood regulation.Some clinicians believe that TMS holds a great dealof promise in the treatment of depression, whereasothers remain skeptical. In rare instances, seizures havebeen triggered with the use of TMS therapy (Lanocha,2010). In a study at King's College in London, re-searchers compared the efficacy of TMS with ECT inthe treatment of severe depression (Eranti et al.,2007). They concluded that ECT was substantiallymore effective for the short-term treatment of depres-sion, and they indicated the need for further intenseclinical evaluation of TMS. George and associates (2013) stated: Since FDA approval, TMS has been generally safe and well tolerated with a low incidence of treatment discon-tinuation, and the therapeutic effects once obtainedappear at least as durable as other antidepressant treat-ments. TMS also shows promise in several other psychi-atric disorders, particularly treating acute and chronicpain. (p. 17) Light Therapy Between 15 and 25 percent of people with recurrent depressive disorder exhibit a seasonal pattern wherebysymptoms are exacerbated during the winter monthsand subside during the spring and summer (Thase,2007). The DSM-5 identifies this disorder as Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, With Seasonal Pattern.It has commonly been known as seasonal affective dis-order (SAD). Bright light therapy has been suggestedas a first-line treatment for winter \"blues\" and as an ad-junct in chronic major depressive disorder or dysthymiawith seasonal exacerbations (Karasu, Gelenberg, Merriam, & Wang, 2006). SAD is thought to be related to the presence of the hormone melatonin, which is produced by the pinealgland. Melatonin plays a role in the regulation of biological rhythms for sleep and activation. It is pro-duced during the cycle of darkness and shuts off inthe light of day. During the months of longer dark-ness hours, there is increased production of mela-tonin, which seems to trigger the symptoms of SADin susceptible people. Light therapy, or exposure to light, has been shown to be an effective treatment for SAD. The lighttherapy is administered by a 10,000-lux light box,which contains white fluorescent light tubes coveredwith a plastic screen that blocks ultraviolet rays. The484 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch25_458-497 24/07/14 5:29 PM Page 484individual sits in front of the box with the eyes open (although they should not look directly into thelight). Therapy usually begins with 10- to 15-minute ses-sions, and gradually progresses to 30 to 45 minutes.Some people notice improvement rapidly, within a few days, whereas others may take several weeks to feelbetter. Side effects appear to be dosage related, and include headache, eyestrain, nausea, irritability, photo-phobia (eye sensitivity to light), insomnia (when lighttherapy is used late in the day), and (rarely) hypomania(Terman & Terman, 2005). Light therapy and antide-pressants have shown comparable efficacy in studies ofSAD treatment. One study compared the efficacy oflight therapy for SAD to daily treatment with 20 mg offluoxetine (Lam et al., 2006). The authors concludedthat, \"Light treatment showed earlier response onsetand lower rate of some adverse events relative to fluox-etine, but there were no other significant differences in outcome between light therapy and antidepressantmedication\" (p. 805). Psychopharmacology Historical Aspects Antidepressant medication had a serendipitous begin-ning. In the early 1950s, patients with tuberculosis werebeing treated with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor(MAOI) iproniazid. Although the drug proved ineffec-tive for tuberculosis, it was found that patients exhib-ited a sustained elevation of mood while taking themedication (Schatzberg, Cole, & DeBattista, 2010).Following the initial enthusiasm about MAOIs, they fellinto relative disuse for nearly two decades because of aperceived poor risk-to-benefit ratio.The tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) had a similar introduction. In the late 1950s, imipramine was beinginvestigated as a treatment for schizophrenia, and although it did not relieve psychotic symptoms, it ap-peared to elevate mood. For almost 50 years, theTCAs have been widely used to treat depression. Sincethe initial discovery of their antidepressant proper-ties, they have been subjected to hundreds of con-trolled trials, and their efficacy in treating depressiveillness is now firmly established. The success of these first two groups of antidepres- sants led the pharmaceutical industry to search forcompounds with similar efficacy and fewer side effectsthan the MAOIs and the TCAs. Examples of com-monly used antidepressant medications are presentedin Table 25-3. A detailed description of these medica-tions follows. Indications Antidepressant medications are used in the treat-ment of dysthymia; major depression with melancho-lia or psychotic symptoms; depression associated withorganic disease, alcoholism, schizophrenia, or intel-lectual developmental disorder; depressive phase ofbipolar disorder; and depression accompanied byanxiety. These drugs elevate mood and alleviateother symptoms associated with moderate to severedepression. Selected agents are also used to treat anx-iety disorders, bulimia nervosa, and premenstrualdysphoric disorder. Action These drugs ultimately work to increase the concentra-tion of norepinephrine, serotonin, and/or dopamineCHAPTER 25 Depressive Disorders 485 TABLE 25-3 Medications Used in the Treatment of Depression GENERIC PREGNANCY DAILY ADULT THERAPEUTIC (TRADE) CATEGORIES/ DOSAGE PLASMA CHEMICAL CLASS NAME* HALF-LIFE Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation TABLE 25-3 Medications Used in the Treatment of Depression-cont'd GENERIC PREGNANCY DAILY ADULT THERAPEUTIC (TRADE) CATEGORIES/ DOSAGE PLASMA CHEMICAL CLASS NAME* HALF-LIFE (hr) well establishedNot well established Not well established Not well established Not well established Not well establishedNot well established Not well established Not well establishedNot well establishedNot well established Not well established 200-300 (incl. metabolite) Not well establishedNot well established800-1600 Not well established Not well establishedNot well establishedNot well established Not well established Not well establishedNot well established *Drugs without trade names are available in generic form only.

Caution should be used in administering these med- ications to elderly or debilitated clients and those with hepatic, renal, or cardiac insufficiency. (The dosageusually must be decreased.) Caution is also requiredwith psychotic clients, with clients who have benignprostatic hypertrophy, and with individuals who have ahistory of seizures (may decrease seizure threshold). CLINICAL PEARL As these drugs take effect, and mood begins to lift, the individual may have increased energy with which toimplement a suicide plan. Suicide potential often increases aslevel of depression decreases. The nurse should be particularly alert to sudden lifts in mood.

Nausea*Medication may be taken with food to minimize GI distress. Discontinuation syndrome*All classes of antidepressants have varying poten- tials to cause long-term therapy SSRIs,venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, levomilnacipran, orduloxetine may result in dizziness, lethargy,headache, and nausea. Fluoxetine is less likely to re-sult in withdrawal symptoms because of its long half-life. Abrupt withdrawal from tricyclics may producehypomania, akathisia, cardiac arrhythmias, gastroin-testinal upset, and panic attacks. The discontinua-tion syndrome associated with MAOIs includesflulike symptoms, confusion, hypomania, and wors-ening of depressive symptoms. All antidepressantmedication should be tapered gradually to preventwithdrawal symptoms (Schatzberg et al., 2010). Most Commonly Occur With Tricyclics and Heterocyclics Blurred vision *Offer reassurance that this symptom should sub- side after a few weeks. *Instruct the client not to drive until vision is clear.*Clear small items from routine pathway to prevent falls. Constipation*Order foods high in fiber; increase fluid intake if not contraindicated; and encourage the client toincrease physical exercise, if possible. Urinary retention*Instruct the client to report hesitancy or inability to urinate. *Monitor intake and output.*Try various methods to stimulate urination, such as running water in the bathroom or pouringwater over the perineal area. Orthostatic hypotension*Instruct the client to rise slowly from a lying or sitting position. *Monitor blood pressure (lying and standing) fre- quently, and document and report significantchanges. *Avoid long hot showers or tub baths. Reduction of seizure threshold*Observe clients with history of seizures closely.*Institute seizure precautions as specified in hospi- tal procedure manual. *Bupropion (Wellbutrin) should be administered in doses of no more than 150 mg and should begiven at least 4 hours apart. Bupropion has beenassociated with a relatively high incidence ofseizure activity in anorexic and cachectic clients. Tachycardia; arrhythmias*Carefully monitor blood pressure and pulse rate and rhythm, and report any significant change tothe physician. Photosensitivity*Ensure that client wears sunblock lotion, protec- tive clothing, and sunglasses while outdoors. Weight gain*Provide instructions for reduced-calorie diet.*Encourage increased level of activity, if appropriate. Most Commonly Occur With SSRIs and SNRIs Insomnia; agitation*Administer or instruct client to take dose early in the day. *Instruct client to avoid caffeinated food and drinks.*Teach relaxation techniques to use before bedtime. Headache*Administer analgesics, as prescribed.*If relief is not achieved, physician may order an- other antidepressant. Weight loss (may occur early in therapy)*Ensure that client is provided with caloric intake sufficient to maintain desired weight. *Caution should be taken in prescribing these drugs for anorectic clients. *Weigh client daily or every other day, at the same time, and on the same scale, if possible. *After prolonged use, some clients may gain weight on these drugs. Sexual dysfunction*Men may report abnormal ejaculation or impotence.*Women may experience delay or loss of orgasm.*If side effect becomes intolerable, a switch to an- other antidepressant may be necessary.

Application site reactions (with selegiline transder-mal system [Emsam])*The most common reactions include rash, itching, erythema, irritation, swelling, or urticarial lesions.Most reactions resolve spontaneously, requiring notreatment. However, if reaction becomes problem-atic, it should be reported to the physician. Topicalcorticosteroids have been used in treatment. Miscellaneous Side Effects Priapism (with trazodone)*Priapism is a rare side effect, but it has occurred in some men taking trazodone. *If prolonged or inappropriate penile erection oc- curs, the medication should be withheld and thephysician notified immediately.*Priapism can become very problematic, requiring surgical intervention, and, if not treated success-fully, can result in impotence. Hepatic failure (with nefazodone)*Cases of life-threatening hepatic failure have been reported in clients treated with nefazodone. *Advise clients to be alert for signs or symptoms sug- gestive of liver dysfunction (e.g., jaundice, anorexia,GI complaints, or malaise) and to report them tothe physician immediately. Client/Family Education Related to Antidepressants The client should: Continue to take the medication even though thesymptoms have not subsided. The therapeutic ef-fect may not be seen for as long as 4 weeks. If afterthis length of time no improvement is noted, thephysician may prescribe a different medication. Use caution when driving or operating dangerous ma-chinery. Drowsiness and dizziness can occur. If theseside effects become persistent or interfere with activi-ties of daily living, the client should report them to thephysician. Dosage adjustment may be necessary. Not discontinue use of the drug abruptly. To do somight produce withdrawal symptoms, such as nau-sea, vertigo, insomnia, headache, malaise, night-mares, and return of symptoms for which themedication was prescribed. Use sunblock lotion and wear protective clothingwhen spending time outdoors. The skin may besensitive to sunburn. Report occurrence of any of the following symptomsto the physician immediately: sore throat, fever,malaise, yellowish skin, unusual bleeding, easy bruis-ing, persistent nausea/vomiting, severe headache,rapid heart rate, difficulty urinating, anorexia/weightloss, seizure activity, stiff or sore neck, and chest pain. Rise slowly from a sitting or lying position to pre-vent a sudden drop in blood pressure. Take frequent sips of water, chew sugarless gum, orsuck on hard candy if dry mouth is a problem.Good oral care (frequent brushing, flossing) is veryimportant. Not consume the following foods or medicationswhile taking MAOIs: aged cheese, wine (especiallyChianti), beer, chocolate, colas, coffee, tea, sourcream, smoked and processed meats, beef or chickenliver, canned figs, soy sauce, overripe and fermentedfoods, pickled herring, raisins, caviar, yogurt, yeastproducts, broad beans, cold remedies, diet pills. To doso could cause a life-threatening hypertensive crisis. Avoid smoking while receiving tricyclic therapy.Smoking increases the metabolism of tricyclics, requiring an adjustment in dosage to achieve thetherapeutic effect.490 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch25_458-497 24/07/14 5:29 PM Page 490Avoid drinking alcohol while taking antidepressant therapy. These drugs potentiate the effects of eachother. Avoid use of other medications (including over-the-counter medications) without the physician'sapproval while receiving antidepressant therapy.Many medications contain substances that, in com-bination with antidepressant medication, couldprecipitate a life-threatening hypertensive crisis. Notify physician immediately if inappropriate orprolonged penile erections occur while taking tra-zodone. If the erection persists longer than 1 hour,seek emergency department treatment. This con-dition is rare, but has occurred in some men whohave taken trazodone. If measures are not insti-tuted immediately, impotence can result. Not \"double up\" on medication if a dose of bupropion(Wellbutrin) is missed, unless advised to do so by thephysician. Taking bupropion in divided doses will decrease the risk of seizures and other adverse effects. Follow the correct procedure for applying theselegiline transdermal patch: Apply to dry, intact skin on upper torso, upperthigh, or outer surface of upper arm.Apply approximately same time each day to newspot on skin, after removing and discarding oldpatch. Wash hands thoroughly after applying the patch. Avoid exposing application site to direct heat(e.g., heating pads, electric blankets, heat lamps,hot tub, or prolonged direct sunlight). If patch falls off, apply new patch to a new siteand resume previous schedule. Be aware of possible risks of taking antidepres-sants during pregnancy. Safe use during preg-nancy and lactation has not been fully established.These drugs are believed to readily cross the pla-cental barrier; if so, the fetus could experience ad-verse effects of the drug. Inform the physicianimmediately if pregnancy occurs, is suspected, oris planned. Be aware of the side effects of antidepressants.Refer to written materials furnished by health-careproviders for safe self-administration. Carry a card or other identification at all times de-scribing the medications being taken.CHAPTER 25 Depressive Disorders 491 CASE STUDY AND SAMPLE CARE PLAN NURSING HISTORY AND ASSESSMENT Sam is a 45-year-old white male admitted to the psychi- atric unit of a general medical center by his family physi-cian, Dr. Jones, who reported that Sam had becomeincreasingly despondent over the past month. His wife re-ported that he had made statements such as, \"Life is notworth living,\" and \"I think I could just take all those pills Dr. Jones prescribed at one time; then it would all be over.\"Sam says he loves his wife and children and does notwant to hurt them, but feels they no longer need him. Hestates, \"They would probably be better off without me.\"His wife appears to be very concerned about his condition,although in his despondency, he seems oblivious to herfeelings. His mother (a widow) lives in a neighboring state,and he sees her infrequently. His father was an alcoholicand physically abused Sam and his siblings. He admits thathe is somewhat bitter toward his mother for allowing himand his siblings to \"suffer from the physical and emotionalbrutality of their father.\" His siblings and their families livein distant states, and he sees them rarely, during holidaygatherings. Sam earned a college degree working full-time at night to pay his way. He is employed in the administration de-partment of a large corporation. Over the past 12 years,Sam has watched while a number of his peers were pro-moted to management positions. Sam has been consid-ered for several of these positions but has never beenselected. Last month a management position became avail-able for which Sam felt he was qualified. He applied for thisposition, believing he had a good chance of being promoted.However, when the announcement was made, the positionhad been given to a younger man who had been with thecompany only 5 years. Sam seemed to accept the decision,but over the past few weeks he has become more and morewithdrawn. He speaks to very few people at the office andis becoming more and more behind in his work. At home,he eats very little, talks to family members only when theyask a direct question, withdraws to his bedroom very earlyin the evening, and does not come out until time to leavefor work the next morning. Today, he refused to get out ofbed or to go to work. His wife convinced him to talk to theirfamily doctor, who admitted him to the hospital. The referringpsychiatrist diagnosed Sam with major depressive disorder. NURSING DIAGNOSES/OUTCOME IDENTIFICATION From the assessment data, the nurse develops the following nursing diagnoses for Sam: 1.Risk for suicide related to depressed mood and expres- sions of having nothing to live for . a. Short-Term Goals: Sam will seek out staff when ideas of suicide occur. Sam will maintain a short-term contract not to harmhimself.

Long-Term Goal: Sam will not harm himself during his hospitalization. 2.Complicated grieving related to unresolved losses (job promotion and unsatisfactory parent-child relationships)evidenced by anger turned inward on self and desireto end his life. a.Shor t-Term Goal: Sam will verbalize anger toward boss and parentswithin 1 week. b. Long-Term Goal: Sam will verbalize his position in the grief processand begin movement in the progression towardresolution by time of discharge from treatment. PLANNING/IMPLEMENTATION RISK FOR SUICIDE The following nursing interventions have been identifiedfor Sam: 1.Ask Sam directly, \"Have you thought about killing your- self? If so, what do you plan to do? Do you have themeans to carry out this plan?\" 2.Create a safe environment. Remove all potentiallyharmful objects from immediate access (sharp objects,straps, belts, ties, glass items). 3.Formulate a short-term verbal contract with Sam thathe will not harm himself during the next 2 4 hours. When that contract expires, make another. Continuewith this intervention until Sam is discharged. 4.Secure a promise from Sam that he will seek out a staffmember if thoughts of suicide emerge. 5.Encourage verbalizations of honest feelings. Throughexploration and discussion, help him to identify symbolsof hope in his life (par ticipating in activities he finds satisfying outside of his job). 6.Allow Sam to express angry feelings within appropriatelimits. Encourage use of the exercise room and punch-ing bag each day . Help him to identify the true source of his anger , and work on adaptive coping skills for use outside the hospital (e.g., jogging, exercise club avail-able to employees of his company). 7.Identify community resources that he may use as a sup-port system and from whom he may request help if feeling suicidal (e.g., suicidal or crisis hotline; psychiatristor social worker at community mental health center;hospital \"H ELP\" line). 8.Introduce Sam to support and education groups foradult children of alcoholics (A C OA). 9.Spend time with Sam. This will help him to feel safeand secure while conveying the message that he is awort hwhile person. COMPLICATED GRIEVING The following nursing interventions have been identifiedfor Sam: 1.Sam is fixed in the anger stage of the grieving process.Discuss with him behaviors associated with this stage, so that he may come to realize why he is feelingthis way . 2.Develop a trusting relationship with Sam. Show empa-thy and caring. Be honest and keep all promises. 3.Convey an accepting attitude\u2014one in which he is notafraid to express feelings openly . 4.Allow him to verbalize feelings of anger . The initial expression of anger may be displaced on to the health-care provider . Do not become defensive if this should occur. Assist him to explore these angry feelings so thatthey may be directed toward the intended persons(boss, parents). 5.Have Sam write letters (not to be mailed) to his bossand to his parents stating his true feelings toward them.Discuss these feelings with him; then destroy the letters. 6.Assist Sam to discharge pent-up anger through partici-pation in large motor activities (brisk walks, jogg ing, physical exercises, volleyball, punching bag, exercisebike, or other equipment). 7.Explain normal stages of g rief, and the behaviors asso- ciated with each stage. Help Sam to understand thatfeelings such as guilt and anger toward his boss andparents are appropriate and acceptable during this stageof the g rieving process. Help him also to understand that he must work through these feelings and movepast this stage in order to eventually feel better . Knowl- edge of acceptability of the feelings associated with nor-mal grieving may help to relieve some of the guilt thatthese responses generate. Knowing why he is experi-encing these feelings may also help to resolve them. 8.Encourage Sam to review the relationship with his par-ents. W ith suppor t and sensitivity, point out the reality of the situation in areas in which misrepresentations areexpressed. Explain common roles and behaviors ofmembers in an alcoholic family. Sam must give up thedesire for an idealized family and accept the reality ofhis childhood situation and the effect it has had on hisadult life, before the grief process can be completed. 9.Assist Sam in problem solving as he attempts to deter-mine methods for more adaptive coping. Suggest alternatives to anger turned inward on the self whennegative thinking sets in (e.g., thought-stopping tech-niques). Provide positive feedback for strateg ies iden- tified and decisions made. 10.Encourage Sam to reach out for spiritual support duringthis time in whatever form is desirable to him. Assessspiritual needs (see Chapter 6), and assist as necessaryin the fulfillment of those needs. Sam may find comfor t in relig ious rituals with which he is familiar. EVALUATION The outcome criteria identified for Sam have been met. Hesought out staff when feelings of suicide surfaced. He main-tained an active no-suicide contract. He has not harmedhimself in any way. He verbalizes no further thought of suicide and expresses hope for the future. He is able to 4092_Ch25_458-497 24/07/14 5:29 PM Page 492Summary and Key Points Depression is one of the oldest recognized psychi- atric illnesses that is still prevalent today. It is socommon, in fact, that it has been referred to as the\"common cold of psychiatric disorders.\" The cause of depressive disorders is not entirelyknown. A number of factors, including genetics, bio-chemical influences, and psychosocial experiences,likely enter into the development of the disorder. Secondary depression occurs in response to otherphysiological disorders. Symptoms of depression occur along a continuumaccording to the degree of severity from transientto severe.The disorder occurs in all developmental levels, including childhood, adolescence, senescence, andduring the puerperium. Treatment of depression includes individual ther-apy, group and family therapy, cognitive therapy,electroconvulsive therapy, light therapy, transcranialmagnetic stimulation, and psychopharmacology. Nursing care of the depressed client is providedusing the six steps of the nursing process.CHAPTER 25 Depressive Disorders 493 CASE STUDY AND SAMPLE CARE PLAN\u2014cont'd verbalize names of resources outside the hospital from whom he may request help if thoughts of suicide return.He is able to verbalize normal stages of the grief processand behaviors associated with each stage. He is able toidentify his own position in the grief process and expresshonest feelings related to the loss of his job promotion andsatisfactory parent-child relationships. He is no longer man-ifesting exaggerated emotions and behaviors related to com-plicated grieving, and is able to carry out self-care activitiesindependently.

(2012). Using short-term group psychotherapy as an evidence-based interven-tion for first-time mothers at risk for postpartum de-pression. Perspectives in Psychiatric Care. doi:10.1111/j .1744-6163.2012.00350.x DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to determine if an 8-week, shor t-term psychotherapy g roup decreased the risk of developing postpartum depression (PPD) among first-time mothers at risk for PPD. The sam-ple consisted of 16 women between the ages of 20 and38 (mean 28.5 yrs.). All were Caucasian, and the majoritywere Catholic. Thirteen were married, 2 were partnered,and one participant was single. Two psychotherapy groupswith 8 women in each group met once a week for 8 weeksbeginning 1 month after discharge from the hospital. Eachsession lasted 90 minutes, and both groups were led bythe same advanced practice psychiatric nurse practitioner.All subjects had completed the Edinburgh Postnatal De-pression Scale (EPDS) within 3 days of giving birth, and allhad scored 11 or higher, which was targeted as a high-riskfor PPD score by the participant hospital (a communityhospital in New Jersey). The psychotherapy groups fol-lowed an unstructured format, with an interpersonal-focused theoretical model. The authors stated, \"This focuswas structured to provide optimal opportunity in developingskills relative to their new maternal roles as new mothers,coping with depression and stress, honing communicationskills with their husbands and partners, and sharing their in-dividual, weekly experiences. The EPDS was administeredto all participants at the end of the 8 sessions. RESULTS OF THE STUDY: The mean preintervention score on the EP DS for g roup 1 was 16.13, and for group 2, the mean score was 15.5, placing participants from both groups at high risk for PPD. Following the intervention, the mean scorefor group 1 participants was 6.38 and for group 2 was 6.63.The EPDS was administered at 6-months postinterventionto determine the long-term effects. At that time, both groupsdemonstrated a significant decrease in scores on the EPDS,demonstrating a continued effect of the group interventionfor participants. The authors stated, \"This is suggestive thatgroup psychotherapy can have long-term effects to reducerisk for PPD for first-time mothers.\" IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The results of this study indicate that, par ticularly in those states that mandate screening for P PD, implementing nonpharmacologic inter- ventions such as short-term group psychotherapy provides a choice for women who decide against the use of medica-tion. The authors stated, \"In today's mental health servicesmarket, significant focus is paid on the importance of med-ication management skills of the psychiatric APN, yet the in-tervention in this project supports the need for continuededucation and training of advanced practice psychiatric nurs-ing as psychotherapists with group psychotherapy skills.\" TEST YOUR CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS Carol is a 17-year-old high school senior. She will graduate in 1 month and has plans to attend the state university a few hours from her home.Carol has always made good grades in school, has participated in manyactivities, and has been a pep squad cheerleader. She had been datingthe star quarterback, Alan, since last summer, and they had spoken anumber of times about going to the senior prom together. About amonth before the prom, Alan broke up with Carol and began datingSally, whom he subsequently took to the prom. Since that time, Carolhas become despondent. She doesn't go out with her friends; shedropped out of the pep squad; her grades have fallen; and she haslost 10 pounds. She attends classes most of the time, but eveningsand weekends she spends in her room alone listening to her music,crying, and sleeping. Her parents have become very concerned andcontacted the family physician, who has had Carol admitted to the psychiatric unit of the local hospital. The admitting psychiatrist has made the diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Carol tells the nurse,\"Sometimes I drive around and try to find Alan and Sally. I don't knowwhy he broke up with me. I hate myself! I just want to die!\" Answer the following questions related to Carol: 1.What is the primary nursing diagnosis that is identified for Carol? 2.To determine the seriousness of this problem, what are impor-tant nursing assessments that must be made? 3.What medication might the physician order for Carol? 4.What concern has the FDA identified that is associated withthis medication?

Predisposing factors that have been implicated in the etiology of bipolardisorder provide a framework for studying the dynam-ics of the disorder. The implications of bipolar disorder relevant to children and adolescents are discussed. An explana-tion of the symptomatology is presented as back-ground knowledge for assessing the client with bipolardisorder. Nursing care is described in the context ofthe six steps of the nursing process. Various medicaltreatment modalities are explored.Epidemiology Bipolar disorder affects approximately 5.7 millionAmerican adults, or about 2.6 percent of the U.S.population age 18 and older in a given year (NationalInstitute of Mental Health [NIMH], 2013). In termsof gender, the incidence of bipolar disorder is roughlyequal, with a ratio of women to men of about 1.2 to 1.The average age of onset for bipolar disorder is theearly 20s, and following the first manic episode, thedisorder tends to be recurrent. As with depression,bipolar disorder appears to be more common in un-married than in married persons (Joska & Stein,2008). Unlike depressive disorders, bipolar disorderappears to occur more frequently among the highersocioeconomic classes (Sadock & Sadock, 2007).Bipolar disorder is the sixth leading cause of disabilityin the middle age group, and the loss of earnings andproductivity attributable to mood disorders (depres-sion and bipolar disorder) may amount to about $33 billion per year in the United States (Joska &Stein, 2008). Types of Bipolar Disorders A bipolar disorder is characterized by mood swingsfrom profound depression to extreme euphoria(mania), with intervening periods of normalcy. Delu-sions or hallucinations may or may not be a part of theclinical picture, and onset of symptoms may reflect aseasonal pattern. During a manic episode, the mood is elevated, expansive, or irritable. The disturbance is sufficientlysevere to cause marked impairment in occupationalfunctioning or in usual social activities or relation-ships with others or to require hospitalization to pre-vent harm to self or others. Motor activity is excessiveand frenzied. Psychotic features may be present. TheDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (APA, 2013) diagnostic criteria for a manic episode are presented in Box 26-1. A somewhat milder degree of this clinical symptom picture is called hypomania. Hypomania is not severeenough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to require hospitaliza-tion, and it does not include psychotic features. TheDSM-5 diagnostic criteria for a hypomanic episode are presented in Box 26-2. The diagnostic picture for depression associated with bipolar disorder is similar to that described formajor depressive disorder, with one major distinction:the client must have a history of one or more manicepisodes. When the symptom presentation includesrapidly alternating moods (sadness, irritability, eupho-ria) accompanied by symptoms associated with bothCHAPTER 26 Bipolar and Related Disorders 499 CORE CONCEPT Mania An alteration in mood that is expressed by feelings of elation, inflated self-esteem, grandiosity, hyperactivity,agitation, and accelerated thinking and speaking. Maniacan occur as a biological (organic) or psychological dis-order, or as a response to substance use or a generalmedical condition. Historical Perspective Documentation of the symptoms associated with bipolar disorder dates back to about the second cen-tury in ancient Greece. Aretaeus of Cappadocia, aGreek physician, is credited with associating these ex-tremes of mood as part of the same illness. It was notuntil much later, however, that his view gained some acceptance. In early writings, mania was categorized with all forms of \"severe madness.\" In 1025, the Persian physi-cian Avicenna wrote The Canon of Medicine , in which he described mania as \"bestial madness characterizedby rapid onset and remission, with agitation and irri-tability.\" He considered rabies as a kind of mania.(Youssef, Youssef, & Dening, 1996, p. 57). The modern concept of manic-depressive illness began to emerge in the 19th century. In 1854, JulesBaillarger presented information to the French Impe-rial Academy of Medicine in which he used the termdual-form insanity to describe the illness. In the same year, Jean-Pierre Falret described the same disorder,which he termed \"circular insanity\" (Nakate, 2011). Contemporary thinking has been shaped a great deal by the works of Emil Kraepelin, who first coinedthe term manic-depressive in 1913. His approach be-came the most widely accepted theory of the early1930s (Guadiz, 2011). In 1980, the American Psychi-atric Association adopted the term bipolar disorder as the diagnostic category for manic-depressive illness in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III).4092_Ch26_498-527 23/07/14 12:31 PM Page 499500 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation BOX 26-1 Diagnostic Criteria for Manic Episode A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, and abnormally and persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary). B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree, and represent a noticeable change from usualbehavior: 1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. 2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep). 3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. 4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. 5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed . 6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purp oseless non-goal-directed activity). 7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments). C. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features. D. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, or other treatment) or to another medical condition. Note: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy), but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of thattreatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and, therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis.

BOX 26-2 Diagnostic Criteria for Hypomanic Episode A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consecutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day. B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) have persisted, represent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have beenpresent to a significant degree: 1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. 2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep). 3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. 4.

Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation. 7. Excessive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments). C. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharacteristic of the individual when not symptomatic. D. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others.E. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. If there are psychotic features, the episode is, by definition, manic. F. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, or other treatment). NOTE: A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomani c episode diagnosis. However, caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms (particularly increased irritability, edginess oragitation following antidepressant use) are not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanic episode, nor necessarily indicative of a bipolar diathesis.

Bipolar I Disorder Bipolar I disorder is the diagnosis given to an individ-ual who is experiencing a manic episode or has a his-tory of one or more manic episodes. The client mayalso have experienced episodes of depression. This diagnosis is further specified by the current or mostrecent behavioral episode experienced. For example,the specifier might be single manic episode (to describe individuals having a first episode of mania) or thespecifier may be identified as current (or most recent) episode manic, hypomanic, mixed , or depressed (to describe individuals who have had recurrent mood episodes).Psychotic or catatonic features may also be noted. Bipolar II Disorder The bipolar II disorder diagnostic category is charac-terized by recurrent bouts of major depression withepisodic occurrence of hypomania. The individualwho is assigned this diagnosis may present with symp-toms (or history) of depression or hypomania. Theclient has never experienced a full manic episode. Thediagnosis may specify whether the current or most re-cent episode is hypomanic, depressed, or with mixedfeatures. If the current syndrome is a major depressiveepisode, psychotic or catatonic features may be noted. Cyclothymic Disorder The essential feature of cyclothymic disorder is a chronic mood disturbance of at least 2 years' duration,involving numerous periods of elevated mood that do not meet the criteria for a hypomanic episode andnumerous periods of depressed mood of insufficientseverity or duration to meet the criteria for majordepressive episode. The individual is never withoutthe symptoms for more than 2 months. The DSM-5 criteria for cyclothymic disorder are presented inBox 26-3. Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar Disorder The disturbance of mood associated with this disorder is considered to be the direct result of physiologicaleffects of a substance (e.g., ingestion of or withdrawalfrom a drug of abuse or a medication). The mood dis-turbance may involve elevated, expansive, or irritablemood, with inflated self-esteem, decreased need forsleep, and distractibility. The disorder causes clinicallysignificant distress or impairment in social, occupa-tional, or other important areas of functioning. Mood disturbances are associated with intoxication from substances such as alcohol, amphetamines, such as alco- hol, amphetamines, cocaine, sedatives, hypnotics, andanxiolytics. A number of medications have been known to evoke mood symptoms. Classifications include anes-thetics, analgesics, anticholinergics, anticonvulsants,antihypertensives, antiparkinsonian agents, antiulceragents, psy-chotropic medications, muscle relaxants, steroids, andsulfonamides. Some specific examples are included inthe discussion of predisposing factors associated withbipolar disorders.CHAPTER 26 Bipolar and Related Disorders 501 BOX 26-3 Diagnostic Criteria for Cyclothymic Disorder A. For at least 2 years (at least one year in children and adolescents) there have been numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms that do not meet criteria for hypomanic episode and numerous periods with depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode. B. During the above 2-year period (1 year in children and adolescents), the hypomanic and depressive periods have been present for at least half the time and the individual has not been without the symptoms for more than 2 months at a time. C. Criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode have never been met.D. The symptoms in Criterion A are not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. E. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). F. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

American Psychiatric Association.4092_Ch26_498-527 23/07/14 12:32 PM Page 501Bipolar Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition This disorder is characterized by an abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood andexcessive activity or energy that is judged to be the re-sult of direct physiological consequence of anothermedical condition (APA, 2013). The mood distur-bance causes clinically significant distress or impair-ment in social, occupational, or other important areasof functioning. Types of physiological influences areincluded in the discussion of predisposing factors associated with bipolar disorders. Predisposing Factors The exact etiology of bipolar disorder has yet to bedetermined. Scientific evidence supports a chemicalimbalance in the brain, although the cause of the im-balance remains unclear. Theories that consider acombination of hereditary factors and environmentaltriggers (stressful life events) appear to hold the mostcredibility. Biological Theories Genetics Research suggests that bipolar disorder strongly reflects an underlying genetic vulnerability. Evidencefrom family, twin, and adoption studies exists to sup-port this observation. Twin Studies Twin studies have indicated a concordance rate forbipolar disorder among monozygotic twins at 60 to 80 percent compared to 10 to 20 percent in dizygotictwins. Because monozygotic twins have identical genesand dizygotic twins share only approximately half theirgenes, this is strong evidence that genes play a majorrole in the etiology. Family Studies Family studies have shown that, if one parent hasbipolar disorder, the risk that a child will have the disorder is around 28 percent (Dubovsky, Davies, &Dubovsky, 2003). If both parents have the disorder, therisk is 2 to 3 times as great. This has also been shownto be the case in studies of children born to parentswith bipolar disorder who were adopted at birth andreared by adoptive parents without evidence of the dis-order. These results strongly indicate that genes playa role separate from that of the environment. Other Genetic Studies Soreff and McInnes (2012) state: Studies from the first series of genome-wide associa- tion studies have given combined support for genes, ANK3 (ankyrin G) chan-nel) in sample of 4,387 cases and 6,209 controls. The ANK3 protein is located on the first part of the axon and is involved in making the determination of whether a neuron will fire. Studies have shown thatlithium carbonate, the most common medicationused to prevent manic episodes, reduces expressionof ANK3 (NIMH, 2008). The CACNA1C protein reg- ulates the influx and outflow of calcium from thecells, and is the site of action of the calcium channelblockers sometimes used in the treatment of bipolardisorder. Biochemical Influences Biogenic Amines Early studies have associated symptoms of depressionwith a functional deficiency of norepinephrine anddopamine and mania with a functional excess of theseamines. The neurotransmitter serotonin appears toremain low in both states. One study at the Universityof Michigan using a presynaptic marker and positronemission tomography revealed an increased densityin the amine-releasing cells in the brains of peoplewith bipolar disorder compared to control subjects(Zubieta et al., 2000). It was hypothesized that theseexcess cells result in the altered brain chemistry thatis associated with the symptoms of bipolar disorder.Some support of this neurotransmitter hypothesis has been demonstrated by the effects of neurolepticdrugs that influence the levels of these biogenicamines to produce the desired effect. More recently, the biogenic amine hypothesis has been expanded to include another neurotransmitter,acetylcholine. Because cholinergic agents do haveprofound effects on mood, electroencephalogram,sleep, and neuroendocrine function, it has been sug-gested that the problem in depression and mania maybe an imbalance between the biogenic amines andacetylcholine. Cholinergic transmission is thought tobe excessive in depression and inadequate in mania(Dubovsky et al., 2003). Physiological Influences Neuroanatomical Factors Right-sided the limbic basal ganglia, and thalamus have been shown toinduce secondary mania. Magnetic resonance imagingstudies have revealed enlarged third ventricles andsubcortical white matter and periventricular hyperin-tensities in clients with bipolar disorder (Dubovsky et al., 2003). Medication Side Effects Certain medications used to treat somatic illnesseshave been known to trigger a manic response. The502 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch26_498-527 23/07/14 12:32 PM Page 502most common of these are the steroids frequently used to treat chronic illnesses such as multiple sclero-sis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Someclients whose first episode of mania occurred duringsteroid therapy have reported spontaneous recur-rence of manic symptoms years later. Amphetamines,antidepressants, and high doses of anticonvulsantsand narcotics also have the potential for initiating amanic episode (Dubovsky et al., 2003). Psychosocial Theories The credibility of psychosocial theories has declinedin recent years. Conditions such as schizophrenia andbipolar disorder are viewed as diseases of the brainwith biological etiologies. The etiology of these ill-nesses remains unclear, however, and it is possiblethat both biological and psychosocial factors (such asenvironmental stressors) may be influential (Soreff &McInnes, 2012). The Transactional Model Bipolar disorder most likely results from interactionsamong genetic, biological, and psychosocial determi-nants. Soreff and McInnes (2012) state, \"The cyclemay be directly linked to external stresses or the ex-ternal pressures may serve to exacerbate some under-lying genetic or biochemical predisposition.\" Thetransactional model takes into consideration thesevarious etiological influences, as well as those associ-ated with past experiences, existing conditions, andthe individual's perception of the event. Figure 26-1depicts the dynamics of bipolar mania, using theTransactional Model of Stress/Adaptation. Developmental Implications Childhood and Adolescence The lifetime prevalence of pediatric and adolescentbipolar disorders is estimated to be about 1 percent,but children and adolescents are often difficult to di-agnose (Nandagopal & DelBello, 2008). The develop-mental courses and symptom profiles of psychiatricdisorders in children are unique from those of adults;therefore, approaches to diagnosis and treatmentcannot merely rely on strategies examined and imple-mented in a typical adult population. A working group sponsored by the Child and Ado- lescent Bipolar Foundation (CABF) has developedconsensus guidelines for the diagnosis and treatmentof children with bipolar disorder. These guidelineswere presented in the March 2005 issue of the Jour- nal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and address diagnosis, comorbidity, acute treatment, and maintenance treatment (Kowatch et al., 2005).Symptoms of bipolar disorder are often difficult to assess in children, and they may also present withcomorbid conduct disorders or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Because there is a ge-netic component and children of bipolar adults areat higher risk, family history may be particularly im-portant (Nandagopal & DelBello, 2008). To differen-tiate between occasional spontaneous behaviors ofchildhood and behaviors associated with bipolar dis-order, the Consensus Group recommends that clini-cians use the FIND (frequency, intensity, number, andduration) strategy (Kowatch et al., 2005): Frequency: Symptoms occur most days in a week. Intensity: Symptoms are severe enough to cause extreme disturbance in one domain or moderatedisturbance in two or more domains. Number: Symptoms occur three or four times a day. Duration: Symptoms occur 4 or more hours a day. The symptoms associated with mania in children and adolescents are as follows. Regarding these symp-toms, Kowatch and associates (2005) state: For any of these symptoms to be counted as a manic symptom, they must exceed the FIND threshold. Additionally, they must occur in concert with othermanic symptoms because no one symptom is diagnos-tic of mania. (p. 215) Euphoric/expansive mood. Extremely happy, silly, or giddy. Irritable mood. Hostility and rage, often over trivial matters. The irritability may be accompanied by aggressive and/or self-injurious behavior. Grandiosity. Believing that his or her abilities are better than everyone else's. Decreased need for sleep. May sleep only 4 or 5 hours per night and wake up fresh and full of en-ergy the next day. Or he or she may get up in themiddle of the night and wander around the houselooking for things to do. Pressured speech. Rapid speech that is loud, intru- sive, and difficult to interrupt. Racing thoughts. Topics of conversation change rapidly, in a manner confusing to anyone listening. Distractibility. To consider distractibility a manic symptom, it needs to reflect a change from baselinefunctioning, needs to occur in conjunction with a\"manic\" mood shift, and cannot be accounted forexclusively by another disorder, particularly ADHD(Kowatch et al., 2005). Distractibility during amanic episode may be reflected in a child who isnormally a B or C student and is unable to focuson any school lessons.

Psychomotor agitation represents adistinct change from baseline behavior. Excessive involvement in pleasurable or risky activ-ities. Children with bipolar disorder are often hy- persexual, exhibiting behavior that has an erotic,pleasure-seeking quality about it (Kowatch et al.,2005). Adolescents may seek out sexual activitymultiple times in a day. Psychosis. In addition to core symptoms of mania, psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations anddelusions, are frequently present in children withbipolar disorder (Geller et al., 2002; Kafantaris,Dicker, Coletti, & Kane, 2001). Suicidality. Although not a core symptom of mania, children with bipolar disorder are at risk of suicidalideation, intent, plans, and attempts during a de-pressed or mixed episode or when psychotic (Gelleret al., 2002). Treatment Strategies Psychopharmacology Monotherapy with to be the first-line treatment(Kowatch et al., 2005). In the event of inadequate re-sponse to initial monotherapy, an alternate monother-apeutic agent is suggested. Augmentation with a secondmedication is indicated when monotherapy fails. In a recent study to examine current research data, Hazell and Jairam (2012) reported \"evidence favoringthe use of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), lim-ited evidence favoring the use of combinations of SGAwith a mood stabilizer, and no evidence supporting theuse of mood stabilizer monotherapy\" (p. 264). Fromtheir study, they suggest that the first-line treatment for mania in children and adolescents is a SGA, withcombination therapies offering no clear advantage. ADHD has been identified as the most common co- morbid condition in children and adolescents with bipo-lar disorder. Because stimulants can exacerbate mania,it is suggested that medication for ADHD be initiatedonly after bipolar symptoms have been controlled with amood stabilizing agent (McClellan, Kowatch, & bupropion, the tricyclic antidepres-sants) may also induce switches to mania or hypomania. Bipolar disorder in children and adolescents appears to be a chronic condition with a high risk ofrelapse. Maintenance therapy incorporates the samemedications used to treat acute symptoms, althoughfew research studies exist that deal with long-termmaintenance of bipolar disorder in children. TheConsensus Group recommends that medication tapering or discontinuation be considered after re-mission has been achieved for a minimum of 12 to 24 consecutive months. It was acknowledged, how-ever, that some clients may require long-term or evenlifelong pharmacotherapy (McClellan et al., 2007). Family Interventions Although pharmacologic treatment is acknowledged asthe primary method of stabilizing an acutely ill bipolarclient, adjunctive psychotherapy has been recognizedas playing an important role in preventing relapses andimproving adjustment. Correll (2007) stresses the im-portance of psychoeducational therapy to familiarizeboth the patient and the family with the symptoms,course, and impact of the disorder and the availabletreatment options. Correll (2007) states, \"Social andfamily function can be significantly disrupted by a childwith bipolar disorder. Patients and their families mayneed counseling in ways to address these disruptions.\"Relapse prevention, including the importance of treat-ment adherence, must be emphasized. Family dynamics and attitudes can play a crucial role in the outcome of a client's recovery. Interventions withfamily members must include education that promotesunderstanding that at least part of the client's negativebehaviors are attributable to an illness that must bemanaged, as opposed to being willful and deliberate. Studies show that family-focused psychoeducational treatment (FFT) is an effective method of reducing re-lapses and increasing medication adherence in bipolarclients (Miklowitz et al., 2003). FFT includes sessionsthat deal with psychoeducation about bipolar disorder(i.e., symptoms, early recognition, etiology, treatment,self-management), communication training, and prob-lem-solving skills training. Allen (2003) states: There are several important goals of FFT, which in- clude: improving communication within the family,teaching the family to recognize the early warningsigns of a relapse, teaching the family how to respondto these warning signs, and educating them regard-ing the necessary treatments. This education helpsfamilies gain some control over the conflict that occurs in the post-episode phases. There is evidence to suggest that the addition of psychosocial therapy enhances the effectiveness of psychopharmacological therapy in the maintenanceof bipolar disorder in children and adolescents. Application of the Nursing Process to Bipolar Disorder (Mania) Background Assessment Data Symptoms of manic states can be described accord-ing to three stages: hypomania, acute mania, anddelirious mania. Symptoms of mood, cognition andCHAPTER 26 Bipolar and Related Disorders 5054092_Ch26_498-527 23/07/14 12:32 PM Page 505perception, and activity and behavior are presented for each stage. Stage I: Hypomania At this stage the disturbance is not sufficiently severeto cause marked impairment in social or occupationalfunctioning or to require hospitalization (APA, 2013). Mood The mood of a hypomanic person is cheerful and expansive. There is an underlying irritability that sur-faces rapidly when the person's wishes and desires gounfulfilled, however. The nature of the hypomanicperson is very volatile and fluctuating (see Box 26-2). Cognition and Perception Perceptions of the self are exalted\u2014ideas of greatworth and ability. Thinking is flighty, with a rapid flowof ideas. Perception of the environment is height-ened, but the individual is so easily distracted by irrel-evant stimuli that goal-directed activities are difficult. Activity and Behavior Hypomanic individuals exhibit increased motor activ-ity. They are perceived as being very extroverted andsociable, and because of this they attract numerous ac-quaintances. However, they lack the depth of person-ality and warmth to formulate close friendships. Theytalk and laugh a great deal, usually very loudly andoften inappropriately. Increased libido is common.Some individuals experience anorexia and weight loss.The exalted self-perception leads some hypomanic in-dividuals to engage in inappropriate behaviors, suchas phoning the President of the United States, or buy-ing huge amounts on a credit card without having theresources to pay. Stage II: Acute Mania Symptoms of acute mania may be a progression in intensification of those experienced in hypomania,or they may be manifested directly. Most individualsexperience marked impairment in functioning andrequire hospitalization (see Box 26-1). Mood Acute mania is characterized by euphoria and elation.The person appears to be on a continuous \"high.\"However, the mood is always subject to frequent vari-ation, easily changing to irritability and anger or evento sadness and crying. Cognition and Perception Cognition and perception become fragmented andoften psychotic in acute mania. Rapid thinking pro-ceeds to racing and disjointed thinking (flight ofideas) and may be manifested by a continuous flow ofaccelerated, pressured speech (loquaciousness), withabrupt changes from topic to topic. When flight ofideas is severe, speech may be disorganized and incoherent. Distractibility becomes all-pervasive. At-tention can be diverted by even the smallest of stim-uli. Hallucinations and delusions (usually paranoidand grandiose) are common. Activity and Behavior Psychomotor activity is excessive. Sexual interest is increased. There is poor impulse control, and the in-dividual who is normally discreet may become sociallyand sexually uninhibited. Excessive spending is com-mon. Individuals with acute mania have the ability tomanipulate others to carry out their wishes, and ifthings go wrong, they can skillfully project responsi-bility for the failure onto others. Energy seems inex-haustible, and the need for sleep is diminished. Theymay go for many days without sleep and still not feeltired. Hygiene and grooming may be neglected. Dressmay be disorganized, flamboyant, or bizarre, and theuse of excessive makeup or jewelry is common. Stage III: Delirious Mania Delirious mania is a grave form of the disorder char-acterized by severe clouding of consciousness and anintensification of the symptoms associated with acutemania. This condition has become relatively rare sincethe availability of antipsychotic medication. Mood The mood of the delirious person is very labile. Heor she may exhibit feelings of despair, quickly convert-ing to unrestrained merriment and ecstasy or becom-ing irritable or totally indifferent to the environment.Panic anxiety may be evident. Cognition and Perception Cognition and perception are characterized by aclouding of consciousness, with accompanying confu-sion, disorientation, and sometimes stupor. Othercommon manifestations include religiosity, delusionsof grandeur or persecution, and auditory or visual hal-lucinations. The individual is extremely distractibleand incoherent. Activity and Behavior Psychomotor activity is frenzied and characterized byagitated, purposeless movements. The safety of theseindividuals is at stake unless this activity is curtailed.Exhaustion, injury to self or others, and eventuallydeath could occur without intervention. Diagnosis/Outcome Identification Using information collected during the assessment,the nurse completes the client database, from whichthe selection of appropriate nursing diagnoses is de-termined. Table 26-1 presents a list of client behaviorsand the NANDA nursing diagnoses that correspond506 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch26_498-527 23/07/14 12:32 PM Page 506to those behaviors, which may be used in planning care for the client experiencing a manic episode. Outcome Criteria The following criteria may be used for measuring out-comes in the care of the client experiencing a manicepisode. The client: Exhibits no evidence of physical injury Has not harmed self or others Is no longer exhibiting signs of physical agitation Eats a well-balanced diet with snacks to preventweight loss and maintain nutritional status Verbalizes an accurate interpretation of the envi-ronment Verbalizes that hallucinatory activity has ceased and demonstrates no outward behavior indicatinghallucinations Accepts responsibility for own behaviors Does not manipulate others for gratification of ownneeds Interacts appropriately with others Is able to fall asleep within 30 minutes of retiring Is able to sleep 6 to 8 hours per night without medication Planning/Implementation The following section presents a group of selectednursing diagnoses, with short- and long-term goalsand nursing interventions for each. Some institutions are using a case management model to coordinate care (see Chapter 9 for a more detailed explanation). In case management models, theplan of care may take the form of a critical pathway. Risk for Violence: Self-Directed or Other-Directed Risk for self- or other-directed violence is defined as \"at risk for behaviors in which an individual demonstratesthat he or she can be physically, emotionally, and/orsexually harmful to [self or to others]\" (NANDA-I,2012, pp. 447-448). NOTE: Please refer to Chapter 16 for additional concepts related to anger and aggres-sion management. Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goals Within [a specified time], client will recognizesigns of increasing anxiety and agitation and reportto staff (or other care provider) for assistance withintervention. Client will not harm self or others. Long-Term Goal Client will not harm self or others. Interventions Maintain a low level of stimuli in the client's envi-ronment (low lighting, few people, simple decor,low noise level). Anxiety level rises in a stimulatingenvironment. A suspicious, agitated client may per-ceive individuals as threatening. Observe the client's behavior frequently. Do thiswhile carrying out routine activities so as to avoidCHAPTER 26 Bipolar and Related Disorders 507 TABLE 26-1 Assigning Nursing Diagnoses to Behaviors Commonly Exhibited by Individuals Experiencing a Manic Episode BEHAVIORS NURSING DIAGNOSES Extreme hyperactivity; increased agitation and lack of control over purposeless and potentially injurious movements Manic excitement, delusional thinking, hallucinations, impulsivity Loss of weight, amenorrhea, refusal or inability to sit still long enough to eatDelusions of grandeur and persecution; inaccurate interpretation of the environment Auditory and visual hallucinations; disorientation Inability to develop satisfying relationships, manipulation of others for own desires, use of unsuccessful social interaction behaviors Difficulty falling asleep, sleeping only short periodsRisk for injury Risk for violence: Self-directed or other-directed Imbalanced nutrition: Less than body requirements Disturbed thought processes*Disturbed sensory perception* Impaired social interaction Insomnia *These diagnoses have been retired from the NANDA-I list of approved diagnoses. They are used in this instance because they are most compatible with the identified behaviors.4092_Ch26_498-527 23/07/14 12:32 PM Page 507creating suspiciousness in the individual. Close ob- servation is necessary so that intervention can occurif required to ensure client (and others') safety. Remove all dangerous objects from the client's en-vironment so that in his or her agitated, confusedstate the client may not use them to harm self orothers. Intervene at the first sign of increased anxi- ety, agitation, or verbal or behavioral aggres- sion. Offer empathetic response to client's feelings:\"You seem anxious (or frustrated, or angry) aboutthis situation. How can I help?\" Validation of theclient's feelings conveys a caring attitude and offer-ing assistance reinforces trust. It is important to maintain a calm attitude towardthe client. As the client's anxiety increases, offersome alternatives: participating in a physical activity(e.g., punching bag, physical exercise), talkingabout the situation, taking some antianxiety med-ication. Offering alternatives to the client gives himor her a feeling of some control over the situation. Have sufficient staff available to indicate a show ofstrength to the client if it becomes necessary. Thisshows the client evidence of control over the situa-tion and provides some physical security for staff. If the client is not calmed by \"talking down\" or bymedication, use of mechanical restraints may benecessary. CLINICAL PEARL The avenue of the \"least restrictive alterna- tive\" must be selected when planning interventions for a violentclient. Restraints should be used only as a last resort, after allother interventions have been unsuccessful, and the client is clearly at risk of harm to self or others. If restraint is deemed necessary, ensure that suffi- cient staff is available to assist. Follow protocol es-tablished by the institution. The Joint Commission(formerly the Joint Commission on Accreditationof Healthcare Organizations [JCAHO]) requiresthat an in-person evaluation by a physician or otherlicensed independent practitioner (LIP) be con-ducted within 1 hour of the initiation of the re-straint or seclusion (The Joint Commission, 2010).The physician or LIP must reissue a new order forrestraints every 4 hours for adults and every 1 to 2 hours for children and adolescents. The Joint Commission requires that the client inrestraints be observed at least every 15 minutes toensure that circulation to extremities is not com-promised (check temperature, color, pulses); to as-sist the client with needs related to nutrition,hydration, and elimination; and to position theclient so that comfort is facilitated and aspirationcan be prevented. Some institutions may require continuous one-to-one monitoring of restrained clients, particularly those who are highly agitated,and for whom there is a high risk of self- or acci-dental injury. As agitation decreases, assess the client's readinessfor restraint removal or reduction. Remove one restraint at a time while assessing the client's re-sponse. This minimizes the risk of injury to clientand staff. Impaired Social Interaction Impaired social interaction is defined as \"insufficient or excessive quantity or ineffective quality of social ex-change\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 320). Table 26-2 presentsthis nursing diagnosis in care plan format. Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal Client will verbalize which of his or her interactionbehaviors are appropriate and which are inappro-priate within 1 week. Long-Term Goal Client will demonstrate use of appropriate interactionskills as evidenced by lack of, or marked decrease in,manipulation of others to fulfill own desires. Interventions Recognize the purpose these behaviors serve for the client: to reduce feelings of insecurity by increasing feelings of power and control. Under-standing the motivation behind the manipulationmay help to facilitate acceptance of the individualand his or her behavior. Set limits on manipulative behaviors. Explain to theclient what is expected and what the consequencesare if the limits are violated. Terms of the limita-tions must be agreed on by all staff who will beworking with the client. The client is unable to es-tablish own limits, so this must be done for him orher. Unless administration of consequences for violation of limits is consistent, manipulative behav-ior will not be eliminated. Do not argue, bargain, or try to reason with theclient. Merely state the limits and expectations. Indi-viduals with mania can be very charming in their efforts to fulfill their own desires. Confront the clientas soon as possible when interactions with others aremanipulative or exploitative. Follow through with es-tablished consequences for unacceptable behavior.Because of the strong id influence on the client's be-havior, he or she should receive immediate feedbackwhen behavior is unacceptable. Consistency in enforcing the consequences is essential if positive508 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch26_498-527 23/07/14 12:32 PM Page 508CHAPTER 26 Bipolar and Related Disorders 509 Table 26-2 | CARE PLAN FOR THE CLIENT EXPERIENCING A MANIC EPISODE NURSING DIAGNOSIS: IMPAIRED SOCIAL INTERACTION RELATED TO: Delusional thought processes (gra ndeur and/or persecution); underdeveloped ego and low self-esteem EVIDENCED BY: Inability to develop satisfying relationships and manipulation of others for own desires OUTCOME CRITERIA NURSING INTERVENTIONS RATIONALE Short-Term Goal \u0081 Client will verbalize which of his or her interaction behaviors are appropriate and which are inappropriate within 1 week.

Insomnia is defined as \"a disruption in amount and quality of sleep that impairs functioning\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 217). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goals Client will consume sufficient finger foods and between-meal snacks to meet recommended dailyallowances of nutrients. Within 3 days, with the aid of a sleeping medication,client will sleep 4 to 6 hours without awakening. Long-Term Goals Client will exhibit no signs or symptoms of malnu-trition. By time of discharge from treatment, client will beable to acquire 6 to 8 hours of uninterrupted sleepwithout medication. Interventions In collaboration with the dietitian, determine thenumber of calories required to provide adequatenutrition for maintenance or realistic (accordingto body structure and height) weight gain. Deter-mine client's likes and dislikes, and try to providefavorite foods, if possible. The client is more likelyto eat foods that he or she particularly enjoys. Provide the client with high-protein, high-calorie,nutritious finger foods and drinks that can be consumed \"on the run.\" Because of the hyperactivestate, the client has difficulty sitting still longenough to eat a meal. The likelihood is greater thathe or she will consume food and drinks that can becarried around and eaten with little effort. Havejuice and snacks available on the unit at all times.Nutritious intake is required on a regular basis tocompensate for increased caloric requirementsdue to the hyperactivity. Maintain an accurate record of intake, output, andcalorie count. Weigh the client daily. Administer vi-tamin and mineral supplements, as ordered by thephysician. Monitor laboratory values, and reportsignificant changes to the physician. It is importantto carefully monitor the data that provide an objec-tive assessment of the client's nutritional status. Assess the client's activity level. He or she may ignoreor be unaware of feelings of fatigue. Observe forsigns such as increasing restlessness; fine tremors;slurred speech; and puffy, dark circles under eyes.The client could collapse from exhaustion if hyper-activity is uninterrupted and rest is not achieved. Monitor sleep patterns. Provide a structured sched-ule of activities that includes established times fornaps or rest. Accurate baseline data are importantin planning care to help the client with this prob-lem. A structured schedule, including time forshort naps, will help the hyperactive client achievemuch-needed rest. Client should avoid intake of caffeinated drinks,such as tea, coffee, and colas. Caffeine is a CNS stim-ulant and may interfere with the client's achieve-ment of rest and sleep. Before bedtime, provide nursing measures thatpromote sleep, such as back rub; bath; warm,nonstimulating drinks; soft music; and relaxationexercises. Administer sedative medications, as ordered, to as-sist client achieve sleep until normal sleep patternis restored. Concept Care Mapping The concept map care plan is an innovative approach toplanning and organizing nursing care (see Chapter 9).It is a diagrammatic teaching and learning strategy thatallows visualization of interrelationships between medicaldiagnoses, nursing diagnoses, assessment data, and treat-ments. An example of a concept map care plan for a client experiencing a manic episode is presented in Figure 26-2. Client/Family Education The role of client teacher is important in the psychi-atric area, as it is in all areas of nursing. A list of topicsfor client/family education relevant to bipolar disor-der is presented in Box 26-4. Evaluation of Care for the Client Experiencing a Manic Episode In the final step of the nursing process, a reassess- ment is conducted to determine if the nursing actionshave been successful in achieving the objectives ofcare. Evaluation of the nursing actions for the clientexperiencing a manic episode may be facilitated bygathering information using the following types ofquestions. Has the individual avoided personal injury? Has violence to client or others been prevented? Has agitation subsided? Have nutritional status and weight been stabilized?Is the client able to select foods to maintain ade-quate nutrition? Have delusions and hallucinations ceased? Is theclient able to interpret the environment correctly?510 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch26_498-527 23/07/14 12:32 PM Page 510CHAPTER 26 Bipolar and Related Disorders 511 Clinical Vignette: Sam and Janet had been engaged for a year. Three months ago, Sam called Janet and told her he didn't want to get married, and he was leaving to take a job in Japan. Janet became hysterical, then depressed,and then seemed to be accepting the situation. She got a new hairstyle, bought lots of new clothes, and startedgoing to lots of parties with her roommate, Nancy. She started losing weight, exercising excessively, and sleepingvery little. She became quite promiscuous. She stopped menstruating and said to Nancy, \"I wonder if I'm pregnant!\"Tonight she and Nancy went to a bar. Janet started buying drinks \"for the house.\" She became quite loud anddisruptive, climbing on the bar and announcing to the crowd that she had received a \"message\" that she would bethe winner of tonight's multimillion-dollar lottery. When the bar owner eventually asked her to leave, she becameviolent, striking out at him and destroying bar property. He called 911, and Janet was taken to the emergencydepartment of the hospital. She has been admitted to the psychiatric unit with Bipolar I Disorder, Manic Episode.She is agitated and restless. The nurse develops the following concept map care plan for Janet.

Does he or she understand thenecessity for monthly blood level checks? Treatment Modalities for Bipolar Disorder (Mania) Individual Psychotherapy Historically, clients with mania have been difficult can-didates for psychotherapy. They form a therapeutic re-lationship easily because they are eager to please andgrateful for the therapist's interest. However, the rela-tionship often tends to remain shallow and rigid.Some reports have indicated that psychotherapy (inconjunction with medication maintenance treatment)and counseling may indeed be useful with these indi-viduals. Goldberg and Hoop (2004) state: Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy is a form of interpersonal therapy tailored to bipolar patients. Inaddition to focusing on grief, role conflicts, role tran-sitions, and interpersonal deficiencies, it includes psy-choeducation about bipolar disorder and encouragestreatment adherence. [Studies have] suggested patients receiving moreoften euthymic [stable mood] than patients receivingonly clinical management. Group Therapy Once an acute phase of the illness is passed, groups can provide an atmosphere in which individuals maydiscuss issues in their lives that cause, maintain, orarise out of having a serious affective disorder. The element of peer support may provide a feeling of se-curity, as troublesome or embarrassing issues are dis-cussed and resolved. Some groups have other specificpurposes, such as helping to monitor medication-related issues or serving as an avenue for promotingeducation related to the affective disorder and itstreatment. Support groups help members gain a sense of per- spective on their condition and tangibly encouragethem to link up with others who have common prob-lems. A sense of hope is conveyed when the individualis able to see that he or she is not alone or unique inexperiencing affective illness. Self-help groups offer another avenue of support for the individual with bipolar disorder. These groups areusually peer led and are not meant to substitute for, orcompete with, professional therapy. They offer supple-mentary support that frequently enhances compliancewith the medical regimen. The Depression and BipolarSupport Alliance (DBSA) provides education and sup-port for individuals with bipolar disorder. Informationregarding local support groups is available on their web-site at http://www.dbsalliance.org. The Balanced Mindis a program of the DBSA that provides support for par-ents of children with bipolar disorder. Informationabout this program is available at http://www.thebalancedmind.org. Although self-help groups are notpsychotherapy groups, they do provide important adjunctive support experiences, which often have ther-apeutic benefit for participants. Family Therapy The ultimate objectives in working with families of clientswith mood disorders are to resolve the symptoms and initiate or restore adaptive family functioning. As withgroup therapy, the most effective approach appears tobe with a combination of psychotherapeutic and phar-macotherapeutic treatments. Some studies with bipolardisorder have shown that behavioral family treatment512 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation BOX 26-4 Topics for Client/Family Education Related to Bipolar Disorder NATURE OF THE ILLNESS 1.

Sadock and Sadock (2007) state: Family therapy is indicated if the disorder jeopardizes the patient's marriage or family functioning or if themood disorder is promoted or maintained by thefamily situation. Family therapy examines the role ofthe mood-disordered member in the overall psycho-logical well-being of the whole family; it also exam-ines the role of the entire family in the maintenanceof the patient's symptoms. (p. 555) Cognitive Therapy In cognitive therapy, the individual is taught to con- trol thought distortions that are considered to be afactor in the development and maintenance of mooddisorders. In the cognitive model, depression is char-acterized by a triad of negative distortions related toexpectations of the environment, self, and future.The environment and activities within it are viewed as unsatisfying, the self is unrealistically devalued, and the future is perceived as hopeless. In the samemodel, mania is characterized by exaggeratedly posi-tive cognitions and perceptions. The individual per-ceives the self as highly valued and powerful. Life isexperienced with overstated self-assurance, and thefuture is viewed with unrealistic optimism. The general goals in cognitive therapy are to obtain symptom relief as quickly as possible, to assist theclient in identifying dysfunctional patterns of thinkingand behaving, and to guide the client to evidence andlogic that effectively tests the validity of the dysfunc-tional thinking (see Chapter 19). Therapy focuses onchanging \"automatic thoughts\" that occur sponta-neously and contribute to the distorted affect. Exam-ples of automatic thoughts in bipolar mania include: Personalizing: \"She's this happy only when she's with me.\" All or nothing: \"Everything I do is \"She thinks I'm wonderful.\" Discounting negatives: \"None of those mistakes are really important.\" The client is asked to describe evidence that both supports and disputes the automatic thought. Thelogic underlying the inferences is then reviewed withthe client. Another technique involves evaluatingwhat would most likely happen if the client's auto-matic thoughts were true. Implications of the conse-quences are then discussed. Clients should not become discouraged if one technique seems not to be working. No single tech-nique works with all clients. He or she should be reassured that any of a number of techniques may beused, and both therapist and client may explorethese possibilities.Finally, the use of cognitive therapy does not pre- clude the value of administering medication. Partic-ularly in the treatment of bipolar mania, cognitivetherapy should be considered a secondary treatmentto pharmacological treatment. The Recovery Model Research provides support for recovery as an obtainableobjective for individuals with bipolar disorder. Concep-tual models of recovery from mental illness are pre-sented in Chapter 21. The Recovery Model has beenused primarily in caring for individuals with seriousmental illness, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disor-der. However, concepts of the model are amenable touse with all individuals experiencing emotional condi-tions with which they require assistance and who havea desire to take control and manage their lives more independently. Davidson (2007) has stated: Recovery from refers to eradicating the symptoms and ameliorating the deficits caused by serious mental ill- nesses. Recovery in refers to learning how to live a safe, dignified, full, and self-determined life in the face ofthe enduring disability which may, at times, be asso-ciated with serious mental illness. In bipolar disorder, recovery is a continuous process. The individual identifies goals based on per- sonal values or what he or she defines as giving mean-ing and purpose to life. The clinician and client worktogether to develop a treatment plan that is in align-ment with the goals set forth by the client. In the recovery process, the individual may still be experi-encing symptoms. Weiden (2010) states: Patients do not have to be in remission, nor does remission automatically have to be a desired (or likely) goal when embarking on a recovery-oriented treatment plan. As long as the patient(and family) understands that a process recoverytreatment plan is not to be confused with a promiseof \"cure\" or even \"remission,\" then one does notoverpromise. In the process of recovery, the client and clinician work on strategies to help the individual with bipolar disorder take control of and manage his or her illness.Some of these strategies include the following (NationalAlliance on Mental Illness [NAMI], 2008): Become an expert on the disorder Take medications regularly Become aware of earliest symptoms Develop a plan for emergencies Identify and reduce sources of stress: Know whento seek help Develop a personal support systemCHAPTER 26 Bipolar and Related Disorders 5134092_Ch26_498-527 23/07/14 12:32 PM Page 513During the process of recovery, individuals actively work on the strategies they have identified to keep themselves well. The clinician serves as a support per-son to help the individual take the necessary steps toachieve the goals previously set forth by the client.Powell (2006) states: People with bipolar disorder have the power to create the lives they want for themselves. When they workon recovery and are able to look beyond their illness,the possibilities are limitless. (p. 7) Although there is no cure for bipolar disorder, recovery is possible in the sense of learning to prevent and minimize symptoms, and to successfully copewith the effects of the illness on mood, career, and social life (Kiume, 2007). Electroconvulsive Therapy Episodes of acute mania are occasionally treated withelectroconvulsive therapy (ECT), particularly whenthe client does not tolerate or fails to respond tolithium or other drug treatment, or when life isthreatened by dangerous behavior or exhaustion (seeChapter 20 for a detailed discussion of ECT). Psychopharmacology With Mood- Stabilizing Agents For many years, the drug of choice for treatment and management of bipolar mania was lithium carbonate.However, in recent years, a number of investigatorsand clinicians in practice have achieved satisfactory re-sults with several other medications, either alone or incombination with lithium. Table 26-3 provides infor-mation about the indication, action, and contraindi-cations and precautions of various medications beingused as mood stabilizers. Drug interactions associatedwith mood stabilizers are presented in Table 26-4. Side Effects The plan of care should include monitoring for sideeffects of therapy with mood stabilizing agents and in-tervening when required to prevent the occurrenceof adverse events related to medication administra-tion. Side effects and nursing implications for moodstabilizing agents are presented in Table 26-5. Lithium Toxicity The margin between the therapeutic and toxic levelsof lithium carbonate is very narrow. The usual rangesof therapeutic serum concentrations are as follows(Drug Facts and Comparisons 2014; Schatzberg, Cole, & DeBattista, For acute mania: 1.5 mEq/L For maintenance: 0.6 to 1.2 mEq/L Serum lithium levels should be monitored once or twice a week after initial treatment until dosage andserum levels are stable, then monthly during mainte-nance therapy. Blood samples should be drawn 12 hoursafter the last dose. Symptoms of lithium toxicity begin to appear at blood levels greater than 1.5 mEq/L and are dosagedeterminate. Symptoms include the following: At serum levels of 1.5 to 2.0 mEq/L: blurred vision,ataxia, tinnitus, persistent nausea and vomiting, severe diarrhea. At serum levels of 2.0 to 3.5 mEq/L: excessive output of dilute urine, increasing tremors, mus-cular irritability, retardation, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, cardio-vascular collapse. Lithium levels should be monitored prior to medication administration. The dosage should bewithheld and the physician notified if the level reaches1.5 mEq/L or at the earliest observation or report bythe client of even the mildest symptom. If left un-treated, lithium toxicity can be life threatening. Lithium is similar in chemical structure to sodium, behaving in the body in much the same manner andcompeting at various sites in the body with sodium. Ifsodium intake is reduced or the body is depleted ofits normal sodium (e.g., due to excessive sweating,fever, or diuresis), lithium is reabsorbed by the kid-neys, increasing the possibility of toxicity. Therefore,the client must consume a diet adequate in sodiumas well as 2,500 to 3,000 mL of fluid per day. Accuraterecords of intake, output, and client's weight shouldbe kept on a daily basis. Client/Family Education for Lithium The client should: Take medication on a regular basis, even when feel-ing well. Discontinuation can result in return ofsymptoms. Not drive or operate dangerous machinery untillithium levels are stabilized. Drowsiness and dizzi-ness can occur. Not skimp on dietary sodium intake. He or sheshould eat a variety of healthy foods and avoid\"junk\" foods. The client should drink 6 to 8 largeglasses of water each day and avoid excessive use ofbeverages containing caffeine (coffee, tea, colas),which promote increased urine output. Notify the physician if vomiting or diarrhea occurs.These symptoms can result in sodium loss and anincreased risk of lithium toxicity. Carry card or other identification noting that he orshe is taking lithium.514 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch26_498-527 23/07/14 12:32 PM Page 514CHAPTER 26 Bipolar and 515TABLE 26-3 Mood Stabilizing Agents CLASSIFICATION: PREGNANCY CATEGORY/ CONTRAINDICATIONS/ DAILY ADULT DOSAGE RANGE/ GENERIC (TRADE) HALF-LIFE/INDICATIONS MECHANISM OF ACTION PRECAUTIONS THERAPEUTIC PLASMA treatment ofmanic episodes of bipolar disorder Unlabeled uses: Neutropenia Cluster headaches (prophylaxis) Alcohol dependence Trigeminal neuralgia Unlabeled uses: Bipolar disorder Resistant schizophrenia Management of alcohol withdrawal Restless legs syndrome Postherpetic neuralgia D/ 18-60 hr/ Petit mal, akinetic, and myoclonic seizures Panic disorder Unlabeled uses: Acute manic episodes Uncontrolled leg movementsduring sleep Neuralgias D/ 5-20 hr/ Epilepsy Manic episodes Migraine prophylaxis Adjunct therapy in schizophreniaNot fully understood, but may modulate the effects of variousneurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, serotonin,dopamine, glutamate, andGABA, that are thought to playa role in the symptomatologyof bipolar disorder (may take1-3 weeks for symptoms tosubside).

Use information furnishedby health-care providers regarding methods of con-traception. Notify the physician as soon as possibleif pregnancy is suspected or planned. Be aware of side effects and symptoms associatedwith toxicity. Notify the physician if any of the fol-lowing symptoms occur: persistent nausea and vom-iting, severe diarrhea, ataxia, blurred vision, tinnitus,excessive output of urine, increasing tremors, ormental confusion. Refer to written materials furnished by health-careproviders while receiving self-administered main-tenance therapy. Keep appointments for outpa-tient follow-up; have serum lithium level checkedevery 1 to 2 months, or as advised by physician. Client/Family Education for Anticonvulsants The client should: Refrain from discontinuing the drug abruptly.Physician will administer orders for tapering thedrug when therapy is to be discontinued. Report the following symptoms to the physician immediately: skin rash, unusual bleeding, sponta-neous bruising, sore throat, fever, malaise, darkurine, and yellow skin or eyes. Not drive or operate dangerous machinery until reaction to the medication has been established. Avoid consuming alcoholic beverages and non-prescription medications without approval fromphysician. Carry card at all times identifying the name of med-ications being taken.CLINICAL PEARL The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires that all antiepileptic (anticonvulsant) drugs carry a warning labelindicating that use of the drugs increases risk for suicidal thoughtsand behaviors. Patients being treated with these medicationsshould be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depres-sion, suicidal thoughts or behavior, or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Client/Family Education for Calcium Channel Blocker The client should: Take medication with meals if gastrointestinal (GI) upset occurs. Use caution when driving or when operating dangerous machinery. Dizziness, drowsiness, andblurred vision can occur. Refrain from discontinuing the drug abruptly. Todo so may precipitate cardiovascular problems.Physician will administer orders for tapering thedrug when therapy is to be discontinued. Report occurrence of any of the following symp-toms to physician immediately: irregular heartbeat,shortness of breath, swelling of the hands and feet,pronounced dizziness, chest pain, profound moodswings, severe and persistent headache. Rise slowly from a sitting or lying position to pre-vent a sudden drop in blood pressure. Avoid taking other medications (including over-the-counter medications) without physician's approval. Carry card at all times describing medications beingtaken. Client/Family Education for Antipsychotics The client should: Use caution when driving or operating dangerousmachinery. Drowsiness and dizziness can occur.4092_Ch26_498-527 23/07/14 12:32 PM Page 521Refrain from discontinuing the drug abruptly after long-term use. To do so might produce withdrawalsymptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, gas-tritis, headache, tachycardia, insomnia, tremulous-ness. Physician will administer orders for taperingthe drug when therapy is to be discontinued. Use sunblock lotion and wear protective clothingwhen spending time outdoors. Skin is more suscep-tible to sunburn, which can occur in as little as 30 minutes. Report the occurrence of any of the following symp-toms to the physician immediately: sore throat,fever, malaise, unusual bleeding, easy bruising, per-sistent nausea and vomiting, severe headache, rapidheart rate, difficulty urinating, muscle twitching,tremors, darkly colored urine, excessive urination,excessive thirst, excessive hunger, weakness, palestools, yellow skin or eyes, muscular incoordination,or skin rash. Rise slowly from a sitting or lying position to pre-vent a sudden drop in blood pressure. Take frequent sips of water, chew sugarless gum, orsuck on hard candy, if dry mouth is a problem.Good oral care (frequent brushing, flossing) is veryimportant. Consult the physician regarding smoking while on antipsychotic therapy. Smoking increases themetabolism of these drugs, requiring an adjust-ment in dosage to achieve a therapeutic effect. Dress warmly in cold weather, and avoid extended exposure to very high or low temperatures. Body tem-perature is harder to maintain with this medication. Avoid drinking alcohol while on antipsychotic ther-apy. These drugs potentiate each other's effects. Avoid taking other medications (including over-the-counter products) without the physician's approval.Many medications contain substances that interactwith antipsychotic medications in a way that may beharmful. Be aware of possible risks of taking antipsychoticsduring pregnancy. Safe use during pregnancy hasnot been established. Antipsychotics are thought toreadily cross the placental barrier; if so, a fetus couldexperience adverse effects of the drug. Inform thephysician immediately if pregnancy occurs, is sus-pected, or is planned. Be aware of side effects of antipsychotic medica-tions. Refer to written materials furnished byhealth-care providers for safe self-administration. Continue to take the medication, even if feelingwell and as though it is not needed. Symptoms mayreturn if medication is discontinued. Carry a card or other identification at all times describing medications being taken.522 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation CASE STUDY AND SAMPLE CARE PLAN NURSING HISTORY AND ASSESSMENT Candace, age 32, recently moved to New York City from Omaha, Nebraska, where she had been working as a tele-vision reporter. She felt that Omaha had become \"too bor-ing\" and wanted to experience the big city life. Candacehas a history of Bipolar I Disorder, and has been maintainedon lithium since she was 23 years old. Since she arrived inNew York City, she has run out of her medication and hasnot found a doctor to have her prescription renewed. Shehas been staying in an inexpensive apartment, using hersavings to live on. She has been seeking employment inher chosen line of work, but it has been 2 months now,and she has been unable to find a job. She is becominganxious, because her savings are becoming depleted. Shehas lost weight and has trouble sleeping. Today, after two failed interviews, Candace went to a bar and began drinking. She ordered several rounds ofdrinks for everyone in the bar, and told the bartender to\"put it on my tab.\" The bartender called the police whenCandace refused to pay her tab and became loud and bel-ligerent. He said she began shouting that she knew themayor, and he was going to help her find a job, and if theydidn't leave her alone, she would tell the mayor how theywere treating her. She took out her cell phone and said shewas calling the mayor. When others in the room beganlaughing at her, she began cursing and saying that \"theywould be sorry one day that they laughed at her.\" When thepolice arrived, Candace was resistant and had to be physi-cally restrained. The police took Candace to the emergencydepartment of the community hospital, where she was ad-mitted with a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder, current episodemanic. The psychiatrist ordered olanzapine 10 mg IM STAT,olanzapine 10 mg PO qd, lithium carbonate 600 mg PObid, and vitamin supplement daily. He ordered lithium levelto be drawn prior to first dose of lithium. NURSING DIAGNOSES/OUTCOME IDENTIFICATION From the assessment data, the admitting nurse develops the following nursing diagnoses for Candace: 1.Risk for self- or other-directed violence impulsivity a. Short-Term Goal: Agitation and hyperactivity will be maintained at manageable level with the administration of tran-quilizing medication. 4092_Ch26_498-527 23/07/14 12:32 PM Page 522Summary and Key Points Bipolar disorder is manifested by mood swings from profound depression to extreme elation andeuphoria. Genetic influences have been strongly implicatedin the development of bipolar disorder. Variousother physiological factors, such as biochemicaland electrolyte alterations, as well as cerebral struc-tural changes, have been implicated. Side effectsof certain medications may also induce symptomsof mania. No single theory can explain the etiologyof bipolar disorder, and it is likely that the illness iscaused by a combination of factors. Symptoms of mania may be observed on a contin-uum of three phases, each identified by the degreeof severity: phase I, hypomania; phase II, acutemania; and phase III, delirious mania.The symptoms of bipolar disorder may occur inchildren and adolescents, as well as adults. Treatment of bipolar disorders includes individualtherapy, group and family therapy, cognitive therapy,electroconvulsive therapy, and psychopharmacology.For the majority of clients, the most effective treat-ment appears to be a combination of psychotropicmedication and psychosocial therapy. Some clinicians are choosing a course of therapybased on a model of recovery, somewhat like thatwhich has been used for many years with problemsof addiction. The basic premise of a recovery modelis empowerment of the individual. The recoverymodel is designed to allow individuals primary con-trol over decisions about their own care, and to en-able a person with a mental health problem to livea meaningful life in a community of choice whilestriving to achieve his or her full potential.CHAPTER 26 Bipolar and Related Disorders 523 C A S E S T U D Y A N D S A M P L E C A R E P L A N\u2014cont'd b. Long-Term Goal: Candace will not harm self or others during hos- pitalization. 2.Imbalanced nutrition: Less than body requirementsrelated to lack of appetite and excessive physical ag ita- tion, evidenced by loss of weight. a. Short-Term Goal: Candace will consume sufficient finger foods andbetween-meal snacks to meet recommendeddaily allowances of nutrients. b. Long-Term Goal: Candace will begin to regain weight and exhibit nosigns or symptoms of malnutrition. PLANNING/IMPLEMENTATION RISK FOR SELF- OR OTHER-DIRECTED VIOLENCE The following nursing interventions have been identifiedfor Candace: 1.Place Candace in a private room near the nurse's station. Observe her behavior frequently . 2.Remove all dangerous objects from her environ-ment. 3.Plan some physical activities for Candace (e.g., tread-mill, punching bag) and regular rest periods duringthe day . 4.Administer tranquilizing medication as ordered by physician. 5.Monitor lithium levels 3 times during first week of ther-apy. Monitor for signs and symptoms of toxicity (e.g., ata xia, blurred vision, severe diarrhea, persistent nausea and vomiting, tinnitus). 6.Ensure that sufficient staff is available to interveneshould Candace become ag itated and agg ressive.IMBALANCED NUTRITION: LESS THAN BODY REQUIREMENTS The following nursing interventions have been identified for Candace: 1.Consult dietitian to determine appropriate diet for Can- dace to restore nutrition and gain weight. Ensure that herdiet includes foods that she par ticularly likes. 2.Ensure that Candace has access to \"finger foods\" and between meal snacks if she cannot or will not sit still toeat off a meal tray . 3.Maintain an accurate record of intake, output, and caloriecount. 4.Obtain daily weights. 5.Administer vitamin supplement, as ordered by physician. 6.Sit with Candace during mealtime. EVALUATION The outcome criteria identified for Candace have been met.She has not harmed herself or others in any way. She is ableto verbalize names of resources outside the hospital fromwhom she may request help if needed. With help from thesocial worker, she has applied for unemployment assistance,and will begin receiving help within 2 weeks. She has gained3 pounds in the hospital, and verbalizes understanding ofthe importance of maintaining good nutrition. She is takingher medication regularly, and has a follow-up appointmentwith the psychiatric nurse practitioner who will see Candacebiweekly and ensure that Candace is compliant with med-ication and lab requirements. Candace verbalizes under-standing of the importance of taking her medication on acontinuous basis. She has a hopeful, but realistic, attitudeabout finding work in New York City, and states that she willgive herself a deadline, after which she plans to return to herhome in Omaha, where she may be near family and friends. 4092_Ch26_498-527 23/07/14 12:32 PM Page 523For many years, the pharmacological treatment of choice for bipolar mania was lithium carbonate. Anumber of other medications are now being usedwith satisfactory results, including anticonvulsantsand antipsychotics. There is a narrow margin between the therapeuticand toxic levels of lithium. Serum lithium levelsmust be monitored regularly while on mainte-nance therapy.524 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation Additional info available at www.davisplus.com Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

Factors associated with perceived burden, resourceful-ness, and quality of life in female family members of adults with serious mental illness. Journal of the American Psychiatric Association , 14(2), 125-135. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: About 10 to 17.5 million per- sons experience serious mental illness (SM I) each year . Most of their caregivers are female family members. Theauthors state, \"Caregiver burden is affected by disruptivebehaviors of the mentally ill person, changes in householdroutines, strained social relationships, lack of social support,deteriorating finances, diminished opportunity for leisure,exhaustion, and the stigma associated with mental illness,termed stigma by association\" (p. 125). Depression is not uncommon among caregivers, who are largely female. Thepurpose of this study was to examine the associations be-tween characteristics of female family members, adults withSMI, and the family situation and caregivers' burden, stigma,depressive cognitions, resourcefulness, and quality of life.The sample consisted of 60 female family members ofadults with SMI (i.e., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, majordepressive disorder, and anxiety disorders). Thirty were Caucasian and 30 were African American. Age range was Continued 4092_Ch26_498-527 23/07/14 12:32 PM Page 525References Allen, M.H. (2003). Approaches to the treatment of mania .

The majority of the women lived in the same household and provided care for their family members withmental illness. Most had some college education. RESULTS OF THE STUDY: Age and level of education were not associated with burden, stigma, depressive cognitions, resourcefulness, or quality of life. However , Caucasian women repor ted greater burden than did African American women. Perceived burden was inversely associated withlength of caregiving time, suggesting that women adaptover time to having a family member with mental illness.A greater burden and stigma by association was expressedby caregivers of adults with bipolar disorder than those withschizophrenia. Mothers of adults with SMI expressedgreater feelings of burden and stigma than other femalefamily members (e.g., sisters, daughters, wives). The au-thors suggest that this may be related to mothers' feelingsof being in some way responsible for the mental illness in their offspring. In-home caregivers expressed greater burden than out-of-home caregivers. The characteristics thatrelated to lowest personal resourcefulness of caregivers in-cluded Caucasian race, relationship of mother, younger ageof the individual with mental illness, and diagnosis of bipolardisorder. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: These findings have direct implications for psychiatric nursing of female careg i vers of family members with SMI. The authors suggest that teaching personal resourcefulness skills in asystematic way to women with newly diagnosed familymembers may be beneficial in maintaining their optimalquality of life. The population at highest risk was suggestedby this study to be Caucasian mothers of younger aged off-spring with bipolar disorder. The authors state, \"Thesewomen may benefit from programs that teach the cogni-tive-behavioral, self-help skills that constitute personal re-sourcefulness, because such skills have been associatedwith optimal quality of life\" (p. 133) TEST YOUR CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS Alice, age 29, had been working in the typing pool of a large cor- poration for 6 years. Her immediate supervisor recently retired andAlice was promoted to supervisor, in charge of 20 people in the de-partment. Alice was flattered by the promotion but anxious aboutthe additional responsibility of the position. Shortly after the pro-motion, she overheard two of her former coworkers saying, \"Whyin the world did they choose her? She's not the best one for thejob. I know I certainly won't be able to respect her as a boss!\" Hear- ing these comments added to Alice's anxiety and self-doubt. Shortly after Alice began her new duties, her friends and cowork- ers noticed a change. She had a great deal of energy and workedlong hours on her job. She began to speak very loudly and rapidly.Her roommate noticed that Alice slept very little, yet seldom appearedtired. Every night she would go out to bars and dances. Sometimesshe brought men she had just met home to the apartment, some-thing she had never done before. She bought lots of clothes andmakeup and had her hair restyled in a more youthful look. She failedto pay her share of the rent and bills but came home with a brandnew convertible. She lost her temper and screamed at her roommateto \"Mind your own business!\" when asked to pay her share. She became irritable at work, and several of her subordinates reported her behavior to the corporate manager. When the man-ager confronted Alice about her behavior, she lost control, shouting,cursing, and striking out at anyone and anything that happened tobe within her reach. The security officers restrained her and tookher to the emergency department of the hospital, where she was admitted to the psychiatric unit. She had no previous historyof psychiatric illness. The psychiatrist assigned a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder, and wrote orders for olanzapine (Zyprexa) 10 mg IM STAT, olanzapine15 mg PO daily, and lithium carbonate 600 mg qid. Answer the following questions related to Alice: 1.What are the most important considerations with which the nurse who is taking care of Alice should be concerned? 2.Why was Alice given the diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder? 3.The doctor should order a lithium level drawn after 4 to 6 days.For what symptoms should the nurse be on the aler t? 4.Why did the physician order olanzapine 23/07/14 12:32 J.F., & Bipolar depression: Long-term challenges for the clinician.

Nursing care is described in the context of thenursing process. Various treatment modalities are explored. Historical Aspects Individuals have experienced anxiety throughout the ages. Yet anxiety, like fear, was not clearly definedor isolated as a separate entity by psychiatrists or psy-chologists until the 19th and 20th centuries. In fact,what we now know as anxiety was once solely identi-fied by its physiological symptoms, focusing largely onthe cardiovascular system. Clinicians used a myriad of diagnostic terms in attempting to identify thesesymptoms. For example, cardiac neurosis, DaCosta'ssyndrome, irritable heart, and vasoregulatory asthenia are just a few of thenames under which anxiety has been concealed overthe years (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Freud first introduced the term anxiety neurosis in 1895. Freud wrote, \"I call this syndrome 'anxiety neu-rosis' because all its components can be groupedround the chief symptom of anxiety\" (Freud, 1959).This notion attempted to negate the previous conceptof the problem as strictly physical, although it wassome time before physicians of internal medicinewere ready to accept the psychological implicationsfor the symptoms. In fact, it was not until the yearsduring World War II that the psychological dimen-sions of these various functional heart conditionswere recognized. For many years, anxiety disorders were viewed as purely psychological or purely biological in nature.Researchers have begun to focus on the interrelated-ness of mind and body, and anxiety disorders providean excellent example of this complex relationship. Itis likely that various factors, including genetic, devel-opmental, environmental, and psychological, play arole in the etiology of anxiety disorders. Epidemiological Statistics Anxiety disorders are the most common of all psychi-atric illnesses and result in considerable functionalimpairment and distress (Hollander & Simeon,2008). Statistics vary widely, but most agree that anx-iety disorders are more common in women than inmen by at least 2 to 1. Prevalence rates for anxiety dis-orders within the general population have been givenat 3 to 5 percent for generalized anxiety disorder andpanic disorder, 13 percent for social anxiety disorder,and 25 percent for phobias. Obsessive-compulsive CHAPTER 27 Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive, and Related Disorders 529 CORE CONCEPT Anxiety Apprehension, tension, or uneasiness from anticipation of danger, the source of which is largely unknown or un-recognized. Anxiety may be regarded as pathologicalwhen it interferes with social and occupational function-ing, achievement of desired goals, or emotional comfort(Black & Andreasen, 2011, pp. 590-591) Individuals face anxiety on a daily basis. Anxiety, which provides the motivation for achievement, is a necessary force for survival. The term anxiety is often used interchangeably with the word stress; however, they are not the same. Stress, or more properly, a stres- sor, is an external pressure that is brought to bear onthe individual. Anxiety is the subjective emotional re-sponse to that stressor. (See Chapter 2 for an overviewof anxiety as a psychological response to stress.) Anxiety may be distinguished from fearin that the former is an emotional process, whereas fear is a cog-nitive one. Fear involves the intellectual appraisal ofa threatening stimulus; anxiety involves the emotionalresponse to that appraisal. This chapter focuses on disorders that are charac- terized by exaggerated and often disabling anxiety reactions. Historical aspects and epidemiological sta-tistics are presented. Predisposing factors that havebeen implicated in the etiology of the disorders pro-vide a framework for studying the dynamics of phobias,obsessive-compulsive disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and other anxiety disorders.Various theories of causation are presented, althoughit is most likely that a combination of factors contributeto the etiology of these disorders. The neurobiology ofanxiety disorders is presented in Figure 27-1.4092_Ch27_528-558 24/07/14 5:30 PM Page 529530 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in have also been implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders, disturbances in seroton in, norepinephrine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) appear to be most significant. Cell bodies of origin for the serotonin pathways lie within the raphe nuclei located in the brain stem. Serotonin is thought to be de- creased in anxiety disorders. Cell bodies for norepinephrine originate in the locus ceruleus. Norepinephrine is thought to be i ncreased in anxiety disorders. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. It is involved in the reduction and slowing of cellular activity. It is synthesized from glutamic acid, with vitamin B6as a cofactor. It is found in almost every region of the brain. GABA is thought to be decreased in anxiety disorders (allowing for increased cellular excitability). AREAS OF THE BRAIN AFFECTED Areas of the brain affected by anxiety disorders and the symptoms that they mediate include the following:\u0081 Amygdala: Fear; particularly important in panic and phobic disorders\u0081 memory serotonin stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors CNS depression. produces and cardiovascular agonist of withdr awal Nausea, diarrhea, headache, insomnia,somnolence, sexual dysfunction Headache, dr y mouth, nausea, somnolence, dizziness, insomnia, asthenia, constipation, diarrhea Propranolol: disorders.4092_Ch27_528-558 24/07/14 5:30 PM Page 530disorders account for 2 to 3 percent (Rowney, Hermida, & Malone, 2010). A review of the literature revealed a wide range of reports regarding the preva-lence of anxiety disorders in children (2 percent to43 percent). Epidemiological studies suggest that thesymptoms are more prevalent among girls than boys,and that minority children and children from low socioeconomic environments may be at greater risk forall emotional illness (National Mental Health Associa-tion [NMHA], 2005). Studies of familial patterns sug-gest that a familial predisposition to anxiety disordersprobably exists. How Much Is Too Much? Anxiety is usually considered a normal reaction to arealistic danger or threat to biological integrity or self-concept. Normal anxiety dissipates when the dangeror threat is no longer present. It is difficult to draw a precise line between normal and abnormal anxiety. Normality is determined by societal standards; what is considered normal inChicago, Illinois, may not be considered so in Cairo,Egypt. There may even be regional differences withina country or cultural differences within a region. Sowhat criteria can be used to determine if an individ-ual's anxious response is normal? Anxiety can be con-sidered abnormal or pathological if: 1.It is out of proportion to the situation that is creating it. EXAMPLE Mrs. K. witnessed a serious automobile accident 4 weeks ago when she was out driving in her car, and since that time refuses to drive even to the grocery store a few miles fromher house. When he is available, her husband must take herwherever she needs to go. 2.The anxiety interferes with social, occupational, or other important ar eas of functioning. EXAMPLE Because of the anxiety associated with driving her car, Mrs. K. has been forced to quit her job in a downtown bank for lackof transportation. Application of the Nursing Process\u2014 Assessment Panic Disorder Background Assessment Data Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent panic at- tacks, the onset of which is unpredictable, and mani- fested by intense apprehension, fear, or terror, oftenassociated with feelings of impending doom and accom-panied by intense physical discomfort. The symptomsCHAPTER 27 Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive, and Related Disorders 531 IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE Johnson, J.G., Cohen, P., Pine, D.S., Klein, D.F., Kasen, S., & Brook, J.S. (2000, November 8). Association betweencigarette smoking and anxiety disorders during adoles-cence and early adulthood. Journal of the AmericanMedical Association, 284 (18), 2348-2351. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: The main objective of this study was to investigate the long itudinal association between ciga- rette smoking and anxiety disorders among adolescents and young adults. The study sample included 688 teenagers(51 percent female and 49 percent male) from upstate NewYork. The youths were interviewed at a mean age of 16 years,during the years 1985 to 1986, and again at a mean age of22 years, during the years 1991 to 1993. At age 16, 6 percentof the participants smoked 20 or more cigarettes a day. Thenumber increased to 15 percent by age 22. RESULTS OF THE STUDY: Of the participants who smoked 20 cigarettes or more a day during adolescence, a significantnumber developed an anxiety disorder during young adult- hood: 20.5 percent developed generalized anxiety disorder,10.3 percent developed agoraphobia, and 7.7 percent de-veloped panic disorder. According to the researchers, ciga-rette smoking does not appear to increase the risk ofdeveloping OCD or social anxiety disorder. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The results of this study present just one more reason why adolescents should be encouraged not to smoke or not to beg in smoking. The implications for nursing practice are serious. Nurses can ini- tiate and become involved in educational programs to dis-courage cigarette smoking. Many negative health concernsare related to smoking, and this study provides additionalinformation to include in educational programs designedspecifically for adolescents.CORE CONCEPT Panic A sudden overwhelming feeling of terror or impendingdoom. This most severe form of emotional anxiety is usually accompanied by behavioral, cognitive, andphysiological signs and symptoms considered to beoutside the expected range of normalcy. 4092_Ch27_528-558 24/07/14 5:30 PM Page 531come on unexpectedly; that is, they do not occur im- mediately before or on exposure to a situation thatusually causes anxiety (as in specific phobia). Theyare not triggered by situations in which the person isthe focus of others' attention (as in social anxiety dis-order). The role of organic factors in the etiology hasbeen ruled out. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013) states that at least four ofthe following symptoms must be present to identifythe presence of a panic attack. Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate Sweating Trembling or shaking Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering Feelings of choking Chest pain or discomfort Nausea or abdominal distress Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed, or faint Chills or heat sensations Paresthesias tingling sensations) Derealization (feelings of unreality) or deperson-alization (feelings of being detached from oneself) Fear of losing control or going crazy Fear of dying The attacks usually last minutes, or more rarely, hours. The individual often experiences varying degreesof nervousness and apprehension between attacks.Symptoms of depression are common. The average age of onset of panic disorder is the late 20s. Frequency and severity of the panic attacksvary widely. Some individuals may have attacks ofmoderate severity weekly; others may have less severeor limited-symptom attacks several times a week. Stillothers may experience panic attacks that are sepa-rated by weeks or months. The disorder may last fora few weeks or months or for a number of years.Sometimes the individual experiences periods of remission and exacerbation. In times of remission,the person may have recurrent limited-symptom at-tacks. Panic disorder may or may not be accompaniedby agoraphobia (discussed later in the chapter). Generalized Anxiety Disorder Background Assessment Data Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by persistent, unrealistic, and excessive anxiety andworry, which have occurred more days than not for atleast 6 months, and cannot be attributed to specificorganic factors, such as caffeine intoxication or hyper-thyroidism. The symptoms cause clinically significantdistress or impairment in social, occupational, orother important areas of functioning. The anxiety andworry are associated with muscle tension, restlessness,or feeling keyed up or on edge (APA, 2013). The in-dividual often avoids activities or events that may resultin negative outcomes, or spends considerable timeand effort preparing for such activities. Anxiety andworry often result in procrastination in behavior or decision-making, and the individual repeatedly seeksreassurance from others. The disorder may begin in childhood or adoles- cence, but onset is not uncommon after age 20. Depres-sive symptoms are common, and numerous somaticcomplaints may also be a part of the clinical picture.GAD tends to be chronic, with frequent stress-relatedexacerbations and fluctuations in the course of the illness. Predisposing Factors to Panic and Generalized Anxiety Disorders Psychodynamic Theory The psychodynamic view focuses on the inability of the ego to intervene when conflict occurs betweenthe id and the superego, producing anxiety. For vari-ous reasons (unsatisfactory parent-child relationship;conditional love or provisional gratification), ego de-velopment is delayed. When developmental defectsin ego functions compromise the capacity to modu-late anxiety, the individual resorts to unconsciousmechanisms to resolve the conflict. Overuse or inef-fective use of ego defense mechanisms results in mal-adaptive responses to anxiety. Cognitive Theory The main thesis of the cognitive view is that faulty, distorted, or counterproductive thinking patterns accompany or precede maladaptive behaviors andemotional disorders (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Whenthere is a disturbance in this central mechanism ofcognition, there is a consequent disturbance in feel-ing and behavior. Because of distorted thinking, anx-iety is maintained by erroneous or dysfunctionalappraisal of a situation. There is a loss of ability to rea-son regarding the problem, whether it is physical orinterpersonal. The individual feels vulnerable in agiven situation, and the distorted thinking results inan irrational appraisal, fostering a negative outcome. Biological Aspects Research investigations into the psychobiological cor-relation of panic and generalized anxiety disordershave implicated a number of possibilities. Genetics Panic disorder has a strong genetic element (Harvard Medical School, 2006). The concordance rate for identical twins is 30 percent, and the risk forthe disorder in a close relative is 10 to 20 percent.Hollander and Simeon (2008) report on researchfindings of an association between panic disorder anda variant of the gene that controls the manufacture532 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch27_528-558 24/07/14 5:30 PM Page 532of the protein cholecystokinin, which has been known to induce panic attacks when it is injected. Neuroanatomical Modern theory on the physiology of emotional states places the key in the lower brain cen- ters, including the limbic system, the diencephalon(thalamus and hypothalamus), and the reticular for- mation. Structural brain imaging studies in patientswith panic disorder have implicated pathological involvement in the temporal lobes, particularly thehippocampus (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Biochemical Abnormal elevations of blood lactate have been noted in clients with panic disorder. Like- wise, infusion of sodium lactate into clients with anx- iety neuroses produced symptoms of panic disorder . Although several laboratories have replicated thesefindings of increased lactate sensitivity in panic-proneindividuals, no specific mechanism that triggers the panic symptoms can be explained (Hollander &Simeon, 2008). Neurochemical Stronger evidence exists for the in- volvement of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine in the etiology of panic disorder. Norepinephrine is known to mediate arousal, and it causes hyperarousaland anxiety . This fact has been demonstrated by a no- table increase in anxiety following the administrationof drugs that increase the synaptic availability of nor-epinephrine, such as yohimbine. The neurotransmit-ters serotonin and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)Phobias Agoraphobia Background Assessment Data The literal Greek translation of the word agoraphobia is \"fear of the marketplace.\" This defines the fear that some patients have of being in open shops andmarkets, although \"their true fear is being separatedfrom a source of security\" (Black & Andreasen, 2011, p. 171). The individual experiences fear of being in places or situations from which escape might bedifficult or in which help might not be available in theevent that panic symptoms should occur. It is possiblethat the individual may have experienced the symp-tom(s) in the past and is preoccupied with fears oftheir recurrence. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for agoraphobia are presented in Box 27-1.CHAPTER 27 Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive, and Related Disorders 533 CORE CONCEPT Phobia Fear cued by the presence or anticipation of a specific ob- ject or situation, exposure to which almost invariably pro- vokes an immediate anxiety response or panic attack even though the subject recognizes that the fear is excessive orunreasonable. The phobic stimulus is avoided or enduredwith marked distress (Shahrokh & Hales, 2003). are thought to be decreased in anxiety disorders (Harvard Medical School, 2006). BOX 27-1 Diagnostic Criteria for Agoraphobia A. Marked fear or anxiety about two (or more) of the follow- ing five situations: 1. Using public transportation (e.g., automobiles, buses, trains, ships, planes) 2. Being in open spaces (e.g., parking lots, marketplaces, bridges) 3. Being in enclosed places (e.g., shops, theaters, cinemas) 4. Standing in line or being in a crowd 5. Being outside of the home alone B. The individual fears these situations because of thoughts that escape might be difficult or help might not be availablein the event of panic-like symptoms or other incapacitatingor embarrassing symptoms (e.g., fear of falling in the elderly, fear of incontinence). C. The agoraphobic situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety. D. The agoraphobic situations are actively avoided, require the presence of a companion, or are endured with intensefear or anxiety. E. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the agoraphobic situations and to thesociocultural context.F. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting 6 months or more. G. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. H. If another medical condition (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson's disease) is present, the fear, anxiety,or avoidance is clearly excessive. I. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder\u2014for example,the symptoms are not confined to specific phobia, situa-tional type; do not involve only social situations (as in social anxiety disorder); and are not related exclusively to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disorder), per-ceived defects or flaws in physical appearance (as in bodydysmorphic disorder), reminders of traumatic events (as in posttraumatic stress disorder), or fear of separation(as in separation anxiety disorder).

Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (e.g., havinga conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being ob-served (e.g., eating or drinking), and performing in frontof others (e.g., giving a speech). Note: In children, the anx- iety must occur in peer settings and not just during inter-actions with adults. B. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated(i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to re-jection or offend others). C. The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety. Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing tospeak in social situations. D. The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety. E. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context.F.

American Psychiatric Association.Onset of symptoms most commonly occurs in the 20s and 30s and persists for many years. It is diag- nosed more commonly in women than in men. Impairment can be severe. In extreme cases the indi-vidual is unable to leave his or her home withoutbeing accompanied by a friend or relative. If this isnot possible the person may become totally confinedto his or her home. Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) Background Assessment Data Social anxiety disorder is an excessive fear of situa- tions in which a person might do something embar-rassing or be evaluated negatively by others. Theindividual has extreme concerns about being exposedto possible scrutiny by others and fears social or per-formance situations in which embarrassment mayoccur (APA, 2013). In some instances, the fear maybe quite defined, such as the fear of speaking or eat-ing in a public place, fear of using a public restroom,or fear of writing in the presence of others. In othercases, the social phobia may involve general social sit-uations, such as saying things or answering questionsin a manner that would provoke laughter on the partof others. Exposure to the phobic situation usually results in feelings of panic anxiety, with sweating,tachycardia, and dyspnea. Onset of symptoms of this disorder often begins in late childhood or early adolescence and runs a chronic,sometimes lifelong, course. It appears to be more common in women than in men (Puri & Treasaden,2011). Impairment interferes with social or occupationalfunctioning, or causes marked distress. The DSM-5 diag- nostic criteria for social anxiety disorder are presentedin Box 27-2. Specific Phobia Background Assessment Data Specific phobia is identified by fear of specific objects or situations that could conceivably cause harm (e.g.,snakes, heights), but the person's reaction to them isexcessive, unreasonable, and inappropriate. Specific phobias are often identified when other anxiety disorders have become a focus of clinical at-tention. Treatment is generally aimed at the primarydiagnosis because it usually produces the greatest dis-tress and interferes with functioning more so thandoes a specific phobia. A diagnosis of specific phobiais made only when the irrational fear restricts the individual's activities and interferes with his or herdaily living. The phobic person may be no more (or less) anx- ious than anyone else until exposed to the phobic object or situation. Exposure to the phobic stimulusproduces overwhelming symptoms of panic, includ-ing palpitations, sweating, dizziness, and difficultybreathing. In fact, these symptoms may occur in re-sponse to the individual's merely thinking about the4092_Ch27_528-558 24/07/14 5:30 PM Page 534phobic stimulus. Invariably the person recognizes that his or her fear is excessive or unreasonable, butis powerless to change, even though the individualmay occasionally endure the phobic stimulus whenexperiencing intense anxiety. Phobias may begin at almost any age. Those that begin in childhood often disappear without treat-ment, but those that begin or persist into adulthoodusually require assistance with therapy. The disorderis diagnosed more often in women than in men. Even though the disorder is relatively common among the general population, people seldom seektreatment unless the phobia interferes with ability tofunction. Obviously the individual who has a fear ofsnakes, but who lives on the 23rd floor of an urban,high-rise apartment building, is not likely to be both-ered by the phobia unless he or she decides to moveto an area where snakes are prevalent. On the otherhand, a fear of elevators may very well interfere withthis individual's daily functioning. Specific phobias have been classified according to the phobic stimulus. A list of some of the more com-mon ones appears in Table 27-1. This list is by nomeans all-inclusive. People can become phobic aboutalmost any object or situation, and anyone with a littleknowledge of Greek or Latin can produce a phobiaclassification, thereby making possibilities for the listalmost infinite. Predisposing Factors to Phobias The cause of phobias is unknown. However, varioustheories exist that may offer insight into the etiology. Psychoanalytic Theory Freud believed that phobias developed when a childexperiences normal incestuous feelings toward theopposite-gender parent (Oedipal/Electra complex)and fears aggression from the same-gender parent(castration anxiety). To protect themselves, these chil-dren repress this fear of hostility from the same-gender parent, and displace it onto something safer and more neutral, which becomes the phobic stimulus. Thephobic stimulus becomes the symbol for the parent,but the child does not realize this. Modern-day psychoanalysts believe in the same concept of phobic development, but believe that cas-tration anxiety is not the sole source of phobias. Theybelieve that other unconscious fears may also be ex-pressed in a symbolic manner as phobias. For exam-ple, a female child who was sexually abused by anadult male family friend when he was taking her for aride in his boat grew up with an intense, irrationalfear of all water vessels. Psychoanalytic theory postu-lates that fear of the man was repressed and displacedonto boats. Boats became an unconscious symbol forthe feared person, but one that the young girl viewedCHAPTER 27 Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive, and Related Disorders 535 TABLE 27-1 Classifications of Specific Phobias CLASSIFICATION FEAR AcrophobiaAilurophobiaAlgophobiaAnthophobiaAnthropophobiaAquaphobiaArachnophobiaAstraphobiaBelonephobiaBrontophobiaClaustrophobiaCynophobiaDementophobiaEquinophobiaGamophobiaHerpetophobiaHomophobiaMurophobiaMysophobiaNumerophobiaNyctophobiaOchophobiaOphidiophobiaPyrophobiaScoleciphobiaSiderodromophobiaT number 13StrangersAnimals4092_Ch27_528-558 24/07/14 5:30 PM Page 535as safer since her fear of boats prevented her from having to confront the real fear. Learning Theory Classic conditioning in the case of phobias may be explained as follows: a stressful stimulus produces an\"unconditioned\" response of fear. When the stressfulstimulus is repeatedly paired with a harmless object,eventually the harmless object alone produces a \"con-ditioned\" response: fear. This becomes a phobia whenthe individual consciously avoids the harmless objectto escape fear. Some learning theorists hold that fears are condi- tioned responses and, thus, they are learned by impos-ing rewards for certain behaviors. In the instance ofphobias, when the individual avoids the phobic object,he or she escapes fear, which is indeed a powerful reward. Phobias also may be acquired by direct learning or imitation (modeling) (e.g., a mother who exhibits feartoward an object will provide a model for the child,who may also develop a phobia of the same object). Cognitive Theory Cognitive theorists espouse that anxiety is the productof faulty cognitions or anxiety-inducing self-instructions.Two types of faulty thinking have been investigated:negative self-statements and irrational beliefs. Cognitivetheorists believe that some individuals engage in nega-tive and irrational thinking that produces anxiety reac-tions. The individual begins to seek out avoidancebehaviors to prevent the anxiety reactions, and phobiasresult. Somewhat related to the cognitive theory is the involvement of locus of control. Johnson and Sarason(1978) suggested that individuals with internal locusof control and those with external locus of controlmight respond differently to life change. These re-searchers proposed that locus of control orientationmay be an important variable in the development ofphobias. Individuals with an external control orienta-tion experiencing anxiety attacks in a stressful periodare likely to mislabel the anxiety and attribute it to external sources (e.g., crowded areas) or to a disease(e.g., heart attack). They may perceive the experiencedanxiety as being outside of their control. Figure 27-2depicts a graphic model of the relationship betweenlocus of control and the development of phobias. Biological Aspects Temperament Children experience fears as a part of normal development. Most infants are afraid of loudnoises. Common fears of toddlers and preschoolers in-clude strangers, animals, darkness, and fears of beingseparated from parents or attachment figures. Duringthe school-age years, there is fear of death and anxietyabout school achievement. Fears of social rejection andsexual anxieties are common among adolescents. Innate fears represent a part of the overall charac- teristics or tendencies with which one is born that in-fluence how he or she responds throughout life tospecific situations. Innate fears usually do not reachphobic intensity but may have the capacity for suchdevelopment if reinforced by events in later life. Forexample, a 4-year-old girl is afraid of dogs. By age 5, however , she has overcome her fear and plays with her own dog and the neighbors' dogs without fear.Then, when she is 19, she is bitten by a stray dog anddevelops a phobia of dogs. Life Experiences Certain early experiences may set the stage for phobicreactions later in life. Some researchers believe thatphobias, particularly specific phobias, are symbolic oforiginal anxiety-producing objects or situations thathave been repressed. Examples include: A child who is punished by being locked in a closetdevelops a phobia for elevators or other closedplaces. A child who falls down a flight of stairs develops aphobia for high places. A young woman who, as a child, survived a planecrash in which both her parents were killed has aphobia of airplanes.

A number of medical con-ditions have been associated with the development ofanxiety symptoms. Some of these include cardiac con-ditions, such as infarction, congestive hypo- or hyperthyroidism, andpheochromocytoma; respiratory conditions, such aschronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hyperventi-lation; and neurological conditions, such as complexpartial seizures, neoplasms, and encephalitis. Nursing care of clients with this disorder must take into consideration the underlying cause of the anxi-ety. Holistic nursing care is essential to ensure that theclient's physiological and psychosocial needs are met.Nursing actions appropriate for the specific medicalcondition must be considered. The diagnosis of substance-induced anxiety disorder is made only if the anxiety symptoms are in excess ofthose usually associated with the intoxication or with-drawal syndrome and warrant independent clinical attention. Evidence of intoxication or withdrawal mustbe available from history, physical examination, orlaboratory findings to substantiate the diagnosis. Sub-stance-induced anxiety disorder may be associated withuse of the following substances: alcohol, amphetamines,cocaine, hallucinogen, sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics,caffeine, cannabis, or other (APA, 2013).Nursing care of the client with substance-induced anx-iety disorder must take into consideration the nature ofthe substance and the context in which the symptomsoccur\u2014that is, intoxication or withdrawal.Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Background Assessment Data The manifestations of obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD) include the presence of obsessions, compul-sions, or both, the severity of which is significant enoughto cause distress or impairment in social, occupational,or other important areas of functioning (APA, 2013).The individual recognizes that the behavior is excessiveor unreasonable but, because of the feeling of relieffrom discomfort that it promotes, is compelled to continue the act. Common compulsions include hand washing, ordering, checking, praying, counting, and repeating words silently (APA, 2013). The disorder is equally common among men and women. It may begin in childhood, but more oftenbegins in adolescence or early adulthood. The courseis usually chronic, and may be complicated by depres-sion or substance abuse. Single people are affected byOCD more often than are married people (Sadock &Sadock, 2007). The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for OCD are presented in Box 27-3. Body Dysmorphic Disorder Background Assessment Data Body dysmorphic disorder is characterized by the ex- aggerated belief that the body is deformed or defectivein some specific way. The most common complaints in-volve imagined or slight flaws of the face or head, suchas wrinkles or scars, the shape of the nose, excessive facial hair, and facial asymmetry (Puri & Treasaden,2011). Other complaints may have to do with some aspect of the ears, eyes, mouth, lips, or teeth. Someclients may present with complaints involving otherparts of the body, and in some instances a true defectis present. The significance of the defect is unrealisti-cally exaggerated, however, and the person's concernis grossly excessive. Symptoms of depression and characteristics associated with obsessive-compulsive personality arecommon in individuals with body dysmorphic disor-der. Social and occupational impairment may occurbecause of the excessive anxiety experienced by theindividual in relation to the imagined defect. The per-son's medical history may reflect numerous visits toplastic surgeons and dermatologists in an unrelentingdrive to correct the imagined defect. He or she mayundergo unnecessary surgical procedures toward thiseffort. This disorder has been closely associated with delu- sional thinking, and the condition must be differen-tiated a patient has a delusional belief that a body part is grossly CORE CONCEPT Obsessions Recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses, or imagesexperienced as intrusive and stressful. Recognized asbeing excessive and unreasonable even though theyare a product of one's mind. The thought, impulse, orimage cannot be expunged by logic or reasoning (Black& Andreasen, 2011, p. 611). CORE CONCEPT Compulsions Repetitive ritualistic behavior or thoughts, the purpose of which is to prevent or reduce distress or to preventsome dreaded event or situation. The person feelsdriven to perform such actions in response to an ob-session or according to rules that must be appliedrigidly, even though the behaviors or thoughts are rec-ognized to be excessive or unreasonable (Black & Andreasen, 2011, p. 596). 4092_Ch27_528-558 24/07/14 5:30 PM Page 537deformed and distorted. In Body Dysmorphic Disorder, the patient is not delusional and is able toacknowledge that his or her concerns are exagger-ated. (p. 221) Traits associated with schizoid, obsessive-compulsive, and narcissistic personality disorders are not uncom- mon (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). The DSM- 5diagnostic disorder are presented inBox 27-4. Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder) Background Assessment Data The DSM-5 defines trichotillomania as the recurrent pulling out of one's hair that results in hair loss (APA,2013). The impulse is preceded by an increasing senseof tension and results in a sense of release or gratifica-tion from pulling out the hair. The most common sitesfor hair pulling are the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashesbut may occur in any area of the body on which hairgrows. These areas of hair loss are often found on theopposite side of the body from the dominant hand.Pain is seldom reported to accompany the hair pulling,although tingling and pruritus in the area are not uncommon. Comorbid psychiatric disorders are common with hair-pulling disorder. Some of these include mood dis-orders, eating disorders, anxiety disorders, substanceabuse disorders, and personality disorders\u2014most com-monly histrionic, borderline, and obsessive-compulsive(Hollander & Simeon, 2008). The disorder usually begins in childhood and may be accompanied by nail biting, head banging, scratching,biting, or other acts of self-mutilation. This relatively rarephenomenon occurs more often in women than inmen. Studies indicate that it affects 1 to 4 percent of adolescents and college students (Black & Andreasen,2011). Hoarding Disorder Background Assessment Data The DSM-5 defines the essential feature of hoarding disorder as \"persistent difficulties discarding or parting538 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation BOX 27-3 Diagnostic Criteria for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder A. Presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both: Obsessions are defined by (1) and (2): 1. Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced, at some time during the distur- bance, as intrusive and unwanted, and that in most in-dividuals cause marked anxiety or distress. 2. The individual attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, urges, or images, or to neutralize them withsome other thought or action (i.e., by performing acompulsion). Compulsions are defined by (1) and (2): 1. Repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts (e.g., praying, counting, re-peating words silently) that the person feels driven toperform in response to an obsession or according torules that must be applied rigidly. 2. The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety or distress, or preventing some dreadedevent or situation; however, these behaviors or mentalacts either are not connected in a realistic way with whatthey are designed to neutralize or prevent, or are clearlyexcessive. Note: Young children may not be able to articulate the aims of these behaviors or mental acts. B. The obsessions or compulsions are time-consuming (e.g., take more than 1 hour a day) or cause clinically significantdistress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.C. The obsessive-compulsive symptoms are not attributa- ble to the direct physiological effects of a substance(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medicalcondition. D. The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g., excessive worries, as ingeneralized anxiety disorder; preoccupation with appear-ance, as in body dysmorphic disorder; difficulty discardingor parting with possessions, as in eating disorders; preoccupation with sub-stances or gambling, as in substance-related and addictivedisorders; preoccupation with having an illness, as in ill-ness anxiety disorder; sexual urges or fantasies, as in para-philic disorders; impulses, as in disruptive, impulse-control,and conduct disorders; guilty ruminations, as in major depressive disorder; thought insertion or delusional pre-occupations, as in schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-chotic disorders; or repetitive patterns of behavior, as inautism spectrum disorder).

Additionally, the diagnosis may be spec-ified as \"with excessive acquisition,\" which identifiesthe excessive need for continual acquiring of items (either by buying them or by other means). In previouseditions of the DSM, hoarding was considered a symp-tom of OCD. However, in the DSM-5, it has been reclas-sified as a diagnostic disorder. Individuals with this disorder collect items until virtually all surfaces within the home are covered.There may be only narrow pathways, winding throughstacks of clutter, in which to walk. Some individualsalso hoard food and animals, keeping dozens or hun-dreds of pets, often in unsanitary conditions (TheMayo Clinic, 2011). Hoarding disorder affects an estimated 700,000 to 1.4 million Americans, but few receive adequatetreatment (Symonds & Janney, 2013). More menthan women are diagnosed with the disorder, and itis almost three times more prevalent in older adults(ages 55 to 94) compared with younger adults (ages34 to 44) (APA, 2013). The severity of the symptoms,regardless of when they begin, appears to becomemore severe with each decade of life. Associatedsymptoms include perfectionism, indecisiveness,anxiety, depression, distractibility, and difficultyplanning and organizing tasks (APA, 2013; Symonds& Janney, 2013). Treatment of hoarding disorder has been met with mixed results. It is often difficult to convince individ-uals with the disorder that they are actually ill. Changeis slow, and the relapse rate is high, with patients andfamily members showing various levels of understand-ing about their hoarding behaviors (Valente, 2009).Psychoeducation about the disorder is almost alwaysthe initial intervention, and treatment is most com-monly a combination of cognitive behavioral therapyand psychopharmacology with the selective serotoninreuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Predisposing Factors to Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders Psychoanalytic Theory Psychoanalytic theorists propose that individuals with OCD have weak, underdeveloped egos (for any of avariety of reasons: unsatisfactory parent-child relation-ship, conditional love, or provisional gratification).The psychoanalytical concept views clients with OCDas having regressed to earlier developmental stages ofthe infantile superego\u2014the harsh, exacting, punitivecharacteristics that now reappear as part of the psy-chopathology. Regression to the pre-Oedipal anal-sadistic phase, combined with use of specific egodefense mechanisms (isolation, undoing, displace-ment, reaction formation), produces the clinicalsymptoms of obsessions and compulsions (Sadock &Sadock, 2007). Aggressive impulses (common duringthe anal-sadistic developmental phase) are channeledinto thoughts and behaviors that prevent the feelingsof aggression from surfacing and producing intenseanxiety fraught with guilt (generated by the punitivesuperego). Learning Theory Learning theorists explain obsessive-compulsive be-havior as a conditioned response to a traumatic event.The traumatic event produces anxiety and discom-fort, and the individual learns to prevent the anxietyand discomfort by avoiding the situation with whichthey are associated. This type of learning is called pas- sive avoidance (staying away from the source). When passive avoidance is not possible, the individual learnsto engage in behaviors that provide relief from theanxiety and discomfort associated with the traumaticCHAPTER 27 Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive, and Related Disorders 539 BOX 27-4 Diagnostic Criteria for Body Dysmorphic Disorder A. Preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others. B. At some point during the course of the disorder, the indi- vidual has performed repetitive behaviors (e.g., mirrorchecking, excessive grooming, skin picking, reassuranceseeking) or mental acts (e.g., comparing his or her appear-ance with that of others) in response to the appearanceconcerns. C. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other importantareas of functioning.D. The appearance preoccupation is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual whose symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for an eatingdisorder.

American Psychiatric Association.4092_Ch27_528-558 24/07/14 5:30 PM Page 539situation. This type of learning is called active avoidance and describes the behavior pattern of the individual with OCD (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). According to this classic conditioning interpreta- tion, a traumatic event should mark the beginning ofthe obsessive-compulsive behaviors. However, in a sig-nificant number of cases, the onset of the behavior isgradual and the clients relate the onset of their prob-lems to life stress in general rather than to one ormore traumatic events. Psychosocial Influences The onset of trichotillomania can be related to stress-ful situations in more than one-quarter of cases. Addi-tional factors that have been implicated includedisturbances in mother-child relationship, fear ofabandonment, and recent object loss. Studies alsohave shown a possible correlation between trichotillo-mania and body dysmorphic disorder and a history ofchildhood abuse (e.g., physical, emotional, or sexual)or emotional neglect (Lochner et al., 2002; Phillips,2009). Biological Aspects Genetics Trichotillomania has commonly been associ- ated with obsessive-compulsive disorders among first-degree relatives, leading researchers to conclude thatthe disorder has a possible hereditary or familial pre- disposition. Structural abnormalities in various areasof the brain, as well as alterations in the serotonin andendogenous opioid systems, have also been noted. Genetics also may play a role in the development of hoarding disorder. Family and twin studies indicatethat approximately 50 percent of individuals whohoard report having a relative who also hoards (APA,2013). Neuroanatomy Recent findings suggest that neurobi- ological disturbances may play a role in the pathogen- esis and maintenance of OCD. Abnormalities invarious regions of the brain have been implicated inthe neurobiology of OCD. Functional neuroimagingtechniques and orbitofrontal cortex of individ-uals with the disorder (Hollander & Simeon, 2008).In individuals with hoarding disorder, neuroimaging studies have indicated less activity in the cingulate cor - tex, the area of the brain that connects the emotionalpart of the brain with the parts that control higher-level thinking (Saxena, 2013). Physiology Electrophysiological studies, sleep electroen- cephalogram studies, and neuroendocrine studies have suggested that there are commonalities between depressive disorders and OCD (Sadock & Sadock,2007). Neuroendocrine commonalities were suggestedin studies in about one-third of OCD clients shownonsuppression on the dexamethasone- suppression test and decreased growth hormone secretion with clonidine infusions. Biochemical Factors serotonin as influential in the etiology of obsessive-compulsive behaviors.Drugs that have been used successfully in alleviatingthe symptoms of OCD are clomipramine and theSSRIs, all of which are believed to block the neuronalreuptake of serotonin, thereby potentiating sero-toninergic activity in the central nervous system (see Figure 27-1). The serotonergic system may also be afactor in the etiology of body dysmorphic disorder . This can be reflected in a high incidence of comor-bidity with major mood disorder and anxiety disor-der and the positive responsiveness of the conditionto the serotonin-specific drugs. Transactional Model of Stress/Adaptation Anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and related disorders aremost likely caused by multiple factors. In Figure 27-3, agraphic depiction of this theory of multiple causationis presented in the Transactional Model of Stress/Adaptation. Assessment Scales A number of assessment rating scales are available formeasuring severity of anxiety symptoms. Some aremeant to be clinician administered, whereas othersmay be self-administered. Examples of self-ratingscales include the Beck Anxiety Inventory and theZung Self-Rated Anxiety Scale. One of the mostwidely used clinician-administered scales is the Hamil-ton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), which is used inboth clinical and research settings. The scale consistsof 14 items and measures both psychic and somaticanxiety symptoms (psychological distress and physicalcomplaints associated with anxiety). A copy of theHAM-A is presented in Box 27-5. Diagnosis/Outcome Identification Nursing diagnoses are formulated from the data gath-ered during the assessment phase and with back-ground knowledge regarding predisposing factors tothe disorder. Table 27-2 presents a list of client behav-iors and the NANDA International (NANDA-I) nurs-ing diagnoses that correspond to those behaviors,which may be used in planning care for clients withanxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and related disorders. Outcome Criteria The following criteria may be used for measurementof outcomes in the care of the client with anxiety disorders.540 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch27_528-558 24/07/14 5:30 PM Page 540CHAPTER 27 Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive, and Related Disorders 541 Cognitive Appraisal * Primary * (Real or perceived threat to biological integrity or self-concept) * Secondary * Because of weak ego strength, patient is unable to use coping mechanisms effectively.

In case management models, theplan of care may take the form of a critical pathway. Anxiety (Panic) Anxiety is defined as a \"vague uneasy feeling of discom- fort or dread accompanied by an autonomic response(the source often nonspecific or unknown to the in-dividual); a feeling of apprehension caused by antici-pation of danger. It is an alerting signal that warns ofimpending danger and enables the individual to takemeasures to deal with threat\" (NANDA International[NANDA-I], 2012, p. 344).

In an intensely anxious situation, the client is unable to comprehend anything but themost elementary communication. Hyperventilation may occur during periods of ex-treme anxiety. Hyperventilation causes the amountof carbon dioxide (CO 2) in the blood to decrease, possibly resulting in light-headedness, rapid heartrate, shortness of breath, numbness or tingling inthe hands or feet, and syncope. If hyperventilationoccurs, assist the client to breathe into a smallpaper bag held over the mouth and nose. Six to 12 natural breaths should be taken, alternatingwith short periods of diaphragmatic breathing. Thistechnique should not be used with clients who havecoronary or respiratory disorders, such as coronaryartery disease, asthma, or chronic obstructive pul-monary disease. Keep the immediate surroundings low in stimuli(dim lighting, few people, simple decor). A stimulat-ing environment may increase the level of anxiety. Administer tranquilizing medication, as ordered bythe physician. Assess the medication for effective-ness and for adverse side effects. When the level of anxiety has been reduced, explore with the client possible reasons for its occurrence. If the client is going to learn to inter-rupt escalating anxiety, he or she must first learnto recognize the factors that precipitate its onset. Teach the client the signs and symptoms of escalat-ing anxiety. Discuss ways to interrupt its progression,such as relaxation techniques, deep-breathing exer-cises, physical exercises, brisk walks, jogging, andmeditation. The client will determine which methodis most appropriate for him or her. Relaxation tech-niques result in a physiological response oppositethat of the anxiety response, and physical activitiesdischarge excess energy in a healthful manner. Fear Fearis defined as the \"response to perceived threat that is consciously recognized as a danger\" (NANDA-I,2012, p. 361). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal Client will discuss the phobic object or situation withthe health-care provider within (time specified). Long-Term Goal By time of discharge from treatment, client will be able to function in the presence of the phobicobject or situation without experiencing panic anxiety. Interventions Explore the client's perception of threat to physicalintegrity or threat to self-concept. Reassure theclient of his or her safety and security. It is impor-tant to understand the client's perception of thephobic object or situation in order to assist with thedesensitization process. Discuss the reality of the situation with the client inorder to recognize aspects that can be changed andthose that cannot. The client must accept the realityof the situation (aspects that cannot change) beforethe work of reducing the fear can progress. For example, a man who has a fear of flying and whoseemployment position requires long-distance airtravel must accept that he needs to conquer the fearof flying if he is going to stay in this particular job. Include the client in making decisions related tothe selection of alternative coping strategies. Forexample, the client may choose either to avoid thephobic stimulus or attempt to eliminate the fear as-sociated with it. Encouraging the client to makechoices promotes feelings of empowerment andserves to increase feelings of self-worth. If the client elects to work on elimination of thefear, the techniques of systematic desensitization orimplosion therapy may be employed. (See the ex-planation of these techniques under \"TreatmentModalities\" at the end of this chapter.) Systematicdesensitization is a plan of behavior modification,designed to expose the individual gradually to thesituation or object (either in reality or through fantasizing) until the fear is no longer experienced.With implosion therapy the individual is \"flooded\"with stimuli related to the phobic situation or ob-ject (rather than in gradual steps) until anxiety as-sociated with the object or situation is no longerexperienced. Fear is decreased as the physical andpsychological sensations diminish in response torepeated exposure to the phobic stimulus undernonthreatening conditions. Encourage the client to explore underlying feel-ings that may be contributing to irrational fears,and to face them rather than suppress them. Ex-ploring underlying feelings may help the client toconfront unresolved conflicts and develop moreadaptive coping abilities. Ineffective Coping Ineffective coping is defined as the \"inability to form a valid appraisal of the stressors, inadequate choices ofpracticed responses, and/or inability to use availableresources\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 348).CHAPTER 27 Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive, and Related Disorders 5454092_Ch27_528-558 24/07/14 5:30 PM Page 545Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals. Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal Within 1 week, the client will decrease participa-tion in ritualistic behavior by half. Long-Term Goal By the time of discharge from treatment, the clientwill demonstrate the ability to cope effectively with-out resorting to obsessive-compulsive behaviors orincreased dependency. Interventions Work with the client to determine the types of sit-uations that increase anxiety and result in ritualisticbehaviors. If the client is going to learn to interruptescalating anxiety, he or she must first learn to rec-ognize the factors that precipitate its onset. Initially meet the client's dependency needs as required. To suddenly and completely eliminate all avenues for dependency would create intenseanxiety on the part of the client. Encourage inde-pendence and give positive reinforcement for independent behaviors. Positive reinforcement en-hances self-esteem and may encourage repetition ofthe desired behaviors. In the beginning of treatment, allow plenty of timefor rituals. Do not be judgmental or verbalize dis-approval of the behavior. To deny the client this activity may precipitate panic level of anxiety. Support the client's efforts to explore the meaningand purpose of the behavior. He or she is mostlikely unaware of the relationship between emo-tional problems and compulsive behaviors. Knowl-edge and recognition of this fact is importantbefore change can occur. Provide a structured schedule of activities for theclient, including adequate time for the completionof rituals. The anxious individual needs a greatdeal of structure in his or her life. Assistance isneeded with decision making, and structure pro-vides a sense of security and comfort to deal withactivities of daily living. Gradually begin to limit the amount of time allot-ted for ritualistic behavior as the client becomesmore involved in other activities. Anxiety is mini-mized when the client is able to replace ritualisticbehaviors with more adaptive ones. Give positivereinforcement for nonritualistic behaviors. Help the client learn ways of interrupting obsessivethoughts and ritualistic behavior with techniquessuch as thought stopping (see Chapter 14), relaxationtechniques (see Relaxation Therapy chapter onlineat www.DavisPlus.com), physical exercise, or otherconstructive activity with which client feels comfort-able. Knowledge and practice of coping techniquesthat are more adaptive will help the client change andlet go of maladaptive responses to anxiety. Disturbed Body Image Disturbed body image is defined as the \"confusion inmental picture of one's physical self\" (NANDA-I,2012, p. 291). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal Client will verbalize understanding that perceptionsof changes in bodily structure or function are exag-gerated out of proportion to the change that actuallyexists. (Time frame for this goal must be determinedaccording to individual client's situation.) Long-Term Goal Client will verbalize perception of own body that isrealistic to actual structure or function by time ofdischarge from treatment. Interventions Assess client's perception of his or her body image.Keep in mind that this image is real to the client.Assessment information is necessary in developingan accurate plan of care. Denial of the client's feel-ings impedes the development of a trusting, thera-peutic relationship. Help client to see that his or her body image is distorted or that it is out of proportion in relationto the significance of an actual physical anomaly.Recognition that a misperception exists is neces-sary before the client can accept reality and reducethe significance of the imagined defect. Encourage verbalization of fears and anxieties associated with identified stressful life situations.Discuss alternative adaptive coping strategies. Ver-balization of feelings with a trusted individual mayhelp the client come to terms with unresolved is-sues. Knowledge of alternative coping strategiesmay help the client respond to stress more adap-tively in the future. Involve client in activities that reinforce a positivesense of self not based on appearance. When theclient is able to develop self-satisfaction based onaccomplishments and unconditional acceptance,significance of the imagined defect or minor phys-ical anomaly will diminish. Make referrals to support groups of individualswith similar histories (e.g., Adult Children of Alcoholics [ACOA], Victims of Incest, Survivors ofSuicide [SOS], Adults Abused as Children).546 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch27_528-558 24/07/14 5:30 PM Page 546Ineffective Impulse Control Ineffective impulse control is defined as \"a pattern of performing rapid, unplanned reactions to internal or external stimuli without regard for the negative con-sequences of these reactions to the impulsive individ-ual or to others\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 269). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal Client will verbalize adaptive ways to cope with stressby means other than pulling out own hair (time dimension to be individually determined). Long-Term Goal Client will be able to demonstrate adaptive copingstrategies in response to stress and a discontinua-tion of pulling out own hair (time dimension to beindividually determined). Interventions Support client in his or her effort to stop hairpulling. Help client understand that it is possibleto discontinue the behavior. Client realizes that thebehavior is maladaptive, but feels helpless to stop.Support from the nurse builds trust. Ensure that a nonjudgmental attitude is conveyed,and criticism of the behavior is avoided. An atti-tude of acceptance promotes feelings of dignityand self-worth. Assist the client with habit-reversal therapy (HRT), which has been shown to be an effective tool intreatment of hair-pulling disorder. Components ofHRT include the following: Awareness training. Help the client become aware of times when the hair pulling most often occurs(e.g., client learns to recognize urges, thoughts, orsensations that precede the behavior; the therapistpoints out to the client each time the behavior occurs). This helps the client identify situations inwhich the behavior occurs, or is most likely tooccur. Awareness gives the client a feeling of increased self-control. Competing response training. In this step, the client learns to substitute another response to theurge to pull his or her hair. For example, when aclient experiences a hair-pulling urge, suggestthat the individual ball up his or her hands intofists, tightening arm muscles, and \"locking\" his orher arms so as to make hair pulling impossible atthat moment (Golomb et al., 2011). Substitutingan incompatible behavior may help to extinguishthe undesirable behavior.Social support. Encourage family members to par- ticipate in the therapy process and to offer positivefeedback for attempts at habit reversal. Positivefeedback enhances self-esteem and increases theclient's desire to continue with the therapy. It alsoprovides cues for family members to use in theirattempts to help the client in treatment. Once the client has become aware of hair-pullingtimes, suggest that the client hold something (aball, paperweight, or other item) in his or her handat times when hair pulling is anticipated. Thiswould help to prevent behaviors occurring withoutthe client being aware that they are happening. Practice stress management techniques: deep breath-ing, meditation, stretching, physical exercise, listen-ing to soft music. Hair pulling is thought to occur attimes of increased anxiety. Offer support and encouragement when setbacksoccur. Help the client to understand the impor-tance of not quitting when it seems that change isnot happening as quickly as he or she would like.Although some people see a decrease in the behav-ior within a few days, most will take several monthsto notice the greatest change. Concept Care Mapping The concept map care plan is an innovative ap-proach to planning and organizing nursing care (seeChapter 9). It is a diagrammatic teaching and learn-ing strategy that allows visualization of interrelation-ships between medical diagnoses, nursing diagnoses,assessment data, and treatments. An example of aconcept map care plan for the client with an anxietydisorder is presented in Figure 27-4. Client/Family Education The role of client teacher is important in the psychi-atric area, as it is in all areas of nursing. A list of topicsfor client/family education relevant to anxiety disor-ders is presented in Box 27-6. Evaluation In the final step of the nursing process, a reassess-ment is conducted to determine if the nursing actionshave been successful in achieving the objectives ofcare. Evaluation of the nursing actions for the clientwith an anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, or related dis-order may be facilitated by gathering information utilizing the following types of questions: Can the client recognize signs and symptoms of escalating anxiety? Can the client use skills learned to interrupt the escalating anxiety before it reaches the panic level? Can the client demonstrate the activities most appropriate for him or her that can be used toCHAPTER 27 Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive, and Related Disorders 5474092_Ch27_528-558 24/07/14 5:30 PM Page 547548 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation Clinical Vignette: During her senior year in college, Candice, now age 24, began having panic attacks. All during her college years, she had experienced high anxiety and spent time with a counselor because of severe test anxiety.The college physician prescribed buspirone 15 mg/day, which has been helpful and eased some of her symptoms.She married shortly after graduation and works as a website designer from her computer at home. She must visitclients in their offices several times a week. Lately, she has started having panic attacks when it is time to make herclient visits. She tells the psychiatric nurse practitioner at the mental health clinic, \"Just thinking about leaving myhouse causes me to panic. I have chest pains, I have trouble breathing. I get dizzy, and I feel like I'm going to passout! My clients are getting upset with me for not keeping my appointments.

Can the client with trichotillomania successfullysubstitute a more adaptive behavior when urges topull hair occur? Does the client with body dysmorphic disorder verbalize a realistic perception and satisfactory acceptance of personal appearance? Treatment Modalities Individual Psychotherapy Most clients experience a marked lessening of anxietywhen given the opportunity to discuss their difficul-ties with a concerned and sympathetic therapist.Sadock & Sadock (2007) state: [Insight-oriented psychotherapy] focuses on helping patients understand the hypothesized unconsciousmeaning of the anxiety, the symbolism of the avoidedsituation, the need to repress impulses, and the sec-ondary gains of the symptoms. (p. 596) With continuous and regular contact with an inter- ested, sympathetic, and encouraging professionalperson, patients may be able to function by virtue of this help, without which their symptoms would incapacitate them. (p. 612) The psychotherapist also can use logical and ra- tional explanations to increase the client's under- standing about various situations that create anxietyin his or her life. Psychoeducational information mayalso be presented in individual psychotherapy. Cognitive Therapy The cognitive model relates how individuals respondin stressful situations to their subjective cognitive appraisal of the event. Anxiety is experienced whenthe cognitive appraisal is one of danger with which theindividual perceives that he or she is unable to cope.Impaired cognition can contribute to anxiety and re-lated disorders when the individual's appraisals arechronically negative. Automatic negative appraisalsprovoke self-doubts, negative evaluations, and negativepredictions. Anxiety is maintained by this dysfunc-tional appraisal of a situation. Cognitive therapy strives to assist the individual to reduce anxiety responses by altering cognitive distor-tions. Anxiety is described as being the result of exag-gerated, automatic thinking. Cognitive therapy for anxiety is brief and time limited, usually lasting from 5 to 20 sessions.

Individual psychotherapy4092_Ch27_528-558 24/07/14 5:30 PM Page 549therapy discourages the client's dependency on the therapist, which is prevalent in anxiety disorders, andencourages the client's self-sufficiency. A sound therapeutic relationship is a necessary con- dition for effective cognitive therapy. For the therapeuticprocess to occur, the client must be able to talk openlyabout fears and feelings. A major part of treatment con-sists of encouraging the client to face frightening situa-tions to be able to view them realistically, and talkingabout them is one way of achieving this. Treatment is acollaborative effort between client and therapist. Rather than offering suggestions and explanations, the therapist uses questions to encourage the client tocorrect his or her anxiety-producing thoughts. Theclient is encouraged to become aware of the thoughts,examine them for cognitive distortions, substitutemore balanced thoughts, and eventually develop newpatterns of thinking. Cognitive therapy is very structured and orderly, which is important for the client with an anxiety orrelated disorder who is often confused and lacks self-assurance. The focus is on solving current problems.Together, the client and therapist work to identify andcorrect maladaptive thoughts and behaviors thatmaintain a problem and block its solution. Cognitive therapy is based on education. The premise is that one develops anxiety because he orshe has learned inappropriate ways of handling lifeexperiences. The belief is that with practice, individ-uals can learn more effective ways of responding tothese experiences. Homework assignments, a centralfeature of cognitive therapy, provide an experimental,problem-solving approach to overcoming long-heldanxieties. Through fulfillment of these personal \"ex-periments,\" the effectiveness of specific strategies andtechniques is determined. Behavior Therapy Behavior modification has been used to treat trichotil-lomania. Various techniques have been tried, includingcovert desensitization and HRT (habit-reversal therapy).These may include a system of positive and negative reinforcements in an effort to modify the hair-pullingbehaviors. With HRT, in an attempt to extinguish theunwanted behavior, the individual learns to becomemore aware of the hair pulling, identify times of occurrence, and substitute a more adaptive coping strat-egy. (See interventions listed under the nursing diagno-sis section \"Ineffective Impulse Control.\") Other forms of behavior therapy include system- atic desensitization and implosion therapy (flooding ). They are commonly used to treat clients with phobicdisorders and to modify the stereotyped behavior of clients with OCD. They have also been shown to be effective in a variety of other anxiety-producingsituations. Systematic Desensitization In systematic desensitization, the client is graduallyexposed to the phobic stimulus, either in a real orimagined situation. The concept was introduced byJoseph Wolpe in 1958, and is based on behavioralconditioning principles. Emphasis is placed on recip-rocal inhibition or counterconditioning. Reciprocal inhibition is described as the restriction of anxiety prior to the effort of reducing avoidancebehavior. The rationale behind this concept is thatbecause relaxation is antagonistic to anxiety, individ-uals cannot be anxious and relaxed at the same time. Systematic desensitization with reciprocal inhibi- tion involves two main elements: 1.Training in relaxation techniques. 2.Progressive exposure to a hierarchy of fear stimuliwhile in the relaxed state. The individual is instructed in the art of relaxation using techniques most effective for him or her (e.g.,progressive relaxation, mental imagery , tense and relax, meditation). When the individual has masteredthe relaxation technique, exposure to the phobicstimulus is initiated. He or she is asked to present ahierarchal arrangement of situations pertaining tothe phobic stimulus in order from most disturbing toleast disturbing. While in a state of maximum relax-ation, the client may be asked to imagine the phobicstimulus. Initial exposure is focused on a concept ofthe phobic stimulus that produces the least amountof fear or anxiety. In subsequent sessions, the individ-ual is gradually exposed to stimuli that are more fear-ful. Sessions may be executed in fantasy, in real-life(in vivo) situations, or sometimes in a combination of both. Following is a case study describing systematicdesensitization.550 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation CASE STUDY: SYSTEMATIC DESENSITIZATION John was afraid to ride on elevators. He had been known to climb 24 flights of stairs in an office building to avoidriding the elevator. John's own insurance office had plansfor moving the company to a high-rise building soon, withoffices on the 32nd floor. John sought assistance from atherapist for help to treat this fear. He was taught to achievea sense of calmness and well-being by using a combinationof mental imagery and progressive relaxation techniques. Inthe relaxed state, John was initially instructed to imagine theentry level of his office building, with a clear image of the 4092_Ch27_528-558 24/07/14 5:30 PM Page 550Implosion Therapy (Flooding) Implosion therapy, or flooding , is a therapeutic process in which the client must imagine situations or participate in real-life situations that he or she finds extremelyfrightening, for a prolonged period of time. Relax-ation training is not a part of this technique. Plenty oftime must be allowed for these sessions because briefperiods may be ineffective or even harmful. A sessionis terminated when the client responds with consider-ably less anxiety than at the beginning of the session. In implosion therapy, the therapist \"floods\" the client with information concerning situations thattrigger anxiety in him or her. The therapist describesanxiety-provoking situations in vivid detail and isguided by the client's response; the more anxiety provoked, the more expedient is the therapeutic endeavor. The same theme is continued as long as itarouses anxiety. The therapy is continued until a topicno longer elicits inappropriate anxiety on the part ofthe client. Sadock and Sadock (2007) state: Many patients refuse flooding because of the psycho- logical discomfort involved. It is also contraindicatedwhen intense anxiety would be hazardous to a patient(e.g., those with heart disease or fragile psychologicaladaptation). The technique works best with specificphobias. (p. 955) Psychopharmacology Antianxiety Agents Antianxiety drugs are also called anxiolytics andminor tranquilizers. Examples of commonly used antianxiety agents are presented in Table 27-4. Indications Antianxiety agents are used in the treatment of anxiety disorders, anxiety symptoms, acute alcohol withdrawal,CHAPTER 27 Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive, and Related Disorders 551 CASE STUDY: SYSTEMATIC DESENSITIZATION\u2014 cont'd bank of elevators. In subsequent sessions, and always in the relaxed state, John progressed to images of walkingonto an elevator, having the elevator door close after he hadentered, riding the elevator to the 32nd floor, and emergingfrom the elevator once the doors were opened. The pro-gression included being accompanied in the activities bythe therapist and eventually accomplishing them alone.Therapy for John also included in vivo sessions in which he was exposed to the phobic stimulus in real-life situations(always after achieving a state of relaxation). This technique,combining imagined and in vivo procedures, proved suc- cessful for John, and his employment in the high-rise com-plex was no longer in jeopardy because of his fear ofelevators.

Action Antianxiety drugs depress subcortical levels of the CNS,particularly the limbic system and reticular formation.They may of the powerful in-hibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) in the brain, thereby producing a calmativeeffect. All levels of CNS depression can be affected,from mild sedation to hypnosis to coma. Note: Bus- pirone does not depress the CNS. Although its actionis unknown, the drug is believed to produce the de-sired effects through interactions with serotonin,dopamine, and other neurotransmitter receptors. Contraindications/Precautions Antianxiety drugs are contraindicated in individualswith known hypersensitivity to any of the drugs withinthe classification (e.g., benzodiazepines). They shouldnot be taken in combination with other CNS depres-sants and are contraindicated in pregnancy and lacta-tion, narrow-angle glaucoma, shock, and coma. Caution should be taken in administering these drugs to elderly or debilitated clients and clients withhepatic or renal dysfunction. (The dosage usually hasto be decreased.) Caution is also required with individ-uals who have a history of drug abuse or addiction andwith those who are depressed or suicidal. In depressedclients, CNS depressants can exacerbate symptoms. Interactions Increased effects of antianxiety agents can occur whentaken concomitantly with alcohol, antidepressants, antihistamines,neuromuscular blocking agents, cimetidine, or disulfi-ram. can also occur with herbal depres-sants (e.g., kava, valerian).

They can be prescribed on an as-neededbasis when the client is feeling particularly anxious.Alprazolam, lorazepam, and clonazepam have beenparticularly effective in the treatment of panic disor - der. The major risks with benzodiazepine therapy arephysical dependence and tolerance, which may en-courage abuse. Because withdrawal symptoms can be life threatening, clients must be warned againstabrupt discontinuation of the drug and should be tapered off the medication at the end of therapy. Because of this addiction potential, the benzodi-azepines have been surpassed as first-line choice of treatment by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors the antianxiety agent buspirone is effective in about 60 to 80 percent of clients with generalized anxiety dis-order (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). One disadvantage ofbuspirone is its 10- to 14-day delay in alleviating symp-toms. However, the benefit of lack of physical depend-ence and tolerance with buspirone may make it thedrug of choice in the treatment of generalized anxietydisorder. Antidepressants Several antidepressants are effective as major antianxiety agents. The tricyclics clomipramine and imipramine have been used with success in clientsexperiencing panic disorder. However , since the advent of SSRIs, the tricyclics are less widely used because oftheir tendency to produce severe side effects at the highdoses required to relieve symptoms of panic disorder. The SSRIs have been effective in the treatment of panic disorder. Paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertralinehave been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Ad-ministration (FDA) for this purpose. The dosage ofthese drugs must be titrated slowly because clientswith panic disorder appear to be sensitive to the over-stimulation caused by SSRIs. The use of antidepressants in the treatment of gen- eralized anxiety disorder is still being investigated.Some success has been reported with the tricyclicimipramine and with the SSRIs. The FDA has approvedparoxetine, escitalopram, duloxetine, and extended-release venlafaxine in the treatment of generalizedanxiety disorder. Complete information about antide-pressants is presented in Chapter 25. Antihypertensive Agents Several studies have called attention to the effectiveness of beta blockers (e.g., pro- pranolol) and alpha 2-receptor agonists (e.g., cloni- dine) in the amelioration of anxiety symptoms(Hollander & Simeon, 2008). Propranolol has potenteffects on the somatic manifestations of anxiety (e.g.,palpitations, tremors), with less dramatic effects on thepsychic component of anxiety. It appears to be most effective in the treatment of acute situational anxiety(e.g., performance anxiety, test anxiety), but it is notthe first-line drug of choice in the treatment of panicdisorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Clonidine is effective in blocking the acute anxiety effects in conditions such as opioid and nicotine with-drawal. However, it has had limited usefulness in thelong-term treatment of panic and generalized anxietydisorders, particularly because of the development oftolerance to its antianxiety effects. For Phobic Disorders Anxiolytics The benzodiazepines have been successful in the treatment of social anxiety disorder (social pho-bia) (Hollander & Simeon, 2008). Controlled studieshave shown the efficacy of alprazolam and clon-azepam in reducing symptoms of social anxiety. Both are well tolerated and have a rapid onset of action.However , because of their potential for abuse and dependence, they are not considered first-line choiceof treatment for social anxiety disorder. the monoamine oxidase inhibitor have been effective in diminishing symptoms of ago-raphobia and social anxiety disorder. In recent years, the SSRIs have become the first-line treatment ofchoice for social anxiety disorder , and paroxetine and sertraline have been approved for this purpose. Ad-ditional clinical trials have also indicated efficacy withother antidepressants, including nefazodone, ven-lafaxine, and bupropion. Specific phobias are gener-ally not treated with medication unless panic attacksaccompany the phobia. Antihypertensive Agents The beta blockers propranolol and atenolol have been tried with success in clients experiencing anticipatory performance anxiety or \"stage fright\" (Hollander & Simeon, 2008). This typeof phobic response produces symptoms such as sweatypalms, racing pulse, trembling hands, dry mouth, la-bored breathing, nausea, and memory loss. The betablockers appear to be quite effective in reducingthese symptoms in some individuals. For Obsessive-Compulsive fluoxetine, approved by theFDA for the treatment of OCD. Doses in excess of what is effective for treating depression may be required for OCD. Common side effects include sleepdisturbances, headache, and restlessness. These effects are often transient, and are less troublesomethan those of the tricyclics.CHAPTER 27 Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive, and Related Disorders 5534092_Ch27_528-558 24/07/14 5:30 PM Page 553The tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine was the first drug approved by the FDA in the treatment of OCD. Clomipramine is more selective for sero-tonin reuptake than any of the other tricyclics. Its efficacy in the treatment of OCD is well established,although the adverse effects, such as those associatedwith all the tricyclics, may make it less desirable thanthe SSRIs. For Body Dysmorphic Disorder Antidepressants The most positive results of pharma- cological therapy with body dysmorphic disorder havebeen with clomipramine (Anafranil) and fluoxetine(Prozac). These medications have been shown to reduce symptoms in more than 50 percent of clientswith the disorder (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). For Trichotillomania Various psychopharmacological agents, includingchlorpromazine, amitriptyline, and lithium carbon-ate, have been tried in the treatment of trichotilloma-nia, with moderate results. Recent success with SSRIsaugmented with pimozide has been reported. One re-cent study showed olanzapine to be a safe and effec-tive treatment for trichotillomania (Van Ameringen,Mancini, Patterson, Bennett, & Oakman, 2010).554 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation CASE STUDY AND SAMPLE CARE PLAN NURSING HISTORY AND ASSESSMENT Karen is a 34-year-old mother of a 7-year-old girl named April. Karen's husband, Jake, brought Karen to the emer-gency department when she began complaining of chestpain and shortness of breath. Diagnostic testing ruled outcardiac problems, and Karen was referred for psychiatricevaluation. Jake is present at the admission interview. Heexplained to the nurse that Karen has become increasingly\"nervous and high-strung\" over the past few years. Fouryears ago, April, then 3 years old, was attending nurseryschool 2 days a week. April came down with a very severecase of influenza that developed into pneumonia. She washospitalized and her prognosis was questionable for a shortwhile, although she eventually made a complete recovery.Since that time, however, Karen has been extremely anx-ious about her family's health. She is fastidious abouthousekeeping, and scrubs her floors three times a week.She launders the bedclothes daily, and uses bleach onall the countertops and door handles several times a day.She washes the woodwork twice a week. She washes her hands incessantly, and they are red and noticeablychapped. Jake explained that Karen becomes very upset ifshe is not able to perform all of her cleaning \"chores\" ac-cording to her self-assigned schedule. This afternoon, Aprilcame home from school with a note from the teacher say-ing that a child in April's class had been diagnosed with acase of meningitis. Jake told the nurse, \"Karen just lost it.She got all upset and started crying and had trouble breath-ing. Then she got those pains in her chest. That's when Ibrought her to the hospital.\" Karen is admitted to the psy-chiatric unit with a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive dis-order. The physician orders alprazolam 0.5 mg tid andparoxetine 20 mg every morning. The night nurse finds her up at 2 a.m. scrubbing the shower with a hand towel. She refuses to sleep in the bed,stating that it must certainly be contaminated. When theday nurse makes morning rounds, she finds Karen in thebathroom washing her hands.NURSING DIAGNOSES/OUTCOME IDENTIFICATION From the assessment data, the nurse develops the following nursing diagnoses for Karen: 1.Panic anxiety related to perceived threat to biolog ical integ rity evidenced by chest pain and shortness of breath. a.Short-Term Goal: Client will be able to relax with effects of medication. b.Long-Term Goal: Client will be able to maintain anxiety at manageable level. 2.Ineffective coping related to panic anxiety and weak ego streng th evidenced by compulsive cleaning and washing hands. a.Shor t-Term Goal: Client will reduce amount of time performing rituals within 3 days. b.Long-Term Goal: Client will demonstrate ability to cope effectively without resorting to ritualistic behavior. PLANNING/IMPLEMENTATION PANIC ANXIETY The following nursing interventions have been identified forKaren: 1.Stay with Karen and reassure her that she is safe and that she is not going to die. 2.Maintain a calm, nonthreatening manner with Karen. 3.Speak very clearly, calmly, and use simple words andmessages to communicate with Karen. 4.Keep the lights low, the noise level down as much as possible, and as few people in her environment as isnecessary . 5.Administer the alprazolam and paroxetine as ordered bythe physician. Monitor for effectiveness and side effects. 6.After several days, when the anxiety has subsided, discusswith her the reasons that precipitated this attack. 7.T each her the signs that indicate her anxiety level is rising. 4092_Ch27_528-558 24/07/14 5:30 PM Page 554CHAPTER 27 Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive, and Related Disorders 555 C A S E S T U D Y A N D S A M P L E C A R E P L A N \u2014cont'd 8.Teach strategies that she may employ to interrupt the es- calation of the anxiety. She could choose which is best for her: rela xation exercises, physical exercise, meditation. INEFFECTIVE COPING The following nursing interventions have been identifiedfor Karen: 1.Initially, allow Karen all the time she needs to wash her hands, straighten up her room, change her own sheets,etc. To deny her these rituals would result in panic anxiety . 2.Initiate discussions with Karen about her behavior. Sheultimately must come to understand that these ritualsare her way of keeping her anxiety under control. 3.Within a couple of days, begin to limit the amount oftime Karen may spend on her rituals. Assign her togroups and activities that take up her time and distract her from her obsessions. 4.Explore with Karen the types of situations that causeher anxiety to rise. Help her to correlate these times ofincreased anxiety to initiation of the ritualistic behavior . 5.Help her with problem-solving and with making decisionsabout more adaptive ways to respond to situations thatcause her anxiety to rise. 6.Explore her fears surrounding the health of her daugh-ter. Help her to recognize which fears are leg itimate and which are irrational.7.Discuss possible activities in which she may participatethat may distract from obsessions about contamination.Make suggestions, and encourage her to follow through.Examples may include enrollment in classes at the localcommunity college, volunteer work at the local hospital,or par t-time employment. 8.Explain to her that she will likely be discharged from thehospital with a prescription for paroxetine. T e ach her about the medication, how it should be taken, possibleside effects, and what to report to the physician. 9.Suggest that she may benefit from attendance in an anx-iety disorder suppor t g roup. If she is interested, help locate one that would be convenient and appropriate for her. EVALUATION The outcome criteria for Karen have been met. She has re-mained calm during her hospital stay with the use of themedication. The use of ritualistic behavior in the hospitalsetting diminished rapidly. She has discussed situations thatshe knows cause her anxiety to rise. She has learned relax-ation exercises and practices them daily. She plans to startjogging and has the phone number for an anxiety supportgroup that she plans to call. She says that she hopes thesupport group will help her maintain rationality about herdaughter's health. She knows about paroxetine and plansto take it every morning. Summary and Key Points Anxiety is a necessary force for survival and has been experienced by humanity throughout the ages. Anxiety was first described as a physiological disorderand identified by its physical symptoms, particularlythe cardiac symptoms. The psychological implica-tions for the symptoms were not recognized until theearly 1900s. Anxiety is considered a normal reaction to a realisticdanger or threat to biological integrity or self-concept. Normality of the anxiety experienced in response toa stressor is defined by societal and cultural standards. Anxiety disorders are more common in womenthan in men by at least two to one. Studies of familial patterns suggest that a familialpredisposition to anxiety disorders probably exists. The DSM-5 identifies several broad categories of anxiety and related disorders. They include panicand generalized anxiety disorders, phobic disor-ders, and OCD and related disorders, such as bodydysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania, and hoard-ing disorder. Anxiety disorders may also be the result of other medical conditions and intoxicationor withdrawal from substances. Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent panicattacks, the onset of which are unpredictable andmanifested by intense apprehension, fear, andphysical discomfort. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized bychronic, unrealistic, and excessive anxiety and worry. Social anxiety disorder is an excessive fear of situa-tions in which a person might do something embar-rassing or be evaluated negatively by others. Specific phobia is a marked, persistent, and exces-sive or unreasonable fear when in the presence of,or when anticipating an encounter with, a specificobject or situation. Agoraphobia is a fear of being in places or situa-tions from which escape might be difficult or inwhich help might not be available in the event thatthe person becomes anxious. OCD involves recurrent obsessions or compulsionsthat are severe enough to interfere with social andoccupational functioning. Body dysmorphic disorder is an exaggerated belief thatthe body is deformed or defective in some specific way. Trichotillomania (also known as hair-pulling disor-der) is a disorder of impulse control characterizedby the recurrent pulling out of one's own hair thatresults in noticeable hair loss. Hoarding disorder is defined by the persistent difficulty of discarding or parting with possessions,regardless of their actual value.4092_Ch27_528-558 24/07/14 5:31 of fac- tors, biological influences, and learning experi-ences most likely contribute to the development ofthese disorders. Treatment of anxiety and related disorders includesindividual psychotherapy, cognitive therapy, behav-ior therapy (including implosion therapy, system-atic desensitization, and habit-reversal therapy),and psychopharmacology. Nurses can help clients with anxiety and relateddisorders gain insight and increase self-awarenessin relation to their illness.Intervention focuses on assisting clients to learntechniques with which they may interrupt the esca-lation of anxiety before it reaches unmanageableproportions, and to replace maladaptive behaviorpatterns with new, more adaptive, coping skills.556 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation Additional info available at www.davisplus.com Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

They were at a dinner party when Sarah suddenly claspedher chest and started having difficulty breathing. She complainedof nausea and was perspiring profusely. She had calmed downsome by the time they reached the hospital. She denied any pain,and electrocardiogram and laboratory results were unremarkable. Sarah told the admitting nurse that she had a history of these \"attacks.\" She began having them in her sophomore year of college.She knew her parents had expectations that she should follow intheir footsteps and become an attorney. They also expected her toearn grades that would promote acceptance by a top Ivy Leagueuniversity.

Adjustment disorder carried its own classification, and was identified as \"a psychological response to an identifiable stressor orstressors\" (APA, 2000, p. 679). In the DSM-5 (APA,2013), these disorders have been combined into a single chapter titled \"Trauma- and Stressor-RelatedDisorders.\" The movement of these disorders in thismanner \"reflects increased recognition of trauma as aprecipitant, emphasizing common etiology over com-mon phenomenology\" (Friedman et al., 2011, p. 737). This chapter focuses on disorders that occur fol- lowing exposure to an identifiable stressor or to an 5594092_Ch28_559-580 24/07/14 5:31 PM Page 559extreme traumatic event. Epidemiological statistics are presented, and predisposing factors associatedwith the etiology of these disorders are discussed. Anexplanation of the symptomatology is presented asbackground knowledge for assessing clients withtrauma- and stressor-related disorders. Nursing careis described in the context of the nursing process. Various treatment modalities are explored. Historical and Epidemiological Data The concept of a post-trauma response is not new. Ithas been known throughout the centuries by termssuch as shell shock, battle fatigue, accident neurosis,and posttraumatic neurosis. Reports of symptoms andsyndromes with PTSD-like features have existed inwriting throughout the centuries. In the early part ofthe 20th century, traumatic neurosis was viewed as theego's inability to master the degree of disorganizationbrought about by a traumatic experience. Very littlewas written about posttraumatic neurosis during theyears between 1950 and 1970. This absence was fol-lowed in the 1970s and 1980s with an explosion in theamount of research and writing on the subject. Manyof the papers written during this time were about Vietnam veterans. Clearly, the renewed interest inPTSD was linked to the psychological casualties of theVietnam War. The diagnostic category of PTSD did not appear until the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statisti- cal Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM- III) in 1980, after a need was indicated by increasing numbersof problems with Vietnam veterans and victims of multiple disasters. The DSM-IV-TR (2000) de- scribed the trauma that precedes PTSD as an eventthat is outside the range of usual human experi-ence, such as rape, war, physical attack, torture, ornatural or man-made disaster. About 60 percent of men and 50 percent of women are exposed to a traumatic event in their lifetime (De-partment of Veterans Affairs, 2012). Women are morelikely to experience sexual assault and childhood sex-ual abuse, whereas men are more likely to experienceaccidents, physical assaults, combat, or to witnessdeath or injury. Although the exposure to trauma ishigh, less than 10 percent of trauma victims developPTSD (Breslau, 2009). The disorder appears to bemore common in women than in men. Historically, as previously stated, individuals who ex- perienced stress reactions that followed exposure toan extreme traumatic event were given the diagnosisof PTSD. Accordingly, stress reactions from \"normal\"daily events (e.g., divorce, failure, rejection) were char-acterized as adjustment disorders, rather than PTSD(Friedman, 1996).A number of studies have indicated that adjust- ment disorders are probably quite common. Sadockand Sadock (2007) report: Adjustment disorders are one of the most common psychiatric diagnoses for disorders of patients hospi-talized for medical and surgical problems. In onestudy, 5 percent of people admitted to a hospital overa 3-year period were classified as having an adjust-ment disorder. (p. 786) Adjustment disorders are more common in women, unmarried persons, and younger people (Black & Andreasen, 2011). It can occur at any age, from child-hood to senescence. Application of the Nursing Process\u2014 Trauma-Related Disorders560 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation CORE CONCEPT Trauma An extremely distressing experience that causes severe emotional shock and may have long-lasting psycholog-ical effects. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Acute Stress Disorder Background Assessment Data Puri and Treasaden (2011) describe PTSD as \"a reac- tion to an extreme trauma, which is likely to causepervasive distress to almost anyone, such as natural orman-made disasters, combat, serious accidents, wit-nessing the violent death of others, being the victimof torture, terrorism, rape, or other crimes\" (p. 197).PTSD symptoms are not related to common experi-ences such as uncomplicated bereavement, maritalconflict, or chronic illness, but are associated withevents that would be markedly distressing to almostanyone. The individual may experience the traumaalone or in the presence of others. Characteristic symptoms include reexperiencing the traumatic event, a sustained high level of anxietyor arousal, or a general numbing of responsiveness.Intrusive recollections or nightmares of the event arecommon. Some individuals may be unable to remem-ber certain aspects of the trauma. Symptoms of depression are common with this disorder and may be severe enough to warrant a diagnosis of a depressive disorder. In the case of a life-threatening trauma shared with others, survivorsoften describe painful guilt feelings about survivingwhen others did not or about the things they had todo to survive. Substance abuse, anger and aggressivebehavior, and relationship problems are common.4092_Ch28_559-580 24/07/14 5:31 PM Page 560The full symptom picture must be present for more than 1 month and cause significant interference withsocial, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The disorder can occur at any age. Symptoms maybegin within the first 3 months after the trauma, orthere may be a delay of several months or even years.The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD are presented in Box 28-1. The DSM-5 describes another disorder that is similar to PTSD called acute stress disorder (ASD) .There are similarities between the two disorders in terms of pre-cipitating traumatic events and symptomatology, but inASD, the symptoms are time limited, up to 1 month fol-lowing the trauma. By definition, if the symptoms lastlonger than 1 month, the diagnosis would be PTSD.The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ASD are presented in Box 28-2.

Note: Symp-toms typically begin immediately after the trauma, but persistence for at least 3 days and up to a month isneeded to meet disorder criteria. D. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or im- pairment in social, occupational, or other important areasof functioning. E. The disturbance is not attributable to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., medication or alcohol) or an-other medical condition (e.g., mild traumatic brain injury),and is not better explained by brief psychotic disorder.

Variables include characteristicsthat relate to (1) the traumatic experience, (2) the individual, and (3) the recovery environment. The Traumatic Experience Specific characteristics relating to the trauma havebeen identified as crucial elements in the determina-tion of an individual's long-term response to stress.They include: Severity and duration of the stressor Extent of anticipatory preparation for the event Exposure to death Numbers affected by life threat Amount of control over recurrence Location where the trauma was experienced (e.g., familiar surroundings, at home, in a foreign country) The Individual Variables that are considered important in determin-ing an individual's response to trauma include: Degree of ego-strength Effectiveness of coping resources Presence of preexisting psychopathology Outcomes of previous experiences with stress/trauma Behavioral tendencies (temperament) Current psychosocial developmental stage Demographic factors (e.g., age, socioeconomicstatus, education) The Recovery Environment It has been suggested that the quality of the environ-ment in which the individual attempts to work throughthe traumatic experience is correlated with the out-come. Environmental variables include: Availability of social supports The cohesiveness and protectiveness of family andfriends The attitudes of society regarding the experience Cultural and subcultural influences In research with Vietnam veterans, it was shown that the best predictors of PTSD were the severity ofthe stressor and the degree of psychosocial isolationin the recovery environment. Learning Theory Learning theorists view negative reinforcement as be-havior that leads to a reduction in an aversive experi-ence, thereby reinforcing and resulting in repetitionof the behavior. The avoidance behaviors and psychicnumbing in response to a trauma are mediated bynegative reinforcement (behaviors that decrease theemotional pain of the trauma). Behavioral distur-bances, such as anger and aggression and drug andalcohol abuse, are the behavioral patterns that are re-inforced by their capacity to reduce objectionablefeelings.Cognitive Theory These models take into consideration the cognitiveappraisal of an event and focus on assumptions thatan individual makes about the world. Epstein (1991)outlines three fundamental beliefs that most peopleconstruct within a personal theory of reality: The world is benevolent and a source of joy. The world is meaningful and controllable. The self is worthy (e.g., lovable, good, and competent). As life situations occur, some disequilibrium is ex- pected to occur until accommodation for the changehas been made and it has become assimilated intoone's personal theory of reality. An individual is vul-nerable to trauma-related disorders when the funda-mental beliefs are invalidated by a trauma that cannotbe comprehended and a sense of helplessness andhopelessness prevails. One's appraisal of the environ-ment can be drastically altered. Biological Aspects It has been suggested that an individual who has experienced previous trauma is more likely to de-velop symptoms after a stressful life event (Hollander& Simeon, 2008). These individuals with previoustraumatic experiences may be more likely to becomeexposed to future traumas, as they can be inclined toreactivate the behaviors associated with the originaltrauma. Hollander and Simeon also report on studies that suggest an endogenous opioid peptide response mayassist in the maintenance of chronic PTSD. The hy-pothesis supports a type of \"addiction to the trauma,\"which is explained in the following manner. Opioids, including endogenous opioid peptides, have the following psychoactive properties: Tranquilizing action Reduction of rage/aggression Reduction of paranoia Reduction of feelings of inadequacy Antidepressant action These studies suggest that physiological arousal ini- tiated endogenous opioid peptidesand results in increased feelings of comfort and con-trol. When the stressor terminates, the individual mayexperience opioid withdrawal, the symptoms of whichbear strong resemblance to those of PTSD. Other biological systems have also been implicated in the symptomatology of PTSD. Hageman and asso-ciates (2001) state: It is reasonable to suggest that any disorder such as PTSD that can persist for decades (e.g., Holocaust sur-vivors and Vietnam veterans) is associated with meas-urable biological features. Evidence suggests thatbiological dysregulation of in the pathophysiology ofPTSD. (p. 412) Diagnosis/Outcome Identification Nursing diagnoses are formulated from the data gath- ered during the assessment phase and with back-ground knowledge regarding predisposing factors tothe disorder. Some common nursing diagnoses forclients with trauma-related disorders include: Post-trauma syndrome related to distressing eventconsidered to be outside the range of usual humanexperience evidenced by flashbacks, intrusive rec-ollections, nightmares, psychological numbness related to the event, dissociation, or amnesia. Complicated grieving related to loss of self as per-ceived before the trauma or other actual or perceivedlosses incurred during or after the event evidencedby irritability and explosiveness, self-destructiveness,substance abuse, verbalization of survival guilt, orguilt about behavior required for survival. The following criteria may be used for measurement of outcomes in the care of the client with a trauma-related disorder. The client: Can acknowledge the traumatic event and the impact it has had on his or her life Is experiencing fewer flashbacks, intrusive recollec-tions, and nightmares than he or she was on admis-sion (or at the beginning of therapy)Can demonstrate adaptive coping strategies (e.g.,relaxation techniques, mental imagery, music, art) Can concentrate and has made realistic goals forthe future Includes significant others in the recovery processand willingly accepts their support Verbalizes no ideas or intent of self-harm Has worked through feelings of survivor's guilt Gets enough sleep to avoid risk of injury Verbalizes community resources from which he orshe may seek assistance in times of stress Attends support group of individuals who have re-covered or are recovering from similar traumaticexperiences Verbalizes desire to put the trauma in the past andprogress with his or her life Planning/Implementation The following section presents a group of selectednursing diagnoses, with short- and long-term goalsand nursing interventions for each. Post-trauma Syndrome Post-trauma syndrome is defined as \"a sustained maladap- tive response to a traumatic, overwhelming event\"(NANDA-International [NANDA-I], 2012, p. 335).Table 28-1 presents this nursing diagnosis in care planformat. Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined.564 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation Table 28-1 | CARE PLAN FOR THE CLIENT WITH A TRAUMA-RELATED DISORDER NURSING DIAGNOSIS: POST-TRAUMA SYNDROME RELATED TO: Distressing event considered to be outside the ra nge of usual human experience EVIDENCED BY: Flashbacks, intrusive recollections, nightmares, psychological numbness related to the event, dissocia- tion, or amnesia OUTCOME CRITERIA NURSING INTERVENTIONS RATIONALE Short-Term Goals \u0081 Client will begin a healthy grief resolution, initiating the process of psychological healing (within time frame specific to individual). \u0081 Client will demonstrate ability to deal with emotional reactions in an individually appropriate manner.1.a.

Assimilation of theevent into one's persona requiresthat some deg ree of meaning as- sociated with the event be incorpo-rated into the basic beliefs, whichwill affect how the individual even-tually comes to reappraise (Epstein, 1 991).4092_Ch28_559-580 24/07/14 5:31 PM Page 565Short-Term Goals The client will begin a healthy grief resolution, ini- tiating the process of psychological healing (withintime frame specific to individual). The client will demonstrate ability to deal withemotional reactions in an individually appropriatemanner. Long-Term Goal The client will integrate the traumatic experienceinto his or her persona, renew significant relation-ships, and establish meaningful goals for the future. Interventions A post-trauma client may be suspicious of others inhis or her environment. Establishing a trusting rela-tionship with this individual is essential before carecan be given. To do this, assign the same staff as oftenas possible. Use a nonthreatening, matter-of-fact butfriendly approach. Respect the client's wishes regard-ing interaction with individuals of the opposite genderat this time (especially important if the trauma wasrape). Be consistent and keep all promises, and con-vey an attitude of unconditional acceptance. Stay with the client during periods of flashbacksand nightmares. Offer reassurance of safety and se-curity and that these symptoms are not uncommonfollowing a trauma of the magnitude he or she hasexperienced. The presence of a trusted individualmay help to calm fears for personal safety and reassure the anxious client that he or she is not\"going crazy.\" Obtain an accurate history from significant othersabout the trauma and the client's specific response.Various types of traumas elicit different responsesin clients. For example, human-engendered trau-mas often generate a greater degree of humiliationand guilt in victims than trauma associated withnatural disasters. Encourage the client to talk about the trauma at his or her own pace. Provide a nonthreatening,private environment, and include a significantother if the client wishes. Acknowledge and vali-date the client's feelings as they are expressed. Thisdebriefing process is the first step in the progres-sion toward resolution. Discuss coping strategies used in response to thetrauma, as well as those used during stressful situa-tions in the past. Determine those that have beenmost helpful, and discuss alternative strategies forthe future. Include available support systems, in-cluding religious and cultural influences. Identifymaladaptive coping strategies, such as substance useor psychosomatic responses, and practice moreadaptive coping strategies for possible future post-trauma responses. Resolution of the posttrauma response is largely dependent on the effectivenessof the coping strategies employed. Assist the individual to try to comprehend thetrauma if possible. Discuss feelings of vulnerabilityand the individual's \"place\" in the world followingthe trauma. Post-trauma response is largely a func-tion of the shattering of basic beliefs the survivorholds about self and world. Assimilation of theevent into one's persona requires that some degreeof meaning associated with the event be incorpo-rated into the basic beliefs, which will affect howthe individual eventually comes to reappraise selfand world (Epstein, 1991). Complicated Grieving Complicated grieving is defined as \"a disorder that oc- curs after the death of a significant other [or any otherloss of significance to the individual], in which the experience of distress accompanying bereavementfails to follow normative expectations and manifests infunctional impairment\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 365). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal Client will verbalize feelings (guilt, anger, self-blame, hopelessness) associated with the trauma. Long-Term Goal Client will demonstrate progress in dealing withstages of grief and will verbalize a sense of opti-mism and hope for the future. Interventions Acknowledge feelings of guilt or self-blame thatclient may express. Guilt at having survived a traumain which others died is common. The client needsto discuss these feelings and recognize that he orshe is not responsible for what happened but musttake responsibility for own recovery. Assess stage of grief in which the client is fixed. Dis-cuss normalcy of feelings and behaviors related tostages of grief. Knowledge of grief stage is necessaryfor accurate intervention. Guilt may be generatedif client believes it is unacceptable to have these feel-ings. Knowing they are normal can provide a senseof relief. Assess impact of the trauma on client's ability to resume regular activities of daily living. Consider em-ployment, marital relationship, and sleep patterns.Following a trauma, individuals are at high risk forphysical injury because of disruption in ability toconcentrate and problem-solve and because of lackof sufficient sleep. Isolation and avoidance behaviorsmay interfere with interpersonal relatedness.566 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch28_559-580 24/07/14 5:31 PM Page 566Assess for self-destructive ideas and behavior. The trauma may result in feelings of hopelessness andworthlessness, leading to high risk for suicide. Assess for maladaptive coping strategies, such assubstance abuse. These behaviors interfere withand delay the recovery process. Identify available community resources from whichthe individual may seek assistance if problems withcomplicated grieving persist. Support groups forvictims of various types of traumas exist within mostcommunities. The presence of support systems inthe recovery environment has been identified as amajor predictor in the successful recovery fromtrauma. Concept Care Mapping The concept map care plan is an innovative approach toplanning and organizing nursing care (see Chapter 9).It is a diagrammatic teaching and learning strategy thatallows visualization of interrelationships between med-ical diagnoses, nursing diagnoses, assessment data, andtreatments. An example of a concept map care planfor a client with a trauma-related disorder is presentedin Figure 28-1. Evaluation Reassessment is conducted in order to determine ifthe nursing actions have been successful in achievingthe objectives of care. Evaluation of the nursing actions for the client with a trauma-related disordermay be facilitated by gathering information using thefollowing types of questions: Can the client discuss the traumatic event withoutexperiencing panic anxiety? Does the client voluntarily discuss the traumaticevent? Can the client discuss changes that have occurredin his or her life because of the traumatic event? Does the client have \"flashbacks?\" Can the client sleep without medication? Does the client have nightmares? Has the client learned new, adaptive coping strate-gies for assistance with recovery? Can the client demonstrate successful use of thesenew coping strategies in times of stress? Can the client verbalize stages of grief and the nor-mal behaviors associated with each? Can the client recognize his or her own position inthe grieving process? Is guilt being alleviated? Has the client maintained or regained satisfactoryrelationships with significant others? Can the client look to the future with optimism? Does the client attend a regular support group forvictims of similar traumatic experiences?Does the client have a plan of action for dealingwith symptoms, if they return? Application of the Nursing Process\u2014 Stressor-Related Disorders Adjustment Disorders\u2014Background Assessment DataCHAPTER 28 Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders 567 CORE CONCEPT Stress Mental, emotional, or physical strain experienced by an individual in response to stimuli from the external orinternal environment. An adjustment disorder is characterized by a mal- adaptive reaction to an identifiable stressor or stres-sors that results in the development of clinicallysignificant emotional or behavioral symptoms (APA,2013). The response occurs within 3 months afteronset of the stressor and has persisted for no longerthan 6 months after the stressor or its consequenceshave ended. The individual shows impairment in social and occupational functioning or exhibits symptoms thatare in excess of an expected reaction to the stressor.The symptoms are expected to remit soon after thestressor is relieved, or if the stressor persists, when anew level of adaptation is achieved. The DSM-5 diag- nostic criteria for adjustment disorders are presentedin Box 28-3. The stressor itself can be almost anything, but an individual's response to any particular stressor cannotbe predicted. If an individual is highly predisposed orvulnerable to maladaptive response, a severe form ofthe disorder may follow what most people would con-sider only a mild or moderate stressor. On the otherhand, a less vulnerable individual may develop only amild form of the disorder in response to what othersmight consider a severe stressor. A number of clinical presentations are associated with adjustment disorders. The following categories,identified by the DSM-5 (APA, 2013), are distinguished by the predominant features of the maladaptive response. Adjustment Disorder With Depressed Mood This category is the most commonly diagnosed adjust-ment disorder. The clinical presentation is one of pre-dominant mood disturbance, although less pronouncedthan that of major depressive disorder (MDD). Thesymptoms, such as depressed mood, tearfulness, andfeelings of hopelessness, exceed what is an expected ornormative response to an identified stressor.4092_Ch28_559-580 24/07/14 5:31 PM Page 567Adjustment Disorder With Anxiety This category denotes a maladaptive response to a stres- sor in which the predominant manifestation is anxiety.For example, the symptoms may reveal nervousness,worry, and jitteriness. The clinician must differentiatethis diagnosis from those of anxiety disorders.Adjustment Disorder With Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood The predominant features of this category include disturbances in mood (depression, feelings of hope-lessness and sadness) and manifestations of anxiety(nervousness, worry, jitteriness) that are more intense568 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation FIGURE 28-1 Concept map care plan for a client with posttraumatic stress disorder.Clinical Vignette: Charles is a 29-year-old veteran of two deployments to Afghanistan. He was honorably discharged from the army 2 years ago and has resumed his position as an assemblyman with a large automobile manufacturingcompany. His wife reports that he has begun having nightmares, seems angry and bitter, and feels guilty that hesurvived while many of his friends had not. Recently, while working in their backyard, he threw himself on the groundat the sound of a helicopter flying overhead. Lately, at work, he becomes very agitated and irritable at the sounds ofloud noises in the factory, a behavior that is interfering with his productivity. Charles has been diagnosed withPosttraumatic Stress Disorder. The mental health nurse develops the following concept map care plan for Charles.

The development of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor(s) occurring within three months of the onset of the stressor(s). B. These symptoms or behaviors are clinically significant, as evidenced by one or both of the following: 1. Marked distress that is out of proportion to the severity or intensity of the stressor, taking into account the external context and the cultural factors that might influence symptom severity and presentation. 2. Significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. C. The stress-related disturbance does not meet the criteria for another mental disorder and is not merely an exacer-bation of a preexisting mental disorder. D. The symptoms do not represent normal bereavement.E. Once the stressor or its consequences have terminated, the symptoms do not persist for more than an additional6 months.Specify whether: With depressed mood: Low mood, tearfulness, or feelings of hopelessness are predominant. With anxiety: Nervousness, worry, jitteriness, or separation anxiety is predominant. With mixed anxiety and depressed mood: A combina- tion of depression and anxiety is predominant. With disturbance of conduct: Disturbance of conduct is predominant. With mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct: Both emotional symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) and adisturbance of conduct are predominant.

American Psychiatric Association. than what would be expected or considered to be a normative response to an identified stressor. Adjustment Disorder With Disturbance of Conduct This category is characterized by conduct in whichthere is violation of the rights of others or of majorage-appropriate societal norms and rules. Examplesinclude truancy, vandalism, reckless driving, fighting,and defaulting on legal responsibilities. Differentialdiagnosis must be made from conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder. Adjustment Disorder With Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct The predominant features of this category include emo- tional disturbances (e.g., anxiety or depression) as wellas disturbances of conduct in which there is violation ofthe rights of others or of major age-appropriate societalnorms and rules (e.g., truancy, vandalism, fighting). Adjustment Disorder Unspecified This subtype is used when the maladaptive reactionis not consistent with any of the other categories. Theindividual may have physical complaints, withdrawfrom relationships, or exhibit impaired work or aca-demic performance, but without significant distur-bance in emotions or conduct. Predisposing Factors to Adjustment Disorders Biological Theory Chronic disorders, such as neurocognitive disorder or intellectual disability, are thought to impair the abilityof an individual to adapt to stress, causing increasedvulnerability to adjustment disorder. Sadock andSadock (2007) suggest that genetic factors also mayinfluence individual risks for maladaptive response to stress. Psychosocial Theories Some proponents of psychoanalytic theory view adjust-ment disorder as a maladaptive response to stress that iscaused by early childhood trauma, increased depend-ency, and retarded ego development. Other psychoana-lysts put considerable weight on the constitutional factor,or birth characteristics that contribute to the manner inwhich individuals respond to stress. In many instances,adjustment disorder is precipitated by a specific mean-ingful stressor having found a point of vulnerability in anindividual of otherwise adequate ego strength. Some studies relate a predisposition to adjustment disorder to factors such as developmental stage, tim-ing of the stressor, and available support systems.When a stressor occurs, and the individual does nothave the developmental maturity, available supportsystems, or adequate coping strategies to adapt, nor-mal functioning is disrupted, resulting in psychologi-cal or somatic symptoms. The disorder also may berelated to a dysfunctional grieving process. The indi-vidual may remain in the denial or anger stage, withinadequate defense mechanisms to complete thegrieving process. Transactional Model of Stress/Adaptation Why are some individuals able to confront stressful situations adaptively and even gain strength from the4092_Ch28_559-580 24/07/14 5:31 PM Page 569experience, whereas others not only fail to cope adap- tively, but may even encounter psychopathological dysfunction? The Transactional Model of Stress/Adaptation takes into consideration the interaction between the individual and the environment. The type of stressor that one experiences may influ- ence one's adaptation. Sudden-shock stressors occurwithout warning, and continuous stressors are thosethat an individual is exposed to over an extended period. Although many studies have been directed to individuals' responses to sudden-shock stressors, it hasbeen found that continuous stressors were more com-monly cited than sudden-shock stressors as precipitantsto maladaptive functioning. Both situational and intrapersonal factors most likely contribute to an individual's stress response. Situational factors include personal and general eco-nomic conditions; occupational and recreational opportunities; and the availability of social supportssuch as family, friends, neighbors, and cultural or religious support groups. Intrapersonal factors such as constitutional vulner- ability have also been implicated in the predispositionto adjustment disorder. Some studies have indicatedthat a child with a difficult temperament (defined asone who cries loudly and often; adapts to changesslowly; and has irregular patterns of hunger, sleep, andelimination) is at greater risk of developing a behaviordisorder. Freud (1964) theorized that traumatic child-hood experiences created points of fixation to whichthe individual, during times of stress, would be likelyto regress. This might also apply to other unresolvedconflicts or developmental issues. Other intrapersonalfactors that might influence one's ability to adjust to a painful life change include social skills, copingstrategies, the presence of psychiatric illness, degreeof flexibility, and level of intelligence. Diagnosis/Outcome Identification Nursing diagnoses are formulated from the data gath-ered during the assessment phase and with backgroundknowledge regarding predisposing factors to the disor-der. Nursing diagnoses that may be used for the clientwith an adjustment disorder include: Complicated grieving related to real or perceivedloss of any concept of value to the individual, evi-denced by interference with life functioning, de-velopmental regression, or somatic complaints. Risk-prone health behavior related to change inhealth status requiring modification in lifestyle (e.g.,chronic illness, physical disability), evidenced by in-ability to problem-solve or set realistic goals for thefuture. NOTE: This diagnosis would be appropriate for the person with adjustment disorder if the pre-cipitating stressor was a change in health status.Anxiety (moderate to severe) related to situationaland/or maturational crisis evidenced by restless-ness, increased helplessness, and diminished pro-ductivity. Outcome Criteria The following criteria may be used for measurementof outcomes in the care of the client with an adjust-ment disorder. The client: Verbalizes acceptable behaviors associated witheach stage of the grief process Demonstrates a reinvestment in the environment Accomplishes activities of daily living independently Demonstrates ability for adequate occupationaland social functioning Verbalizes awareness of change in health status andthe effect it will have on lifestyle Solves problems and sets realistic goals for the future Demonstrates ability to cope effectively with changein lifestyle Planning/Implementation The following section presents a group of selectednursing diagnoses, with short- and long-term goalsand nursing interventions for each. Complicated Grieving Complicated grieving is defined as \"a disorder that occursafter the death of a significant other [or any other lossof significance to the individual], in which the experi-ence of distress accompanying bereavement fails to fol-low normative expectations and manifests in functionalimpairment\" (NANDA International [NANDA-I],2012, p. 365). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal By end of 1 week, client will express anger towardlost entity. Long-Term Goal The client will be able to verbalize behaviors asso-ciated with the normal stages of grief and identifyown position in grief process, while progressing atown pace toward resolution. Interventions Determine the stage of grief in which client isfixed. Identify behaviors associated with this stage.Accurate baseline assessment data are necessary toplan effective care for the grieving client.570 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch28_559-580 24/07/14 5:31 PM Page 570Develop a trusting relationship with the client. Show empathy and caring. Be honest and keep all promises. Trust is the basis for a therapeutic relationship. Convey an accepting attitude so that the client isnot afraid to express feelings openly. An acceptingattitude conveys to the client that you believe he orshe is a worthwhile person. Trust is enhanced. Allow the client to express anger. Do not becomedefensive if the initial expression of anger is dis-placed on the nurse or therapist. Help the client ex-plore angry feelings so that they may be directedtoward the intended object or person. Verbalizationof feelings in a nonthreatening environment mayhelp the client come to terms with unresolved issues. Assist the client to discharge pent-up anger throughparticipation in large motor activities (e.g., briskwalks, jogging, physical exercises, volleyball, punch-ing bag, exercise bike). Physical exercise provides asafe and effective method for discharging pent-uptension. Explain to the client the normal stages of grief andthe behaviors associated with each stage. Help theclient to understand that feelings such as guilt andanger toward the lost entity/concept are naturaland acceptable during the grief process. Knowl-edge of the acceptability of the feelings associatedwith normal grieving may help to relieve some ofthe guilt that these responses generate. Encourage the client to review his or her percep-tion of the loss or change. With support and sensi-tivity, point out the reality of the situation in areaswhere misrepresentations are expressed. The clientmust give up an idealized perception and be ableto accept both positive and negative aspects aboutthe painful life change before the grief process iscomplete. Communicate to the client that crying is acceptable.The use of touch is therapeutic and appropriatewith most clients. Knowledge of cultural influencesspecific to the client is important before employingthis technique. Touch is considered inappropriatein some cultures. Help the client to solve problems as he or she at-tempts to determine methods for more adaptivecoping with the stressor. Provide positive feedbackfor strategies identified and decisions made. Positivereinforcement enhances self-esteem and encour-ages repetition of desirable behaviors. Encourage the client to reach out for spiritual sup-port during this time in whatever form is desirable.Assess client's spiritual needs, and assist as necessaryin the fulfillment of those needs. For some individ-uals, spiritual support can enhance successful adap-tation to painful life experiences.Risk-Prone Health Behavior Risk-prone health behavior is defined as \"impaired abilityto modify lifestyle/behaviors in a manner that improveshealth status\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 155). Client Goals Short-Term Goals The client and primary nurse will discuss the kindsof lifestyle changes that will occur because of thechange in health status. With the help of the primary nurse, the client willformulate a plan of action for incorporating thosechanges into his or her lifestyle. The client will demonstrate movement toward independence, considering the change in healthstatus. Long-Term Goal The client will demonstrate competence to func-tion independently to his or her optimal ability,considering the change in health status, by the timeof discharge from treatment. Interventions Encourage the client to talk about his or her lifestyleprior to the change in health status. Discuss copingmechanisms that were used at stressful times in thepast. It is important to identify the client's strengthsso that they may be used to facilitate adaptation tothe change or loss that has occurred. Encourage the client to discuss the change or lossand particularly to express anger associated with it.Anger is a normal stage in the grieving process andif not released in an appropriate manner, may beturned inward on the self, leading to pathologicaldepression. Encourage the client to express fears associatedwith the change or loss or alteration in lifestyle thatit has created. Change often creates a feeling of dis-equilibrium and the individual may respond withfears that are irrational or unfounded. The clientmay benefit from feedback that corrects misper-ceptions about how life will be with the change inhealth status. Provide assistance with activities of daily living asrequired, but encourage independence to the limitthat client's ability will allow. Give positive feedbackfor activities accomplished independently. Inde-pendent accomplishments and positive feedbackenhance self-esteem and encourage repetition ofdesired behaviors. Successes also provide hope thatadaptive functioning is possible and decrease feel-ings of powerlessness. Help the client with decision making regarding incorporation of the change or loss into his or herCHAPTER 28 Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders 5714092_Ch28_559-580 24/07/14 5:31 PM Page 571lifestyle. Identify problems the change or loss is likely to create. Discuss alternative solutions, weighing po-tential benefits and consequences of each alterna-tive. Support the client's decision in the selection ofan alternative. The great amount of anxiety that usu-ally accompanies a major lifestyle change often in-terferes with an individual's ability to solve problemsand to make appropriate decisions. Client may needassistance with this process in an effort to progresstoward successful adaptation. Use role-play to practice stressful situations thatmight occur in relation to the health status change.Role-playing decreases anxiety and provides a feel-ing of security by providing the client with a planof action for responding in an appropriate mannerwhen a stressful situation occurs. Ensure that the client and family are fully knowledge-able regarding the physiology of the change inhealth status and understand the necessity of suchknowledge for optimal wellness. Encourage them toask questions, and provide printed material explain-ing the change to which they may refer. Havingknowledge about the health status and knowing whatto expect regarding the change or loss decreases anx-iety and enhances the capacity for wellness. Ensure that the client can identify resources withinthe community from which he or she may seek as-sistance in adapting to the change in health status.Examples include self-help or support groups andpublic health nurse, counselor, or social worker.Encourage the client to keep follow-up appoint-ments with his or her physician, or to call the physi-cian's office prior to the follow-up date if problemsor concerns arise. Support services provide a feel-ing of security that one is not alone and provide a means to prevent decompensation when stress becomes intolerable. Concept Care Mapping An example of a concept map care plan for a client withan adjustment disorder is presented in Figure 28-2. Evaluation Reassessment is conducted to determine if the nurs-ing actions have been successful in achieving the ob-jectives of care. Evaluation of the nursing actions forthe client with an adjustment disorder may be facili-tated by gathering information using the followingtypes of questions: Does the client verbalize understanding of the griefprocess and his or her position in the process? Does the client recognize his or her adaptive and maladaptive behaviors associated with the griefresponse?Does the client demonstrate evidence of progres-sion along the grief response? Can the client accomplish activities of daily livingindependently? Does the client demonstrate the ability to performoccupational and social activities adequately? Does the client discuss the change in health statusand modification of lifestyle it will affect? Does the client demonstrate acceptance of themodification? Can the client participate in decision making andproblem-solving for his or her future? Does the client set realistic goals for the future? Does the client demonstrate new adaptive copingstrategies for dealing with the change in lifestyle? Can the client verbalize available resources to whomhe or she may go for support or assistance should itbe necessary? Treatment Modalities Trauma-Related Disorders Cognitive Therapy Cognitive therapy for PTSD and ASD strives to help the individual recognize and modify trauma-relatedthoughts and beliefs. The individual learns to modifythe relationships between thoughts and feelings, and toidentify and challenge inaccurate or extreme automaticnegative thoughts. The goal is to replace these negativethoughts with more accurate and less distressingthoughts, and to cope more effectively with feelings suchas anger, guilt, and fear. The individual is assisted tomodify the appraisal of self and the world as it has beenaffected by the trauma, and to regain hope and opti-mism about safety, trust, power and control, esteem, andintimacy. Prolonged Exposure Therapy Prolonged exposure therapy (PE) is a type of behav-ioral therapy somewhat similar to implosion therapy orflooding (see Chapter 27). It can be conducted in animagined or real (in vivo) situation. In the imaginedsituation, the individual is exposed to repeated andprolonged mental recounting of the traumatic experi-ence. In vivo exposure involves systematic confronta-tion, within safe limits, of trauma-related situations thatare feared and avoided. This intense emotional pro-cessing of the traumatic event serves to neutralize thememories so that they no longer result in anxiousarousal or escape and avoidance behaviors. PE has four main parts: (1) education about the treatment,(2) breathing retraining for relaxation, (3) imaginedexposure through repeated discussion about the572 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch28_559-580 24/07/14 5:31 PM Page 572trauma with a therapist, and (4) exposure to real-world situations related to the trauma. Group/Family Therapy Group therapy has been strongly advocated for clientswith PTSD. It has proved especially effective with mil-itary veterans (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). The impor-tance of being able to share their experiences withempathetic fellow veterans, to talk about problems insocial adaptation, and to discuss options for manag-ing their aggression toward others has been empha-sized. Some PTSD groups are informal and leaderless,such as self-help or support groups, and some are ledby experienced group therapists who may have hadsome firsthand experience with the trauma. Somegroups involve family members, thereby recognizingCHAPTER 28 Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders 573 Clinical Vignette: Hanna, age 16, has just been diagnosed with Celiac Disease and has been placed on a gluten-free diet.

Hollander and Simeon (2008) state: Because of past experiences, [clients with PTSD] are often mistrustful and reluctant to depend on author-ity figures, whereas the identification, support, andhopefulness of peer settings can facilitate therapeuticchange. (p. 579) Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a type of psychotherapy that was devel-oped in 1989 by psychologist Francine Shapiro. It\"has evolved from a simple technique into an integra-tive psychotherapy approach with a theoretical modelthat emphasizes the brain's information processingsystem and memories of disturbing experiences as thebasis of pathology\" (Shapiro, 2007, p. 3). EMDR hasbeen shown to be an effective therapy for PTSD andother trauma-related disorders. It has been used withother disorders, including depression, adjustment dis-order, phobias, addictions, generalized anxiety disor-der, and panic disorder. However, at present, EMDRhas been empirically validated only for trauma-relateddisorders such as PTSD and acute stress disorder(Aetna Healthcare, 2013). EMDR is contraindicatedin clients who have neurological impairments (e.g.,seizure disorders), clients who are suicidal or experi-encing psychosis, those with severe dissociative disor-ders or unstable substance abuse, and those withdetached retina or glaucoma (Center for IntegrativeMedicine, 2013). The exact biological mechanisms by which EMDR achieves its therapeutic effects are unknown. Somestudies have indicated that eye movements cause a de-crease in imagery vividness and distress, as well as anincrease in memory access. The process, which in-volves rapid eye movements while processing painfulemotions, is thought to \"relieve the anxiety associatedwith the trauma so that the original event can be ex-amined from a more detached perspective, somewhatlike watching a movie of what happened\" (Bartson,Smith, & Corcoran, 2011). While concentrating on aparticular emotion or physical sensation surroundingthe traumatic event, the client is asked to focus his orher eye movements on the therapist's fingers as thetherapist moves them from left to right and backagain. Although some individuals report rapid resultswith this therapy, research has indicated that from 5 to 12 sessions are required to achieve lasting treat-ment effects. The EMDR treatment encompasses thefollowing eight-phase process. Phase 1: History and treatment planning In the first phase, the therapist takes a thorough history and de- velops a treatment plan. The problem for which the client is seeking treatment and current symptoms arediscussed. However, the client is not required to discuss the traumatic event in detail, unless he or she chooses to do so. Instead, emphasis is placed onthe emotions and physical sensations surrounding thetraumatic event. Phase 2: Preparation During this phase, the therapist teaches the client certain self-care techniques (e.g., relaxation techniques) for dealing with emotional dis-turbances that may arise during or between sessions.Self-care is an important component of EMDR. It isimportant for the client to develop a sense of trust inthe therapist during this phase. Phase 3: Assessment During this phase, the therapist asks the client to identify a specific scene or picture from the target event identified in phase 1 that best repre-sents the memory . The client is then directed to express a negative self-belief associated with the memory (e.g.,\"I am bad\" or \"I'm in danger\"). The next step is to iden-tify a self-statement that he or she would rather believe (e.g., \"I am good\" or \"I'm safe now\"). When the self-statements have been identified, the client is asked torate the validity of each of the statements on the Validityof Cognition (VOC) scale from \"completely false\" (ascore of 1) to \"completely true\" (a score of 7). In thisphase, the client is also asked to rank the disturbingemotions on the zero to 10 Subjective Units of Distur-bance (SUD) scale (with zero meaning the disturbanceis not disturbing at all and 10 meaning it is the worstfeeling he or she has ever had). Phase 4: Densensitization During this phase, the client gives attention to the negative beliefs and disturbing emotions associated with the traumatic event while fo-cusing his or her vision on the back-and-forth motionof the therapist's finger . All personal feelings and physical reactions experienced during this time arenoted. Following each set of rapid eye movements,the therapist reassesses the level of disturbance asso-ciated with the feelings, images, and beliefs. This desensitization process continues until the distresslevel (as measured by the SUD scale) is reduced tozero or 1. Phase 5: Installation In phase 5, the client gives attention to the positive belief that he or she has identified to re- place the negative belief associated with the trauma.This is accomplished while simultaneously visuallytr acking the therapist's finger. Following each set of rapid eye movements, the client is asked to rate the pos-itive belief on the VOC scale. The goal is to strengthenthe positive belief or self-statement until it is acceptedas completely true (a score of 7 on the VOC scale). Phase 6: Body scan When the positive cognition has been strengthened, the therapist asks the client to concentrate on any lingering physical sensations.574 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch28_559-580 24/07/14 5:31 PM Page 574While focusing on the traumatic event, the client is asked to identify any areas of the body where residualtension is experienced. Because positive self-beliefsmust be believed on more than just an intellectuallevel, phase 6 is not complete until the client is able tothink about or discuss the traumatic event (or the feel-ings associated with it) without experiencing bodilytension. Phase 7: Closure Closure ensures that the client leaves each session feeling better than he or she felt at the beginning. If the processing that took place duringthe session is not complete, the therapist will directthe client through a variety of self-calming relaxationtechniques to help him or her regain emotional equi-librium. The client is briefed about what to expect be-tween sessions. Until processing of the trauma iscomplete, disturbing images, thoughts, and emotionsmay arise between therapy sessions. The therapist instructs the client to record these experiences in ajournal so that they may be used as targets for pro-cessing in future therapy sessions. Phase 8: Reevaluation Reevaluation begins each new therapy session. The therapist assesses whether the positive changes have been maintained, determinesif previous target areas need reprocessing, and iden-tifies any new target areas that need attention. Clients often feel relief quite rapidly with EMDR. However, to achieve lasting results, it is important that each of the eight phases be completed. Treatment isnot complete until \"EMDR therapy has focused onthe past memories that are contributing to the prob-lem, the present situations that are disturbing, andwhat skills the client may need for the future\" (EMDRNetwork, Psychopharmacology Antidepressants The considered first-line treat-ment choice for PTSD because of their efficacy, tolerability , and safety ratings (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Paroxetine and sertraline have been approvedby the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for thispurpose. The tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitripty-line and imipramine), the MAO inhibitors (e.g.,phenelzine), and trazodone have also been effectivein the treatment of PTSD. Anxiolytics Alprazolam has been prescribed for PTSD clients for its antidepressant and antipanic effects. Other benzodiazepines have also been used, despitethe absence of controlled studies demonstrating theirefficacy in PTSD. Their addictive properties makethem less desirable than some of the other medica-tions in the treatment of post-trauma patients. Bus-pirone, which has serotonergic properties similar tothe SSRIs, may also be useful. Further controlled trialswi th this drug are needed to validate its efficacy in treating PTSD. Antihypertensives The beta blocker propranolol and alpha2-receptor agonist clonidine have been success- ful in alleviating some of the symptoms associated with PTSD. In clinical trials, marked reductions innightmares, intrusive recollections, hypervigilance,insomnia, startle responses, and angry outbursts werereported with the use of these drugs (Hollander &Simeon, 2008). Other Medications Carbamazepine, valproic acid, and lithium carbonate have been reported to alleviate symptoms of intrusive recollections, flashbacks, night-mares, impulsivity, irritability , and violent clients. Sadock and Sadock (2007) report thatlittle positive evidence exists concerning the use ofantipsychotics in PTSD. They suggest that these drugs\"should be reserved for the short-term control of severe aggression and agitation\" (p. 621). Adjustment Disorders Various treatments are used for clients with adjust-ment disorder. Strain, Klipstein, and Newcorn (2008)cite the following as major goals of therapy for theseindividuals: 1.To relieve symptoms associated with a stressor. 2. To enhance coping with stressors that cannot bereduced or removed. 3. To establish support systems that maximize adaptation. Individual Psychotherapy Individual psychotherapy is the most common treat-ment for adjustment disorder. Individual psychotherapyallows the client to examine the stressor that is causingthe problem, possibly assign personal meaning to thestressor, and confront unresolved issues that may be exacerbating this crisis. Treatment works to removethese blocks to adaptation so that normal developmen-tal progression can resume. Techniques are used toclarify links between the current stressor and past expe-riences, and to assist with the development of moreadaptive coping strategies. Family Therapy The focus of treatment is shifted from the individualto the system of relationships in which the individualis involved. The maladaptive response of the identi-fied client is viewed as symptomatic of a dysfunctionalfamily system. All family members are included in thetherapy, and treatment serves to improve the func-tioning within the family network. Emphasis is placedon communication, family rules, and interaction pat-terns among the family members.CHAPTER 28 Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders 5754092_Ch28_559-580 24/07/14 5:31 PM Page 575Behavior Therapy The goal of behavior therapy is to replace ineffective response patterns with more adaptive ones. The situ-ations that promote ineffective responses are identi-fied, and carefully designed reinforcement schedules,along with role-playing and coaching, are used toalter the maladaptive response patterns. This type oftreatment is very effective when implemented in aninpatient setting where the client's behavior and itsconsequences may be more readily controlled. Self-Help Groups Group experiences, with or without a professional fa-cilitator, provide an arena in which members may con-sider and compare their responses to individuals withsimilar life experiences. Members benefit from learn-ing that they are not alone in their painful experi-ences. Hope is derived from knowing that others havesurvived and even grown from similar experiences.Members of the group exchange advice, share copingstrategies, and provide support and encouragementfor each other. Crisis Intervention In crisis intervention the therapist, or other intervener,becomes a part of the individual's life situation. Because of increased anxiety, the individual with ad-justment disorder is unable to problem-solve, so he orshe requires guidance and support from another tohelp mobilize the resources needed to resolve the cri-sis. Crisis intervention is short-term, and relies heavilyon orderly problem-solving techniques and structuredactivities that are focused on change. The ultimate goalof crisis intervention in the treatment of adjustmentdisorder is to resolve the immediate crisis, restore adap-tive functioning, and promote personal growth. Psychopharmacology Adjustment disorder is not commonly treated with med-ications, for the following reasons: (1) their effect maybe temporary and only mask the real problem, interfer-ing with the possibility of finding a more permanent so-lution, and (2) psychoactive drugs carry the potentialfor physiological and psychological dependence. When the client with adjustment disorder has symptoms of anxiety or depression, the physician mayprescribe antianxiety or antidepressant medication.These medications are considered only adjuncts topsychotherapy and should not be given as the primarytherapy. In these instances they are given to alleviatesymptoms so that the individual may more effectivelycope while attempting to adapt to the stressful situation.576 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation CASE STUDY AND SAMPLE CARE PLAN NURSING HISTORY AND ASSESSMENT Linda, age 22, was born in a small town in Oklahoma. She lived there her whole life, even living at home while sheattended a nearby college to earn a baccalaureate degreein education. She is an only child, and her parents were intheir 40s when she was born. She was engaged through-out her college years to her high school sweetheart, Tony,who graduated 6 months ago from the state university witha degree in aeronautical engineering. Upon his graduation,he accepted a position with NASA at Kennedy Space Cen-ter in Florida. Linda and Tony were married 5 months agoand moved to a small apartment in Cape Canaveral, whereTony began his work with NASA. The plan was for Linda toseek employment upon their arrival, but she has been un-able to move ahead with those plans. She stays in theapartment most days, talking on the phone to her parents,and crying about how much she misses them and herhome in Oklahoma. She has met very few people, and hasno desire to do so. She sleeps a lot and has lost weight.She has been having severe headaches. Her husband hasbecome very concerned about her, and made an appoint-ment for her with a private physician. Following a completeand unremarkable physical examination, the physician re-ferred Linda to the mental health clinic where she was ad-mitted to the Day Treatment Center with a diagnosis ofadjustment disorder with depressed mood.NURSING DIAGNOSES/OUTCOME IDENTIFICATION From the assessment data, the nurse develops the following nursing diagnoses for Linda: 1.Complicated grieving related to feelings of loss associ- ated with leaving her parents and her lifetime home. a.Short- Term Goal: Within 1 week, Linda will express anger about the loss associated with her move. b.Long-Term Goal: Linda will be able to verbalize be- haviors associated with the normal stages of grief andidentify her own position in the grief process, while pro-gressing at her own pace toward resolution. 2.Relocation stress syndrome related to move away from parents and familiar environment in which she had spenther whole life. a.Short- Term Goal: Within 1 week, Linda will verbalize at least one positive aspect regarding relocation to hernew environment. b.Long-Term Goal: Within 1 month, Linda will demon- strate positive adaptation to her new environment asevidenced by involvement in activities, expression ofsatisfaction with new acquaintances, and eliminationof previously evident physical and psychological symp-toms associated with the relocation. 4092_Ch28_559-580 24/07/14 5:31 PM Page 576Summary and Key Points Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the develop- ment of characteristic symptoms following exposureto an extreme traumatic stressor involving a per-sonal threat to physical integrity or to the integrityof others. Symptoms may begin within the first 3 months after the trauma, or there may be a delayof several months or even years. The symptoms of PTSD are associated with eventsthat would be markedly distressing to almost any-one, and include reexperiencing the trauma, a sus-tained high level of anxiety or arousal, or a generalnumbing of responsiveness. A disorder that is similar in terms of precipitatingtraumatic events and symptomatology to PTSD is called acute stress disorder (ASD). In ASD, thesymptoms are time limited, up to 1 month followingthe trauma. If the symptoms last longer than 1 month, the diagnosis would be PTSD. Predisposing factors to trauma-related disorders include psychosocial, learning, cognitive, and bio-logical influences. Adjustment disorders are relatively common. Infact, some studies indicate they are the most com-monly ascribed psychiatric diagnoses. Clinical symptoms associated with adjustment disorders include inability to function socially or oc-cupationally in response to an identifiable stressor. Adjustment disorder is distinguished by the predom-inant features of the maladaptive response. These include depression, anxiety, mixed anxiety and depression, disturbance of conduct, and mixed dis-turbance of emotions and conduct. Of the two types of stressors discussed (i.e., sudden-shock and continuous), more individuals respondCHAPTER 28 Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders 577 C A S E S T U D Y A N D S A M P L E C A R E P L A N\u2014cont'd PLANNING/IMPLEMENTATION COMPLICATED GRIEVING The following nursing interventions have been identified for Linda: 1.Determine the stage of grief in which Linda is fixed. Identify behaviors associated with this stage. 2.Develop a trusting relationship with Linda. Show empa-thy and caring. Be honest and keep all promises. 3.Convey an accepting attitude so that Linda is not afraidto express her feelings openly . 4.Allow Linda to express her anger . Do not become defensive if the initial expression of anger is displacedon nurse or therapist. Help Linda explore ang ry feelings so that they may be directed toward the intended object or situation. 5.Help Linda discharge pent-up anger through participa-tion in large motor activities (e.g., brisk walks, jogg ing, physical exercises, or activity of her choice). 6.Explain to Linda the normal stages of g rief and the behaviors associated with each stage. Help her to un-derstand that these feelings are normal and acceptableduring a g rief process. 7.Encourage Linda to review her personal perception ofthe move. W ith suppor t and sensitivity, point out the re- ality of the situation in areas where misrepresentationsare expressed. 8.Help Linda solve problems as she attempts to determinemethods for more adaptive coping with the life change.Provide positive feedback for strateg ies identified and decisions made. 9.Encourage Linda to reach out for spiritual support during this time in whatever form is desirable to her . Assess her spiritual needs and assist as necessary in thefulfillment of those needs.RELOCATION STRESS SYNDROME The following nursing interventions have been identified forLinda: 1.Encourage Linda to discuss feelings (concerns, fears, anger) regarding this relocation. 2.Encourage Linda to discuss how the change will affecther life. Ensure that Linda is involved in decision makingand problem-solving regarding the move. 3.Help Linda identify positive aspects about the move. 4.Help Linda identify resources within the new communityfrom which assistance with various types of services maybe obtained. 5.Identify groups within the community that specialize inhelping individuals adapt to relocation. Examples includeNewcomers' Club, W elcome W agon International, and school and church organizations. 6.Refer Linda to a support group (e.g., Depression andBipolar Suppor t Alliance [DB SA]). EVALUATION The outcome criteria for Linda have been met. She is no longerhaving headaches, and she has regained some of her weight.She has joined a chapter of DBSA, and has made some newacquaintances. She has applied to become a substitute teacherin the local school district, and she and Tony have joined thelocal Methodist church, where they have started to socializewith several couples their age. They have also adopted Molly,a 2-year-old mutt from the local shelter, who showers Lindawith love and keeps her company when no one else is around.They take daily walks together. Linda still talks to her parentson the phone daily, but no longer has feelings of despair aboutliving so far away from them. Her parents provide encourage-ment and give her positive feedback for achieving a satisfactoryadaptation to her new environment. They are planning a visitto see Linda and Tony in the near future. 4092_Ch28_559-580 24/07/14 5:31 PM Page 577with maladaptive behaviors to ous stressors. Treatment modalities for PTSD include cognitivetherapy, prolonged exposure therapy, group/familytherapy, desensitization and repro-cessing (EMDR), and psychopharmacology. Treatment modalities for adjustment disorders include individual psychotherapy, family therapy,behavior therapy, self-help groups, crisis interven-tion, and medications to treat anxiety or depression. Nursing care of individuals with trauma- and stres-sor-related disorders is accomplished using thesteps of the nursing process.578 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation Additional info available at www.davisplus.com Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT Please read the chapter and answer the following questions: 1.Past experience with serious or life-threatening physical illness, either personal or that of aclose family member, can predispose an indi- vidual to what somatic symptom disorder? 2.In an individual with dissociative identity disorder , what most commonly precipitates transition from one personality to another?3.Conversion symptoms most commonlyoccur in an individual for what reason? 4.Somatic symptom and dissociative disor-ders disorders are characterized by phys- ical symptoms suggesting medical disease, but withoutdemonstrable organic pathology or known pathophys-iological mechanism to account for them. They areclassified as mental disorders because pathophysiolog-ical processes are not demonstrable or understandableby existing laboratory procedures, and there is eitherevidence or strong presumption that psychological fac-tors are the major cause of the symptoms. It is now welldocumented that a large proportion of clients in gen-eral medical outpatient clinics and private medical of-fices do not have organic disease requiring medicaltreatment. It is likely that many of these clients have somatic symptom disorders, but they do not perceivethemselves as having a psychiatric problem and thusdo not seek treatment from psychiatrists. Dissociative disorders are defined by a disturbance of or alteration in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, and identity (Black & Andreasen, 2011). Dissociative responses occur whenanxiety becomes overwhelming and the personalitybecomes disorganized. Defense mechanisms that nor-mally govern consciousness, identity, and memorybreak down, and behavior occurs with little or no par-ticipation on the part of the conscious personality.Types of dissociative disorders described by the Diag-nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) : Depersonalization-derealization disorder Dissociative amnesia Dissociative identity disorder Other specified dissociative disorder Unspecified dissociative disorder This chapter focuses on disorders characterized by severe anxiety that has been repressed and is being ex-pressed in the form of physiological symptoms and dis-sociative behaviors. Historical and epidemiologicalstatistics are presented. Predisposing factors that havebeen implicated in the etiology of these responses pro-vide a framework for studying the dynamics of somaticsymptom and dissociative disorders. An explanation ofthe symptomatology of these disorders is presented asbackground knowledge for assessing the client, andnursing care is described in the context of the nursingprocess. Additional treatment modalities are explored. Historical AspectsHistorically, somatic symptom disorders were identifiedas hysterical neuroses. The concept of hysteria is at least 4,000 years old and probably originated in Egypt. Thename has been in use since the time of Hippocrates. Over the years, symptoms of hysterical neuroses have been associated with witchcraft, demonology,and sorcery; dysfunction of the nervous system; andunexpressed emotion. Somatic symptom disordersare thought to occur in response to repressed severeanxiety. Freud observed that, under hypnosis, clientswith hysterical neurosis could recall past memoriesand emotional experiences that would relieve theirsymptoms. This led to his proposal that unexpressedemotion can be \"converted\" into physical symptoms.582 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation Freud (1962) viewed dissociation as a type of repression, an active defense mechanism used to remove threatening or unacceptable mental contentsfrom conscious awareness. He also described the de-fense of splitting of the ego in the management of in-compatible mental contents. Despite the fact that thestudy of dissociative processes dates back to the 19thcentury, scientists still know remarkably little aboutthe phenomena. Questions still devices? Are uncon-scious effort? Maldonado and Spiegel (2008) state: [These disorders] have much to teach us about the way humans adapt to traumatic stress, and about information processing in the brain. (p. 665) The syndrome of fabricating symptoms for emo- tional gain was first described by Richard Asher in 1951 in an article in The Lancet. He described a pat-tern of behavior in which individuals fabricated orembellished their histories and signs and symptomsof illness. He termed this condition Munchausen syn- drome after Baron Friedrich Hieronymus Freiherr von Munchhausen, a German cavalry officer and no-bleman, who was known for his fabricated stories andfanciful exaggerations about himself (Asher, 1951). Epidemiological Statistics The prevalence of somatic symptom disorder isthought to be about 5 to 7 percent in the general CORE CONCEPT Hysteria A polysymptomatic disorder that usually begins in ado- lescence (rarely after the 20s), chiefly affects women,and is characterized by recurrent multiple somatic com-plaints that are unexplained by organic pathology. It isthought to be associated with repressed anxiety. CORE CONCEPT Dissociation The splitting off of clusters of mental contents from conscious awareness, a mechanism central to hysteri-cal conversion and dissociative disorder (Shahrokh &Hales, 2003). 4092_Ch29_581-607 23/07/14 12:37 PM Page 582population (APA, 2013). It is more common in women than in men, in rural areas, and in less edu-cated persons (Black & Andreasen, 2011). Lifetime prevalence rates of conversion disorder vary widely. Statistics within the general populationhave ranged from 5 to 30 percent. The disorder oc-curs more frequently in women than in men andmore frequently in adolescents and young adults thanin other age groups. A higher prevalence exists inlower socioeconomic groups, rural populations, andamong those with less education (Black & Andreasen,2011; Sadock & Sadock, 2007). The disorder previously known as hypochondriasis (fear of having a serious disease) affects 1 to 5 percentof the general population. The disorder is equally com-mon among men and women, and onset most com-monly occurs in early adulthood. This disorder, whichappeared in the DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000), no longer ap- pears as such in the DSM-5. Rationale for the change was that about 75 percent of individuals with hypochon-driasis fall into a subgroup in which somatic symptomsare the primary complaint. The other 25 percent fallinto a subgroup in which there are minimal or no so-matic complaints, but who present with intense anxietyand suspiciousness of the presence of an undiagnosed,serious medical illness (APA, 2013). Therefore, the 75 percent of individuals with somatic symptoms areconsidered to have somatic symptom disorder, andthose with minimal or no somatic symptoms would bediagnosed with illness anxiety disorder, a diagnosis newto the DSM-5. The diagnosis previously known as paindisorder has also been subsumed under the diagnosisof somatic symptom disorder. Body dysmorphic disor-der is now a category under the Obsessive-Compulsiveand Related Disorders classification. Data on the prevalence of factitious disorder (dis- cussed later in the chapter) is limited and frequencyof the disorder is unknown. Estimates suggest that in-dividuals with factitious disorder may comprise about0.8 to 1.0 percent of psychiatric consultation clients(Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Dissociative syndromes are statistically quite rare, but when they do occur they may present very dra-matic clinical pictures of severe disturbances in nor-mal personality functioning. Dissociative amnesia isrelatively rare, occurring most frequently under con-ditions of war or during natural disasters. However, inrecent years, there has been an increase in the num-ber of reported cases, possibly attributed to increasedawareness of the phenomenon, and identification ofcases that were previously undiagnosed. It appears tobe equally common in men and women. Dissociativeamnesia can occur at any age but is difficult to diag-nose in children because it is easily confused withinattention or oppositional behavior.Estimates of the prevalence of dissociative identity disorder (DID) vary widely. Historically, it was thoughtto be quite rare; however, the number of reportedcases has grown rapidly in the past few decades. Thedisorder occurs from five to nine times more fre-quently in women than in men (Sadock & Sadock,2007). Onset likely occurs in childhood, althoughmanifestations of the disorder may not be recognizeduntil much later. Clinical symptoms usually are notrecognized until late adolescence or early adulthood,although they have probably existed for a number ofyears prior to diagnosis. There appears to be some ev-idence that the disorder is more common in first-degree biological relatives of people with the disorderthan in the general population. The prevalence of severe episodes of depersonalization- derealization disorder is unknown. It is thought thatsingle brief episodes may occur at some time in as many as half of all adults, particularly when undersevere psychosocial stress, when sleep deprived, duringtravel to unfamiliar places, or when intoxicated with hallucinogens, marijuana, or alcohol (Black & Andreasen, 2011). Symptoms usually begin in adoles-cence or early adulthood. The disorder is chronic, withperiods of remission and exacerbation. The incidenceof depersonalization-derealization disorder is highunder conditions of sustained traumatization, such as in military combat or prisoner-of-war camps. It has also been reported in many individuals who endurenear-death experiences. Application of the Nursing Process Background Assessment Data: Types of Somatic Symptom Disorders Somatic Symptom Disorder Somatic symptom disorder is a syndrome of multiple somatic symptoms that cannot be explained medicallyand are associated with psychosocial distress and long-term seeking of assistance from health-care profes-sionals. Symptoms may be vague, dramatized, orexaggerated in their presentation, and an excessiveamount of time and energy is devoted to worry andconcern about the symptoms. Individuals with so-matic symptom disorder are so totally convinced thattheir symptoms are related to organic pathology thatthey adamantly reject, and are often irritated by, anyimplication that stress or psychosocial factors play anyrole in their condition. The disorder is chronic, withsymptoms beginning before age 30. Anxiety and depression are frequently manifested, and suicidalthreats and attempts are not uncommon. The disorder usually runs a fluctuating course, with periods of remission and exacerbation. ClientsCHAPTER 29 Somatic Symptom and Dissociative Disorders 5834092_Ch29_581-607 23/07/14 12:37 PM Page 583often receive medical care from several physicians, sometimes concurrently, leading to the possibility ofdangerous combinations of treatments. They have atendency to seek relief through overmedicating withprescribed analgesics or antianxiety agents. Drugabuse and dependence are common complications ofsomatic symptom disorder. When suicide results, it isusually in association with substance abuse (Sadock &Sadock, 2007). It has been suggested that, in somatic symptom dis- order, there may be some overlapping of personalitycharacteristics and features associated with histrionicpersonality disorder. These symptoms include height-ened emotionality, impressionistic thought and speech,seductiveness, strong dependency needs, and a preoc-cupation with symptoms and oneself. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for somatic symptom disorder are presented in Box 29-1. Illness Anxiety Disorder Illness anxiety disorder may be defined as an unreal-istic or inaccurate interpretation of physical symp-toms or sensations, leading to preoccupation and fearof having a serious disease. The fear becomes dis-abling and persists despite appropriate reassurancethat no organic pathology can be detected. Symptomsmay be minimal or absent, but the individual is highlyanxious about and suspicious of the presence of anundiagnosed, serious medical illness (APA, 2013). Individuals with illness anxiety disorder are ex- tremely conscious of bodily sensations and changes,and may become convinced that a rapid heart rate indicates they have heart disease or that a small soreis skin cancer. They are profoundly preoccupied withtheir bodies and are totally aware of even the slightestchange in feeling or sensation. Their response tothese small changes, however, is usually unrealisticand exaggerated. Some individuals with illness anxiety disorder have a long history of \"doctor shopping\" and are convincedthat they are not receiving the proper care. Othersavoid seeking medical assistance because to do sowould increase their anxiety to intolerable levels. De-pression is common, and obsessive-compulsive traitsfrequently accompany the disorder. Preoccupationwith the fear of serious disease may interfere with socialor occupational functioning. Some individuals are ableto function appropriately on the job, however, whilelimiting their physical complaints to non-work time. Individuals with illness anxiety disorder are so apprehensive and fearful that they become alarmedat the slightest intimation of serious illness. Even read-ing about a disease or hearing that someone theyknow has been diagnosed with an illness precipitatesalarm on their part. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for illness anxiety disorder are presented in Box 29-2. Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder) Conversion disorder is a loss of or change in body func- tion that cannot be explained by any known medical dis-order or pathophysiological mechanism. There is mostlikely a psychological component involved in the initia-tion, exacerbation, or perpetuation of the symptom, although it may or may not be obvious or identifiable.584 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation BOX 29-1 Diagnostic Criteria for Somatic Symptom Disorder A. One or more somatic symptoms that are distressing or result in significant disruption in daily life. B. Excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated health concerns as manifested by at least one of the following: 1. Disproportionate and persistent thoughts about the seriousness of one's symptoms. 2. Persistently high level of anxiety about health or symptoms. 3. Excessive time and energy devoted to these symptoms or health concerns. C. Although any one symptom may not be continuously present, the state of being symptomatic is persistent (typically more than 6 months).

American Psychiatric Association.4092_Ch29_581-607 23/07/14 12:37 PM Page 584Conversion symptoms affect voluntary motor or sensory functioning suggestive of neurological dis- ease. Examples include paralysis, aphonia (inability to produce voice), seizures, coordination disturbance,difficulty swallowing, urinary retention, akinesia,blindness, deafness, double vision, anosmia (inability to perceive smell), loss of pain sensation, and hallu-cinations. Pseudocyesis (false pregnancy) is a conver- sion symptom and may represent a strong desire tobe pregnant. Previous criteria in the DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000) stated that the precipitation of conversion symptomsmust be explained by psychological factors. This cri-terion has been removed in the DSM-5, which states, \"The potential etiological relevance of stress ortrauma may be suggested by a close temporal relation-ship. However, while assessment for stress and traumais important, the diagnosis should not be withheld ifnone is found\" (APA, 2013, pp. 319-320). It is likelythat multiple causes play a role in the etiology. Most symptoms of conversion disorder resolve within a few weeks. About 20 percent of individuals with thediagnosis have a relapse within 1 year. Black and An-dreasen (2011) state, \"A favorable outcome is generallyassociated with acute onset, a precipitating stressfulevent, good premorbid adjustment, and the absence ofmedical or neurological comorbidity\" (p. 216). The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for conversion dis- order are presented in Box 29-3. Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions Psychological factors may play a role in virtually any medical condition. In this disorder, it is evidentthat psychological or behavioral factors have been implicated in the development, exacerbation, or de-layed recovery from a medical condition. Historically,mind and body have been viewed as two distinct enti-ties, each subject to different laws of causality. Indeed,in many instances\u2014particularly in highly specializedareas of medicine\u2014the biological and psychologicalcomponents of disease remain separate. However,medical research shows that a change is occurring.Research associated with biological functioning isbeing expanded to include the psychological and social determinants of health and disease. This psy-chobiological approach to illness reflects a more ho-listic perspective and one that promotes concern forhelping clients achieve optimal functioning. With this diagnosis, there is objective evidence of a general medical condition that has been precipi-tated by or is being perpetuated by psychological orbehavioral circumstances. The DSM-5 diagnostic cri- teria for psychological factors affecting other medicalconditions are presented in Box 29-4. Factitious Disorder Factitious disorder involves conscious, intentionalfeigning of physical or psychological symptoms (Black& Andreasen, 2011). Individuals with factitious disor-der pretend to be ill in order to receive emotionalcare and support commonly associated with the roleof \"patient.\" Even though the behaviors are deliberateand intentional, there may be an associated compul-sive element that diminishes personal control. Indi-viduals may aggravate existing symptoms, induce newones, or even inflict painful injuries on themselves(Sadock & Sadock, 2007). The disorder may also beidentified as Munchausen syndrome , and symptoms may be psychological, physical, or a combination of both.CHAPTER 29 Somatic Symptom and Dissociative Disorders 585 BOX 29-2 Diagnostic Criteria for Illness Anxiety Disorder A. Preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness. B. Somatic symptoms are not present or, if present, are only mild in intensity. If another medical condition is present or there is a high risk for developing a medical condition (e.g., strong family history is present), the preoccupation is clearlyexcessive or disproportionate. C. There is a high level of anxiety about health, and the individual is easily alarmed about personal health status.D. The individual performs excessive health-related behaviors (e.g., repeatedly checks his or her body for signs of illness) or exhibits maladaptive avoidance (e.g., avoids doctors' appointments and hospitals). E. Illness preoccupation has been present for at least 6 months, but the specific illness that is feared may change over that period of time. F. The illness-related preoccupation is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as somatic symptom disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or delusional disorder, somatic type.

A medical symptom or condition (other than a mental disorder) is present.B. Psychological or behavioral factors adversely affect the general medical condition in one of the following ways: 1. The factors have influenced the course of the medical condition as shown by a close temporal association between the psychological factors and the development or exacerbation of, or delayed recovery from, the medical condition. 2. The factors interfere with the treatment of the medical condition (e.g., poor adherence). 3. The factors constitute additional well-established health risks for the individual. 4.

American Psychiatric Association. The disorder may be imposed on oneself, or on another person (previously called factitious disorder by proxy ). In the latter case, physical symptoms are inten- tionally imposed on a person under the care of the per- petrator. Diagnosis of factitious disorder can be verydifficult, as individuals become very inventive in theirquest to produce symptoms. Examples include self-inflicted wounds, injection or insertion of contami-nated substances, manipulating a thermometer to feigna fever, urinary tract manipulation, and surreptitioususe of medications (Black & Andreasen, 2011, p. 236).The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for factitious disor- der are presented in Box 29-5. Predisposing Factors Associated With Somatic Symptom Disorders Genetic Studies have shown an increased incidence of so- matic symptom disorder, conversion disorder, andillness anxiety disorder in first-degree relatives, im-plying Yutzy & Parish, 2008). Biochemical Decreased levels of serotonin and endorphins may playa role in the etiology of somatic symptom disorder, pre-dominantly pain. Serotonin is probably the main neu-rotransmitter involved in inhibiting the firing of afferentpain fibers (Parcell, 2008). The deficiency of endor-phins seems to correlate with an increase of incomingsensory (pain) stimuli (Wootton, 2008). Neuroanatomical Brain dysfunction has been proposed by some re-searchers as a factor in factitious disorders (Sadock &Sadock, 2007). The hypothesis is that impairment ininformation processing contributes to the aberrantbehaviors associated with the disorder. However, nogenetic patterns have been identified, nor have spe-cific electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalitiesbeen noted in clients with factitious disorder. Psychodynamic Some psychodynamicists view illness anxiety disorderas an ego defense mechanism. Physical complaintsare the expression of low self-esteem and feelings ofworthlessness, because it is easier to feel something iswrong with the body than to feel something is wrongwith the self. Another psychodynamic view of illnessanxiety disorder (as well as somatic symptom disorder,predominantly pain) is related to a defense againstguilt. The individual views the self as \"bad,\" based onreal or imagined past misconduct, and views physicalsuffering as the deserved punishment required foratonement. This view has also been related to individ-uals with factitious disorders. The psychodynamic theory of conversion disorder proposes that emotions associated with a traumaticevent that the individual cannot express because ofmoral or ethical unacceptability are \"converted\" intophysical symptoms. The unacceptable emotions are re-pressed and converted to a somatic hysterical symptomthat is symbolic in some way of the original emotionaltrauma. Some reports suggest that individuals with factitious disorders were victims of child abuse or neglect. Fre-quent childhood hospitalizations provided a reprievefrom the traumatic home situation and a loving and car-ing environment that was absent in the child's family.This theory proposes that the individual with factitiousdisorder is attempting to recapture the only positivesupport he or she may have known by seeking out theenvironment in which it was received as a child. Regard-ing factitious disorder imposed on another, Sadock andSadock (2007) have stated, \"One apparent purpose ofthe behavior is for the caretaker to indirectly assumethe sick role; another is to be relieved of the caretakingrole by having the child hospitalized\" (p. 661). Family Dynamics Some families have difficulty expressing emotionsopenly and resolving conflicts verbally.

Thus, somatization in thechild brings some stability to the family, as harmonyreplaces discord and the child's welfare becomes thecommon concern. The child in turn receives positivereinforcement for the illness. This shift in focus fromfamily discord to concern for the child is sometimescalled tertiary gain (see following section). Learning Theory Somatic complaints are often reinforced when thesick role relieves the individual from the need to dealwith a stressful situation, whether it be within societyor within the family. The sick person learns that he orshe may avoid stressful obligations, may postpone un-welcome challenges, and is excused from trouble-some duties (primary gain); becomes the prominentfocus of attention because of the illness ( secondary gain); or relieves conflict within the family as concernis shifted to the ill person and away from the real issue(tertiary gain). These types of positive reinforcementsvirtually guarantee repetition of the response. Past experience with serious or life-threatening phys- ical illness, either personal or that of close family mem-bers, can predispose an individual to illness anxietydisorder. Once an individual has experienced a threatto biological integrity, he or she may develop a fear ofrecurrence. The fear of recurring illness generates anexaggerated response to minor physical changes, lead-ing to excessive anxiety and health concerns. Transactional Model of Stress/Adaptation The etiology of somatic symptom disorders is mostlikely influenced by multiple factors. In Figure 29-1, agraphic depiction of this theory of multiple causationis presented in the Transa ctional Model of Stress/ Adaptation. Background Assessment Data: Types of Dissociative Disorders Dissociative Amnesianature, that is too extensive to be explained by ordi- nary forgetfulness, and is not due to the direct effectsof substance use or a neurological or other medicalcondition (APA, 2013). The DSM-5 states that the most common types of dissociative amnesia are localized, se-lective, and generalized. Localized and selective amne-sia are related to a specific stressful event that hasoccurred. For example, the individual with localized am- nesia is unable to recall all incidents associated with a stressful event. It may be broader than just a singleevent, however, such as being unable to remembermonths or years of child abuse (APA, 2013). In selective amnesia, the individual can recall only certain incidentsassociated with a stressful event for a specific periodafter the event. In the generalized type, the individual has amnesia for his or her identity and total life history. The individual with amnesia usually appears alert and may give no indication to observers that anythingis wrong, although some clients may present with al-terations in consciousness, with conversion symptoms,or in trance states. Clients suffering from amnesia areoften brought to general hospital emergency depart-ments by police who have found them wandering con-fusedly around the streets. Onset of an amnestic episode usually follows severe psychosocial stress. Termination is typically abruptand followed by complete recovery. sudden, unexpected travel away from cus-tomary place of daily activities, or by bewilderedwandering, with the inability to recall some or all ofone's past. An individual in a fugue state may not beable to recall personal identity and sometimes as-sumes a new identity (Black & Andreasen, 2011). The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for dissociative amnesia are presented in Box 29-6. Dissociative Identity Disorder Dissociative identity disorder (DID) was formerlycalled multiple personality disorder. This disorder ischaracterized by the existence of two or more person-alities in a single individual. Only one of the person-alities is evident at any given moment, and one ofthem is dominant most of the time over the course ofthe disorder. Each personality is unique and com-posed of a complex set of memories, behavior pat-terns, and social relationships that surface during thedominant interval. Transition from one personality toanother may be sudden or gradual, and is sometimesquite dramatic. Black and Andreasen (2011) state,\"Switches have been observed with stressful situations,disputes among the alters, and psychological con-flicts\" (p. 230). A switch may occur with a sudden dis-ruption in the individual's train of thought. There588 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation CORE CONCEPT Amnesia Pathologic loss of memory; a phenomenon in which an area of experience becomes inaccessible to consciousrecall. The loss in memory may be organic, emotional,dissociative, or of mixed origin, and may be permanentor limited to a sharply circumscribed period of time.(Shahrokh & Hales, 2003) Dissociative amnesia is an inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful4092_Ch29_581-607 23/07/14 12:37 PM Page 588may be rapid eye blinking and changes in voice or facial expression. Before therapy, the original personality usually has no knowledge of the other personalities, butwhen there are two or more subpersonalities, they areusually aware of each other's existence. Most often,the various subpersonalities have different names, butthey may be unnamed and may be of a different gender, race, and age. The various personalities are almost always quite disparate and may even appear to be the exact opposite of the original personality. For example, a normally shy, socially with-drawn, faithful husband may become a gregariouswomanizer and heavy drinker with the emergence ofanother personality. Generally, there is amnesia for the events that took place when another personality was in the dominantposition, and clients report \"gaps\" in autobiographi-cal histories. Sometimes, however, one personalitydoes not experience such amnesia and retains com-plete awareness of the existence, qualities, and activi-ties of the other personalities.

They may \"wake up\" in unfamiliarsituations with no idea where they are, how they gotthere, or of the identities of the people around them.They may frequently be accused of lying when theydeny remembering or being responsible for events or actions that occurred while another personalitycontrolled the body. Dissociative identity disorder is not always incapaci- tating. Some individuals with DID maintain responsiblepositions, complete graduate degrees, and are success-ful spouses and parents before diagnosis and while intreatment. Before they are diagnosed with DID, manyindividuals are misdiagnosed with depression, border-line and antisocial personality disorders, schizophrenia,epilepsy, or bipolar disorder. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for DID are presented in Box 29-7. Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder Depersonalization-derealization disorder is character-ized by a temporary change in the quality of self-awareness, which often takes the form of feelings of unreality, changes in body image, feelings of detachmentfrom the environment, or a sense of observing oneselffrom outside the body. Depersonalization (a distur- bance in the perception of oneself) is differentiatedfrom derealization , which describes an alteration in the perception of the external environment. Both ofthese phenomena also occur in a variety of psychiatricillnesses such as schizophrenia, depression, anxietystates, and neurocognitive disorders. As previouslystated, the symptoms of depersonalization and dere-alization are very common. It is estimated that approx-imately half of all adults have experienced transientepisodes of the symptoms. Diagnosis of the disorder ismade only if the symptoms cause significant distressor impairment in functioning. The DSM-5 describes this disorder as the persistence or recurrence of episodes of depersonalization, dere-alization, or both (APA, 2013). There may be a me-chanical or dreamlike feeling or a belief that the body'sphysical characteristics have changed. If derealizationis present, objects in the environment are perceived asaltered in size or shape. Other people in the environ-ment may seem automated or mechanical. These distorted perceptions are experienced as disturbing, and are often accompanied by anxiety, depression, fear of going insane, obsessive thoughts,590 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation BOX 29-6 Diagnostic Criteria for Dissociative Amnesia A. An inability to recall important autobiographical informa- tion, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is in- consistent with ordinary forgetting. Note: Dissociativeamnesia most often consists of localized or selective am-nesia for a specific event or events; or generalized amnesia for identity and life history. B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or im- pairment in social, occupational, or other important areasof functioning. C. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., alcohol or other drug ofabuse, a medication) or a neurological or other medicalcondition (e.g., partial complex seizures, transient globalamnesia, sequelae of a closed head injury/traumaticbrain injury, other neurological condition). D. The disturbance is not better explained by dissociative identity disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, acutestress disorder, somatic symptom disorder, or major neurocognitive disorder.

American Psychiatric Association.BOX 29-7 Diagnostic Criteria for Dissociative Identity Disorder A. Disruption of identity characterized by two or more dis- tinct personality states, which may be described in somecultures as an experience of possession. The disruptionin identity involves marked discontinuity in sense of selfand sense of agency, accompanied by related alterationsin affect, behavior, consciousness, memory, perception,cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. These signsand symptoms may be observed by others or reportedby the individual. B. Recurrent gaps in the recall of everyday events, impor- tant personal information, and/or traumatic events thatare inconsistent with ordinary forgetting. C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or im- pairment in social, occupational, or other important areasof functioning. D. The disturbance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural or religious practice. Note: In children,the symptoms are not better explained by imaginaryplaymates or other fantasy play. E. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts or chaotic behaviorduring alcohol intoxication) or another medical condition(e.g., complex partial seizures).

The disorder occurs more often inwomen than it does in men and is a disorder ofyounger people, rarely occurring in individuals olderthan 40 years of age (Black & Andreasen, 2011). The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for depersonalization- derealization disorder are presented in Box 29-8. Predisposing Factors Associated With Dissociative Disorders Genetics Regarding DID, Maldonado and Spiegel (2008) re- port on twin studies with monozygotic and dizygoticpairs in which the results suggested \"common geneticfactors underlying pathological and nonpathologicaldissociative capacity\" (p. 685). Further research is required to determine if there is a true genetic influ-ence associated with the etiology of DID. Neurobiological Some clinicians have suggested a possible correlationbetween neurological alterations and dissociative dis-orders. Although available information is inadequate,it is possible that dissociative amnesia may be relatedto neurophysiological dysfunction. Areas of the brainthat have been associated with memory include Given the intimate relationship between dissociation, memory, and trauma, researchers have begun to inves-tigate the brain structures and neurochemical systemsthat mediate functions. Several sub stances such as sodium-lactate, yohimbine, and metachlorophenylpiper - azine have been shown to elicit dissociative symptoms inpatients with PTSD or panic disorder, but not in normalcontrols. Such findings suggest a role for the locuscoeruleus/noradrenergic system, which is implicated infear and arousal regulation and influence a number ofcortical structures such as prefrontal, sensory andparietal cortex, the hippocampus, the hypothalamus, theamygdala, and the spinal Still the relationship be-tween trauma exposure, cortisol, hippocampus damage,memory, and dissociation is tentative at best, and remains to be thoroughly investigated. (p. 26) Some studies have suggested a possible link between DID and certain neurological conditions, such as tem- poral lobe epilepsy and severe migraine headaches.Electroencephalographic abnormalities have been observed in some clients with DID. Psychodynamic Theory Freud (1962) believed that dissociative behaviors oc-curred when individuals repressed distressing mentalcontents from conscious awareness. He believed thatthe unconscious was a dynamic entity in which re-pressed mental contents were stored and unavailableto conscious recall. Current psychodynamic explana-tions of dissociation are based on Freud's concepts.The repression of mental contents is perceived as acoping mechanism for protecting the client fromemotional pain that has arisen from either disturbingexternal circumstances or anxiety-provoking internalurges and feelings (Maldonado & Spiegel, 2008). Inthe case of depersonalization and derealization, thepain and anxiety are expressed as feelings of unrealityor detachment from the environment of the painfulsituation. Psychological Trauma A growing body of evidence points to the etiology ofDID as a set of traumatic experiences that overwhelmsthe individual's capacity to cope by any means otherthan dissociation. These experiences usually take theform of severe physical, sexual, or psychological abuseCHAPTER 29 Somatic Symptom and Dissociative Disorders 591 BOX 29-8 Diagnostic Criteria for Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder A. The presence of persistent or recurrent depersonalization, derealization, or both: 1. Depersonalization: Experiences of unreality, detach- ment, or being an outside observer with respect to one's thoughts, feelings, sensations, body, or actions (e.g., per-ceptual alterations, distorted sense of time, unreal or absent self, emotional and/or physical numbing). 2. Derealization: Experiences of unreality or detachment with respect to surroundings (e.g., individuals or objectsare experienced as unreal, dreamlike, foggy, lifeless, orvisually distorted). B. During the depersonalization or derealization experiences, reality testing remains intact.C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or im- pairment in social, occupational, or other important areasof functioning. D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological ef- fects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, medication)or another medical condition (e.g., seizures). E. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as schizophrenia, panic disorder, major de-pressive disorder, acute stress disorder, posttraumaticstress disorder, or another dissociative disorder.

The most widely accepted explanation for DID is that it be-gins as a survival strategy that serves to help childrencope with the horrifying sexual, physical, or psycholog-ical abuse. In this traumatic environment, the childuses dissociation to become a passive victim of the crueland unwanted experience. He or she creates a newbeing who is able to endure the overwhelming pain ofthe cruel reality, while the primary self can then escapeawareness of the pain. Each new personality has as itsnucleus a means of responding without anxiety anddistress to various painful or dangerous stimuli. Transactional Model of Stress/Adaptation The etiology of dissociative disorders is most likely influ-enced by multiple factors. In Figure 29-2, a graphic de-piction of this theory of multiple causation is presentedin the Transactional Model of Stress/Adaptation. Diagnosis/Outcome Identification Nursing diagnoses are formulated from the data gath-ered during the assessment phase and with backgroundknowledge regarding predisposing factors to the disor-der. Table 29-1 presents a list of client behaviors and theNANDA nursing diagnoses that correspond to those be-haviors, which may be used in planning care for clientswith somatic symptom and dissociative disorders. Outcome Criteria The following criteria may be used for measurementof outcomes in the care of the client with somaticsymptom and dissociative disorders. The client: Effectively uses adaptive coping strategies duringstressful situations without resorting to physicalsymptoms (somatic symptom disorder ) Verbalizes relief from pain and demonstratesadaptive coping strategies during stressful situa-tions to prevent the onset of pain (somatic symp-tom disorder) Interprets bodily sensations rationally; verbalizesunderstanding of the significance the irrationalfear held for him or her; and has decreased the592 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE Brunner, R., Parzer, P., Schuld, V., & Resch, F. (2000, February). Dissociative symptomatology and traumato-genic factors in adolescent psychiatric patients. The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 188 (2), 71-77. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: This study describes the rela- tionship between different types of childhood trauma to thedegr ee of dissociative experiences. Subjects were 198 con- secutively admitted adolescent psychiatric patients, 11 to19 years old (89 inpatients and 109 outpatients). All patientscompleted the Adolescent Dissociative Experiences Scale(ADES), a self-administered questionnaire with 30 items thatquantifies the frequency of dissociative experiences on an11-point scale ranging from 0 (never) to 10 (always). Theinstrument has been shown to discriminate patients with dis-sociative disorders from patients in several other diagnos-tic categories, as well as from adolescents in the generalpopulation. Subjects' therapists were asked to completethe Checklist of Traumatic Childhood Events, based on as-sessments, client self-reports, and reports by caregiversand custodial and social services. The checklist coveredfour main areas of traumatic experiences: sexual abuse,physical abuse, neglect, and stressful life events. Eacharea was further categorized by experiences consideredfrom minor to severe. Examples of these abuse extremesincluded: \u0081Sexual: From sexualized communication to fondling to masturbation to penetration \u0081Physical: From being hit with a hand to punching, kicking, lacerations, burns, fractures\u0081Neglect: From physical and educational neglect to social/environmental neglect to emotional and psychologicalinvolvement (rejection; hostility) \u0081Stressful life events: From loss related to family membersto physical/mental illness of family members to \"others\"(e.g., personal physical illness, witnessing an accident orviolence, institutional placement) RESULTS OF THE STUDY: All mean scores by traumatized ado- lescents were elevated in comparison to those of the control (nontraumatized) g roup. Increased dissociative symptoma- tolog y was unrelated to the degree of severity of sexual abuse experiences. Interestingly, the study found an increasedamount of dissociative symptomatology associated withminor forms of physical abuse, as compared to the severeforms. Only severe forms of stressful life events contributedsignificantly to a higher degree of dissociative experiences.The study revealed that emotional neglect appears to be thebest predictor of dissociative symptoms. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The authors state: \"In contrast to the current psychopathogenic model of dis- sociation which maintains that par ticularly severe traumatic events lead to dissociative symptomatolog y, moderate but chronic emotional stress may be equal or even more im-portant in the development of dissociation.\" This is impor-tant information for the nursing database. Nurses should beaware that even less severe forms of abuse and neglectmay have a significant impact on the development of dissociative psychopathology in adolescents.4092_Ch29_581-607 23/07/14 12:37 PM Page 592number and of physical complaints ( ill- ness anxiety disorder ) Is free of physical disability and is able to verbalize understanding of the possible correlation betweenthe loss of or alteration in function and extremeemotional stress (conversion disorder) Can recall events associated with a traumatic orstressful situation ( dissociative amnesia ) Has recovered lost memories for events of past life(dissociative amnesia ) Can verbalize the extreme anxiety that precipi-tated dissociation ( depersonalization-derealization disorder)Can demonstrate more adaptive coping in the face of severeanxiety ( depersonalization-derealization disorder) Verbalizes understanding of the existence of multiple personalities and the purposes they serve(dissociative identity disorder ) Is able to maintain a sense of reality during stressfulsituations (depersonalization-derealization disorder) Planning/Implementation The following section presents a group of selectednursing diagnoses, with short- and long-term goalsand nursing interventions for each.CHAPTER 29 Somatic Symptom and Dissociative Disorders 593 Cognitive Appraisal * Primary * (Real or perceived threat to biological integrity or self-concept) * Secondary * Because of weak ego strength, patient is unable to use coping mechanisms effectively.

Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal Within (specified time), client will verbalize under-standing of correlation between physical symptomsand psychological problems. Long-Term Goal By time of discharge from treatment, client willdemonstrate ability to cope with stress by meansother than preoccupation with physical symptoms.Interventions Monitor the physician's ongoing assessments, lab-oratory reports, and other data to maintain assur-ance that the possibility of organic pathology isclearly ruled out. Review findings with the client.Accurate medical assessment is vital for the provi-sion of adequate and appropriate care. Honest explanation may help the client understand thepsychological implications. Recognize and accept that the physical complaintis real to the client, even though no organic etiol-ogy can be identified. Denial of the client's feelingsis nontherapeutic and interferes with establish-ment of a trusting relationship. Provide pain medication as prescribed by physician.Client comfort and safety are nursing priorities. Identify gains that the physical symptoms are providing for the client: increased dependency, 594 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation TABLE 29-1 Assigning Nursing Diagnoses to Behaviors Commonly Associated with Somatic Symptom and Dissociative Disorders BEHAVIORS NURSING DIAGNOSES Verbalization of numerous physical complaints in the absence of any pathophysiological evidence; focus on the self and physical symptoms ( somatic symptom disorder ) History of \"doctor shopping\" for evidence of organic pathology to substantiate physical symptoms; statements such as, \"I don't know why the doctor put me on the psychiatric unit. I have a physical problem.\" ( somatic symptom disorder) Preoccupation with and unrealistic interpretation of bodily signs and sensations ( illness anxiety disorder) Loss or alteration in physical functioning without evidence of organic pathology ( conversion disorder ) Need for assistance to carry out self-care activities such as eating, dressing, maintaining hygiene, and toileting due to alteration in physical functioning ( conversion disorder ) History of numerous exacerbations of physical illness; inappropriate or exaggerated behaviors; denial of emotional problems (psychological factors affecting other medical conditions) Loss of memory ( dissociative amnesia ) Verbalizations of frustration over lack others ( dissociative amnesia ) Unresolved grief; depression; self-blame associated with childhood abuse ( DID) Presence of more than one personality within the individual ( DID) Alteration in the perception or experience of the self or the environment ( depersonalization-derealization disorder ) Feigning of physical or psychological symptoms to gain attention (factitious disorder)Ineffective coping; chronic pain Deficient knowledge (psychological causes for physical symptoms) Fear (of having a serious disease) Disturbed sensory perception*Self-care deficit Deficient knowledge (psychological factors affecting medical condition); Ineffective denial Impaired memory Powerlessness Risk for suicideDisturbed personality identity Disturbed sensory perception (visual/ kinesthetic)* Ineffective coping *This diagnosis has been retired from the NANDA-I list of approved diagnoses.

Identification of underlying motivation is impor-tant in assisting the client with problem resolution. Initially, fulfill the client's most urgent dependencyneeds, but gradually withdraw attention to physicalsymptoms. Minimize time given in response to phys-ical complaints. Anxiety and maladaptive behaviorswill increase if dependency needs are ignored ini-tially. Gradual withdrawal of positive reinforcementwill discourage repetition of maladaptive behaviors. Explain to the client that any new physical com-plaints will be referred to the physician and give nofurther attention to them. Follow up on the physi-cian's assessment of the complaint. The possibilityof organic pathology must always be considered.Failure to do so could jeopardize client safety. Encourage the client to verbalize fears and anxieties.Explain that attention will be withdrawn if ruminationabout physical complaints begins. Follow through.Without consistency of limit setting, change will notoccur. Help the client recognize that physical symptomsoften occur because of, or are exacerbated by, spe-cific stressors. Discuss alternative coping strategiesthat client may use in response to stress (e.g., relax-ation exercises, physical activities, assertiveness skills).The client may need help with problem-solving. Givepositive reinforcement for adaptive coping strategies. Have the client keep a diary of appearance, dura-tion, and intensity of physical symptoms. A separaterecord of situations that the client finds especiallystressful should also be kept. Comparison of theserecords may provide objective data from which toobserve the relationship between physical symp-toms and stress. Help the client identify ways to achieve recognitionfrom others without resorting to physical symp-toms. Positive recognition from others enhancesself-esteem and minimizes the need for attentionthrough maladaptive behaviors. Discuss how interpersonal relationships are af-fected by the client's narcissistic behavior. Explainhow this behavior alienates others. The client maynot realize how he or she is perceived by others. Provide instruction in relaxation techniques andassertiveness skills. These approaches decrease anx-iety and increase self-esteem, which facilitate adap-tive responses to stressful situations. Fear (of Having a Serious Disease) Fearis defined as the \"response to perceived threat that is consciously recognized as a danger\" (NANDA-I,2012, p. 361). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined.Short-Term Goal Client will verbalize that fears associated with bodilysensations are irrational (within time limit deemedappropriate for specific individual). Long-Term Goal Client interprets bodily sensations correctly. Interventions Monitor the physician's ongoing assessments and laboratory reports. Organic pathology must be clearlyruled out. Refer all new physical complaints to the physician.To ignore all physical complaints could place theclient's safety in jeopardy. Assess what function the client's illness is fulfillingfor him or her (e.g., unfulfilled needs for depend-ency, nurturing, caring, attention, or control). Thisinformation may provide insight into reasons formaladaptive behavior and provide direction forplanning client care. Identify times during which the preoccupationwith physical symptoms is worse. Determine the extent of correlation of physical complaints withtimes of increased anxiety. The client may be un-aware of the psychosocial implications of the phys-ical complaints. Knowledge of the relationship isthe first step in the process for creating change. Convey empathy. Let the client know that you under-stand how a specific symptom may conjure up fearsof previous life-threatening illness. Unconditional acceptance and empathy promote a therapeuticnurse-client relationship. Initially allow the client a limited amount of time(e.g., 10 minutes each hour) to discuss physical symp-toms. Because this has been his or her primarymethod of coping for so long, complete prohibitionof this activity would likely raise the client's anxietylevel significantly, further exacerbating the behavior. Help the client determine what techniques may bemost useful for him or her to implement when fearand anxiety are exacerbated (e.g., relaxation tech-niques, mental imagery, thought-stopping tech-niques, physical exercise). All of these techniquesare effective in reducing anxiety and may assist theclient in the transition from focusing on fear ofphysical illness to the discussion of honest feelings. Gradually increase the limit on amount of timespent each hour in discussing physical symptoms.If the client violates the limits, withdraw attention.Lack of positive reinforcement may help to extin-guish the maladaptive behavior. Encourage the client to discuss feelings associatedwith fear of serious illness. Verbalization of feelingsin a nonthreatening environment facilitates ex-pression and resolution of disturbing emotional is-sues. When the client can express feelings directly,CHAPTER 29 Somatic Symptom and Dissociative Disorders 5954092_Ch29_581-607 23/07/14 12:37 PM Page 595there is less need to express them through physical symptoms. Role-play the client's plan for dealing with the fearthe next time it assumes control and before anxietybecomes disabling. Anxiety and fears are mini-mized when the client has achieved a degree ofcomfort through practicing a plan for dealing withstressful situations in the future. Disturbed Sensory Perception Disturbed sensory perception is defined as a \"change in the amount or patterning of incoming stimuli accom-panied by a diminished, exaggerated, distorted, orimpaired response to such stimuli\" (NANDA-I, 2012,p. 490). Table 29-2 presents this nursing diagnosis incare plan format.Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal The client will verbalize understanding of emotionalproblems as a contributing factor to the alterationin physical functioning (within time limit appropri-ate for specific individual). Long-Term Goal The client will demonstrate recovery of lost or altered function. Interventions Monitor the physician's ongoing assessments, lab-oratory reports, and other data to ensure that the596 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation Table 29-2 | CARE PLAN FOR THE CLIENT WITH CONVERSION DISORDER NURSING DIAGNOSIS: DISTURBED SENSORY PERCEPTION RELATED TO: Repressed severe anxiety EVIDENCED BY: Loss or alteration in physical functioning, without evidence of organic pathology OUTCOME CRITERIA NURSING INTERVENTIONS RATIONALE Short-Term Goal \u0081 Client will verbalize understanding of emotional problems as a contributing factor to the alteration in physical functioning (within time limit appropriate for specific individual).

Failure to do so may jeopardize the client's safety. Identify primary or secondary gains that the physicalsymptom is providing for the client (e.g., increaseddependency, attention, protection from experienc-ing a stressful event). These are considered to be eti-ological factors and may be used to assist in problemresolution. Do not focus on the disability, and encourage theclient to be as independent as possible. Interveneonly when the client requires assistance. Positive reinforcement would encourage continued use ofthe maladaptive response for secondary gains, suchas dependency. Maintain a nonjudgmental attitude when providingassistance with self-care activities to the client. Thephysical symptom is not within the client's con-scious control and is very real to him or her. Do not allow the client to use the disability as a manipulative tool to avoid participating in thera-peutic activities. Withdraw attention if the clientcontinues to focus on the physical limitation. Lackof reinforcement may help to extinguish the mal-adaptive response. Encourage the client to verbalize fears and anxieties.Help identify physical symptoms as a coping mech-anism that is used in times of extreme stress. Clientswith conversion disorder are usually unaware of thepsychological implications of their illness. Help the client identify coping mechanisms that heor she could use when faced with stressful situa-tions, rather than retreating from reality with aphysical disability. The client needs assistance withproblem solving at this severe level of anxiety.Give positive reinforcement for identification or demonstration of alternative, more adaptivecoping strategies. Deficient Knowledge (Psychological Factors Affecting Medical Condition) Deficient knowledge is defined as \"absence or deficiency of cognitive information related to a specific topic\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 271). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal Client will cooperate with plan for teaching pro-vided by primary nurse. Long-Term Goal By time of discharge from treatment, client will beable to verbalize psychological factors affecting hisor her physical condition. Interventions Assess client's level of knowledge regarding effectsof psychological problems on the body. An ade-quate database is necessary for the development ofan effective teaching plan. Assess client's level of anxiety and readiness tolearn. Learning does not occur beyond the moder-ate level of anxiety. Discuss physical examinations and laboratory teststhat have been conducted. Explain purpose and re-sults of each. Fear of the unknown may contribute toelevated level of anxiety. Client has the right to knowabout and accept or refuse any medical treatment.CHAPTER 29 Somatic Symptom and Dissociative Disorders 597 Table 29-2 | CARE PLAN FOR THE CLIENT WITH CONVERSION DISORDER\u2014cont'd OUTCOME CRITERIA NURSING INTERVENTIONS RATIONALE 6.Encourage the client to verbalize fears and anxieties.

Go slowly. These feelings may have been suppressed or repressed forso long that their disclosure may be a very painfulexperience. Be supportive. Expression of feelingsin the presence of a trusted individual and in anonthreatening environment may encourage theindividual to confront unresolved issues. Have client keep a diary of appearance, duration,and intensity of physical symptoms. A separaterecord of situations that the client finds especiallystressful should also be kept. Comparison of theserecords may provide objective data from which toobserve the relationship between physical symp-toms and stress. Help client identify needs that are being metthrough the sick role. Together, formulate moreadaptive means for fulfilling these needs. Practiceby role-playing. Repetition through practice servesto reduce discomfort in the actual situation. Provide instruction in assertiveness techniques, especially the ability to recognize the differencesamong passive, assertive, and aggressive behaviorsand the importance of respecting the rights of oth-ers while protecting one's own basic rights. Theseskills will preserve the client's self-esteem while alsoimproving his or her ability to form satisfactory interpersonal relationships. Discuss adaptive methods of stress management,such as relaxation techniques, physical exercise,meditation, breathing exercises, and autogenics.Use of these adaptive techniques may decrease appearance of physical symptoms in response tostress. Impaired Memory Impaired memory is defined as an \"inability to remem- ber or recall bits of information or behavioral skills\"(NANDA-I, 2012, p. 273). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal The client will verbalize understanding that the lossof memory is related to a stressful situation andbegin discussing the stressful situation with nurseor therapist. Long-Term Goal The client will recover deficits in memory and develop more adaptive coping mechanisms to dealwith stressful situations. Interventions Obtain as much information as possible about theclient from family and significant others if possible.Consider likes, dislikes, important people, activi-ties, music, and pets. A comprehensive baseline assessment is necessary for the development of aneffective plan of care. Do not flood the client with data regarding his or her past life. Individuals who are exposed topainful information from which the amnesia is pro-viding protection may decompensate even furtherinto a psychotic state. Instead, expose the client to stimuli that representpleasant experiences from the past, such as smellsassociated with enjoyable activities, beloved pets,and music known to have been pleasurable to theclient. As memory begins to return, engage theclient in activities that may provide additional stim-ulation. Recall often occurs during activities suchas these that simulate life experiences. Encourage the client to discuss situations that havebeen especially stressful and to explore the feelingsassociated with those times. Verbalization of feel-ings in a nonthreatening environment may helpthe client come to terms with unresolved issues thatmay be contributing to the dissociative process. Identify specific conflicts that remain unresolvedand help the client identify possible solutions. Pro-vide instruction regarding more adaptive ways torespond to anxiety. Unless these underlying con-flicts are resolved, any improvement in coping behaviors must be viewed as only temporary. Provide positive feedback for decisions made. Respect the client's right to make those decisionsindependently, and refrain from attempting to in-fluence him or her toward those that may seemmore logical. Independent choice provides a feel-ing of control, decreases feelings of powerlessness,and increases self-esteem. Disturbed Personal Identity Disturbed personal identity is defined as the \"inability tomaintain an integrated and complete perception ofself\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 282). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goals The client will verbalize understanding about theexistence of multiple personalities within the self. The client will be able to recognize stressful situa-tions that precipitate transition from one person-ality to another. Long-Term Goals The client will verbalize understanding of the reasonfor existence of each personality and the role eachplays for the individual.598 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch29_581-607 23/07/14 12:37 PM Page 598The client will enter into and cooperate with long- term therapy, with the ultimate goal being integra-tion into one personality. Interventions The nurse must develop a trusting relationship withthe original personality and with each of the sub-personalities. Trust is the basis of a therapeutic re-lationship. Each of the personalities views itself as aseparate entity and initially must be treated as such. Help the client understand the existence of the sub-personalities and the need each serves in the personalidentity of the individual. The client may initially beunaware of the dissociative response. Knowledge ofthe needs each personality fulfills is the first step inthe integration process and the client's ability to faceunresolved issues without dissociation. Help the client identify stressful situations that precipitate transition from one personality to an-other. Carefully observe and record these transitions.Identification of stressors is required to assist theclient in responding more adaptively and to elimi-nate the need for transition to another personality. Use nursing interventions necessary to deal withmaladaptive behaviors associated with individualsubpersonalities. For example, if one personality issuicidal, precautions must be taken to guard againstthe client's self-harm. If another personality has atendency toward physical hostility, precautions mustbe taken to protect others. CLINICAL PEARL It may be possible to seek assistance from one of the personalities. For example, a strong-willed personality may help to control the behaviors of a \"suicidal\" personality. Help subpersonalities understand that their \"being\" will not be destroyed, but rather integratedinto a unified identity within the individual. Be-cause the subpersonalities function as separate entities, the idea of total elimination generates fearand defensiveness. Provide support during disclosure of painful expe-riences and reassurance when the client becomesdiscouraged with lengthy treatment. Disturbed Sensory Perception (Visual/Kinesthetic) Disturbed sensory perception is defined as a \"change in the amount or patterning of incoming stimuli accompaniedby a diminished, exaggerated, distorted, or impaired response to such stimuli\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 490). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal Client will verbalize adaptive ways of coping with stress.Long-Term Goal Client will demonstrate the ability to perceive stim-uli correctly and maintain a sense of reality duringstressful situations. Interventions Provide support and encouragement during timesof depersonalization. Clients manifesting thesesymptoms may express fear and anxiety. They do notunderstand the response and may express a fear ofgoing insane. Support and encouragement from atrusted individual provide a feeling of security whenfears and anxieties are manifested. Explain the depersonalization behaviors and the purpose they usually serve for the client. Thisknowledge may help to minimize fears and anxi-eties associated with their occurrence. Explain the relationship between severe anxiety anddepersonalization behaviors. Help relate these behav-iors to times of severe psychological stress that clienthas experienced. The client may be unaware that theoccurrence of depersonalization behaviors is relatedto severe anxiety. Knowledge of this relationship is thefirst step in the process of behavioral change. Explore past experiences and possibly repressedpainful situations such as trauma or abuse. Trau-matic experiences may predispose individuals todissociative disorders. Discuss these painful experiences with client, andencourage him or her to deal with the feelings as-sociated with these situations. Work to resolve theconflicts these repressed feelings have nurtured.Conflict resolution will serve to decrease the needfor the dissociative response to anxiety. Discuss ways the client may more adaptively respondto stress, and use role-play to practice using these newmethods. Having practiced through role-play helpsto prepare client to face stressful situations by usingthese new behaviors when they occur in real life. Concept Care Mapping The concept map care plan is an innovative approach toplanning and organizing nursing care (see Chapter 9).It is a diagrammatic teaching and learning strategy thatallows visualization of interrelationships between medicaldiagnoses, nursing diagnoses, assessment data, and treat-ments. Examples of concept map care plans for clientswith somatic symptom and dissociative disorders are presented in Figures 29-3 and 29-4. Evaluation Reassessment is conducted to determine if the nursingactions have been successful in achieving the objectivesof care. Evaluation of the nursing actions for the clientwith a somatic symptom disorder may be facilitated byCHAPTER 29 Somatic Symptom and Dissociative Disorders 5994092_Ch29_581-607 23/07/14 12:37 PM Page 599gathering information using the following types of questions: Can the client recognize signs and symptoms of escalating anxiety? Can the client intervene with adaptive copingstrategies to interrupt the escalating anxiety beforephysical symptoms are exacerbated?Can the client verbalize an understanding of thecorrelation between physical symptoms and timesof escalating anxiety? Does the client have a plan for dealing with increasedstress to prevent exacerbation of physical symptoms? Does the client demonstrate a decrease in rumina-tions about physical symptoms?600 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation Clinical Vignette: Veronica, age 51, has a long history of \"doctor shopping\" for numerous complaints of gastrointestinal distress, daily headaches, and abdominal pain. She has undergone numerous tests that show no evidence ofpathophysiology. Her husband of 25 years recently died of a myocardial infarction (MI). Y esterday, she began havingchest pains and was certain she was having a heart attack. Her daughter called 911, and Veronica was transported tothe emergency department. The staff performed diagnostic studies and laboratory tests, which were all negative forpathophysiology. She was admitted to the psychiatric unit with a diagnosis of Somatic Symptom Disorder. The nursedevelops the following concept map care plan for Veronica. Ineffective coping Fear (of dying as husband did from acute MI) Physical complaints Absence of pathophysiology Focus on self and physical symptoms Chest pains and fear of having a heart attack (following husband's sudden death from MI) Ongoing assessment Accept that the symptoms are real to the client Identify personal gains Fulfill client's needs Do not give positive reinforcement to symptoms Limit amount of time client discusses symptoms Teach adaptive coping strategies Ongoing assessment Refer all new physical complaints to physician Discuss client fears and anxieties Encourage verbalization of feelings associated with husband's death Encourage participation in grief support group Medical Rx:Duloxetine 60 mg q day forchronic pain/depression/anxiety Client recognizes signs and symptoms of escalating anxiety Client is able to intervene before the exacerbation of physical symptoms Client discusses feelings associated with husband's death Fears of own serious illness have diminished Client uses adaptive coping mechanisms to diminish fears/anxietiesSigns and SymptomsSigns and Symptoms Nursing DiagnosisNursing Diagnosis Nursing Actions Nursing Actions Outcomes: Outcomes: FIGURE 29-3 Concept map care plan for a client with somatic symptom disorder.4092_Ch29_581-607 23/07/14 12:37 PM Page 600Have fears of serious illness diminished? Does the client demonstrate full recovery from pre- vious loss or alteration of physical functioning? Evaluation of the nursing actions for the client with a dissociative disorder may be facilitated by gatheringinformation using the following types of questions: Has the client's memory been restored? Can the client connect occurrence of psychologicalstress to loss of memory?Does the client discuss fears and anxieties withmembers of the staff in an effort toward resolution? Can the client discuss the presence of various per-sonalities within the self? Can he or she verbalize why these personalities exist? Can the client verbalize situations that precipitatetransition from one personality to another? Can the client maintain a sense of reality duringstressful situations?CHAPTER 29 Somatic Symptom and Dissociative Disorders 601 Clinical Vignette: Wanda, age 32, was diagnosed 5 years ago with Dissociative Identity Disorder. History revealed severe childhood physical and sexual abuse by both parents. Several personalities have surfaced during years oftherapy: an aggressive personality (Jamie), a suicidal personality (Ida), and 4-year-old child (Anna). Y esterday, followinga particularly intense session with her therapist, the personality \"Ida\" surfaced and swallowed an undisclosed number ofsertraline tablets. Wanda's group-home leader called 911, and Wanda was transported to the emergency department(ED). Following stabilization in the ED, Wanda was admitted to the psychiatric unit. The nurse develops the followingconcept map care plan for Wanda.

Can the client demonstrate more adaptive copingstrategies for dealing with stress without resortingto dissociation? Treatment Modalities Somatic Symptom Disorders Individual Psychotherapy The goal of psychotherapy is to help clients develophealthy and adaptive behaviors, encourage them tomove beyond their somatization, and manage theirlives more effectively. The focus is on personal and so-cial difficulties that the client is experiencing in dailylife as well as the achievement of practical solutionsfor these difficulties. Treatment is initiated with a complete physical examination to rule out organic pathology. Once thishas been ensured, the physician turns his or her at-tention to the client's social and personal problemsand away from the somatic complaints. Group Psychotherapy Group therapy may be helpful for somatic symptomdisorders because it provides a setting where clientscan share their experiences of illness, can learn to ver-balize thoughts and feelings, and can be confrontedby group members and leaders when they reject responsibility for maladaptive behaviors. It has beenreported to be the treatment of choice for both so-matic symptom disorder and illness anxiety disorder,in part because it provides the social support and social interaction that these clients need. Behavior Therapy Behavior therapy is more likely to be successful in in-stances when secondary gain is prominent. This mayinvolve working with the client's family or significantothers who may be perpetuating the physical symp-toms by rewarding passivity and dependency and bybeing overly solicitous and helpful. Behavioral therapyfocuses on teaching these individuals to reward theclient's autonomy, self-sufficiency, and independence.This process becomes more difficult when the clientis very regressed and the sick role well established. Psychopharmacology Antidepressants are often used with somatic symptomdisorder when the predominant symptom is pain.They have been shown to be effective in relieving pain,independent of influences on mood. The tricyclic an-tidepressants (TCAs) have been used extensively, andtheir efficacy in relieving pain has been demonstrated.Adverse effects with TCAs, however, make their use problematic with some individuals. Leo (2008) reported that \"the serotonin and norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) venlafaxine and duloxetinehave demonstrated utility as analgesic agents and by-pass several of the untoward effects commonly associ-ated with the TCAs\" (p. 1038). Selective serotoninreuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have not exhibited theconsistent analgesic efficacy demonstrated by theTCAs and SNRIs effective in treating neuropathicand neuralgic pain, at least for short periods. Their efficacy in other somatic symptom (pain) disorders isless clear. Dissociative Amnesia Many cases of dissociative amnesia resolve sponta-neously when the individual is removed from the stress-ful situation. For other, more refractory conditions,intravenous administration of amobarbital is useful inthe retrieval of lost memories. Most clinicians recom-mend supportive psychotherapy as well to reinforce adjustment to the psychological impact of the retrievedmemories and the emotions associated with them. In some instances, psychotherapy is used as the pri- mary treatment. Techniques of persuasion and free ordirected association are used to help the client remem-ber. In other cases, hypnosis may be required to mobi-lize the memories. Hypnosis is sometimes facilitated bythe use of pharmacological agents, such as sodiumamobarbital. Once the memories have been obtainedthrough hypnosis, supportive psychotherapy or grouppsychotherapy may be employed to help the client in-tegrate the memories into his or her conscious state. Dissociative Identity Disorder The goal of therapy for the client with DID is to opti-mize the client's function and potential. The achieve-ment of integration (a blending of all the personalities into one) is usually considered desirable, but someclients choose not to pursue this lengthy therapeuticregimen. In these cases resolution, or a smooth col-laboration among the subpersonalities, may be all thatis realistic. Intensive, long-term psychotherapy with the DID client is directed toward uncovering the underlyingpsychological conflicts, helping him or her gain in-sight into these conflicts, and striving to synthesize thevarious identities into one integrated personality.Clients are assisted to recall past traumas in detail.They must mentally reexperience the abuse thatcaused their illness. This process, called abreaction, or \"remembering with feeling,\" is so painful that clients602 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch29_581-607 23/07/14 12:37 PM Page 602may actually cry, scream, and feel the pain that they felt at the time of the abuse. During therapy, each personality is actively explored and encouraged to become aware of the others acrosspreviously amnestic barriers. Traumatic memories asso-ciated with the different personality manifestations, es-pecially those related to childhood abuse, are examined.The course of treatment is often difficult and anxietyprovoking to client and therapist alike, especially whenaggressive or suicidal personalities are in the dominantrole. In these instances, brief periods of hospitalizationmay be necessary as an interim supportive measure. When integration is achieved, the individual be- comes a total of all the feelings, experiences, memo-ries, skills, and talents that were previously in thecommand of the various personalities. He or she learnshow to function effectively without the necessity forcreating new personalities to cope with life. This is pos-sible only after years of intense psychotherapy, andeven then, recovery is often incomplete.Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder Information about the treatment of depersonaliza-tion-derealization disorder is sparse and inconclusive.Various psychiatric medications have been tried, bothsingly and in combination: antidepressants, mood sta-bilizers, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics. Resultshave been sporadic at best. If other psychiatric disor-ders, such as schizophrenia, are evident, they too maybe treated pharmacologically. A study by Simeon,Stein, and Hollander (1998) found the antidepres-sant clomipramine (Anafranil) to be a promisingpharmacological treatment for primary depersonal-ization-derealization disorder. For clients with evidentintrapsychic conflict, analytically oriented insight psy-chotherapy may be useful. Some clients with deper-sonalization-derealization disorder have benefitedfrom hypnotherapy or cognitive-behavioral therapy(CBT). With CBT, these clients \"learn to confronttheir distorted thoughts and challenge their feelingsof unreality\" (Black & Andreasen, 2011, p. 234).CHAPTER 29 Somatic Symptom and Dissociative Disorders 603 CASE STUDY AND SAMPLE CARE PLAN NURSING HISTORY AND ASSESSMENT Jake is a 54-year-old client of the psychiatric outpatient de- partment of the VA Medical Center. At age 42, Jake wasdiagnosed with colon cancer and underwent a colon re-section. Since that time, he has had regular follow-upexams, with no recurrence of the cancer and no residualeffects. He did not require follow-up chemotherapy or ra-diation therapy. For 10 years, Jake has had yearly physicaland laboratory examinations. He regularly complains to hisfamily physician of mild abdominal pain, sensations of\"fullness,\" \"bowel rumblings,\" and what he calls a \"firmmass,\" which he says he can sometimes feel in his lowerleft quadrant. The physician has performed x-rays of theentire gastrointestinal (GI) tract, an esophagoscopy, gas-troscopy, and colonoscopy. All results were negative for or-ganic pathology. Rather than being relieved, Jake appearsto be resentful and disappointed that the physician hasnot been able to reveal a pathological problem. Jake's jobis in jeopardy because of excessive use of sick leave. Thefamily physician has referred Jake for psychiatric evalua-tion. Jake was admitted as an outpatient with the diagnosisof illness anxiety disorder. He has been assigned to Lisa, apsychiatric nurse practitioner. In her assessment, Lisa learns that Jake has pretty much lived his adult life in isolation. He was never closeto his parents, who worked and seldom had time for Jakeor his sister. Jake told Lisa that, \"My parents really didn'tcare about me. They were too busy taking care of the farm.Dad wanted me to take over the farm, but I was never in-terested. I liked working on cars, and went to vocationalschool to learn how to be a mechanic. I thought they wouldbe proud of me, but they never cared. I think they only hadkids so they would have some help on the farm. When I lefthome, they really didn't care if they ever saw me again.\" Hehas never been married nor had a really serious relationship.\"Women don't like me much. I spend most of my timealone. I guess I don't really like people, and they don't reallylike me.\" NURSING DIAGNOSES/OUTCOME IDENTIFICATION From the assessment data, the nurse develops the following nursing diagnoses for Jake: 1.Fear (of cancer recurrence) related to history of colon cancer evidenced by numerous complaints of the GI tract and insistence that something is wrong despite objectivetests that rule out pathophysiolog y . a.Short-Term Goal: Client will verbalize that fears asso-ciated with bodily sensations are irrational. b.Long-Term Goal: Client interprets bodily sensationscorrectly. 2.Chronic low self-esteem related to unfulfilled childhood needs for nur turing and caring evidenced by transforma- tion of internalized anger into physical complaints andhostility toward others. a.Shor t-Term Goal: Within 2 weeks, client will verbalize aspects about self that he likes. b.Long-Term Goal: By discharge from treatment, client will demonstrate acceptance of self as a person ofworth, as evidenced by setting realistic goals, limiting Continued4092_Ch29_581-607 23/07/14 12:37 PM Page 603604 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation C A S E S T U D Y A N D S A M P L E C A R E P L A N \u2014cont'd physical complaints and hostility toward others, and verbalizing positive prospects for the future. PLANNING/IMPLEMENTATION FEAR (OF CANCER RECURRENCE) The following nursing interventions have been identifiedfor Jake: 1.Monitor the physician's ongoing assessments and laboratory repor ts to ensure that patholog y is clearly ruled out. 2.Refer any new physical complaints to the physician. 3.Assess what function these physical complaints are fulfilling for Jake. Is it a way for him to get attention thathe can't get in any other way? 4.Show empathy for his feelings. Let him know that youunderstand how GI symptoms may bring about fearsof the colon cancer . 5.Encourage Jake to talk about his fears of cancer recur-rence. W hat feelings did he have when it was first diag- nosed? How did he deal with those feelings? W hat are his fears at this time? 6.Have Jake keep a diary of the appearance of the symp-toms. In a separate diary , have Jake keep a record of situations that create stress for him. Compare these tworecords. Correlate whether symptoms appear at timesof increased anxiety . 7.Help Jake determine what techniques may be usefulfor him to implement when fear and anxiety are exac-erbated (e.g., rela xation techniques, mental imagery , thought-stopping techniques, physical exercise). 8.Offer positive feedback when Jake responds to stressfulsituations with coping strateg ies other than physical complaints. CHRONIC LOW SELF-ESTEEM The following nursing interventions have been identifiedfor Jake: 1.Convey acceptance, unconditional positive regard, and remain nonjudgmental at all times. 2.Encourage Jake to participate in decision-making regard-ing his care, as well as in life situations.3.Help Jake to recognize and focus on strengths and accomplishments. Minimize attention g i ven to past (real or perceived) failures. 4.Encourage Jake to talk about feelings related to his un-satisfactory relationship with his parents. 5.Discuss things in his life that Jake would like to change.Help him determine what can be changed and what changes are not realistic. 6.Encourage participation in group activities and in ther-apy g roups that offer simple methods of achievement. Give recognition and positive feedback for actual accomplishments. 7.Teach assertiveness techniques and effective communi-cation techniques. 8.Offer positive feedback for appropriate social interactionswith others. Role-play with Jake situations that he findsparticularly stressful. Help him to understand that rumi- nations about himself and his health may cause othersto reject him socially . 9.Help Jake to set realistic goals for his future. EVALUATION Some of the outcome criteria for Jake have been met, andsome are ongoing. He has come to realize that the fearsabout his \"symptoms\" are not rational. He understands thatthe physician has performed adequate diagnostic proce-dures to rule out illness. He still has fears of cancer occur-rence, and discusses these fears with the nurse practitioneron a weekly basis. He has kept his symptoms/stressful situ-ations diary, and has correlated the appearance of some ofthe symptoms to times of increased anxiety. He has startedrunning, and tries to use this as a strategy to keep the anxietyfrom escalating out of proportion and bringing on new phys-ical symptoms. He continues to discuss feelings associatedwith his childhood, and the nurse has helped him see thathe has had numerous accomplishments in his life, eventhough they were not recognized by his parents or others.He has joined a support group for depressed persons, andstates that he \"has made a few friends.\" He has made a long-term goal of joining a church with the hope of meeting newpeople. He is missing fewer workdays because of illness, andhis job is no longer in jeopardy. Summary and Key Points Somatic symptom disorders and dissociative disor- ders are associated with anxiety that occurs at thesevere level. The anxiety is repressed and mani-fested in the form of symptoms and behaviors associated with these disorders. Somatic symptom disorders, known historically ashysteria, affect about 5 to 7 percent of the generalpopulation. Types of somatic symptom disorders include somatic symptom disorder, illness anxietydisorder, conversion disorder, psychological factorsaffecting other medical conditions, factitious dis-order, and other specified or unspecified somaticsymptom disorders. Somatic symptom disorder is manifested by physicalsymptoms that may be vague, dramatized, or exag-gerated in their presentation. No evidence of organicpathology can be identified. Illness anxiety disorder is an unrealistic preoccupa-tion with fear of having a serious illness. This disorder may follow a personal experience, or the4092_Ch29_581-607 23/07/14 12:37 PM Page 604experience of a close family member, with serious or life-threatening illness. The individual with conversion disorder experiencesa loss of or alteration in bodily functioning, unsub-stantiated by medical or pathophysiological expla-nation. Psychological factors may be evident by theprimary or secondary gains the individual achievesfrom experiencing the physiological manifestation. With the diagnosis of psychological factors affectingother medical conditions, psychological or behavioralfactors have been implicated in the development, exacerbation, or delayed recovery from a medicalcondition. In factitious disorder, the individual falsifies physi-cal or psychological signs or symptoms, or inducesinjury, on the self or another person in order to receive attention from medical personnel. A dissociative response has been described as a defense mechanism to protect the ego in the faceof overwhelming anxiety. Dissociative responses result in an alteration in thenormally integrative functions of identity, memory,or consciousness. Classification of dissociative disorders includes disso-ciative amnesia, dissociative disorder (DID),depersonalization-derealization disorders.The individual with dissociative amnesia is unableto recall important personal information that is tooextensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness. The prominent feature of DID is the existence oftwo or more personalities within a single individ-ual. An individual may have many personalities,each of which serves a purpose for that individualof enduring painful stimuli that the original per-sonality is too weak to face. Depersonalization-derealization disorder is character-ized by an alteration in the perception of oneselfand/or the environment. Depersonalization is de-scribed as a feeling of unreality or detachment fromone's body. Derealization is an experience of unrealityor detachment with respect to one's surroundings. Individuals with somatic symptom and dissociativedisorders often receive health care initially in areasother than psychiatry. Nurses can assist clients with these disorders byhelping them to understand their problem andidentify and establish new, more adaptive behaviorpatterns.CHAPTER 29 Somatic Symptom and Dissociative Disorders 605 Additional info available at www.davisplus.com Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

The owner of a localbar called the police when Tom suddenly seemed to \"lose control.He just went ballistic.\" The police reported that Tom did not knowwhere he was or how he got there. He kept saying, \"My name isJohn Brown, and I live in Philadelphia.\" When the police ran an iden-tity check on Tom, they found that he was indeed John Brown fromPhiladelphia and his wife had reported him missing a month ago.Mrs. Brown explained that about 12 months before his disappear-ance, her husband, who was a shop foreman at a large manufac-turing plant, had been having considerable difficulty at work. He hadbeen passed over for a promotion, and his supervisor had beenvery critical of his work. Several of his staff had left the company forother jobs, and without enough help, Tom had been unable to meetshop deadlines. Work stress made him very difficult to live with athome. Previously an easygoing, extroverted individual, he becamewithdrawn and extremely critical of his wife and children.

It reflects thetotality of the person and does not relate exclusively tothe sex organs or sexual behavior. Development of Human Sexuality Birth Through Age 12 Although the sexual identity of an infant is deter- mined before birth by chromosomal factors and phys-ical appearance of the genitals, postnatal factors cangreatly influence the way developing children per-ceive themselves sexually. Masculinity and femininity,as well as gender roles, are for the most part culturallydefined. For example, differentiation of roles may beinitiated at birth by painting a child's room pink orblue and by clothing the child in frilly, delicate dressesor tough, sturdy rompers. It is not uncommon for infants to touch and ex- plore their genitals. In fact, research on infantile sex-uality indicates that both male and female infants arecapable of sexual arousal and orgasm (Berman & Berman, 2005). By age 2 or 2 1/2years, children know what gender they are. They know that they are like the parent ofthe same gender and different from the parent of theopposite gender and from other children of the op-posite gender. They become acutely aware of anatom-ical gender differences during this time. By age 4 or 5, children engage in heterosexual play. \"Playing doctor\" can be a popular game at thisage. Through heterosexual play, children form a con-cept of marriage to a member of the opposite gender. Children increasingly gain experience with mastur- bation during childhood, although certainly not allchildren masturbate during this period. Most childrenbegin self-exploration and genital self-stimulation assoon as they are able to gain sufficient control overtheir physical movements (King, 2011). Late childhood and preadolescence may be char- acterized by heterosexual or homosexual play. Gen-erally the activity involves no more than touching theother's genitals, but may include a wide range of sex-ual behaviors (Masters, Johnson, & Kolodny, 1995).Girls at this age become interested in menstruation,and both genders are interested in learning about fer-tility, pregnancy, and birth. Interest in the oppositegender increases. Children of this age become self-conscious about their bodies and are concerned withphysical attractiveness. Children ages 10 to 12 are preoccupied with pu- bertal changes and the beginnings of romantic sexualattraction. Prepubescent boys may engage in groupsexual activities such as genital exhibition or groupmasturbation. Homosexual sex play is not uncom-mon. Prepubescent girls may engage in some genitalexhibition but they are usually not as preoccupiedwith the genitalia as are boys of this age. Adolescence Adolescence represents an acceleration in terms ofbiological changes and psychosocial and sexual devel-opment. This time of turmoil is nurtured by awaken-ing endocrine forces and a new set of psychosocialtasks to undertake. Included in these tasks are issuesrelating to sexuality, such as how to deal with new ormore powerful sexual feelings, whether to participatein various types of sexual behavior, how to recognizelove, how to prevent unwanted pregnancy, and howto define age-appropriate gender roles.Humans are sexual beings. Sexuality is a basic humanneed and an innate part of the total personality. It in-fluences our thoughts, actions, and interactions, andis involved in aspects of physical and mental health. Society's attitude toward sexuality is changing. Clients are more open to seeking assistance in mattersthat pertain to sexuality. Although not all nurses needto be educated as sex therapists, they can readily in-tegrate information on sexuality into the care theygive by focusing on preventive, therapeutic, and edu-cational interventions to assist individuals to attain,regain, or maintain sexual wellness. This chapter focuses on disorders associated with sexual functioning and gender dysphoria. Primaryconsideration is given to the categories of paraphilicdisorders and sexual dysfunctions as classified in theDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Associa- tion [APA], 2013). An overview of human sexual de-velopment throughout the life span is presented.Historical and epidemiological information associ-ated with sexual disorders is included. Predisposingfactors that have been implicated in the etiology ofsexual disorders and gender dysphoria provide aframework for studying the dynamics of these condi-tions. Various medical treatment modalities are explored. A discussion of variations in sexual orienta-tion is included. Various types of sexually transmitteddiseases (STDs) are described, and an explanation ofthe consequences of each is presented. Symptomatology is presented as background knowledge for assessing clients with sexual disordersand gender dysphoria. A tool for acquiring a sexualhistory is included. Nursing care is described in thecontext of the nursing process.4092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 609Biologically, puberty begins for the female adoles- cent with breast enlargement, widening of the hips, and growth of pubic and ancillary hair. The onset ofmenstruation usually occurs between the ages of 11and 13 years. In the male adolescent, growth of pubichair and enlargement of the testicles begin at 12 to16 years of age. Penile growth and the ability to ejac-ulate usually occur from the ages of 13 to 17. Thereis a marked growth of the body between ages 11 and17, accompanied by the growth of body and facialhair, increased muscle mass, and a deeper voice. Sexuality is slower to develop in the female than in the male adolescent. Women show steady increases insexual responsiveness that peak in their middle 20s orearly 30s. Sexual maturity for men is usually reachedin the late teens, but their sexual drive remains high through young adulthood (Murray, Zentner, &Yakimo, 2009). Masturbation is a common sexual ac-tivity among male and female adolescents. Many individuals have their first experience with sexual intercourse during the adolescent years. Al-though studies indicate a variety of statistics relatedto incidence of adolescent coitus, three notabletrends have become evident: 1.More adolescents are engaging in premarital intercourse. 2.The incidence of premarital intercourse for girlshas increased. 3.The average age of first intercourse has decreased. The most recent data collected on this topic by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)indicated that there is a trend toward safer sex amongadolescents. The survey revealed that, among those who reported being sexually active, condom use has increased since 2001 (CDC, 2012b). The American culture has ambivalent feelings about adolescent sexuality . Psychosexual develop- ment is desired, but most parents want to avoid any-thing that may encourage teenage sex. The rise innumber of cases of STDs, some of which are life-threatening, also contributes to fears associated withunprotected sexual activity in all age groups. In June 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administra- tion (FDA) licensed Gardasil, the first vaccine devel-oped to prevent cervical cancer and other diseasescaused by certain strains of human papillomavirus(HPV). A second vaccine, Cervarix, was approved bythe FDA in October 2009. If administered prior to ex-posure to the sexually transmitted virus, these vac-cines can protect women from ultimately developingcervical cancer caused by these specific strains. TheCDC recommends routine administration of the vac-cine to all girls ages 11 or 12 years with 3 doses of ei-ther vaccine (CDC, 2012a). The vaccine is alsorecommended for girls and women ages 13 through26 years who have not already received the vaccine orhave not completed all booster shots. In October2011, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immuniza-tion Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use ofthe quadrivalent vaccine, Gardasil, in males aged 11or 12 years (CDC, 2011). The ACIP also recom-mended vaccination for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously orwho have not completed the 3-dose series; males aged22 through 26 years may also be vaccinated. Somestate legislatures have proposed making administra-tion of the HPV vaccine mandatory for girls ages 9 to12 years. However, some parents believe these typesof laws circumvent their rights, and may send the mes-sage that these young women are protected andtherefore promote promiscuity. One recent study re-garding this issue indicates that this concern is un-founded (Bednarczyk, Davis, Ault, Orenstein, &Omer, 2012). These researchers found that HPV vac-cination in the recommended age group was not associated with increased sexual-activity-related out-come rates. Currently the controversy is ongoing, withsupporters of a mandate saying that states have a rare opportunity to fight a cancer that kills 3,700American women every year, and it must be given before a woman has been infected with the virus tobe effective. But opponents say states\u2014and parents\u2014should be trying to prevent premarital sex instead ofrequiring a vaccination with the assumption that it isgoing to happen. Adulthood This period of the life cycle begins at approximately 20 years of age and continues to age 65. Sexuality asso-ciated with ages 65 and older is discussed in Chapter 34. Marital Sex Choosing a marital partner or developing a sexual re-lationship with another individual is one of the majortasks in the early years of this life-cycle stage. Currentcultural perspective reflects that the institution ofmarriage has survived. About 80 to 90 percent of allpeople in the United States marry, and of those whodivorce, a high percentage remarries. Intimacy inmarriage is one of the most common forms of sexualexpression for adults. The average American couplehas coitus about two or three times per week whenthey are in their 20s, with the frequency gradually de-clining to about once weekly for those 45 years of ageand over. Many adults continue to masturbate eventhough they are married and have ready access to het-erosexual sex. This behavior is perfectly normal, al-though it often evokes feelings of guilt and may bekept secret.610 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 610CHAPTER 30 Issues Related to Human Sexuality and Gender Dysphoria 611 Extramarital Sex A number of studies present various results for surveys of extramarital sex. The estimates are that about one-third of married men and one-fourth of marriedwomen have engaged in extramarital sex at sometime during their marriages (King, 2011). Althoughthe incidence of extramarital sex for men seems to beholding constant, some evidence exists to suggest thatthe incidence for women may be increasing. Although attitudes toward premarital sex have changed substantially during the last several decades,attitudes toward extramarital sex have remained rela-tively stable. Most women and men say they believe sex-ual exclusivity should be a goal in marriage, althoughthey were less certain about what would happen if theirpartner did not live up to that ideal. Some estimatesplace the incidence of divorce caused by infidelity oradultery at around 20 percent of all divorce cases. Sex and the Single Person Attitudes about sexual intimacy among singles\u2014nevermarried, divorced, or widowed\u2014vary from individualto individual. Some single people will settle for anykind of relationship, casual or committed, that theybelieve will enrich their lives. Others deny any desirefor marriage or sexual intimacy, cherishing instead theindependence they retain by being \"unattached.\" Stillothers may search desperately for a spouse, with thedesperation increasing as the years wear on. Most divorced men and women return to having an active sex life following separation from theirspouse. More widowed men than widowed women re-turn to an active sex life after the loss of their partner.This may have in part to do with the fact that menchoose women partners younger than themselves,and because widows outnumber widowers by morethan 3 to 1 (Administration on Aging, 2014). The \"Middle\" Years\u201440 to 65 With the advent of the middle years, a decrease inhormonal production initiates a number of changesin the sex organs, as well as the rest of the body. Theaverage age of onset of menopause for the woman isaround 50, although changes can be noted fromabout 40 to 60 years of age. Approximately 1 percentof women experience symptoms as early as age 35(Murray et al., 2009). The decrease in the amount ofestrogen can result in loss of vaginal lubrication,making intercourse painful. Other symptoms may in-clude insomnia, \"hot flashes,\" headaches, heart pal-pitations, and depression. Hormonal supplementsmay alleviate some of these symptoms, although con-troversy currently exists within the medical commu-nity regarding the safety of hormone replacementtherapy.With the decrease of androgen production during these years, men also experience sexual changes. Theamount of ejaculate may decrease, and ejaculation maybe less forceful. The testes decrease in size, and erections may be less frequent and less rigid. By age 50,the refractory period increases, and men may require8 to 24 hours after orgasm before another erection canbe achieved. Biological drives decrease, and interest in sexual activity may decrease during these \"middle\" years. Al-though men need longer stimulation to reach orgasmand intensity of pleasure may decrease, women stabi-lize at the same level of sexual activity as at the previ-ous stage in the life cycle and often have a greatercapacity for orgasm in middle adulthood than inyoung adulthood (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Murrayand associates (2009) state: The enjoyment of sexual relations in younger years, rather than the frequency, is a key factor for mainte-nance of desire and activity in females, whereas fre-quency of relations and enjoyment are importantfactors for males. (p. 561) Sexual Disorders Paraphilic Disorders The term paraphilia is used to identify repetitive or preferred sexual fantasies or behaviors that involve (1) nonhuman objects, (2) suffering or humiliationof oneself or one's partner, or (3) nonconsenting per-sons (Black & Andreasen, 2011). In a paraphilic disorder, these sexual fantasies or be- haviors are recurrent over a period of at least 6months and cause the individual clinically significantdistress or impairment in social, occupational, orother important areas of functioning (APA, 2013). Historical Aspects Historically, some restrictions on human sexual ex-pression have always existed. Under the code of Or-thodox Judaism, masturbation was punishable bydeath. In ancient Catholicism it was considered a car-nal sin. In the late 19th century, masturbation wasviewed as a major cause of insanity. The sexual exploitation of children was con- demned in ancient cultures, as it continues to betoday. Incest remains the one taboo that crosses cul-tural barriers. It was punishable by death in Babylo-nia, Judea, and ancient China, and offenders weregiven the death penalty as late as 1650 in England. Oral-genital, anal, homosexual, and animal sexual contacts were viewed by the early Christian church asunnatural and, in fact, were considered greater trans-gressions than extramarital sexual activity becausethey did not lead to biological reproduction.4092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 611612 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation Requirement of the fetish object for sexual arousal may become so intense in some individuals that to be without it may result in impotence. Onset of the dis-order usually occurs during adolescence. The disorder is chronic, and the complication arises when the individual becomes progressivelymore intensely aroused by sexual behaviors that ex-clude a sexual partner. The person with the fetish andhis partner may become so distant that the partnereventually terminates the relationship. Frotteuristic Disorder Frotteuristic disorder is the recurrent and intense sex- ual arousal (manifested by urges, behaviors, or fan-tasies of at least 6 months' duration) involvingtouching or rubbing against a nonconsenting person(APA, 2013). Sexual excitement is derived from theactual touching or rubbing, not from the coercive na-ture of the act. Almost without exception, the genderof the frotteur is male. The individual usually chooses to commit the act in crowded places, such as on buses or subways during rushhour. In this way, he can provide rationalization for hisbehavior, should someone complain, and can more eas-ily escape arrest. The frotteur waits in a crowd until heidentifies a victim, then he follows her and allows therush of the crowd to push him against her. He fantasizesa relationship with his victim while rubbing his genitalsagainst her thighs and buttocks or touching her geni-talia or breasts with his hands. He often escapes detec-tion because of the victim's initial shock and denial thatsuch an act has been committed in this public place. Pedophilic Disorder The essential feature of pedophilic disorder is sexual arousal from prepubescent or early pubescent chil-dren equal to or greater than that derived from phys-ically mature persons. DSM-5 criteria specify that the behavior has lasted at least 6 months and is mani-fested by fantasies or sexual urges on which the indi-vidual has acted, or which cause significant distress orimpairment in social, occupational, or other impor-tant areas of functioning (APA, 2013). The age of themolester is at least 16 years, and he or she is at least 5 years older than the child. This category of para-philic disorder is the most common of sexual assaults. Most child molestations involve genital fondling or oral sex. Vaginal or anal penetration of the child ismost common in cases of incest. Sexual abuse of achild may include a wide range of behaviors, includ-ing speaking to the child in a sexual manner, inde-cent exposure and masturbation in the presence ofthe child, and inappropriate touching or acts of pen-etration (oral, vaginal, and anal) (King, 2011). Onsetusually occurs during adolescence, and the disorderoften runs a chronic course.Epidemiological Statistics Relatively limited data exist on the prevalence orcourse of paraphilic disorders. Most available infor-mation has been obtained from studies of incarcer-ated sex offenders. Another source of informationhas been from outpatient psychiatric services for in-dividuals with paraphilic disorders outside the crimi-nal justice system. Because few individuals with paraphilic disorders ex- perience personal distress from their behavior, mostcome for treatment because of pressure from their part-ners or the authorities (Becker & Johnson, 2008). Datasuggest that most people with paraphilic disorders whoseek outpatient treatment do so for pedophilic disorder(45 percent), exhibitionistic disorder (25 percent), orvoyeuristic disorder (12 percent). Most individuals with paraphilic disorders are men, and the behavior is generally established in adoles-cence (Black & Andreasen, 2011). The behaviorpeaks between ages 15 and 25 and gradually declinesso that, by age 50, the occurrence of paraphilic acts isvery low, except for those behaviors that occur in iso-lation or with a cooperative partner. Some individualsexperience multiple paraphilic disorders. Types of Paraphilic Disorders The following types of paraphilic disorders are iden-tified by the DSM-5: Exhibitionistic Disorder Exhibitionistic disorder is characterized by recurrent and intense sexual arousal (manifested by fantasies,urges, or behaviors of at least 6 months' duration)from the exposure of one's genitals to an unsuspect-ing individual (APA, 2013). Masturbation may occurduring the exhibitionism. In most cases of exhibition-ism, the perpetrators are men and the victims arewomen (King, 2011). The urges for genital exposure intensify when the exhibitionist has excessive free time or is under signif-icant stress. Most people who engage in exhibitionismhave rewarding sexual relationships with adult part-ners but concomitantly expose themselves to others. Fetishistic Disorder Fetishistic disorder involves recurrent and intense sexual arousal (manifested by fantasies, urges, or be-haviors of at least 6 months' duration) from the useof either non-living objects or specific non-genitalbody part(s) (APA, 2013). A common sexual focus ison objects intimately associated with the human body(e.g., shoes, gloves, stockings). The fetish object isusually used during masturbation or incorporatedinto sexual activity with another person in order toproduce sexual excitation.4092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 612CHAPTER 30 Issues Related to Human Sexuality and Gender Dysphoria 613 excitement is achieved through the act of looking, and no contact with the person is attempted. Mas-turbation usually accompanies the \"window peep-ing\" but may occur later as the individual fantasizesabout the voyeuristic act. Onset of voyeuristic behavior commonly occurs during adolescence, but the minimum age for a diag-nosis of voyeuristic disorder is 18 years (APA, 2013).Many individuals who engage in this behavior enjoysatisfying sexual relationships with an adult partner.Few apprehensions occur because most targets ofvoyeurism are unaware that they are being observed. Predisposing Factors to Paraphilic Disorders Biological Factors Various studies have implicated several organic factorsin the etiology of paraphilic disorder. Destruction ofparts of the limbic system in animals has been shownto cause hypersexual behavior (Becker & Johnson,2008). Temporal lobe diseases, such as psychomotorseizures or temporal lobe tumors, have been impli-cated in some individuals with paraphilic disorder. Abnormal levels of androgens also may contribute toinappropriate sexual arousal. The majority of studieshave involved violent sex offenders, and the resultscannot accurately be generalized. Psychoanalytic Theory The psychoanalytic approach defines an individualwith paraphilic disorder as one who has failed thenormal developmental process toward heterosexualadjustment (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). This occurswhen the individual fails to resolve the Oedipal crisisand either identifies with the parent of the oppositegender or selects an inappropriate object for libidocathexis. Becker and Johnson (2008) offered the fol-lowing explanation: Severe castration anxiety during the Oedipal phase of development leads to the substitution of a symbolicobject (inanimate or an anatomic part) for themother, as in fetishism and transvestitism. Similarly,anxiety over arousal to the mother can lead to thechoice of \"safe,\" inappropriate sexual partners, as inpedophilia and zoophilia, or safe sexual behaviors inwhich there is no sexual contact, as in exhibitionismand voyeurism. (p. 740) Behavioral Theory The behavioral model hypothesizes that whether or not an individual engages in paraphilic behavior de-pends on the type of reinforcement he or she receivesfollowing the behavior. The initial act may be commit-ted for various reasons. Some examples include recall-ing memories of experiences from an individual's earlylife (especially the first shared sexual experience),Sexual Masochism Disorder The identifying feature of sexual masochism disorderis recurrent and intense sexual arousal (manifested byurges, behaviors, or fantasies of at least 6 months' du-ration) from the act of being humiliated, beaten,bound, or otherwise made to suffer (APA, 2013). Thesemasochistic activities may be fantasized (e.g., beingraped) and may be performed alone (e.g., self-inflictedpain) or with a partner (e.g., being restrained, spanked,or beaten by the partner). Some masochistic activitieshave resulted in death, in particular those that involvesexual arousal by oxygen deprivation. The disorder isusually chronic and can progress to the point at whichthe individual cannot achieve sexual satisfaction with-out masochistic fantasies or activities. Sexual Sadism Disorder The DSM-5 identifies the essential feature of sexual sadism disorder as recurrent and intense sexual arousal (manifested by urges, behaviors, or fantasiesof at least 6 months' duration) from the physical orpsychological suffering of another individual (APA,2013). The sadistic activities may be fantasized oracted on with a consenting or nonconsenting partner.In all instances, sexual excitation occurs in responseto the suffering of the victim. Examples of sadistic actsinclude restraint, beating, burning, rape, cutting, tor-ture, and even killing. The course of the disorder is usually chronic, with the severity of the sadistic acts often increasing overtime. Activities with nonconsenting partners are usu-ally terminated by legal apprehension. Transvestic Disorder Transvestic disorder involves recurrent and intense sexual arousal (as manifested by fantasies, urges, orbehaviors of at least 6 months' duration) from dress-ing in the clothes of the opposite gender. The individ-ual is commonly a heterosexual man who keeps acollection of women's clothing that he intermittentlyuses to dress in when alone. The sexual arousal maybe produced by an accompanying fantasy of the indi-vidual as a woman with female genitalia, or merely bythe view of himself fully clothed as a woman withoutattention to the genitalia. The disorder causes markeddistress to the individual, or interferes with social, oc-cupational, or other important areas of functioning. Voyeuristic Disorder Voyeuristic disorder is identified by recurrent and intense sexual arousal (manifested by urges, behav-iors, or fantasies of at least at least 6 months' dura-tion) involving the act of observing an unsuspectingindividual who is naked, in the process of disrobing,or engaging in sexual activity (APA, 2013). Sexual4092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 613modeling behavior of others who have carried out paraphilic acts, mimicking sexual behavior depicted inthe media, and recalling past trauma such as one's ownmolestation (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Once the initial act has been committed, the indi- vidual with paraphilic disorder consciously evaluatesthe behavior and decides whether to repeat it. A fearof punishment or perceived harm or injury to the vic-tim, or a lack of pleasure derived from the experi-ence, may extinguish the behavior. However, whennegative consequences do not occur, when the act it-self is highly pleasurable, or when the person with theparaphilic disorder immediately escapes and therebyavoids seeing any negative consequences experiencedby the victim, the activity is more likely to be repeated. Transactional Model of Stress/Adaptation One model alone is probably not sufficient to explainthe etiology of paraphilic disorders. It is most likelythat the integration of learning experiences, sociocul-tural factors, and biological processes must occur toaccount for these deviant sexual behaviors. A combi-nation of biological, psychosocial, and cultural fac-tors, along with aspects of the learning paradigmpreviously described, probably provides the mostcomprehensive etiological explanation for paraphilicdisorders to date. In Figure 30-1, a graphic depictionof the theory of multiple causation is presented in theTransactional Model of Stress/Adaptation. Treatment Modalities for Paraphilic Disorders Biological Treatment Biological treatment of individuals with paraphilic dis-orders has focused on blocking or decreasing thelevel of circulating androgens. The most extensivelyused of the antiandrogenic medications are the prog-estin derivatives that block testosterone synthesis orblock androgen receptors. They do not influence thedirection of sexual drive toward appropriate adultpartners. Instead they act to decrease libido, and thusbreak the individual's pattern of compulsive deviantsexual behavior (Becker & Johnson, 2008). They arenot meant to be the sole source of treatment andwork best when given in conjunction with participa-tion in individual or group psychotherapy. Psychoanalytic Therapy Psychoanalytic approaches have been tried in the treat-ment of paraphilic disorders. In this type of therapy, thetherapist helps the client to identify unresolved conflictsand traumas from early childhood. The therapy focuseson helping the individual resolve these early conflicts,thus relieving the anxiety that prevents him or her fromforming appropriate sexual relationships. In turn theindividual has no further need for paraphilic fantasies.Behavior Therapy Aversion techniques have been used to modify unde-sirable behavior. Aversion therapy methods in thetreatment of paraphilic disorders involve pairing nox-ious stimuli, such as electric shocks and bad odors,with the impulse, which then diminishes. Behavioraltherapy also includes skills training and cognitive re-structuring in an effort to change the individual's mal-adaptive beliefs. Other behavioral approaches to decreasing inap- propriate sexual arousal have included covert sen-sitization and satiation. With covert sensitization,the individual combines inappropriate sexual fan-tasies with aversive, anxiety-provoking scenes underthe guidance of the therapist (Becker & Johnson,2008). Satiation is a technique in which the postor-gasmic individual repeatedly fantasizes deviant be-haviors to the point of saturation with the deviantstimuli, consequently making the fantasies and be-havior unexciting. Role of the Nurse Treatment of the person with a paraphilic disorder isoften very frustrating for both the client and the ther-apist. Most individuals with paraphilic disorders denythat they have a problem and seek psychiatric careonly after their inappropriate behavior comes to theattention of others. In secondary prevention, thefocus is to diagnose and treat the problem as early aspossible to minimize difficulties. These individualsshould be referred to specialists who are accustomedto working with this special population. Nursing may best become involved in the primary prevention process. The focus of primary preventionin sexual disorders is to intervene in home life or otherfacets of childhood in an effort to prevent problemsfrom developing. An additional concern of primaryprevention is to assist in the development of adaptivecoping strategies to deal with stressful life situations. Three major components of sexual development have been identified: (1) gender identity (one's senseof maleness or femaleness), (2) sexual responsiveness(arousal to appropriate stimuli), and (3) the abilityto establish relationships with others. A disturbancein one or more of these components may lead to a va-riety of sexual deviations. Different developmental components seem to be disturbed in the various sexual deviations. For exam-ple, gender identity may be disturbed in transvesticdisorder. The second component, sexual responsive-ness to appropriate stimuli, may be disturbed in thecase of the individual with fetishistic disorder. In thecase of individuals with exhibitionistic or the frot-teuristic disorders, the ability to form relationshipsmay be disturbed.614 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 614CHAPTER 30 Issues Related to Human Sexuality and Gender Dysphoria 615 Precipitating Event (Any event sufficiently stressful to threaten a fragile ego) Predisposing Factors Genetic Influences: Past Experiences: Existing Conditions:Limbic system or temporal lobe abnormalities Abnormal levels of androgensUnresolved Oedipal complex leading to identification with opposite-gender parent or object for libido cathexisLearned response through reinforcement of the behaviorNegative role modelingUnusual amount of stress or conflictDevelopmental regressionAbsence of support systemsPoor coping mechanisms * Primary * (Stress or conflict produces real or perceived threat to self-concept) * Secondary * Because of weak ego strength, patient is unable to use coping mechanisms effectively.Defense mechanisms utilized: denial, regression, repression, suppression, displacement, projection, rationalization.

FIGURE 30-1 The dynamics of paraphilic disorder using the Transactional Model of Stress/Adaptation. Sexual Dysfunctions The Sexual Response Cycle Because sexual dysfunctions occur as disturbances in any of the phases of the sexual response cycle, an un-derstanding of anatomy and physiology is a prerequi-site to considerations of pathology and treatment. Phase I\u2014Desire: During this phase, the desire to have sexual activity occurs in response to verbal,physical, or visual stimulation. Sexual fantasies canalso bring about this desire.Nurses can participate in the regular evaluation of these developmental components to ensure that aschildren mature, their development in each of thesethree components is healthy, thereby preventing de-viant sexual behaviors. Nurses who work in pediatrics,psychiatry, public health, ambulatory clinics, schools,and any other facility requiring contact with childrenmust be knowledgeable about human sexual develop-ment. Accurate assessment and early intervention bythese nurses can contribute a great deal toward pri-mary prevention of sexual disorders.4092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 615616 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation TABLE 30-1 Prevalence of Sexual Problems in Sexually Active Men and Women in the United States DISORDER MEN (%) WOMEN (%) Lack of sexual interest 18.1 33.2 Inability to reach orgasm 1 2.4 20.7 Pain during sex 3.1 12.7 Premature ejaculation 26.2 \u2014 Erectile difficulties 22.5 \u2014 Lubrication difficulties of sexual activity,sexual problems, and associated help-seeking behavior patterns in mature adults in the United States of America.

Knowledge exists only about those who seek some kind of treatment for theproblem, and they may be few in number comparedwith those who have a dysfunction but suffer quietlyand never seek therapy. In 1970, Masters and Johnson reported that 50 per- cent of all American couples suffered from some typeof sexual dysfunction. In 1984, Robins and coworkersestimated that 24 percent of the U.S. populationwould experience a sexual dysfunction at some timein their lives. Data related to prevalence of sexualproblems in the United States based on a recent sur-vey are presented in Table 30-1. This survey includeda total of 1,491 men and women ages 40 to 80, and lessthan 25 percent of the individuals had sought help fortheir sexual problem(s) from a health professional(Laumann, Glasser, Neves, & Moreira, 2009). Types of Sexual Dysfunction Erectile Disorder Erectile disorder is characterized by marked difficultyin obtaining or maintaining an erection during sexualactivity, or a decrease in erectile rigidity that interfereswith sexual activity (APA, 2013). The problem haspersisted for at least 6 months and causes the individ-ual significant distress. Primary erectile disorder refers to cases in which the man has never been able to haveintercourse; secondary erectile disorder refers to cases in which the man has difficulty getting or maintainingan erection but has been able to have vaginal or analintercourse at least once. Female Orgasmic Disorder Female orgasmic disorder is defined by the DSM-5 as a marked delay in, infrequency of, or absence of Phase II\u2014Excitement: This is the phase of sexual arousal and erotic pleasure. Physiological changesoccur. The male responds with penile tumescenceand erection. Female include vasoconges-tion in the and swellingof the external genitalia. Phase III\u2014Orgasm: Orgasm is identified as a peak-ing of sexual pleasure, with release of sexual ten-sion and rhythmic contraction of the perinealmuscles and reproductive organs (Black & Andreasen, 2011). Orgasm in women is marked bysimultaneous rhythmic contractions of the uterus,the lower third of the vagina, and the anal sphinc-ter. In the man, a forceful emission of semen oc-curs in response to rhythmic spasms of theprostate, seminal vesicles, vas, and urethra. Phase IV\u2014Resolution: If orgasm has occurred, this phase is characterized by disgorgement of bloodfrom the genitalia, creating a sense of general re-laxation and well-being. If orgasm is not achieved,resolution may take several hours, producing pelvicdiscomfort and a feeling of irritability. After orgasm, men experience a refractory period that may last from a few minutes to many hours, dur-ing which time they cannot be stimulated to furtherorgasm. Commonly, the length of the refractory pe-riod increases with age. Because women have no re-fractory period, they may be capable of multiple andsuccessive orgasms (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Historical and Epidemiological Aspects Related to Sexual Dysfunction Concurrent with the cultural changes occurring dur- ing the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s camean increase in scientific research into sexual physiol-ogy and sexual dysfunctions. Masters and Johnson(1966, 1970) pioneered this work with their studieson human sexual response and the treatment of sex-ual dysfunctions. Spear (2001) reports: Sex therapy, the treatment of sexual disorders, has evolved from early studies on sexual behavior madeover 50 years ago. During these 50 years, the ap-proach to sex therapy has changed immensely. WhenWilliam Masters and Virginia Johnson publishedHuman Sexual Inadequacy in 1970, the sexual revolu- tion, born in the 1960s, was not yet in full force. Duein part to the development of the oral contraceptiveknown as 'the pill' and the rise in the politics of fem-inism, society began to take a different, more openview of sexuality. The rise in sex therapy addressed[sexual] issues as they had never been addressed be-fore, in the privacy of a doctor's office. Sexual dysfunction consists of an impairment or disturbance in any of the phases of the sexual re- sponse cycle. No one knows exactly how many people4092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 616CHAPTER 30 Issues Related to Human Sexuality and Gender Dysphoria 617 Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder This disorder is defined by the DSM-5 as a persistent or recurrent deficiency or absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity. In making the judgmentof deficiency or absence, the clinician considers fac-tors that affect sexual functioning, such as age andcircumstances of the person's life (APA, 2013). Thecondition has persisted for at least 6 months andcauses the individual significant distress. An individual's absolute level of sexual desire may not be the problem; rather, the problem may be a dis-crepancy between the partners' levels. The conflictmay occur if one partner wants to have sexual rela-tions more often than the other does. Care must betaken not to label one partner as pathological whenthe problem actually lies in the discrepancy of sexualdesire between the partners. Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder With this disorder, the individual experiences consid-erable difficulty with vaginal intercourse and attemptsat penetration. Pain is felt in the vagina, around thevaginal entrance and clitoris, or deep in the pelvis.There is fear and anxiety associated with anticipationof pain or vaginal penetration. A tensing and tighten-ing of the pelvic floor muscles occurs during attemptedvaginal penetration (APA, 2013). The condition maybe lifelong (present since the individual became sexu- ally active) or acquired (began after a period of relatively normal sexual function). It has persisted for at least 6months and causes the individual clinically significantdistress. Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction With these disorders, the sexual dysfunction devel- oped after substance intoxication or withdrawal orafter exposure to a medication (APA, 2013). The dys-function may involve pain, impaired desire, impairedarousal, or impaired orgasm. Some substances/medications that can interfere with and others. Predisposing Factors to Sexual Dysfunction Biological Factors Sexual Desire Disorders Studies have correlated de-creased levels of serum testosterone with hypoactivesexual desire disorder in men. Evidence also exists thatsuggests a relationship between higher serum testos-terone levels and increased female libido (Traish & Kim, 2006). Diminished libido has been obser ved in both men and women with elevated levels of serumprolactin (Nappi, Ferdeghini, & Polatti, 2006). Variousorgasm during sexual activity (APA, 2013). It may alsobe characterized by a reduced intensity of orgasmicsensation. The condition, which is sometimes re-ferred to as anorgasmia, has lasted at least 6 months, and causes the individual significant distress. Womenwho can achieve orgasm through noncoital clitoralstimulation but are not able to experience it duringcoitus in the absence of manual clitoral stimulationare not necessarily categorized as anorgasmic. A woman is considered to have primary orgasmic disor- derwhen she has never experienced orgasm by any kind of stimulation. Secondary orgasmic disorder exists if the woman has experienced at least one orgasm, regardlessof the means of stimulation, but no longer does so. Delayed Ejaculation Delayed ejaculation is characterized by marked delay in ejaculation or marked infrequency or absence of ejac-ulation during partnered sexual activity (APA, 2013).The condition has lasted for at least 6 months andcauses the individual significant distress. With this dis-order, the man is unable to ejaculate, even though hehas a firm erection and has had more than adequatestimulation. The severity of the problem may rangefrom only occasional problems ejaculating ( secondary disorder) to a history of never having experienced an or-gasm (primary disorder). In the most common version,the man cannot ejaculate during coitus but may be ableto ejaculate as a result of other types of stimulation. Premature (Early) Ejaculation The DSM- 5describes premature (early) ejaculation as persistent or recurrent ejaculation occurring within1 minute of beginning partnered sexual activity andbefore the person wishes it (APA, 2013). The condi-tion has lasted at least 6 months and causes the indi-vidual significant distress. The diagnosis should takeinto account factors that affect the duration of the ex-citement phase, such as the person's age, the unique-ness of the sexual partner, and frequency of sexualactivity (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Premature (early) ejaculation is the most common sex- ual disorder for which men seek treatment. It is particu-larly common among young men who have a very highsex drive and have not yet learned to control ejaculation. Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder This disorder is characterized by a reduced or absentinterest or pleasure in sexual activity (APA, 2013).The individual typically does not initiate sexual activ-ity, and is commonly unreceptive to partner's at-tempts to initiate. There is an absence of sexualthoughts or fantasies, and absent or reduced arousalin response to sexual or erotic cues. The conditionhas persisted for at least 6 months and causes the in-dividual significant distress.4092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 617618 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation Conversely, some report increased sexual activity and decreased sexual dysfunction following hysterec-tomy (Rhodes, Kjerulff, Langenberg, & Guzinski,1999). Studies of the use of transdermal testosteronefor sexual dysfunction in women after hysterectomyhave revealed mixed results (Nappi et al., 2005).Some medications (e.g., selective serotonin reuptakeinhibitors) may inhibit orgasm. Medical conditions,such as depression, hypothyroidism, and diabetesmellitus, may cause decreased sexual arousal and orgasm. Biological factors associated with delayed male orgasm include surgery of the genitourinary tract(e.g., prostatectomy), various neurological disor-ders (e.g., Parkinson's disease), and other diseases(e.g., diabetes mellitus). Medications that have been implicated include opioids, antihypertensives,antidepressants, and antipsychotics (Altman & Hanfling, 2003). Transient cases of the disorder may occur with excessive alcohol intake. Although premature ejaculation is commonly caused by psychological factors, general medicalconditions or substance use may also be contributinginfluences. Particularly in cases of secondary dys-function, in which a man at one time had ejaculatorycontrol but later lost it, physical factors may be in-volved. Examples include a local infection such asprostatitis or a degenerative neural disorder such asmultiple sclerosis.medications have also been implicated in the etiologyof disorder. Some and anticonvulsants. Alcohol and co-caine have also been associated with impaired desire,especially after chronic use. Sexual Arousal Disorders Postmenopausal women re- quire a longer period of stimulation for lubrication to occur , and there is generally less vaginal transudate after menopause (Altman & Hanfling, 2003). V arious medications, particularly those with antihistaminicand anticholinergic properties, may also contribute todecreased ability for arousal in women. Arteriosclero-sis is a common cause of male erectile disorder as a re-sult of arterial insufficiency (King, 2011). Variousneurological disorders can contribute to erectile dys-functions as well. The most common neurologicallybased cause may be diabetes, which places men at highrisk for neuropathy (Kim & Brosman, 2013). Othersinclude temporal lobe epilepsy and multiple sclerosis.Trauma (e.g., spinal cord injury, pelvic cancer surgery)can also result in erectile disorder. Several medicationshave been implicated in the etiology of this disorder,including antihypertensives, antipsychotics, antide-pressants, and anxiolytics. Chronic use of alcohol hasalso been shown to be a contributing factor. Orgasmic Disorders Some women report decreased ability to achieve orgasm following hysterectomy. IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE E.B. (2003). Sexual function in menolder than 50 years of age: Results from the health profes-sionals follow-up study. Annals of Internal Medicine, 139(3), 161-168. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: The purpose of the Health Professionals F ollow-up Study was to describe the association between age and several aspects of sexual functioning in menolder than 5 0 years of age. Participants included 31,742 male dentists, optometrists, osteopaths, podiatrists, pharmacists, andveterinarians in the United States. The participants were mailedquestionnaires every 2 years between 1986 and 2000. Agerange of participants was 53 to 90 years. Measures of sexualfunction included ability to have and maintain an erection adequate for intercourse, sexual desire, and ability to reach orgasm. Independent modifiable health behaviors includedphysical activity, smoking, obesity, alcohol consumption, andsedentary lifestyle (measured by hours of TV viewing). RESULTS OF THE STUDY: The results of this study reinforced those of previous studies that linked sexual dysfunction to increasing age, cer tain disease processes (e.g., dia- betes, cancer, stroke, and hypertension), and medications (e.g., antidepressants; beta-blockers). This study also ad-dressed more specifically the correlation between sexualdysfunction and independent, modifiable risk factors. Ahigher risk for sexual dysfunction was associated withobesity, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and excess alcoholconsumption. Regular physical exercise (>32 metabolicequivalent hours per week), leanness, moderate alcoholconsumption, and not smoking were statistically signifi-cant with decreased risk. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: This study has strong implications for nursing in terms of educating men over age 5 0 about contributing factors to sexual dysfunc- tion. Establishing and conducting classes for weight re-duction (including programs of regular exercise) andsmoking cessation are well within the scope of nursingpractice. Nurses can intervene to assist clients with be-havior modification to achieve and/or maintain sexualwellness.4092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 618CHAPTER 30 Issues Related to Human Sexuality and Gender Dysphoria 619 conditioning (\"nice girls don't enjoy sex\") may also influence the adult female's sexual response. Variousdevelopmental factors also have relevance to orgas-mic dysfunction. Examples include childhood expo-sure to rigid religious orthodoxy, negative familyattitudes toward nudity and sex, and traumatic sexualexperiences during childhood or adolescence, suchas incest or rape (Clayton, 2002; Phillips, 2000). Psychological factors are also associated with inhib- ited male orgasm (delayed ejaculation). In the pri-mary disorder (in which the man has neverexperienced orgasm), the man often comes from arigid, puritanical background. He perceives sex as sin-ful and the genitals as dirty, and he may have con-scious or unconscious incest wishes and guilt (Sadock& Sadock, 2007). In the case of secondary disorder(previously experienced orgasms that have nowstopped), interpersonal difficulties are usually impli-cated. There may be some ambivalence about com-mitment, fear of pregnancy, or unexpressed hostility. Premature (early) ejaculation may be related to a lack of physical awareness on the part of a sexually in-experienced man. The ability to control ejaculation oc-curs as a gradual maturing process with a sexual partnerin which foreplay becomes more give-and-take \"pleasur-ing,\" rather than strictly goal-oriented. The man be-comes aware of the sensations and learns to delay thepoint of ejaculatory inevitability. Relationship problemssuch as a stressful marriage, negative cultural condition-ing, anxiety over intimacy, and lack of comfort in thesexual relationship may also contribute to this disorder. Sexual Pain Disorders Penetration disorders may occur in response to having experienced genito-pelvic pain for various organic reasons stated in the \"BiologicalFactors\" section. Involuntary constriction within the vagina occurs in response to anticipatory pain, makingintercourse impossible. The diagnosis does not applyif the etiology is determined to be due to anothermedical condition. A variety of psychosocial factorshave been implicated, including negative childhoodconditioning of sex as dirty, sinful, and shameful. Earlytraumatic sexual experiences (e.g., rape or incest) mayalso cause penetration disorder. Other etiological fac-tors that may be important include homosexual ori-entation, traumatic experience with an early pelvicexamination, pregnancy phobia, STD phobia, or The etiology of sexual dysfunction is most likely influ-enced by multiple factors. In Figure 30-2, a graphic de-piction of the theory of multiple causation is presentedin the Transactional Model of Stress/Adaptation.Sexual Pain Disorders A number of organic factors cancontribute to painful intercourse in women, includ-ing intact hymen, episiotomy scar, vaginal or urinary tract infection, ligament injuries, endometriosis, orovarian cysts or tumors. Painful intercourse in menmay also be caused by various organic factors. For ex-ample, infection caused by poor hygiene under theforeskin of an uncircumcised man can cause pain.Phimosis, a condition in which the foreskin cannotbe pulled back, can also cause painful intercourse. Anallergic reaction to various vaginal spermicides or ir-ritation caused by vaginal infections may be a con-tributing factor. Finally, various prostate problemsmay cause pain on ejaculation. Psychosocial Factors Sexual Desire Disorders Phillips (2000) has identified anumber of individual and relationship factors that maycontribute to hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Individ- ual causes include religious orthodoxy; sexual identityconflicts; past sexual abuse; financial, family , or job problems; depression; and aging-related concerns (e.g.,changes in physical appearance). Among the relation-ship causes are interpersonal conflicts; current physical,verbal, or sexual abuse; extramarital affairs; and desireor practices that differ from those of the partner. Sexual Arousal Disorders A number of psychological factors have been cited as possible impediments to fe- male arousal. They include doubt, guilt, fear, anxiety, shame, conflict, embarrassment, tension, disgust, ir-ritation, resentment, grief, hostility toward partner,and a puritanical or moralistic upbringing. Sexualabuse has been identified as a significant risk factorfor desire and arousal disorders in women. Problems with male sexual arousal may be related to chronic stress, anxiety, or depression. Developmental fac-tors that hinder the ability to be intimate, that lead to afeeling of inadequacy or distrust, or that develop a senseof being unloving or unlovable may also result in impo-tence. Relationship factors that may affect erectile func-tioning include lack of attraction to one's partner, angertoward one's partner, or being in a relationship that isnot characterized by trust (Altman & Hanfling, 2003).Unfortunately, regardless of the etiology of the erectiledysfunction, once it occurs, the man may become in-creasingly anxious about his next sexual encounter. Thisanticipatory anxiety about achieving and maintaining anerection may then perpetuate the problem. Orgasmic Disorders Numerous psychological factors are associated with inhibited female orgasm. They in-clude fears of becoming pregnant or damage to thevagina, rejection by the sexual partner, hostility to- ward men, and feelings of guilt regarding sexual im-pulses (Sadock & Sadock, 2007).

Sexual health is an integral part of physical and emotional well-being. The nurs-ing history is incomplete if items directed toward sex-uality are not included. Most nurses are not required to obtain a sexual his- tory as in depth as the one presented in this chapter.However, for certain clients a more extensive sexualhistory is required than that which is included in thegeneral nursing history. These include clients whohave medical or surgical conditions that may affectApplication of the Nursing Process to Sexual Disorders Assessment Most assessment tools for taking a general nursing his-tory contain some questions devoted to sexuality.Many nurses feel uncomfortable obtaining informa-tion about the subject. However, accurate data mustbe collected if problems are to be identified and 4092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 620CHAPTER 30 Issues Related to Human Sexuality and Gender Dysphoria 621 their sexuality; clients with infertility problems, STDs, or complaints of sexual inadequacy; clients who arepregnant, or have gynecological problems; thoseseeking information on abortion or family planning;and individuals in premarital, marital, and psychiatriccounseling. The best approach for taking a sexual history is a nondirective one; that is, it is best to use the sexualhistory outline as a guideline but allow the interviewto progress in a less restrictive manner than the out-line permits (with one question immediately follow-ing the other). The order of the questions should beadjusted according to the client's needs as they areidentified during the interview. A nondirective ap-proach allows time for the client to interject infor-mation related to feelings or concerns about his orher sexuality.The language used should be understandable to the client. If he or she uses terminology that is unfa-miliar, ask for clarification. Take level of educationand cultural influences into consideration. The nurse's attitude must convey warmth, openness, honesty, and objectivity. Personal feelings, attitudes,and values should be clarified and should not interferewith acceptance of the client. The nurse must remainnonjudgmental. This is conveyed by listening in an in-terested matter-of-fact manner without overreacting toany information the client may present. The content outline for a sexual history presented in Box 30-1 is not intended to be used as a rigid ques-tionnaire but as a guideline from which the nurse mayselect appropriate topics for gathering informationabout the client's sexuality. The outline should be in-dividualized according to client needs. BOX 30-1 Sexual History: Content Outline I. Identifying data A. Client 1. Age 2. Gender 3. Marital status B. Parents 1. Ages 2.

Many medications can affect sexual function-ing. Evaluation of the drug and the individual'sresponse is important to ascertain whether thedrug may be contributing to the problem. Encourage the client to discuss the disease processthat may be contributing to sexual dysfunction. En-sure that the client is aware that alternative meth-ods of achieving sexual satisfaction exist and canbe learned through sex counseling if he or she andthe partner desire to do so. Provide information regarding sexuality and sexualfunctioning. Increasing knowledge and correctingmisconceptions can decrease feelings of powerless-ness and anxiety and facilitate problem resolution. Make a referral for additional counseling or sextherapy, if required. Complex problems are likelyto require assistance from an individual who is spe-cially trained to treat problems related to sexuality.Client and partner may be somewhat embarrassedto seek this kind of assistance. Support from atrusted nurse can provide the impetus for them topursue the help they need. Ineffective Sexuality Pattern Ineffective sexuality pattern is defined as \"expressions of concern regarding own sexuality\" (NANDA-I, 2012,p. 325). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goals Client will verbalize aspects about sexuality that heor she would like to change. Client and partner will communicate with eachother ways in which each believes their sexual rela-tionship could be improved. Long-Term Goals Client will express satisfaction with own sexualitypattern. Client and partner will express satisfaction with sexual relationship. Interventions Take a sexual history, noting the client's expressionof areas of dissatisfaction with his or her sexual pat-tern. Knowledge of what the client perceives as theproblem is essential for providing the type of assis-tance he or she may need. Assess areas of stress in the client's life and examinethe relationship with his or her sexual partner. Vari-ant sexual behaviors are often associated withadded stress in the client's life. The relationshipwith his or her partner may deteriorate as the Expresses desire to change variant sexual behavior Participates and cooperates with extended plan ofbehavior modification Expresses satisfaction with own sexuality pattern Planning/Implementation Following are nursing diagnoses commonly used withindividuals experiencing alterations in sexual func-tioning. Short- and long-term goals and nursing in-terventions are presented for each. Sexual Dysfunction Sexual dysfunction is defined as \"the state in which an individual experiences a change in sexual functionduring the sexual response phases of desire, excita-tion, and/or orgasm, which is viewed as unsatisfying,unrewarding, or inadequate\" (NANDA International[NANDA-I], 2012, p. 323). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goals Client will identify stressors that may contribute toloss of sexual function within 1 week OR Client will discuss pathophysiology of diseaseprocess that contributes to sexual dysfunctionwithin 1 week. (For the client with permanent dysfunction due to disease process): Client will verbalize willingness to seek pro-fessional assistance from a sex therapist in order tolearn alternative ways of achieving sexual satisfactionwith partner by (time is individually determined). Long-Term Goal Client will resume sexual activity at a level satisfactoryto self and partner by (time is individually determined). Interventions Assess the client's sexual history and previous levelof satisfaction in his or her sexual relationship. Thishistory establishes a database from which to workand provides a foundation for goal setting. Assess the client's perception of the problem. Theclient's idea of what constitutes a problem may dif-fer from that of the nurse. It is the client's percep-tion on which the goals of care must be established. Help the client determine the timeline associatedwith the onset of the problem, and discuss what washappening in his or her life situation at that time.Stress in all areas of life will affect sexual function-ing. The client may be unaware of the correlationbetween stress and sexual dysfunction. Assess the client's mood and level of energy. De-pression and fatigue decrease desire and enthusi-asm for participation in sexual activity.4092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 624CHAPTER 30 Issues Related to Human Sexuality and Gender Dysphoria 625 individual eventually gains sexual satisfaction only from variant practices. Note cultural, social, ethnic, racial, and religiousfactors that may contribute to conflicts regardingvariant sexual practices. The client may be unawareof the influence these factors exert in creating feel-ings of discomfort, shame, and guilt regarding sex-ual attitudes and behavior. Be accepting and nonjudgmental. Sexuality is avery personal and sensitive subject. The client ismore likely to share this information if he or shedoes not fear being judged by the nurse. Assist the therapist in a plan of behavior modifica-tion to help the client who desires to decrease vari-ant sexual behaviors. Individuals with paraphilicdisorders are treated by specialists who have experi-ence in modifying variant sexual behaviors. Nursescan intervene by providing assistance with imple-mentation of the plan for behavior modification. If altered sexuality patterns are related to illness ormedical treatment, provide information to theclient and partner regarding the correlation be-tween the illness and the sexual alteration. Explainpossible modifications in usual sexual patterns thatthe client and partner may try in an effort toachieve a satisfying sexual experience in spite of thelimitation. The client and his or her partner may beunaware of alternate possibilities for achieving sex-ual satisfaction, or anxiety associated with the limi-tation may interfere with rational problem solving. Teach the client that sexuality is a normal humanresponse and is not synonymous with any one sex-ual act; that it reflects the totality of the person anddoes not relate exclusively to the sex organs or sex-ual behavior. The client must understand that sex- ualfeelings are human feelings. If the client feels abnormal or very unlike everyoneelse, the self-concept is likely to be very low\u2014evenworthless. Helping him or her to understand thateven though the behavior is variant, feelings andmotivations are common, may help to increase feel-ings of self-worth and desire to change behavior. Concept Care Mapping The concept map care plan is an innovative approach toplanning and organizing nursing care (see Chapter 9).It is a diagrammatic teaching and learning strategythat allows visualization of interrelationships betweenmedical diagnoses, nursing diagnoses, assessmentdata, and treatments. An example of a concept mapcare plan for a client with a sexual disorder is pre-sented in Figure 30-3. Client/Family Education The role of client teacher is important in the psychi-atric area, as it is in all areas of nursing. A list of topicsfor client/family education relevant to sexual disor-ders is presented in Box 30-2. Evaluation Reassessment is necessary to determine if selected in-terventions have been successful in helping the clientovercome problems with sexual functioning. Evalua-tion may be facilitated by gathering information usingthe following types of questions. For the Client With Sexual Dysfunction: Has the client identified life situations that promotefeelings of depression and decreased sexual desire? Can he or she verbalize ways to deal with this stress? Can the client satisfactorily communicate with sex-ual partner about the problem? Have the client and sexual partner identified waysto enhance sexual desire and the achievement ofsexual satisfaction for both? Are client and partner seeking assistance with rela-tionship conflict? Do both partners agree on what the major problemis? Do they have the motivation to attempt change? Do client and partner verbalize an increase in sex-ual satisfaction? For the Client With Variant Sexual Behaviors: Can the client correlate an increase in variant sex-ual behavior to times of severe stress? Has the client been able to identify those stressfulsituations and verbalize alternative ways to dealwith them? Does the client express a desire to change variantsexual behavior and a willingness to cooperate withextended therapy to do so? Does the client express an understanding aboutthe normalcy of sexual feelings, aside from the in-appropriateness of his or her behavior? Are expressions of increased self-worth evident? Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) The Institute of Medicine (IOM), in its 2003 report, Health Professions Education: A Bridge to Quality , chal- lenged faculties of medicine, nursing, and other healthprofessions to ensure that their graduates have achieveda core set of competencies in order to meet the needsof the 21st-century health-care system. These compe-tencies include providing patient-centered care, working ininterdisciplinary teams, employing evidence-based practice, applying quality improvement, ensuring safety, andutilizing informatics. A QSEN teaching strategy is included in Box 30-3. The use of this type of activity is intended to armthe instructor and the student with guidelines for attainingthe knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for achieve-ment of quality and safety competencies in nursing.4092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 625626 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation FIGURE 30-3 Concept map care plan for clients with sexual disorders.Clinical Vignette: Harry (age 60) and Sally (age 58) have been married 35 years.

The masculinizing side effects makethis approach unacceptable to women, and the evi-dence that it increases libido in men is inconclusive.Becker and Stinson (2008) describe the most effec-tive treatment as a combination of cognitive therapyto deal with maladaptive beliefs; behavioral treat-ment, such as exercises to enhance sexual pleasur-ing and communication; and relationship therapyto deal with the individual's use of sex as a methodof control. Low sexual desire is often the result of partner incompatibility. If this is the case, the therapistmay choose to shift from the sexual issue to help-ing a couple identify and deal with their incom-patibility. Sexual Arousal Disorders Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder The goal of treatment for female sexual interest/arousal disorder is to reduce the anxiety associatedwith sexual activity. Masters and Johnson (1970) reported successful results using their behaviorallyoriented sensate focus exercises to treat this disorder.

Psychodynamic interventions may help alleviate intrapsychic conflicts contributing to per-formance anxiety (Becker & Stinson, 2008). Various medications, including testosterone and yohimbine, have been used to treat erectile disorder.Penile injections of papaverine or prostaglandin havebeen used to produce an erection lasting from 1 to 4hours. However, this treatment is unacceptable tomany men because of pain of the injection and sideeffects, such as priapism and fibrotic nodules in thepenis (Becker & Stinson, 2008). Several other medications have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of erectile disorder. enzyme that breaks down cyclicguanosine monophosphate (cGMP), compoundthat is required to produce an erection. This actiononly occurs, however, in the presence of nitric oxide(NO), which is released during sexual arousal. PDE5inhibitors do not result in sexual arousal. They workto achieve penile erection in the presence of sexualarousal. Adverse effects include headache, facialflushing, indigestion, nasal congestion, dizziness, andvisual changes (mild color tinges and blurred vision)(Vallerand & Sanoski, 2013). In 2005, the FDA or-dered that the manufacturers of these medicationsadd a warning to their labels. This action was takenperformance pressures and anxiety associated withpossible failure. Altman and Hanfling (2003) state: The cornerstone of sex therapy is a series of behav- ioral exercises called sensate focus exercises. Thesehighly structured touching activities are designed tohelp overcome performance anxiety and increasecomfort with physical intimacy. Initially, the coupleagrees to refrain from intercourse or genital stimula-tion until the later stages of treatment. This helps dis-pel anxiety that's built up around sexual performanceand allows establishment of new patterns of relating.(pp. 38-39) The couple is instructed to take turns caressing each other's bodies. Initially, they are to avoid touch- ing breasts and genitals, and to focus on the sensationsof being touched. The caressing progresses to includetouching of the breasts and genitals, to touching eachother simultaneously, and eventually to include inter-course. These non-goal-oriented exercises promotethe sensual side of sexual interaction in a nonpres-sured, nonevaluative way (Masters et al., 1995). Erectile Disorder Sensate focus has also been used effectively for erec-tile disorder in men. Clinicians widely agree that evenwhen significant organic factors have been identified,psychological factors may also be present and must beconsidered in treatment. Group therapy, hypnotherapy, and systematic de- sensitization have also been used successfully in BOX 30-3 QSEN TEACHING STRATEGY\u2014cont'd \u0081Part II.

It is not possible to ascertainwhether the medications are responsible for nonar-teritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a condi-tion in which blood flow to the optic nerve is blocked.More recently, the FDA has issued an additional warn-ing associated with PDE5 inhibitors of risk of suddenhearing loss (Kim & Brosman, 2013). PDE5 inhibitorsare contraindicated in concurrent use with nitrates. Two other oral medications, apomorphine and phentolamine, are currently being investigated foruse with erectile disorder. Phentolamine has beenused in combination with papaverine in an injectableform that increases blood flow to the penis, resultingin an erection. Apomorphine acts directly on thedopamine receptors in the brain. This mode of stim-ulating dopamine in the brain is thought to enhancethe sexual response. For erectile disorder refractory to other treatment methods, penile prostheses may be implanted. Twobasic types are currently available: a bendable sili-cone implant and an inflatable device. The bendablevariety requires a relatively simple surgical techniquefor insertion of silicone rods into the erectile areasof the penis. This results in a perpetual state of semi-erection for the client. The inflatable penile prosthe-sis produces an erection only when it is desired, andthe appearance of the penis in both the flaccid anderect states is completely normal. Potential candi-dates for penile implantation should undergo carefulpsychological and physical screening. Although pe-nile implants do not enable the client to recover theability to ejaculate or to have an orgasm, men withprosthetic devices have generally reported satisfac-tion with their subsequent sexual functioning. Orgasmic Disorders Female Orgasmic Disorder Because anxiety may contribute to the lack of orgas-mic ability in women, sensate focus is often advised toreduce anxiety, increase awareness of physical sensa-tions, and transfer communication skills from the ver-bal to the nonverbal domain. Phillips (2000) providesthe following description of therapy for the anorgas-mic woman: Treatment relies on maximizing stimulation and min- imizing inhibition. Stimulation may include mastur-bation with prolonged stimulation (initially up to onehour) and/or the use of a vibrator as needed, andmuscular control of sexual tension (alternating con-traction and relaxation of the pelvic muscles duringhigh sexual arousal). The latter is similar to Kegal ex-ercises. Methods to minimize inhibition include dis-traction by \"spectatoring\" (observing oneself from athird-party perspective), fantasizing, or listening tomusic (p. 135).Treatment for secondary anorgasmia (in which the client has had orgasms in the past, but is now unable to achieve them) focuses on the couple and their re-lationship. Therapy with both partners is essential tothe success of this disorder. Delayed Ejaculation Treatment for delayed ejaculation is very similar tothat described for the anorgasmic woman. A combi-nation of sensate focus and masturbatory traininghas been used with a high degree of success in theMasters and Johnson clinic. Treatment for male or-gasmic disorder almost always includes the sexualpartner. Premature (Early) Ejaculation Masters and associates (1995) advocate what theysuggest is a highly successful technique for thetreatment of premature ejaculation. Sensate focusis used, with progression to genital stimulation.When the man reaches the point of imminent ejac-ulation, his sexual partner is instructed to apply the\"squeeze\" technique: applying pressure at the baseof the glans penis, using the thumb and first two fin-gers. Pressure is held for about 4 seconds and thenreleased. This technique is continued until the manis no longer on the verge of ejaculating. This tech-nique is practiced during subsequent periods of sexual stimulation. No medication has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of premature ejaculation, but a num-ber of studies have shown efficacy for this disorderwith the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs) (Benson, Ost, Noble, & Lakin, 2013). Someindividuals may achieve positive results with singledosing prior to sexual relations, while others may re-quire regular daily dosing to achieve an adequateblood level. Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder Treatment for the pain of intercourse begins with athorough physical and gynecological examination.When organic pathology has been eliminated, theclient's fears and anxieties underlying sexual func-tioning are investigated (Becker & Stinson, 2008). Sys-tematic desensitization has been used successfully todecrease fears and anxieties associated with painfulintercourse. Treatment of penetration disorder begins with ed- ucation of the woman and her sexual partner regard-ing the anatomy and physiology of the disorder (i.e.,what exactly is occurring during the vaginal reflexand possible etiologies). The involuntary nature ofthe disorder is stressed in an effort to alleviate the sex-ual partner's perception that this occurrence is an actof willful withholding by the woman.CHAPTER 30 Issues Related to Human Sexuality and Gender Dysphoria 6294092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 629630 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation (gender identity disorder), and to emphasize the emo- tional component associated with the condition. Course and Epidemiology The prevalence of gender dysphoria is estimated at 1in 30,000 men and 1 in 100,000 women (Black & Andreasen, 2011). Most (approximately 75 percent)are biological males desiring reassignment to femalegender (MTF), and the remaining 25 percent are females desiring to be male (FTM) (Martin, 2007).Some individuals with gender dysphoria choose tofind ways of living with their cross-gender identitywithout altering their bodies. Others have a strong de-sire to change their physical body to reflect their coregender identity. It has been noted that gender dys-phoria sometimes dissipates after early childhood;however, if it persists into adolescence, it appears tobe irreversible (Dreger, 2009). King (2011) states: A recent study found that about 3 percent of 7-year- old boys and about 5 percent of girls showed cross-gender behavior. However, in a 10-year follow-upstudy, most were no longer displaying cross-genderbehavior; this was true only in the most extremecases. (p. 205) Predisposing Factors Biological Influences Becker and Johnson (2008) report that studies of fe- males with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) asa result of high levels of prenatal androgens suggestthat there may be a relation between CAH and gen-der dysphoria. The data are still inconclusive, and fur-ther research in this area is indicated. Several studies have been conducted to determine if sex hormone levels are abnormal in individuals withgender dysphoria. In some studies, decreased levels oftestosterone were found in male transgendered individ-uals, and abnormally high levels of testosterone werefound in female transgendered individuals, but the re-sults have been inconsistent (Becker & Johnson, 2008).One large-scale study of cross-gender behavior in twinsrevealed that the similarity for cross-gender behaviorwas greater in monozygotic (identical) than in dizygotic(nonidentical) twin pairs, suggesting a possible geneticlink (Beijsterveldt, Hudziak, & Boomsma, 2006). Another study reported on possible effects of testosterone on brain differentiation (Zhou, Horman,Gooren, & Swaab, 1995). The researchers found thatthe red nucleus of the stria terminalis (a region of thehypothalamus) in male-to-female transsexuals corre-sponded to that of typical females, rather than that oftypical males. This was the case whether the individualwas heterosexual or homosexual, and was not ac-counted for by hormone therapy.Gender identity is the sense of knowing whether oneis male or female\u2014that is, the awareness of one's mas-culinity or femininity. Gender dysphoria occurs whenthere and one's DSM-5 diagnosis the ac- cording to the client's current age: gender dysphoriain children and gender dysphoria in adolescents oradults. Although most cases of the condition begin inchildhood, persons who present clinically with genderdysphoria may be of any age. For purposes of this text, differentiation between the age groups will be discussed, but the major focuswill be on the condition as it emerges in childhood.Nurses who work in areas of primary prevention withchildren can have the greatest effect in terms of treat-ing this condition. Treatment aimed at reversal in be-havior, if it is desired by the client, is consideredcautiously optimistic if initiated in childhood. After es-tablishment of a core gender identity, it is difficult laterin life to instill attributes of an opposite identity, andmost commonly, it is not desired by the individual. There was much controversy in the psychiatric com- munity about whether gender dysphoria should be in-cluded in the DSM-5. The transgender community expressed a great deal of concern, protesting to thepsychiatric work group that, \"different is not a disease.\"The work group attempted to address some of the con-cerns of the transgender community, taking into con-sideration the stigma associated with inclusion of thediagnosis, but also the need for inclusion in terms ofaccess to adequate treatment and care. If the diagnosiswas not included, those who chose to seek medical-sur-gical treatment may be denied third-party assistance.The term gender dysphoria was adopted to minimize the stigma that was connected to the previous label CORE CONCEPT Gender The condition of being either male or female. The second phase of treatment involves systematic desensitization. The client is taught a series of tensing and relaxing exercises aimed at relaxation of thepelvic musculature. Relaxation of the pelvic musclesis followed by a procedure involving the systematic in-sertion of dilators of graduated sizes until the womanis able to accept the penis into the vagina without dis-comfort. This physical therapy, combined with treat-ment of any identified relationship problems, hasbeen used by the Masters and Johnson clinic with con-siderable success (Masters et al., 1995). Gender Dysphoria4092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 630CHAPTER 30 Issues Related to Human Sexuality and Gender Dysphoria 631 Family Dynamics It appears that family dynamics may play an influen- tial role in the etiology of gender dysphoria. Sadockand Sadock (2007) state, \"Children usually develop agender identity consonant with their sex of rearing(also known as assigned sex )\" (p. 718). Gender roles are culturally determined, and parents encouragemasculine or feminine behaviors in their children. Al-though \"temperament\" may play a role with certainbehavioral characteristics being present at birth,mothers usually foster a child's pride in their gender.Sadock and Sadock (2007) state: The father's role is also important in the early years, and his presence normally helps the separation-individuation process. Without a father, mother andchild may remain overly close. For a girl, the father isnormally the prototype of future love objects; for a boy,the father is a model for male identification.\" (p. 719) In a 2003 study, Zucker and associates found a high rate of psychopathology and family dysfunction in children with gender dysphoria. Maternal depressionand bipolar disorder were frequently demonstrated,whereas fathers often exhibited depression and sub-stance use disorders. The authors recommended thatparental conflicts and psychopathology must be givencareful consideration as an aspect in childhood gen-der dysphoria. Psychoanalytic Theory The psychoanalytic theory suggests that gender identity problems begin during the struggle of theOedipal/Electra conflict. Problems may reflect bothreal family events and those created in the child'simagination. These conflicts, whether real or imag-ined, interfere with the child's loving of the opposite-gender parent and identifying with the same-genderparent, and ultimately with normal gender identity. Application of the Nursing Process to Gender Dysphoria in Children Background Assessment Data (Symptomatology) Some children may resist wearing the clothing or playing with the toys that are typical for their assignedgender. This is often part of normal childhood behav-ior. But when these behaviors persist into later child-hood and adolescence, they may progress intosymptoms of gender dysphoria. Some of these symp-toms include the following: the insistence of being ofthe opposite gender, disgust with one's own genitals,belief that one will grow up to become the oppositegender, refusal to wear clothing of the assigned gender, desirous of having the genitals of the oppositegender, and refusal to participate in the games andactivities culturally associated with the assigned gen-der. These children may be subjected to teasing andrejection by their peers and disapproval from familymembers. This occurs early in childhood for boys, butoften does not occur before adolescence in girls, be-cause masculine behavior in girls is more culturallyacceptable than feminine behavior in boys. Becauseof this rejection, interpersonal relationships are ham-pered. The condition is not common but occurs morefrequently in boys than in girls. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria in children are pre-sented in Box 30-4. BOX 30-4 Diagnostic Criteria for Gender Dysphoria in Children A. A marked incongruence between one's experienced/ expressed gender and assigned gender, of at least 6 months' duration, as manifested by at least six of the fol-lowing indicators (one of which must be Criterion A1):1. A strong desire to be of the other gender or an insis- tence that he or she is the other gender (or some al-ternative gender different from one's assignedgender). 2. In boys (assigned gender), a strong preference for cross-dressing or simulating female attire; in girls (assigned gender), a strong preference for wearingonly typical masculine clothing and a strong resistanceto the wearing of typical feminine clothing. 3. A strong preference for cross-gender roles in make- believe or fantasy play. 4. A strong preference for the toys, games, or activities stereotypically used or engaged in by the other gender. 5. A strong preference for playmates of the other gender. 6. In boys (assigned gender), a strong rejection of typi- cally masculine toys, games, and activities and astrong avoidance of rough-and-tumble play; or in girls(assigned gender), a strong rejection of typically fem-inine toys, games, and activities. 7. A strong dislike of one's sexual anatomy.8. A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics that match one's experienced gender. B. The condition is associated with clinically significant dis- tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other im-portant areas of functioning.

The client: Demonstrates trust in a therapist of the same gender Demonstrates development of a close relationshipwith the parent of the same gender Demonstrates a diminishment in the excessivelyclose relationship with the parent of the oppositegender Demonstrates behaviors that are culturally appro-priate for assigned gender Verbalizes and demonstrates comfort in, and satis-faction with, assigned gender role Interacts appropriately with others demonstratingculturally acceptable behaviors Verbalizes and demonstrates self-satisfaction withassigned gender role Planning/Implementation Following are nursing diagnoses commonly used withindividuals experiencing gender dysphoria. Short-and long-term goals and nursing interventions arepresented for each. Disturbed Personal Identity Disturbed personal identity is defined as the \"inability tomaintain an integrated and complete perception ofself\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 282). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goals Client will verbalize knowledge of behaviors thatare appropriate and culturally acceptable for as-signed gender. Client will verbalize desire for congruence betweenpersonal feelings and behavior and assigned gender. Long-Term Goals Client will demonstrate behaviors that are appropri-ate and culturally acceptable for assigned gender.Client will express personal satisfaction and feel-ings of being comfortable in assigned gender. Interventions Spend time with the client and show positive re-gard. Trust and unconditional acceptance are es-sential to the establishment of a therapeuticnurse-client relationship. Be aware of personal feelings and attitudes towardthis client and his or her behavior. Attitudes influ-ence behavior. The nurse must not allow negativeattitudes to interfere with the effectiveness of inter-ventions. Allow the client to describe his or her perceptionof the problem. It is important to know how theclient perceives the problem before attempting tocorrect misperceptions. Discuss with the client the types of behaviorsthat are more culturally acceptable. Practicethese behaviors through role-playing or withplay therapy strategies (e.g., male and femaledolls). Positive reinforcement or social attentionmay be given for use of appropriate behaviors.No response is given for stereotypical opposite-gender behaviors. CLINICAL PEARL The objective in working for behavioral change in a child who has gender dysphoria is to enhance culturally ap-propriate same-gender behaviors, but not necessarily to extin- guish all coexisting opposite-gender behaviors. Behavioral change is attempted with the child's best interests in mind. That is, to help him or herwith cultural and societal integration, while main-taining individuality. To preserve self-esteem andenhance self-worth, the child must know that he orshe is accepted unconditionally as a unique andworthwhile individual. Impaired Social Interaction Impaired social interaction is defined as \"insufficient or excessive quantity or ineffective quality of social ex-change\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 320). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal Client will verbalize possible reasons for ineffectiveinteractions with others. Long-Term Goal Client will interact with others using culturally ac-ceptable behaviors.632 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 632Interventions Once the client feels comfortable with the new be- haviors in role playing or one-to-one nurse-client in-teractions, the new behaviors may be tried in groupsituations. If possible, remain with the client duringinitial interactions with others. The presence of atrusted individual provides security for the client ina new situation, and also provides the potential forfeedback to the client about his or her behavior. Observe client behaviors and the responses he orshe elicits from others. Give social attention (e.g.,smile, nod) to desired behaviors. Follow up these\"practice\" sessions with one-to-one processing ofthe interaction. Give positive reinforcement for ef-forts. Positive reinforcement encourages repetitionof desirable behaviors. One-to-one processing pro-vides time for discussing the appropriateness ofspecific behaviors and why they should or shouldnot be repeated. Offer support if client is feeling hurt from peerridicule. Matter-of-factly discuss the behaviors thatelicited the ridicule. Offer no personal reaction tothe behavior. Personal reaction from the nursewould be considered judgmental. Validation ofclient's feelings is important, yet it is also importantthat client understand why his or her behavior wasthe subject of ridicule and how to avoid it in the future. The goal is to create a trusting, nonthreatening at-mosphere for the client in an attempt to changebehavior and improve social interactions. Long-term studies have not yet revealed the significanceof therapy with these children for psychosexual re-lationship development in adolescence or adult-hood. One variable that must be considered is theevidence of psychopathology within the families ofmany of these children. Low Self-Esteem Low self-esteem is defined \"negative self-evaluating/feelings about self or self-capabilities\" (NANDA-I,2012, pp. 285-287). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal Client will verbalize positive statements about self,including past accomplishments and futureprospects. Long-Term Goal Client will verbalize and demonstrate behaviorsthat indicate self-satisfaction with assigned gender,ability to interact with others, and a sense of self asa worthwhile person. Interventions In an effort to enhance the child's self-esteem, en-courage him or her to engage in activities in whichhe or she is likely to achieve success. Help the child to focus on aspects of his or her lifefor which positive feelings exist. Discourage rumi-nation about situations that are perceived as fail-ures or over which the client has no control. Givepositive feedback for these behaviors. Help the client identify behaviors or aspects oflife he or she would like to change. If realistic,assist the child in problem-solving ways to bringabout the change. Having some control over hisor her life may decrease feelings of powerless-ness and increase feelings of self-worth and self-satisfaction. Offer to be available for support to the child whenhe or she is feeling rejected by peers. Having anavailable support person who does not judge thechild's behavior and who provides unconditionalacceptance assists the child to progress toward ac-ceptance of self as a worthwhile person. Evaluation The final step of the nursing process is to determineif the nursing interventions have been effective inachieving the intended outcomes. This evaluationprocess requires that the nurse reassess the client'sbehaviors and determine if the changes at which theinterventions had been directed have occurred. Forthe child with gender dysphoria, this may be accom-plished by using the following types of questions: Does the client perceive that a problem existed thatrequires a change in behavior for resolution? Does the client demonstrate use of behaviors that areculturally accepted for his or her assigned gender? Can the client use these culturally accepted behav-iors in interactions with others? Is the client accepted by peers when same-genderbehaviors are used? If the client is refusing to change behaviors, whatis the peer reaction? What is the client's response to negative peer reaction? Can the client verbalize positive statements aboutself? Can the client discuss past accomplishments with-out dwelling on the perceived failures? Has the client shown progress toward accepting selfas a worthwhile person regardless of others' re-sponses to his or her behavior?CHAPTER 30 Issues Related to Human Sexuality and Gender Dysphoria 6334092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 633Treatment Issues Becker and (2008) stated: Treatment [of gender dysphoria in the child] has three goals: increasing peer support and acceptance,treating co-occurring mental health concerns, and re-ducing the likelihood of [gender dysphoria] in adult-hood. (p. 737) Treatment of children with gender dysphoria may be initiated when the behaviors cause significant distressand when the client desires it. Several controversialissues exist relative to treatment of these children.One type of treatment suggests that they should beencouraged to become satisfied with their assignedgender. Behavior modification therapy serves to helpthe child embrace the games and activities of his orher assigned gender and promotes development offriendships with same gender peers. A somewhat ef-feminate boy will not be forced to become an aggres-sive and competitive type, nor will a \"tomboy\" beexpected to turn into a \"girly-girl.\" The goal is accept-ance of a culturally appropriate self-image withoutmental health concerns from discomfort associatedwith the assigned gender. Another treatment model suggests that children who have problems with gender identity are dys-phoric only because of their image within the cul-ture. In this view, children should be accepted asthey see themselves\u2014different from their assignedgender\u2014and supported in their efforts to live as thegender in which they feel most comfortable. Someprofessionals are recommending pubertal delay foradolescents aged 12 to 16 years who have sufferedwith extreme lifelong gender dysphoria, and whohave supportive parents that encourage the child topursue a desired change in gender (Gibson &Catlin, 2010). A gonadotropin-releasing hormoneagonist is administered, which suppresses pubertalchanges. The treatment is reversible if the adoles-cent decides later not to pursue the gender change.When the medication is withdrawn, external sexualdevelopment proceeds, and the individual hasavoided permanent surgical intervention. If he orshe decides as an adult to advance to the surgical in-tervention, the proponents of the hormonal treat-ment suggest that initiating pubertal delay at anearly age will \"most certainly result in high percent-ages of individuals who will more easily pass into theopposite gender role than when treatment com-menced well after the development of secondarysexual characteristics\" (Delemarre-van de Waal &Cohen-Kettenis, 2006). The type of treatment one chooses for gender dys- phoria (if any) is very individual and a matter of per-sonal choice. However, issues associated with mentalhealth concerns, such as depression, anxiety, socialisolation, anger, self-esteem, and parental conflict,must be addressed, even if the client elects not to pro-ceed with the behavior modification approach.Cohen-Kettenis and Pf\u00e4fflin (2003) reported that, intheir clinic population, when the functional mentalhealth problems within the family were resolved, thegender dysphoria often dissipated. Behavior therapy of children with gender dyspho- ria typically occurs in outpatient clinics. Nurses work-ing in these settings may encounter these clients fromtime to time, although the condition is not common.One-to-one nursing intervention may be provided byan advanced practice psychiatric clinical nurse spe-cialist or nurse practitioner. Gender Dysphoria in Adolescents or Adults With this condition, an individual, despite havingthe anatomical characteristics of a given gender, hasthe self-perception of being of the opposite gender.Individuals with this disorder do not feel comfort-able wearing the clothes of their assigned genderand often engage in cross-dressing. They may findtheir own genitals repugnant and may repeatedlysubmit requests to the health-care system for hor-monal and surgical gender reassignment. Depres-sion and anxiety are common and are oftenattributed by the individual to his or her inability tolive in the desired gender role. (Refer to the previ-ous section on gender dysphoria in children for pre-disposing factors to this condition.) Treatment Issues Intervention with adolescents and adults with gen-der dysphoria is difficult. Adolescents rarely have thedesire or motivation to alter their cross-gender roles,and disruptive behaviors are not uncommon. Someadults seek therapy to learn how to cope with theiraltered sexual identity, while others have direct andimmediate request for hormonal therapy and surgi-cal sex reassignment. Treatment of the adult withgender dysphoria is a complex process. The truetransgendered individual intensely desires to havethe genitalia and physical appearance of the as-signed gender changed to conform to his or hergender identity. This change requires a great dealmore than surgical alteration of physical features. Inmost cases, the individual must undergo extensivepsychological testing and counseling, as well as livein the role of the desired gender for up to 2 yearsbefore surgery. Hormonal treatment is initiated during this pe- riod. Male clients receive estrogen, which results ina redistribution of body fat in a more \"feminine\"634 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 634pattern, enlargement of the breasts, a softening of the skin, and reduction in body hair. Women re-ceive testosterone, which also causes a redistribu-tion of body fat, growth of facial and body hair,enlargement of the clitoris, and deepening of thevoice (Becker & Johnson, 2008). Amenorrhea oc-curs within a few months. Surgical treatment for male-to-female transgender reassignment involves removal of the penis and testesand creation of an artificial vagina. Care is taken topreserve sensory nerves in the area so that the indi-vidual may continue to experience sexual stimulation. Surgical treatment for female-to-male transgender reassignment is more complex. A mastectomy andsometimes a hysterectomy are performed. A penisand scrotum are constructed from tissues in the gen-ital and abdominal area, and the vaginal orifice isclosed. A penile implant is used to attain erection. Both men and women continue to receive mainte- nance hormone therapy following surgery. Satisfac-tion with the results is highest among clients who areemotionally healthy, have adequate social support,and attain reasonable cosmetic results (Martin, 2007).Black and Andreasen (2011) state, \"Many patients willcontinue to benefit from psychotherapy following sur-gery to assist them in adjusting to their new genderrole\" (p. 340). Nursing care of the post-gender-reassignment sur- gical client is similar to that of most other postsurgicalclients. Particular attention is given to maintainingcomfort, preventing infection, preserving integrity ofthe surgical site, maintaining elimination, and meet-ing nutritional needs. Psychosocial needs may have todo with body image, fears and insecurities about relating to others, and being accepted in the new gender role. Meeting these needs can begin withnursing in a nonthreatening, nonjudgmental healingatmosphere. Variations in Sexual Orientation Homosexuality Homosexual activity occurs under some circum-stances in probably all known human cultures and allmammalian species for which it has been studied.The term homosexuality is derived from the Greek root homo meaning \"same,\" and refers to sexual pref- erence for individuals of the same gender. It may beapplied in a general way to homosexuals of both gen-ders but is often used to specifically denote male ho-mosexuality. The term lesbianism , used to identify female homosexuality, is traced to the Greek poetSappho who lived on the island of Lesbos and is fa-mous for the love poems she wrote to other women.Most homosexuals prefer the term \"gay\" because itis less derogatory in its lack of emphasis on the sexualaspects of the orientation. A heterosexual is referredto as \"straight.\" Beginning in the late 1800s, homosexuality was classified as a mental illness. This remained the caseuntil 1973 when the American Psychiatric Associationremoved the classification from the DSM. Homosex- uality remained as a mental disorder in the WorldHealth Organization's International Classification of Dis-eases until 1992. At one time, nearly all states had sodomy laws that forbade any sexual behavior thatcould not result in reproduction. In 2003, when theselaws still remained in 13 states, the U.S. SupremeCourt issued a broad-scoped decision that essentiallyinvalided all sodomy laws (King, 2011). Attitudeschange slowly, but they are changing. In 1977, Americans were closely divided in their belief on the morality of homosexuality. At that time,43 percent considered homosexual relations morallyacceptable, and 43 percent stated they believed themto be morally wrong. A recent Gallup poll shows thatthe attitude toward homosexuality has taken a posi-tive turn, with 63 percent indicating moral acceptabil-ity and only 31 percent believing it to be morallywrong (Gallup, 2012). Some experts believe thatmany Americans' attitudes toward homosexuals canbest be described as homophobic. Homophobia is de- fined as a negative attitude toward or fear of homo-sexuality or homosexuals. It may be indicative of adeep-seated insecurity about one's own gender iden-tity. Homophobic behaviors include extreme preju-dice against, abhorrence of, and discomfort aroundhomosexuals. These behaviors are usually rational-ized by religious, moral, or legal considerations. Relationship patterns are as varied among homo- sexuals as they are among heterosexuals. Some ho-mosexuals may remain with one partner for anextended period of time, even for a lifetime, whereasothers prefer not to make a commitment, and \"playthe field\" instead. No one knows for sure why people become homo- sexual or heterosexual. Various theories have beenproposed regarding the issue, but no single etiologi-cal factor has consistently emerged. Many contribut-ing factors likely influence the development of sexualorientation. Predisposing Factors Biological Theories A study by Bailey and Pillard (1991) revealed a 52 per-cent concordance for homosexual orientation inmonozygotic twins and 22 percent in dizygotic twins.Other studies have produced similar results (Kendler,Thornton, Gilman, & Kessler, 2000; Whitam, Diamond,& Martin, 1993). These data were significant to suggestCHAPTER 30 Issues Related to Human Sexuality and Gender Dysphoria 6354092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 635636 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation the possibility of a heritable trait. Sadock and Sadock (2007) state: Gay men show a familial distribution; they have more brothers who are gay than do heterosexual men. Onestudy found that 33 out of 40 pairs of gay brothersshared a genetic marker on the bottom half of the Xchromosome. (p. 686) A number of studies have been conducted to deter- mine whether or not there is a hormonal influence in the etiology of homosexuality. It has been hypothe-sized that levels of testosterone may be lower and levelsof estrogen higher in homosexual men than in het-erosexual men. Results have been inconsistent. It hasalso been suggested that exposure to inappropriatelevels of androgens during the critical fetal period ofsexual differentiation may contribute to homosexualorientation. This hypothesis lacks definitive evidence,and conclusions regarding its validity remain tentative. Psychosocial Theories Freud (1930) believed that all humans are inherentlybisexual, with the capacity for both heterosexual andhomosexual behavior. He theorized that all individu-als go through a homoerotic phase as children. Thus,if homosexuality occurs later in life, it is due to arrestof normal psychosexual development. He also be-lieved homosexuality could occur as a result of patho-logical family relationships in which the child adoptsa negative Oedipal position; that is, there is sexualizedattachment to the parent of the same gender andidentification with the parent of the opposite gender. Some theories suggest that a dysfunctional family pat- tern may have an etiological influence in the develop-ment of homosexuality. These \"nurture\" theories focuson the parent-child relationship, and most specifically,the relationship with the same-gender parent. They sug-gest that gay men often have a dominant, supportivemother and a weak, remote, or hostile father. Lesbiansmay have had a dysfunctional mother-daughter relation-ship. Both subsequently try to meet their unmet same-gender needs through sexual relationships. These theories of family dynamics have been dis- puted by some clinicians who believe that parentshave very little influence on the outcome of their chil-dren's sexual-partner orientation. Others suggestthere may not be one single answer\u2014that sexual ori-entation may result from a complex interaction be-tween biological and psychosocial factors, shaping theindividual at an early age. Special Concerns People with homosexual preferences have problemsthat are similar to those of their heterosexual counter-parts. Considerations of attractiveness, finding a partner, and concerns about sexual adequacy are common to both. STDs are epidemic among sexually active individuals of all sexual orientations. Of partic-ular concern is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome(AIDS), which was considered a \"gay disease\" for thefirst few years of the epidemic. AIDS is a viral illnessthat, initially in the Western world, was indeed largelytransmitted by male homosexual activity. AlthoughAIDS is now known to spread through contaminatedblood products, the sharing of needles by intravenousdrug users, and heterosexual contact, some individu-als still believe AIDS is God's way of punishing homo-sexuals. These societal attitudes are considered bymany homosexuals to be their greatest burden. Some homosexuals live in fear of the discovery of their sexual orientation; they fear being rejected by par-ents and significant others. They experience a great dealof cognitive dissonance related to the disparity betweentheir overt behavior and their inner feelings. Social sanc-tions still exist in some areas for homosexuals in regardto employment, housing, and public accommodations.The Human Rights Commission protects homosexuals;however, discrimination is still widespread. Another area of concern to the gay community is the issue of same-sex marriage. In the United States,same-sex marriage is legal in Connecticut, Iowa, NewHampshire, Washington, Maryland, Massachusetts, Vermont, New York, New Jersey, New Mexico, Maine,Delaware, Minnesota, Rhode Island, California, Hawaii,Illinois, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington, DC.Same-sex marriage is also legal in Canada, Spain, theNetherlands, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Argentina, Iceland, Portugal, Denmark, Brazil, France, NewZealand, and South Africa. Other U.S. states (e.g.,Colorado, Nevada, and Wisconsin) and countries(e.g., Ecuador, Ireland, Mexico, Denmark, Germany,Austria, Luxembourg, Hungary, Switzerland, andUnited Kingdom) now recognize \"civil unions\" or\"domestic partnerships,\" which allow same-sex cou-ples various financial, insurance, and family benefitsusually restricted to married heterosexual couples. Opponents of same-sex marriage define marriage as an institution between one man and one woman. Theyargue that a gay relationship is not an optimal environ-ment in which to raise children and that it goes againstthe traditional American value system. In addition,many people oppose homosexuality and same-sex mar-riage based on their religious beliefs, including the fol-lowing: (1) that homosexuality is wrong because itinvolves sex that doesn't create life, (2) that homosex-uality is \"unnatural\" (that God created men and womenwith the innate capacities for sexual relations that aredistinctly absent from a same-sex relationship), and (3) that it is discouraged (or forbidden) by the Bible. Proponents of same-sex marriage believe that the issue has to do with equality, pure and simple. They 4092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 636CHAPTER 30 Issues Related to Human Sexuality and Gender Dysphoria 637 believe that all loving, consenting adult couples have the same rights under the law. They cite the real nature ofmarriage as a binding commitment (legally, socially, andpersonally) between two people, and they believe thatindividuals of the same gender have an equal right tomake such a commitment to each other as do hetero-sexual couples. Regarding the rearing of children, re-search has suggested that having a gay or lesbian parentdoes not affect a child's social adjustment, school success,or sexual orientation (Wainright, Russell, & Patterson,2004). The American Academy of Pediatrics (2013) hasissued the following statement: \"There is extensive re-search documenting that there is no causal relationshipbetween parents' sexual orientation and children's emo-tional, psychosocial, and behavioral development.\" Nurses must examine their personal attitudes and feelings about homosexuality. They must be able torecognize when negative feelings are compromisingthe care they give. Increasing numbers of homosexu-als are being honest about their sexual orientation.Health-care workers must ensure that these individu-als receive care with dignity, which is the right of allhuman beings. Nurses who have come to terms withtheir own feelings about homosexuality are betterable to separate the person from the behavior. Un-conditional acceptance of each individual is an essen-tial component of compassionate nursing. Bisexuality A bisexual person is not exclusively heterosexual orhomosexual; he or she engages in sexual activity withmembers of both genders. Bisexuals are also some-times referred to as ambisexual. Bisexuality is more common than exclusive homo- sexuality. Statistics suggest that approximately 75 per-cent of all men are exclusively heterosexual and only2 percent are exclusively homosexual, leaving a rela-tively large percentage who have engaged in sexualactivity with both men and women. A diversity of sexual preferences exists among bi- sexuals. Some individuals prefer men and womenequally, whereas others have a preference for onegender but also accept sexual activity with the othergender. Some bisexuals may alternate between homo-sexual and heterosexual activity for long periods; oth-ers may have both a male and a female lover at thesame time. Whereas some individuals maintain theirbisexual orientation throughout their lives, othersmay become exclusively homosexual or heterosexual. Predisposing Factors Little research exists on the etiology of bisexuality. Asstated previously, Freud (1930) believed that all hu-mans are inherently bisexual; that is, he believed thatall individuals have the capacity for both heterosexualand homosexual interactions. Much research on the development of homosexual- ity rests on the assumption that it is somehow deter-mined by pathological conditions in childhood. Manyheterosexual individuals, however, have their first ho-mosexual encounter later in life. It is unlikely that aninitial homosexual encounter that occurs in the 30s or40s was determined by a pathological condition that oc-curred when the individual was 3 or 4 years old. Someencounters, too, are based solely on the situation, suchas the heterosexual man who engages in homosexualbehavior while in prison, and then returns to hetero-sexuality following his release. This behavior most likelywas determined by circumstances rather than a patho-logical process that occurred in childhood. Gender identity (determining whether one is male or female) is usually established by the age of 2 to 3 years. Sexual identity (determining whether one isheterosexual or homosexual or both) may continueto evolve throughout one's lifetime. Sexually Transmitted Diseases Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) refer to infec-tions that are contracted primarily through sexualactivities or intimate contact with the genitals,mouth, or rectum of another individual. They maybe transmitted from one person to another throughheterosexual or homosexual contact, and externalgenital evidence of pathology may or may not bemanifested. STDs are at epidemic levels in the United States. Individuals are beginning an active sex life at an ear-lier age. More women are sexually active than ever be-fore. The social changes that may have contributedto the increase in STDs are sometimes referred to asthe three Ps: permissiveness, promiscuity, and the pill.The widespread knowledge that antibiotics were avail-able to cure infections and the availability of oral contraceptives to prevent pregnancy resulted in sig-nificant increases in promiscuity and the subsequentexposure to and spread of STDs. A primary nursing responsibility in STD control is education that is aimed at prevention of the disease.Nurses must know which diseases are most prevalent,how they are transmitted, their signs and symptoms,available treatment, and consequences of avoidingtreatment (Table 30-2). They must teach this infor-mation to clients in hospitals and clinics and take anactive role in programs of education in the commu-nity. Early education is important to decrease thespread of STDs. STDs have a particularly emotive significance be- cause they can be transmitted between sexual part-ners. Consequently, STDs carry strong connotations4092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 637638 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial AdaptationGonorrhea sterility from orchitis or epididymitis chronic inflammatory disease, infertility, ectopic pregnancy,blindness from gonococcalconjunctivitis Latent stage: lasts many years; no symptoms, but can bepassed on to fetus Tertiary stage: blindness; heart disease; insanity; ulceratedlesions on skin, Scarring the fallopian tubes, ectopic genital- sex, via hand mois-tened with infectedsecretions and placed incontact with mucousmembranes (e.g., theeyes) Vaginal sex, anal sex, mucous abraded skin with infected secretions andplaced in contact with infected areas, tonewborn through vaginaldeliveryTABLE 30-2 Sexually Transmitted Diseases DISEASE ORGANISM OF TRANSMISSION METHOD OF TRANSMISSION SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS TREATMENT POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS4092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 638CHAPTER 30 Issues Related to Human Sexuality and Gender Dysphoria 639Genital warts Hepatitis B AIDSCondyloma acuminatum (human papilloma virus) andto treat infections.

Janet (age 30) tells Carol, thepsychiatric nurse practitioner, that she and her husbandBert (age 32) have been married for 2 years, and that shegave birth 4 months ago to their first child, a boy theynamed Jason. Jason has been a difficult baby, was diag-nosed with colic, and is wakeful and cries much of thetime. Janet is sleep-deprived and continuously fatigued.Janet states, \"I'm not depressed. I'm just exhausted! Bertis a computer analyst and is gone from home about 10 hours a day. When he gets home, we do what we canto put some dinner together and take care of Jason at thesame time. By 9 o'clock, I'm ready to collapse, and Bertwants to go to bed and make love. I just don't have theenergy. It's starting to cause a lot of friction in our marriage.Bert gets so angry when I refuse his advances. He alsogets angry when I passively comply with his advances. Tobe honest, I'm just not interested in sex anymore. I cer-tainly don't want to risk another pregnancy. But I also don'twant to risk losing my husband. We used to have such agreat sexual relationship, but that seems like another life-time ago. I don't know what to do!\" NURSING DIAGNOSIS/OUTCOME IDENTIFICATION From the assessment data, the nurse develops the follow- ing nursing diagnosis for Janet: Sexual dysfunction related to extreme fatigue and depressed mood evidenced by loss of sexual desire. a.Short- Term Goals Client will identify ways to receive respite from child care. Client will identify ways to devote time to regain satisfactory sexual relationship with husband. b.Long-T erm Goal: Client will resume sexual activity at a level satisfactory to herself and her husband. PLANNING/IMPLEMENTATION SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION The following nursing interventions have been identified for Janet:1.Take Janet's sexual history. 2.Determine the previous level of satisfaction in currentsexual relationship.3.Assess Janet's perception of the problem. 4.Suggest alternative strategies for resolution of the problem. (Because of Janet's fatigue and mild depres-sion, she may not be able to adequately problem-solvethe situation without assistance). a. Respite from child care (e.g., babysitting service, Mom's Day Out program, sharing babysitting withother mothers, grandparents). b. Schedule regular \"date nights\" with husband. c. Schedule periodic weekends away with husband. 5.Provide information regarding sexuality and sexual functioning. 6.Discuss with Janet her fear of pregnancy. Provide information about various methods of contraception. 7.Make referral to sex therapist, if Janet requests this service. EVALUATION The outcome criteria for Janet have been met. She wasable to identify ways to receive respite from child care. Shetakes Jason to Mom's Day Out at her church every Fridaymorning. She now has an agreement with another newmother to trade one afternoon a week of babysitting duties.She inquired at the local community college in the depart-ment of early childhood education for names of studentswho would be interested in babysitting. Gina, a 19-year-oldsophomore at the college, now babysits for Janet and Bertevery Wednesday evening while they have a \"date night.\"And one weekend a month, Bert's widowed mother stayswith Jason while Janet and Bert have time away together.Her OB/GYN prescribed oral contraceptives, and Janet'sfear of pregnancy has subsided. Janet's mood has liftedand she looks forward to her \"free\" time, and time alonewith her husband. She reports that her sexual desire hasincreased, and that she and Bert now enjoy a satisfactorysexual relationship. She also states that she feels she is giv-ing more quality care to Jason now that she has the periodsof respite to which she looks forward every week. 4092_Ch30_608-645 25/07/14 10:22 AM Page 640CHAPTER 30 Issues Related to Human Sexuality and Gender Dysphoria 641 Summary and Key Points Paraphilic disorders are a group of behaviors in- volving sexual activity with nonhuman objects ornonconsenting partners or that involve sufferingto others. Types of paraphilic disorders include exhibitionisticdisorder, fetishistic disorder, frotteuristic disorder,pedophilic disorder, sexual disorder,sexual sadism disorder, transvestic disorder, andvoyeuristic disorder. Sexual dysfunctions are disturbances that occur inany of the phases of the normal human sexual re-sponse cycle. Types of sexual dysfunctions include sexual desiredisorders, sexual arousal disorders, orgasmic disor-ders, and sexual pain disorders. Biological treatment of paraphilic disorders in-volves decreasing the level of circulating androgens. Psychoanalytic treatment of paraphilic disordersfocuses on helping the individual resolve earlyconflicts, thus relieving the anxiety that preventshim or her from forming appropriate sexual relationships. Behavior therapy for paraphilic disorders includesuse of aversion techniques, covert sensitization,and satiation. Nurses may best become involved in the treatmentof paraphilic disorders at the primary level of prevention. Treatment of sexual dysfunction disorders involves avariety of techniques, including cognitive therapy, sys-tematic desensitization, and sensate focus exercises. Several medications are available for the treatment oferectile disorder. These include sildenafil (Viagra),tadalafil (Cialis), vardenafil (Levitra), and avanafil(Stendra). Others are currently under investigation. Gender dysphoria occurs when there is incongru-ence between anatomical sex and the assigned gen-der role. Individuals with gender dysphoria experience ex-treme discomfort in the assigned gender and desireto be, or insist that they are, the opposite gender. Variations in sexual orientation include homosex-uality and bisexuality. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) refer to infec-tions that are contracted primarily through sexualactivities or intimate contact with the genitals,mouth, or rectum of another individual. STDs are at epidemic levels in the United States.Prevention is the ideal goal, but early detection andappropriate treatment continue to be consideredrealistic objectives. Nurses are in an excellent position to provide theeducation required for prevention, as well as thephysical treatment and social and emotional sup-port to assist clients with STDs regain and maintainoptimal wellness. Human sexuality influences all aspects of physicaland mental health. Clients are becoming more opento discussing matters pertaining to sexuality, and itis therefore important for nurses to integrate infor-mation on sexuality into the care they give. This canbe done by focusing on preventive, therapeutic, andeducational interventions to assist individuals to at-tain, regain, or maintain sexual wellness.

HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT Please read the chapter and answer the following questions: 1.There is some speculation that anorexia nervosa may be associated with a primarydysfunction of which brain structure? 2.What is the level of body mass index (BMI)that is associated with the definition of obesity?3.Individuals with anorexia nervosa have a\"distor ted body image. \" What does this mean? 4.What physiological signs may be associatedwith the excessive vomiting of the purg ing syndrome? Nutrition is required to sustain life, and most individ- uals acquire nutrients from eating food; however, nu-trition and life sustenance are not the only reasonsmost people eat food. Indeed, in an affluent culture,life sustenance may not even be a consideration. It issometimes difficult to remember that many peoplewithin this affluent American culture, as well as allover the world, are starving from lack of food. The hypothalamus contains the appetite regulation center within the brain. This complex neural system 31 Eating Disorders CORE CONCEPTS anorexia body imagebulimia 6464092_Ch31_646-668 24/07/14 5:32 PM Page 646CHAPTER 31 Eating Disorders 647 regulates the body's ability to recognize when it is hun- gry and when it has been sated. Halmi (2008) states: Eating behavior is now known to reflect an interac- tion between an organism's physiological state andenvironmental state, metabolicrate, condition of the gastrointestinal tract, amountof storage tissue, and sensory receptors for taste andsmell. Environmental conditions include features ofthe food such as taste, texture, novelty, accessibility,and nutritional composition, and other external con-ditions such as ambient temperature, presence ofother people, and stress. (p. 971) Society and culture have a great deal of influence on eating behaviors. Eating is a social activity; seldom does an event of any social significance occur withoutthe presence of food. Yet, society and culture also in-fluence how people (and in particular, women) mustlook. History reveals a regularity of fluctuation in whatsociety has considered desirable in the human femalebody. Archives and historical paintings from the 16thand 17th centuries reveal that plump, full-figuredwomen were considered fashionable and desirable. Inthe Victorian era, beauty was characterized by a slen-der, wan appearance that continued through the flap-per era of the 1920s. During the Depression era andWorld War II, the full-bodied woman was again ad-mired, only to be superseded in the late 1960s by theimage of the superthin models propagated by themedia, which remains the ideal of today. As it has beensaid, \"A woman can't be too rich or too thin.\" Eatingdisorders, as we know them, can refute this concept. This chapter explores the disorders associated with undereating and overeating. Because psychologicalor behavioral factors play a potential role in the pres-entation of these disorders, they fall well within therealm of psychiatry and psychiatric nursing. Epidemi-ological statistics are presented along with predispos-ing factors that have been implicated in the etiologyof anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and obesity. Anexplanation of the symptomatology is presented asbackground knowledge for assessing the client withan eating disorder. Nursing care is described in thecontext of the nursing process. Various treatmentmodalities are explored. Epidemiological Factors Reports have indicated that the prevalence ofanorexia nervosa has increased since the mid-20th century, both in the United States and in Western Europe (Halmi, 2008). Studies indicate a prevalencerate for anorexia nervosa among young women in theUnited States of approximately 1 percent (Black &Andreasen, 2011). The disorder occurs predomi-nantly in females 12 to 30 years of age. Fewer than 10percent of the cases are male. Anorexia nervosa wasonce believed to be more prevalent in the higher so-cioeconomic classes, but evidence is lacking to sup-port this hypothesis. Bulimia nervosa is more prevalent than anorexia nervosa, with estimates up to 4 percent of youngwomen (Black & Andreasen, 2011). Onset of bulimianervosa occurs in late adolescence or early adult-hood. Cross-cultural research suggests that bulimianervosa occurs primarily in societies that place em-phasis on thinness as the model of attractiveness forwomen and where an abundance of food is available. Obesity has been defined as a body mass index (BMI) (weight/height 2) of 30 or greater. In the United States, statistics indicate that, among adults 20 years ofage or older, 68.5 percent are overweight, with morethan 35 percent of these in the obese range (Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012). Thepercentage of obese individuals is higher in AfricanAmericans and Latino Americans than among thewhite population (CDC, 2012). The prevalence of obe-sity is greater among the lower socioeconomic group(Halmi, 2008), and there is an inverse relationship be-tween obesity and level of education (CDC, 2012). Thelatest figures from the CDC indicate that 6.3 percentof the U.S. adult population may be categorized as ex- tremely obese, which is defined by the National Insti- tutes of Health as a BMI greater than 40 (CDC, 2012). Application of the Nursing Process Background Assessment Data (Anorexia Nervosa) CORE CONCEPT Anorexia Prolonged loss of appetite. CORE CONCEPT Body Image A subjective concept of one's physical appearance based on the personal perceptions of self and the reactions of others. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by a morbid fear of obesity. Symptoms include gross distortion of bodyimage, preoccupation with food, and refusal to eat.The term anorexia is actually a misnomer. It was ini- tially believed that individuals with anorexia nervosa4092_Ch31_646-668 24/07/14 5:32 PM Page 647did not experience sensations of hunger. However, research indicates that they do indeed suffer frompangs of hunger, and it is only with food intake of lessthan 200 calories per day that hunger sensations actually cease. The distortion in body image is manifested by the individual's perception of being \"fat\" when he or sheis obviously underweight or even emaciated (exces- sively thin). Weight loss is usually accomplished by reduction in food intake and often extensive exercis-ing. Self-induced vomiting and the abuse of laxativesor diuretics also may occur. Weight loss is excessive. For example, the individual may present for health-care services weighing less than85 percent of expected weight. Other symptoms includehypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, lanugo,and sence of menstruation) usually follows weight loss, butsometimes it happens early on in the disorder, even before severe weight loss has occurred. Individuals with anorexia nervosa may be obsessed with food. For example, they may hoard or conceal food,talk about food and recipes at great length, or prepareelaborate meals for others, only to restrict themselves toa limited amount of low-calorie food intake. Compulsivebehaviors, such as hand washing, may also be present. Age at onset is usually early to late adolescence and psychosexual development is often delayed. Feelingsof depression and anxiety often accompany the disor-der. In fact, some studies have suggested a possible in-terrelationship between eating disorders and affectivedisorders. Box 31-1 outlines the Diagnostic and StatisticalManual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (APA, 2013) diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa. Background Assessment Data (Bulimia Nervosa)648 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation BOX 31-1 Diagnostic Criteria for Anorexia Nervosa A. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health. Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is less than minimally normal, or, for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected. B. Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight. C. Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight. Specify whether: Restricting Type: During the last 3 months, the individual has not engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating or purging behavior (i.e., self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas). This subtype describes presenta- tions in which weight loss is accomplished primarily through dieting, fasting, and/or excessive exercise. Binge-Eating/Purging Type: During the last 3 months, the individual has engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating or purging behavior (i.e., self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas).

American Psychiatric Association.CORE CONCEPT Bulimia Excessive, insatiable appetite. Bulimia nervosa is an episodic, uncontrolled, compul- sive, rapid ingestion of large quantities of food over ashort period of time (binging ), followed by inappro- priate compensatory behaviors to rid the body of theexcess calories. The food consumed during a bingeoften has a high caloric content, a sweet taste, and asoft or smooth texture that can be eaten rapidly,sometimes even without being chewed (Sadock &Sadock, 2007). The binging episodes often occur insecret and are usually only terminated by abdominaldiscomfort, sleep, social interruption, or self-inducedvomiting. Although the eating binges may bring pleas-ure while they are occurring, self-degradation and depressed mood commonly follow. To rid the body of the excessive calories, the individ- ual may engage in purging behaviors (self-induced vom- iting, or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas)or other inappropriate compensatory behaviors, suchas fasting or excessive exercise. There is a persistentoverconcern with personal appearance, particularly 4092_Ch31_646-668 24/07/14 5:32 PM Page 648CHAPTER 31 Eating Disorders 649 regarding how they believe others perceive them. Weight fluctuations are common because of the alter-nating binges and fasts. However, most individuals withbulimia nervosa are within a normal weight range\u2014some slightly underweight, some slightly overweight. Excessive vomiting and laxative or diuretic abuse may lead to problems with dehydration and elec-trolyte imbalance. Gastric acid in the vomitus alsocontributes to the erosion of tooth enamel. In rare in-stances, the individual may experience tears in thegastric or esophageal mucosa. Some people with this disorder are subject to mood disorders, anxiety disorders, or substance abuse, mostfrequently involving central nervous central (CNS)stimulants or alcohol. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa are presented in Box 31-2. Predisposing Factors Associated with Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa Biological Influences Genetics A hereditary predisposition to eating disor- ders has been hypothesized on the basis of family his-tories and an apparent association with otherdisorders for which the likelihood of genetic influ-ences exists. In their study of monozygotic and dizy-gotic twins, Bulik and associates (2006) concludedthat genetic factors account for 56 percent of the riskfor developing anorexia nervosa. Other genetic stud- ies have suggested possible linkage sites for anorexianer vosa on chromosomes 1, 2, and 13 (Halmi, 2008). Anorexia nervosa is more common among sisters andmothers of those with the disorder than among thegeneral population. Several studies have reported ahigher than expected frequency of mood and sub-stance use disorders among first-degree biological rel-atives of individuals with eating disorders (Puri &Treasaden, 2011). Neuroendocrine Abnormalities Some speculation has oc- curred regarding a primary hypothalamic dysfunction in anorexia ner vosa. Studies consistent with this theory have revealed elevated cerebrospinal fluid cortisol levels and a possible impairment of dopaminergic regulationin individuals with anorexia nervosa (Halmi, 2008). Additional evidence in the etiological implication of hypothalamic dysfunction is gathered from the fact thatmany people with anorexia nervosa experience amen-orrhea before the onset of starvation and significantweight loss. Neurochemical Influences. Neurochemical influences in bulimia ne rvosa may be associated with the neurotrans- mitters serotonin and norepinephrine. This hypothesis has been supported by the positive response these in-dividuals have shown to therapy with the selective sero-tonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Some studies havefound high levels of endogenous opioids in the spinalfluid of clients with anorexia nervosa, promoting thespeculation that these chemicals may contribute to de-nial of hunger (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Some of theseindividuals have been shown to gain weight when givennaloxone, an opioid antagonist. Psychodynamic Influences Psychodynamic theories suggest that eating disordersresult from very early and profound disturbances in BOX 31-2 Diagnostic Criteria for Bulimia Nervosa A. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following: 1. Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period) an amount of food that is definitely larger than most individuals would eat during a similar period of time and under similar circumstances. 2. A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating). B. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors in order to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise. C. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average, at least once a week for 3 months. D. Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.E. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa. Specify if: In partial remissionIn full remission Specify current severity: Mild: An average of 1-3 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week.Moderate: An average of 4-7 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week. Severe: An average of 8-13 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week. Extreme: An average of 14 or more episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week.

This problem is compoundedwhen the mother responds to the child's physical andemotional needs with food. Manifestations include adisturbance in body identity and a distortion in bodyimage. When events occur that threaten the vulnerableego, feelings of lack of control over one's body (self)emerge. Behaviors associated with food and eatingserve to provide feelings of control over one's life. Family Influences Conflict Avoidance In the theory of the family as a sys-tem, psychosomatic symptoms, including anorexianervosa, are reinforced in an effort to avoid spousal conflict. Parents are able to deny marital conflict bydefining the sick child as the family problem. In thesefamilies, there is an unhealthy involvement betweenthe members (enmeshment); the members strive atall costs to maintain \"appearances\"; and the parentsendeavor to retain the child in the dependent posi-tion. Conflict avoidance may be a strong factor in theinterpersonal dynamics of some families in whichchildren develop eating disorders. Elements of Power and Contr ol The issue of control may become the overriding factor in the family of the client with an eating disorder. These families oftenconsist of a passive father , a domineering mother, and an overly dependent child. A high value is placed onperfectionism in this family, and the child feels he orshe must satisfy these standards. Parental criticismpromotes an increase in obsessive and perfectionisticbehavior on the part of the child, who continues toseek love, approval, and recognition. The child even-tually begins to feel helpless and ambivalent towardthe parents. In adolescence, these distorted eatingpatterns may represent a rebellion against the par-ents, viewed by the child as a means of gaining andremaining in control. The symptoms are often trig-gered by a stressor that the adolescent perceives as aloss of control in some aspect of his or her life. Background Assessment Data (Obesity) Obesity is not classified as a psychiatric disorder in theDSM-5, but because of the strong emotional factorsand the potential serious health consequences asso-ciated with the condition, it may be considered under\"Psychological Factors Affecting Medical Condition.\" Binge-eating disorder (BED) is also described as an eat- ing disorder in the DSM-5 (APA, 2013). Obesity is a factor in BED because the individual binges on large amountsof food (as in bulimia nervosa) but does not engage inbehaviors to rid the body of the excess calories. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for BED are presented in Box 31-3.650 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation BOX 31-3 Diagnostic Criteria for Binge-Eating Disorder A. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following: 1. Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most people would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances 2. A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating) B. The binge-eating episodes are associated with 3 (or more) of the following: 1. Eating much more rapidly than normal 2. Eating until feeling uncomfortably full 3. Eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry 4. Eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating 5. Feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or very guilty after overeating C. Marked distress regarding binge eating is present.D. The binge eating occurs, on average, at least once a week for 3 months.E. The binge eating is not associated with the recurrent use of inappropriate compensatory behavior as in bulimia nervosa and does not occur exclusively during the course of bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa. Specify if: In partial remissionIn full binge-eating episodes per week Extreme: 14 or more binge-eating episodes per week Reprinted with permission from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (Copyright 2013). American Psychiatric Association.4092_Ch31_646-668 24/07/14 5:32 PM Page 650CHAPTER 31 Eating Disorders 651 The following formula is used to determine extent of obesity in an individual: Weight (kg)Body mass index =Height (m)2 The BMI range for normal weight is 20 to 24.9. Studies by the National Center for Health Statistics indicate that overweight is defined as a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 (based on U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Amer-icans). Based on criteria of the World Health Or-ganization, obesity is defined as a BMI of 30.0 or greater. These guidelines, which were released bythe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute inJuly 1998, markedly increased the number of Amer-icans considered to be overweight. The averageAmerican woman has a BMI of 26, and fashion mod-els typically have BMIs of 18. Anorexia nervosa ischaracterized by a BMI of 17.5 or lower (Black &Andreasen, 2011). Table 31-1 presents an exampleof some BMIs based on weight (in pounds) andheight (in inches). Individuals who are obese often present with hypertension and hyperlipidemia, particularly elevatedtriglyceride and cholesterol levels. They commonlyhave hyperglycemia and are at risk for developing dia-betes mellitus. Osteoarthritis may be evi dent because of trauma to weight-bearing joints. Workload on theheart and lungs is increased, often leading to symp-toms of angina or respiratory insufficiency.Predisposing Factors Associated With Obesity Biological Influences Genetics Genetics have been implicated in the devel-opment of obesity in that 80 percent of offspring oftwo obese parents are obese (Halmi, 2008). Studiesof twins and adoptees reared by normal and over- weight parents have also supported this implicationof heredity as a predisposing factor to obesity . Stud- ies regarding the genetics of obesity are ongoing.Choquet and Meyre (2011) reported, \"Recent dis-coveries in genetics have found that people differ intheir perceptions of hunger and satiety on a geneticbasis, and that predisposed subgroups of the popu-lation may be particularly vulnerable to obesity in'obesogenic' societies with unlimited access to food\"(p. 174). Physiological Factors Lesions in the appetite and satiety centers in the hypothalamus may contribute to overeating and lead to obesity. Hypothyroidism is a problem that inter feres with basal metabolism and may lead to weight gain. Weight gain can also occur in response to the decreased insulin pro-duction of diabetes mellitus and the increased cortisone production of Cushing's disease. Some ev-idence also exists to indicate that low levels of theneurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine[5-HT]) may play a role in compulsive eating(Uceyler et al., 2010). IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE Long, J.D., and Stevens, K.R. (2004). Using technology to promote self-efficacy for healthy eating in adoles-cents. Journal of Nursing Scholarship, 36(2), 134-139. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: Obesity and overweight have reached epidemic proportions and they are risk factors forthe development of chronic disease. The purpose of thisstudy was to test the effects of a classroom and World WideWeb (WWW) educational intervention on self-efficacy forhealthy eating. The sample consisted of 63 adolescents inthe participant group and 58 in the control group. The agerange was between 12 and 16 years. The participant groupreceived the intervention that consisted of 10 hours ofclassroom and 5 hours of Web-based nutrition educationendorsed by the American Cancer Society and the NationalCancer Institute. Information is included to encouragehealthy eating behaviors that reduce the risk of cancer, obe-sity, heart disease and diabetes. Participants in the controlgroup received the nutrition education integrated in the health, science, and home economics curriculum. Allparticipants completed six questionnaires to measure di-etary knowledge and eating behaviors. Pre- and post-testswere administered to both groups. RESULTS OF THE STUDY: Although no difference in food con- sumption was found between groups during the month of intervention, the participant group had significantly higherscores related to knowledge of good nutrition and healthyeating behaviors. The study was limited to individual ado-lescents and did not attempt to initiate change in the homeor school environment. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Nurses, and es- pecially school nurses, can become actively involved in nutrition education for children and adolescents. The au-thors report that 9 million young people are overweight\u2014a number that more than doubled in the last 20 years.This has serious implications for nursing to assist in theeducational process needed to reverse this unhealthytrend.4092_Ch31_646-668 24/07/14 5:32 PM Page 651652 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial AdaptationTABLE 31-1 Body Mass Index (BMI) Chart B M I1 92 02 12 22 32 4 2 52 62 72 82 93 03 13 2 3 33 43 53 63 73 83 94 0 HEIGHT (INCHES) BODY WEIGHT (POUNDS) 58 91 96 100 105 110 115 119 124 129 134 138 143 148 153 158 162 167 172 177 181 186 191 59 94 99 104 109 114 119 124 128 133 138 143 148 153 158 163 168 173 178 183 188 193 198 60 97 102 107 112 118 123 128 133 138 143 148 153 158 163 168 174 179 184 189 194 199 20461 100 106 111 116 122 127 132 137 143 148 153 158 164 169 174 180 185 190 195 201 206 21162 104 109 115 120 126 131 136 142 147 153 158 164 169 175 180 186 191 196 202 207 213 21863 107 113 118 124 130 135 141 146 152 158 163 169 175 180 186 191 197 203 208 214 220 22564 110 116 122 128 134 140 145 151 157 163 169 174 180 186 192 197 204 209 215 221 227 23265 114 120 126 132 138 144 150 156 162 168 174 180 186 192 198 204 210 216 222 228 234 24066 118 124 130 136 142 148 155 161 167 173 179 186 192 198 204 210 216 223 229 235 241 24767 121 127 134 140 146 153 159 166 172 178 185 191 198 204 211 217 223 230 236 242 249 25568 125 131 138 144 151 158 164 171 177 184 190 197 203 210 216 223 230 236 243 249 256 26269 128 135 142 149 155 162 169 176 182 189 196 203 209 216 223 230 236 243 250 257 263 27070 132 139 146 153 160 167 174 181 188 195 202 209 216 222 229 236 243 250 257 264 271 27871 136 143 150 157 165 172 179 186 193 200 208 215 222 229 236 243 250 257 265 272 279 28672 140 147 154 162 169 177 184 191 199 206 213 221 228 235 242 250 258 265 272 279 287 29473 144 151 159 166 174 182 189 197 204 212 219 227 235 242 250 257 265 272 280 288 295 30274 148 155 163 171 179 186 194 202 210 218 225 233 241 249 256 264 272 280 287 295 303 31175 152 160 168 176 184 192 200 208 216 224 232 240 248 256 264 272 279 287 295 303 311 319 76 156 164 172 180 189 197 205 213 221 230 238 246 254 263 271 279 287 295 304 312 320 328 SOURCE: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health (2013).4092_Ch31_646-668 24/07/14 5:32 PM Page 652CHAPTER 31 Eating Disorders 653 Lifestyle Factors On a more basic level, obesity can be viewed as the ingestion of a greater number of calo- ries than are expended. Weight gain occurs when caloric intake exceeds caloric output in terms of basalmetabolism and physical activity . Many overweight individuals lead sedentary lifestyles, making it very difficult to burn off calories. Psychosocial Influences The psychoanalytic view of obesity proposes that obeseindividuals have unresolved dependency needs and arefixed in the oral stage of psychosexual development.The symptoms of obesity are viewed as depressiveequivalents, attempts to regain \"lost\" or frustrated nur-turance and caring. Depression and binge eating arestrongly linked. As many as half of individuals with BEDhave a history of depression (Jaret, 2010). Depressionmay be a cause of binge eating when food providescomfort for the despondent mood. BED can also leadto depression, with respect to the feelings of disgustand despair that occur following episodes of binging. Diagnosis/Outcome Identification Nursing diagnoses are formulated from the data gath-ered during the assessment phase and with backgroundknowledge regarding predisposing factors to the disor-der. Table 31-2 presents a list of client behaviors and the NANDA nursing diagnoses that correspond tothose behaviors, which may be used in planning carefor clients with eating disorders. Outcome Criteria The following criteria may be used for measurement ofoutcomes in the care of the client with eating disorders: The client: Has achieved and maintained at least 80 percent ofexpected body weight. Has vital signs, blood pressure, and laboratoryserum studies within normal limits. Verbalizes importance of adequate nutrition. Verbalizes knowledge regarding consequences offluid loss caused by self-induced vomiting (or laxative/diuretic abuse) and importance of adequate fluidintake. Verbalizes events that precipitate anxiety and demon-strates techniques for its reduction. Verbalizes ways in which he or she may gain morecontrol of the environment and thereby reducefeelings of powerlessness. Expresses interest in welfare of others and less pre-occupation with own appearance. Verbalizes that image of body as \"fat\" was misper-ception and demonstrates ability to take control ofown life without resorting to maladaptive eating be-haviors (anorexia nervosa).

Verbalizes plans for future maintenance of weightcontrol (obesity). Planning/Implementation In most instances, individuals with eating disorders aretreated on an outpatient basis, but in some cases hospi-talization becomes necessary. Reasons for hospitaliza-tion include the following: malnutrition (less than 85%of expected body weight), dehydration, severe elec-trolyte imbalance, cardiac arrhythmia, bradycar-dia, hypothermia, hypotension, suicidal ideation, oruncooperative outpatient treatment (Yager et al., 2006). The following section presents a group of selected nursing diagnoses, with short- and long-term goalsand nursing interventions for each. Imbalanced Nutrition: Less Than Body Requirements/Deficient Fluid Volume (Risk for or Actual) Imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements is de- fined as \"intake of nutrients insufficient to meet meta- bolic needs\" (NANDA International [NANDA-I],2012, p. 174). as \"de- creased intravascular, interstitial, and/or intracellularfluid\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 31-3 presentsthese nursing diagnoses in care plan format.Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goals The client will gain ___ pounds per week (amountto be established by client, nurse, and dietitian). The client will drink 125 mL of fluid each hourduring waking hours. Long-Term Goal By time of discharge from treatment, the client will exhibitno signs or symptoms of malnutrition or dehydration. Interventions For the client who is emaciated and is unable orunwilling to maintain an adequate oral intake, thephysician may order a liquid diet to be adminis-tered via nasogastric tube. Without adequate nutri-tion, a life-threatening situation exists. Nursingcare of the individual receiving tube feedingsshould be administered according to establishedhospital procedures. For the client who is able and willing to consumean oral diet, the dietitian should determine the ap-propriate number of calories required to provideadequate nutrition and realistic (according to bodystructure and height) weight gain.

Do not focus on food and eating specifically. Instead,focus on the emotional issues that have precipitatedthese behaviors. Do not discuss food or eating with the client onceprotocol has been established. Do, however, offersupport and positive reinforcement for obvious im-provements in eating behaviors. Keep a strict record of intake and output. Weigh theclient daily immediately on arising and followingfirst voiding. Always use the same scale, if possible.Assess skin turgor and integrity regularly. Assessmoistness and color of oral mucous membranes.The condition of the skin and mucous membranesprovides valuable data regarding client hydration.Discourage the client from bathing every day if theskin is very dry. Sit with the client during mealtimes for supportand to observe the amount ingested. A limit (usu-ally 30 minutes) should be imposed on time allot-ted for meals. Without a time limit, meals canbecome lengthy, drawn-out sessions, providing theclient with attention based on food and eating.4092_Ch31_646-668 24/07/14 5:32 PM Page 655The client should be observed for at least 1 hour following meals. The client may use this time to dis-card food that has been stashed from the food trayor to engage in self-induced vomiting. He or shemay need to be accompanied to the bathroom ifself-induced vomiting is suspected. If weight loss occurs, enforce restrictions. Restric-tions and limits must be established and carried outconsistently to avoid power struggles and to en-courage client compliance with therapy. Ensure that the client and family understand thatif nutritional status deteriorates, tube feedings willbe initiated. This is implemented in a matter-of-fact, nonpunitive way, for the client's safety andprotection from a life-threatening condition. Encourage the client to explore and identify the truefeelings and fears that contribute to maladaptive eat-ing behaviors. Emotional issues must be resolved ifthese maladaptive responses are to be eliminated. Ineffective Denial Ineffective denial is defined as a \"conscious or uncon- scious attempt to disavow the knowledge or meaningof an event to reduce anxiety and/or fear, leading tothe detriment of health\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 358). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal The client will verbalize understanding of the cor-relation between emotional issues and maladaptiveeating behaviors (within time deemed appropriatefor individual client). Long-Term Goal By time of discharge from treatment, the client willdemonstrate the ability to discontinue use of mal-adaptive eating behaviors and to cope with emo-tional issues in a more adaptive manner. Interventions Establish a trusting relationship with the client bybeing honest, accepting, and available, and by keepingall promises. Convey unconditional positive regard. Acknowledge the client's anger at feelings of lossof control brought about by the established eatingregimen associated with the program of behaviormodification. Anger is a normal human response,and should be expressed in an appropriate man-ner. Feelings that are not expressed remain unre-solved and add an additional component to analready serious situation. Avoid arguing or bargaining with the client who isresistant to treatment. State matter-of-factly which be-haviors are unacceptable and how privileges will berestricted for noncompliance. It is essential that allstaff members are consistent with this intervention.Encourage the client to verbalize feelings regard-ing his or her role within the family and issues re-lated to dependence/independence, the intenseneed for achievement, and sexuality. Help theclient recognize how maladaptive eating behaviorsmay be related to these emotional issues. Discussways in which he or she can gain control over theseproblematic areas of life without resorting to mal-adaptive eating behaviors. Imbalanced Nutrition: More Than Body Requirements Imbalanced nutrition: more than body requirements is de- fined as \"intake of nutrients that exceeds metabolicneeds\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 175). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal Client will verbalize understanding of what must bedone to lose weight. Long-Term Goal Client will demonstrate a change in eating patternsthat results in a steady weight loss. Interventions Encourage the client to keep a diary of food intake.A food diary provides the opportunity for the clientto gain a realistic picture of the amount of food in-gested and provides a database on which to tailorthe dietary program. Discuss feelings and emotions associated with eat-ing. This helps to identify when the client is eatingto satisfy an emotional need rather than a physio-logical one. With input from the client, formulate an eatingplan that includes food from the required foodgroups with emphasis on low-fat intake. It is helpfulto keep the plan as similar to the client's usual eat-ing pattern as possible. The diet must eliminatecalories while maintaining adequate nutrition. Theclient is more likely to stay on the eating plan if heor she is able to participate in its creation and it de-viates as little as possible from usual types of foods. Identify realistic incremental goals for weeklyweight loss. Reasonable weight loss (1 to 2 poundsper week) results in more lasting effects. Excessive,rapid weight loss may result in fatigue and irritabil-ity and ultimately lead to failure in meeting goalsfor weight loss. Motivation is more easily sustainedby meeting \"stair-step\" goals. Plan a progressive exercise program tailored to indi-vidual goals and choice. Exercise may enhance weightloss by burning calories and reducing appetite, in-creasing energy, toning muscles, and enhancingsense of well-being and accomplishment. Walking isan excellent choice for overweight individuals.656 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch31_646-668 24/07/14 5:32 PM Page 656CHAPTER 31 Eating Disorders 657 Discuss the probability of reaching plateaus when weight remains stable for extended periods. Theclient should know this is likely to happen as changesin metabolism occur. Plateaus cause frustration, andthe client may need additional support during thesetimes to remain on the weight-loss program. Provide instruction about medications to assist withweight loss if ordered by the physician. Appetite-suppressant drugs and others that have weight lossas a side effect may be helpful to someone who isseverely overweight. They should be used for thispurpose for only a short period while the individ-ual attempts to adjust to the new pattern of eating. Disturbed Body Image/Low Self-esteem Disturbed body image is defined as \"confusion in mental picture of one's physical self\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 291). Low self-esteem is defined as self-evaluating/ feelings about self or self-capabilities\" (NANDA-I, 2012,pp. 285-287). Client Goals (for the Client With Anorexia Nervosa or Bulimia Nervosa) Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals. Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal The client will verbally acknowledge misperceptionof body image as \"fat\" within specified time (de-pending on severity and chronicity of condition). Long-Term Goal By the time of discharge from treatment, client willdemonstrate an increase in self-esteem as mani-fested by verbalizing positive aspects of self and exhibiting less preoccupation with own appearanceas a more realistic body image is developed. Client Goals (for the Client With Obesity) Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal The client will begin to accept self based on self-at-tributes rather than on appearance. Long-Term Goal The client will pursue loss of weight as desired. Interventions For the client with anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa: Help the client to develop a realistic perception of body image and relationship with food. Comparespecific measurement of the client's body with theclient's perceived calculations. There may be alarge discrepancy between the actual body size andthe client's perception of his or her body size. Theclient needs to recognize that the misperception of body image is unhealthy and that maintaining control through maladaptive eating behaviors isdangerous\u2014even life threatening. Promote feelings of control within the environ-ment through participation and independent de-cision-making. Through positive feedback, helpthe client learn to accept self as is, including weak-nesses as well as strengths. The client must cometo understand that he or she is a capable, au-tonomous individual who can perform outside thefamily unit and who is not expected to be perfect.Control of his or her life must be achieved in otherways besides dieting and weight loss. Help the client realize that perfection is unrealistic,and explore this need with him or her. As the clientbegins to feel better about self, identifies positiveself-attributes, and develops the ability to acceptcertain personal inadequacies, the need for unre-alistic achievement should diminish. For the client with obesity: Assess the client's feelings and attitudes aboutbeing obese. Obesity and compulsive eating behav-iors may have deep-rooted psychological implica-tions, such as compensation for lack of love andnurturing or a defense against intimacy. Ensure that the client has privacy during self-careactivities. The obese individual may be sensitive orself-conscious about his or her body. Have the client recall coping patterns related tofood in family of origin, and explore how thesemay affect current situation. Parents are role mod-els for their children. Maladaptive eating behaviorsare learned within the family system and are sup-ported through positive reinforcement. Food maybe substituted by the parent for affection and love,and eating is associated with a feeling of satisfac-tion, becoming the primary defense. Determine the client's motivation for weight lossand set goals. The individual may harbor repressedfeelings of hostility, which may be expressed in-wardly on the self. Because of a poor self-concept,the person often has difficulty with relationships.When the motivation is to lose weight for someoneelse, successful weight loss is less likely to occur. Help the client identify positive self-attributes.Focus on strengths and past accomplishments un-related to physical appearance. It is important thatself-esteem not be tied solely to size of the body.The client needs to recognize that obesity need not interfere with positive feelings regarding self-concept and self-worth. Refer the client to a support or therapy group. Sup-port groups can provide companionship, increasemotivation, decrease loneliness and social os-tracism, and give practical solutions to common4092_Ch31_646-668 24/07/14 5:32 PM Page 657problems. Group therapy can be helpful in dealing with underlying psychological concerns. Concept Care Mapping The concept map care plan is an innovative approachto planning and organizing nursing care (see Chapter 9).It is a diagrammatic teaching and learning strategythat allows visualization of interrelationships betweenmedical diagnoses, nursing diagnoses, assessmentdata, and treatments. Examples of concept map careplans for clients with eating disorders are presentedin Figures 31-1 and 31-2.

She is 5'10\" tall and had frequently beenteased by her peers because of her height. She lived in a rural community and was often ridiculed for her plan tobecome a model after graduation. But Alice was determined, and instead of going to college, she moved to New Y orkCity to pursue her dream. However, at the first modeling agency, she was told that she would never be accepted formodeling at her weight (140 pounds) and to come back when she had lost at least 15 pounds. She was devastated butsteadfast in her determination to succeed. She cut her calories to 500 a day, exercised relentlessly, took over-the-counter laxatives and diuretics, and engaged in self-induced vomiting when she ate more than she felt she should. Shebecame weak and chronically fatigued but persisted, until yesterday when she collapsed at the gym and the ownercalled 911. She was admitted to the psychiatric unit weighing 118 pounds, with poor skin turgor, blood pressure 75/45,and pulse 60 and irregular. She tells the nurse, \"I can't be a model unless I get thin!

Her mother and sister were both of normal weight, but her mother always said, \"Harriet took after her dad's side of the family.\" Through her teens, she tried innumerable times to lose weight, only to lose a few pounds and then gain back more. In college, out from under the watchful eye of her mother, she has gained even more weight. She has never had a date. Her sister is engaged to be married in 6 months and has asked Harriet to be her maid of honor. Harriet has come to the university student health center to seek assistance with weight loss.

IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE Waller, T., Lampman, C., & Lupfer-Johnson, G. (2012). As- sessing bias against overweight individuals among nurs-ing and psychology students: An implicit association test.Journal of Clinical Nursing, 21 (23-24), 3504-3512. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: Almost 69 percent of adults in the United States are overweight, and more than 3 5 per- cent of those are within the range of obesity. Obesity hasbecome a leading health concern that impacts both phys-ical and psychological health. Because attitudes can affectbehaviors negatively, the authors undertook this study todetermine the implicit or unconscious attitudes of nursingand psychology students toward overweight individuals inmedical and non-medical contexts. Study participants in-cluded 90 students in upper division nursing and psychol-ogy programs at the University of Alaska Anchorage. Meanage was 25 years. The majority were white. Others reportedtheir race as Alaska Native or American Indian, AfricanAmerican, Asian, Hispanic, and Filipino. Attitudes weremeasured using an implicit association test (IAT) that meas-ures how readily a target concept and an attribute are as-sociated by analyzing reaction times. Participants sat atcomputers with dominant hand on response pad with thefollowing instructions: \"Please press the blue key as quickly as possible if you see a thin or normal weight person, or if you see a positive attribute used to describe a person. Please press the yellow key if you see an overweight per- son, or if you see a negative attribute used to describe a person.\" Attitudes were measured according to rapidity ofresponse time in relation to associating images of over-weight individuals with positive words and normal-weightor thin individuals with negative words (the inconsistentstereotype) as compared to associating positive words withthin or normal-weight individuals and negative words withobese or overweight individuals (the consistent stereotype).Scenarios exhibited individuals in both medical settings (patients) and non-medical settings. RESULTS OF THE STUDY : Students enrolled in a Social Psy- cholog y class analyzed the data for a class assignment. Re- sults indicated a statistically significant implicit bias toward overweight individuals by both the nursing students and thepsycholog y students. A stronger weight bias was noted when the target stimulus in the scenario was female rather thanmale. No significant differences in degree of bias towardweight were found between nursing and psychology stu-dents or between subjects in medical versus non-medicalsettings. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The authors sug- gest: \"Providing education and suppor t to overweight indi- viduals is central to nursing practice in a society struggling to manage obesity . Negative stereotypes or beliefs about these individuals may result in poor patient care. Therefore,nurses and other healthcare professionals must be awareof personal biases and work to develop methods to addressweight-related issues in a therapeutic manner.\" (p. 3504) BOX 31-5 QSEN TEACHING STRATEGY Assignment: Using Evidence to Address Clinical Problems Intervention With a Client Who Fears Gaining Weight (Anorexia Nervosa) Competency Domain: Evidence-Based Practice Learning Objectives: Student will: \u0081Differentiate clinical opinion from research and evidence summaries. \u0081Explain the role of evidence in determining the best clinical practice for intervening with clients who do not want to eat. \u0081Identify gaps between what is observed in the treatment setting to what has been identified as best practice. \u0081Discriminate between valid and invalid reasons for modifying evidence-based clinical practice based on clinical exper tise reasons. Continued4092_Ch31_646-668 24/07/14 5:32 PM Page 661Treatment Modalities The immediate aim of treatment in eating disorders is to restore the client's nutritional status. Complicationsof emaciation, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalancecan lead to death. Once the physical condition is nolonger life-threatening, other treatment modalitiesmay be initiated. Behavior Modification Efforts to change the maladaptive eating behaviors ofclients with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosahave become the widely accepted treatment. The im-portance of instituting a behavior modification pro-gram with these clients is to ensure that the programdoes not \"control\" them. Issues of control are centralto the etiology of these disorders, and in order for theprogram to be successful, the client must perceivethat he or she is in control of the treatment. Successes have been observed when the client with anorexia nervosa is allowed to contract for privilegesbased on weight gain. The client has input into thecare plan and can clearly see what the treatmentchoices are. The client has control over eating, over662 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation BOX 31-5 QSEN TEACHING STRATEGY\u2014cont'd \u0081Participate effectively in appropriate data collection and other research activities. \u0081Acknowledge own limitations in knowledge and clinical expertise before determining when to deviate from evidence-based best practices.

DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of three types of therapies intreatment of anorexia nervosa. Fifty-six women (age range:17 to 40 years) with anorexia nervosa were randomly as- signed to one of three treatments. Two were specializedpsychotherapies: cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) andinterpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). The third (the interven-tion) included treatment combining clinical managementand supportive psychotherapy (called nonspecific support-ive clinical management). They participated in 20 therapysessions over a minimum of 20 weeks. The interventionconsisted of education, care, and support, fostering a ther-apeutic relationship that promotes adherence to treatment.Emphasis was placed on resumption of normal eating andrestoration of weight. Information on weight maintenancestrategies, energy requirements, and relearning to eat nor-mally were included. Outcomes were measured on a globalanorexia nervosa measure using a 4-point ordinal scale: 4 = meets full criteria for the anorexia nervosa spectrum 3 = not full anorexia nervosa, but having a number of fea- tures of eating disorders 2 = few features of eating disorders1 = no significant features of eating disorders RESULTS OF THE STUDY: Of the participants who received nonspecific suppor tive clinical management, 5 6 percent re- ceived a score of 1 or 2 on the final outcome measure,Adapted from teaching strategy submitted by Pamela M. Ironside, Associate Professor, Indiana University School of Nursing, 662CHAPTER 31 Eating Disorders 663 the amount of exercise pursued, and even over whether or not to induce vomiting. Goals of therapy,along with the responsibilities of each for goalachievement, are agreed on by client and staff. Staff and client also agree on a system of rewards and privileges that can be earned by the client, whois given ultimate control. He or she has a choice ofwhether or not to abide by the contract\u2014a choice ofwhether or not to gain weight\u2014thereby either earn-ing the desired privilege or not. This method of treatment gives a great deal of autonomy to the client. It must be understood, how-ever, that these behavior modification techniques arehelpful for weight restoration only. Concomitant individual and/or family psychotherapy are requiredto prevent or reduce further morbidity. Some clinicians incorporate cognitive therapy con- cepts along with behavior modification techniques. Cog-nitive therapy helps the client to confront irrationalthinking and strive to modify distorted and maladaptivecognitions about body image and eating behaviors.Halmi (2008) states, \"Cognitive techniques such as cog-nitive restructuring and problem solving help the pa-tient deal with distorted and overvalued beliefs aboutfood and thinness and cope with life's stresses\" (p. 981). Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has also been shown to be helpful in treating clients with BED(Black & Andreasen, 2011; Wright, Thase, & Beck,2008). The therapy serves to help normalize behaviorby reducing the number of binging episodes. Somestudies have shown CBT to be most beneficial in re-ducing binging, but it has not been consistently help-ful in promoting weight loss in persons with BED(Wright et al., 2008). Individual Therapy Although individual psychotherapy is not the therapyof choice for eating disorders, it can be helpful whenunderlying psychological problems are contributingto the maladaptive behaviors. In supportive psy-chotherapy, the therapist encourages the client to ex-plore unresolved conflicts and to recognize themaladaptive eating behaviors as defense mechanismsused to ease the emotional pain. The goals are to re-solve the personal issues and establish more adaptivecoping strategies for dealing with stressful situations. Family Therapy Kirkpatrick and Caldwell (2004) state: Eating disorders have a profound effect on families. While these disorders can help bring families to-gether, they always cause some level of distress.Stresses can cause a breakdown of the whole familyunit if there isn't some form of intervention. Familytherapy aims at finding solutions to help the healingprocess for everyone in the family. (pp. 159-160) In many instances, eating disorders may be consid- ered family disorders, and resolution cannot be achieved until dynamics within the family have im- proved. Family therapy deals with education of themembers about the disorder's manifestations, possi-ble etiology, and prescribed treatment. Support isgiven to family members as they deal with feelings ofguilt associated with the perception that they mayhave contributed to the onset of the disorder. Supportis also given as they deal with the social stigma of hav-ing a family member with emotional problems. In some instances when the dysfunctional family dynamics are related to conflict avoidance, the familymay be noncompliant with therapy, as they attemptto maintain equilibrium by keeping a member in thesick role. When this occurs, it is essential to focus onthe functional operations within the family and tohelp them manage conflict and create change. Referrals are made to local support groups for fam- ilies of individuals with eating disorders. Resolutionand growth can sometimes be achieved through IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE\u2014 cont'd compared with 32 percent and 10 percent of those receiv- ing CBT and IPT, respectively. The authors suggest that IPTmay not have been as successful because of the lack ofsymptom focus and relatively long time taken to decide onthe problem area. They hypothesize that the CBT may havebeen less effective because of the large amount of psy-choeducational material and extensive skills acquisition associated with this therapy, and the difficulty of anorexiaclients to generate alternatives due to cognitive rigidity.These results were in direct opposition to the original hypothesis generated by the researchers in the beginningof the study.IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Nurses in advanced practice are usually trained to provide CB T and I PT. Often, generalist nurses do not have the theoretical background toperform these therapies. The interventions associated withnonspecific supportive clinical management are within thescope of nursing practice, and the results of this study indi-cate that they are superior to CBT and IPT in the treatmentof anorexia nervosa. Nurses could become instrumental inestablishing programs based on this type of treatment forindividuals with anorexia nervosa.4092_Ch31_646-668 24/07/14 5:32 PM Page 663interaction with others who are experiencing, or have experienced, the numerous problems of living with afamily member with an eating disorder. Psychopharmacology There are no medications specifically indicated for eat-ing disorders. Various medications have been prescribedfor associated symptoms such as anxiety and depression.Halmi (2008) reported on success with fluoxetine(Prozac) and clomipramine (Anafranil) in clients withanorexia with depressionor obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Cyproheptadine (Pe-riactin), in its unlabeled use as an appetite stimulant,and the antipsychotic chlorpromazine (Thorazine) havealso been used to treat this disorder in selected clients.Success has been reported in a controlled trial of olan-zapine (Zyprexa) in clients with anorexia nervosa (Bissada, Tasca, Barber, & Bradwejn, 2008). Fluoxetine (Prozac) has been found to be useful in the treatment of bulimia nervosa (Schatzberg, Cole, &DeBattista, 2010). A dosage of 60 mg/day (triple theusual antidepressant dosage) was found to be most ef-fective. It is possible that fluoxetine, an SSRI, may de-crease the craving for carbohydrates, thereby decreasingthe incidence of binge eating, which is often associatedwith consumption of large amounts of to be effective in controlled treatment studies(Halmi, 2008). One study was conducted with the anticonvulsant topiramate (Topamax) in the long-term treatment ofbinge-eating disorder with obesity (McElroy et al., 2007).Dosage was titrated to 400 mg/day (or the maximumtolerated dose). Participants experienced a significantdecline in mean weekly binge frequency and significantreduction in body weight. Nickel and associates (2005)also reported effective results with topiramate in clientswith bulimia nervosa. Episodes of binging and purgingwere decreased. Clients lost weight and reported a sig-nificant improvement in health-related quality of lifewhen compared with the placebo group.Fluoxetine has been successful in treating clients who are overweight, possibly for the same reason that was ex-plained for clients with bulimia. The effective dosage forpromoting weight loss is 60 mg/day. Regarding the useof anorexiants, Sadock and Sadock (2007) are used the treatment of obe- sity because of their anorexia-inducing effects. Be-cause tolerance develops for the anorectic effects andbecause of the drugs' high abuse potential, their usefor this indication is limited. (p. 1100) Withdrawal from anorexiants may result in a re- bound weight gain and, in some clients, a concomitant lethargy and depression. Two anorexiants that wereonce widely used, fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine,have been removed from the market because of theirassociation with serious heart and lung disease. Otheranorexiants currently on the market include phenter-mine, diethylpropion, benzphetamine, and phendime-trazine. All are indicated only for short-term weight loss. A medication for treating obesity, called sibutramine (Meridia), was approved by the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) in 1998. It was indicated onlyfor individuals who had a significant amount of weightto lose. The mechanism of action in the control of ap-petite appears to occur by inhibiting the neurotrans-mitters serotonin and norepinephrine. Some concernwas expressed about possible cardiovascular disease as-sociated with the use of sibutramine, and several deathshave been associated with its use by high-risk clients.Based on pressure from the FDA, the manufacturer is-sued a recall of the drug in October 2010. Two new weight-loss drugs were approved by the FDA in 2012. Lorcaserin (Belviq) suppresses the ap-petite by altering the hypothalamus, which is responsiblefor appetite metabolism. Qsymia is a combinedpreparation of phentermine and topiramate in a timed-release capsule. Phentermine is a CNS stimulant that isthought to suppress appetite by triggering release of theneurotransmitter norepinephrine. Topiramate is an an-ticonvulsant medication that has weight loss as a side ef-fect. It is also used in migraine prevention.664 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation CASE STUDY AND SAMPLE CARE PLAN NURSING HISTORY AND ASSESSMENT When Connie fainted in history class, she was taken to the university health center by her roommate, Nan. Nan toldthe nurse that Connie had been taking a lot of over-the-counter laxatives and diuretics. She also said that Connieoften self-induced vomiting when she felt that she hadeaten too much. After an initial physical assessment, thenurse in the university health center referred Connie to themental health clinic. At the mental health clinic, Connie weighed 110 lbs, and measured 5'6\" tall. She admitted to the psychiatric nurse, Kathy, that she tried to keep her weight down by dieting,but sometimes she got so hungry that she would overeat,and then she felt the need to self-induce vomiting to get rid 4092_Ch31_646-668 24/07/14 5:32 PM Page 664CHAPTER 31 Eating Disorders 665 Summary and Key Points The incidence of eating disorders has continued to increase since the middle of the 20th century. Individuals with anorexia nervosa, a disorder thatis characterized by a morbid fear of obesity and agross distortion of body image, literally can starvethemselves to death. The individual with anorexia nervosa believes he orshe is fat even when emaciated. The disorder iscommonly accompanied by depression and anxiety. Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterizedby the consumption of huge amounts of food, usu-ally in a short period of time, and often in secret.With bulimia nervosa, tension is relieved and pleas-ure felt during the time of the binge, but is soonfollowed by feelings of guilt and depression. Individuals with bulimia nervosa \"purge\" them-selves of the excessive intake with self-induced vom-iting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, orenemas. They also are subject to mood and anxietydisorders. Binge-eating disorder (BED) is characterized bythe consumption of huge amounts of food by anindividual who feels a lack of control over the eat-ing behavior. BED differs from bulimia nervosa inthat the individual does not engage in behaviors torid the body of the excess calories. CASE STUDY AND SAMPLE CARE PLAN \u2014cont'd of the calories. \"I really don't like doing it, but lots of the girls do. In fact, that is where I got the idea. I alwaysthought I was too fat in high school, but the competitionwasn't so great there. Here all the girls are so pretty . . .and so thin!! It's the only way I can keep my weightdown!!\" Connie admitted to Kathy that she hoards food in her dorm room and that she eats when she is feeling particu-larly anxious and depressed (often during the night). Sheadmitted to having eaten several bags of potato chips andwhole packages of cookies in a single sitting. She some-times drives to the local hamburger stand in the middleof the night, orders several hamburgers, fries, and milk-shakes, and consumes them as she sits in her car alone.She stated that she feels so much better while she is eat-ing these foods, but then feels panicky after they havebeen consumed. That is when she self-induces vomiting.\"Then I feel more depressed, and the only thing that helpsis eating! I feel so out of control!\" NURSING DIAGNOSES/OUTCOME IDENTIFICATION From the assessment data, the nurse develops the follow- ing nursing diagnosis for Connie:Ineffective coping related to feelings of helplessness, low self-esteem, and lack of control in life situation. Short-Term Goal: Client will identify and discuss fearsand anxieties with the nurse. Long-Term Goal: Client will identify adaptive copingstrategies that can be realistically incorporated into herlifestyle, thereby eliminating binging and purging in re-sponse to anxiety. PLANNING/IMPLEMENTATION INEFFECTIVE COPING The following nursing interventions have been identifiedfor Connie: Establish a trusting relationship with Connie. Be honestand accepting. Show unconditional positive regard.Help Connie identify the situations that produce anxietyand discuss how she coped with these situations beforeshe began binging and purging. Help Connie identify the emotions that precipitate binging(e.g., fear, boredom, anger, loneliness). Once these high-risk situations have been identified, helpher identify alternate behaviors, such as exercise, a hobby,or a warm bath. Encourage Connie to express feelings that have been sup-pressed because they were considered unacceptable.Help her identify healthier ways to express those feelings. Use role-play with Connie to deal with feelings and ex-periment with new behaviors. Explore the dynamics of Connie's family. Intrafamilial con-flicts reinforce maladaptive eating behaviors. Teach the concepts of good nutrition, and the importanceof healthy eating patterns in overall wellness. Consult with the physician about a prescription for fluox-etine for Connie. Help Connie find a support group for individuals with eat-ing disorders. Encourage regular attendance in this group. EVALUATION The outcome criteria for Connie have been met. She dis-cussed with the nurse the feelings that triggered bingingepisodes and the situations that precipitated those feelings.She has joined a support group of individuals with eatingdisorders and now has a \"buddy\" that she may call (evenin the middle of the night) when she is feeling like binging.She has started riding her bicycle regularly and goes to thefitness center when she is feeling especially anxious. Shestill sees the mental health nurse weekly and continues todiscuss her fears and anxieties. The urges to binge at stress-ful times have not disappeared completely. However, theyhave decreased in frequency, and Connie is now able tochoose more adaptive strategies for dealing with stress. 4092_Ch31_646-668 24/07/14 5:32 PM Page 665Compulsive eating can result in obesity, which is defined by the National Institutes of Health as abody mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater. Obesity predisposes the individual to many healthconcerns, and at the morbid level (a BMI of 40 orgreater), the weight alone can contribute to in-creases in morbidity and mortality. Predisposing factors to eating disorders include ge-netics, physiological factors, family dynamics, andenvironmental and lifestyle factors.Treatment modalities for eating disorders includebehavior modification, individual psychotherapy,cognitive-behavioral therapy, family therapy, andpsychopharmacology.666 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

She practiced endlessly before tryouts, but she was notselected. A week later, her boyfriend, Roy, broke up with her to dateanother girl. Janice, who was 5'3\" tall and weighed 110 pounds, decided it was because she was too fat. She began to exercise atevery possible moment. She skipped meals, and tried to keep herdaily consumption to no more than 300 calories. She lost a greatdeal of weight but became very weak. She felt cold all of the timeand wore sweaters in the warm weather. She collapsed during herphysical education class at school and was rushed to the emergencydepartment. On admission, she weighed 90 pounds. She was ema-ciated and anemic. The physician admitted her with a diagnosis ofanorexia nervosa.Answer the following questions about Janice: 1.What will be the primary consideration in her care? 2.How will treatment be directed toward helping her gain weight? 3.How will the nurse know if Janice is using self-induced vomit-ing to rid herself of food consumed at meals? 4092_Ch31_646-668 24/07/14 5:32 PM Page 667Institute of Medicine.

It was originally used to describe the theatri- cal mask worn by some dramatic actors at the time. Over the years, it lost its connotation of pretense andillusion and came to represent the person behind themask\u2014the \"real\" person. Personality traits may be defined as characteristics with which an individual is born or develops early inlife. They influence the way in which he or she per-ceives and relates to the environment and are quitestable over time. Personality disorders occur when these traits become rigid and inflexible and contribute tomaladaptive patterns of behavior or impairment infunctioning. Virtually all individuals exhibit some be-haviors associated with the various personality disor-ders from time to time. As previously stated, it is onlywhen significant functional impairment occurs in re-sponse to these personality characteristics that the in-dividual is thought to have a personality disorder. Personality development occurs in response to a number of biological and psychological influences.These variables include (but are not limited to) hered-ity, temperament, experiential learning, and social in-teraction. A number of theorists have attempted toprovide information about personality development.Most suggest that it occurs in an orderly, stepwise fash-ion. These stages overlap, however, as maturation oc-curs at different rates in different individuals. Thetheories of Sullivan (1953), Erikson (1963), andMahler (Mahler, Pine, & Bergman, 1975) were pre-sented at length in Chapter 3. The stages of personal-ity development according to these three theorists arecompared in Table 32-1. The nurse should understand\"normal\" personality development before learningabout what is considered maladaptive.670 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation CORE CONCEPT Personality The totality of emotional and behavioral characteristics that are particular to a specific person and that remainsomewhat stable and predictable over time.

Predispos- ing factors that have been implicated in the etiologyof personality disorders are presented. Symptomatol-ogy is explained to provide background knowledgefor assessing clients with personality disorders. Individuals with personality disorders are not often treated in acute care settings for the personalitydisorder as their primary psychiatric diagnosis. How-ever, many clients with other psychiatric and medicaldiagnoses manifest symptoms of personality disor-ders. Nurses are likely to encounter clients with thesepersonality characteristics frequently in all health-care settings. Nurses working in psychiatric settings are likely to encounter clients with borderline and antisocial per-sonality characteristics. The behavior of clients withborderline personality disorder is very unstable, andhospitalization is often required as a result of attemptsat self-injury. The client with antisocial personality disorder may enter the psychiatric arena as a result ofjudicially ordered evaluation. Psychiatric interventionmay be an alternative to imprisonment for antisocialbehavior if it is deemed potentially helpful. Nursing care of clients with borderline personality disorder or antisocial personality disorder is presentedin this chapter in the context of the nursing process.Various medical treatment modalities for personalitydisorders are explored. Historical Aspects The concept of a personality disorder has been de-scribed for thousands of years (Skodal & Gunderson,2008). In the fourth century BC, Hippocrates con- cluded that all disease stemmed from an excess of orimbalance among four bodily humors: yellow bile,black bile, blood, and phlegm. Hippocrates identifiedfour fundamental personality styles that he concludedstemmed from excesses in the four humors: the irri-table and hostile choleric (yellow bile); the pessimisticmelancholic (black bile); the overly optimistic and extraverted sanguine (blood); and the apatheticphlegmatic (phlegm). The medical profession first recognized that per- sonality disorders, apart from psychosis, were causefor their own special concern in 1801, with the recog-nition that an individual can behave irrationally evenwhen the powers of intellect are intact. Nineteenth-century psychiatrists embraced the term moral insanity, the concept of which defines what we know today aspersonality disorders. Historically, individuals with personality disorders have been labeled as \"bad\" or \"immoral\" and as de-viants in the range of normal personality dimensions.The events and sequences that result in pathology ofthe personality are complicated and difficult to un-ravel. Continued study is needed to facilitate under-standing of this complex behavioral phenomenon. A major difficulty for psychiatrists has been the es- tablishment of a classification of personality disorders.Ten specific types of personality disorders are identi-fied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of MentalDisorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). The APA has proposed acomplex diagnostic system to identify impairments inpersonality functioning specifically related to the dimensions of selfand interpersonal relations and to per- sonality trait domains and facets. This diagnostic system is very specific and addresses symptoms that may differ not only among personality disorders, but alsoamong individuals with the same personality disorder.This trait-specific diagnostic methodology is describedin the DSM-5 as an alternative approach to diagnosis of personality disorder, and is recommended for further study.CHAPTER 32 Personality Disorders 671 TABLE 32-1 Comparison of Personality Development\u2014Sullivan, Erikson, and Mahler\u2014cont'd MAJOR DEVELOPMENTAL TASKS AND DESIGNATED AGES SULLIVAN ERIKSON MAHLER 30 to 65 years: To achieve the life goals estab- lished for oneself , while also con- sidering the welfare of future generations. 65 years to death: To review one's life and derivemeaning from both positive andnegative events, while achieving apositive sense of self-worth.when it is out of sight; resolution ofseparation anxiety.4092_Ch32_669-702 24/07/14 5:33 PM Page 671The current diagnostic system classifies the person- ality disorders into three clusters according to descrip- tion of personality traits. These include the following: 1.Cluster A: Behaviors described as odd or eccentric. a. Paranoid personality disorderb. Schizoid personality disorder c. Schizotypal personality disorder 2.Cluster B: Behaviors described as dramatic, emo- tional, or erratic.a. Antisocial personality disorder b. Borderline personality disorder c. Histrionic personality disorder d. Narcissistic personality disorder 3.Cluster C: Behaviors described as anxious or fearful. a. Avoidant personality disorder b. Dependent personality disorderc. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder Types of Personality Disorders Paranoid Personality Disorder Definition and Epidemiological Statistics Skodol and Gunderson (2008) define paranoid per- sonality disorder as \"a pervasive, persistent, and inap- propriate mistrust of others. [Individuals with thisdisorder] are suspicious of others' motives and as-sume that others intend to exploit, harm, or deceivethem\" (p. 833). Prevalence of paranoid personalitydisorder has been estimated at 1 to 4 percent of thegeneral population, and it is often only diagnosedwhen the individual seeks treatment for a mood oranxiety disorder (Black & Andreasen, 2011). The dis-order is more commonly diagnosed in men than inwomen. Clinical Picture Individuals with paranoid personality disorder areconstantly on guard, hypervigilant, and ready for anyreal or imagined threat. They appear tense and irri-table. They have developed a hard exterior and be-come immune or insensitive to the feelings of others.They avoid interactions with other people, lest theybe forced to relinquish some of their own power.They always feel that others are there to take advan-tage of them. They are extremely oversensitive and tend to mis- interpret even minute cues within the environment,magnifying and distorting them into thoughts oftrickery and deception. Because they trust no one,they are constantly \"testing\" the honesty of others.Their intimidating manner provokes exasperationand anger in almost everyone with whom they comein contact. Individuals with paranoid personality disorder main- tain their self-esteem by attributing their shortcomingsto others. They do not accept responsibility for theirown behaviors and feelings and project this responsi-bility on to others. They are envious and hostile towardothers who are highly successful and believe the onlyreason they are not as successful is because they havebeen treated unfairly. People who are paranoid are ex-tremely vulnerable and constantly on the defensive. Anyreal or imagined threat can release hostility and angerthat is fueled by animosities from the past. The desirefor reprisal and vindication is so intense that a possibleloss of control can result in aggression and violence.These outbursts are usually brief, and the paranoid per-son soon regains the external control, rationalizes thebehavior, and reconstructs the defenses central to hisor her personality pattern. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for paranoid person- ality disorder are presented in Box 32-1. Predisposing Factors Research has indicated a possible hereditary link inparanoid personality disorder. Studies have revealeda higher incidence of paranoid personality disorder672 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation BOX 32-1 Diagnostic Criteria for Paranoid Personality Disorder A. A pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others such that their motives are interpreted as malevolent, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the following: 1. Suspects, without sufficient basis, that others are exploiting, harming, or deceiving him or her 2. Is preoccupied with unjustified doubts about the loyalty or trustworthiness of friends or associates 3. Is reluctant to confide in others because of unwarranted fear that the information will be used maliciously against him or her 4. Reads hidden demeaning or threatening meanings into benign remarks or events 5. Persistently bears grudges (i.e., is unforgiving of insults, injuries, or slights) 6. Perceives attacks on his or her character or reputation that are not apparent to others and is quick to react angrily or to counterattack 7. Has recurrent suspicions, without justification, regarding fidelity of spouse or sexual partner B. Does not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar disorder or depressive disorder with psychotic features, or another psychotic disorder and is not attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition.

Psychosocially, people with paranoid personality disorder may have been subjected to parental antag-onism and harassment. They likely served as scape-goats for displaced parental aggression and graduallyrelinquished all hope of affection and approval. Theylearned to perceive the world as harsh and unkind, aplace calling for protective vigilance and mistrust.They entered the world with a \"chip-on-the-shoulder\"attitude and were met with many rebuffs and rejec-tions from others. Anticipating humiliation and be-trayal by others, the paranoid person learned toattack first. Schizoid Personality Disorder Definition and Epidemiological Statistics Schizoid personality disorder is characterized prima- rily by a profound defect in the ability to form per-sonal relationships or to respond to others in anymeaningful way (Black & Andreasen, 2011). These in-dividuals display a lifelong pattern of social with-drawal, and their discomfort with human interactionis apparent. The prevalence of schizoid personalitydisorder within the general population has been esti-mated at between 3 and 7.5 percent. Significant num-bers of people with the disorder are never observedin a clinical setting. Gender ratio of the disorder isunknown, although it is diagnosed more frequentlyin men. Clinical Picture People with schizoid personality disorder appearcold, aloof, and indifferent to others. They prefer towork in isolation and are unsociable, with little needor desire for emotional ties. They are able to investenormous affective energy in intellectual pursuits. In the presence of others they appear shy, anxious, or uneasy. They are inappropriately serious abouteverything and have difficulty acting in a lightheartedmanner. Their behavior and conversation exhibit lit-tle or no spontaneity. Typically they are unable to ex-perience pleasure, and their affect is commonly blandand constricted. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for schizoid person- ality disorder are presented in Box 32-2. Predisposing Factors Although the role of heredity in the etiology ofschizoid personality disorder is unclear, the feature ofintroversion appears to be a highly inheritable char-acteristic. Further studies are required before defini-tive statements can be made. Psychosocially, the development of schizoid per- sonality is probably influenced by early interactionalpatterns that the person found to be cold and unsat-isfying. The childhoods of these individuals haveoften been characterized as bleak, cold, and notablylacking empathy and nurturing. A child brought upwith this type of parenting may become a schizoidadult if that child possesses a temperamental disposi-tion that is shy, anxious, and introverted. Skodol andGunderson (2008) state: Clinicians have noted that schizoid personality disor- der occurs in adults who experienced cold, neglect-ful, and ungratifying relationships in early childhood,which leads these persons to assume that relation-ships are not valuable or worth pursuing. (p. 836) Schizotypal Personality Disorder Definition and Epidemiological Statistics Individuals with schizotypal personality disorder were once described as \"latent schizophrenics.\" Their be- havior is odd and eccentric but does not decompen-sate to the level of schizophrenia. Schizotypalpersonality is a graver form of the pathologically lesssevere schizoid personality pattern. Studies indicateCHAPTER 32 Personality Disorders 673 BOX 32-2 Diagnostic Criteria for Schizoid Personality Disorder A. A pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of expression of emotions in inter- personal settings, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the following: 1. Neither desires nor enjoys close relationships, including being part of a family 2. Almost always chooses solitary activities 3. Has little, if any, interest in having sexual experiences with another person 4. Takes pleasure in few, if any, activities 5. Lacks close friends or confidants other than first-degree relatives 6. Appears indifferent to the praise or criticism of others 7. Shows emotional coldness, detachment, or flattened affectivity B. Does not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar disorder or depressive disorder with psychotic features, another psychotic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder and is not attributable to the physiological effects ofanother medical condition.

Clinical Picture Individuals with schizotypal personality disorder arealoof and isolated and behave in a bland and apa-thetic manner. Magical thinking, ideas of reference,illusions, and depersonalization are part of theireveryday world. Examples include superstitiousness;belief in clairvoyance, telepathy, or a \"sixth sense\";and beliefs that \"others can feel my feelings.\" The speech pattern is sometimes bizarre. People with this disorder often cannot orient their thoughtslogically and become lost in personal irrelevancies andin tangential asides that seem vague, digressive, andnot pertinent to the topic at hand. This feature of theirpersonality only further alienates them from others. Under stress, these individuals may decompensate and demonstrate psychotic symptoms, such as delusionalthoughts, hallucinations, or bizarre behaviors, but theyare usually of brief duration (Sadock & Sadock, 2007).They often talk or gesture to themselves, as if \"living intheir own world.\" Their affect is bland or inappropriate,such as laughing at their own problems or at a situationthat most people would consider sad. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for schizotypal per- sonality disorder are presented in Box 32-3. Predisposing Factors Evidence suggests that schizotypal personality disorderis more common among the first-degree biological rel-atives of people with schizophrenia than among thegeneral population. It is now considered as part of thegenetic spectrum of schizophrenia (APA, 2013). Although speculative, other biogenic factors that maycontribute to the development of this disorder includeanatomical deficits or neurochemical dysfunctions re-sulting in diminished activation, minimal pleasure-pain sensibilities, and impaired cognitive functions.These biological etiological factors support the closelink between schizotypal personality disorder andschizophrenia and were considered when classifyingschizotypal personality disorder with schizophreniarather than with the personality disorders in the Inter-national Classification of Diseases (ICD -10)(Skodol & Gunderson, 2008). The early family dynamics of the individual with schizotypal personality disorder may have been char-acterized by indifference, impassivity, or formality,leading to a pattern of discomfort with personal affec-tion and closeness. Early on, affective deficits madethem unattractive and unrewarding social compan-ions. They were likely shunned, overlooked, rejected,and humiliated by others, resulting in feelings of lowself-esteem and a marked distrust of interpersonal re-lations. Having failed repeatedly to cope with these ad-versities, they began to withdraw and reduce contactwith individuals and situations that evoked sadnessand humiliation. Their new inner world providedthem with a more significant and potentially reward-ing existence than the one experienced in reality. Antisocial Personality Disorder Definition and Epidemiological Statistics Antisocial personality disorder is a pattern of socially irresponsible, exploitative, and guiltless behavior thatreflects a general disregard for the rights of others.These individuals exploit and manipulate others forpersonal gain and are unconcerned with obeying the law. They have difficulty sustaining consistent employment and in developing stable relationships.674 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation BOX 32-3 Diagnostic Criteria for Schizotypal Personality Disorder A. A pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits marked by acute discomfort with, and reduced capacity for, close relationships as well as by cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentricities of behavior, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following: 1. Ideas of reference (excluding delusions of reference) 2. Odd beliefs or magical thinking that influences behavior and is inconsistent with subcultural norms (e.g., superstitious - ness, belief in clairvoyance, telepathy, or \"sixth sense;\" in children and adolescents, bizarre fantasies or preoccupations) 3. Unusual perceptual experiences, including bodily illusions 4. Odd thinking and speech (e.g., vague, circumstantial, metaphorical, overelaborate, or stereotyped) 5. Suspiciousness or paranoid ideation 6. Inappropriate or constricted affect 7. Behavior or appearance that is odd, eccentric, or peculiar 8. Lack of close friends or confidants other than first-degree relatives 9. Excessive social anxiety that does not diminish with familiarity and tends to be associated with paranoid fears rather than negative judgments about self B. Does not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar disorder or depressive disorder with psychotic features, another psychotic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder.

In the United States, prevalence estimates range from 2 to 4 percent in men to about 1 percentin women (Black & Andreasen, 2011). The disorderis more common among the lower socioeconomicclasses, particularly so among highly mobile inhabi-tants of impoverished urban areas. The ICD -10iden- tifies this disorder as dissocial personality disorder. NOTE: The clinical picture, predisposing factors, nursing diagnoses, and interventions for care ofclients with antisocial personality disorder are pre-sented later in this chapter. Borderline Personality Disorder Definition and Epidemiological Statistics Borderline personality disorder is characterized by a pat- tern of intense and chaotic relationships, with affectiveinstability and fluctuating attitudes toward other people.These individuals are impulsive, are directly and indi-rectly self-destructive, and lack a clear sense of identity.Prevalence of borderline personality is estimated at 1 to2 percent of the population. It is more common inwomen than in men, with femal e-to-male ratios being es- timated as high as 4 to 1 (Lubit, 2011). The ICD- 10iden- tifies this disorder as emotionally unstable personality disorder. NOTE: The clinical picture, predisposing factors, nursing diagnoses, and interventions for care ofclients with borderline personality disorder arepresented later in this chapter. Histrionic Personality Disorder Definition and Epidemiological Statistics Histrionic personality disorder is characterized by color- ful, dramatic, and extroverted behavior in excitable,emotional people. They have difficulty maintaining long-lasting relationships, although they require constant affirmation of approval and acceptance from others.Prevalence of the disorder is thought to be about 2 to 3percent, and it is more common in women than in men. Clinical Picture People with histrionic personality disorder tend to beself-dramatizing, attention seeking, overly gregarious,and seductive. They use manipulative and exhibitionis-tic behaviors in their demands to be the center of at-tention. People with histrionic personality disorderoften demonstrate, in mild pathological form, what oursociety tends to foster and admire in its members: to bewell liked, successful, popular, extroverted, attractive,and sociable. However, beneath these surface charac-teristics is a driven quality\u2014an all-consuming need forapproval and a desperate striving to be conspicuous andto evoke affection or attract attention at all costs. Failureto evoke the attention and approval they seek often re-sults in feelings of dejection and anxiety. Individuals with this disorder are highly distractible and flighty by nature. They have difficulty paying at-tention to detail. They can portray themselves as care-free and sophisticated on the one hand and asinhibited and naive on the other. They tend to behighly suggestible, impressionable, and easily influ-enced by others. They are strongly dependent. Interpersonal relationships are fleeting and superfi- cial. The person with histrionic personality disorder,having failed throughout life to develop the richness ofinner feelings and lacking resources from which todraw, lacks the ability to provide another with genuinelysustained affection. Somatic complaints are not uncom-mon in these individuals, and fleeting episodes of psy-chosis may occur during periods of extreme stress. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for histrionic per- sonality disorder are presented in Box 32-4. Predisposing Factors Neurobiological correlates have been proposed in the predisposition to histrionic personality disorder.Coccaro and Siever (2000) relate the characteristics of CHAPTER 32 Personality Disorders 675 BOX 32-4 Diagnostic Criteria for Histrionic Personality Disorder A pervasive pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:1.

Displays rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotions.4. Consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to self.5. Has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail.6. Shows self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of emotion. 7.

They sug-gested that the trait of impulsivity may be associated withdecreased serotonergic activity. Heredity also may be a factor because the disorder is apparently more common among first-degree bio-logical relatives of people with the disorder than in thegeneral population. Skodol and Gunderson (2008) report on research that suggests that the behavioralcharacteristics of histrionic personality disorder maybe associated with a biogenetically determined tem-perament. From this perspective, histrionic personal-ity disorder would arise out of \"an extreme variationof temperamental disposition\" (p. 844). From a psychosocial perspective, learning experi- ences may contribute to the development of histrionicpersonality disorder. The child may have learned thatpositive reinforcement was contingent on the ability toperform parentally approved and admired behaviors.It is likely that the child rarely received either positiveor negative feedback. Parental acceptance and ap-proval came inconsistently and only when the behav-iors met parental expectations. Millon (2004) states: Because nothing they do works consistently, such chil- dren experience frustration in getting their parents' at-tention and exaggerate behaviors basic to their genderstereotype to secure compliments and affection. Oth-erwise, they are ignored. Such children enter adoles-cence with a nearly insatiable thirst for attention andlove. (p. 314) Narcissistic Personality Disorder Definition and Epidemiological Statistics Persons with narcissistic personality disorder have an exaggerated sense of self-worth. They lack empathy, and are hypersensitive to the evaluation of others.They believe that they have the inalienable right to re-ceive special consideration and that their desire is suf-ficient justification for possessing whatever they seek. This diagnosis appeared for the first time in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. However, the concept of narcissism has its rootsin the 19th century. It was viewed by early psychoanalystsas a normal phase of psychosexual development. Theprevalence of narcissistic personality disorder is esti-mated at about 6 percent (Black & Andreasen, 2011). Itis diagnosed more often in men than in women. Clinical Picture Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder ap-pear to lack humility, being overly self-centered andexploiting others to fulfill their own desires. Theyoften do not conceive of their behavior as being in-appropriate or objectionable. Because they viewthemselves as \"superior\" beings, they believe they areentitled to special rights and privileges. Although often grounded in grandiose distortions of reality, their mood is usually optimistic, relaxed,cheerful, and carefree. This mood can easily change,however, because of their fragile self-esteem. If theydo not meet self-expectations, do not receive the pos-itive feedback they expect from others, or draw criti-cism from others, they may respond with rage, shame,humiliation, or dejection. They may turn inward andfantasize rationalizations that convince them of theircontinued stature and perfection. The exploitation of others for self-gratification re- sults in impaired interpersonal relationships. In se-lecting a mate, narcissistic individuals frequentlychoose a person who will provide them with the praiseand positive feedback that they require and who willnot ask much from their partner in return. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for narcissistic per- sonality disorder are presented in Box 32-5.676 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation BOX 32-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder A pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), need for admiration, and lack of empathy, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:1. Has a grandiose sense of self-importance (e.g., exaggerates achievements and talents, expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements). 2. Is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love.3. Believes that he or she is \"special\" and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions). 4. Requires excessive admiration.5. Has a sense of entitlement (i.e., unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectations). 6. Is interpersonally exploitative (i.e., takes advantage of others to achieve his or her own ends). 7. Lacks empathy: is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others. 8. Is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or her.9. Shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes.

American Psychiatric Association.4092_Ch32_669-702 24/07/14 5:33 PM Page 676Predisposing Factors Several psychodynamic theories exist regarding the pre- disposition to narcissistic personality disorder. Skodoland Gunderson (2008) suggest that, as children, theseindividuals had their fears, failures, or dependencyneeds responded to with criticism, disdain, or neglect.They grow up with contempt for these behaviors inthemselves and others and are unable to view others assources of comfort and support. They project an imageof invulnerability and self-sufficiency that conceals theirtrue sense of emptiness and contributes to their inabil-ity to feel deeply. Martinez-Lewi (2008) suggests that the parents of individuals with narcissistic personality disorder wereoften narcissistic themselves. The parents were de-manding, perfectionistic, and critical, and they placedunrealistic expectations on the child. Children modeltheir parents' behavior, giving way to the adult narcis-sist. Some clinicians have suggested that the parentsmay have subjected the child to physical or emotionalabuse or neglect. Narcissism may also develop from an environment in which parents attempt to live their lives vicariouslythrough their child. They expect the child to achievethe things they did not achieve, possess that whichthey did not possess, and have life better and easierthan they did. The child is not subjected to the re-quirements and restrictions that may have dominatedthe parents' lives, and thereby grows up believing heor she is above that which is required for everyoneelse. Bosson and Prewitt-Freilino (2007) state: Some parents pamper and indulge their youngsters in ways that teach them that their every wish is a command,that they can receive without giving in return, and thatthey deserve prominence without even minimal effort.Consequently, these youngsters learn to associate the selfwith positive affect and develop extremely favorable im-plicit self-representations. [However, because] the worldbeyond home will not be so benign and accepting, inmany cases of parental overindulgence, reality eventuallyintervenes\u2014in the form of personal failures, humiliations,weaknesses, and the like\u2014and undermines the individ-ual's explicit self-esteem. From this perspective, narcissists'tendencies toward entitlement and exploitativeness reflectthe overblown implicit expectations their parents instilledin them, while their shame-proneness reflects theirchronic perception of themselves as falling short of theseexpectations. (p. 414) Avoidant Personality Disorder Definition and Epidemiological Statistics The individual with avoidant personality disorder is extremely sensitive to rejection and because of this may lead a very socially withdrawn life. It is not thathe or she is asocial; in fact, there may be a strong de-sire for companionship. The extreme shyness andfear of rejection, however, create needs for unusuallystrong assurances of unconditional acceptance. Preva-lence of the disorder in the general population isabout 2.4 percent, and it appears to be equally com-mon in men and women (APA, 2013). Clinical Picture Individuals with this disorder are awkward and uncom-fortable in social situations. From a distance, othersmay perceive them as timid, withdrawn, or perhapscold and strange. Those who have closer relationshipswith them, however, soon learn of their sensitivities,touchiness, evasiveness, and mistrustful qualities. Their speech is usually slow and constrained, with frequent hesitations, fragmentary thought se-quences, and occasional confused and irrelevant di-gressions. They are often lonely, and express feelingsof being unwanted. They view others as critical, be-traying, and humiliating. They desire to have closerelationships but avoid them because of their fear ofbeing rejected. Depression, anxiety, and anger atoneself for failing to develop social relations are com-monly experienced. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for avoidant person- ality disorder are presented in Box 32-6.CHAPTER 32 Personality Disorders 677 BOX 32-6 Diagnostic Criteria for Avoidant Personality Disorder A pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation, beginning by ear ly adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the following: 1.

Is unwilling to get involved with people unless certain of being liked.3. Shows restraint within intimate relationships because of the fear of being shamed or ridiculed.4. Is preoccupied with being criticized or rejected in social situations.5. Is inhibited in new interpersonal situations because of feelings of inadequacy.6. Views self as socially inept, personally unappealing, or inferior to others. 7. Is unusually reluctant to take personal risks or to engage in any new activities because they may prove embarrassing.

American Psychiatric Association.4092_Ch32_669-702 24/07/14 5:33 PM Page 677Predisposing Factors There is no clear cause of avoidant personality disorder. Contributing factors are most likely a combination ofbiological, genetic, and psychosocial influences. Someinfants who exhibit traits of hyperirritability, crankiness,tension, and withdrawal behaviors may possess a tem-peramental disposition toward an avoidant pattern. The primary psychosocial predisposing influence to avoidant personality disorder is parental rejectionand censure, which is often reinforced by peers (Millon,2004). These children are often reared in families inwhich they are belittled, abandoned, and criticized,such that any natural optimism is extinguished andreplaced with feelings of low self-worth and socialalienation. They learn to be suspicious and to view theworld as hostile and dangerous. Dependent Personality Disorder Definition and Epidemiological Statistics Dependent personality disorder is characterized by \"a pattern of relying excessively on others for emotionalsupport\" (Black & Andreasen, 2011, p. 312). Thismode of behavior is evident in the tendency to allowothers to make decisions, to feel helpless when alone,to act submissively, to subordinate needs to others, totolerate mistreatment by others, to demean oneself togain acceptance, and to fail to function adequately insituations that require assertive or dominant behavior. The disorder is relatively common. Sadock and Sadock (2007) discuss the results of one study of per-sonality disorders in which 2.5 percent of the samplewere diagnosed with dependent personality disorder.It is more common in women than in men and morecommon in the youngest children of a family.Clinical Picture Individuals with dependent personality disorder have anotable lack of self-confidence that is often apparent intheir posture, voice, and mannerisms. They are typicallypassive and acquiescent to the desires of others. Theyare overly generous and thoughtful and underplay theirown attractiveness and achievements. They may appearto others to \"see the world through rose-coloredglasses,\" but when alone, they may feel pessimistic, dis-couraged, and dejected. Others are not made aware ofthese feelings; their \"suffering\" is done in silence. Individuals with dependent personality disorder as- sume the passive and submissive role in relationships.They are willing to let others make their important de-cisions. Should the dependent relationship end, theyfeel fearful and vulnerable because they lack confi-dence in their ability to care for themselves. They mayhastily and indiscriminately attempt to establish anotherrelationship with someone they believe can providethem with the nurturance and guidance they need. They avoid positions of responsibility and become anxious when forced into them. They have feelings oflow self-worth and are easily hurt by criticism and disap-proval. They will do almost anything, even if it is unpleas-ant or demeaning, to earn the acceptance of others. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for dependent per- sonality disorder are presented in Box 32-7. Predisposing Factors An infant may be genetically predisposed to a de-pendent temperament. Twin studies measuring sub-missiveness have shown a higher correlation betweenidentical twins than fraternal twins. Psychosocially, dependency is fostered in infancy when stimulation and nurturance are experienced 678 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation BOX 32-7 Diagnostic Criteria for Dependent Personality Disorder A pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of that leads to submissive and clinging behavior and fears of separation, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following: 1. Has difficulty making everyday decisions without an excessive amount of advice and reassurance from others. 2. Needs others to assume responsibility for most major areas of his or her life.3. Has difficulty expressing disagreement with others because of fear of loss of support or approval. ( Note: Do not include realistic fears of retribution.) 4. Has difficulty initiating projects or doing things on his or her own (because of a lack of self-confidence in judgment or abilities rather than a lack of motivation or energy). 5. Goes to excessive lengths to obtain nurturance and support from others, to the point of volunteering to do things that are unpleasant. 6. Feels uncomfortable or helpless when alone because of exaggerated fears of being unable to care for himself or herself. 7. Urgently seeks another relationship as a source of care and support when a close relationship ends. 8. Is unrealistically preoccupied with fears of being left to take care of himself or herself.

Ifthis exclusive attachment continues as the childgrows, the dependency is nurtured. A problem mayarise when parents become overprotective and dis-courage independent behaviors on the part of thechild. Parents who make new experiences unneces-sarily easy for the child and refuse to allow him or herto learn by experience encourage their child to giveup efforts at achieving autonomy. Dependent behav-iors may be subtly rewarded in this environment, andthe child may come to fear a loss of love or attach-ment from the parental figure if independent behav-iors are attempted. Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder Definition and Epidemiological Statistics Individuals with obsessive-compulsive personality dis- order are very serious and formal and have difficulty expressing emotions. They are overly disciplined, per-fectionistic, and preoccupied with rules. They are in-flexible about the way in which things must be doneand have a devotion to productivity to the exclusionof personal pleasure. An intense fear of making mis-takes leads to difficulty with decision-making. The dis-order is relatively common and occurs more often inmen than in women. Within the family constellation,it appears to be most common in oldest children. Clinical Picture Individuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disor-der are inflexible and lack spontaneity. They are metic-ulous and work diligently and patiently at tasks thatrequire accuracy and discipline. They are especiallyconcerned with matters of organization and efficiencyand tend to be rigid and unbending about rules andprocedures. Social behavior tends to be polite and formal. They are very \"rank conscious,\" a characteristic that is re-flected in their contrasting behaviors with \"superiors\"as opposed to \"inferiors.\" They tend to be very solici-tous to and ingratiating with authority figures. Withsubordinates, however, the compulsive person can be-come quite autocratic and condemnatory, often ap-pearing pompous and self-righteous. with der typify the \"bureaucratic the so-calledcompany man. They see themselves as conscientious,loyal, dependable, and responsible, and are contemp-tuous of people whose behavior they consider frivo-lous and impulsive. Emotional behavior is consideredimmature and irresponsible. Although on the surface these individuals appear to be calm and controlled, underneath this exteriorlies a great deal of ambivalence, conflict, and hostility.Individuals with this disorder commonly use the de-fense mechanism of reaction formation. Not daringto expose their true feelings of defiance and anger,they withhold these feelings so strongly that the op-posite feelings come forth. The defenses of isolation,intellectualization, rationalization, and undoing arealso commonly evident. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for obsessive-compul- sive personality disorder are presented in Box 32-8.

These parents expect their children to live up to their imposed stan-dards of conduct and condemn them if they do not.Praise for positive behaviors is bestowed on the childwith much less frequency than punishment for undesir-able behaviors. In this environment, individuals becomeexperts in learning what they must notdo to avoid pun- ishment and condemnation rather than what they can do to achieve attention and praise. They learn to heedrigid restrictions and rules. Positive achievements are expected, taken for granted, and only occasionally ac-knowledged by their parents, whose comments andjudgments are limited to pointing out transgressionsand infractions of rules. Application of the Nursing Process Borderline Personality Disorder (Background Assessment Data) Historically, there have been a group of clients who did not classically conform to the standard categories ofneuroses or psychoses. The designation \"borderline\"was introduced to identify these clients who seemed tofall on the border between the two categories. Otherterminology that has been used in an attempt to iden-tify this disorder includes ambulatory schizophrenia, pseudoneurotic schizophrenia, and emotionally unstable personality. When the term borderline was first proposed for inclusion in the third edition of the DSM, some psy-chiatrists feared it might be used as a \"wastebasket\" di-agnosis for difficult-to-treat clients. However, a specificset of criteria has been established for diagnosing whathas been described as \"a consistent and stable courseof unstable behavior\" (Box 32-9).Clinical Picture Individuals with borderline personality always seem tobe in a state of crisis. Their affect is one of extreme in-tensity, and their behavior reflects frequent change-ability. These changes can occur within days, hours, oreven minutes. Often these individuals exhibit a single,dominant affective tone, such as depression, whichmay give way periodically to anxious agitation or inap-propriate outbursts of anger. Chronic Depression Depression is so common in clients with this disorderthat before the inclusion of borderline personality dis-order in the DSM, many of these clients were diagnosed with depressive disorder. Depression occurs in responseto feelings of abandonment by the mother in earlychildhood (see \"Predisposing Factors\"). Underlying thedepression is a sense of rage that is sporadically turnedinward on the self and externally on the environment.Seldom is the individual aware of the true source ofthese feelings until well into long-term therapy. Inability to Be Alone Because of this chronic fear of abandonment, clientswith borderline personality disorder have little toler-ance for being alone. They prefer a frantic search forcompanionship, no matter how unsatisfactory, to sit-ting with feelings of loneliness, emptiness, and bore-dom (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Patterns of Interaction Clinging and Distancing The client with borderline personality disorder com-monly exhibits a pattern of interaction with others thatis characterized by clinging and distancing behaviors.680 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation BOX 32-9 Diagnostic Criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder A pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:1. Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. ( Note: Do not include suicidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in criterion 5.) 2. A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealiza- tion and devaluation. 3. Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self.4. Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving , binge eating). ( Note: Do not include suicidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in criterion 5.) 5. Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating behavior.6. Affective instability due to marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety, usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days). 7. Chronic feelings of emptiness. 8. Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights). 9. Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms. Reprinted with permission from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (Copyright 2013). American Psychiatric Association.4092_Ch32_669-702 24/07/14 5:33 PM Page 680When clients are clinging to another individual, they may exhibit helpless, dependent, or even childlike be-haviors. They overidealize a single individual withwhom they want to spend all their time, with whomthey express a frequent need to talk, or from whomthey seek constant reassurance. Acting-out behaviors,even self-mutilation, may result when they cannot bewith this chosen individual. Distancing behaviors arecharacterized by hostility, anger, and devaluation ofothers, arising from a feeling of discomfort with close-ness. Distancing behaviors also occur in response toseparations, confrontations, or attempts to limit cer-tain behaviors. Devaluation of others is manifested bydiscrediting or undermining their strengths and per-sonal significance. Splitting Splitting is a primitive ego defense mechanism that is common in people with borderline personality disor-der. It arises from their lack of achievement of object constancy and is manifested by an inability to inte- grate and accept both positive and negative feelings.In their view, people\u2014including themselves\u2014and lifesituations are either all good or all bad. For example,if a caregiver is nurturing and supportive, he or sheis lovingly idealized. Should the nurturing relation-ship be threatened in any way (e.g., the caregivermust move because of his or her job), suddenly theindividual is devalued, and the idealized imagechanges from beneficent caregiver to one of hatefuland cruel persecutor. Manipulation In their efforts to prevent the separation they so des-perately fear, clients with this disorder become mas-ters of manipulation. Virtually any behavior becomesan acceptable means of achieving the desired result:relief from separation anxiety. Playing one individualagainst another is a common ploy to allay these fearsof abandonment. Self-Destructive Behaviors Repetitive, self-mutilative behaviors are classic mani-festations of borderline personality disorder. Althoughthese acts can be fatal, most commonly they are ma-nipulative gestures designed to elicit a rescue responsefrom significant others. Suicide attempts are quitecommon and often result from feelings of abandon-ment following separation from a significant other.The endeavor is commonly attempted, however, incor-porating a measure of \"safety\" into the plan (e.g., swal-lowing pills in an area where the person will surely bediscovered by others; or swallowing pills and makinga phone call to report the deed to someone). Other types of destructive behaviors include cutting, scratching, and burning. Various theories abound re-garding why these individuals are able to inflict pain onthemselves. One hypothesis suggests they may havehigher levels of endorphins in their bodies than mostpeople, thereby increasing their threshold for pain. An-other theory relates to the individual's personal identitydisturbance. It proposes that since many of the self-mutilating behaviors take place when the individual isin a state of depersonalization and derealization, he orshe does not initially feel the pain. The mutilation continues until pain is felt in an attempt to counteractthe feelings of unreality. Some clients with borderlinepersonality disorder have reported that \"to feel pain is better than to feel nothing.\" The pain validates theirexistence. Impulsivity Individuals with borderline personality disorder havepoor impulse control based on primary process func-tioning. Impulsive behaviors associated with border-line personality disorder include substance abuse,gambling, promiscuity, reckless driving, and bingingand purging. Many times these acting-out behaviorsoccur in response to real or perceived feelings ofabandonment. Predisposing Factors to Borderline Personality Disorder Biological Influences Biochemical Cummings and Mega (2003) have sug- gested a possible serotonergic defect in clients with borderline personality disorder . In positron emission tomography using /H9251 -[11C] methyl-L-tryptophan (/H9251-[11C]MTrp), synthesis clients borderline personality demon- strated significantly decreased /H9251-[11C]MTrp in medial frontal, superior temporal, and striatal regions of thebrain. Cummings and Mega (2003) state: These functional imaging studies support a medial and orbitofrontal abnormality that may promote theimpulsive aggression demonstrated by patients withthe borderline personality disorder. (p. 230) Genetic The decrease in serotonin also may have ge- netic implications for borderline personality disorder. Sadock and Sadock (2007) report that depression is common in the family backgrounds of clients withborderline personality disorder . They state: These patients have more relatives with mood disor- ders than do control groups, and persons with bor-derline personality disorder often have mooddisorder as well. (p. 791) Psychosocial Influences Childhood Trauma Studies have shown that many in- dividuals with borderline personality disorder werereared in families with chaotic environments. LubitCHAPTER 32 Personality Disorders 6814092_Ch32_669-702 24/07/14 5:33 PM Page 681(2011) states, \"Risk factors [for borderline personality disorder] include family environments characterizedby trauma, neglect, and/or separation; exposure tosexual and physical abuse; and serious parental psy-chopathology, such as substance abuse and antisocialpersonality disorder.\" Seventy percent of borderlinepersonality disorder clients report a history of physical and/or sexual abuse (Gunderson, 2011). Insome instances, this disorder has been likened to post-traumatic stress disorder in response to childhoodtrauma and abuse. Oldham and associates (2006)have stated: Even when full criteria for comorbid PTSD are not present, patients with borderline personality disordermay experience PTSD-like symptoms. For example,symptoms such as intrusion, avoidance, and hyper-arousal may emerge during psychotherapy. Aware-ness of the trauma-related nature of these symptomscan facilitate both psychotherapeutic and pharmaco-logical efforts in symptom relief. (p. 1267) Developmental Factors Theory of Object Relations According to Mahler's theory of object relations (Mahler et al., 1975), the infant passesthrough six phases from birth to 36 months, when asense of separateness from the parenting figure is finallyestablished. These phases include the following: Phase 1 (Birth to 1 Month), Autistic Phase. During this period, the baby spends most of his or her timein a half-waking, half-sleeping state. The main goalis fulfillment of needs for survival and comfort. Phase 2 (1 to 5 Months), Symbiotic Phase. At this time, there is a type of psychic fusion of mother andchild. The child views the self as an extension of theparenting figure, although there is a developingawareness of external sources of need fulfillment. Phase 3 (5 to 10 Months), Differentiation Phase. The child is beginning to recognize that there is a sepa-rateness between the self and the parenting figure. Phase 4 (10 to 16 Months), Practicing Phase. This phase is characterized by increased locomotorfunctioning and the ability to explore the environ-ment independently. A sense of separateness of theself is increased. Phase 5 (16 to 24 Months), Rapprochement Phase.Awareness of separateness of the self becomesacute. This is frightening to the child, who wantsto regain some lost closeness but not return to sym-biosis. The child wants the mother there as neededfor \"emotional refueling\" and to maintain feelingsof security. Phase 6 (24 to 36 Months), On the Way to ObjectConstancy Phase. In this phase, the child com- pletes the individuation process and learns to re-late to objects in an effective, constant manner. Asense of separateness is established, and the childis able to internalize a sustained image of the lovedobject or person when out of sight. Separation anx-iety is resolved. The individual with borderline personality disorder becomes fixed in the rapprochement phase of devel-opment. This occurs when the child shows increasingseparation and autonomy. The mother, who feels se-cure in the relationship as long as the child is depend-ent, begins to feel threatened by the child's increasingindependence. The mother may indeed be experienc-ing her own fears of abandonment. In response to sep-aration behaviors, the mother withdraws the emotionalsupport or \"refueling\" that is so vitally needed duringthis phase for the child to feel secure. Instead, themother rewards clinging, dependent behaviors, andpunishes (withholding emotional support) independ-ent behaviors. With his or her sense of emotional sur-vival at stake, the child learns to behave in a mannerthat satisfies the parental wishes. An internal conflictdevelops within the child, based on fear of abandon-ment. He or she wants to achieve independence com-mon to this stage of development, but fears thatmother will withdraw emotional support as a result.This unresolved fear of abandonment remains with thechild into adulthood. Unresolved grief for the nurtur-ing they failed to receive results in internalized ragethat manifests itself in the depression so common inpeople with borderline personality disorder. Diagnosis/Outcome Identification Nursing diagnoses are formulated from the data gath-ered during the assessment phase and with backgroundknowledge regarding predisposing factors to the disor-der. Table 32-2 presents a list of client behaviors and theNANDA nursing diagnoses that correspond to these be-haviors, which may be used in planning care for clientswith borderline personality disorder. Outcome Criteria The following criteria may be used for measurementof outcomes in the care of clients with borderline per-sonality disorder. The client: Has not harmed self. Seeks out staff when desire for self-mutilation is strong. Is able to identify true source of anger. Expresses anger appropriately. Relates to more than one staff member. Completes activities of daily living independently. Does not manipulate one staff member against theother in order to fulfill own desires. Planning/Implementation The following section presents a group of selectednursing diagnoses common to clients with borderline682 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch32_669-702 24/07/14 5:33 PM Page 682personality disorder, with short- and long-term goals and nursing interventions for each. Risk for Self-Mutilation/Risk for Self-Directed or Other- Directed Violence Risk for self-mutilation is defined as \"at risk for deliberate self-injurious behavior causing tissue damage with the in- tent of causing nonfatal injury to attain relief of tension\"(NANDA International [NANDA-I], 2012, p. 451). Risk for self-directed or other-directed violence is defined as \"at risk for behaviors in which an individual demonstrates thathe or she can be physically, emotionally, and/or sexuallyharmful to self or others\" (NANDA-I, 2012, pp. 447, 448). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goals The client will seek out staff member if feelings ofharming self or others emerge. The client will not harm self or others. Long-Term Goal The client will not harm self or others. Interventions Observe the client's behavior frequently. Do thisthrough routine activities and interactions; avoidappearing watchful and suspicious. Close observa-tion is required so that intervention can occur if re-quired to ensure client's (and others') safety. Secure a verbal contract from the client that he orshe will seek out a staff member when the urge forself-mutilation is experienced. Discussing feelingsof self-harm with a trusted individual providessome relief to the client. A contract gets the subjectout in the open and places some of the responsi-bility for his or her safety with the client. An atti-tude of acceptance of the client as a worthwhileindividual is conveyed. If self-mutilation occurs, care for the client'swounds in a matter-of-fact manner. Do not give pos-itive reinforcement to this behavior by offeringsympathy or additional attention. Lack of attentionto the maladaptive behavior may decrease repeti-tion of its use. Encourage the client to talk about feelings he orshe was having just before this behavior occurred.To problem-solve the situation with the client,knowledge of the precipitating factors is important. Act as a role model for the appropriate expressionof angry feelings, and give positive reinforcementto the client when attempts to conform are made.It is vital that the client expresses angry feelings be-cause suicide and other self-destructive behaviorsare often viewed as a result of anger turned inwardon the self. Remove all dangerous objects from the client's en-vironment so that he or she may not purposefullyor inadvertently use them to inflict harm to self orothers. Try to redirect violent behavior with physical out-lets for the client's anxiety (e.g., punching bag, jog-ging). Physical exercise is a safe and effective wayof relieving pent-up tension.CHAPTER 32 Personality Disorders 683 TABLE 32-2 Assigning Nursing Diagnoses to Behaviors Commonly Associated With Borderline Personality Disorder BEHAVIORS NURSING DIAGNOSES Risk for self-mutilation Risk for self-directed violence; Risk for suicide Risk for other-directed violenceComplicated g rieving Impaired social interaction Disturbed personal identityAnxiety (severe to panic) Chronic low self-esteemRisk factors: History of self-injurious behavior; history of inability to plan solutions; impulsivity; irresistible urge to damage self; feels threatened with loss of significant relationship Risk factors: History of suicide attempts; suicidal ideation; suicidal plan; impulsiveness; childhood abuse; fears of abandonment; internalized rage Risk factors: Body language (e.g., rig id posture, clenching of fists and jaw, hyperactivity, pacing, breathlessness, threatening stances); history of childhood traumatic distress; verbalizes feeling empty; inappropriate expression of anger Alternating clinging and distancing behaviors; staff splitting; manipulation Feelings of depersonalization and derealizationTransient psychotic symptoms (disorganized thinking; misinterpretation of the environment); increased tension; decreased perceptual field Dependent on others; excessively seeks reassurance; manipulation of others; inability to tolerate being alone4092_Ch32_669-702 24/07/14 5:33 PM Page 683Have sufficient staff available to indicate a show of strength to the client if it becomes necessary. Thisconveys to the client evidence of control over the sit-uation and provides some physical security for staff. Administer tranquilizing medications as orderedby the physician or obtain an order if necessary.Monitor the client for effectiveness of the medica-tion and for the appearance of adverse side effects.Tranquilizing medications such as anxiolytics or an-tipsychotics may have a calming effect on the clientand may prevent aggressive behaviors. If client is not calmed by \"talking down\" or by med-ication, use of mechanical restraints may be neces-sary. The avenue of the \"least restrictive alternative\"must be selected when planning interventions fora violent client. Restraints should be used only as alast resort, after all other interventions have beenunsuccessful, and the client is clearly at risk ofharm to self or others. If restraint is deemed necessary, ensure that suffi-cient staff is available to assist. Follow protocol es-tablished by the institution. The Joint Commissionrequires that an in-person evaluation by a physicianor other licensed independent practitioner (LIP)be conducted within 1 hour of the initiation of therestraint or seclusion (The Joint Commission,2010). The physician or LIP must reissue a neworder for restraints every 4 hours for adults andevery 1 to 2 hours for children and adolescents. The Joint Commission requires that the client inrestraints be observed at least every 15 minutes toensure that circulation to extremities is not com-promised (check temperature, color, pulses); toassist the client with needs related to nutrition, hydration, and elimination; and to position theclient so that comfort is facilitated and aspirationis prevented. Some institutions may require con-tinuous one-to-one monitoring of restrainedclients, particularly those who are highly agitated,and for whom there is a high risk of self- or acciden-tal injury. As agitation decreases, assess the client's readinessfor restraint removal or reduction. Remove one re-straint at a time while assessing the client's re-sponse. This minimizes the risk of injury to clientand staff. If warranted by high acuity of the situation, staffmay need to be assigned on a one-to-one basis. Be-cause of their extreme fear of abandonment,clients with borderline personality disorder shouldnot be left alone at a stressful time as it may causean acute rise in anxiety and agitation levels. Complicated Grieving Complicated grieving is defined as \"a disorder that oc- curs after the death of a significant other [or anyother loss of significance to the individual], in whichthe experience of distress accompanying bereave-ment fails to follow normative expectations and man-ifests in functional impairment\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 365).

Physical exercise pro- vides a safe and effective method for dischargingpent-up tension. Explore with the client the true source of anger.This is painful therapy that often leads to regres-sion as the client deals with feelings of early aban-donment or abuse. It seems that sometimes theclient must \"get worse before he or she can get bet-ter.\" Reconciliation of the feelings associated withthis stage is necessary before progression throughthe grieving process can continue. As anger is displaced onto the nurse or therapist,caution must be taken to guard against the nega-tive effects of countertransference (see Chapter 7).These are very difficult clients who have the capac-ity for eliciting a whole array of negative feelingsfrom the therapist. The existence of negative feel-ings by the nurse or therapist must be acknowl-edged, but they must not be allowed to interferewith the therapeutic process. Explain the behaviors associated with the normalgrieving process. Help the client recognize his orher position in this process. Knowledge of the ac-ceptability of the feelings associated with normalgrieving may help to relieve some of the guilt thatthese responses generate. Help the client understand appropriate ways of ex-pressing anger. Give positive reinforcement for be-haviors used to express anger appropriately. Act asa role model. It is appropriate to let the client knowwhen he or she has done something that has gen-erated angry feelings in you. Role modeling waysto express anger in an appropriate manner is apowerful learning tool. Set limits on acting-out behaviors and explain theconsequences of violation of those limits. Be sup-portive, yet consistent and firm, in caring for thisclient. The client lacks sufficient self-control tolimit maladaptive behaviors, so assistance is re-quired. Without consistency on the part of all staffmembers working with this client, a positive out-come will not be achieved. Impaired Social Interaction Impaired social interaction is defined as \"insufficient or excessive quantity or ineffective quality of social exchange\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 320). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goal Within 5 days, client will discuss with nurse or ther-apist behaviors that impede the development of sat-isfactory interpersonal relationships.Long-Term Goal By the time of discharge from treatment, client willinteract appropriately with others in the therapysetting in both social and therapeutic activities (evidencing a discontinuation of splitting andclinging and distancing behaviors). Interventions Encourage the client to examine these behaviors(to recognize that they are occurring). He or shemay be unaware of splitting or of clinging and dis-tancing pattern of interaction with others. Recog-nition must take place before change can occur. Help the client understand that you will be available,without reinforcing dependent behaviors. Knowledgeof your availability may provide needed security. Rotate staff members who work with the client in orderto avoid his or her developing a dependence on partic-ular individuals. The client must learn to relate to morethan one staff member in an effort to decrease the useof splitting and to diminish fears of abandonment. With the client, explore feelings that relate to fearsof abandonment and engulfment. Help him or herto understand that clinging and distancing behav-iors are engendered by these fears. Exploration offeelings with a trusted individual may help theclient come to terms with unresolved issues. Help the client understand how these behaviors in-terfere with satisfactory relationships. He or she maybe unaware of how others perceive these behaviorsand why they are not acceptable. Assist the client to work toward achievement of objectconstancy. Be available, without promoting depend-ency. Give positive reinforcement for independentbehaviors. The client must resolve fears of abandon-ment in the process toward developing the ability toestablish satisfactory intimate relationships. CLINICAL PEARL Recognize when the client is playing one staff member against another. Remember that splitting is the primarydefense mechanism of these individuals, and the impressionsthey have of others as either \"good\" or \"bad\" are a manifesta-tion of this defense. Do not listen as the client tries to degradeother staff members. Suggest that the client discuss the problem directly with the staff person involved. Concept Care Mapping The concept map care plan is an innovative approach to planning and organizing nursing care (see Chapter 9).It is a diagrammatic teaching and learning strategythat allows visualization of interrelationships betweenmedical diagnoses, nursing diagnoses, assessmentdata, and treatments. An example of a concept mapcare plan for a client with borderline personality dis-order is presented in Figure 32-1.686 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch32_669-702 24/07/14 5:33 PM Page 686Evaluation Reassessment is conducted to determine if the nurs- ing actions have been successful in achieving the ob-jectives of care. Evaluation of the nursing actions forthe client with borderline personality disorder maybe facilitated by gathering information using the fol-lowing types of questions: Has the client been able to seek out staff when feel-ing the desire for self-harm?Has the client avoided self-harm? Can the client correlate times of desire for self-harm to times of elevation in level of anxiety? Can the client discuss feelings with staff (particu-larly feelings of depression and anger)? Can the client identify the true source towardwhich the anger is directed? Can the client verbalize understanding of the basisfor his or her anger?CHAPTER 32 Personality Disorders 687 Risk for self-mutilationImpaired social interactionRisk factor: Unresolved fears of abandonment Clinging and distancing behaviors Staff splitting Observe client's behavior frequently Secure verbal no-harm contract from client Care for wounds matter-of-factly Encourage verbalization of feelings Make environment safe Act as role model Examine inappropriate behaviors Encourage independence and give positive reinforcement Explore fears Explain inappropriateness of these behaviors Rotate staff Medical Rx: Olanzapine 5 mg bidFluoxetine 20 mg daily Client has not harmed self Seeks out staff when desire for self-mutilation occurs Relates to more than one staff member Completes ADLs independently Does not manipulate staff against each otherSigns and SymptomsSigns and Symptoms Nursing DiagnosisNursing Diagnosis Nursing Actions Nursing Actions Outcomes OutcomesComplicated grieving Depressed mood Acting-out behaviors Create trusting relationship Encourage appropriate expression of anger Explore true source of anger Teach stages of grief Set limits on acting-out behavior Give positive feedback Client expresses anger appropriately Understands stages of grief and the need for personal progression through this processSigns and Symptoms Nursing Diagnosis Nursing Actions OutcomesClinical Vignette: Clara, age 37, was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder when she was 22 years old. She has had counseling with the same therapist since the initial diagnosis. She suffers from chronic depression and unstable personality. Two days ago, at her regular counselling session, the therapist told Clara that in 1 month she was getting married and would be moving across the country with her new husband. She told Clara she would help her find a new therapist. Clara became hysterical and shouted, \"Y ou can't leave me! I don't want another therapist!\" That evening, Clara's husband, Bill, found her sitting in a pool of blood in the bathroom, having sliced the back of both calves with a razor blade. Bill took Clara to the hospital where she is well known by the staff. Her wounds were treated in the emergency department, and she was transferred to the psychiatric unit. She clings to the admitting nurse saying, \"Please don't leave. Y ou're the best nurse here. Y ou're the only one I can talk to.\" The nurse develops the following concept map care plan for Clara.

Can the client function independently? Can the client relate to more than one staff member? Can the client verbalize the knowledge that the staff members will return and are not abandoningthe client when leaving for the day? Can the client separate from the staff in an appro-priate manner? Can the client delay gratification and refrain frommanipulating others in order to fulfill own desires? Can the client verbalize resources within the com-munity from whom he or she may seek assistancein times of extreme stress? Antisocial Personality Disorder (Background Assessment Data) In the DSM-I, antisocial behavior was categorized as a \"sociopathic or psychopathic\" reaction that was symp-tomatic of any of several underlying personality disor-ders. The DSM-II represented it as a separate personality type, a distinction that has been retained in subsequenteditions. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality disorder are presented in Box 32-10. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder are seldom seen in most clinical settings, and when theyare, it is commonly a way to avoid legal consequences.Sometimes they are admitted to the health-care system by court order for psychological evaluation.Most frequently, however, these individuals may be en-countered in prisons, jails, and rehabilitation services. Clinical Picture Antisocial personality disorder is a pattern of sociallyirresponsible, exploitative, and guiltless behavior thatreflects a general disregard for the rights of others.These individuals exploit and manipulate others forpersonal gain and are unconcerned with obeying thelaw. They have difficulty sustaining consistent employ-ment and in developing stable relationships. They appear cold and callous, often intimidating otherswith their brusque and belligerent manner. They tendto be argumentative and, at times, cruel and mali-cious. They lack warmth and compassion and areoften suspicious of these qualities in others. Individuals with antisocial personality have a very low tolerance for frustration, act impetuously, and areunable to delay gratification. They are restless andeasily bored, often taking chances and seeking thrills,as if they were immune to danger. When things go their way, individuals with this dis- order act cheerful, even gracious and charming. Be-cause of their low tolerance for frustration, thispleasant exterior can change very quickly. When whatthey desire at the moment is challenged, they arelikely to become furious and vindictive. Easily pro-voked to attack, their first inclination is to demeanand dominate. They believe that \"good guys come inlast,\" and show contempt for the weak and underpriv-ileged. They exploit others to fulfill their own desires,showing no trace of shame or guilt for their behavior. Individuals with antisocial personalities see them- selves as victims, using projection as the primary egodefense mechanism. They do not accept responsibil-ity for the consequences of their behavior. Gormanand Sultan (2008) state: Manipulative individuals have come to suspect that any person or institution may try to control them, render-ing them powerless and vulnerable to attack. (p. 195) In their own minds, this perception justifies their malicious behavior, lest they be the recipient of unjust persecution and hostility from others. Satisfying interpersonal relationships are not pos- sible because individuals with antisocial personalities688 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation BOX 32-10 Diagnostic Criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder A. A pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others occurring since age 15 years, as indicated by three (or more) of the following: 1. Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as indicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest. 2. Deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure. 3. Impulsivity or failure to plan ahead. 4. Irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or assaults. 5. Reckless disregard for safety of self or others. 6. Consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain consistent work behavior or honor financial obligations. 7. Lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another. B. Individual is at least 18 years.C. There is evidence of conduct disorder with onset before age 15 years.D. The occurrence of antisocial behavior is not exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

American Psychiatric Association.4092_Ch32_669-702 24/07/14 5:33 PM Page 688have learned to place their trust only in themselves. They have a philosophy that \"it's every man for him-self,\" and that one should stop at nothing to avoidbeing manipulated by others. One of the most distinctive characteristics of indi- viduals with antisocial personality is their tendency toignore conventional authority and rules. They act asthough established social norms and guidelines forself-discipline and cooperative behavior do not applyto them. They are flagrant in their disrespect for thelaw and for the rights of others. Predisposing Factors to Antisocial Personality Disorder Biological Influences Antisocial personality is more common among first-degree biological relatives of those with the disorderthan among the general population (Tharp, 2009).Twin and adoptive studies have implicated the role ofgenetics in antisocial personality disorder (Skodol &Gunderson, 2008). These studies of families of indi-viduals with the disorder show higher numbers of rel-atives with antisocial personality or alcoholism thanare found in the general population. The studies havealso shown that children of parents with antisocial be-havior are more likely to be diagnosed with antisocialpersonality, even when they are separated at birthfrom their biological parents and reared by individu-als without the disorder. Characteristics associated with temperament in the newborn may be significant in the predisposition toantisocial personality disorder. Parents who bring theirchildren with behavior disorders to clinics often reportthat the child displayed temper tantrums from infancyand would become furious when awaiting a bottle ora diaper change. As these children mature, they com-monly develop a bullying attitude toward other chil-dren. Parents report that they are undaunted bypunishment and generally quite unmanageable. Theyare daring and foolhardy in their willingness to chancephysical harm, and they seem unaffected by pain. Fischer, Barkley, Smallish, and Fletcher (2002) iden- tified attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and con-duct disorder during childhood and adolescence aspredisposing factors to antisocial personality disorder. Although these biogenetic influences may describe some familial pattern to the development of antisocialpersonality disorder, no basic pathological process hasyet been determined as an etiological factor. Bienen-feld (2013) states: Low levels of behavioral inhibition may be mediated by serotonergic dysregulation in the septohippocam-pal system. There may also be developmental or ac-quired abnormalities in the prefrontal brain systemsand reduced autonomic activity in antisocial person-ality disorder. This may underlie the low arousal,poor fear conditioning, and decision-making deficitsdescribed in antisocial personality disorder. Family Dynamics Antisocial personality disorder frequently arises from a chaotic home environment. Parental depri-vation during the first 5 years of life appears to be acritical predisposing factor in the development ofantisocial personality disorder. Separation due toparental delinquency appears to be more highlycorrelated with the disorder than is parental lossfrom other causes. The presence or intermittent ap-pearance of inconsistent impulsive parents, not theloss of a consistent parent, is environmentally most damaging. Studies have shown that individuals with antisocial personality disorder often have been severely physicallyabused in childhood. The abuse contributes to the de-velopment of antisocial behavior in several ways. First,it provides a model for behavior. Second, it may resultin injury to the child's central nervous system, therebyCHAPTER 32 Personality Disorders 689 IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE Dekovic, M., Janssens, J.A.M., & Van As, N.M.C. (2003). Family predictors of antisocial behavior in adolescence. Family Process, 42(2), 223-235. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: The objective of this study was to examine the combined and unique ability of differ-ent aspects of family functioning to predict involvement inantisocial behavior in a large community (nonclinical) sam-ple of adolescents. T he aspects of family functioning that were measured included: 1.Proximal factors : parental child-rearing behaviors and the quality of the parent-adolescent relationship.2.Distal factors: parental characteristics (e.g., depres- sion; parental confidence in his or her competence as a parent) 3.Contextual factors: family characteristics (e.g., family cohesion, quality of the marital relationship; involve-ment between members) 4. Global factors: family socioeconomic status; family composition (e.g., single-parent family) The researchers hypothesized that proximal factors would play a stronger role in future antisocial behavior than the Continued4092_Ch32_669-702 24/07/14 5:33 PM Page 689impairing the child's ability to function appropriately. Finally, it engenders rage in the victimized child, whichis then displaced onto others in the environment. A number of factors associated with disordered family functioning have been implicated in the developmentof antisocial personality (Hill, 2003; Ramsland, 2013;Skodol & Gunderson, 2008). following circum-stances may influence the predisposition to antisocialpersonality disorder: Absence of parental discipline Extreme poverty Removal from the home Growing up without parental figures of both genders Erratic and inconsistent methods of discipline Being \"rescued\" each time they are in trouble(never having to suffer the consequences of one'sown behavior) Maternal deprivation Diagnosis/Outcome Identification Nursing diagnoses are formulated from the data gath-ered during the assessment phase and with backgroundknowledge regarding predisposing factors to the disor-der. Table 32-4 presents a list of client behaviors and theNANDA nursing diagnoses that correspond to those be-haviors, which may be used in planning care for clientswith antisocial personality disorder.Outcome Criteria The following criteria may be used for measurementof outcomes in the care of the client with antisocialpersonality disorder. The client: Discusses angry feelings with staff and in group sessions. Has not harmed self or others. Can rechannel hostility into socially acceptable behaviors. Follows rules and regulations of the therapy environment. Can verbalize which of his or her behaviors are notacceptable. Shows regard for the rights of others by delayinggratification of own desires when appropriate. Does not manipulate others in an attempt to increase feelings of self-worth. Verbalizes understanding of knowledge requiredto maintain basic health needs. Planning/Implementation The following section presents a group of selectednursing diagnoses common to clients with antisocialpersonality disorder, with short- and long-term goalsand nursing interventions for each.690 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE\u2014 cont'd other three variables. The sample included 508 families with an adolescent between 12 and 18 years. There were254 females and 254 males. The parent sample consistedof 969 parents (502 mothers and 467 fathers). Ninety-one percent of the families were intact families, 7 percentof the parents were divorced or separated, and 2 percentwere widowed. There was a wide range of socioeconomicand educational backgrounds, although the parents withlow educational and occupational levels were slightly un-derrepresented. Data were gathered in the subjects' homesthrough a battery of questionnaires administered individu-ally to adolescents, mothers, and fathers. RESULTS OF THE STUDY: Results showed that proximal fac- tors were significant predictors antisocial behavior , inde- pendent of their shared variance with other factors. Also consistent with the hypothesized model, the effects of dis-tal and contextual factors appear to be mostly indirect: aftertheir association with proximal factors was taken into ac-count, these factors were no longer significantly related toantisocial behavior . Global indicators of family functioning (socioeconomic status and family composition) were un-related to adolescent antisocial behavior. This study showedthat supportive parents, parents who use more subtlemeans of guidance (i.e., supervision rather than punitivestrategies), and parents who are consistent in their behaviortoward adolescents, have a lower risk that their child wouldbecome involved in antisocial behavior. Adolescents whoare exposed to coercive and hostile parenting probablyadopt this aggressive style of interacting with others. Theparent-adolescent relationship that was characterized by el-evated levels of conflict and a lack of closeness and accept-ance emerged as a risk factor for involvement in antisocialbehavior. Parental depression, conflict in the marital dyad,and lack of cohesion between members were also foundto influence adolescent antisocial behavior, but less directlythan the proximal factors. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Nurses may use this information to design and implement effective parenting programs. Nurses can become actively involved in teaching parents, in inpatient, outpatient, and community educationprog rams. The researchers state, \"The findings of this study suggest that, when designing interventions that focus onfamily factors, in addition to teaching parents adequatechild-rearing skills, more attention should be given to findingmethods to improve the general quality of the parent-ado- lescent relationship.\"4092_Ch32_669-702 24/07/14 5:33 PM Page 690Risk for Other-Directed Violence Risk for other-directed violence is defined as \"at risk for behaviors in which an individual demonstrates that he or she can be physically, emotionally, and/or sexually harmful to others\" (NANDA-I, 2012, p. 447). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. Short-Term Goals Within 3 days, client will discuss angry feelings andsituations that precipitate hostility. Client will not harm others. Long-Term Goal Client will not harm others. Interventions Convey an accepting attitude toward this client.Feelings of rejection are undoubtedly familiar tohim or her. Work on development of trust. Be hon-est, keep all promises, and convey the message tothe client that it is not him or her, but the behavior that is unacceptable. An attitude of acceptance pro-motes feelings of self-worth. Trust is the basis of atherapeutic relationship. Maintain a low level of stimuli in the client's environ-ment (low lighting, few people, simple decor, lownoise level). A stimulating environment may increaseagitation and promote aggressive behavior. Observe the client's behavior frequently. Do thisthrough routine activities and interactions; avoidappearing watchful and suspicious. Close obser-vation is required so that intervention can occurif needed to ensure the client's (and others')safety. Remove all dangerous objects from the client's en-vironment so that he or she may not purposefullyor inadvertently use them to inflict harm to self orothers. Help the client identify the true object of his or herhostility (e.g., \"You seem to be upset with . . .\"). Be-cause of weak ego development, the client may bemisusing the defense mechanism of displacement.Helping him or her recognize this in a nonthreat-ening manner may help reveal unresolved issues sothat they may be confronted. Encourage the client to gradually verbalize hostilefeelings. Verbalization of feelings in a nonthreateningenvironment may help client come to terms with unresolved issues. Explore with the client alternative ways of handlingfrustration (e.g., large motor skills that channelhostile energy into socially acceptable behavior).Physically demanding activities help to relieve pent-up tension. The staff should maintain and convey a calm atti-tude toward the client. Anxiety is contagious andcan be transferred from staff to client. A calm atti-tude provides the client with a feeling of safety andsecurity. Have sufficient staff available to present a showof strength to the client if necessary. This conveysto the client evidence of control over the situa-tion and provides some physical security for thestaff. Administer tranquilizing medications as ordered bythe physician or obtain an order if necessary.

Antianxietyagents (e.g., lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, ox-azepam) produce a calming effect and may help toallay hostile behaviors. ( NOTE: Medications are not often prescribed for clients with antisocial personalitydisorder because of these individuals' strong suscep-tibility to addictions.) If client is not calmed by \"talking down\" or by med-ication, use of mechanical restraints may be neces-sary. The avenue of the \"least restrictive alternative\"must be selected when planning interventions fora violent client. Restraints should be used only as alast resort, after all other interventions have beenunsuccessful, and the client is clearly at risk ofharm to self or others. If restraint is deemed necessary, ensure that suf-ficient staff is available to assist. Follow protocolestablished by the institution. The Joint Commis-sion requires that an in-person evaluation by aphysician or other licensed independent practi-tioner (LIP) be conducted within 1 hour of theinitiation of the restraint or seclusion (The JointCommission, 2010). The physician or LIP mustreissue a new order for restraints every 4 hoursfor adults and every 1 to 2 hours for children andadolescents. The Joint Commission requires that the client inrestraints be observed at least every 15 minutes toensure that circulation to extremities is not com-promised (check temperature, color, pulses); to as-sist the client with needs related to nutrition,hydration, and elimination; and to position theclient so that comfort is facilitated and aspirationis prevented. Some institutions may require con-tinuous one-to-one monitoring of restrainedclients, particularly those who are highly agitated,and for whom there is a high risk of self- or acci-dental injury. As agitation decreases, assess the client's readinessfor restraint removal or reduction. Remove one re-straint at a time while assessing the client's re-sponse. This minimizes the risk of injury to clientand staff. Defensive Coping Defensive coping is defined as \"repeated projection of falsely positive self-evaluation based on a self-protec-tive pattern that defends against underlying per-ceived threats to positive self-regard\" (NANDA-I,2012, p. 346). Client Goals Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined.Short-Term Goals Within 24 hours after admission, client will verbal-ize understanding of treatment setting rules andregulations and the consequences for violation of them. Client will verbalize personal responsibility for dif-ficulties experienced in interpersonal relationshipswithin (time period reasonable for client). Long-Term Goals By the time of discharge from treatment, the clientwill be able to cope more adaptively by delayinggratification of own desires and following rules andregulations of the treatment setting. By the time of discharge from treatment, the clientwill demonstrate ability to interact with others with-out becoming defensive, rationalizing behaviors, orexpressing grandiose ideas. Interventions From the onset, the client should be made awareof which behaviors are acceptable and which arenot. Explain consequences of violation of thelimits. A consequence must involve something ofvalue to the client. All staff must be consistent inenforcing these limits. Consequences should beadministered in a matter-of-fact manner imme-diately following the infraction. Because theclient cannot (or will not) impose own limits onmaladaptive behaviors, these behaviors must bedelineated and enforced by staff. Undesirableconsequences may help to decrease repetition ofthese behaviors. The ideal goal would be for this client to eventu-ally internalize societal norms, beginning with astep-by-step, \"either/or\" approach on the unit ( ei- theryou do [don't do] this, orthis will occur). Ex- planations must be concise, concrete, and clear,with little or no capacity for misinterpretation. CLINICAL PEARL Do not attempt to coax or convince the client to do the \"right thing.\" Do not use the words \"You should (or shouldn't) . . .\"; instead, use the words \"You will be expected to . . .\" Provide positive feedback or reward for acceptable be- haviors. Positive reinforcement enhances self-esteemand encourages repetition of desirable behaviors. In an attempt to assist the client to delay gratifica-tion, begin to increase the length of time require-ment for acceptable behavior in order to achieve thereward. For example, 2 hours of acceptable behaviormay be exchanged for a phone call; 4 hours of ac-ceptable behavior for 2 hours of television; 1 day of 692 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation4092_Ch32_669-702 24/07/14 5:33 PM Page 692acceptable behavior for a recreational therapy bowl- ing activity; 5 days of acceptable behavior for a week-end pass. A milieu unit provides the appropriate environ-ment for the client with antisocial personality. Thedemocratic approach, with specific rules and reg-ulations, community meetings, and group therapysessions emulates the type of societal situation inwhich the client must learn to live. Feedback frompeers is often more effective than confrontationfrom an authority figure. The client learns to followthe rules of the group as a positive step in the pro-gression toward internalizing the rules of society. Help the client to gain insight into his or her ownbehavior. Often, these individuals rationalize tosuch an extent that they deny that their behavioris inappropriate. For example, thinking may be re-flected in statements such as: \"The owner of thisstore has so much money, he'll never miss the littlebit I take. He has everything, and I have nothing.It's not fair! I deserve to have some of what he has.\"The client must come to understand that certainbehaviors will not be tolerated within the societyand that severe consequences will be imposed onthose individuals who refuse to comply. The clientmust want to become a productive member of so- ciety before he or she can be helped. Talk about past behaviors with the client. Discusswhich behaviors are acceptable by societal normsand which are not. Help the client identify ways inwhich he or she has exploited others. Encouragethe client to explore how he or she would feel if thecircumstances were reversed. An attempt may bemade to enlighten the client to the sensitivity of oth-ers by promoting self-awareness in an effort to helpthe client gain insight into his or her own behavior. Throughout the relationship with the client, main-tain an attitude of \"It is not you, but your behavior , that is unacceptable.\" An attitude of acceptancepromotes feelings of dignity and self-worth. Concept Care Mapping The concept map care plan is an innovative approachto planning and organizing nursing care (see Chapter 9).It is a diagrammatic teaching and learning strategythat allows visualization of interrelationships betweenmedical diagnoses, nursing diagnoses, assessmentdata, and treatments. An example of a concept mapcare plan for a client with antisocial personality disor-der is presented in Figure 32-2. Evaluation Reassessment is conducted to determine if the nurs-ing actions have been successful in achieving the ob-jectives of care. Evaluation of the nursing actions forthe client with antisocial personality disorder may befacilitated by gathering information using the follow-ing types of questions: Does the client recognize when anger is getting outof control? Can the client seek out staff instead of expressinganger in an inappropriate manner? Can the client use other sources for rechannelinganger (e.g., physical activities)? Has harm to others been avoided? Can the client follow rules and regulations of thetherapeutic milieu with little or no reminding? Can the client verbalize which behaviors are appro-priate and which are not? Does the client express a desire to change? Can the client delay gratifying own desires in def-erence to those of others when appropriate? Does the client refrain from manipulating othersto fulfill own desires? Does the client fulfill activities of daily living will-ingly and independently? Can the client verbalize methods of achieving andmaintaining optimal wellness? Can the client verbalize community resources fromwhich he or she can seek assistance with daily livingand healthcare needs when required? Treatment Modalities Few would argue that treatment of individuals withpersonality disorders is difficult and, in some in-stances, may even seem impossible. Personality char-acteristics are learned very early in life and perhapsmay even be genetic. It is not surprising, then, thatthese enduring patterns of behavior may take years tochange, if change occurs. Skodol and Gunderson(2008) state: Because personality disorders have been thought to consist of deeply ingrained attitudes and behaviorpatterns that consolidate during development andhave endured since early adulthood, they have tradi-tionally been believed to be very resistant to change.Moreover, treatment efforts are further confoundedby the degree to which patients with personality dis-orders do not recognize their maladaptive personalitytraits as undesirable or in need of change. (p. 831) Most clinicians believe it best to strive for lessening the inflexibility of the maladaptive traits and reducing their interference with everyday functioning andmeaningful relationships. Little research exists toguide the decision of which therapy is most appropri-ate in the treatment of personality disorders. Selec-tion of intervention is generally based on the area ofgreatest dysfunction, such as cognition, affect, behav-ior, or interpersonal relations. Following is a brief CHAPTER 32 Personality Disorders 6934092_Ch32_669-702 24/07/14 5:33 PM Page 693description of various types of therapies and the dis- orders to which they are customarily suited. Interpersonal Psychotherapy Depending on the therapeutic goals, interpersonalpsychotherapy with personality disorders is brief andtime-limited, or it may involve long-term exploratorypsychotherapy. Interpersonal psychotherapy may beparticularly appropriate because personality disorderslargely reflect problems in interpersonal style. Long-term psychotherapy attempts to understand and modify the maladjusted behaviors, cognition, andaffects of clients with personality disorders that dom-inate their personal lives and relationships. The coreelement of treatment is the establishment of an empathic therapist-client relationship based on 694 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation Risk for other- directed violenceDefensive copingRisk factors: Rage reactions Negative role modeling History of violence Disregard for societal norms and laws Absence of guilt Inability to delay gratification Unconditional acceptance Low environmental stimuli Observe behavior routinely Make environment safe Explore true object of anger Gradually encourage appropriate expression of anger Show of strength, if necessary Give meds as ordered Restrain if required Explain acceptable behaviors and consequences of violation Explain clearly what is expected of client Positive feedback and rewards for acceptable behaviors Provide milieu environment Promote insight development Maintain attitude of acceptance Medical Rx:Lorazepam 2 mgq 6h prn for agitation Client has not harmed self or others Discusses angry feelings with staff Engages in physical exercise to rechannel hostile feelings Demonstrates socially acceptable behavior on the unit Is able to delay personal gratification Does not manipulate others for own desiresSigns and SymptomsSigns and Symptoms Nursing DiagnosisNursing Diagnosis Nursing Actions Nursing Actions Outcomes OutcomesClinical Vignette: Hank, age 32, is the oldest of five children of a single mother, each of whom had a different father. He was physically abused by his mother's boyfriends, did not attend school regularly, and eventually dropped out in 10th grade. He has a history of violence, always carries a weapon (gun or knife) on his person, and threatens to use it if he is challenged in his attempts to fulfill his own desires. He has had numerous skirmishes with the law: shoplifting, auto theft, possession and sale of heroin and cocaine, and, most recently, armed robbery of a liquor store. He was identified by his image on the store's surveillance camera. Because of his long history of criminal behavior, the judge has ordered that Hank undergo psychological testing before he is sentenced. On the psychiatric unit, he says to the nurse, \"Why am I here? I'm not crazy! And I've never hurt anybody! I don't belong in this loony bin!\" The nurse develops the following concept map care plan for Hank.

Interpersonal psychotherapy is suggested for clients with paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal, borderline, de-pendent, narcissistic, and obsessive-compulsive per-sonality disorders. Psychoanalytical Psychotherapy The treatment of choice for individuals with histrionicpersonality disorder has been psychoanalytical psy-chotherapy (Skodol & Gunderson, 2008). Treatmentfocuses on the unconscious motivation for seekingtotal satisfaction from others and for being unable tocommit oneself to a stable, meaningful relationship. Milieu or Group Therapy This treatment is especially appropriate for individu-als with antisocial personality disorder, who respondmore adaptively to support and feedback from peers.In milieu or group therapy, feedback from peers ismore effective than in one-to-one interaction with atherapist. Group therapy\u2014particularly homogenous sup- portive groups that emphasize the development of so-cial skills\u2014may be helpful in overcoming socialanxiety and developing interpersonal trust and rap-port in clients with avoidant personality disorder. Feminist consciousness-raising groups can be use- ful in helping dependent clients struggling with social-role stereotypes. Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy Behavioral strategies offer reinforcement for positivechange. Social skills training and assertiveness trainingteach alternative ways to deal with frustration. Cognitivestrategies help the client recognize and correct inaccu-rate internal mental schemata. This type of therapy maybe useful for clients with obsessive-compulsive, antiso-cial, and avoidant personality disorders. Dialectical Behavior Therapy Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a type of psy-chotherapy that was originally developed by MarshaLinehan, PhD, as a treatment for the chronic self-injurious and parasuicidal behavior of clients withborderline personality disorder (Sadock & Sadock,2007). It is a complex, eclectic treatment that com-bines the concepts of cognitive, behavioral, and inter-personal therapies with Eastern mindfulness practices(Dimeff & Linehan, 2001). Dimeff and Linehan(2001) identify the following five functions of DBT: 1.To enhance behavioral capabilities 2.To improve motivation to change 3.To ensure that new capabilities generalize to thenatural environment4.To structure the treatment environment such thatclient and therapist capabilities are supported andeffective behaviors are reinforced 5.To enhance therapist capabilities and motivationto treat clients effectively The four primary modes of treatment in DBT include the following: 1. Group skills training. In these groups, clients are taught skills considered relevant to the particular problems experienced by people with borderlinepersonality disorder, such as core mindfulness skills, interpersonal effectiveness skills, emotionmodulation skills, and distress tolerance skills(Kiehn & Swales, 2013). 2 . Individual psychotherapy. Weekly sessions in which dysfunctional behavioral patterns, personal moti-vation, and skills strengthening are addressed. 3. Telephone contact. The therapist is available to the client by telephone, usually on a 24-hour per daybasis, but according to limits set by the therapist.Kiehn and Swales (2013) state, \"Telephone contact is to give the patient help and support in applyingthe skills that she is learning to her real life situa-tion between sessions and to help her find ways ofavoiding self-injur y.\" 4. Therapist consultation/team meeting. Therapists meet regularly to review their work with theirclients. These meetings are focused specifically onproviding support for each other, keeping the therapists motivated, and providing effective treat-ment to their clients (Dimeff & Linehan, 2001). In controlled studies, DBT has been shown to di- minish self-destructive behaviors in clients with bor - derline personality disorder. Additionally, DBT hasshown to decrease the drop-out rate from treatmentand the number of hospitalizations. Improvement hasalso been shown in reducing anger and in global andsocial adjustment scores (Dimeff & Linehan, 2001).This method of treatment is now being used withother disorders, including substance use disorders,eating disorders, schizophrenia, and post-traumaticstress disorder (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Psychopharmacology Psychopharmacology may be helpful in some in-stances. Although these drugs have no effect in thedirect treatment of the disorder itself, some sympto-matic relief can be achieved. Antipsychotic medica-tions are helpful in the treatment of psychoticdecompensations experienced by clients with para-noid, schizotypal, and borderline personality disor-ders (Skodol & Gunderson, 2008). A variety of pharmacological interventions have been used with borderline personality disorder. TheCHAPTER 32 Personality Disorders 6954092_Ch32_669-702 24/07/14 5:33 decreasing impulsivity and self-destructiveacts in these clients. The MAOIs are not commonlyused, however, because of concerns about violationsof dietary restrictions and the higher risk of fatalitywith overdose. The combination of an SSRI and anatypical antipsychotic has been successful in treatingdysphoria, mood instability, and impulsivity in clientswith borderline personality disorder (Schatzberg,Cole, & DeBattista, 2010). Antipsychotics have re-sulted in improvement in illusions, ideas of reference,paranoid thinking, anxiety, and hostility in someclients.Lithium carbonate and propranolol (Inderal) may be useful for the violent episodes observed in clientswith antisocial personality disorder (Coccaro & Siever,2000). Caution must be given to prescribing medica-tions outside the structured setting because of thehigh risk for substance abuse by these individuals. For the client with avoidant personality disorder, anxiolytics are sometimes helpful whenever previ-ously avoided behavior is being attempted. The merepossession of the medication may be reassuranceenough to help the client through the stressful pe-riod. Antidepressants, such as sertraline (Zoloft) andparoxetine (Paxil), may be useful with these clients ifpanic disorder develops.696 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE Nickel, M.K., Muehlbacher, M., Nickel, C., Kettler, & of patients with borderlinepersonality disorder: A double-blind, placebo-controlledstudy. American Journal of Psychiatry, 163(5), 833-838. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to determine whether aripiprazole is effective in the treat-ment of several domains of symptoms of borderline per-sonality disorder (B PD). Subjects included 43 women and 9 men who met the DSM criteria for BPD. Subjects wererandomly assigned to 15 mg/day of aripiprazole or placebofor 8 weeks. Outcome measures included changes inscores on the symptom checklist (SCL-90-R), the HamiltonDepression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Hamilton AnxietyRating Scale (HAM-A), and the State-Trait Anger ExpressionInventory. Test results were assessed weekly, along withside effects and self-injury reports using a non-validatedquestionnaire. RESULTS OF THE STUDY: Aripiprazole was associated with a significantly greater rate of improvement than the placebogroup on most of the SCL-90-R scales (with the exception of somatization), as well as on the HAM-D and HAM-A, and onall of the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory scales. Self-injury occurred during the course of the 8-week trial, but only2 episodes occurred in the aripiprazole group, compared with7 in the placebo group. The most commonly reported sideeffects of aripiprazole included headache, insomnia, nausea,numbness, constipation, and anxiety. No significant weightchanges were observed, and no serious side effects or suici-dal attempts occurred during the study. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The authors state, \"Aripiprazole appears to be a safe and effective agent for improving not only the symptoms of borderline personalitydisorder but also the associated health-related quality of lifeand interpersonal problems.\" Nurses who work with individ-uals who have BPD should be familiar with this medicationand understand the nursing implications associated with itsadministration. The implications of this study are particularlysignificant for nurses who have prescriptive authority andtreat clients with BPD. CASE STUDY AND SAMPLE CARE PLAN NURSING HISTORY AND ASSESSMENT Anthony, age 34, has been admitted to the psychiatric unit with a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. He wasrecently arrested and convicted for armed robbery of aconvenience store, and attempted murder of the storeclerk. Due to the actions of the store clerk, who quicklyalerted police, and to the store surveillance camera, An-thony was identified and apprehended within hours of thecrime. The judge has ordered physical, neurological, andpsychiatric evaluations before sentencing Anthony.Anthony was physically and psychologically abused as a child by his alcoholic father. He was suspended from highschool because of failing grades and habitual truancy. Hehas a long history of arrests, beginning with shoplifting atage 7, and progressing in adolescence to burglary, auto theft,and sexual assault, and finally to armed robbery, and at-tempted murder. He was out on probation when he com-mitted his latest crime. On the psychiatric unit, Anthony is loud, belligerent, and uncooperative. When Carol, his admitting nurse, arrives to 4092_Ch32_669-702 24/07/14 5:33 PM Page 696CHAPTER 32 Personality Disorders 697 CASE STUDY AND SAMPLE CARE PLAN work the evening shift on Anthony's second hospital day, he says to her, \"I'm so glad you are finally here. You arethe best nurse on the unit. I can't talk to anyone but you.These people are nothing but a bunch of loonies aroundhere . . . and that includes staff as well as patients! Maybeyou and I could walk down to the coffee shop togetherlater. Are you married? I'd sure like to get to know you bet-ter after I get out of this nut house!\" NURSING DIAGNOSES/OUTCOME IDEN- TIFICATION From the assessment data, the nurse develops the follow- ing nursing diagnoses for Anthony: 1.Risk for other-directed violence related to history of violence against others and history of childhood abuse. a.Shor t-Term Goals: Client will discuss angry feelings and situations that precipitate hostility. Client will not harm others. b. Long-Term Goal: Client will not harm others. 2.Defensive coping related to low self-esteem, dysfunc-tional nuclear family , underdeveloped ego and super- ego, evidenced by absence of guilt feelings, disregardfor societal laws and norms, inability to delay g ratifica- tion, superior attitude toward others, denial of problems,and projection of blame and responsibility. a. Short-Term Goals: Client will verbalize understand- ing of unit rules and regulations and consequencesfor violation of them. b. Long-Term Goal: Client will be able to delay gratifi- cation and follow rules and regulations of the unit.Client will verbalize personal responsibility for ownactions and behaviors. PLANNING/IMPLEMENTATION RISK FOR OTHER-DIRECTED VIOLENCE The following nursing interventions have been identifiedfor Anthony. 1.Develop a trusting relationship with Anthony by convey- ing an accepting attitude. Ensure that he understands itis not himbut his behavior that is unacceptable. 2.Try to keep excess stimuli out of the environment.Speak to Anthony in a calm quiet voice. 3.Observe Anthony's behavior regularly. Do this throughroutine activity so that he doesn't become suspiciousand ang ry about being watched. T his is important so that if hostile and aggressive behaviors are observed,intervention may prevent harm to Anthony, staff mem-bers, and/or other patients. 4.Sit with Anthony and encourage him to talk about hisanger and hostile feelings. Help him understand wherethese feelings orig i nate and who is the true target of the hostility. 5.Help him develop adaptive ways of dealing with frustra-tion, such as exercise and other physical activities. 6.Administer tranquilizing medication, as ordered by thephysician. 7.If Anthony should become out of control and mechanicalrestraints become necessary , ensure that sufficient staff is available to intervene. Do not use restraints as a pun-ishment, but only as a protective measure for Anthonyand the other patients. DEFENSIVE COPING The following nursing interventions have been identified forAnthony. 1.Explain to Anthony which of his behaviors are acceptable on the unit and which are not. Simply state that unac-ceptable behaviors will not be tolerated. 2.Determine appropriate consequences for violation ofthese limits (e.g., no T V or movies; no phone calls; time- out room). Ensure that all staff members follow throughwith these consequences. 3.Don't be taken in by this \"charmer .\" Compliments from Anthony are another form of manipulative behavior . Ex- plain to Anthony that you will not accept these types ofcomments from him, and if they continue, impose con-sequences. 4.Encourage Anthony to talk about his past misdeeds. T ry to help him understand how he would feel if someonetreated him in the manner that he has treated others. EVALUATION The outcome criteria for Anthony have only partially beenmet. Personality characteristics such as those of Anthony'sare deep-rooted and enduring. He is not likely to change.Unless testing reveals a serious medical problem, Anthonywill no doubt go to prison for most of the rest of his life.During his time on the psychiatric unit, harm to self and oth-ers has been avoided. He has discussed his anger and hos-tile feelings with Carol and other staff members. Hecontinues to become belligerent when told that he cannotsmoke on the unit and must wait for someone to escorthim to the smoking area. He yells at the other patients andcalls them \"nut cases.\" He refuses to take responsibility forhis actions and blames negative behavioral outcomes onothers. He has begun a regular exercise program in the fit-ness room, and receives positive feedback from the staff forthis attempt to integrate healthier coping strategies. 4092_Ch32_669-702 24/07/14 5:33 PM Page 697Summary and Key Points Clients with personality disorders are undoubtedly some of the most difficult ones health-care workersare likely to encounter. Personality characteristics are formed very early inlife and are difficult, if not impossible, to change.In fact, some clinicians believe the therapeutic ap-proach is not to try to change the characteristics butrather to decrease the inflexibility of the maladap-tive traits and reduce their interference with every-day functioning and meaningful relationships. The concept of a personality disorder has beenpresent throughout the history of medicine. Prob-lems have arisen in the attempt to establish a clas-sification system for these disorders. The DSM-5 identifies ten individual dis- orders: narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, para-noid, schizoid, and schizotypal. Nursing care of the client with a personality disor-der is accomplished using the steps of the nursingprocess. Other treatment modalities include interpersonalpsychotherapy, psychoanalytical psychotherapy, milieu or group therapy, cognitive/behavioral ther-apy, dialectical behavior therapy, and psychophar-macology. Individuals with borderline personality disordermay enter the health-care system because of theirinstability and frequent attempts at self-destructivebehavior. The individual with antisocial personality disordermay become part of the health-care system to avoidlegal consequences or because of a court order forpsychological evaluation. Nurses who work in all types of clinical settingsshould be familiar with the characteristics associ-ated with personality disorders. Nurses working in psychiatry must be knowledge-able about appropriate intervention with theseclients, for it is unlikely that they will encounter agreater professional challenge than these clientspresent.698 UNIT 4 Nursing Care of Clients With Alterations in Psychosocial Adaptation Additional info available at www.davisplus.com Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

Her husband took her to the emer-gency department when he walked into the bathroom and foundher cutting her legs with a razor blade. At that time, assessment re-vealed that Lana had a long history of self-mutilation, which shehad carefully hidden from her husband and others. Lana beganlong-term psychoanalytical psychotherapy on an outpatient basis.Therapy revealed that Lana had been physically and sexuallyabused as a child by both her mother and her father, both now de-ceased. She admitted to having chronic depression, and her hus-band related episodes of rage reactions. Lana has been hospitalizedon the psychiatric unit for a week because of suicidal ideations. Aftermaking a no-suicide contract with the staff, she is allowed to leavethe unit on pass to keep a dental appointment that she made anumber of weeks ago. She has just returned to the unit and saysto her nurse, \"I just took 20 Desyrel while I was sitting in my car inthe parking lot.\" Answer the following questions related to Lana: 1.The nurse is well acquainted with Lana and believes this is a ma-nipulative gesture. How should the nurse handle this situation? 2.What is the priority nursing diagnosis for Lana? 3.Lana likes to \"split\" the staff into \"bad guys.\"What is the most impor tant intervention for splitting by a per- son with borderline personality disorder? Communication Exercises 1.Nathan, age 37, has been admitted to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation after being arrested forarmed robbery of a convenience store. He has ahistory of encounters with law enforcement sinceearly adolescence. He has been diagnosed with an-tisocial personality disorder. Nathan says to thenurse, \"Hey pretty lady! Where have you been allmy life?\" \u0081How would the nurse respond appropriately tothis statement by Nathan? 2.\"I really got a bum rap! I had no intentions of hurt-ing anyone. The gun only had one bullet in it! I justwanted to scare that clerk into giving me a fewbucks!

That is not to say thatsome of the disorders discussed in this chapter do notappear later in life or that symptoms associated withother disorders, such as major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder, do not appear in childhood oradolescence. These disorders, with consideration of the variances in age and developmental level, arediscussed in Chapters 25 and 26. Developmental theories were discussed in Chapter 3. All nurses working with children or adolescentsshould be knowledgeable about \"normal\" stages ofgrowth and development. At best, the developmentalprocess is one that is fraught with frustrations and difficulties. Behavioral responses are individual andidiosyncratic. They are, indeed, human responses. Whether or not a child's behavior indicates emotional problems is often difficult to determine.Guidelines for making such a determination shouldconsider appropriateness of the behavior regardingage and cultural norms and whether the behavior interferes with adaptive functioning. This chapterfocuses on the nursing process in care of clients withintellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, Tourette'sdisorder, and separation anxiety disorder. Additionaltreatment modalities are included. Neurodevelopmental Disorders Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder) The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor- ders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Asso- ciation [APA], 2013) defines intellectual disability asa \"disorder with onset during the developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptivefunctioning deficits in conceptual, social, and practi-cal domains\" (p. 33). Onset of intellectual and adap-tive deficits occurs during the developmental period.Level of severity (mild, moderate, severe, or pro-found) is based on adaptive functioning within thethree domains. General intellectual functioning ismeasured by both clinical assessment and an individ-ual's performance on intelligence quotient (IQ) tests.Adaptive functioning refers to the person's ability to adapt to the requirements of daily living and the expectations of his or her age and cultural group.The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for intellectual disabil- ity are presented in Box 33-1. Predisposing Factors The etiology of intellectual disability may be primarilybiological, primarily psychosocial, a combination ofboth, or in some instances, unknown. Black and Andreasen (2011) state that intellectual disability \"isa syndrome that represents a final common pathwayproduced by a variety of factors that injure the brainand affect its normal development\" (p. 411). Genetic Factors Genetic factors are implicated as the cause of intel-lectual disability in approximately 5 percent of thecases. These factors include inborn errors of metabo-lism, such as Tay-Sachs disease, phenylketonuria, andhyperglycinemia. Also included are chromosomal disorders, such as Down syndrome and Klinefelter'ssyndrome, and single-gene abnormalities, such astuberous sclerosis and neurofibromatosis. Disruptions in Embryonic Development Conditions that result in early alterations in embryonicdevelopment account for approximately 30 percent ofCHAPTER 33 Children and Adolescents 705 BOX 33-1 Diagnostic Criteria for Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder) Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) is a disorder with onset during the developmental period thatincludes both intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits inconceptual, social, and practical domains. The following threecriteria must be met: A. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, prob- lem solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, aca-demic learning, and learning from experience, confirmedby both clinical assessment and individualized, standard-ized intelligence testing. B. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet developmental and sociocultural standards for per-sonal independence and social responsibility. Withoutongoing support the adaptive deficits limit functioning inone or more activities of daily life, such as communica-tion, social participation, and independent living, acrossmultiple environments, such as home, school, work, andcommunity. C. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.

Damages may occur in response to toxicity associated with maternal inges-tion of alcohol or other drugs. Maternal illnessesand infections during pregnancy (e.g., rubella, cytomegalovirus) and complications of pregnancy(e.g., toxemia, uncontrolled diabetes) also can resultin congenital intellectual disability (Sadock &Sadock, 2007). Pregnancy and Perinatal Factors Approximately 10 percent of cases of intellectual dis-ability are the result of circumstances that occur dur-ing pregnancy (e.g., fetal malnutrition, viral andother infections, and prematurity) or during the birthprocess. Examples of the latter include trauma to thehead incurred during the process of birth, placentaprevia or premature separation of the placenta, andprolapse of the umbilical cord. General Medical Conditions Acquired in Infancy or Childhood General medical conditions acquired during infancy or childhood account for approximately 5 percent of cases of intellectual disability. They include infec-tions, such as meningitis and encephalitis; poisonings,such as from insecticides, medications, and lead; and physical trauma, such as head injuries, asphyxiation,and hyperpyrexia (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Sociocultural Factors and Other Mental Disorders Between 15 and 20 percent of cases of intellectual dis-ability may be attributed to deprivation of nurturanceand social stimulation and to impoverished environ-ments associated with poor prenatal and perinatalcare and inadequate nutrition. Additionally, severemental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder,can result in intellectual disability. Recognition of the cause and period of inception provides information regarding what to expect interms of behavior and potential. However, each childis different, and consideration must be given on anindividual basis in every case. Application of the Nursing Process to Intellectual Disability Background Assessment Data (Symptomatology) The degree of severity of intellectual disability may be measured by the client's IQ level. Four levels havebeen delineated: mild, moderate, severe, and pro-found. The various behavioral manifestations andabilities associated with each of these levels of severityare outlined in Table 33-1.706 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations TABLE 33-1 Developmental Characteristics of Intellectual Disability by Degree of Severity ABILITY TO PERFORM COGNITIVE/EDUCATIONAL SOCIAL/COMMUNICATION PSYCHOMOTOR LEVEL (IQ) SELF-CARE ACTIVITIES CAPABILITIES CAPABILITIES CAPABILITIES Mild (50-7 0) Moderate (35-49) Severe (20-34) Profound (below 20) SOURCES: ent living, with assistance duringtimes of stress.

Knowledge re- garding level of independence in the performanceof self-care activities is essential to the develop-ment of an adequate plan for the provision of nurs-ing care. Nursing Diagnosis Selection of appropriate nursing diagnoses for theclient with intellectual disability depends largely onthe degree of severity of the condition and the client'scapabilities. Possible nursing diagnoses include thefollowing: Risk for injury related to altered physical mobilityor aggressive behavior Self-care deficit related to altered physical mobilityor lack of maturity Impaired verbal communication related to devel-opmental alteration Impaired social interaction related to speech de-ficiencies or difficulty adhering to conventionalsocial behavior Delayed growth and development related to iso-lation from significant others, inadequate envi-ronmental stimulation, genetic factors Anxiety (moderate to severe) related to hospital-ization and absence of familiar surroundings Defensive coping related to feelings of powerless-ness and threat to self-esteem Ineffective coping related to inadequate copingskills secondary to developmental delayOutcome Identification Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. The followingcriteria may be used for measurement of outcomes inthe care of the client with intellectual disability. The client: Has experienced no physical harm. Has had self-care needs fulfilled. Interacts with others in a socially appropriate manner. Has maintained anxiety at a manageable level. Is able to accept direction without becoming defensive. Demonstrates adaptive coping skills in response tostressful situations. Planning/Implementation Table 33-2 provides a plan of care for the child withintellectual disability using selected nursing diag-noses, outcome criteria, and appropriate nursing in-terventions and rationales. Although this plan of care is directed toward the individual client, it is essential that family membersor primary caregivers participate in the ongoing careof the client with intellectual disability. They need toreceive information regarding the scope of the con-dition, realistic expectations and client potentials,methods for modifying behavior as required, andcommunity resources from which they may seek assis-tance and support.CHAPTER 33 Children and Adolescents 707 Table 33-2 | CARE PLAN FOR THE CHILD WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY NURSING DIAGNOSIS: RISK FOR INJURY RELATED TO: Altered physical mobility or aggressive behavior OUTCOME CRITERIA NURSING INTERVENTIONS RATIONALE Short- and Long-Term Goal \u0081 Client will not experience injury.1.Create a safe environment for the client. 2.Ensure that small items are re-moved from area where client will be ambulating and that sharpitems are out of reach. 3.Store items that client uses frequently within easy reach. 4.Pad side rails and headboard ofclient with history of seizures. 5.Prevent physical aggression andacting out behaviors by learning to recognize signs that client is becoming ag itated.1 -5.Client safety is a nursing priority.

The nurse reassessesthe plan and makes changes as required. Reassess-ment data may include information gathered by ask-ing the following questions: Have nursing actions providing for the client'ssafety been sufficient to prevent injury? Have all of the client's self-care needs been fulfilled? Can he or she fulfill some of these needsindependently? Has the client been able to communicate needsand desires so that he or she can be understood? Has the client learned to interact appropriatelywith others? When regressive behaviors surface, can the clientaccept constructive feedback and discontinue theinappropriate behavior? Has anxiety been maintained at a manageablelevel? Has the client learned new coping skills throughbehavior modification? Does the client demon-strate evidence of increased self-esteem because ofthe accomplishment of these new skills and adap-tive behaviors?

The diagnosis is adapted to each indi- vidual by clinical specifiers (e.g., level of severity,verbal abilities) and associated features (e.g., knowngenetic disorders, epilepsy, intellectual disability)(APA, 2013). ASD is characterized by a withdrawalof the child into the self and into a fantasy world ofhis or her own creation. The child has markedly ab-normal or impaired development in social interac-tion and communication and a markedly restrictedrepertoire of activity and interests, some of whichmay be considered somewhat bizarre. Epidemiology and Course A study by the Autism and Developmental DisabilitiesMonitoring (ADDM) Network and funded by theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)determined the prevalence of ASD in the UnitedStates to be about 11.3 per 1,000 (1 in 88) children(CDC, 2012b). It occurs about 4.5 times more oftenin boys than in girls. Onset of the disorder occurs inearly childhood, and in most cases it runs a chroniccourse, with symptoms persisting into adulthood. Predisposing Factors Neurological Implications Imaging studies have revealed a number of alterationsin major brain structures of individuals with ASD. Inone recent study, the investigators found a dispropor-tionate enlargement in temporal lobe white matterand an increase in surface area in the temporal,frontal, and parieto-occipital lobes (Hazlett et al.,2011). Other imaging studies have revealed an overallimpairment in brain connectivity networks associatedwith attention, consciousness, and self-awareness(Black & Andreasen, 2011). The role of neurotrans-mitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, and epineph-rine, is currently under investigation. Physiological Implications Ursano, Kartheiser, and Barnhill (2008) listed a num-ber of medical conditions that may be implicated inthe predisposition to ASD. These include tuberoussclerosis, fragile stated, \"In the vast majority ofcases (likely greater than 90 percent), there is noreadily identifiable cause for autism\" (p. 879). Genetics Research has revealed strong evidence that geneticfactors play a significant role in the etiology of ASD.Studies have shown that parents who have one childwith ASD are at increased risk for having more thanone child with the disorder. Other studies with bothmonozygotic and dizygotic twins also have providedCHAPTER 33 Children and Adolescents 709 CORE CONCEPT Autism Spectrum Disorder A disorder that is characterized by impairment in social interaction skills and interpersonal communication anda restricted repertoire of activities and interests (Black& Andreasen, 2011). Autism Spectrum Disorder Clinical Findings In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis- orders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (APA,2000), the category of Autism Spectrum Disordersencompassed a broad spectrum of diagnoses that in-cluded autistic disorder, Rett's disorder, childhooddisintegrative disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, and Asperger's disorder. The DSM-5 groups these disorders into a4092_Ch33_703-746 24/07/14 5:34 PM Page 709evidence of a genetic involvement. Research into how genetic factors influence the development of ASD is ongoing. A number of linkage studieshave implicated areas on several chromosomes in the development of the disorder, most notablychromosomes 2, 7, 15, 16, and 17 (Brkanac,Raskind, & King, 2008; Shriber, 2012; Ursano et al.,2008). The results of a study by the Autism GenomeProject Consortium, which was funded by the U.S.National Institutes of Health, have implicated a re-gion on chromosome 11 and aberrations in a brain-development gene called neurexin 1 (Autism Genome Project Consortium, 2007). The researchers stressthat these findings strongly suggest the need for further study in this area. Perinatal Influences In a study by researchers at Kaiser Permanente inOakland, California, it was found that women whosuffered from asthma and/or allergies around thetime of pregnancy were at increased risk of havinga child affected by ASD (Croen, Grether, Yoshida,Odouli, & Van dewater, 2005). Women with asthmaand allergies recorded during the second trimesterhad a greater than twofold elevated risk of having achild affected by the disorder. The researchers havepostulated that this may be due to maternal im-mune response during pregnancy, or that asthmaand allergy may share environmental risk factorswith ASD. Application of the Nursing Process to Autism Spectrum Disorder Background Assessment Data (Symptomatology) The symptomatology presented here is common among children with ASD. This information, as wellas knowledge about predisposing factors associatedwith the disorder, is important in creating an accurateplan of care for the client. Because ASD is a spectrumdisorder, the symptomatology described here wouldbe observed on a degree-of-gravity continuum frommild to more severe. Impairment in Social Interaction Children with ASD have difficulty forming interpersonal relationshipswith others. They show little interest in people andoften do not respond to others' attempts at interac-tion. As infants they may have an aversion to affectionand physical contact. As toddlers, the attachment toa significant adult may be either absent or manifestedas exaggerated adherence behaviors. In childhood,there is failure to develop cooperative play, imagina- tive play , and friendships. Those children with mini- mal handicaps may eventually progress to the pointof recognizing other children as part of their environ-ment, if only in a passive manner.Impairment in Communication and Imaginative ActivityBoth verbal and nonverbal skills are affected. Lan-guage may be totally absent or characterized by im-mature structure or idiosyncratic utterances whosemeaning is clear only to those who are familiar withthe child's past experiences. Nonverbal communica- tion, such as facial expression or gestures, is often ab-sent or socially inappropriate. The pattern ofimaginative play is often restricted and stereotypical. Restricted Activities and Inter ests Even minor changes in the environment are often met with resistance or sometimes with hysterical responses. Attachment to,or extreme fascination with, objects that move or spin(e.g., fans) is common. Routine may become an ob-session, with minor alterations in routine leading tomarked distress. Stereotyped body movements (hand-clapping, rocking, whole-body swaying) and verbaliza-tions (repetition of words or phrases) are typical. Dietabnormalities may include eating only a few specificfoods or consuming an excessive amount of fluids. Behaviors that are self-injurious, such as head bang-ing or biting the hands or arms, may be evident. The DSM -5diagnostic criteria for ASD are pre- sented in Box 33-2. The criteria specify a range of behaviors, thus addressing the spectrum of sympto-matology associated with this diagnosis. Nursing Diagnosis Based on data collected during the nursing assess-ment, possible nursing diagnoses for the client withASD include the following: Risk for self-mutilation related to neurological alterations; history of self-mutilative behaviors; hys-terical reactions to changes in the environment Impaired social interaction related to inability totrust; neurological alterations, evidenced by lack ofresponsiveness to, or interest in, people Impaired verbal communication related to with-drawal into the self; neurological alterations, evi-denced by inability or unwillingness to speak; lackof nonverbal expression Disturbed personal identity related to neurologicalalterations; delayed developmental stage, evi-denced by difficulty separating own physiologicaland emotional needs and personal boundariesfrom those of others Outcome Identification Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. The followingcriteria may be used for measurement of outcomes inthe care of the client with ASD. The client: Exhibits no evidence of self-harm. Interacts appropriately with at least one staff member.710 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch33_703-746 24/07/14 5:34 PM Page 710Demonstrates trust in at least one staff member. Is able to communicate so that he or she can be un- derstood by at least one staff member. Demonstrates behaviors that indicate he or she hasbegun the separation/individuation process. Planning/Implementation Table 33-3 provides a plan of care for the child with ASD,including selected nursing diagnoses, outcome criteria,and appropriate nursing interventions and rationales. Evaluation Evaluation of care for the child with ASD reflectswhether the nursing actions have been effective inachieving the established goals. The nursing processcalls for reassessment of the plan. Questions forgathering reassessment data may include the following: Has the child been able to establish trust with atleast onecaregiver? Have the nursing actions directed toward prevent-ing mutilative behaviors been effective in protect-ing the client from self-harm? Has the child attempted to interact with others?Has he or she received positive reinforcement forthese efforts? Has eye contact improved?CHAPTER 33 Children and Adolescents 711 BOX 33-2 Diagnostic Criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder A. Persistent deficits in social communication and social in- teraction across multiple contexts, as manifested by the following, currently or by history (examples are illustra-tive, not exhaustive): 1. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, ranging, for ex- ample, from abnormal social approach and failure ofnormal back-and-forth conversation; to reduced shar-ing of interests, emotions, or affect; to failure to initiateor respond to social interactions. 2. Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, ranging, for example, from poorlyintegrated verbal and nonverbal communication; to ab-normalities in eye contact and body language or deficitsin understanding and use of gestures; to a total lack offacial expressions and nonverbal communication. 3. Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships, ranging, for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts; to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in makingfriends; to absence of interest in peers. Specify current severity: Severity is based on social communication impair- ments and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior. B. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, as manifested by at least two of the following,currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive): 1. Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of ob- jects, or speech (e.g., simple motor stereotypies, liningup toys or flipping objects, echolalia, idiosyncraticphrases). 2. sameness, inflexible adherence to or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal be-havior (e.g., extreme distress at small changes,difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns,greeting rituals, need to take same route or eat samefood every day). 3. Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g., strong attachment to or pre-occupation with unusual objects, excessively circum-scribed or perseverative interests). 4. Hyper- or hypo-reactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of environment (e.g., ap-parent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse re-sponse to specific sounds or textures, excessivesmelling or touching of objects, visual fascination withlights or movement).

Psychopharmacological Intervention for ASD The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two medications for the treatment ofirritability associated with ASD: risperidone (Risperdal;in children and adolescents 5 to 16 years) and aripipra-zole (Abilify; in children and adolescents 6 to 17 years).The behavior symptoms for which these medicationsare targeted include: Aggression Deliberate self-injury Temper tantrums Quickly changing moods Dosage of risperidone for ASD is based on weight of the child and the clinical response. In clinical 4092_Ch33_703-746 24/07/14 5:34 PM Page 713trials, children weighing between 15 and 45 kg received 2.5 mg per day, and those weighing morethan 45 kg received 3.5 mg per day. The most com-mon side effects were drowsiness, mild to moderateincrease in appetite, nasal congestion, fatigue, con-stipation, drooling, dizziness, and weight gain. Al-though some reports of \"abnormal movements\"were described, no cases of tardive dyskinesia werereported in clinical studies (Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology Autism Network,2002, 2005). When administering risperidone, cau-tion must be maintained concerning less commonbut more serious possible side effects, includingneuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia,hyperglycemia, and diabetes. In clinical studies with aripiprazole, the most fre- quently reported adverse events included sedation,fatigue, weight gain, vomiting, somnolence, andtremor. The most common reasons for discontinua-tion of aripiprazole were sedation, drooling, tremor,vomiting, and extrapyramidal disorder. Dosage with aripiprazole for irritability in ASD is initiated at 2 mg/day. Dosage may be increased by5 mg/day at intervals of no less than 1 week, up to amaximum of 15 mg/day. The efficacy of maintenancetherapy with aripiprazole has not been evaluated, andclients should be periodically reassessed to determinethe need for continued treatment.of the cases, ADHD persists into young adulthood,and about 25 percent will subsequently meet the cri-teria for antisocial personality disorder as adults(Black & Andreasen, 2011). In making the diagnosis of ADHD, the DSM-5 criteria are further specified according to current clinical pres-entation. These subtypes include a combined presenta-tion (meeting the criteria for both inattention andhyperactivity/impulsivity), a predominantly inattentivepresentation, and a predominantly hyperactive/impulsivepresentation. Predisposing Factors Biological Influences Genetics A number of studies have revealed support-ive evidence of genetic influences in the etiology ofADHD. Results have indicated that a large number of parents of hyperactive children showed signs of hyperactivity during their own childhood; that hyper-active children are more likely than other children tohave siblings who are also hyperactive; and that whenone twin of an identical twin pair has the disorder, theother is likely to have it too (Kollins, 2008). Adoptionstudies reveal that biological parents of children withADHD have more psychopathology than the adoptiveparents. One research study of genetic evidence for ADHD found copy number variants on a specific region of chromosome 16 (Williams et al., 2010). The re-searchers also found that copy number variants over-lap with chromosomal regions previously linked toASD and schizophrenia. Biochemical Theory Although it is believed that certain neurotransmitters\u2014particularly dopamine, norepi-nephrine, and possibly serotonin\u2014are involved inproducing the symptoms associated with ADHD, theirinvolvement is still under investigation. Abnormal levels of these neurotransmitters may be associatedwith the symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity , impulsivity, mood, and aggression often observed in individuals with the disorder (Faraone, 2006; Hunt,2006). (See Fig. 33-1). Anatomical Influences Some studies have implicated alterations in specific areas of the brain in individualswith ADHD. These regions include the prefrontal714 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations CORE CONCEPT Hyperactivity Excessive psychomotor activity that may be purposeful or aimless, accompanied by physical movements andverbal utterances that are usually more rapid than normal. Inattention and distractibility are common withhyperactive behavior. CORE CONCEPT Impulsiveness The trait of acting without reflection and without thought to the consequences of the behavior. Anabrupt inclination to act (and the inability to resist act-ing) on certain behavioral urges. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Clinical Findings, Epidemiology, and Course The essential behavior pattern of a child with atten- tion-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one ofinattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity. These children are highly distractible and unable tocontain their responses to stimuli. Motor activity is ex-cessive, and movements are random and impulsive.Onset of the disorder is difficult to diagnose in chil-dren younger than age 4 years because their charac-teristic behavior is much more variable than that ofolder children. Frequently the disorder is not recog-nized until the child enters school. It is more com-mon in boys than in girls by a ratio of approximately3:1 and may occur in as many as 9 percent of school-age children (CDC, 2011). In about 60 to 70 percent4092_Ch33_703-746 24/07/14 5:34 PM Page 714CHAPTER 33 Children and Adolescents 715 NEUROTRANSMITTERS The major neurotransmitters implicated in the pathophysiology of ADHD are dopamine, norepinephrine, and possibly serotonin. Dopamine and norepinephrine appear to be depleted in ADHD. Serotonin in ADHD has been studied less extensively, but recent evidence suggests that it also is reduced in children with ADHD. NEUROTRANSMITTER FUNCTIONS \u0081 Norepinephrine is thought to play a role in the ability to perform executive functions, such as analysis and reasoning, and in the cognitive alertness essential for processing stimuli and sustaining attention and thought (Hunt, 2006). \u0081 Dopamine is thought to play a role in sensory filtering, memory, concentration, controlling emotions, locomotor activity, and reasoning.\u0081 Deficits in norepinephrine and dopamine have both been implicated in the inattention, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity associa ted with ADHD. \u0081 Serotonin appears to play a role in ADHD, although possibly less significant than norepinephrine and dopamine. It has been suggested that alterations in serotonin may be related to the disinhibition and impulsivity observed in children with ADHD. It may play a role in mood disorders, particularly depression, which is a common comorbid disorder associated with ADHD. FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF THE BRAIN AFFECTED \u0081Prefrontal cortex: Associated with maintaining attention, organization, and executive function. Also serves to modulate behavior inhibition, with serotonin as the predominant central inhibiting neurotransmitter for this function. \u0081Basal ganglia (particularly the caudate nucleus and globus pallidus): Involved in the regulation of high-level movements. In association with its connecting circuits to the prefrontal cortex, may also be important in cognition. Interruptions in these c ircuits may result in inattention or impulsivity. \u0081Hippocampus: Plays an important role in learning and memory. \u0081Limbic system (composed of of emotions. A neurotransmitter deficiency in this area may result in restlessness, inattention, or emotional volatility. \u0081Reticular activating system (composed of the reticular formation [located in the brain stem] and its connections): It is the major relay system among the many pathways that enter and leave the brain. It is thought to be the center of arousal and motivation a nd is crucial for maintaining a state of consciousness. of norepinephrine from central noradrenergic neurons. At higher doses, dopamine may be released in the mesolimbic system. \u0081 Methylphenidate and dexmethylphenidate: block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into 2008). Prenatal, Perinatal, and Postnatal Factors Maternal smoking during pregnancy has been linked to hy- perkinetic-impulsive behavior in offspring (Linnetet al., 2005; Rizwan, Manning, & Brabin, 2007). In-trauterine exposure to toxic substances, includingalcohol, can produce effects on behavior. Fetal alcohol syndrome includes hyperactivity, impulsiv-ity, and inattention, as well as physical anomalies(see Chapter 23). Perinatal influences that may contribute to ADHD are prematurity or low birth weight, signs of fetal distress, precipitated or prolonged labor, and perina-tal asphyxia and low Apgar scores (Bhat, Grizenko, Ben-Amor, & Joober, 2005). Postnatal factors that havebeen implicated include cerebral palsy, seizures, andother central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities re-sulting from trauma, infections, or other neurologicaldisorders (Ben-Amor et al., 2005; Popper, Gammon,West, & Bailey, 2003). Environmental Influences Environmental Lead Studies continue to provide evidence of the adverse effects of elevated body levels of lead on cognitive and behavioral develop-ment in children (Braun, hasplaced tighter restrictions on the substance in recentyears, making exposure to toxic levels less prevalentthan it once was. However, reports indicate that atleast 4 million households in the United States have children living in them who are being exposed tolead, and that approximately 500,000 U.S. childrenages 1 to 5 have blood lead levels above 5 micro-grams per deciliter, the reference level at which theinitiation of public health actions are recommended(CDC, 2012a).Diet Factors The possible link between food dyes andadditives, such as artificial flavorings and preserva- tives, was introduced in the mid-1970s. Studies on theeffect of food and food-additive allergies remain con-troversial, largely because of the inconsistencies in theresults. Striking improvement in behavior has beenreported by some parents and teachers when hyper-active children are placed on a diet free of dyes andadditives. Researchers in Great Britain reported on astudy that revealed significant hyperactive behavior in3-, 8-, and 9-year -old children who were given fruit drinks with food additives compared with childrenwho received a placebo drink (McCann et al., 2007).Further study in this area is still required. Another diet factor that has received much attention in its possible link to ADHD is sugar. A number of stud-ies have been conducted in an effort to determine theeffect of sugar on hyperactive behavior, and the resultsstrongly suggest that sugar plays no role in hyperactivity. Psychosocial Influences Disorganized or chaotic environments or a disruptionin family equilibrium may contribute to ADHD insome individuals. A high degree of psychosocial stress,maternal mental disorder, paternal criminality, low so-cioeconomic status, living in poverty, growing up in aninstitution, and unstable foster care have been shownto increase the risk of ADHD in predisposed individu-als (Dopheide & Pliszka, 2009; Voeller, 2004). Application of the Nursing Process to ADHD Background Assessment Data (Symptomatology) A major portion of the hyperactive child's problemsrelate to difficulties in performing age-appropriatetasks. Hyperactive children are highly distractibleand have extremely limited attention spans. Theyoften shift from one uncompleted activity to another.Impulsivity, or deficit in inhibitory control, is alsocommon.716 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations Side effects of CNS stimulants include restlessness, insomnia, headache, palpitations, weight loss, suppression of growth in ch ildren (with long-term use), increased blood pressure, abdominal pain, anxiety, tolerance, and physical and psychological dependence. Others \u0081 Atomoxatine: selectively inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine by blocking the presynaptic transporter. Side effects include headache, upper abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, cough, dry mouth, constipation, increase in heart rate and blood pressure, and fatigue. \u0081 Bupropion: inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into presynaptic neurons. Side effects include headache, dizziness, insomnia or sedation, tachycardia, increased blood pressure, dry mouth, nausea and vomiting, weight gain or loss, and seizures (dose dependent).\u0081 Alpha agonists (clonidine, guanfacine): stimulate central alpha-adrenoreceptors in the brain resulting in reduced sympathetic outflow from the CNS. Side effects include palpitations, bradycardia, constipation, dry mouth, and sedation.4092_Ch33_703-746 24/07/14 5:34 716CHAPTER 33 Children and Adolescents 717 BOX 33-3 Diagnostic Criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder A. A persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity- impulsivity that interferes with functioning or develop- ment, as characterized by (1) and/or (2):1.Inattention: Six (or more) of the following symptoms have persisted for at least 6 months to a degree thatis inconsistent with developmental level and that neg-atively impacts directly on social and academic/occu-pational activities. Note: The symptoms are not solely a manifestation of oppositional behavior, defiance,hostility, or failure to understand tasks or instructions.For older adolescents and adults (age 17 and older),at least five symptoms are required. a. Often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work,or during other activities (e.g., overlooks or missesdetails, work is inaccurate). b. Often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities (e.g., has difficulty remaining focusedduring lectures, conversations, or reading lengthyreading). c. Often does not seem to listen when spoken to di- rectly (e.g., mind seems elsewhere, even in theabsence of any obvious distraction). d. Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in theworkplace (e.g., starts tasks but quickly loses focusand is easily sidetracked). e. Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities (e.g., difficulty managing sequential tasks; difficultykeeping materials and belongings in order; messy,disorganized, work; has poor time management;fails to meet deadlines). f. Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort (e.g.,schoolwork or homework; for older adolescentsand adults, preparing reports, completing forms,reviewing lengthy papers). g. Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities (e.g., school materials, pencils, books, tools, wallets,keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, or mobile telephones). h. Is often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli (for older adolescents and adults, may include unre-lated thoughts). i. Is often forgetful in daily activities (e.g., chores, run- ning errands; for older adolescents and adults, returning calls, paying bills, keeping appointments).2.Hyperactivity and Impulsivity: Six (or more) of thefollowing symptoms have persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is inconsistent with de-velopmental level and that negatively impacts di-rectly on social and academic/occupational activities.Note: The symptoms are not solely a manifestation of oppositional behavior, defiance, hostility, or a fail-ure to understand tasks or instructions. For olderadolescents and adults (age 17 and older), at leastfive symptoms are required. a. Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet or squirms in seat. b. Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected (e.g., leaves his or her placein the classroom, in the office or other workplace,or in other situations that require remaining inplace). c. Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is inappropriate. (Note: In adolescents or adults, may be limited to feeling restless). d. Often unable to play or engage in leisure activities quietly. e. Is often \"on the go,\" acting as if \"driven by a motor\" (e.g., is unable to be or uncomfortable being stillfor extended time, as in restaurants, meetings; maybe experienced by others as being restless and difficult to keep up with). f. Often talks excessively. g. Often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed (e.g., completes people's sen-tences; cannot wait for turn in conversation). h. Often has difficulty waiting his or her turn (e.g., while waiting in line). i. Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations, games, or activities; may startusing other people's things without asking or re-ceiving permission; for adolescents or adults, mayintrude into or take over what others are doing). B. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present prior to age 12 years. C. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are present in two or more settings (e.g., at home, schoolor work; with friends or relatives; in other activities). D. There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with or reduce the quality of social, academic, or occupationalfunctioning.Hyperactive children have difficulty forming satis- factory interpersonal relationships. They demonstrate behaviors that inhibit acceptable social interaction.They are disruptive and intrusive in group endeavors.They have difficulty complying with social norms.Some children with ADHD are very aggressive or op-positional, whereas others exhibit more regressiveand immature behaviors. Low frustration toleranceand outbursts of temper are common.Children with ADHD have boundless energy, ex- hibiting excessive levels of activity, restlessness, andfidgeting. They have been described as \"perpetual motion machines,\" continuously running, jumping, wiggling, or squirming. They experience a greater thanaverage number of accidents, from minor mishaps tomore serious incidents that may lead to physical injuryor the destruction of property. The DSM- 5diagnostic criteria for ADHD are presented in Box 33-3. 24/07/14 5:34 PM Page 717Comorbidity The prevalence of comorbid psychiatric disorders with ADHD may be as high as 84 percent(Ferguson-Noyes & Wilkinson, 2008). Those com-monly identified include oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder , anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and substance abuse. It is extremely important to identify and treat any comorbid psychiatric conditionsin a child with ADHD. In some instances, as with anxiety and depression, the comorbid disorders maybe treated concurrently with the symptoms of ADHD.Jenson (2005) suggests that comorbid depression andADHD may respond to bupropion or atomoxetine asa single agent, and individuals with comorbid anxietyand ADHD may benefit from treatment with atomox-etine (Dopheide & Pliszka, 2009). Other disorders may require separate treatment. Wilens and Upadhyaya (2007) state, \"In patientswith coexisting substance use disorders and ADHD,the priority is to stabilize the addiction before treat-ing the ADHD.\" Because stimulants can exacerbatemania, it is suggested that medication for ADHD beinitiated only after bipolar symptoms have beencontrolled with a mood stabilizer (Dopheide &Pliszka, 2009). Types of conditions often seen withADHD and their rate of comorbidity are presentedin Table 33-4. Nursing Diagnosis Based on the data collected during the nursing assess-ment, possible nursing diagnoses for the child withADHD include the following: Risk for injury related to impulsive and accident-prone behavior and the inability to perceive self-harm Impaired social interaction related to intrusive andimmature behavior Low self-esteem related to dysfunctional family system and negative feedbackNoncompliance with task expectations related tolow frustration tolerance and short attention span Outcome Identification Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. The followingcriteria may be used for measurement of outcomes inthe care of the child with ADHD. The client: Has experienced no physical harm. Interacts with others appropriately. Verbalizes positive aspects about self. Demonstrates fewer demanding behaviors. Cooperatives with staff in an effort to complete as-signed tasks.

Concept Care Mapping The concept map care plan is an innovative ap-proach to planning and organizing nursing care (seeChapter 9). It is a diagrammatic teaching and learn-ing strategy that allows visualization of interrelation-ships between medical diagnoses, nursing diagnoses,assessment data, and treatments. An example of aconcept map care plan for a client with ADHD ispresented in Figure 33-2.Evaluation Evaluation of the care of a client with ADHD involvesexamining client behaviors following implementationof the nursing actions to determine if the goals oftherapy have been achieved. Collecting data by usingthe following types of questions may provide appro-priate information for evaluation. Have the nursing actions directed at client safetybeen effective in protecting the child from injury? Has the child been able to establish a trusting rela-tionship with the primary caregiver?

He is unable to sit still, and is constantly moving and running around the unit. In the short time since his admission, he has hit another patient, knocked over and broken a lamp, and yelled at the nurse, \"I don't have to mind you! Y ou're not the boss!\" He became frustrated and left the occupational therapy group when he was having difficulty with the project. He denies any responsibility and blames others for his actions. He ridicules the other patients and calls them insulting names. The nurse develops the following concept map care plan for Andy.

Psychopharmacological Intervention for ADHD Indications Examples of commonly used agents for ADHD arepresented in Table 33-6. The medications discussedin this section are used for ADHD in children andadults. Amphetamines are also used 721722 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations TABLE 33-6 Medications for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder DAILY DOSAGE CONTROLLED PREGNANCY CATEGORIES/ CHEMICAL CLASS GENERIC (TRADE) NAME RANGE (mg) CATEGORIES HALF-LIFE (hr) CNS STIMULANTS Amphetamines Amphetamine used in the treatment of major depression and for smoking cessation (Zyban only). Clonidine and guan-facine are used to treat hypertension. Action CNS stimulants increase levels of neurotransmitters(probably norepinephrine, dopamine, and CNS. They produce CNS and respiratory stimu-lation, dilated pupils, increased motor activity and mental alertness, diminished sense of fatigue, andbrighter spirits. The CNS stimulants discussed in and dexmethylphenidate. inthe treatment of ADHD is unclear. However, recent re-search indicates that their effectiveness in the treatmentof hyperactivity disorders is based on the activation ofdopamine D4 receptors in the basal ganglia and thala-mus, which depress, rather than enhance, motor activ-ity (Erlij et al, 2012). Atomoxetine inhibits the reuptake and dopamine. Clonidineand guanfacine stimulate central alpha-adrenorecep-tors in the brain resulting in reduced sympathetic out-flow from the CNS. The exact mechanism by whichthese nonstimulant drugs produce the therapeutic ef-fect in ADHD to Theyshould not be used in advanced car-diovascular disease, hypertension, hyperthyroidism,glaucoma, agitated or hyperexcitability states; inclients with a history of drug abuse; during or within14 days of receiving therapy with monoamine oxidaseinhibitors (MAOIs); in children younger than 3 yearsof in pregnancy and lactation. Atomoxetineand bupropion are contraindicated in clients with hy-persensitivity to the drugs or their components; in lac-tation; and in concomitant use with, or within 2 weeksof using MAOIs. Atomoxetine with known or sus- pected seizure disorder, in the acute phase of myocar-dial infarction, and in clients with bulimia or anorexianervosa. Alpha agonists are contraindicated in clientswith known hypersensitivity to the drugs. Caution is advised in using CNS stimulants in chil- dren with psychosis; in Tourette's disorder; anorexia or insomnia; in elderly, debilitated, or as-thenic clients; and in clients with a history of suicidalor homicidal tendencies. Prolonged use may result intolerance and physical or psychological dependence.Atomoxetine and bupropion should be used cautiouslyin clients elderly and debilitated clients. Alpha ago-nists should be used with caution in clients withcoronary insufficiency, recent myocardial infarction, orcerebrovascular disease; in chronic renal hepaticfailure; in and in pregnancy and lactation. Interactions CNS Stimulants (Amphetamines) Effects of with or urinary alkalinizers. Hypertensive crisis may occur with con-comitant use of (and up to several weeks after discon-tinuing) MAOIs. Increased risk of serotonin syndromeoccurs with coadministration serotonin reuptake Methylphenidate antihypertensive pressor agents (e.g., dopamine, epinephrine, phenylephrine) are de-creased with concomitant occur withcoadministration of MAOIs. Atomoxetine Effects of atomoxetine are increased with P450 isozyme2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxe-tine, quinidine). Potentially fatal reactions mayoccur with concurrent use of (or within 2 weeks ofdiscontinuation of) MAOIs. Risk of cardiovasculareffects is increased with concomitant use of albuterolor vasopressors. Bupropion Effects of bupropion are increased with amantadine, or ritonavir. Effects of bupropion are decreased with carbamazepine. There is increasedrisk of acute toxicity with MAOIs. Increased risk of hy-pertension may occur with nicotine replacement agents,and adverse neuropsychiatric events may occur with alcohol. Increased anticoagulant effects of warfarin, aswell as increased effects Agonists Synergistic pharmacologic and toxic effects, possibly causing atrioventricular (AV) block, bradycardia, and severe hypotension, may occur withconcomitant use of calcium blockers or and sedative/hypnotics. Effects of clonidinemay be decreased with concomitant use of tricyclicantidepressants and prazosin. Decreased effects of lev-odopa may occur with clonidine, and effects of guan-facine are decreased with barbiturates or phenytoin. Side Effects The plan of care should include monitoring for thefollowing side effects from agents for ADHD. Nursingimplications related to each side effect are designatedby an asterisk (*). Overstimulation, restlessness, insomnia (with CNSstimulants) *Assess mental status for changes in mood, level of activity, degree of stimulation, and aggressiveness. *Ensure that the client is protected from injury.*Keep stimuli low and environment as quiet as pos- sible to discourage overstimulation. *To prevent insomnia, administer the last dose at least 6 hours before bedtime. Administer sus-tained-release forms in the morning. record vital signs at regular inter- vals (two or three times a day) throughout ther-apy. Report significant changes to the physicianimmediately. NOTE: The FDA has issued warnings associated with CNS stimulants and atomoxetine of the riskfor sudden death in patients who have cardiovas-cular disease. A careful personal and family historyof heart disease, heart defects, or hypertensionshould be obtained before these medications areprescribed. Careful monitoring of cardiovascularfunction during administration must be ongoing. Anorexia, weight loss (with CNS stimulants, atom-oxetine, and bupropion) *To reduce anorexia, the medication may be admin- istered immediately after meals. The client shouldbe weighed regularly (at least weekly) when receiv-ing therapy with CNS stimulants, atomoxetine, orCHAPTER 7234092_Ch33_703-746 24/07/14 5:34 PM Page 723bupropion because of the potential for anorexia and weight loss, and temporary interruption ofgrowth and development. Tolerance, physical and psychological dependence(with CNS stimulants) *Tolerance develops rapidly.*In children with ADHD, a drug \"holiday\" should be attempted periodically under the supervisionof the physician to determine the effectiveness ofthe medication and the need for continuation. *The drug should not be withdrawn abruptly. To do so could initiate the following syndrome ofsymptoms: nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramp-ing, headache, fatigue, weakness, mental depres-sion, suicidal ideation, increased dreaming, andpsychotic behavior. Nausea and vomiting (with atomoxetine andbupropion) *May be taken with food to minimize Constipation (with atomoxetine, bupropion, cloni-dine, and guanfacine) *Increase fiber and fluid in diet, if not contraindi- cated. Dry mouth (with clonidine and guanfacine) *Offer the client sugarless candy, ice, frequent sips of water. *Strict oral hygiene is very important. Sedation (with clonidine and guanfacine) *Warn client that this effect is increased by con- comitant use of alcohol and other CNS drugs. *Warn clients to refrain from driving or performing hazardous tasks until response has been established. Potential for seizures (with bupropion) *Protect client from injury if seizure should occur. Instruct family and significant others of clientson bupropion therapy how to protect client dur-ing a seizure if one should occur. Ensure thatdoses of the immediate release medication areadministered at least 4 to 6 hours apart anddoses of the sustained release medication at least8 hours apart. Severe liver damage (with atomoxetine) *Monitor for the following side effects and report to physician immediately: itching, dark urine,right upper quadrant pain, yellow skin or eyes,sore throat, fever, malaise. New or worsened psychiatric symptoms (with CNSstimulants and atomoxetine) *Monitor for psychotic symptoms (e.g., hearing voices, paranoid behaviors, delusions). *Monitor for manic symptoms, including aggressive and hostile behaviors. Rebound syndrome (with clonidine and guanfacine) *Client should be instructed not to discontinue therapy abruptly. To do so may result in symptomsof nervousness, agitation, headache, tremor, anda rapid rise in blood pressure. Dosage should betapered gradually under the supervision of thephysician. Tourette's Disorder Clinical Findings, Epidemiology, and Course Tourette's disorder is characterized by the presenceof multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics,which may appear simultaneously or at different peri-ods during the illness (APA, 2013). The disturbancemay cause distress or interfere with social, occupational,or other important areas of functioning. The age atonset of Tourette's disorder can be as early as 2 years,but the disorder occurs most commonly during child-hood (around age 6 to 7 years). Prevalence of the disorder is estimated at from 3 to 8 per 1,000 inschool-age children (APA, 2013). It is more commonin boys than in girls. Although the disorder can belifelong, the symptoms usually diminish during ado-lescence and adulthood, and in some cases, disappearaltogether by early adulthood (Leckman, Bloch, Scahill, & King, 2006). Predisposing Factors Biological Factors Genetics Tics are noted in two-thirds of relatives ofTo urette's disorder clients (Popper et al., 2003). Twin studies with both monozygotic and dizygotic twinssuggest an inheritable component. Evidence suggeststhat Tourette's disorder may be transmitted in an au-tosomal pattern intermediate between dominant andrecessive (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Singer, Leffler,and Murray (2008) state: The precise gene and mechanism of inheritance re- main undetermined. A complex genetic mechanismis likely, perhaps one associated with multiple genesor an epigenetic effect, i.e., an environmental expo-sure influencing gene expression. Biochemical Factors Abnormalities in levels of dopamine, serotonin, dynorphin, gamma-aminobutyric a cid (GABA), acetylcholine, and norepinephrine have with Tourette's disorder al., Neurotransmitter pathways through the basal ganglia,globus pallidus, and subthalamic regions appear to be involved. Structural Factors Neuroimaging brain studies have been consistent in finding dysfunction in the area of the basal ganglia. One study found a correlation be-tween smaller size of corpus callosum and To urette's disorder in children (Plessen et al., 2007). Petersonand associates (2007) found larger volumes in subre-gions of the hippocampus and amygdala in childrenwith Tourette's Special Populations4092_Ch33_703-746 24/07/14 5:34 PM Page 724CHAPTER 33 Children and Adolescents 725 Environmental Factors Additional retrospective findings may be implicated in the etiology of Tourette's disorder. Complicationsof pregnancy (e.g., severe nausea and vomiting or ex-cessive stress), low birth weight, head trauma, carbonmonoxide poisoning, and encephalitis are thought tobe associated with the onset of nongenetic Tourette'sdisorder. Tourette's disorder may also arise as a resultof a postinfection autoimmune phenomenon in-duced by childhood streptococcal infection (Black &Andreasen, 2011). Application of the Nursing Process to Tourette's Disorder Background Assessment Data (Symptomatology) The motor tics of Tourette's disorder may involve the head, torso, and upper and lower limbs. Initial symp-toms may begin with a single motor tic, most commonlyeye blinking, or with multiple symptoms. Simple motortics include movements such as eye blinking, neck jerking, shoulder shrugging, and facial grimacing. Themore complex motor tics include squatting, hopping,skipping, tapping, and retracing steps. Vocal tics include various words or sounds such as squeaks, grunts, barks, sniffs, snorts, coughs and, in rare instances, a complex vocal tic involving theuttering of obscenities. Vocal tics may include repeat-ing certain words or phrases out of context, repeat-ing one's own sounds or words (palilalia), orrepeating what others say (echolalia). The movements and vocalizations are experienced as compulsive and irresistible, but they can be sup-pressed for varying lengths of time. They are exacer-bated by stress and attenuated during periods inwhich the individual becomes totally absorbed by anactivity. In most cases, tics are diminished duringsleep (Singer et al., 2008). Comorbid disorders common with Tourette's dis- order include ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder,depression, and anxiety. Episodic andschool difficulties may also be observed. In severecases, self-injurious behaviors may be exhibited(Singer et al., 2008). The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for Tourette's disor- der are presented in Box 33-4. Nursing Diagnosis Based on data collected during the nursing assess-ment, possible nursing diagnoses for the client withTourette's disorder include the following: Risk for self-directed or other-directed violence re-lated to low tolerance for frustration Impaired social interaction related to impulsive-ness and oppositional and aggressive behaviorLow self-esteem related to embarrassment associ-ated with tic behaviors Outcome Identification Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. The followingcriteria may be used for measurement of outcomes inthe care of the client with Tourette's disorder. The client: Has not harmed self or others. Interacts with staff and peers in an appropriatemanner. Demonstrates self-control by managing tic behavior. Follows rules of the unit without becoming defensive. Verbalizes positive aspects about self. Planning/Implementation Table 33-7 provides a plan of care for the child or ado-lescent with Tourette's disorder using selected nurs-ing diagnoses, outcome criteria, and appropriatenursing interventions and rationales. Evaluation Evaluation of care for the child with Tourette's disor-der reflects whether or not the nursing actions havebeen effective in achieving the established goals. Thenursing process calls for reassessment of the plan.Questions for gathering reassessment data may in-clude the following: Has the client refrained from causing harm to selfor others during times of increased tension? Has the client developed adaptive coping strategiesfor dealing with frustration to prevent resorting toself-destruction or aggression to others? Is the client able to interact appropriately with staffand peers? Is the client able to suppress tic behaviors when heor she chooses to do so?BOX 33-4 Diagnostic Criteria for Tourette's Disorder A. Both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics have been present at some time during the illness, although not necessarily concurrently. B. The tics may wax and wane in frequency but have per- sisted for more than 1 year since first tic onset. C. Onset is before age 18 years.D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., cocaine) or another medicalcondition (e.g., Huntington's disease, postviral encephalitis).

Does the client verbalize positive aspects about self,particularly as they relate to his or her ability tomanage the illness? Does the client comply with treatment in a nonde-fensive manner? Psychopharmacological Intervention for Tourette's Disorder Pharmacotherapy is often not recommended to treat Tourette's disorder unless it is causing significantfunctional impairment or physical discomfort, or isinterfering with the individual's overall quality of life or psychological adjustment (Singer et al., 2008;Ursano et al., 2008). Pharmacotherapy is most effec-tive when it is combined with psychosocial therapy,such as behavioral therapy, individual counseling orpsychotherapy, and/or family therapy. Medicationsthat are used in the treatment of Tourette's disorderinclude (Orap), have been approved by theFDA for control of tics and vocal utterances associatedwith Tourette's disorder. These drugs have beenwidely investigated and have proved to be highly effective in alleviating these symptoms. They are oftennot the first-line choice of therapy, however, becauseof their propensity for severe adverse effects, such asextrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), neuroleptic malig-nant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, and electrocardio-graphic changes. Haloperidol is not recommendedfor children younger than 3 years of age, and pi-mozide should not be administered to childrenyounger than 12 years. Although not presently approved by the FDA for use in Tourette's disorder, some clinicians prefer toprescribe the because of profiles. In clinical trials, these medications4092_Ch33_703-746 24/07/14 5:34 PM Page 727have been shown to be effective in treating the symp- toms of Tourette's disorder. These medications have alower incidence of neurological side effects than thetypical antipsychotics, although EPS has been observedwith risperidone. Common side effects include weightgain and sedation. Ziprasidone has been associatedwith increased risk of QTc interval prolongation. Hyperglycemia has also been reported in as antihypertensive agents. The extended-releaseforms have been approved by the FDA for the treat-ment of ADHD. These medications are often thefirst-line choice for treatment of Tourette's disorderbecause of their favorable side-effect profile and because they are often effective for comorbid symp-toms of ADHD, anxiety, and insomnia (Zinner,2004). Common side effects include dry mouth, sedation, headaches, fatigue, and dizziness or pos-tural hypotension. Guanfacine lasting andless sedating than clonidine. agonists shouldnot be prescribed for children and adolescents withpre-existing cardiac or vascular disease. They shouldnot be discontinued abruptly; to do so could resultin symptoms of nervousness, agitation, tremor, anda rapid rise in blood pressure. Disruptive Behavior Disorders Oppositional Defiant Disorder Clinical Findings, Epidemiology, and Course Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is characterizedby a persistent pattern of angry mood and defiant behavior that occurs more frequently than is usuallyobserved in individuals of comparable age and devel-opmental level, and interferes with social, educa-tional, occupational, or other important areas offunctioning (APA, 2013). The disorder typically be-gins by 8 years of age and usually not later than earlyadolescence. Prevalence estimates range from 2 to 12 percent, and common comorbid disorders includeADHD and anxiety and mood disorders (Ursano et al., 2008). It is more prevalent in boys than in girlsbefore puberty, but the rates are more closely equalafter puberty. In some cases of ODD, there may be aprogression to conduct disorder (Lubit, 2011). Predisposing Factors Biological Influences What role, if any, genetics, temperament, or biochem-ical alterations play in the etiology of ODD is still beinginvestigated. A study by Comings and associates (2000)suggests the genes for metabolism of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine may be contributing factors in the development of ODD. Family Influences Opposition during various developmental stages isboth normal and healthy. Children first exhibit oppositional behaviors at around 10 or 11 monthsof age, again as toddlers between 18 and 36 monthsof age, and finally during adolescence. Pathology isconsidered only when the developmental phase isprolonged, or when there is overreaction in thechild's environment to his or her behavior. Some children exhibit these behaviors in a more intense form than others. Sadock and Sadock (2007)report, \"Epidemiological studies of negativistic traitsin nonclinical in 16to 22 percent of school-age children\" (p. 1218). Some parents interpret average or increased level of developmental oppositional behavior as hostilityand a deliberate effort on the part of the child to bein control. If power and control are issues for parents,or if they exercise authority for their own needs, apower struggle can be established between the par-ents and the child that sets the stage for the develop-ment of ODD. Lubit (2011) suggested the followingpattern of family dynamics: There is the combination of a strong-willed child witha reactive and high-energy temperament and parentswho are authoritarian rather than authoritative. The parents become frustrated with the strong-willed child who does not obey and increase theirattempts to enforce authority. The child reacts to the excessive parental controlwith anger and increased self-assertion. Lubit (2011) stated: A downward spiral occurs, with the parent trying to control the child and the child feeling he or she mustrefuse to give in and must defend his or her auton-omy. Both parties become angry and increasinglyrigid in their stances as they try to defend their self-esteem. The child's negative behaviors may be inadvertently rewarded by attention, which, eventhough may be negative, is still desired. Application of the Nursing Process to ODD Background Assessment Data (Symptomatology) ODD is characterized by passive-aggressive behaviors such as stubbornness, procrastination, disobedience,carelessness, negativism, testing of limits, resistance to directions, deliberately ignoring the communica-tion of others, and unwillingness to compromise.Other symptoms that may be evident are runningaway, school avoidance, school underachievement,temper tantrums, fighting, and argumentativeness.728 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch33_703-746 24/07/14 5:34 PM Page 728CHAPTER 33 Children and Adolescents 729 Initially, the oppositional attitude is directed to- ward the parents, but in time, relationships with peers and teachers become affected. These impairments insocial interaction often lead to depression, anxiety,and additional problematic behavior (Lubit, 2011). Usually these children do not see themselves as being oppositional but view the problem as arising fromothers whom they believe are making unreasonable demands on them. These children are often friend-less, perceiving human relationships as negative andunsatisfactory. School performance is usually poor because of their refusal to participate and their resist-ance to external demands. The DSM- 5(APA, 2013) diagnostic criteria for ODD are presented in Box 33-5. Nursing Diagnosis Based on the data collected during the nursing assess-ment, possible nursing diagnoses for the client withODD include the following: Noncompliance with therapy related to negativetemperament, denial of problems, underlyinghostilityDefensive coping related to retarded ego develop-ment, low self-esteem, unsatisfactory parent/childrelationship Low self-esteem related to lack of positive feedback,retarded ego development Impaired social interaction related to negative tem-perament, underlying hostility, manipulation ofothers Outcome Identification Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. The followingcriteria may be used for measurement of outcomes inthe care of the client with ODD. The client: Complies with treatment by participating in thera-pies without negativism. Accepts responsibility for his or her part in theproblem. Takes direction from staff without becoming defensive. Does not manipulate other people. BOX 33-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Oppositional Defiant Disorder A. A pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness lasting at least 6 months as evidenced by at least four symptoms from any of the following categories, and exhibited during interaction withat least one individual that is not a sibling. Angry/Irritable Mood 1. Often loses temper.2. Is often touchy or easily annoyed.3. Is often angry and resentful. Argumentative/Defiant Behavior 4. Often argues with authority figures or, for children and adolescents, with adults. 5. Often actively defies or refuses to comply with requests from authority figures or with rules. 6. Often deliberately annoys others.7. Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior. Vindictiveness 8. Has been spiteful or vindictive at least twice within the past 6 months. Note: The persistence and frequency of these behaviors should be used to distinguish a behavior that is within normal limits from a behavior that is symptomatic. For children younger than 5 years, the behavior should occuron most days for a period of at least 6 months unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). For individuals 5 years orolder, the behavior should occur at least once per weekfor at least 6 months, unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8).While these frequency criteria provide guidance on a min-imal level of frequency to define symptoms, other factorsshould also be considered, such as whether the frequencyand intensity of the behaviors are outside a range that isnormative for the individual's developmental level, gender,and culture. B. The disturbance in behavior is associated with distress in the individual or others in his or her immediate social context (e.g., family, peer group, work colleagues), or itimpacts negatively on social, educational, occupational, orother important areas of functioning. C. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during the course of a psychotic, substance use, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Also, the criteria are not met for disruptive mooddysregulation disorder. Specify current severity: Mild: Symptoms are confined to only one setting (e.g., at home, at school, at work, with peers). Moderate: Some symptoms are present in at least two settings. Severe: Some symptoms are present in three or more settings. Reprinted with permission from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (Copyright 2013).

The following questions can be usedwith the child or adolescent with ODD to gather in-formation for the evaluation: Is the client cooperating with schedule of thera-peutic activities? Is level of participation adequate? Is the client's attitude toward therapy less negative? Is the client accepting responsibility for problembehavior? Is the client verbalizing the unacceptability of hisor her passive-aggressive behavior? Is he or she able to identify which behaviors are unacceptable and substitute more adaptivebehaviors? Is the client able to interact with staff and peers without defending behavior in an angrymanner? Is the client able to verbalize positive statementsabout self? Is increased self-worth evident with fewer manifes-tations of manipulation? Is the client able to make compromises with otherswhen issues of control emerge? Is anger and hostility expressed in an appropriatemanner? Can the client verbalize ways of releasinganger adaptively? Is he or she able to verbalize true feelings insteadof allowing them to emerge through use of passive-aggressive behaviors? Conduct Disorder Clinical Findings, Epidemiology, and Course With conduct disorder, there is a repetitive and per-sistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rightsof others or major age-appropriate societal normsor rules are violated (APA, 2013). Physical aggres-sion is common, and peer relationships are dis-turbed. In general population studies, prevalenceof the disorder has been estimated at 1 to 10 per-cent, with a male predominance ranging from 2:1to 4:1 (Ursano et al., 2008). There is a higher malepredominance among those with the child-onsetsubtype. A number of comorbidities are commonwith conduct disorder, including ADHD, mood dis-orders, learning disorders, and substance use disor-ders. When the disorder begins in childhood, thereis more likely to be a history of ODD and a greaterlikelihood of antisocial personality disorder inadulthood than if the disorder is diagnosed in ado-lescence. Black and Andreasen (2011) report thatan estimated 40 percent of boys and 25 percent ofgirls with conduct disorder will develop adult anti-social personality disorder.Predisposing Factors Biological Influences Genetics Family, twin, and adoptive studies have re-vealed a significantly higher number of individualswith conduct disorder among those who have familymembers with the disorder (Black & Andreasen,2011). Although genetic factors appear to be involvedin the etiology of conduct disorder, little is yet known about the actual mechanisms involved in genetictransmission. One study found that regions on chro-mosomes 19 and 2 may contain genes conferring riskto conduct disorder (Dick et al., 2004). In this study , the same region on chromosome 2 was also linked toalcohol dependence. These researchers reported thatchildhood conduct disorder is known to be associatedwith the susceptibility to future alcohol problems.They concluded that these findings suggest that someof the genes contributing to alcohol dependence inadulthood may also contribute to conduct disorderin childhood. Temperament The term temperament refers to personality traits that become evident very early in life and may be present at birth. Evidence suggests a genetic compo- nent in temperament and an association between tem-perament and behavioral problems later in life. Studieshave shown that, without appropriate intervention, dif-ficult temperament at age 3 has significant links to con-duct disorder and movement into care or institutionallife at age 17 (Bagley & Mallick, 2000). Biochemical Factors Researchers have investigated var- ious chemicals as biological markers. Alterations inthe neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotoninhave been suggested by some studies (Comings et al.,2000; Searight, Rottnek, & Abby, 2001). Some inves- tigators have examined the possibility of testosteroneassociation with violence. One study correlates higherlevels of testosterone in pubertal boys with social dom-inance and association with deviant peers (Rowe,Maughan, W orthman, Costello, & Angold, 2004). Psychosocial Influences Peer Relationships Social groups have a significant im-pact on a child's development. Peers play an essential role in the socialization of interpersonal competence,732 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations CORE CONCEPT Temperament Personality characteristics that define an individual's mood and behavioral tendencies. The sum of physical,emotional, and intellectual components that affect ordetermine a person's actions and reactions. 4092_Ch33_703-746 24/07/14 5:34 PM Page 732and skills acquired in this manner affect the child's long-term adjustment. Studies have shown that poorpeer relations during childhood were consistently im-plicated in the etiology of later deviance (Ladd,1999). Aggression was found to be the principal causeof peer rejection, thus contributing to a cycle of mal-adaptive behavior. Family Influences The following factors related to family dynamics havebeen implicated as contributors in the predispositionto conduct disorder (Foley et al., 2004; Sadock &Sadock, 2007; Ursano et al., 2008): Parental rejection Inconsistent management with harsh discipline Early institutional living Frequent shifting of parental figures Large family size Absent father Parents with antisocial personality disorder and/oralcohol dependence Marital conflict and divorce Inadequate communication patterns Parental permissiveness Application of the Nursing Process to Conduct Disorder Background Assessment Data (Symptomatology) The classic characteristic of conduct disorder is the use of physical aggression in the violation of the rightsof others. The behavior pattern manifests itself in virtually all areas of the child's life (home, school,with peers, and in the community). Stealing, lying,and truancy are common problems. The child lacksfeelings of guilt or remorse. The use of tobacco, liquor, or nonprescribed drugs, as well as the participation in sexual activities, occursearlier than at the expected age for the peer group.Projection is a common defense mechanism. Low self-esteem is manifested by a \"tough guy\" image. Characteristics include poor frustration tolerance, irritability, and frequent temper outbursts. Symptomsof anxiety and depression are not uncommon. Level of academic achievement may be low in re- lation to age and IQ. Manifestations associated withADHD (e.g., attention difficulties, impulsiveness, andhyperactivity) are common in children with conductdisorder. The DSM -5diagnostic criteria for conduct disorder are presented in Box 33-6. Nursing Diagnosis Based on the data collected during the nursing assess-ment, possible nursing diagnoses for the client withconduct disorder include the following: Risk for other-directed violence related to character-istics of temperament, peer rejection, negative par - ental role models, dysfunctional family dynamics Impaired social interaction related to negativeparental role models, impaired peer relations lead-ing to inappropriate social behaviorsCHAPTER 33 Children and Adolescents 733 BOX 33-6 Diagnostic Criteria for Conduct Disorder A. A repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate so- cietal norms or rules are violated, as manifested by the presence of at least three of the following 15 criteriain the past 12 months from any of the categoriesbelow, with at least one criterion present in the past 6 months: Aggression to People and Animals 1. Often bullies, threatens, or intimidates others.2. Often initiates physical fights.3. Has used a weapon that can cause serious physical harm to others (e.g., a bat, brick, broken bottle, knife, gun). 4. Has been physically cruel to people.5. Has been physically cruel to animals.6.

Has deliberately engaged in fire setting with the intention of causing serious damage. 9. Has deliberately destroyed others' property (other than by fire setting). Deceitfulness or Theft 10. Has broken into someone else's house, building, or car. 11. Often lies to obtain goods or favors or to avoid obligations (i.e., \"cons\" others). 12. Has stolen items of nontrivial value without confronting a victim (e.g., shoplifting, but withoutbreaking and entering; forgery). Serious Violations of Rules 13.

Outcome Identification Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. The follow-ing criteria may be used for measurement of out-comes in the care of the client with conductdisorder. The client: Has not harmed self or others. Interacts with others in a socially appropriate manner. Accepts direction without becoming defensive. Demonstrates evidence of increased self-esteem bydiscontinuing exploitative and demanding behav-iors toward others. Planning/Implementation Table 33-9 provides a plan of care for the child withconduct disorder using nursing diagnoses commonto the disorder, outcome criteria, and appropriatenursing interventions and rationales. Evaluation Following the planning and implementation of care,evaluation is made of the behavioral changes in thechild with conduct disorder. This is accomplished bydetermining if the goals of therapy have beenachieved. Reassessment, the next step in the nursingprocess, may be initiated by gathering informationusing the following questions: Have the nursing actions directed toward manag-ing the client's aggressive behavior been effective?Have interventions prevented harm to others orothers' property? Is the client able to express anger in an appropriatemanner? Has the client developed more adaptive coping strate-gies to deal with anger and feelings of aggression? Does the client demonstrate the ability to trust oth-ers? Is he or she able to interact with staff and peersin an appropriate manner? Is the client able to accept responsibility for his orher own behavior? Is there less blaming of others? Is the client able to accept feedback from otherswithout becoming defensive? Is the client able to verbalize positive statementsabout self? Is the client able to interact with others without en-gaging in manipulation? Anxiety Disorders Separation Anxiety Disorder Clinical Findings, Epidemiology, and Course Separation anxiety disorder is characterized by exces-sive fear or anxiety concerning separation from thoseto whom the individual is attached (APA, 2013). Theanxiety is beyond that which would be expected for theindividual's developmental level and interferes with social, academic, occupational, or other areas of func-tioning. Onset may occur any time before age 18 yearsbut is most commonly diagnosed around age 5 or 6,when the child goes to school. Prevalence estimates forthe disorder average about 4 percent in children andyoung adults, and it is more common in girls than in boys. Most children grow out of it, but in some instances the symptoms can persist into adulthood734 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations BOX 33-6 Diagnostic Criteria for Conduct Disorder\u2014 cont'd 14.

Separation anxiety disorder can be a precursor to adult panic disorder(Black & Andreasen, 2011). Predisposing Factors Biological Influences Genetics Studies have been conducted in which the children of adult clients diagnosed as havingseparation anxiety disorder were studied. A secondmethod, studying parents and other relatives of chil-dren diagnosed as having separation anxiety disor- der , has also been used. The results have shown that a greater number of children with relatives whomanifest anxiety problems develop anxiety disor-ders themselves than do children with no such fam-ily patterns. The results are significant enough to4092_Ch33_703-746 24/07/14 5:34 PM Page 736CHAPTER 33 Children and Adolescents 737 speculate that there is a hereditary influence in the development of separation anxiety disorder, but themode of genetic transmission has not been deter-mined. Sadock and Sadock (2007) state: Current consensus on the genetics of anxiety disor- ders suggests that what is inherited is a general pre-disposition toward anxiety, with resulting heightenedlevels of arousability, emotional reactivity, and in-creased negative affect, all of which increase the riskfor the development of separation anxiety disorder[and other anxiety disorders]. (p. 1278) Temperament It is well established that children differ from birth, or shortly thereafter, on a number of tem- peramental characteristics. Shamir -Essakow, Ungerer, construct termed \"behavioral inhibi- tion to the unfamiliar\" is characterized by the predis-position to be irritable as an infant, unusually shy andfearful as a toddler, and quiet, cautious, and withdrawnin the preschool and early school age years, withmarked behavioral restraint and physiological arousalin unfamiliar situations. Integrated models proposethat environmental factors, such as parent-child attach-ment, may combine with temperament to increase therisk for the development of childhood anxiety. (p. 131) Individual differences in temperaments may be related to the acquisition of fear and anxiety disorders in childhood. This may be referred to as anxiety prone- ness or vulnerability and may denote an inherited \"disposition\" toward developing anxiety disorders. Environmental Influences Stressful Life Events Studies have shown a relationshipbetween life events and the development of anxiety disorders (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). It is thought thatper haps children who already are vulnerable or predis- posed to developing anxiety disorders may be affectedsignificantly by stressful life events. More research isneeded before firm conclusions can be drawn. Family Influences Various theories expound on the idea that anxiety dis-orders in children are related to an overattachmentto the mother. Attachment theorists attribute themajor determinants of anxiety disorders to transac-tions relating to separation issues between mother (or mothering figure) and child (Shamir-Essakow et al., 2005). Some parents may instill anxiety in their children by overprotecting them from expectable dangers orby exaggerating the dangers of the present and thefuture (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Some parents mayalso transfer their fears and anxieties to their childrenthrough role modeling. For example, a parent whobecomes fearful in the presence of a small, harmlessdog and retreats with dread and apprehensionteaches the young child by example that this is an appropriate response. Application of the Nursing Process to Separation Anxiety Disorder Background Assessment Data (Symptomatology) Age at onset of this disorder may be as early as pre- school age; it rarely begins as late as adolescence. Inmost cases, the child has difficulty separating from themother. Occasionally the separation reluctance is directed toward the father, siblings, or other signifi-cant individual to whom the child is attached. Anti - cipation of separation may result in tantrums, crying,screaming, complaints of physical problems, andclinging behaviors. Reluctance or refusal to attend school is especially common in adolescence. Younger children may\"shadow\" or follow around the person from whomthey are afraid to be separated. During middle child-hood or adolescence they may refuse to sleep awayfrom home (e.g., at a friend's house or at camp). In-terpersonal peer relationships are usually not aproblem with these children. They are generally wellliked by their peers and are reasonably sociallyskilled. Worrying is common and relates to the possibility of harm coming to self or to the attachment figure.Younger children may even have nightmares to thiseffect. Specific phobias are not uncommon (e.g., fear of the dark, ghosts, animals). Depressed mood isfrequently present and often precedes the onset of the anxiety symptoms, which commonly occurfollowing a major stressor. The DSM- 5diagnostic cri- teria for separation anxiety disorder are presentedin Box 33-7. Nursing Diagnosis Based on the data collected during the nursing assess-ment, possible nursing diagnoses for the client withseparation anxiety disorder include the following: Anxiety (severe) related to family history, tempera-ment, overattachment to parent, negative rolemodeling Ineffective coping related to unresolved separationconflicts and inadequate coping skills evidenced bynumerous somatic complaints Impaired social interaction related to reluctance tobe away from attachment figure Outcome Identification Outcome criteria include short- and long-term goals.Timelines are individually determined. The follow-ing criteria may be used for measurement of out-comes in the care of the client with separationanxiety disorder.4092_Ch33_703-746 24/07/14 5:34 PM Page 737The client: Is able to maintain anxiety at manageable level. Demonstrates adaptive coping strategies for deal- ing with anxiety when separation from attachmentfigure is anticipated. Interacts appropriately with others and spendstime away from attachment figure to do so. Planning/Implementation Table 33-10 provides a plan of care for the child oradolescent with separation anxiety, using nursingdiagnoses common to this disorder, outcome cri-teria, and appropriate nursing interventions andrationales. Evaluation Evaluation of the child or adolescent with separationanxiety disorder requires reassessment of the behav-iors for which the family sought treatment. Both theclient and the family members will have to changetheir behavior. The following types of questions mayprovide assistance in gathering data required for eval-uating whether the nursing interventions have beeneffective in achieving the goals of therapy: Is the client able to maintain anxiety at a manage-able level (i.e., without temper tantrums, scream-ing, or clinging)? Have complaints of physical symptoms diminished?Has the client demonstrated the ability to cope inmore adaptive ways in the face of escalating anxiety? Have the parents identified their role in the sepa-ration conflict? Are they able to discuss more adap-tive coping strategies? Does the client verbalize an intention to return toschool? Have nightmares and fears of the dark subsided? Is the client able to interact with others away fromthe attachment figure? Has the precipitating stressor been identified?Have strategies for coping more adaptively to sim-ilar stressors in the future been established? Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) The Institute of Medicine (IOM), in its 2003 report,Health Professions Education: A Bridge to Quality, chal- lenged faculties of medicine, nursing, and otherhealth professions to ensure that their graduates haveachieved a core set of competencies in order to meetthe needs of the 21st-century health-care system.These competencies include providing patient-centered care, working in interdisciplinary teams, employing evidence-based practice, applying quality improvement, ensuringsafety, andutilizing informatics.

The use of this type of738 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations BOX 33-7 Diagnostic Criteria for Separation Anxiety Disorder A. Developmentally inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from those to whom the individual is attached, as evidenced by at least three ofthe following:1. Recurrent excessive distress when anticipating or experiencing separation from home or major attachment figures. 2. Persistent and excessive worry about losing major attachment figures or about possible harm to them,such as illness, injury, disasters, or death. 3. Persistent and excessive worry about experiencing an untoward event (e.g., getting lost, being kidnapped,having an accident, becoming ill) that causes separationfrom a major attachment figure. 4. Persistent reluctance or refusal to go out, away from home, to school, to work, or elsewhere because of fearof separation. 5. Persistent and excessive fear of or reluctance about being alone or without major attachment figures athome or in other settings. 6. Persistent reluctance or refusal to sleep away from home or to go to sleep without being near a major attachment figure.7. Repeated nightmares involving the theme of separation.8. Repeated complaints of physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, stomachaches, nausea, vomiting) whenseparation from major attachment figures occurs or isanticipated. B. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, lasting at least 4 weeks in children and adolescents and typically 6 months or more in adults. C. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder, such as refusing to leave home becauseof excessive resistance to change in autism spectrum disorder; delusions or hallucinations concerning separa-tion in psychotic disorders; refusal to go outside withouta trusted companion in agoraphobia; worries about ill health or other harm befalling significant others in generalized anxiety disorder; or concerns about havingan illness in illness anxiety disorder. .

General Therapeutic Approaches Behavior Therapy Behavior therapy is based on the concepts of classicalconditioning and operant conditioning. Behaviortherapy is a common and effective treatment with dis-ruptive behavior disorders such as ADHD, ODD, andconduct disorder. With this approach, rewards aregiven for appropriate behaviors and withheld whenbehaviors are disruptive or otherwise inappropriate.The principle behind behavior therapy is that positivereinforcements encourage repetition of desirable behaviors and aversive reinforcements (punishments)discourage repetition of undesirable behaviors. Be-havior modification techniques\u2014the system of re-wards and consequences\u2014can be taught to parentsto be used in the home environment. Consistency isan essential component. In the treatment setting, individualized behavior modification programs are designed for each client.A case study example, based on a token economy, ispresented in Chapter 18. Family Therapy Children cannot be separated from their family. Ther-apy for children and adolescents must involve the entire family if problems are to be resolved. Parentsshould be involved in designing and implementingthe treatment plan for the child and should be involved in all aspects of the treatment process. The genogram can be used to identify problem areas between family members (see Chapter 11). Itprovides an overall picture of the life of the familyover several generations, including roles that variousfamily members play and emotional distance be-tween specific individuals. Areas for change can beeasily identified. The impact of family dynamics on disruptive behavior disorders has been identified. The impactof disruptive behavior on family dynamics cannot beignored. Family coping can become severely com-promised by the chronic stress of dealing with achild with a behavior disorder. It is therefore imper-ative that the treatment plan for the identified clientbe instituted within the context of family-centeredcare. Group Therapy Group therapy provides children and adolescentswith the opportunity to interact within an associationof their peers. This can be both gratifying and over-whelming, depending on the child. Group therapy provides a number of benefits. Ap- propriate social behavior often is learned from thepositive and negative feedback of peers. Opportunityis provided to learn to tolerate and accept differencesin others, to learn that it is acceptable to disagree, tolearn to offer and receive support from others, andto practice these new skills in a safe environment. Itis a way to learn from the experiences of others. Group therapy with children and adolescents can take several forms. Music therapy groups allow clientsto express feelings through music, often when theyare unable to express themselves in any other way. Artand activity/craft therapy groups allow individual ex-pression through artistic means. Group play therapy is the treatment of choice for many children between the ages of 3 and 9 years.Landreth and Bratton (2007) state: Play therapy is to children what counseling or psy- chotherapy is to adults. Play provides children with ameans of expressing their inner world. The use oftoys enables children to transfer anxieties, fears, fan-tasies, and guilt to objects rather than people. In theprocess, children are safe from their own feelings andreactions because play enables children to distancethemselves from traumatic events and experiences.For children, play therapy changes what may be un-manageable in reality into manageable situationsthrough symbolic representation. This provides chil-dren with opportunities for learning to cope. Psychoeducational groups are very beneficial for adolescents. The only drawback to this type of group is that it works best when the group is closed-ended; thatis, once the group has been formed, no one is allowedto join until the group has reached its preestablishedclosure. Members are allowed to propose topics for dis-cussion. The leader serves as teacher much of the timeand facilitates discussion of the proposed topic. Mem-bers may from time to time be presenters and serve asdiscussion leaders. Sometimes, psychoeducation groupsevolve into traditional therapy discussion groups. Psychopharmacology Several of the disorders presented in this chapter aretreated with medications. The appropriate pharmacol-ogy was presented following the section in which thedisorder was discussed. Medication should never be thesole method of treatment. It is undeniable that med-ication can and does improve quality of life for familiesof children and adolescents with these disorders. How-ever, research has indicated that medication alone isnot as effective as a combination of medication andpsychosocial therapy. It is important for families to un-derstand that there is no way to \"give him a pill andCHAPTER 33 Children and Adolescents 7414092_Ch33_703-746 24/07/14 5:35 PM Page 741make him well.\" The importance of the psychosocial therapies cannot be overstressed. Some clinicians willnot prescribe medications for a client unless he or shealso participates in concomitant psychotherapy ses-sions. The beneficial effects of the medications pro-mote improved coping ability, which in turn enhancesthe intent of the psychosocial therapy. Summary and Key Points Intellectual disability is defined by deficits in generalintellectual functioning and adaptive functioning. Four levels of intellectual disability\u2014mild, mod-erate, severe, and profound\u2014are associated withvarious behavioral manifestations and abilities. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterizedby a withdrawal of the child into the self and into afantasy world of his or her own creation. It is generally accepted that ASD is caused by abnormalities in brain structures or functions. Genetic factors are also thought to play a signifi-cant role in ASD. Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disor-der (ADHD) may exhibit symptoms of inattentionor hyperactivity and impulsiveness or a combina-tion of the two. Genetics plays a role in the etiology of ADHD. Neu-rotransmitters that have been implicated includedopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Mater-nal smoking during pregnancy has been behavior in offspring. CNS stimulants, alpha agonists, atomoxetine, andbupropion are commonly used to treat ADHD.The essential feature of Tourette's disorder is the pres-ence of multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics. Common medications used with Tourette's disor-der by apattern of negativistic, defiant, disobedient, andhostile behavior toward authority figures that oc-curs more frequently than is usually observed in in-dividuals of comparable age and developmentallevel. With conduct disorder, there is a repetitive andpersistent pattern of behavior in which the basicrights of others or major age-appropriate societalnorms or rules are violated. The essential feature of separation anxiety disor-der is excessive anxiety concerning separationfrom the home or from those to whom the personis attached. Children with separation anxiety disorder mayhave temperamental characteristics present at birththat predispose them to the disorder. General therapeutic approaches for child and ado-lescent psychiatric disorders include behavior ther-apy, family therapy, group therapies (includingmusic, art, crafts, play, and psychoeducation), andpsychopharmacology.742 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations Additional info available at www.davisplus.com Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE Frame, K., Kelly, L., & Bayley, E. (2003). Increasing per- ceptions of self-worth , 35(3), 225-229. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: The theoretical framework for this study was based on the Roy adaptation model. T he sample in this study consisted of 65 preadolescents diag- nosed with ADD or ADH D in an upper-middle class com- munity in the United States. Participants were randomlyassigned to either the control group or the experimentalgroup, and all completed the Harter's Self-Perception Profilefor Children instrument at the beginning of the study and 4 weeks later. This tool was designed to measure percep-tions of scholastic competence, social acceptance, athleticcompetence, physical appearance, behavioral conduct, and global self-worth. Children in the experimental groupparticipated in a school-nurse facilitated support group thatmet twice weekly for 4 weeks. In the group, the participantswere assisted to learn strategies for effective interactionswith their peers, teachers, and families. Interventions servedto promote adaptive self-evaluations and to address the unfavorable self-perceptions of many children with ADHD.RESULTS OF THE STUDY: On post-testing, participants in the suppor t g roup scored significantly higher than controls on each of the six subscales, with significant increases on fourof the subscales, including perceived social acceptance, per-ceived athletic competence, perceived physical appearance,and perceived global self-worth. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: This study has implications for nurses who work with children, and par tic- ularly those who work with children diagnosed with ADH D. Because preadolescence is a time when children compare themselves, either positively or negatively, with their peers,group interaction is an especially significant intervention.The authors stated, \"The support group, with children help-ing children, enabled participants to engage in creativeproblem-solving and to develop solutions to their difficul-ties.\" This intervention was shown to promote positive per-ceptions and behaviors among children with ADD andADHD. It is especially appropriate for the role of schoolnurse, but it is also consistent with the role of any nursewho interacts directly with children or adolescents whohave similar problems. IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE Hall, L.A., Rayens, M.K., & Peden, A.R. (2008). Maternal factors associated with child behavior. Journal of Nursing Scholarship, 40(2), 124-130. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to identify maternal predictors of children's internalizing be- haviors (e.g., anxiety , depression, complaints) and externalizing behaviors (e.g., impulsivity , disruptiveness, and aggression). The sample included 205 low-income, single mothers with children between 2 and 6 years of age. Other criteria for inclusion in the studysample were not being in psychiatric care or counseling,not taking antidepressant medication, not being suicidal,not being pregnant, and having no children younger than1 year of age. Maternal variables were measured as follows:The Beck Depression Inventory was used to measure depressive symptoms; negative thinking was measuredusing the Crandell Cognitions Inventory; self-worth and self-acceptance were measured on the Rosenberg Self-esteemScale; and chronic stress was measured on the EverydayStressors Index, which assesses common problems faceddaily by mothers with young children. Surveys were con-ducted using in-home interviews with the mothers. RESULTS OF THE STUDY: Maternal stress exerted the largest total effects on children's internalizing and externalizing be- haviors. Depressive symptoms had the second largest totaleffect, followed by negative thinking. Mothers' self-esteemdisplayed the weakest total effect on both child outcomes.Other studies have shown that maternal depression is associated with their children's poor school per formance, slow cognitive and motor development, and elevated corti-sol levels. Very young children with behavior problems areat risk for continuation of these problems into school ageand adolescence. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The authors suggest that the types of stressors faced by low-income women need to be identified and attempts made at alleviation by inter-vention or referral to social services for suppor t. T reatment of the mother's depression with antidepressant medicationand cognitive-behavioral strategies to reduce negative think-ing may also provide positive benefits for their children. Theauthors state: The findings of this study indicate that a focus ondecreasing mothers' negative thinking may providea way to reduce their depressive symptoms and re-sult in fewer behavior problems among their youngchildren. Nurses working in primary care and com-munity-based setting are in key positions to addressthis problem and improve the mental health oflow-income mothers and positively affect the be-havior of their children.4092_Ch33_703-746 24/07/14 5:35 PM Page 744References American Psychiatric Association (APA).

He has been un-manageable at school and at home, and has had several suspensionsfrom school for continuous disruption of his class. He refuses to sit inhis chair or do his work. He yells out in class, interrupts the teacherand the other students, and lately has become physically aggressivewhen he cannot have his way. Most recently, he was suspended afterhitting his teacher when she asked him to return to his seat. Jimmy's mother describes him as a restless and demanding baby, who grew into a restless and demanding toddler. He hasnever gotten along well with his peers. Even as a small child, hewould take his friends' toys away from them or bite them if theytried to hold their own with him. His 5-year-old sister is afraid ofhim and refuses to be alone with him. During the nurse's intake assessment, Jimmy paced the room or rocked in his chair. He talked incessantly on a superficial leveland jumped from topic to topic. He told the nurse that he did notknow why he was there. He acknowledged that he had some prob-lems at school but said that was only because the other kids pickedon him and the teacher did not like him. He said he got into troubleat home sometimes but that was because his parents liked his littlesister better than they liked him. The physician has ordered methylphenidate 5 mg twice a day for Jimmy. His response to this order is, \"I'm not going to take drugs.I'm not sick!\" Answer the following questions related to Jimmy: 1.What are the pertinent assessment data to be noted by thenurse? 2.What is the primary nursing diagnosis for Jimmy? 3.Aside from client safety, to what problems would the nursewant to direct intervention with Jimmy?4092_Ch33_703-746 24/07/14 5:35 PM Page 745INTERNET REFERENCES \u0081Additional information about may be located at the following websites:\u0081http://www.chadd.org \u0081http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/index.shtml \u0081Additional information about ASD may be located at thefollowing websites:\u0081http://www.autism-society.org \u0081http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/autism-spectrum-disorders-asd/index.shtml \u0081Additional information about Tourette's disorder may be located at the following websites:\u0081http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/tourette/detail_tourette.htm \u0081http://www.tsa-usa.org \u0081Additional information about medications to treat ADHDand T ourette's disorder may be located at the following websites:\u0081http://www .drugs.com \u0081http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginformation.html 746 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations Shriber, L.

HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT Please read the chapter and answer the following questions: 1.Which theory of aging postulates that life span and longevity changes are predetermined? 2.How is the ability to learn affected by aging?3.What is the most common cause of psychopatholog y in the elderly? 4.W hat are some factors that are thought to contribute to elder abuse? 747What is it like to grow old? It is not likely that many people in the American culture would state that it issomething they want to do. Most would agree, how-ever, that it is \"better than the alternative.\" Roberts (1991) tells the following often-told tale of Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. Inthe year before he retired at age 91 as the oldest jus-tice ever to sit on the Supreme Court of the UnitedStates, Holmes and his close friend Justice Louis Brandeis, then a mere 74 years old, were out for one oftheir frequent walks on Washington's Capitol Hill. Onthis particular day, the justices spotted a very attractive4092_Ch34_747-776 23/07/14 12:46 PM Page 747young woman approaching them. As she passed, Holmes paused, sighed, and said to Brandeis, \"Oh, tobe 70 again!\" Obviously, being old is relative to the individual experiencing it. Growing old has not been popular among the youth- oriented American culture. However, with 66 million\"baby-boomers\" reaching their 65th birthdays by theyear 2030, greater emphasis is being placed on theneeds of an aging population. The disciplines of geron- tology (the study of the aging process), geriatrics (the branch of clinical medicine specializing in problems ofthe elderly), and geropsychiatry (the branch of clinical medicine specializing in psychopathology of the elderlypopulation) are expanding rapidly in response to thispredictable demand. Growing old in a society that has been obsessed with youth may have a critical impact on the mentalhealth of many people. This situation has serious im-plications for psychiatric nursing. What is it like to grow old? More and more people will be able to answer this question as the 21st centuryprogresses. Perhaps they will also be asking the questionthat Roberts (1991) asks: \"How did I get here so fast?\" This chapter focuses on physical and psychological changes associated with the aging process, as well asspecial concerns of the elderly population, such as re-tirement, long-term care, elder abuse, and high suiciderates. The nursing process is presented as the vehiclefor delivery of nursing care to elderly individuals. How Old Is Old? The concept of \"old\" has changed drastically over theyears. Our prehistoric ancestors probably had a lifespan of 40 years, with the average individual livingaround 18 years. As civilization developed, mortalityrates remained high as a result of periodic famine andfrequent malnutrition. An improvement in the stan-dard of living was not truly evident until about themiddle of the 17th century. Since that time, assuredfood supply, changes in food production, better hous-ing conditions, and more progressive medical andsanitation facilities have contributed to populationgrowth, declining mortality rates, and substantial in-creases in longevity. In 1900, the average life expectancy in the United States was 47 years, and only 4 percent of the popula-tion was age 65 or over. By 2011, the average life ex-pectancy at birth was 78.7 years (76.3 years for menand 81.1 years for women) (National Center forHealth Statistics [NCHS], 2012a). The U.S. Census Bureau has created a system for classification of older Americans: Older: 55 through 64 years Elderly: 65 through 74 yearsAged: 75 through 84 years Very old: 85 years and older Some gerontologists have elected to use a simpler classification system: Young old: 60 through 74 years Middle old: 75 through 84 years Old old: 85 years and older So how old is old ? Obviously the term cannot be defined by a number. Myths and stereotypes ofaging have long obscured our understanding of theaged and the process of aging. Ideas that all elderlyindividuals are sick, depressed, obsessed with death,senile, and incapable of change affect the way eld-erly people are treated. They even shape the patternof aging of the people who believe them. They canbecome self-fulfilling prophecies\u2014people start tobelieve they should behave in certain ways and,therefore, act according to those beliefs. General-ized assumptions can be demeaning and interferewith the quality of life for older individuals. Just as there are many differences in individual adaptation at earlier stages of development, so it is inthe elderly population. Erikson (1963) has suggestedthat the mentally healthy older person possesses asense of ego integrity and self-acceptance that willhelp in adapting to the ambiguities of the future witha sense of security and optimism. Murray, Zentner, and Yakimo (2009) stated: [Having accomplished the earlier developmental tasks], the person accepts life as his or her own andas the only life for the self. He or she would wish fornone other and would defend the meaning and thedignity of the lifestyle. The person has further refinedthe characteristics of maturity described for the mid-dle-aged adult, achieving both wisdom and an en-riched perspective about life and people. (p. 662) Everyone, particularly health-care workers, should see aging people as individuals, each with specific needs and abilities, rather than as a stereotypicalgroup. Some individuals may seem \"old\" at 40,whereas others may not seem \"old\" at 70. Variablessuch as attitude, mental health, physical health, anddegree of independence strongly influence how anindividual perceives himself or herself. Surely, in thefinal analysis, whether one is considered \"old\" mustbe self-determined. Epidemiological Statistics The Population In 1980, Americans 65 years of age or older num-bered 25.5 million. By 2012, these numbers had in-creased to 43.1 million, representing 13.7 percent of748 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch34_747-776 23/07/14 12:46 PM Page 748the population (Administration on Aging [AoA], 2014). This trend is expected to continue, with a pro-jection for 2040 at about 79.7 million, or 21 percentof the population. Marital Status In 2013, of individuals age 65 and older, 71 percentof men and 45 percent of women were married(AoA, 2014). Thirty-six percent of all women in thisage group were widowed. There were over threetimes as many widows as widowers, because womenlive longer than men and tend to marry men olderthan themselves. Living Arrangements The majority of individuals age 65 or older live alone,with a spouse, or with relatives (AoA, 2014). At anyone time, fewer than 5 percent of people in this agegroup live in institutions. This percentage increasesdramatically with age, ranging from 1 percent forpersons 65 to 74 years, to 3 percent for persons 75 to84 years, and 10 percent for persons 85 and older.See Figure 34-1 for a distribution of living arrange-ments for noninstitutionalized persons age 65 andolder. Economic Status More than 3.9 million persons age 65 or older werebelow the poverty level in 2012 (AoA, 2014). Olderwomen had a higher poverty rate than older men,and older Hispanic women living alone had the high-est poverty rate. Poor people who have worked alltheir lives can expect to become poorer in old age,and others will become poor only after becoming old.However, there are a substantial number of affluentand middle-income older persons who enjoy a highquality of life. Of individuals in this age group, 81 percent owned their own homes in 2011 (AoA, 2014). However, thehousing of this population of Americans is usuallyolder and less adequate than that of the younger population; therefore, a higher percentage of incomemust be spent on maintenance and repairs. Employment With the passage of the Age Discrimination in Em-ployment Act in 1967, forced retirement has been virtually eliminated in the workplace. Evidence sug-gests that involvement in purposeful activity is vital tosuccessful adaptation and perhaps even to survival. In2013, 8.1 million Americans age 65 and older were inthe labor force (working or actively seeking work)(AoA, 2014).Health Status The number of days in which usual activities are restricted because of illness or injury increases withage. The National Council on Aging (NCOA) (2012)reports that approximately 92 percent of older adultshave at least one chronic condition, and 77 percenthave at least two. The most commonly occurring con-ditions among the elderly population are hyperten-sion, arthritis, heart disease, cancer, and diabetes(AoA, 2014). Emotional and mental illnesses increase over the life cycle. Depression is particularly prevalent, and suicideis a serious problem among elderly Americans. Neu-rocognitive disorders increase dramatically in old age.CHAPTER 34 The Aging Individual 749 Men spouse FIGURE 34-1 Living arrangements of noninstitutionalized persons age 65 and older (NCHS, 2 012c).4092_Ch34_747-776 23/07/14 12:46 PM Page 749Theories of Aging* A number of theories related to the aging process have been described. These theories are grouped intotwo broad categories: biological and psychosocial. Biological Theories Biological theories attempt to explain the physicalprocess of aging, including molecular and cellularchanges in the major organ systems and the body'sability to function adequately and resist disease. Theyalso attempt to explain why people age differentlyand what factors affect longevity and the body's abilityto resist disease. Genetic Theory According to genetic theory, aging is an involuntarilyinherited process that operates over time to alter cel-lular or tissue structures. This theory suggests that lifespan and longevity changes are predetermined. Stanley, Blair, and Beare (2005) state: [Genetic] theories posit that the replication process at the cellular level becomes deranged by inappropriateinformation provided from the cell nucleus. The DNAmolecule becomes cross-linked with another substancethat alters the genetic information. This cross-linkingresults in errors at the cellular level that eventuallycause the body's organs and systems to fail. (p. 12) The development of free radicals, collagen, and lipofuscin in the aging body, and of an increased fre- quency in the occurrence of cancer and autoimmunedisorders, provide some evidence for this theory andthe proposition that error or mutation occurs at themolecular and cellular level. Wear-and-Tear Theory Proponents of this theory believe that the body wearsout on a scheduled basis. Free radicals, which are thewaste products of metabolism, accumulate and causedamage to important biological structures. Free rad-icals are molecules with unpaired electrons that existnormally in the body; they also are produced by ion-izing radiation, ozone, and chemical toxins. Accord-ing to this theory, these free radicals cause DNAdamage, cross-linkage of collagen, and the accumula-tion of age pigments. Environmental Theory According to this theory, factors in the environment(e.g., industrial carcinogens, sunlight, trauma, and infection) bring about changes in the aging process.Although these factors are known to accelerate aging,the impact of the environment is a secondary ratherthan a primary factor in aging. Science is only begin-ning to uncover the many environmental factors thataffect aging. Immunity Theory The immunity theory describes an age-related declinein the immune system. As people age, their ability todefend against foreign organisms decreases, resultingin susceptibility to diseases such as cancer and infec-tion. Along with the diminished immune function, arise in the body's autoimmune response occurs, lead-ing to the development of autoimmune diseases suchas rheumatoid arthritis and allergies to food and en-vironmental agents. Neuroendocrine Theory This theory proposes that aging occurs because of aslowing of the secretion of certain hormones that havean impact on reactions regulated by the nervous sys-tem. This is most clearly demonstrated in the pituitarygland, thyroid, adrenals, and the glands of reproduc-tion. Although research has given some credence to apredictable biological clock that controls fertility,there is much more to be learned from the study ofthe neuroendocrine system in relation to a systemicaging process that is controlled by a \"clock.\" Psychosocial Theories Psychosocial theories focus on social and psychologi-cal changes that accompany advancing age, as op-posed to the biological implications of anatomicdeterioration. Several theories have attempted to de-scribe how attitudes and behavior in the early phasesof life affect people's reactions during the late phase.This work is called the process of \"successful aging.\" Personality Theory Personality theories address aspects of psychologicalgrowth without delineating specific tasks or expectationsof older adults. Some evidence suggests that personalitycharacteristics in old age are highly correlated with earlylife characteristics. Murray and associates (2009) state: No specific personality changes occur as a result of aging. The older person becomes more of what he orshe was. The older person continues to develop emo-tionally and in personality and adds on characteristicsinstead of making drastic changes. (p. 663) In extreme old age, however, people show greater similarity in certain characteristics, probably because of similar declines in biological functioning and soci-etal opportunities. In a classic study by Reichard, Livson, and Peterson (1962), the personalities of older men were classified750 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations *This section was adapted from M. Stanley, K.A. Blair, & P.G. Beare (2005). Gerontological nursing: Promoting success- ful aging with older adults (3rd ed.). Philadelphia, PA: F.A. Davis, with permission. 4092_Ch34_747-776 23/07/14 12:46 PM Page 750into the following five major categories according to their patterns of adjustment to aging. 1.Mature men are considered well-balanced personswho maintain close personal relationships. Theyaccept both the strengths and weaknesses of theirage, finding little to regret about retirement andapproaching most problems in a relaxed or con-vivial manner without continually having to assessblame. 2.\"Rocking chair\" personalities are found in passive- dependent individuals who are content to lean onothers for support, to disengage, and to let mostof life's activities pass them by . 3.Armored men have well-integrated defense mecha- nisms, which serve as adequate protection. Rigid and stable, they present a strong silent front and often rely on activity as an expression of their con-tinuing independence. 4.Angr y men are bitter about life, themselves, and other people. Aggressiveness is common, as is sus-picion of others, especially of minorities orwomen. With little tolerance for ambiguity or frus-tration, they have always shown some instability inwork and their personal lives, and now feel ex-tremely threatened by old age. 5.Self-haters are similar to angry men, except that most of their animosity is turned inward on them-selves. Seeing themselves as dismal failures, beingold only depresses them all the more. The investigators identified the mature, \"rocking chair ,\" and armored categories as characteristic of healthy, adjusted individuals and the angry and self-hater categories as less successful at aging. In all cases,the evidence suggested that the personalities of thesubjects, although distinguished by age-specific crite-ria, had not changed appreciably throughout most ofadulthood. In a more recent study of personality traits, Srivastava, John, Gosling, and Potter (2003) examined the \"bigfive\" personality trait dimensions in a large sample todetermine how personality changes over the life span.Age range of the subjects was from 21 to 60. The per-sonality traits tested included conscientiousness,agreeableness, neuroticism, openness, and extraver-sion. They found that conscientiousness (being organ-ized and disciplined) increased throughout the agerange studied, with the biggest increases during the20s. Agreeableness (being warm, generous, and help-ful) increased most during a person's 30s. Neuroticism(being anxious and emotionally labile) declined withage for women, but did not decline for men. Open-ness (being acceptable to new experiences) showedsmall declines with age for both men and women. Ex-troversion (being outwardly expressive and interestedin the environment) declined for women but did notshow changes in men. This study contradicts the viewthat personality traits tend to stop changing in earlyadulthood. These researchers suggest that personalitytraits change gradually but systematically throughoutthe life span. Developmental Task Theory Developmental tasks are the activities and challengesthat one must accomplish at specific stages in life toachieve successful aging. Erikson (1963) describedthe primary task of old age as being able to see one'slife as having been lived with integrity. In the absenceof achieving that sense of having lived well, the olderadult is at risk for becoming preoccupied with feel-ings of regret or despair. Disengagement Theory Disengagement theory describes the process of with- drawal by older adults from societal roles and respon-sibilities. According to the theory, this withdrawalprocess is predictable, systematic, inevitable, and nec-essary for the proper functioning of a growing society.Older adults were said to be happy when social con-tacts diminished and responsibilities were assumed bya younger generation. The benefit to the older adultis thought to be in providing time for reflecting onlife's accomplishments and for coming to terms withunfulfilled expectations. The benefit to society isthought to be an orderly transfer of power from oldto young. There have been many critics of this theory, and the postulates have been challenged. For manyhealthy and productive older individuals, theprospect of a slower pace and fewer responsibilities isundesirable. Activity Theory In direct opposition to the disengagement theory isthe activity theory of aging, which holds that the wayto age successfully is to stay active. Multiple studieshave validated the positive relationship between main-taining meaningful interaction with others and phys-ical and mental well-being. Sadock and Sadock (2007) suggested that social integration is the prime factor in determining psy-chosocial adaptation in later life. Social integrationrefers to how the aging individual is included andtakes part in the life and activities of his or her society.This theory holds that the maintenance of activitiesis important to most people as a basis for deriving andsustaining satisfaction, self-esteem, and health. Continuity Theory This theory, also known as the developmental theory, isa follow-up to the disengagement and activity theories.It emphasizes the individual's previously establishedCHAPTER 34 The Aging Individual 7514092_Ch34_747-776 23/07/14 12:46 PM Page 751coping abilities and personal character traits as a basis for predicting how the person will adjust to the changesof aging. Basic lifestyle characteristics are likely to re-main stable in old age, barring physical or other typesof complications that necessitate change. A person who has enjoyed the company of others and an activesocial life will continue to enjoy this lifestyle into oldage. One who has preferred solitude and a limitednumber of activities will probably find satisfaction in acontinuation of this lifestyle. Maintenance of internal continuity is motivated by the need for preservation of self-esteem, ego integrity,cognitive function, and social support. As they age, in-dividuals maintain their self-concept by reinterpretingtheir current experiences so that old values can takeon new meanings in keeping with present circum-stances. Internal self-concepts and beliefs are not read-ily vulnerable to environmental change, and externalcontinuity in skills, activities, roles, and relationshipscan remain remarkably stable into the 70s. Physical ill-ness or death of friends and loved ones may precludecontinued social interaction (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). The Normal Aging Process Biological Aspects of Aging Individuals are unique in their physical and psycho-logical aging processes, as influenced by their predis-position or resistance to illness; the effects of theirexternal environment and behaviors; their exposureto trauma, infections, and past diseases; and thehealth and illness practices they have adopted duringtheir life span. As the individual ages, there is a quan-titative loss of cells and changes in many of the enzy-matic activities within cells, resulting in a diminishedresponsiveness to biological demands made on thebody. Age-related changes occur at different rates fordifferent individuals, although in actuality, whengrowth stops, aging begins. This section presents abrief overview of the normal biological changes thatoccur with the aging process. Skin One of the most dramatic changes that occurs inaging is the loss of elastin in the skin. This effect, as well as changes in collagen, causes aged skin towrinkle and sag. Excessive exposure to sunlight com-pounds these changes and increases the risk of devel-oping skin cancer. Fat redistribution results in a loss of the subcuta- neous cushion of adipose tissue. Thus, older peoplelose \"insulation\" and are more sensitive to extremes ofambient temperature than are younger people (Stanley,Blair, & Beare, 2005). A diminished supply of bloodvessels to the skin results in a slower rate of healing.Cardiovascular System The age-related decline in the cardiovascular systemis thought to be the major determinant of decreasedtolerance for exercise and loss of conditioning andthe overall decline in energy reserve. The aging heartis characterized by modest hypertrophy and loss ofpacemaker cells, resulting in a decrease in maximalheart rate and diminished cardiac output (Blair,2012). This results in a decrease in response to workdemands and some diminishment of blood flow tothe brain, kidneys, liver, and muscles. Heart rate alsoslows with time. If arteriosclerosis is present, cardiacfunction is further compromised. Respiratory System Thoracic expansion is diminished by an increase infibrous tissue and loss of elastin. Pulmonary vital ca-pacity decreases, and the amount of residual air in-creases. Scattered areas of fibrosis in the alveolarsepta interfere with exchange of oxygen and carbondioxide. These changes are accelerated by the use ofcigarettes or other inhaled substances. Cough and la-ryngeal reflexes are reduced, causing decreased abil-ity to defend the airway. Decreased pulmonary bloodflow and diffusion ability result in reduced efficiencyin responding to sudden respiratory demands. Musculoskeletal System Skeletal aging involving the bones, muscles, ligaments,and tendons probably generates the most frequent limitations on activities of daily living experienced byaging individuals. Loss of muscle mass is significant, al-though this occurs more slowly in men than in women.Demineralization of the bones occurs at a rate of about1 percent per year throughout the life span in bothmen and women. However, this increases to approxi-mately 10 percent in women around menopause , making them particularly vulnerable to osteoporosis. Individual muscle fibers become thinner and less elastic with age. Muscles become less flexible follow-ing disuse. There is diminished storage of muscleglycogen, resulting in loss of energy reserve for increased activity. These changes are accelerated bynutritional deficiencies and inactivity. Gastrointestinal System In the oral cavity, the teeth show a reduction in dentineproduction, shrinkage and fibrosis of root pulp, gingi-val retraction, and loss of bone density in the alveolarridges. There is some loss of peristalsis in the stomachand intestines, and gastric acid production decreases.Levels of intrinsic factor may also decrease, resultingin vitamin B 12 malabsorption in some aging individuals. A significant decrease in absorptive surface area of thesmall intestine may be associated with some decline in752 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch34_747-776 23/07/14 12:46 PM Page 752nutrient absorption. Motility slowdown of the large in- testine, combined with poor dietary habits, dehydra-tion, lack of exercise, and some medications, may giverise to problems with constipation. There is a modest decrease in size and weight of the liver resulting in losses in enzyme activity required todeactivate certain medications by the liver. These age-related changes can influence the metabolism and ex-cretion of these medications. These changes, alongwith the pharmacokinetics of the drug, must be con-sidered when giving medications to aging individuals. Endocrine System A decreased level of thyroid hormones causes a low-ered basal metabolic rate. Decreased amounts ofadrenocorticotropic hormone may result in less efficient stress response. Impairments in glucose tolerance are evident in aging individuals. Studies of glucose challenges showthat insulin levels are equivalent to or slightly higherthan those from younger challenged individuals, al-though peripheral insulin resistance appears to playa significant role in carbohydrate intolerance. The ob-served glucose clearance abnormalities and insulinresistance in older people may be related to many fac-tors other than biological aging (e.g., obesity, familyhistory of diabetes) and may be influenced substan-tially by diet or exercise. Genitourinary System Age-related declines in renal function occur becauseof a steady attrition of nephrons and sclerosis withinthe glomeruli over time. Vascular changes affectblood flow to the kidneys, which results in reducedglomerular filtration and tubular function. Elderlypeople are prone to develop the syndrome of inap-propriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and levelsof blood urea nitrogen and creatinine may be ele-vated slightly. The overall decline in renal functioninghas serious implications for physicians who prescribemedications for elderly individuals. In men, enlargement of the prostate gland is com- mon as aging occurs. Prostatic hypertrophy is associatedwith an increased risk for urinary retention and may alsobe a cause of urinary incontinence (Johnston, Harper,& Landefeld, 2013). Loss of muscle and sphincter con-trol, as well as the use of some medications, may causeurinary incontinence in women. Not only is this prob-lem a cause of social stigma, but also, if left untreated, itincreases the risk of urinary tract infection and local skinirritation. Normal changes in the genitalia are discussedin the section \"Sexual Aspects of Aging.\" Immune System Aging results in changes in both cell-mediated andantibody-mediated immune responses. The size of thethymus gland declines continuously from just beyondpuberty to about 15 percent of its original size at age50. The consequences of these changes include agreater susceptibility to infections and a diminishedinflammatory response that results in delayed heal-ing. There is also evidence of an increase in variousautoantibodies as a person ages, increasing the risk ofautoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis(National Institutes of Health [NIH], 2012). Because of the overall decrease in efficiency of the immune system, the proliferation of abnormal cells isfacilitated in the elderly individual. Cancer is the bestexample of aberrant cells allowed to proliferate dueto the ineffectiveness of the immune system. Nervous System With aging, there is an absolute loss of neurons, whichcorrelates with decreases in brain weight of about 10 percent by age 90 (Murray et al., 2009). Gross mor-phological examination reveals gyral atrophy in thefrontal, and ventricular enlargement. However, it mustbe remembered that these changes have been identi-fied in careful study of adults with normal intellectualfunction. The brain has enormous reserve, and little cere- bral function is lost over time, although greater func-tional decline is noted in the periphery (Stanley et al.,2005). There appears to be a disproportionatelygreater loss of cells in the cerebellum, the locuscoeruleus, the substantia nigra, and olfactory bulbs,accounting for some of the more characteristic agingbehaviors such as mild gait disturbances, sleep disrup-tions, and decreased smell and taste perception. Some of the age-related changes within the nervous system may be due to alterations in neurotransmitterrelease, uptake, turnover, catabolism, or receptor func-tions (Beers & Jones, 2004; Blair, 2012). A great dealof attention is being given to brain biochemistry andin particular to the neurotransmitters acetylcholine,dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Thesebiochemical changes may be responsible for the al-tered responses of many older persons to stressfulevents and some biological treatments. Sensory Systems Vision Visual acuity begins to decrease in midlife. Presbyopia(blurred near vision) is the standard marker of aging ofthe eye. It is caused by a loss of elasticity of the crystallinelens, and results in compromised accommodation. Cataract development is inevitable if the individual lives long enough for the changes to occur. Cataractsoccur when the lens of the eye becomes less resilient(due to compression of fibers) and increasinglyCHAPTER 34 The Aging Individual 7534092_Ch34_747-776 23/07/14 12:46 PM Page 753opaque (as proteins lump together), ultimately result- ing in a loss of visual acuity. The color in the iris may fade, and the pupil may become irregular in shape. A decrease in productionof secretions by the lacrimal glands may cause drynessand result in increased irritation and infection. Thepupil may become constricted, requiring an increasein the amount of light needed for reading. Hearing Hearing changes significantly with the aging process.Gradually over time, the ear loses its sensitivity to dis-criminate sounds because of damage to the hair cellsof the cochlea. The most dramatic decline appears tobe in perception of high-frequency sounds. Age-related hearing loss, called presbycusis, is com- mon and affects more than half of all adults by age 75 years (Blevins, 2013). It is more common in menthan it is in women, a fact that may be related to differences in levels of lifetime noise exposure. Taste and Smell Taste sensitivity decreases over the life span. Taste dis-crimination decreases, and bitter taste sensations pre-dominate. Sensitivity to sweet and salty tastes isdiminished. The deterioration of the olfactory bulbs is accompa- nied by loss of smell acuity. The aromatic componentof taste perception diminishes. Touch and Pain Organized sensory nerve receptors on the skin con-tinue to decrease throughout the life span; thus, thetouch threshold increases with age (Pietraniec-Shannon, 2007). The ability to feel pain also decreasesin response to these changes, and the ability to per-ceive and interpret painful stimuli changes. Thesechanges have critical implications for the elderly intheir potential inability to use sensory warnings to escape serious injury. Psychological Aspects of Aging Memory Functioning Age-related memory deficiencies have been extensivelyreported in the literature. Although short-term mem- oryseems to deteriorate with age, perhaps because of poorer sorting strategies, long-term memory does not show similar changes. However, in nearly every in-stance, well-educated, mentally active people do notexhibit the same decline in memory functioning astheir age peers who lack similar opportunities to flextheir minds. Nevertheless, with few exceptions, thetime required for memory scanning is longer for bothrecent and remote recall among older people. Thiscan sometimes be attributed to social or health factors(e.g., stress, fatigue, illness), but it can also occur because of certain normal physical changes associatedwith aging (e.g., decreased blood flow to the brain). Intellectual Functioning There appears to be a high degree of regularity in in-tellectual functioning across the adult age span. Crys-tallized abilities, or knowledge acquired in the courseof the socialization process, tend to remain stable overthe adult life span. Fluid abilities, or abilities involvedin solving novel problems, tend to decline graduallyfrom young to old adulthood. In other words, intel-lectual abilities of older people do not decline but dobecome obsolete. The age of their formal educationalexperiences is reflected in their intelligence scoring. Learning Ability The ability to learn is not diminished by age. Studies,however, have shown that some aspects of learning dochange with age. The ordinary slowing of reactiontime with age for nearly all tasks or the over-arousalof the central nervous system may account for lowerperformance levels on tests requiring rapid re-sponses. Under conditions that allow for self-pacingby the participant, differences in accuracy of perform-ance diminish. Ability to learn continues throughoutlife, although strongly influenced by interests, activity,motivation, health, and experience. Adjustments doneed to be made in teaching methodology and timeallowed for learning. Adaptation to the Tasks of Aging Loss and Grief Individuals experience losses from the very beginningof life. By the time individuals reach their 60s and 70s,they have experienced numerous losses, and mourn-ing has become a lifelong process. Unfortunately, withthe aging process comes a convergence of losses, thetiming of which makes it impossible for the aging in-dividual to complete the grief process in response toone loss before another occurs. Because grief is cumu-lative, this can result in bereavement overload, which has been implicated in the predisposition to depres-sion in the elderly. Attachment to Others Many studies have confirmed the importance of in-terpersonal relationships at all stages in the life cycle.Murray and associates (2009) state: [Social networks] contribute to well-being of the elder by (a) promoting socialization and companionship, (b)elevating morale and life satisfaction, (c) buffering theeffects of stressful events, (d) providing a confidant,and (e) facilitating coping skills and mastery. (p. 620) This need for attachment is consistent with the ac- tivity theory of aging that correlates the importance754 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch34_747-776 23/07/14 12:46 PM Page 754of social integration with successful adaptation in later life. Maintenance of Self-Identity Self-concept and self-image appear to remain stableover time. Factors that have been shown to favor goodpsychosocial adjustment in later life are sustained fam-ily relationships, maturity of ego defenses, absence of alcoholism, and absence of depressive disorder(Vaillant, 2003). Studies show that the elderly have astrong need for and remarkable capability of retaininga persistent self-concept in the face of the manychanges that contribute to instability in later life. Dealing With Death Death anxiety among the aging is apparently more ofa myth than a reality. Studies have not supported thenegative view of death as an overriding psychologicalfactor in the aging process. Various investigators whohave worked with dying persons report that it is notdeath itself, but abandonment, pain, and confusionthat are feared. What many desire most is someoneto talk with, to show them their life's meaning is notshattered merely because they are about to die(K\u00fcbler-Ross, 1969; Murray et al., 2009). Psychiatric Disorders in Later Life The later years constitute a time of especially high riskfor emotional distress. Sadock and Sadock (2007) state: Several psychosocial risk factors predispose older people to mental disorders. These risk factors includeloss of social roles, loss of autonomy, the deaths offriends and relatives, declining health, increased iso-lation, financial constraints, and decreased cognitivefunctioning. (p. 1353) Neurocognitive Disorder Neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) are the most com- mon causes of psychopathology in the elderly. Abouthalf of these disorders are of the Alzheimer's type,which is characterized by an insidious onset and a grad-ually progressive course of cognitive impairment. Nocurative treatment is currently available. Symptomatictreatments, including pharmacological interventions,attention to the environment, and family support, canhelp to maximize the client's level of functioning. Delirium Delirium is one of the most common and critical formsof psychopathology in later life. A number of factorshave been identified that predispose elderly people todelirium, including structural brain disease, reducedcapacity for homeostatic regulation, impaired visionand hearing, a high prevalence of chronic disease, re-duced resistance to acute stress, and age-relatedchanges in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacody-namics of drugs. Delirium needs to be recognized andthe underlying condition treated as soon as possible.A high mortality rate is associated with this condition. Depression Depressive disorders are the most common affectiveillnesses occurring after the middle years. The inci-dence of increased depression among elderly peopleis influenced by the variables of physical illness, func-tional disability, cognitive impairment, and loss of aspouse (Lang, 2012). Somatic symptoms are commonin the depressed elderly. Symptomatology often mim-ics that of NCD, a condition that is referred to as pseu- dodementia . (See Table 22-1 for a comparison of the symptoms of NCD and pseudodementia.) Suicide isprevalent in the elderly, with declining health and de-creased economic status being considered importantinfluencing factors. Treatment of depression in theelderly individual is with psychotropic medications orelectroconvulsive therapy. Schizophrenia Schizophrenia and delusional disorders may continueinto old age or may manifest themselves for the firsttime only during senescence (Blazer, 2008). In mostinstances, individuals who manifest psychotic disor-ders early in life show a decline in psychopathologyas they age. Late-onset schizophrenia (after age 60)is not common, but when it does occur, it often ischaracterized by delusions or hallucinations of a per-secutory nature. The course is chronic, and treatmentis with neuroleptics and supportive psychotherapy.CHAPTER 34 The Aging Individual 755 IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE Helmes, E. & Wiancko, D.C. (2006). Effects of music in re- ducing disruptive behavior in a general hospital. Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association, 12(1), 37-44. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: In settings where cognitivelyimpaired elderly individuals reside, it is not uncommon forloud, disruptive vocalizations such as shouting and thebanging of objects to be heard. Studies have shown thatmusic can alleviate the tension and reduce the disruptivevocalizations of some individuals with dementia. Most re-ports on the effect of music on these disruptive outburstshave been conducted in residential care facilities. Becausethere are few studies about the prevalence of disruptive be-haviors or the method of dealing with them in the acute Continued4092_Ch34_747-776 23/07/14 12:46 PM Page 755Anxiety Disorders Most anxiety disorders begin in early to middle adult- hood, but some appear for the first time after age 60.Because the autonomic nervous system is more fragilein older persons, the response to a major stressor isoften quite intense. The presence of physical disabil-ity frequently compounds the situation, resulting in amore severe post-traumatic stress response than iscommonly observed in younger persons. In olderadults, symptoms of anxiety and depression often ac-company each other, making it difficult to determinewhich disorder is dominant. Personality Disorders Personality disorders are uncommon in the elderlypopulation. The incidence of personality disordersamong individuals over age 65 is less than 5 percent.Most elderly people with personality disorder havelikely manifested the symptomatology for many years. Sleep Disorders Sleep disorders are very common in the aging individ-ual. Sleep disturbances affect 50 percent of people age65 and older who live at home and 66 percent of thosewho live in long-term care facilities (Stanley et al.,2005). Some common causes of sleep disturbancesamong elderly people include age-dependent de-creases in the ability loneliness, inactivity, and boredom.Sedative-hypnotics, along with nonpharmacological approaches, are often used as sleep aids with the eld-erly. Changes in aging associated with metabolism andelimination must be considered when maintenancemedications are administered for chronic insomnia inthe aging client. Sociocultural Aspects of Aging Old age brings many important socially inducedchanges, some of which have the potential for nega-tive effect on both the physical and mental well-beingof older persons. In American society, old age is de-fined arbitrarily as being 65 years or older becausethat is the age when most people have been able toretire with full Social Security and other pension ben-efits. Recent legislation has increased the age beyond65 years for full Social Security benefits. Currently, theage increases yearly (based on year of birth) until2027, when the age for full benefits will be 67 yearsfor all individuals. Elderly people in virtually all cultures share some basic needs and interests. There is little doubt thatmost individuals choose to live the most satisfying lifepossible until their demise. They want protectionfrom hazards and release from the weariness of every-day tasks. They want to be treated with the respectand dignity that is deserving of individuals who havereached this pinnacle in life; and they want to die withthe same respect and dignity. From the beginning of human culture, the aged have had a special status in society. Even today, insome cultures the aged are the most powerful, the756 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations IMPLICATIONS FOR EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE\u2014 cont'd care setting, the authors sought to determine if soothing music found to be effective in residential settings could begeneralized to acute care environments. RESULTS OF THE STUDY: The study sample included 7 women and 2 men ranging in age from 68 to 95 years.Diagnoses were varied, including diabetes, pneumonia, alcoholic dementia, depression, Alzheimer's disease,Parkinson's dementia, stroke, and congestive heart failure.Length of hospital stays ranged from 1 day to 54 days. All exhibited disruptive behaviors, such as shouting andbanging of objects within reach, such as tray tables or bedrails. The intervention included the playing of baroquemusic in the client's room at a comfortable volume for the listener. Each of the participants was observed for aminimum of four 30-minute periods on a minimum of 3 successive days. Control trials with each participant werealso conducted in a randomized order to have at least twoobservations from each condition. Observations were madeunobtrusively, and routine activity of staff and visitors was notminimized during the course of the study. With all participants,the music intervention resulted in a decrease in frequency of noisy disruptive behaviors, with reductions ranging from30 to 90 percent, when compared with the control trials. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The use of music for its soothing and calming effect is a simple intervention well within the scope and capability of nursing practice. This studydid not pursue whether the benefits carry over after themusic has stopped, and whether more extensive use ofmusic would retain its effectiveness. The authors concluded,\"The use of music to reduce disruptive noise in an acute caresetting appears to be as effective as other such interventionshave been in residential care facilities.\" One additional benefitwas reported. The authors stated, \"Nurses on the two unitsnoted positive effects for them in the form of increasedpleasant affect that seemed to be independent of the effectsof reduced disruptive noise from the participants.\"4092_Ch34_747-776 23/07/14 12:46 PM Page 756most engaged, and the most respected members of the society. This has not been the case in the modernindustrial societies, although trends in the status ofthe aged differ widely between one industrializedcountry and another. For example, the status and in-tegration of the aged in Japan have remained rela-tively high when compared with other industrializednations, such as the United States. There are subcul-tures in the United States, however, in which the eld-erly are afforded a higher degree of status than theyreceive in the mainstream population. Examples in-clude Latino Americans, Asian Americans, andAfrican Americans. The aged are awarded a positionof honor in cultures that place emphasis on family cohesiveness. In these cultures, the aged are reveredfor their knowledge and wisdom gained through theiryears of life experiences (Purnell, 2013). Many negative stereotypes color the perspective on aging in the United States. Ideas that elderly individ-uals are always tired or sick, slow and forgetful, isolatedand lonely, unproductive, and angry determine theway younger individuals relate to the elderly in this society. Increasing disregard for the elderly has re-sulted in a type of segregation, as aging individuals voluntarily seek out or are involuntarily placed in special residences for the aged. Assisted living centers, retirement apartment com- plexes, and even entire retirement communities intended solely for individuals over age 50 are becom-ing more and more common. In 2012, more than half(59 percent) of persons age 65 and older lived in 12 states, with the largest numbers in California,Florida, New York, Texas, and Pennsylvania (AoA,2014). It is important for elderly individuals to feel partof an integrated group, and they are migrating to theseareas in an effort to achieve this integration. This phe-nomenon provides additional corroboration for the activity theory of aging, and the importance of attach-ment to others. Employment is another area in which the elderly experience discrimination. Although compulsory re-tirement has been virtually eliminated, discriminationstill exists in hiring and promotion practices. Manyemployers are not eager to retain or hire older work-ers. It is difficult to determine how much of the fail-ure to hire and promote results from discriminationbased on age alone and how much of it is related to arealistic and fair appraisal of the aged employee's abil-ity and efficiency. It is true that some elderly individ-uals are no longer capable of doing as good a job as ayounger worker; however, there are many who likelycan do a better job than their younger counterparts, if given the opportunity. Nevertheless, surveys haveshown that some employers accept the negativestereotypes about elderly individuals and believe thatolder workers are hard to please, set in their ways, lessproductive, frequently absent, and involved in moreaccidents. The status of the elderly may improve with time and as their numbers increase with the aging of the\"baby boomers.\" As older individuals gain politicalpower, the benefits and privileges designed for theelderly will increase. There is power in numbers, andthe 21st century promises power for people age 65and older. Sexual Aspects of Aging Sexuality and the sexual needs of elderly people arefrequently misunderstood, condemned, stereotyped,ridiculed, repressed, and ignored. Americans havegrown up in a society that has liberated sexual expres-sion for all other age groups, but still retains certainVictorian standards regarding sexual expression bythe elderly. Negative stereotyped notions concerningsexual interest and activity of the elderly are common.Some of these include ideas that older people haveno sexual interests or desires; that they are sexuallyundesirable; or that they are too fragile or too ill toengage in sexual activity. Some people even believe itis disgusting or comical to consider elderly individualsas sexual beings. These cultural stereotypes undoubtedly play a large part in the misperception many people hold re-garding sexuality of the aged, and they may be rein-forced by the common tendency of the young to denythe inevitability of aging. With reasonable goodhealth and an interesting and interested partner,there is no inherent reason why individuals shouldnot enjoy an active sexual life well into late adulthood(King, 2012). Physical Changes Associated With Sexuality Many of the changes in sexuality that occur in lateryears are related to the physical changes that are taking place at that time of life. Changes in Women Menopause may begin anytime during the 40s orearly 50s. During this time there is a gradual declinein the functioning of the ovaries and the subsequentproduction of estrogen, which results in a number ofchanges. The walls of the vagina become thin and in-elastic, the vagina itself shrinks in both width andlength, and the amount of vaginal lubrication de-creases noticeably. Orgasmic uterine contractionsmay become spastic. All of these changes can resultin painful penetration, vaginal burning, pelvic aching,or irritation on urination. In some women, the dis-comfort may be severe enough to result in an avoid-ance of intercourse. Paradoxically, these symptomsare more likely to occur with infrequent intercourseCHAPTER 34 The Aging Individual 7574092_Ch34_747-776 23/07/14 12:46 PM Page 757of only one time a month or less. Regular and more frequent sexual activity results in a greater capacityfor sexual performance (King, 2012). Other symp-toms that are associated with menopause in somewomen include hot flashes, night sweats, sleepless-ness, irritability, mood swings, migraine headaches,urinary incontinence, and weight gain. Some menopausal women elect to take hormone re- placement therapy for relief of these changes andsymptoms. With estrogen therapy, the symptoms ofmenopause are minimized or do not occur at all. How-ever, some women choose not to take the hormone be-cause of an increased risk of breast cancer, and whengiven alone, an increased risk of endometrial cancer.To combat this latter effect, many women also take asecond hormone, progesterone. Taken for 7 to 10 daysduring the month, progesterone decreases the risk ofestrogen-induced endometrial cancer. Some physiciansprescribe a low dose of progesterone that is taken,along with estrogen, for the entire month. A combina-tion pill, taken in this manner, is also available. Results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), as reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association, indicated that the combination pill is as- sociated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. Benefits related to coloncancer and osteoporosis were reported; however, in-vestigators stopped this arm of the study and sug-gested discontinuation of this type of therapy. In a3-year follow-up study of the participants, the resultsshowed that the increased risk for cardiovascular dis-ease dissipated with discontinuation of the hormonetherapy (Heiss et al., 2008). Changes in Men Testosterone production declines gradually over theyears, beginning between ages 40 and 60. A majorchange resulting from this hormone reduction is thaterections occur more slowly and require more directgenital stimulation to achieve. There may also be a modest decrease in the firmness of the erection in men older than age 60. The refractory periodlengthens with age, increasing the amount of timefollowing orgasm before the man may achieve another erection. The volume of ejaculate graduallydecreases, and the force of ejaculation lessens. Thetestes become somewhat smaller, but most men con-tinue to produce viable sperm well into old age. Pro-longed control over ejaculation in middle-aged andelderly men may bring increased sexual satisfactionfor both partners. Sexual Behavior in the Elderly Coital frequency in early marriage and the overallquantity of sexual activity between ages 20 and 40 cor-relate significantly with frequency patterns of sexualactivity during aging (Masters, Johnson, & Kolodny,1995). Although sexual interest and behavior do appear to decline somewhat with age, studies showthat significant numbers of elderly men and womenhave active and satisfying sex lives well into their 80s.A survey commissioned by the American Associationof Retired Persons (AARP) provided some revealinginformation regarding the sexual attitudes and be-havior of senior citizens. Some statistics from the sur-vey are summarized in Table 34-1. The informationfrom this survey clearly indicates that sexual activitycan and does continue well past the 70s for healthyactive individuals who have regular opportunities forsexual expression. King (2012) states: \"For healthymen and women with healthy partners, sexual activitywill probably continue throughout life if they had apositive attitude about sex when they were younger\"(p. 268).758 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations TABLE 34-1 Sexuality at Midlife and Beyond AGES MEN (%) WOMEN (%) Have sex at least once a week Repor t very satisfied with physical relationship Repor t very satisfied with emotional relationship Report sexual activity is important to their overall quality of life26 32245 PM Page 758Special Concerns of the Elderly Population Retirement Statistics reflect that a larger percentage of Americans are living longer and that many of them are retiringearlier. Reasons often given for the increasing patternof early retirement include health problems, Social Se-curity and other pension benefits, attractive \"early out\"packages offered by companies, and long-held plans(e.g., turning a hobby into a money-making situation). Studies show that about 10 to 20 percent of indi- viduals reenter the workforce following retirement(Cahill, Giandrea, & Quinn, 2011). Reentry is morecommon among men than women, and among thoseindividuals who are at a younger age and in goodhealth at the time of their retirement. Some reasonspeople give for returning to work following retire-ment include negative reactions to being retired, feel-ings of being unproductive, economic hardship, andloneliness. Recent downturns in economic conditionshave forced many retired people to seek employmentto augment dwindling retirement resources. About 8.1 million older Americans were in the labor force (working or actively seeking work) in2013. These included 4.5 million men and 3.6 millionwomen, and constituted 5 percent of the U.S. laborforce (AoA, 2014). Retirement has both social and economic implica- tions for elderly individuals. The role is fraught witha great deal of ambiguity and is one that requiresmany adaptations on the part of those involved. Social Implications Retirement is often anticipated as an achievement inprinciple, but met with mixed feelings when it actu-ally occurs. Our society places a great deal of impor-tance on productivity, making as much money aspossible, and doing it at as young an age as possible.These types of values contribute to the ambiguity as-sociated with retirement. Although leisure has beenacknowledged as a legitimate reward for workers,CHAPTER 34 The Aging Individual 759 TABLE 34-1 Sexuality at Midlife and Beyond\u2014cont'd AGES MEN (%) WOMEN (%) Believe non-marital sex is okay Describe their partners as physically attractive Repor t always or usually having an orgasm with sexual intercourse Report being impotentReport having used medicine, hormones, or other treatments to improve sexual functioning What would most improve your sex life?33 12 86 757161 60 485848 70 645961 9 161413 part- ner initiatessex moreoften; lessstress Adapted from American Association of Retired Persons.

Washington, DC: Author.4092_Ch34_747-776 23/07/14 12:46 PM Page 759leisure during retirement historically has lacked the same social value. Adjustment to this life-cycle eventbecomes more difficult in the face of societal valuesthat are in direct conflict with the new lifestyle. Historically, many women have derived a good deal of their self-esteem from their families\u2014birthingthem, rearing them, and being a \"good mother.\" Like-wise, many men have achieved self-esteem throughwork-related activities\u2014creativity, productivity, andearning money. With the termination of these activi-ties may come a loss of self-worth, resulting in depres-sion in some individuals who are unable to adaptsatisfactorily. Well-being in retirement is linked to fac-tors such as stable health status and access to health-care services, adequate income, the ability to pursuenew goals or activities, extended social network offamily and friends, and satisfaction with current livingarrangements (Murray et al., 2009). American society often identifies an individual by his or her occupation. This is reflected in the conver-sation of people who are meeting each other for thefirst time. Undoubtedly, most everyone has eitherasked or been asked at some point in time, \"What doyou do?\" or \"Where do you work?\" Occupation deter-mines status, and retirement represents a significantchange in status. The basic ambiguity of retirementoccurs in an individual's or society's definition of thischange. Is it undertaken voluntarily or involuntarily?Is it desirable or undesirable? Is one's status made better or worse by the change? In looking at the trend of the past 2 decades, we may presume that retirement is becoming, and willcontinue to become, more accepted by societal stan-dards. With many individuals retiring earlier and liv-ing longer, a growing number of aging people willspend a significantly longer time in retirement. It is amajor life event that requires planning and realisticexpectations of life changes. Economic Implications Because retirement is generally associated with a 20to 40 percent reduction in personal income, the stan-dard of living after retirement may be adversely af-fected. Most older adults derive post-retirementincome from a combination of Social Security bene-fits, public and private pensions, and income fromsavings or investments. In 2012, the median income in households con- taining families headed by persons 65 or older was$48,957 and more than 3.9 million elderly peoplewere below the poverty level (AoA, 2014). The rate ofthose living in poverty was higher among women thanmen and higher among African Americans andLatino Americans than whites. The Social Security Act of 1935 promised assis- tance with financial security for the elderly. Sincethen, the original legislation has been modified, yetthe basic philosophy remains intact. Its effective-ness, however, is now being questioned. Faced withdeficits, the program is forced to pay benefits tothose currently retired from both the reserve fundsand monies being collected at present. There is genuine concern about future generations, whenthere may be no reserve funds from which to draw.Because many of the programs that benefit olderadults depend on contributions from the youngerpopulation, the growing ratio of older Americans toyounger people may affect society's ability to supplythe goods and services necessary to meet this ex-panding demand. Medicare and Medicaid were established by the government to provide medical care benefits for elderly and indigent Americans. The Medicaid pro-gram is jointly funded by state and federal govern-ments, and coverage varies significantly from state tostate. Medicare covers only a percentage of health-care costs; therefore, to reduce risk related to out-of-pocket expenditures, many older adults purchaseprivate \"medigap\" policies designed to cover chargesin excess of those approved by Medicare. The magnitude of retirement earnings depends almost entirely on pre-retirement income. The poorwill remain poor and the wealthy are unlikely to lowertheir status during retirement; however, for many inthe middle classes, the relatively fixed income sourcesmay be inadequate, possibly forcing them to face financial hardship for the first time in their lives. Long-Term Care Stanley and associates (2005) stated, \"The concept oflong-term care covers a broad spectrum of compre-hensive health care that addresses both illness andwellness and the support services necessary to providethe physical, social, spiritual, and economic needs ofpersons with chronic illnesses, including disabilities\"(p. 94). Long-term care facilities are defined by thelevel of care they provide. They may be skilled nursingfacilities, intermediate care facilities, or a combina-tion of the two. Some institutions provide convales-cent care for individuals recovering from acute illnessor injury, some provide long-term care for individualswith chronic illness or disabilities, and still others provide both types of assistance. Most elderly individuals prefer to remain in their own homes or in the homes of family members for aslong as this can meet their needs without deteriora-tion of family or social patterns. Many elderly individ-uals are placed in institutions as a last resort only afterheroic efforts have been made to keep them in theirown or a relative's home. The increasing emphasis onhome health care has extended the period of inde-pendence for aging individuals.760 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch34_747-776 23/07/14 12:46 PM Page 760Fewer than 5 percent of the population ages 65 and older live in nursing homes. The percentage in- creases dramatically with age, ranging from 1 percentfor persons aged 65 to 74, to 3 percent for personsaged 75 to 84, and to 10 percent for persons aged 85and older (AoA, 2014). A profile of the \"typical\" eld-erly nursing home resident is about 80 years of age,white, female, widowed, with multiple chronic healthconditions. Risk Factors for Institutionalization In determining who in our society will need long-termcare, several factors have been identified that appearto place people at risk. The following risk factors aretaken into consideration to predict potential need forservices and to estimate future costs. Age Because people grow older in very different ways, andthe range of differences becomes greater with the pas-sage of time, age is becoming a less relevant charac-teristic than it was historically. However, because ofthe high prevalence of chronic health conditions anddisabilities, as well as the greater chance of diminish-ing social supports associated with advancing age, the65-and-older population is often viewed as an impor-tant long-term care target group. Health Level of functioning, as determined by ability to per-form various behaviors or activities\u2014such as bathing,eating, mobility, meal preparation, handling finances,judgment, and memory\u2014is a measurable risk factor.The need for ongoing assistance from another personis critical in determining the need for long-term care. Mental Health Status Mental health problems are risk factors in assessingneed for long-term care. Many of the symptoms asso-ciated with certain mental disorders (especially neu-rocognitive disorders), such as memory loss, impairedjudgment, impaired intellect, and disorientation,would render the individual incapable of meeting thedemands of daily living independently. Socioeconomic and Demographic Factors Low income generally is associated with greater physical and mental health problems among the elderly. Because many elderly individuals have limitedfinances, they are less able to purchase care resourcesavailable outside of institutions (e.g., home healthcare), although Medicare and Medicaid now con-tribute a limited amount to this type of noninstitu-tionalized care. Women are at greater risk of being institutionalized than men, not because they are less healthy but be-cause they tend to live longer and, thus, reach the ageat which more functional and cognitive impairmentsoccur. They are also more likely to be widowed. Whiteshave a higher rate of institutionalization than non-whites. This may be related to cultural and financialinfluences. Marital Status, Living Arrangement, and the Informal Support Network Individuals who are married and live with a spouse are the least likely of all disabled people to be institu-tionalized. Those who live alone without resources forhome care and with few or no relatives living nearbyto provide informal care are at higher risk for institu-tionalization. Attitudinal Factors Many people dread the thought of even visiting anursing home, let alone moving to one or placing arelative in one. Negative perceptions exist of nursinghomes as \"places to go to die.\" The media picture andsubsequent reputation of nursing homes has notbeen positive. Stories of substandard care and patientabuse have scarred the industry, making it difficult forthose facilities that are clean, well-managed, and thatprovide innovative, quality care to their residents torise above the stigma. State and national licensing boards perform peri- odic inspections to ensure that standards set forth bythe federal government are being met. These stan-dards address quality of patient care as well as ade-quacy of the nursing home facility. Yet, many elderlyindividuals and their families perceive nursing homesas a place to go to die, and the fact that many of theseinstitutions are poorly equipped, understaffed, anddisorganized keeps this societal perception alive.There are, however, many excellent nursing homesthat strive to go beyond the minimum federal regula-tions for Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement. Inaddition to medical, nursing, rehabilitation, and den-tal services, social and recreational services are pro-vided to increase the quality of life for elderly peopleliving in nursing homes. These activities include play-ing cards, other games; movies; arts, crafts, andother classes. Some nursing homes provide occupa-tional and professional counseling. These facilitiesstrive to enhance opportunities for improving qualityof life and for becoming \"places to live,\" rather than\"places to die.\" Elder Abuse Abuse of elderly individuals, which at times has beenreferred to in the media as \"granny -bashing ,\" is a serious form of family violence. Statistics regardingthe prevalence of elder abuse are difficult to deter-mine. It is estimated that annually up to 2 millionolder adults in the United States are victims of abuseCHAPTER 34 The Aging Individual 7614092_Ch34_747-776 23/07/14 12:46 PM Page 761(Stark, 2012). However, the data suggest that only about 84 percent of these cases are reported to au-thorities. The abuser is often a relative who lives withthe elderly person and may be the assigned caregiver.Typical caregivers who are likely to be abusers of theelderly were described by Murray and associates(2009) as being under economic stress, substanceabusers, themselves the victims of previous family violence, and exhausted and frustrated by the care-giver role. Identified risk factors for victims of abuseincluded being a white female age 70 or older, beingmentally or physically impaired, being unable to meetdaily self-care needs, and having care needs that exceeded the caretaker's ability. Abuse of elderly individuals may be psychological, physical, or financial. Neglect may be intentional or un-intentional. Psychological abuse includes yelling, insult-ing, harsh commands, threats, silence, and socialisolation. Physical abuse is described as striking, shov-ing, beating, or restraint. Financial abuse refers to misuse or theft of finances, property, or material pos-sessions. Neglect implies failure to fulfill the physicalneeds of an individual who cannot do so independently.Unintentional neglect is inadvertent, whereas inten-tional neglect is deliberate. In addition, elderly individ-uals may be the victims of sexual abuse, which is sexualintimacy between two persons that occurs without theconsent of one of the persons involved. Another typeof abuse, which has been called \"granny -dumping \" by the media, involves abandoning elderly individuals atemergency departments, nursing homes, or other facil-ities\u2014literally leaving them in the hands of others whenthe strain of caregiving becomes intolerable. Types ofelder abuse are summarized in Box 34-1.Elder victims often minimize the abuse or deny that it has occurred. The elderly person may be un-willing to disclose information because of fear of re-taliation, embarrassment about the existence of abusein the family, protectiveness toward a family member,or unwillingness to institute legal action. Adding tothis unwillingness to report is the fact that infirm eld-ers are often isolated so their mistreatment is lesslikely to be noticed by those who might be alert tosymptoms of abuse. For these reasons, detection ofabuse in the elderly is difficult at best. Factors That Contribute to Abuse A number of contributing factors have been impli-cated in the abuse of elderly individuals. Longer Life The 65-and-older age group has become the fastestgrowing segment of the population. Within this seg-ment, the number of elderly older than age 75 has in-creased most rapidly. This trend is expected tocontinue well into the 21st century. The 75-and-olderage group is the one most likely to be physically ormentally impaired, requiring assistance and care fromfamily members. This group also is the most vulnera-ble to abuse from caregivers. Dependency Dependency appears to be the most common precon-dition in domestic abuse. Changes associated withnormal aging or induced by chronic illness often re-sult in loss of self-sufficiency in the elderly person, requiring that they become dependent on anotherfor assistance with daily functioning. Long life mayalso consume finances to the point that the elderly 762 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations BOX 34-1 Examples of Elder Abuse PHYSICAL ABUSE Striking, hitting, beatingShovingBruisingCuttingRestraining PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE YellingInsulting, name-callingHarsh commandsThreats Ignoring, silence, social isolationW ithholding of affection NEGLECT (INTENTIONAL OR UNIN T ENTIONAL) Withholding food and waterInadequate heatingUnclean clothes and beddingLack of needed medicationLack of eyeglasses, hearing aids, false teeth FINANCIAL ABUSE OR EXPLOITATION Misuse of the elderly person's income by the caregiverForcing the elderly person to sign over financial affairs to an- other person against his or her will or without sufficientknowledge about the transaction SEXU AL ABUSE Sexual molestation; rape Any type of sexual intimacy against the elderly person's will SOURCES: Murray, Zentner, & Yakimo (2009), (2005).4092_Ch34_747-776 23/07/14 12:46 PM Page 762individual becomes financially dependent on another as well. This type of dependency also increases theelderly person's vulnerability to abuse. Stress The stress inherent in the caregiver role is a factor inmost abuse cases. Some clinicians believe that elderabuse results from individual or family psychopathol-ogy. Others suggest that even psychologically healthyfamily members can become abusive as the result ofthe exhaustion and acute stress caused by overwhelm-ing caregiving responsibilities. This is compoundedin an age group that has been dubbed the \"sandwichgeneration\"\u2014those individuals who elected to delaychildbearing so that they are now at a point in theirlives when they are \"sandwiched\" between providingcare for their children and providing care for theiraging parents. Learned Violence Children who have been abused or witnessed abusiveand violent parents are more likely to evolve into abu-sive adults. In some families, abusive behavior is thenormal response to tension or conflict, and this typeof behavior can be transmitted from one generationto another. There may be some unresolved familyconflicts or retaliation for previous maltreatment thatfoster and promote abuse of the elderly person. Identifying Elder Abuse Because so many elderly individuals are reluctant toreport personal abuse, health-care workers need tobe able to detect signs of mistreatment when they are in a position to do so. Box 34-1 listed a numberof types of elder abuse. The following manifestations of the various categories of abuse have been identified(Koop, 2012; Murray et al., 2009; Stanley et al., 2005): Indicators of psychological abuse include a broadrange of behaviors such as the symptoms associatedwith depression, withdrawal, anxiety, sleep disor-ders, and increased confusion or agitation. Indicators of physical abuse may include bruises,welts, lacerations, burns, punctures, evidence ofhair pulling, and skeletal dislocations and fractures. Neglect may be manifested as consistent hunger,poor hygiene, inappropriate dress, consistent lackof supervision, consistent fatigue or listlessness, un-attended physical problems or medical needs, orabandonment. Sexual abuse may be suspected when the elderlyperson is presented with pain or itching in the gen-ital area; bruising or bleeding in external genitalia,vaginal, or anal areas; or unexplained sexuallytransmitted disease. Financial abuse may be occurring when there is an obvious disparity between assets and satisfactoryliving conditions or when the elderly person com-plains of a sudden lack of sufficient funds for dailyliving expenses. Health-care workers often feel intimidated when confronted with cases of elder abuse. In these in-stances, referral to an individual experienced in man-agement of victims of such abuse may be the mosteffective approach to evaluation and intervention.Health-care workers are responsible for reportingany suspicions of elder abuse. An investigation is thenconducted by regulatory agencies, whose job it is todetermine if the suspicions are corroborated. Everyeffort must be made to ensure the client's safety, butit is important to remember that a competent elderlyperson has the right to choose his or her health-careoptions. As inappropriate as it may seem, some eld-erly individuals choose to return to the abusive situ-ation. In this instance, he or she should be providedwith names and phone numbers to call for assistanceif needed. A follow-up visit by an adult protectiveservices representative should be conducted. Increased efforts need to be made to ensure that health-care providers have comprehensive training inthe detection of and intervention in elder abuse.More research is needed to increase knowledge andunderstanding of the phenomenon of elder abuseand ultimately to effect more sophisticated strategiesfor prevention, intervention, and treatment. Suicide Although persons ages 65 and older comprise only13.7 percent of the population, they represent a dis-proportionately high percentage of individuals whocommit suicide. Of all suicides, more than 15 percentare committed by this age group (NCHS, 2012b). Thegroup especially at risk appears to be white men. Pre-disposing factors include loneliness, financial prob-lems, physical illness, loss, and depression (Sadock &Sadock, 2007). Although the rate of suicide among the elderly re- mains high, the numbers of suicides among this agegroup dropped steadily from 1930 to 1980. Investiga-tors who study these trends surmise that this declinewas due to increases in services for older people andan understanding of their problems in society. Statis-tics show that from 1980 to 1986, the number of sui-cides among people ages 65 and older increased by25 percent, which suggests that there are other con-tributing factors to the problem. However, since 1987,there has been a gradual decline in the number ofelderly suicides. It has been suggested that increased social isolation may be a contributing factor to suicide among the eld-erly. The number of elderly individuals who are divorced,widowed, or otherwise living alone has increased. MenCHAPTER 34 The Aging Individual 7634092_Ch34_747-776 23/07/14 12:46 PM Page 763seem especially vulnerable after the loss of a spouse, with a relative risk three times that of married men (O'Connell, Chin, Cunningham, & Lawlor, 2004). The National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH] (2010) suggests that major depression is a significantpredictor of suicide in older adults. Unfortunately, itis widely underrecognized and undertreated by themedical community. The NIMH (2010) states: Studies show that many older adults who die by suicide\u2014up to 75 percent\u2014visited a physician withina month before death .These findings point to the urgency of improving detection and treatment of de-pression to reduce suicide risk among older adults. Many elderly individuals express symptoms associ- ated with depression that are never recognized as such. Any sign of helplessness or hopelessness shouldelicit a supportive intervening response. Stanley andassociates (2005) suggest that, in assessing suicide intention, while using concern and compassion, di-rect questions such as the following should be asked: Have you thought life is not worth living? Have you considered harming yourself?Do you have a plan for hurting yourself? Have you ever acted on that plan? Have you ever attempted suicide? Components of intervention with a suicidal elderly person should include demonstrations of genuineconcern, interest, and caring; indications of empathyfor their fears and concerns; and help in identifying,clarifying, and formulating a plan of action to dealwith the unresolved issue. If the elderly person's behavior seems particularly lethal, additional familyor staff coverage and contact should be arranged toprevent isolation. Application of the Nursing Process Assessment Assessment of the elderly individual may follow thesame framework used for all adults, but with consid-eration of the possible biological, psychological, soci-ocultural, and sexual changes that occur in the normalaging process described previously in this chapter. Inno other area of nursing is it more important for764 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE Turvey, C.L., Conwell, Y., Jones, M.P., Phillips, C., Simonsick, E., Pearson, J.L., & Wallace, R. (2002). Risk factors for late-life suicide: A prospective, community-based study.American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, 398-406. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: Studies have suggested thata negative or depressive mental outlook, being widowedor divorced, sleeping more than 9 hours per day, and drink-ing more than three alcoholic beverages per day were riskfactors for late-life suicide. The primary aim of this studywas to examine the relationship between completed sui-cide in late life and physical health, disability, and socialsupport. The participants were 14,456 individuals selectedfrom a general population of elderly subjects age 65 andolder. Control subjects were a group of 420 individuals whowere matched by age and sex. It was a 10-year longitudinalstudy beginning in 1981. Variables were assessed at base-line, year 3, and year 6, with a 10-year mortality follow-up.Baseline variables included sleep quality, social support, alcohol use, medical illness, physical impairment, cognitiveimpairment, and depressive symptoms. RESULTS OF THE STUDY: The 10-year mortality follow-up in- dicated that 75 percent of the control subjects had died, but none had died from suicide. Twenty-one of the 14,456participants committed suicide within the follow-up period.Twenty of the 21 suicide victims were male. Average age was 78.6 years, with a range from 67 to 90 years. Themost common means was gunshot. Other means in-cluded hanging, cutting, overdose, drowning, carbonmonoxide inhalation, and one participant jumped to hisdeath. In this study, presence of friends or relatives to confide in was negatively associated with suicide. Likewise,regular church attendance was more common in controlsubjects than the participant sample, indicating an evenwider range of community support. Those who committedsuicide had reported more depressive symptoms thanthose who did not, but they did not consume more alcohol(inconsistent with previous studies). Poor sleep quality was positively correlated with suicide in this study, but nospecific physical illness was identified as a predisposition.The authors identify the small suicide sample as a limitationof this study. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: This study identified depression, poor sleep quality, and limited social support as important variables in the potential for elderly suicide. Sleepdisturbance may be an important indicator of depression,whereas limited social support may be a contributing factor.The study provides reinforcement for the U.S. Departmentof Health and Human Services (USDHHS) recommenda-tion in their National Strategy for Suicide Prevention: Goals and Objectives for Action (2001). The USDHHS recom- mends detection and treatment of depression as a strategyto prevent late-life suicide. The authors stated, \"Becauseboth depression and social support are amenable to inter-vention, this study provides further evidence for the possibleeffectiveness of such strategies to reduce suicides amongolder adults.\" Nurses can become actively involved in as-sessing for these risk factors, as well as planning, implement-ing, and evaluating the effectiveness of strategies forpreventing suicide in the elderly population.4092_Ch34_747-776 23/07/14 12:47 PM Page 764nurses to practice holistic nursing than with the eld- erly. Older adults are likely to have multiple physicalproblems that contribute to problems in other areasof their lives. Obviously, these components cannot beaddressed as separate entities. Nursing the elderly is amultifaceted, challenging process because of the mul-tiple changes occurring at this time in the life cycleand the way in which each change affects every aspectof the individual. Several considerations are unique to assessment of the elderly. Assessment of the older person's thoughtprocesses is a primary responsibility. Knowledge aboutthe presence and extent of disorientation or confu-sion will influence the way in which the nurse ap-proaches elder care. Information about sensory capabilities is also ex- tremely important. Because hearing loss is common,the nurse should lower the pitch and loudness of hisor her voice when addressing the older person. Look-ing directly into the face of the older person when talk-ing facilitates communication. Questions that requirea declarative sentence in response should be asked; inthis way, the nurse is able to assess the client's ability touse words correctly. Visual acuity can be determinedby assessing adaptation to the dark, color matching,and the perception of color contrast. Knowledge aboutthese aspects of sensory functioning is essential in thedevelopment of an effective care plan. The nurse should be familiar with the normal phys- ical changes associated with the aging process. Exam-ples of some of these changes include the following: Less effective response to changes in environmen-tal temperature, resulting in hypothermia. Decreases in oxygen use and the amount of bloodpumped by the heart, resulting in cerebral anoxiaor hypoxia. Skeletal muscle wasting and weakness, resulting indifficulty in physical mobility. Limited cough and laryngeal reflexes, resulting inrisk of aspiration. Demineralization of bones, resulting in sponta-neous fracturing. Decrease in gastrointestinal motility, resulting inconstipation. Decrease in the ability to interpret painful stimuli,resulting in risk of injury. Common psychosocial changes associated with aging include the following: Prolonged and exaggerated grief, resulting in depression. Physical changes, resulting in disturbed bodyimage. Changes in status, resulting in loss of self-worth. This list is by no means exhaustive. The nurse should consider many other alterations in his or herassessment of the client. Knowledge of the client'sfunctional capabilities is essential for determining thephysiological, psychological, and sociological needsof the elderly individual. Age alone does not pre-clude the occurrence of all these changes. The agingprocess progresses at a wide range of variance, andeach client must be assessed as a unique individual. Diagnosis/Outcome Identification Virtually any nursing diagnosis may be applicable to theaging client, depending on individual needs for assis-tance. Based on normal changes that occur in the eld-erly, the following nursing diagnoses may be considered: Physiologically Related Diagnoses Risk for trauma related to confusion, disorientation,muscular weakness, spontaneous fractures, falls Hypothermia related to loss of adipose tissue underthe skin, evidenced by increased sensitivity to coldand body temperature below 98.6F Decreased cardiac output related to decreased myocardial efficiency secondary to age-relatedchanges, evidenced by decreased tolerance for ac-tivity and decline in energy reserve Ineffective breathing pattern related to increase in fibrous tissue and loss of elasticity in lung tissue,evidenced by dyspnea and activity intolerance Risk for aspiration related to diminished coughand laryngeal reflexes Impaired physical mobility related to muscularwasting and weakness, evidenced by need for assis-tance in ambulation Imbalanced nutrition, less than body requirements,related to inefficient absorption from gastrointestinaltract, difficulty chewing and swallowing, anorexia,difficulty in feeding self, evidenced by wasting syn-drome, anemia, weight loss Constipation related to decreased motility; inade-quate diet; insufficient activity or exercise, evi-denced by decreased bowel sounds; hard, formedstools; or straining at stool Stress urinary incontinence related to degenerativechanges in pelvic muscles and structural supportsassociated with increased age, evidenced by re-ported or observed dribbling with increased ab-dominal pressure or urinary frequency Urinary retention related to prostatic enlargement,evidenced by bladder distention, frequent voiding ofsmall amounts, dribbling, or overflow incontinence Disturbed sensory perception related to age-relatedalterations in sensory transmission, evidenced bydecreased visual acuity, hearing loss, diminishedsensitivity to taste and smell, or increased touchthreshold.

The client: Has not experienced injury. Maintains reality orientation consistent with cogni-tive level of functioning. Manages own self-care with assistance. Expresses positive feelings about self, past accom-plishments, and hope for the future. Compensates adaptively for diminished sensoryperception. Caregivers: Can problem-solve effectively regarding care of theelderly client. Demonstrate adaptive coping strategies for dealingwith stress of caregiver role. Openly express feelings. Express desire to join a support group of othercaregivers. Planning/Implementation In Table 34-2, selected nursing diagnoses are pre-sented for the elderly client. Outcome criteria are in-cluded, along with appropriate nursing interventionsand rationale for each. Reminiscence therapy is especially helpful with elderly clients. This therapeutic intervention is high-lighted in Box 34-2. Evaluation Reassessment is conducted to determine if thenursing actions have been successful in achievingthe objectives of care. Evaluation of the nursing ac-tions for the elderly client may be facilitated bygathering information using the following types ofquestions: Has the client escaped injury from falls, burns, orother means to which he or she is vulnerable be-cause of age? Can caregivers verbalize means of providing a safeenvironment for the client? Does the client maintain reality orientation at anoptimum for his or her cognitive functioning? Can the client distinguish between reality-basedand non-reality-based thinking? Can caregivers verbalize ways in which to orientclient to reality, as needed?766 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch34_747-776 23/07/14 12:47 PM Page 766CHAPTER 34 The Aging Individual 767 Continued Table 34-2 | CARE PLAN FOR THE ELDERLY CLIENT NURSING DIAGNOSIS: RISK FOR TRAUMA RELATED TO: Confusion, disorientation, muscular weakness, spontaneous fractures, falls OUTCOME CRITERIA NURSING INTERVENTIONS RATIONALE Short-Term Goals \u0081 Client will call for assistance when ambulating or carrying out other activities. \u0081 Client will not experience injury.

BOX 34-2 Reminiscence Therapy and Life Review With the Elderly Stanley, Blair, and Beare (2005) stated: Stimulation of life memories helps older adults to work through their losses and maintain self-esteem. Life re-view provides older adults with an opportunity to cometo grips with guilt and regrets, and to emerge feelinggood about themselves. (p. 268) Studies have indicated that reminiscence , or thinking about the past and reflecting on it, may promote better men- tal health in old age. Life review is related to reminiscence, but differs from it in that it is a more guided or directed cog-nitive process that constructs a history or story in an autobi-ographical way (Murray et al., 2009). Elderly individuals who spend time thinking about the past experience an increase in self-esteem and are less likely tosuffer depression. Some psychologists believe that life reviewmay help some people adjust to memories of an unhappypast. Others view reminiscence and life review as ways tobolster feelings of well-being, particularly in older people whocan no longer remain active. Reminiscence therapy can take place on a one-to-one basis or in a group setting. In reminiscence groups, elderlyindividuals share significant past events with peers. The nurseleader facilitates the discussion of topics that deal with spe-cific life transitions, such as childhood, adolescence, marriage,childbearing, grandparenthood, and retirement. Membersshare both positive and negative aspects, including personalfeelings, about these life-cycle events.Reminiscence on a one-to-one basis can provide a way for elderly individuals to work through unresolved issues fromthe past. Painful issues may be too difficult to discuss in thegroup setting. As the individual reviews his or her life process,the nurse can validate feelings and help the elderly clientcome to terms with painful issues that may have been longsuppressed. This process is necessary if the elderly individualis to maintain (or attain) a sense of positive identity and self-esteem and ultimately achieve the goal of ego integrity asdescribed by Erikson (1963). A number of creative measures can be used to facilitate life review with the elderly individual. Having the client keepa journal for sharing may be a way to stimulate discussion(as well as providing a permanent record of past events forsignificant others). Pets, music, and special foods have a wayof provoking memories from the client's past. Photographsof family members and past significant events are an excel-lent way of guiding the elderly client through his or her au-tobiographical review. Care must be taken in the life review to assist clients to work through unresolved issues. Anxiety, guilt, depression,and despair may result if the individual is unable to workthrough the problems and accept them. Life review can workin a negative way if the individual comes to believe that hisor her life was meaningless. However, it can be a very posi-tive experience for the person who can take pride in past ac-complishments and feel satisfied with his or her life, resultingin a sense of serenity and inner peace in the older adult.

Summary and Key Points Care of the aging individual presents one of thegreatest challenges for nursing. The growing population of individuals aged 65 andolder suggests that the challenge will progress wellinto the 21st century. America is a youth-oriented society. It is not desir-able to be old in this culture. In some cultures, the elderly are revered and hold a special place of honor within the society, butin highly industrialized countries such as theUnited States, status declines with the decrease inproductivity and participation in the mainstreamof society. Individuals experience many changes as they age.Physical changes occur in virtually every body system. Psychologically, there may be age-related memorydeficiencies, particularly for recent events.Intellectual functioning does not decline withage, but length of time required for learning increases. Aging individuals experience many losses, poten-tially leading to bereavement overload. They are vulnerable to depression and to feelings of lowself-worth. The elderly population represents a disproportion-ately high percentage of individuals who commitsuicide. Neurocognitive disorders are the most frequentcauses of psychopathology in the elderly. Sleep dis-orders are very common. The need for sexual expression by the elderly is oftenmisunderstood within our society. Although manyphysical changes occur at this time of life that alteran individual's sexuality, if he or she has reasonablygood health and a willing partner, sexual activity cancontinue well past the 70s for most people. Retirement has both social and economic implica-tions for elderly individuals. Society often equatesan individual's status with occupation, and loss ofemployment may result in the need for adjustmentin the standard of living because retirement in-come may be reduced by 20 to 40 percent of pre-retirement earnings. Less than 5 percent of the population ages 65 andolder live in nursing homes. A profile of the typicalelderly nursing home resident is a white womanabout 80 years old, widowed, with multiple chronichealth conditions. Much stigma is attached to whatsome still call \"rest homes\" or \"old age homes,\" andmany elderly people still equate them with a place\"to go to die.\" The strain of the caregiver role has become a majordilemma in our society. Elder abuse is sometimesinflicted by caregivers for whom the role has become overwhelming and intolerable. There is anintense need to find assistance for these people,who must provide care for their loved ones on a 24-hour basis. Home health care, respite care, sup-port groups, and financial assistance are needed toease the burden of this role strain. Caring for elderly individuals requires a specialkind of inner strength and compassion. The poemthat follows conveys a vital message for nurses.772 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations Additional info available at www.davisplus.com4092_Ch34_747-776 23/07/14 12:47 PM Page 772CHAPTER 34 The Aging Individual 4092_Ch34_747-776 23/07/14 12:48 PM Page 773774 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

Books, newspapers, movies, and television inundate their readers and viewers with stories of \"man's inhumanity to man\" (nogender bias intended). Nearly 3 in 10 women and 1 in 10 men in the United States report having been the victim of inti-mate partner violence (Centers for Disease Controland Prevention [CDC], 2012a). More injuries are at-tributed to intimate partner violence than to all rapes,muggings, and automobile accidents combined. Rape is vastly underreported in the United States. Because many of these attacks occurring daily go un-reported and unrecognized, sexual assault is oftenconsidered a silent-violent epidemic. In the UnitedStates, 1 in 5 women and 1 in 71 men report havingbeen raped at some time in their lives (CDC, 2012b). An increase in the incidence of child abuse and re- lated fatalities has also been documented. In 2011, anestimated 3.7 million cases of possible child abuse orneglect were reported to child protective services, andabout one-fifth of these cases were substantiated (U.S.Department of Health and Human Services [USD-HHS], 2012). An estimated 1,545 children died fromcauses related to abuse or neglect in 2011. Abuse affects all populations equally. It occurs among all races, religions, economic classes, ages, andeducational backgrounds. The phenomenon is cycli-cal in that many abusers were themselves victims ofabuse as children. Family violence is not a new problem; in fact, it is probably as old as humankind, and has been docu-mented as far back as biblical times. Child abuse be-came a mandatory reportable occurrence in the UnitedStates in 1968. Responsibility for the protection of eld-ers from abuse rests primarily with the states. In 1987,Congress passed amendments to the Older AmericansAct of 1965 that provide for state Area Agencies onAging to assess the need for elder abuse preventionservices. These events have made it possible for individ-uals who once felt powerless to stop the abuse againstthem, to come forward and seek advice, support, andprotection. Aside from the individual physical, psychological, and social devastation that violence incurs, there are eco-nomic implications as well. The annual cost of intimatepartner violence, measured in terms of medical care andlost productivity, is close to $6 billion (CDC, 2013). This chapter discusses intimate partner violence, child abuse (including neglect), and sexual assault.Elder abuse is discussed in Chapter 34. Factors thatpredispose individuals to commit acts of abuse againstothers, as well as the physical and psychological effects on the survivors, are examined. Nursing of individuals who have experienced abu- sive behavior from others is presented within the con-text of the nursing process. Various treatmentmodalities are described. Predisposing Factors What predisposes individuals to be abusive? Althoughno one really knows for sure, several theories havebeen espoused. A brief discussion of ideas associatedwith biological, psychological, and sociocultural viewsis presented here. Biological Theories Neurophysiological Influences Various components of the neurological system inboth humans and animals have been implicated inboth the facilitation and inhibition of aggressive im-pulses. Areas of the brain that may be involved in-clude the temporal lobe, the limbic system, and theamygdaloid nucleus (Tardiff, 2003). Biochemical Influences Studies show that various neurotransmitters\u2014in par-ticular norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin\u2014may play a role in the facilitation and inhibition ofaggressive impulses (Hollander, Berlin, & Stein,2008). This theory is consistent with the \"fight orflight\" arousal described by Selye (1956) in his theoryof the response to stress (see Chapter 1). An explana-tion of these biochemical influences on violent behav-ior is presented in Figure 35-1. Genetic Influences Various genetic components related to aggressive behav-ior have been investigated. Some studies have linked increased aggressiveness with selective inbreeding inmice, suggesting the possibility of a direct genetic link.Another genetic characteristic that was once thought tohave some implication for aggressive behavior was thegenetic karyotype XYY. The XYY syndrome has beenfound to contribute to aggressive behavior in a smallpercentage of cases (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). The evi-dence linking this chromosomal aberration to aggressiveand deviant behavior has not been firmly established. Disorders of the Brain Organic brain syndromes associated with various cere-bral disorders have been implicated in the predispo-sition to aggressive and violent behavior (Cummings& Mega, 2003; Sadock & Sadock, 2007; Tardiff, 2003).Brain tumors, particularly in the areas of the limbicsystem and the temporal lobes; trauma to the brain,resulting in cerebral changes; and diseases, such asencephalitis (or medications that may effect this 778 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations CORE CONCEPT Abuse The maltreatment of one person by another. 4092_Ch35_777-797 24/07/14 5:36 PM Page 778syndrome) and epilepsy, particularly temporal lobe epilepsy, have all been implicated. Psychological Theories Psychodynamic Theory The psychodynamic theorists imply that unmet needsfor satisfaction and security result in an underdevelopedego and a weak superego. It is thought that when frus-tration occurs, aggression and violence supply this indi-vidual with a dose of power and prestige that boosts theself-image and validates a significance to his or her lifethat is lacking. The immature ego cannot prevent dom-inant id behaviors from occurring, and the weak super-ego is unable to produce feelings of guilt.CHAPTER 35 Survivors of Abuse or Neglect of NEUROTRANSMITTERS Neurotransmitters that have been implicated in the etiology of aggression and violence include decreases in serotonin and incre ases in norepinephrine and dopamine (Hollander et al., 2008; Tardiff, 2003). ASSOCIATED AREAS OF THE BRAIN \u0081 Emotional alterations nervous system in \"fight-or-flight\" response\u0081 Hippocampus: Learning and memory MEDICATIONS USED TO MODULATE AGGRESSION 1. Studies have suggested that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may reduce irritability and aggression consistent with the hypothesis of reduced serotonergic activity in aggression. 2. Mood stabilizers that dampen limbic irritability may be important in reducing the susceptibility to react to provocation or threatening stimuli by overactivation of limbic system structures such (Depakote) have yielded positive results. Lithium has also been used effectively inviolent individuals (Schatzberg, Cole, & DeBattista, 2010). 3. Anti-adrenergic agents such as beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol) have been shown to reduce aggression in some individuals, presumably by dampening excessive noradrenergic activity (Schatzberg et al., 2010). 4. In their ability to modulate excessive dopaminergic activity, antipsychotics\u2014both typical and atypical\u2014have been helpful in t he control of aggression and violence, particularly in individuals with co-morbid psychosis.4092_Ch35_777-797 24/07/14 5:36 PM Page 779Learning Theory Children learn to behave by imitating their role models, which are usually their parents. Models are more likelyto be imitated when they are perceived as prestigious orinfluential, or when the behavior is followed by positivereinforcement. Children may have an idealistic percep-tion of their parents during the very early developmen-tal stages but, as they mature, may begin to imitate thebehavior patterns of their teachers, friends, and others.Individuals who were abused as children or who wit-nessed domestic violence as a child are more likely tobehave in an abusive manner as adults (Hornor, 2005). Adults and children alike model many of their behaviors after individuals they observe on televi-sion and in movies. Unfortunately, modeling can re-sult in maladaptive as well as adaptive behavior,particularly when children view heroes triumphingover villains by using violence. It is also possible thatindividuals who have a biological predisposition to-ward aggressive behavior may be more susceptibleto negative role modeling. Sociocultural Theories Societal Influences Although they agree that perhaps some biologicaland psychological aspects are influential, social scien-tists believe that aggressive behavior is primarily aproduct of one's culture and social structure. American society essentially was founded on a gen- eral acceptance of violence as a means of solvingproblems. The concept of relative deprivation hasbeen shown to have a profound effect on collectiveviolence within a society. Kennedy and associates(1998) have stated: Studies have shown that poverty and income are pow- erful predictors of homicide and violent crime. Theeffect of the growing gap between the rich and pooris mediated through an undermining of social cohe-sion, or social capital, and decreased social capital isin turn associated with increased firearm homicideand violent crime. (p. 7) Indeed, the United States was populated by the vi- olent actions of one group of people over another. Since that time, much has been said and written, andlaws have been passed, regarding the civil rights of allpeople. However, to this day many people wouldagree that the statement \"All men are created equal\"is hypocritical in our society. Societal influences may contribute to violence when individuals realize that their needs and desiresare not being met relative to other people (Tardiff,2003). When poor and oppressed people find thatthey have limited access through legitimate channels,they are more likely to resort to delinquent behaviorsin an effort to obtain desired ends. This lack of opportunity and subsequent delinquency may evencontribute to a subculture of violence within a society. Application of the Nursing Process Background Assessment Data Data related to intimate partner violence, child abuseand neglect, and sexual assault are presented in this sec-tion. Characteristics of both victim and abuser are ad-dressed. This information may be used as backgroundknowledge in designing plans of care for these clients. Intimate Partner Violence780 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations CORE CONCEPT Battering A pattern of coercive control founded on and supported by physical and/or sexual violence or threat of violenceof an intimate partner. The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (2013) states: Battering is a pattern of behavior used to establish power and control over another person with whom anintimate relationship is or has been shared throughfear and intimidation, often including the threat oruse of violence. Battering happens when one personbelieves that they are entitled to control another. The U.S. Department of Justice (2012) defines intimate partner violence as: A pattern of abusive behavior that is used by an inti-mate partner to gain or maintain power and controlover the other intimate partner. [Intimate partner]violence can be physical, sexual, emotional, eco-nomic, or psychological actions or threats of actionsthat influence another person. This includes any be-haviors that intimidate, manipulate, humiliate, iso-late, frighten, terrorize, coerce, threaten, blame,hurt, injure, or wound someone. Physical abuse between domestic partners may be known as spouse abuse, domestic or family violence, wife or husband battering, or intimate partner vio-lence (IPV). Data from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Sta-tistics (2012) reflect the following: (1) 82 percent ofvictims of intimate violence were women, (2) womenages 25 to 34 experienced the highest per capita ratesof intimate violence, and (3) intimate partners com-mitted 2 percent of the nonfatal violence againstmen. Many of the victimizations are not reported tothe police, and the main reason given for not report-ing is that it was \"considered a personal matter.\" Profile of the Victim Battered women represent all age, racial, religious,cultural, educational, and socioeconomic groups.4092_Ch35_777-797 24/07/14 5:36 PM Page 780They may be married or single, housewives or busi- ness executives. Many women who are battered havelow self-esteem, commonly adhere to feminine sex-role stereotypes, and often accept the blame for thebatterer's actions. Feelings of guilt, anger, fear, andshame are common. They may be isolated from fam-ily and support systems. Some women who are in violent relationships grew up in abusive homes and may have left those homes,even gotten married, at a very young age in order toescape the abuse. The battered woman views her rela-tionship as male dominant, and as the battering con-tinues, her ability to see the options available to herand to make decisions concerning her life (and possi-bly those of her children) decreases. The phenome-non of learned helplessness may be applied to the woman's progressing inability to act on her own behalf.Learned helplessness occurs when an individual comesto understand that regardless of his or her behavior,the outcome is unpredictable and usually undesirable. Profile of the Victimizer Men who batter usually are characterized as persons withlow self-esteem. Pathologically jealous, they present a\"dual personality,\" one to the partner and one to the restof the world (Meskill & Conner, 2010). They are oftenunder a great deal of stress, but have limited ability tocope with the stress. The typical abuser is very possessiveand perceives his spouse as a possession. He becomesthreatened when she shows any sign of independence orattempts to share herself and her time with others. Smallchildren are often ignored by the abuser; however, theymay also become the targets of abuse as they grow older,particularly if they attempt to protect their mother fromabuse. The abuser also may use threats of taking the chil-dren away as a tactic of emotional abuse. The abusing man typically wages a continuous campaign of degradation against his female partner.He insults and humiliates her and everything shedoes at every opportunity. He strives to keep her iso-lated from others and totally dependent on him. Hedemands to know where she is at every moment, andwhen she tells him he challenges her honesty. Heachieves power and control through intimidation. The Cycle of Battering In her classic studies of battered women and their re-lationships, Walker (1979) identified a cycle of pre-dictable behaviors that are repeated over time. Thebehaviors can be divided into three distinct phases thatvary in time and intensity both within the same rela-tionship and among different couples. Figure 35-2 de-picts a graphic representation of the cycle of battering. Phase I: The Tension-Building Phase During this phase, the woman senses that the man's tolerance for frus- tration is declining. He becomes angr y with littleprovocation but, after lashing out at her, may be quickto apologize. The woman may become very nurturingand compliant, anticipating his every whim in an ef-fort to prevent his anger from escalating. She may justtry to stay out of his way. Minor battering incidents may occur during this phase, and in a desperate effort to avoid more seriousconfrontations, the woman accepts the abuse as legit-imately directed toward her. She denies her angerand rationalizes his behavior (e.g., \"I need to do bet-ter\"; \"He's under so much stress at work\"; \"It's the al-cohol. If only he didn't drink\"). She assumes the guiltfor the abuse, even reasoning that perhaps she didde- serve the abuse, just as her aggressor suggests. The minor battering incidents continue, and the tension mounts as the woman waits for the impend-ing explosion. The abuser begins to fear that hispartner will leave him. His jealousy and possessive-ness increase, and he uses threats and brutality tokeep her in his captivity. Battering incidents be-come more intense, after which the woman be-comes less and less psychologically capable ofrestoring equilibrium. She withdraws from him,which he misinterprets as rejection, further escalat-ing his anger toward her. Phase I may last from a fewweeks to many months or even years. Phase II: The Acute Battering Incident This phase is the most violent and the shortest, usually lasting up to 24 hours. It most often begins with the batterer justifyinghis behavior to himself. By the end of the incident,however , he cannot understand what has happened, only that in his rage he has lost control over his behavior. This incident may begin with the batterer wanting to \"just teach her a lesson.\" In some instances, thewoman may intentionally provoke the behavior. Havingcome to a point in phase I in which the tension is CHAPTER 35 Survivors of Abuse or Neglect 781 Cycle of BatteringPhase I. Tension-Building Phase Phase III. Honeymoon Phase Phase II. Acute Battering Incident Triggering Event Occurs FIGURE 35-2 The cycle of battering.4092_Ch35_777-797 24/07/14 5:36 PM Page 781unbearable, long-term battered women know that once the acute phase is behind them, things will be better. During phase II, women feel their only option is to find a safe place to hide from the batterer. Thebeating is severe, and many women can describe theviolence in great detail, almost as if dissociationfrom their bodies had occurred. The batterer gen-erally minimizes the severity of the abuse. Help is usually sought only in the event of severe injuryor if the woman fears for her life or those of herchildren. Phase III: Calm, Loving, Respite (\"Honeymoon\") Phase In this phase, the batterer becomes extremely loving,kind, and contrite. He promises that the abuse willnever recur and begs her forgiveness. He is afraid shewill leave him and uses every bit of charm he canmuster to ensure this does not happen. He believeshe now can control his behavior , and because now that he has \"taught her a lesson,\" he believes she willnot \"act up\" again. He plays on her feelings of guilt, and she desper- ately wants to believe him. She wants to believe thathe canchange, and that she will no longer have to suf- fer abuse. During this phase the woman relives heroriginal dream of ideal love and chooses to believethat thisis what her partner is really like. This loving phase becomes the focus of the woman's perception of the relationship. She bases herreason for remaining in the relationship on this \"mag-ical\" ideal phase and hopes against hope that the pre-vious phases will not be repeated. This hope is evidenteven in those women who have lived through a num-ber of horrendous cycles. Although phase III usually lasts somewhere be- tween the lengths of time associated with phases I andII, it can be so short as to almost pass undetected. Inmost instances, the cycle soon begins again with re-newed tensions and minor battering incidents. In aneffort to \"steal\" a few precious moments of the phaseIII kind of loving, the battered woman becomes a col-laborator in her own abusive lifestyle. Victim and bat-terer become locked together in an intense, symbioticrelationship. Why Does She Stay? Probably the most common response that batteredwomen give for staying is that they fear for their lifeand/or the lives of their children. As the batteringprogresses, the man gains power and control throughintimidation and instilling fear with threats such as,\"I'll kill you and the kids if you try to leave.\" Chal-lenged by these threats, and compounded by her lowself-esteem and sense of powerlessness, the womansees no way out. In fact, she may try to leave only toreturn when confronted by her partner and the psy-chological power he holds over her. Women have been known to stay in an abusive re- lationship for many reasons, some of which includethe following (Crisis Intervention Center, 2013;Meskill & Conner, 2010; Mouradian, 2004): Fear of retaliation: Her partner may have told her that if she leaves he will find her and kill her andthe children. For the children: She may fear losing custody of the children if she leaves. For financial reasons: She may have no financial resources, access to the resources, or job skills. Lack of a support network: She may be under pres- sure from family members to stay in the marriageand try to work things out. Religious reasons: She may have religious convic- tions against divorce, believing that she must savethe marriage at all costs. Hopefulness: She remembers good times and love in the relationship and has hope that her partnerwill change his behavior and they can have goodtimes again. Child Abuse Erik Erikson (1963) stated, \"The worst sin is the mutilation of a child's spirit.\" Children are vulnera-ble and relatively powerless, and the effects of mal-treatment are infinitely deep and long lasting. Childmaltreatment typically includes physical or emo-tional injury, physical or emotional neglect, or sexual acts inflicted upon a child by a caregiver. The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act(CAPTA), as amended and reauthorized in 2003,identifies a minimum set of acts or behaviors that characterize maltreatment (Child Welfare Information Gateway [CWIG], 2013). States mayuse these as foundations on which to establish statelegislation. Physical Abuse Physical abuse of a child includes \"any nonaccidentalphysical injury (ranging from minor bruises to severefractures or death) as a result of punching, beating,kicking, biting, shaking, throwing, stabbing, choking,hitting (with a hand, stick, strap, or other object),burning, or any other method that is inflicted by aparent, caregiver, or other person who has responsi-bility for the child\" (American Psychiatric Association[APA], 2013, p. 717). Maltreatment is consideredwhether or not the caretaker intended to cause harm,or even if the injury resulted from over-discipline orphysical punishment. The most obvious way to detectit is by outward physical signs. However, behavioral in-dicators also may be evident. Signs of Physical Abuse Indicators of physical abuse may include any of the following (CWIG, 2013). The child: Has unexplained burns, bites, bruises, broken bones, or black eyes. Has fading bruises or other marks noticeable afteran absence from school.782 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch35_777-797 24/07/14 5:36 PM Page 782Seems frightened of the parents and protests or cries when it is time to go home. Shrinks at the approach of adults. Reports injury by a parent or another adult caregiver. Abuses animals or pets. Physical abuse may be suspected when the parent or other adult caregiver (CWIG, 2013): Offers conflicting, unconvincing, or no explana-tion for the child's injury. Describes the child as \"evil,\" or in some other verynegative way. Uses harsh physical discipline with the child. Has a history of abuse as a child. Has a history of abusing animals or pets. Emotional Abuse Emotional abuse involves a pattern of behavior on the part of the parent or caretaker that resultsin serious impairment of the child's social, emo-tional, or intellectual functioning. Examples ofemotional injury include belittling or rejecting thechild, ignoring the child, blaming the child forthings over which he or she has no control, isolatingthe child from normal social experiences, and usingharsh and inconsistent discipline. Behavioral indi-cators of emotional injury may include (CWIG,2013): Shows extremes in behavior, such as overly compli-ant or demanding behavior, extreme passivity, oraggressionIs either inappropriately adult (e.g., parentingother children) or inappropriately infantile (e.g.,frequently rocking or head-banging) Is delayed in physical or emotional development Has attempted suicide Reports a lack of attachment to the parent Emotional abuse may be suspected when the par- ent or other adult caregiver (CWIG, 2013): Constantly blames, belittles, or berates the child. Is unconcerned about the child and refuses toconsider offers of help for the child's problems. Overtly rejects the child. Physical and Emotional Neglect Indicators of Neglect The possibility of neglect may be considered when the child (CWIG, 2013): Is frequently absent from school. Begs or steals food or money.CHAPTER 35 Survivors of Abuse or Neglect 783 IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE Sachs, B., Hall, L.A., Lutenbacher, M., and Rayens, M.K. (1999). Potential for abusive parenting by rural moth-ers with low-birth-weight children. Image: Journal ofNursing Scholarship, 31(1), 21-25. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to describe factors influencing the potential for abusive par- enting by rural mothers of low-birth-weight (LBW) children.The convenience sample in this study included 48 mothersof LBW children, ranging in age from 18 to 39 years, all liv-ing in a rural area of the state, and all living with their LBWinfant at the time of the study. Average length of the chil-dren's hospitalization after birth was 6 weeks, and the av-erage age at time of the study was 9 months. In-homeinterviews were conducted using structured questionnairesto assess the mothers' everyday stressors, depressivesymptoms, functional social support, quality of family rela-tionships, and child abuse potential. RESULTS OF THE STUDY: According to the questionnaires used for measurement, 54 percent of the mothers indi- cated a high level of depressive symptoms and 63 percentindicated a high potential for physical child abuse. No sig-nificant differences were noted in depressive symptomsand potential for child abuse by birth weight, health statusof the child, or time since hospital discharge. Mothers withhigh child abuse potential reported more everyday stressorsand depressive symptoms, less functional social support,and poorer family functioning. Because in this study every-day stressors and the two social support systems (func-tional social support and quality of family relationships)were examined as predictors of depressive symptoms, it issuggested that everyday stressors exert both a direct andan indirect effect on mothers' potential for child abuse. Thestrongest predictor of child abuse potential was mothers'depressive symptoms. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The researchers con- clude that rural mothers of LBW children are at risk for abusive parenting. This study demonstrated the adverse effects ofeveryday stressors, minimal social resources, and depressivesymptoms on mothers' potential for abusive parenting. Nursesshould provide attention to the mental health of mothers livingin isolated, rural areas. Information should be made availableto these mothers regarding community resources that offersocial support and child-care assistance. Nurses could estab-lish and conduct educational programs to improve parentingskills and promote more positive child health outcomes.CORE CONCEPT Neglect Physical neglect of a child includes refusal of or delay in seeking health care, abandonment, expulsion fromthe home or refusal to allow a runaway to returnhome, and inadequate supervision.Emotional neglect refers to a chronic failure by the par- ent or caretaker to provide the child with the hope, love,and support necessary for the development of a sound,healthy personality. 4092_Ch35_777-797 24/07/14 5:36 PM Page 783Lacks needed medical or dental care, immuniza- tions, or glasses. Is consistently dirty and has severe body odor. Lacks sufficient clothing for the weather. Abuses alcohol or other drugs. States that there is no one at home to provide care. The possibility of neglect may be considered when the parent or other adult caregiver (CWIG, 2013): Appears to be indifferent to the child. Seems apathetic or depressed. Behaves irrationally or in a bizarre manner. Is abusing alcohol or other drugs. Sexual Abuse of a Child Various definitions of child sexual abuse are available in the literature. CAPTA defines sexual abuse as: Employment, use, persuasion, inducement, entice- ment, or coercion of any child to engage in, or as-sist any other person to engage in, any sexuallyexplicit conduct or simulation of such conduct forthe purpose of producing any visual depiction ofsuch conduct; or the rape, and in cases of caretakeror inter-familial relationships, statutory rape, mo-lestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual ex-ploitation of children, or incest with children.(CWIG, 2013) Included in the definition is sexual exploitation of a child , in which a child is induced or coerced into engaging in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of promoting any performance, and childsexual abuse, in which a child is being used for thesexual pleasure of an adult (parent or caretaker) orany other person.Becomes pregnant or contracts a venereal disease,particularly if under age 14. Runs away. Reports sexual abuse by a parent or another adultcaregiver. Sexual abuse may be considered a possibility when the parent or other adult caregiver (CWIG, 2013): Is unduly protective of the child or severely limitsthe child's contact with other children, especiallyof the opposite sex. Is secretive and isolated. Is jealous or controlling with family members. Characteristics of the Abuser A number of factors have been associated with adultswho abuse or neglect their children. Sadock & Sadock(2007) report that 90 percent of parents who abusetheir children were severely physically abused by theirown mothers or fathers. Murray, Zentner, and Yakimo(2009) identify the following as additional character-istics that may be associated with abusive parents: Experiencing a stressful life situation (e.g., unem-ployment; poverty) Having few, if any, support systems; commonly iso-lated from others Lacking understanding of child development orcare needs Lacking adaptive coping strategies; angers easily;has difficulty trusting others Expecting the child to be perfect; may exaggerate anymild difference the child manifests from the \"usual\" Flaherty and Stirling (2010) identify a number of factors that place a child at risk for maltreatment.They cite certain characteristics of the child, the par-ent, and the environment. These characteristics arepresented in Box 35-1. When multiple factors coexist,the risk of child abuse increases. The Incestuous Relationship A great deal of attention has been given to the studyof father-daughter incest. In these cases there is usu-ally an impaired sexual relationship between the parents. Communication between the parents is inef-fective, which prevents them from correcting theirproblems. Typically, the father is domineering, impul-sive, and physically abusing; whereas the mother ispassive and submissive, and denigrates her role as wifeand mother. She is often aware of, or at least stronglysuspects, the incestuous behavior between the fatherand daughter but may believe in or fear her hus-band's absolute authority over the family. She maydeny that her daughter is being harmed and may actually be grateful that her husband's sexual de-mands are being met by someone other than herself. Onset of the incestuous relationship typically oc- curs when the daughter is 8 to 10 years of age and784 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations CORE CONCEPT Incest The occurrence of sexual contacts or interaction be- tween, or sexual exploitation of, close relatives, or be-tween participants who are related to each other by akinship bond that is regarded as a prohibition to sexualrelations (e.g., caretakers, stepparents, stepsiblings)(Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Indicators of Sexual Abuse Child abuse may be consid- ered a possibility when the child (CWIG, 2013): Has difficulty walking or sitting. Suddenly refuses to change for gym or to partici- pate in physical activities. Reports nightmares or bedwetting. Experiences a sudden change in appetite. Demonstrates bizarre, sophisticated, or unusualsexual knowledge or behavior.4092_Ch35_777-797 24/07/14 5:36 PM Page 784commonly begins with genital touching and fondling. In the beginning, the child may accept the sexual ad-vances from her father as signs of affection. As the in-cestuous behavior continues and progresses, thedaughter usually becomes more bewildered, confused,and frightened, never knowing whether her father willbe paternal or sexual in his interactions with her. The relationship may become a love-hate situation on the part of the daughter. She continues to strivefor the ideal father-daughter relationship but is fear-ful and hateful of the sexual demands he places onher. The mother may be alternately caring and com-petitive as she witnesses her husband's possessivenessand affections directed toward her daughter. Out offear that his daughter may expose their relationship,the father may attempt to interfere with her normalpeer relationships (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). It has been suggested that some fathers who partic- ipate in incestuous relationships may have unconscioushomosexual tendencies and have difficulty achievinga stable heterosexual orientation. On the other hand,some men have frequent sex with their wives and sev-eral of their own children but are unwilling to seek sex-ual partners outside the nuclear family because of aneed to maintain the public facade of a stable and com-petent patriarch. Although the oldest daughter in afamily is most vulnerable to becoming a participant infather-daughter incest, some fathers form sequentialrelationships with several daughters. If incest has beenreported with one daughter, it should be suspectedwith all of the other daughters (Murray et al., 2009). The Adult Survivor of Incest Several common characteristics have been identifiedin adults who have experienced incest as children.Basic to these characteristics is a fundamental lack oftrust resulting from an unsatisfactory parent-child re-lationship, which causes low self-esteem and a poorsense of identity. Children of incest often feeltrapped, for they have been admonished not to talkabout the experience and may be afraid, or even fearfor their lives, if they are exposed. If they do musterthe courage to report the incest, particularly to themother, they sometimes are not believed. This is con-fusing to the child, who is then left with a sense of self-doubt and the inability to trust his or her ownfeelings. The child develops feelings of guilt with therealization over the years that the parents are usinghim or her in an attempt to solve their own problems. Childhood sexual abuse commonly distorts the de- velopment of a normal association of pleasure withsexual activity (Reeves, 2003). Peer relationships areoften delayed, altered, inhibited, or perverted. Insome instances, individuals who were sexually abusedas children completely retreat from sexual activityand avoid all close interpersonal relationshipsthroughout life. Other adult manifestations of child-hood sexual abuse in women include diminished libido, pain/penetration disorder, nymphomania,and promiscuity. In male survivors of childhood sex-ual abuse, erectile disorder, premature ejaculation,exhibitionistic disorder, and compulsive sexual con-quests may occur. Ler ner (2005) suggested that adult survivors of incest are at risk for experiencing symp-toms of posttraumatic stress disorder, sexual dysfunc-tion, somatic symptom disorders, compulsive sexualbehaviors, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, sub-stance disorders, and intolerance of or constantsearch for intimacy. The conflicts associated with pain (either physical or emotional) and sexual pleasure experienced by chil-dren who are sexually abused are commonly mani-fested symbolically in adult relationships. Women whowere abused as children commonly enter into relation-ships with men who abuse them physically, sexually, oremotionally (Bensley, VanEenwyk, & Wynkoop, 2003). Adult survivors of incest who decide to come for- ward with their stories usually are estranged from nu-clear family members. They are blamed by familyCHAPTER 35 Survivors of Abuse or Neglect 785 BOX 35-1 Factors and Characteristics That Place a Child at Risk for Maltreatment oung maternal or paternal age Abused as a childDepression or other mental illnessPoor knowledge of child developmentor unrealistic expectations of the childNegative perception of normal child behaviorENVIRONMENT (COMMUNITY AND S OCIETY) Social isolation Pover ty UnemploymentLow educational achievementSingle-parent homeNon-biologically related male living in the homeFamily or intimate partner violence SOURCE: Flaherty, E.G., & Stirling, J., et al.

Frequently theestrangement becomes permanent when family mem-bers continue to deny the behavior and the individualis accused of lying. In recent years, a number ofcelebrities have come forward with stories of theirchildhood sexual abuse. Some have chosen to makethe disclosure only after the death of their parents.Revelation of these past activities can be one way ofcontributing to the healing process for which incestsurvivors so desperately strive. Sexual Assaultof consent varies from state to state, ranging from age14 to 18 (King, 2012). An adult who has intercoursewith a person who is under the age of consent can bearrested for statutory rape, although the interactionmay have occurred between consenting individuals. Profile of the Victimizer Older profiles of the individual who rapes were de-scribed by Abrahamsen (1960) and Macdonald(1971), who identified the rapist's childhood as\"mother-dominated\" and the mother as \"seductivebut rejecting.\" The behavior of the mother toward theson was described as overbearing, with seductive un-dertones. Mother and son shared little secrets, andshe rescued him when his delinquent acts createdproblems with others. However, she was quick to with-draw her love and attention when he went against herwishes, a rejection that was powerful and unyielding.She was domineering and possessive of the son, adominance that often continued into his adult life.Macdonald (1971) stated: The seductive mother arouses overwhelming anxiety in her son with great anger, which may be expresseddirectly toward her but more often is displaced ontoother women. When this seductive behavior is com-bined with parental encouragement of assaultive be-havior, the setting is provided for personalitydevelopment in the child which may result in sadistic,homicidal sexual attacks on women in adolescenceor adult life. Many rapists report growing up in abusive homes (McCormack, 2002). Even when the parental brutal- ity is discharged by the father, the anger may be di-rected toward the mother who did not protect herchild from physical assault. More recent feminist the-ories suggest that the rapist displaces this anger onthe rape victim because he cannot directly express ittoward other men (Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Anotherfeminist view suggests that rape is most common insocieties that encourage aggressiveness in males, thathave distinct gender roles, and in which men regardwomen's roles as inferior (King, 2012). Statistics show that the greatest number of rapists are between the ages of 25 and 44. Of rapists, 54 per-cent are white, 32 percent are African-American, andthe remainder are of other races, mixed race, or ofunknown race (U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics,2011). Many are either married or cohabiting at the time of their offenses. For those with previous criminal activity, the majority of their convictions arefor crimes against property rather than against people.Most rapists do not have histories of mental illness. The Victim Rape can occur at any age; however, the most recentstatistics suggest that the highest-risk age group is 16to 34 years (U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2011).786 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations CORE CONCEPT Rape The expression of power and dominance by means of sexual violence, most commonly by men over women,although men may also be rape victims. Sexual assault is viewed as any type of sexual act in which an individual is threatened or coerced, orforced to submit against his or her will. Rape, a typeof sexual assault, occurs over a broad spectrum of ex-periences ranging from the surprise attack by astranger to insistence on sexual intercourse by an ac-quaintance or spouse. Regardless of the definingsource, one common theme always emerges: Rape isan act of aggression, not one of passion. Acquaintance rape (called date rape if the en- counter is a social engagement agreed to by the victim)is a term applied to situations in which the rapist is ac-quainted with the victim. They may be out on a firstdate, may have been dating for a number of months,or merely may be acquaintances or schoolmates. Col-lege campuses are the location for a staggering num-ber of these types of rapes, a great many of which gounreported. An increasing number of colleges and uni-versities are establishing programs for rape preventionand counseling for survivors of rape. Marital rape, which has been recognized only in re- cent years as a legal category, is the case in which aspouse may be held liable for sexual abuse directed ata marital partner against that person's will. Histori-cally, with societal acceptance of the concept ofwomen as marital property, the legal definition of rapeheld an exemption within the marriage relationship.In 1993, marital rape became a crime in all 50 states,under at least one section of the sexual offenses code.In 17 states and the District of Columbia, there are noexemptions from rape prosecution granted to hus-bands. However, in 33 states, there are still some ex-emptions given to husbands from rape prosecution. Statutory rape is defined as unlawful intercourse be- tween a person who is over the age of consent and aperson who is under the age of consent. The legal age4092_Ch35_777-797 24/07/14 5:36 PM Page 786Most sexual assault victims are single women, and the attack frequently occurs in or close to the victim's ownneighborhood. Scully (1994), in a study of a prison sample of rapists, found that in \"stranger rapes,\" victims were not chosenfor any reason having to do with appearance or behav-ior, but simply because the individual happened to bein a certain place at a certain time. Scully stated: The most striking and consistent factor in all the stranger rapes, whether committed by a lone assailantor a group, is the unfortunate fact that the victim was\"just there\" in a location unlikely to draw the atten-tion of a passerby. Almost every one of these men saidexactly the same thing, \"It could have been anywoman,\" and a few added that because it was dark,they could not even see what their victim looked likevery well. (p. 175) In her study, Scully found that 62 percent of the rapists used a weapon, most frequently a knife. Most suggested that they used the weapon to terrorize andsubdue the victim but not to inflict serious injury. Thepresence of a weapon (real or perceived) appears tobe the principal measure of the degree to which awoman resists her attacker. Rape survivors who present themselves for care shortly after the crime has occurred likely may be expe-riencing an overwhelming sense of violation and helpless- ness that began with the powerlessness and intimidationexperienced during the rape. Burgess (2010) identifiedtwo emotional patterns of response that may occurwithin hours after a rape and with which health-careworkers may be confronted in the emergency depart-ment or rape crisis center. In the expressed response pattern , the survivor expresses feelings of fear, anger, and anxiety through such behaviors as crying, sobbing,restlessness, and tension. In the controlled response pat-tern, the feelings are masked or hidden, and a calm, composed, or subdued affect is seen. The following manifestations may be evident in the days and weeks after the attack (Burgess, 2010): Contusions and abrasions about various parts ofthe body Headaches, fatigue, sleep pattern disturbances Stomach pains, nausea and vomiting Vaginal discharge and itching, burning upon uri-nation, rectal bleeding and pain Rage, humiliation, embarrassment, desire for re-venge, and self-blame Fear of physical violence and death The long-term effects of sexual assault depend largely on the individual's ego strength, social supportsystem, and the way he or she was treated as a victim(Burgess, 2010). Various long-term effects include in-creased restlessness, dreams and nightmares, andphobias (particularly those having to do with sexualinteraction). Some women report that it takes yearsto get over the experience; they describe a sense ofvulnerability and a loss of control over their own livesduring this period. They feel defiled and unable towash themselves clean, and some women are unableto remain living alone in their home or apartment. Some survivors develop a compounded rape reac- tion, in which additional symptoms such as depres-sion and suicide, substance abuse, and even psychoticbehaviors may be noted (Burgess, 2010). Anothervariation has been called the silent rape reaction, in which the survivor tells no one about the assault. Anx-iety is suppressed and the emotional burden may be-come overwhelming. The unresolved sexual traumamay not be revealed until the woman is forced to faceanother sexual crisis in her life that reactivates thepreviously unresolved feelings. Diagnosis/Outcome Identification Nursing diagnoses are formulated from the data gath-ered during the assessment phase and with back-ground knowledge regarding predisposing factors tothe situation. Some common nursing diagnoses forsurvivors of abuse include: Rape-trauma syndrome related to sexual assault ev-idenced by verbalizations of the attack; bruises andlacerations over areas of body; severe anxiety. Powerlessness related to cycle of battering evi-denced by verbalizations of abuse; bruises and lac-erations over areas of body; fear for her safety andthat of her children; verbalizations of no way to getout of the relationship. Risk for delayed development related to abusivefamily situation. Outcome Criteria The following criteria may be used to measure out-comes in the care of abuse survivors: The client who has been sexually assaulted: Is no longer experiencing panic anxiety. Demonstrates a degree of trust in the primary nurse. Has received immediate attention to physical injuries. Has initiated behaviors consistent with the grief response. The client who has been physically battered: Has received immediate attention to physical injuries. Verbalizes assurance of his or her immediate safety. Discusses life situation with primary nurse. Can verbalize choices from which he or she may re-ceive assistance. The child who has been abused: Has received immediate attention to physical injuries. Demonstrates trust in primary nurse by discussingabuse through the use of play therapy. Is demonstrating a decrease in regressive behaviors.CHAPTER 35 Survivors of Abuse or Neglect 7874092_Ch35_777-797 24/07/14 5:36 PM Page 787Planning/Implementation Table 35-1 provides a plan of care for the client who is a survivor of abuse. Nursing diagnoses are pre-sented, along with outcome criteria, appropriate nurs-ing interventions, and rationales for each. Concept Care Mapping The concept map care plan is an innovative ap-proach to planning and organizing nursing care(see Chapter 9). It is a diagrammatic teaching andlearning strategy that allows visualization of interre-lationships between medical diagnoses, nursing diagnoses, assessment data, and treatments. An ex-ample of a concept map care plan for a client whois a survivor of abuse is presented in Figure 35-3. Evaluation Evaluation of nursing actions to assist survivors ofabuse must be considered on both a short- and a long-term basis. Short-term evaluation may be facilitated by gathering information using the following types of questions: Has the individual been reassured of his or hersafety?788 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations Table 35-1 | CARE PLAN FOR SURVIVORS OF ABUSE NURSING DIAGNOSIS: RAPE-TRAUMA SYNDROME RELATED TO: Sexual assault EVIDENCED BY: Verbalizations of the attack; bruises and lacerations over areas of body; severe anxiety OUTCOME CRITERIA NURSING INTERVENTIONS RATIONALE 1.It is important to communicate the following to the individual who hasbeen sexually assaulted: \u0081 Y ou are safe here. \u0081 I'm sorry that it happened. \u0081 I'm glad you survived.\u0081 It's not your fault. No one deserves to be treated this way. \u0081 You did the best that you could. 2.Explain every assessment procedurethat will be conducted and why it isbeing conducted. Ensure that datacollection is conducted in a caring,nonjudgmental manner . 3.Ensure that the client has adequateprivacy for all immediate post-crisis in-terventions. T ry to have as few people as possible providing the immediatecare or collecting immediate evidence. 4.Encourage the client to g ive an account of the assault. Listen, but do not probe. 5.Discuss with the client whom to callfor suppor t or assistance. Provide in- formation about referrals for aftercare.Short-Term Goal \u0081 Client's physical wounds will heal without complication. Long-Term Goal \u0081 Client will begin a healthy grief resolution, initiating the processof physical and psychologicalhealing (time to be individuallydetermined).1.The woman who has been sexu-ally assaulted fears for her life andmust be reassured of her safety . She may also be overwhelmedwith self-doubt and self-blame, andthese statements instill trust andvalidate self-wor may serve to decreasefear/anxiety and increase trust. 3.The post-trauma client is extremelyvulnerable.

Assess for nonverbal signsof abuse: age-inappropriatebehaviors. 2.Conduct an in-depth interview withthe parent or adult who accompaniesthe child. Consider: If the injury isbeing repor ted as an accident, is the explanation reasonable? Is the injuryconsistent with the explanation? Is the injury consistent with the child'sdevelopmental capabilities? 3.Use games or play therapy to gainchild's trust. Use these techniques toassist in describing his or her side ofthe story . 4.Determine whether the nature of theinjuries warrants reporting to authori- ties. Specific state statutes must enter into the decision of whether to repor t suspected child abuse. Individualstate statutes regarding what consti-tutes child abuse and neglect may befound at http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/state/1.An accurate and thorough physicalassessment is required to provideappropriate care for the client. 2.Fear of imprisonment or loss ofchild custody may place the abu-sive parent on the defensive. Dis-crepancies may be evident in thedescription of the incident, andlying to cover up involvement is acommon defense that may be de-tectable in an in-depth interview . 3.Establishing a trusting relationshipwith an abused child is extremelydifficult. He or she may not evenwant to be touched. T hese types of play activities can provide a non-threatening environment that mayenhance the child's attempt to dis-cuss these painful issues. 4.A repor t is commonly made if there is reason to suspect that achild has been injured as a resultof physical, mental, emotional, orsexual abuse. \"Reason to suspect\"exists when there is evidence of adiscrepancy or inconsistency in ex-plaining a child's injury . Most states require that the following individu-als repor t cases of suspected child abuse: all health-care workers, allmental health therapists, teachers,child-care providers, firefighters,emergency medical personnel, andlaw enforcement personnel.

Charles has always been jealous and gets very angry when Annette even talks to another man. He has hit her several times, hard enough to produce bruises, but never on her face, and she is able to hide the abuse from others. Tonight at a party, Annette danced with another man, and Charles became violent. He punched the man in the face and dragged Annette out to the parking lot. She yelled at him, \"This is it! We are through! I don't ever want to see you again!\" He started beating her around the face and upper body, and yelled, \"Y ou can't break up with me! I won't allow it! Y ou belong to me, and no one else!\" He left her lying in the parking lot. She felt powerless, and, in her despondency, opened her purse and swallowed half a bottle of acetaminophen. When she told her girlfriend, Dana, what had happened, Dana called 911, and Annette was taken to the hospital. She was treated for the overdose, and her wounds were cleaned and dressed. Following physical stability, she was transferred to the psychiatric unit. She tells the nurse, \"I can't live like this. He won't let me go! I don't know what to do!\" The nurse develops the following concept map care plan for Annette.

Is the individual free from problems with interper-sonal relationships? Has the individual considered the alternatives forchange in his or her personal life? Has a decision been made relative to the choicesavailable? Is he or she satisfied with the decision that has beenmade? Treatment Modalities Crisis Intervention The focus of the initial interview and follow-up with theclient who has been sexually assaulted is on the rapeincident alone. Problems identified but unassociatedwith the rape are not dealt with at this time. The goalof crisis intervention is to help survivors return to theirprevious lifestyle as quickly as possible. The client should be involved in the intervention from the beginning. This promotes a sense of com-petency, control, and decision making. Because anoverwhelming sense of powerlessness accompaniesthe rape experience, active involvement by the sur-vivor is both a validation of personal worth and thebeginning of the recovery process. Crisis interven-tion is time limited\u2014usually 6 to 8 weeks. If prob-lems resurface beyond this time, the individual isreferred for assistance from other agencies (e.g.,long-term psychotherapy from a psychiatrist or men-tal health clinic). During the crisis period, attention is given to cop- ing strategies for dealing with the symptoms com-mon to the post-trauma client. Initially theindividual undergoes a period of disorganizationduring which there is difficulty making decisions,extreme or irrational fears, and general mistrust.Observable manifestations may range from starkhysteria, to expression of anger and rage, to silenceand withdrawal. Guilt and feelings of responsibilityfor the rape, as well as numerous physical manifes-tations, are common. The crisis counselor will at-tempt to help the individual draw upon previoussuccessful coping strategies to regain control overhis or her life. If the client is a victim of domestic violence, the coun- selor ensures that various resources and options aremade known to the individual so that she may make apersonal decision regarding what she wishes to do withher life. Support groups provide a valuable forum forreducing isolation and learning new strategies for cop-ing with the aftermath of physical or sexual abuse. Par-ticularly for the survivor of rape, the peer support groupprovides a therapeutic forum for reducing the sense ofisolation she may feel in the aftermath of predictable so-cial and interpersonal responses to her experience.Sadock and Sadock (2007) state: Few women emerge from the assault completely un- scathed. The manifestations and the degree of damage de-pend on the violence of the attack itself, the vulnerabilityof the woman, and the support system available to her im-mediately after the attack. A rape victim fares best whenshe receives immediate support and can ventilate her fearand rage to loving family members, sympathetic physicians,and law enforcement officials. Knowing that she has so-cially acceptable means of recourse, such as the arrest andconviction of the rapist, can help a rape victim. (p. 884) The Safe House or Shelter Most major cities in the United States now have safe houses or shelters where women can go to be assured of protection for them and their children. These shel-ters provide a variety of services, and the women receiveemotional support from staff and each other. Most shel-ters provide individual and group counseling; help withbureaucratic institutions such as the police, legal rep-resentation, and social services; child care and chil-dren's programming; and aid for the woman in makingfuture plans, such as employment counseling and link-ages with housing authorities. The shelters are usually run by a combination of professional and volunteer staff, including nurses,psychologists, lawyers, and others. Women who them-selves have been previously abused are often amongthe volunteer staff members. Group work is an important part of the service of shel- ters. Women in residence range from those in the imme-diate crisis phase to those who have progressed througha variety of phases of the grief process. Those newermembers can learn a great deal from the women whohave successfully resolved similar problems. Length ofstay varies a great deal from individual to individual, de-pending on a number of factors, such as outside supportnetwork, financial situation, and personal resources. The shelter provides a haven of physical safety for the battered woman and promotes expression of theintense emotions she may be experiencing regardingher situation. A woman often exhibits depression, ex-treme fear, or even violent expressions of anger andrage. In the shelter, she learns that these feelings arenormal and that others have also experienced thesesame emotions in similar situations. She is allowed togrieve for what has been lost and for what was expectedbut not achieved. Help is provided in overcoming thetremendous guilt associated with self-blame. This is adifficult step for someone who has accepted responsi-bility for another's behavior over a long period. New arrivals at the shelter are given time to expe- rience the relief from the safety and security pro-vided. Making decisions is discouraged during theperiod of immediate crisis and disorganization. Oncethe woman's emotions have become more stable,planning for the future begins. Through information792 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch35_777-797 24/07/14 5:36 PM Page 792from staff and peers, she learns what resources are available to her within the community. Feedback isprovided, but the woman makes her own decisionabout \"where she wants to go from here.\" She is ac-cepted and supported in whatever she chooses to do. Family Therapy The focus of therapy with families who use violenceis to help them develop democratic ways of solvingproblems. Studies show that the more a family usesthe democratic means of conflict resolution, the lesslikely they are to engage in physical violence. Fami-lies need to learn to deal with problems in ways thatcan produce mutual benefits for all concerned,rather than engaging in power struggles among fam-ily members. Parents also need to learn more effective methods of disciplining children, aside from physical punishment.Time-out techniques and methods that emphasize theimportance of positive reinforcement for acceptable be-havior can be very effective. Family members m ust be committed to consistent use of this behavior modifi-cation technique for it to be successful. Teaching parents about expectations for various de- velopmental levels may alleviate some of the stress thataccompanies these changes. Knowing what to expectfrom individuals at various stages of development mayprovide needed anticipatory guidance to deal with thecrises commonly associated with these stages. Therapy sessions with all family members together may focus on problems with family communication.Members are encouraged to express honest feelingsin a manner that is nonthreatening to other familymembers. Active listening, assertiveness techniques,and respecting the rights of others are taught and en-couraged. Barriers to effective communication areidentified and resolved. Referrals to agencies that promote effective par- enting skills (e.g., parent effectiveness training) maybe made. Alternative agencies that may relieve thestress of parenting (e.g., \"Mom's Day Out\" programs,sitter-sharing organizations, and day-care institutions)also may be considered. Support groups for abusiveparents may also be helpful, and assistance in locatingor initiating such a group may be provided. Summary and Key Points Abuse is the maltreatment of one person by another. Intimate partner violence, child abuse, and sexualassault are widespread, and all populations areequally affected.CHAPTER 35 Survivors of Abuse or Neglect 793 IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE Humphreys, J. (2000). Spirituality and distress in shel- tered battered women. Image: Journal of NursingScholarship, 32(3), 273-278. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: T he purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between spiritual beliefs and psy- cholog ical distress in sheltered battered women. The conven- ience sample in this study included 50 women, ages rangingfrom 19 to 60, who had resided for at least 21 days in one of4 battered women's shelters in the San Francisco Bay Area. Eth-nicity included 20 African Americans, 11 European Americans,11 Latino Americans, 5 Asian Americans, 1 Native American,and 2 other (mixed or not given). All had been abused by ahusband or partner. Psychological distress was measuredusing the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90), a test thatis scored and interpreted for 9 primary symptom dimensions:somatization, obsessive-compulsiveness, interpersonal sensi-tivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoidideation, and psychoticism. Spirituality was measured usingthe Spiritual Perspectives Scale (SPS), a 10-item scale thatmeasures the extent to which one holds certain spiritual viewsand engages in spiritually related interactions. In the instruc-tions, spirituality is referred to as \"an awareness of one's innerself and a sense of connection to a higher being, nature, others, or to some purpose greater than oneself.\" RESULTS OF THE STUDY: The women in this study suffered sig- nificant psychological distress that was highly correlated withthe frequency and severity of battering they had experienced. However, participants who scored higher on the SPS experi-enced fewer and less intense symptoms in the obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility dimensionsof the SCL-90. Eighty percent of the participants indicated abelief in God or a \"higher power,\" and that their spirituality wasa significant part of their lives. Some indicated that theystrongly relied on their spiritual support for survival in theirstressful life situation. Eighty-two percent reported that theythought forgiveness was an important part of their spirituality. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The results of this study indicate that spirituality among battered women is a means of reducing psychological stress by a connection withpowers beyond oneself. The author cited research studies,which concluded that \"the role of nurses is not to solve thespiritual problems of clients but to provide an environmentwhere spirituality can be expressed.\" Suggested nursing inter-ventions include (1) spiritual assessment, (2) identification ofresources that have been a source of spiritual support, (3) offering compassionate presence and support, (4) openand honest communication, (5) listening, (6) fostering caringrelationships with significant other people in clients' lives, and(7) encouraging prayer and meditation. The author concludes,\"Encouraging battered women to consider personal resourcesthat have been helpful to them in the past, including their spir-itual beliefs, may provide benefit to these women who facetremendous demands with limited external resource.\"4092_Ch35_777-797 24/07/14 5:36 PM Page 793Various factors have been theorized as influential in the predisposition to violent behavior. Physiolog-ical and biochemical influences within the brainhave been suggested, as has the possibility of a di-rect genetic link. Organic brain syndromes associated with variouscerebral disorders have been implicated in the pre-disposition to aggressive and violent behavior. Psychoanalytical theorists relate the predispositionto violent behavior to underdeveloped ego and apoor self-concept. Learning theorists suggest that children imitatethe abusive behavior of their parents. This theoryhas been substantiated by studies that show thatindividuals who were abused as children orwhose parents disciplined them with physicalpunishment are more likely to be abusive asadults. Societal influences, such as general acceptance ofviolence as a means of solving problems, also havebeen implicated. Women who are battered often take blame fortheir situation. They may have been reared in abu-sive families and have come to expect this type ofbehavior. Battered women commonly see no way out of theirpresent situation and may be encouraged by theirsocial support network to remain in the abusive relationship.Child abuse includes physical and emotionalabuse, physical and emotional neglect, and sexualabuse of a child. A child may experience many years of abuse with-out reporting it because of fear of retaliation by theabuser. Some children report incest experiences to theirmothers, only to be rebuffed by her and told to remain secretive about the abuse. Adult survivors of incest often experience a num-ber of physical and emotional manifestations relat-ing back to the incestuous relationship. Sexual assault is identified as an act of aggression,not passion. Many rapists report growing up in abusive homes,and some theorists relate the predisposition torape to a \"seductive, but rejecting, mother.\" Rape is a traumatic experience, and many womenexperience flashbacks, nightmares, rage, physicalsymptoms, depression, and thoughts of suicide formany years after the occurrence. Treatment modalities for survivors of abuse includecrisis intervention with the sexual assault victim,safe shelter for battered women, and therapy forfamilies who use violence.794 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1. Sharon, a woman with multiple cuts and abrasions, arrives at the emergency department (ED) with her three small children. She tells the nurse her husband inflicted these wounds on her.

Lisa has just been admitted with her two small childrenafter she was treated in the emergency department. She had beenbeaten severely by her husband while he was intoxicated last night. She escaped with her children after he passed out in theirbedroom. In her initial assessment, Sandy learns from Lisa that she has been battered by her husband for 5 years, beginning shortly aftertheir marriage. She explained that she \"knew he drank quite a lotbefore we were married, but thought he would stop after we hadkids.\" Instead, the drinking has increased. Sometimes he doesn'teven get home from work until 11 o'clock or midnight, after stop-ping to drink at the bar with his buddies. Lately, he has begun to express jealousy and a lack of trust in Lisa, accusing her of numerous infidelities and indiscretions, noneof which is true. Lisa says, \"If only he wasn't under so much stresson his job, then maybe he wouldn't drink so much. Maybe if I triedharder to make everything perfect for him at home\u2014I don't know.What do you think I should do to keep him from acting this way?\" Answer the following questions related to Lisa: 1.What is an appropriate response to Lisa's question? 2.Identify the priority psychosocial nursing diagnosis for Lisa. 3.What must the nurse ensure that Lisa learns from this experience? Communication Exercises 1.Sarah is being treated in the emergency department for wounds inflicted by her husband. Sandy says tothe nurse, \"He's really not a bad person.

Additional focus is placed on tertiary pre-vention of mental illness: treatment with communityresources of those who suffer from severe and persist-ent mental illness and homeless persons with mentalillness. Emphasis is given to the role of the psychiatricnurse in the various treatment alternatives within thecommunity setting. The Changing Focus of Care Before 1840, there was no known treatment for indi-viduals with mental illness. Because mental illness wasperceived as incurable, the only \"reasonable\" inter-vention was thought to be removing these individualsfrom the community to a place where they would dono harm to themselves or others. In 1841, Dorothea Dix, a former schoolteacher, began a personal crusade across the land on behalfof institutionalized individuals with mental illness.Her efforts resulted in more humane treatment ofthese clients and the establishment of a number ofpsychiatric hospitals. After the movement initiated by Dix, the number of hospitals for persons with mental illness increased,although unfortunately not as rapidly as did the pop-ulation with mental illness. The demand soon out-grew the supply, and hospitals became overcrowdedand understaffed, with conditions that would havesorely distressed Dorothea Dix. The community mental health movement had its impetus in the 1940s. With establishment of the National Mental Health Act of 1946, the U.S. govern-ment awarded grants to the states to develop mentalhealth programs outside of state hospitals. Outpatientclinics and psychiatric units in general hospitals wereinaugurated. Then, in 1949, as an outgrowth of theNational Mental Health Act, the National Institute ofMental Health (NIMH) was established. The U.S. gov-ernment has charged this agency with the responsi-bility for mental health in the United States. In 1955, the Joint Commission on Mental Health and Illness was established by Congress to identify thenation's mental health needs and to make recommen-dations for improvement in psychiatric care. In 1961,the Joint Commission published the report, Action forMental Health, in which recommendations were made for treatment of clients with mental illness, trainingfor caregivers, and improvements in education and re-search on mental illness. With consideration given tothese recommendations, Congress passed the MentalRetardation Facilities and Community Mental HealthCenters Construction Act (often called the CommunityMental Health Centers Act) of 1963. This act calledfor the construction of comprehensive communitymental health centers, the cost of which would beshared by federal and state governments. The deinsti- tutionalization movement (the closing of state mental hospitals and discharging of individuals with mentalillness) had begun. Unfortunately, many state governments did not have the capability to match the federal funds re-quired for the establishment of these mental healthcenters. Some communities found it difficult to followthe rigid requirements for services required by thelegislation that provided the grant. In 1980 the Community Mental Health Systems Act, which was to have played a major role in renova-tion of mental health care, was established. Fundingwas authorized for community mental health centers,for services to high-risk populations, and for rape re-search and services. Approval was also granted for theappointment of an associate director for minorityconcerns at NIMH. However, before this plan couldbe enacted, the newly inaugurated administration setforth its intention to diminish federal involvement.Budget cuts reduced the number of mandated serv-ices, and federal funding for community mentalhealth centers was terminated in 1984. Meanwhile, costs of care for hospitalized psychi- atric clients continued to rise. The problem of the \"re-volving door\" began to intensify. Individuals withsevere and persistent mental illness had no place togo when their symptoms exacerbated, except back tothe hospital. Individuals without support systems re-mained in the hospital for extended periods becauseof lack of appropriate community services. Hospitalservices were paid for by cost-based, retrospective re-imbursement: Medicaid, Medicare, and private healthinsurance. Retrospective reimbursement encouragedhospital expenditure; the more services provided, themore payment received. This system of delivery of health care was interrupted in 1983 with the advent of prospective payment\u2014the Reagan administration's proposal of cost containment.It was directed at control of Medicare costs by settingforth preestablished amounts that would be reim-bursed for specific diagnoses, or diagnosis-relatedgroups (DRGs) . Since that time, prospective payment has also been integrated by the states (Medicaid) andby some private insurance companies, drastically af-fecting the amount of reimbursement for health-careservices. Mental health services have been influenced by prospective payment. General hospital services to psy-chiatric clients have been severely restricted. Clientswho present with acute symptoms, such as acute psy-chosis, suicidal ideations or attempts, or manic exac-erbations, constitute the largest segment of the 4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:51 PM Page 799psychiatric hospital census. Clients with less serious illnesses (e.g., moderate depression or adjustment dis-orders) may be hospitalized, but length of stay hasbeen shortened considerably by the reimbursementguidelines. Clients are being discharged from the hos-pital with a greater need for aftercare than in the past,when hospital stays were longer. Deinstitutionalization continues to be the chang- ing focus of mental health care in the United States.Care for the client in the hospital has become costprohibitive, whereas care for the client in the commu-nity is cost effective. The reality of the provision ofhealth-care services today is often more of a politicaland funding issue than providers would care to admit.Decisions about how to treat are rarely made withoutconsideration of cost and method of payment. Provision of outpatient mental health services not only is the wave of the future, it is the reality of today.We must serve the consumer by providing the essen-tial services to assist with health promotion or preven-tion, to initiate early intervention, and to ensurerehabilitation or prevention of long-term disability. The Public Health Model The premise of the model of public health is basedlargely on the concepts set forth by Gerald Caplan(1964) during the initial community mental healthmovement. They include primary prevention, second-ary prevention, and tertiary prevention. These con-cepts no longer have relevance only to mental health;rather, they have been widely adapted as guiding prin-ciples in many clinical and community settings over arange of medical and nursing specialties.Teaching techniques of stress management to virtually anyone who desires to learn Teaching groups of individuals ways to cope withthe changes associated with various maturationalstages Teaching concepts of mental health to variousgroups within the community Providing education and support to unemployedor homeless individuals Providing education and support to other individ-uals in various transitional periods (e.g., widowsand widowers, new retirees, and women enteringthe workforce in middle life) These are only a few examples of the types of services nurses provide in primary prevention. Such services canbe offered in a variety of settings that are convenientfor the public (e.g., churches, schools, colleges, com-munity centers, YMCAs and YWCAs, workplaces of em-ployee organizations, meetings of women's groups, orcivic or social organizations such as parent-teacher associations, health fairs, and community shelters). Secondary prevention is accomplished through early identification of problems and prompt initiationof effective treatment. Nursing in secondary preven-tion focuses on recognition of symptoms and provi-sion of, or referral for, treatment. Examples include: Ongoing assessment of individuals at high risk for ill-ness exacerbation (e.g., during home visits, day care,community health centers, or in any setting wherescreening of high-risk individuals might occur) Provision of care for individuals in whom illnesssymptoms have been assessed (e.g., individual orgroup counseling, medication administration, ed-ucation and support during period of increasedstress [crisis intervention], staffing rape crisis cen-ters, suicide hotlines, homeless shelters, shelters forabused persons, or mobile mental health units) Referral for treatment of individuals in whom ill-ness symptoms have been assessed. Referrals maycome from support groups, community mentalhealth centers, emergency services, psychiatrists orpsychologists, and day or partial hospitalization. In-patient therapy on a psychiatric unit of a generalhospital or in a private psychiatric hospital may benecessary. Psychopharmacology and various adjuncttherapies may be initiated as part of the treatment.800 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations CORE CONCEPT Primary Prevention Services aimed at reducing the incidence of mental disorders within the population. CORE CONCEPT Secondary Prevention Interventions aimed at minimizing early symptoms of psychiatric illness and directed toward reducing theprevalence and duration of the illness. Primary prevention targets both individuals and the environment. Emphasis is twofold: 1. Assisting individuals to increase their ability to cope effectively with stress. 2. Targeting and diminishing harmful forces (stres- sors) within the environment. Nursing in primary prevention is focused on the targeting of groups at risk and the provision of edu- cational programs. Examples include: Teaching parenting skills and child developmentto prospective new parents Teaching physical and psychosocial effects of alcohol/drugs to elementary school students4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:51 PM Page 800CHAPTER 36 Community Mental Health Nursing 801 Secondary prevention has been addressed extensively in Unit 4 of this text. Nursing assessment, diagnosis/ outcome identification, planning/implementation,and evaluation were discussed for many of the mentalillnesses identified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (American Psy-chiatric Association [APA], 2013). These concepts maybe applied in any setting where nursing is practiced. Tertiary prevention is accomplished in two ways: 1. Preventing complications of the illness2. Promoting rehabilitation that is directed toward achievement of each individual's maximum levelof functioning Historically, individuals with severe and persistent mental illness often experienced long hospitaliza-tions that resulted in loss of social skills and in-creased dependency. With deinstitutionalization,many of these individuals may never have experi-enced hospitalization, but they still do not possessadequate skills to live productive lives within thecommunity. Nursing in tertiary prevention focuses on helping clients learn or relearn socially appropriate behaviorsso that they may achieve a satisfying role within thecommunity. Examples include: Consideration of the rehabilitation process at thetime of initial diagnosis and treatment planning Teaching the client daily living skills and encourag-ing independence to his or her maximum ability Referring clients for various aftercare services (e.g.,support groups, day treatment programs, partialhospitalization programs, psychosocial rehabilita-tion programs, group home or other transitionalhousing) Monitoring effectiveness of aftercare services (e.g.,through home health visits or follow-up appoint-ments in community mental health centers) Making referrals for support services when required(e.g., some communities have programs linking in-dividuals with serious mental disorders to volunteerswho serve to develop friendships with the individualsand who may assist with household chores, shop-ping, and other activities of daily living with whichthe individual is having difficulty, in addition to par-ticipating in social activities with the individual) Nursing care at the tertiary level of prevention can be administered on an individual or group basis andin a variety of settings, such as inpatient hospitaliza-tion, day or partial hospitalization, group home orhalfway house, shelters, home health care, nursinghomes, and community mental health centers. The Community as Client Primary PreventionCORE CONCEPT Tertiary Prevention Services aimed at reducing the residual defects that are associated with severe and persistent mental illness. IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE McDevitt, J., Snyder, M., Miller, A., & Wilbur, J. (2006). Perceptions of barriers and benefits to physical activityamong outpatients in psychiatric rehabilitation. Journal of Nursing Scholarship, 38 (1), 50-55. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to explore perceived barriers and benefits to physicalactivity in people with serious and persistent mental ill-ness (SP M I) who were enrolled in community-based psy- chiatric rehabilitation. The sample included 34 participants(16 men and 18 women) aged 18 to 50 from two community-based psychiatric rehabilitation centers in alarge Midwestern urban area. Ethnic breakdown included24 African Americans, 7 Whites, and 3 of Hispanic or un-known ethnicity. Four focus groups lasting 50 minuteseach were held over a 3-week period, with 7 to 9 partici-pants in each group. Themes of the focus groups includedbarriers and benefits of physical activity. RESULTS OF THE STUDY: Barriers to physical activity identified by the study par ticipants included symptoms of the mental illness itself , being medicated, gaining weight, being in a CORE CONCEPT Community A group, population, or cluster of people with at least one common characteristic, such as geographic loca-tion, occupation, ethnicity, or health concern (Langley,2002). Primary prevention within communities encom- passes the twofold emphasis defined earlier in this chapter. These include: 1. Identifying stressful life events that precipitate crises and targeting the relevant populations athigh risk. Continued4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:51 PM Page 8012. Intervening with these high-risk populations to prevent or minimize harmful consequences. Populations at Risk One way to view populations at risk is to focus on types of crises that individuals experience in theirlives. Two broad categories are maturational crisesand situational crises. Maturational Crises Maturational crises are crucial experiences that areassociated with various stages of growth and develop-ment. Erikson (1963) described eight stages of the lifecycle during which individuals struggle with develop-mental \"tasks.\" Crises can occur during any of thesestages, although several developmental periods andlife-cycle events have been recognized as having increased crisis potential: adolescence, marriage, parenthood, midlife, and retirement. Adolescence The task for adolescence according to Erikson (1963) is identity versus role confusion . This is the time in life when individuals ask questions suchas \"Who am I?\" \"Where am I going?\" and \"What lifeall about?\" Adolescence is a transition into young adult- hood. It is a very volatile time in most families. Com-monly, there is conflict over issues of control.Parents sometimes have difficulty relinquishingeven a minimal amount of the control they havehad throughout their child's infancy, toddler, andschool-age years, at this time when the adolescent isseeking increased independence. It may seem thatthe adolescent is 25 years old one day and 5 yearsold the next. An often-quoted definition of an adolescent, by an anonymous author, is: \"A toddlerwith hormones and wheels.\" At this time, adolescents are \"trying out their wings,\" although they possess an essential need to knowthat the parents (or surrogate parents) are availableif support is required. Mahler, Pine, and Bergman(1975) have termed this vital concept \"emotional re-fueling,\" and although they were referring to toddlerswhen they coined the term, it is highly applicable toadolescents as well. In fact, it is believed that the mostfrequent immediate precipitant to adolescent suicideis loss, or threat of loss, or abandonment by parentsor closest peer relationship. Adolescents have many issues to deal with and many choices to make. Some of these include issues that re-late to self-esteem and body image (in a body that isundergoing rapid changes), peer relationships (withboth genders), education and career selection, estab-lishing a set of values and ideals, sexuality and sexualexperimentation (including issues of birth control andprevention of sexually transmitted diseases), drug andalcohol use, and physical appearance. Nursing interventions with adolescents at the pri- mary level of prevention focus on providing supportand accurate information to ease the difficult transi-tion they are undergoing. Educational offerings can bepresented in schools, churches, youth centers, or anylocation in which groups of teenagers gather. Types ofprograms may include (but are not limited to): Alateen groups for adolescents with alcoholic parent(s) Other support groups for teenagers who are inneed of assistance to cope with stressful situations(e.g., children dealing with divorce of their 802 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE\u2014 cont'd rehabilitation program, and living in urban neighborhoods. They cited symptoms of lethargy and lack of initiative (fromeither the medication or the illness) and weight gain fromthe medications interfering with physical activity. Neighbor-hood safety concerns and being identified as a person witha mental disorder were also identified. Benefits of physicalactivity cited included feeling more energetic, less stressed,and improved sleep. Keeping busy and providing distrac-tion from problems were also recognized. Both men andwomen suggested they would appreciate exercise and ac-tivities for same-gender groups. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Several recom- mendations from the par ticipants emerged from the focus g roups. Some of these included the following: \u0081 Need a good leader who encourages, but does not coerce; provides participants with choices\u0081 Groups that provide relevant information that pertains to client health concerns, such as weight gain, and how to address these concerns \u0081 Offer group support, but provide individual options as well. \u0081 Offer a choice of different types of activities, to re- duce boredom The authors of this study stated, \"Confronting how atti- tudes and barriers specific to this population can affect ac- tivity and reframing program compliance to include theindependent initiation of activity as part of improving healthshould assist clients of mental health services to becomemore active\" (p. 55).4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:51 PM Page 802CHAPTER 36 Community Mental Health Nursing 803 parents, pregnant teenagers, teenagers coping with abortion, adolescents coping with the death of aparent) Educational programs that inform about and vali-date bodily changes and emotions about whichthere may be some concerns Educational programs that inform about nutri-tional needs specific for this age group Educational programs that inform about sexuality,pregnancy, contraception, and sexually transmitteddiseases Educational programs that inform about the use ofalcohol and other drugs Marriage The \"American dream\" of the 1950s\u2014espe-cially that of the American woman\u2014was to marry , have two or three children, buy a house in the sub-urbs, and drive a station wagon. To not be at least be-trothed by their mid-20s caused many women to fearbecoming an \"old maid.\" Living together without thebenefit of marriage was an unacceptable and rarelyconsidered option. Times have changed considerably since the middle of the 20th century. Today's young women are choos-ing to pursue careers before entering into marriage,to continue their careers after marriage, or to notmarry at all. Many couples are deciding to live to-gether without being married, and, as with mosttrends, the practice now receives more widespread societal acceptance than it once did. Why is marriage considered one of the most com- mon maturational crises? Sheehy (1976), in her classic volume about life's passages, wrote: No two people can possibly coordinate all their de- velopmental crises. The timing of outside opportuni-ties will almost never be the same. But moreimportantly, each one has an inner life structure withits own idiosyncrasies. Depending on what has gonebefore, each one will alternate differently betweentimes of feeling full of certainty, hope, and height-ened potential and times of feeling vulnerable, unfo-cused, and scared. (p. 138) Additional conflicts sometimes also arise when the marriage is influenced by crossovers in religion, eth- nicity, social status, or race, although these types ofdifferences have become more individually and soci-etally acceptable than they once were. Nursing interventions at the primary level of pre- vention with individuals in this stage of developmentinvolve education regarding what to expect at variousstages in the marriage. Many high schools now offercourses in marriage and family living in which studentsrole-play through anticipatory marriage and family sit-uations. Nurses could offer these kinds of classeswithin the community to individuals considering marriage. Too many people enter marriage with thenotion that, as sure as the depth of their love, theirsoon-to-be husband or wife will discontinue his or her\"undesirable\" traits and change into the perceivedideal spouse. Primary prevention with these individu-als involves: Encouraging honest communication Determining what each person expects from therelationship Ascertaining whether or not each individual canaccept compromise This type of intervention can be effective in indi- vidual or couple's therapy and in support or educa-tional groups of couples experiencing similarcircumstances. Parenthood Murray, Zentner, and Yakimo (2009) state: The coming of the child is a developmental and sometimes situational crisis, a turning point in thecouple's life in which old patterns of living must bechanged for new ways of living and new values. Withthe advent of parenthood, a couple is embarking ona journey from which there is no return. To put it sim-ply, parents cannot quit. The child's birth brings finality to many privileges and a permanence of responsibilities. (p. 249) There is perhaps no developmental stage that cre- ates an upheaval equal to that of the arrival of a child. Even when the child is desperately wanted and pleas-urably anticipated, his or her arrival usually results insome degree of chaos within the family. Because the family operates as a system, the addi- tion of a new member influences all parts of the sys-tem as a whole. If it is a first child, the relationshipbetween the spouses is likely to be affected by the de-mands of caring for the infant on a 24-hour basis. Ifthere are older children, they may resent the atten-tion showered on the new arrival and show their resentment in a variety of creative ways. The concept of having a child (particularly the first one) is often romanticized, with little or noconsideration given to the realities and responsibil-ities that accompany this \"bundle of joy.\" Manyyoung parents are shocked to realize that such a tinyhuman can create so many changes in so many lives.It is unfortunate that although parenting is one ofthe most important positions an individual will holdin life, it is one for which he or she is often least prepared. Nursing intervention at the primary level of pre- vention with those in the developmental stage of par-enthood must begin long before the child is evenborn. How do we prepare individuals for parent-hood? Anticipatory guidance is the term used to de- scribe the interventions used to help new parentsknow what they might expect. Volumes have been4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:51 PM Page 803written on the subject, but it is also important for ex- pectant parents to have a support person or networkwith whom they can talk, express feelings, excite-ment, and fears. Nurses can provide the followingtype of information to help ease the transition intoparenthood (Mandleco, 2004; Murray et al., 2009;Spock, 2012). Prepared childbirth classes: These classes present what most likely will happen, but with additionalinformation about possible variations from thatwhich is expected. Information about what to expect after the babyarrives: Parent-infant bonding. Expectant parents should know that it is common for parent-infant bond-ing not to occur immediately. The strong attach-ment will occur as parent and infant get to knoweach other. Changing husband-wife relationships. The couple should be encouraged to engage in open honestcommunication and role-playing of typical situa-tions that are likely to arise after the baby becomes a part of the family. Clothing and equipment. Expectant parents need to know what is required to care for a newbornchild. Family economics, space available, andlifestyle should be considered. Feeding. Advantages and disadvantages of breast- feeding and formula feeding should be pre-sented. The couple should be supported inwhatever method is chosen. Anticipatory guid-ance related to technique should be provided forone or both methods, as the expectant parentsrequest. Other expectations. It is important for expectant parents to receive anticipatory guidance aboutthe infant's sleeping and crying patterns, bathingthe infant, care of the circumcision and cord,toys that provide stimulation of the newborn'ssenses, aspects of providing a safe environment,and when to call the physician. Stages of growth and development: It is very impor- tant for parents to understand what behaviorsshould be expected at what stage of development.It is also important to know that their child may notnecessarily follow the age guidelines associatedwith these stages. However, a substantial deviationfrom these guidelines should be reported to theirphysician. Midlife What is middle age? A colleague once re-marked that upon turning 50 years of age she stated,\"Now I can say I am officially middle aged . . . until Ibegan thinking about how few individuals I reallyknew who were 100!\"Midlife crises are not defined by a specific number. V arious sources in the literature identify these con- flicts as occurring anytime between age 35 and 65. What is a midlife crisis? This, too, is very individual, but a number of patterns have been identified withinthree broad categories: 1. An alteration in perception of the self. One's per- ception of self may occur slowly. One may sud- denly become aware of being \"old\" or \"middleaged.\" Murray and associates (2009) stated: Now the person looks in the mirror and sees changes that others may have noticed some timeago. Gray , thinning hair, wrinkles, coarsening fea- tures, decreased muscular tone, weight gain, vari-cosities, and capillary breakage may be the firstsigns of impending age. (p. 569) Other biological changes that occur naturally with the aging process may also affect the crises thatoccur at this time. In women, a gradual decreasein the production of estrogen initiates themenopause, which results in a variety of physicaland emotional symptoms. Some physical symp-toms include \"hot flashes,\" vaginal dryness, cessa-tion of menstruation, loss of reproductive ability,night sweats, insomnia, headaches, and minormemory disturbances. Emotional symptoms in-clude anxiety, depression, crying for no reason,and temper outbursts. Although the menopausal period in men is not as evident as it is in women, most clinicians subscribeto the belief that men undergo a climacteric expe-rience related to the gradual decrease in produc-tion of testosterone. Although sperm productiondiminishes with advancing age, there is usually nocomplete cessation, as there is of ovum productionin women at menopause (Scanlon & Sanders,2011). Some men experience hot flashes, sweating,chills, dizziness, and heart palpitations (Murray etal., 2009), whereas others may experience severedepression and an overall decline in physical vigor(Sadock & Sadock, 2007). An alteration in sexualfunctioning is not uncommon (see Chapter 34). 2. An alteration in perception of others. A change in relationship with adult children requires a sensitiveshift in caring. Wright and Leahey (2013) state: The family of origin must relinquish the primar y roles of parent and child. They must adapt to thenew roles of parent and adult child. This involvesrenegotiation of emotional and financial com-mitments. The key emotional process during thisstage is for family members to deal with a multi-tude of exits from and entries into the family system. (p. 107)804 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:51 PM Page 804CHAPTER 36 Community Mental Health Nursing 805 These experiences are particularly difficult when parents' values conflict with the relationships andtypes of lifestyles their children choose. An alter-ation in perception of one's parents also begins tooccur during this time. Having always looked toparents for support and comfort, the middle-agedindividual may suddenly find that the roles are be-ginning to reverse. Aging parents may look to theirchildren for assistance with making decisions re-garding their everyday lives and for assistance withchores that they have previously accomplished independently. When parents die, middle-aged in-dividuals must come to terms with their own mor-tality. The process of recognition and resolution ofone's own finitude begins in earnest at this time. 3. An alteration in perception of time. Middle age has been defined as the end of youth and the begin-ning of old age. Individuals often experience asense that time is running out: \"I haven't done all I want to do or accomplished all I intended to ac-complish!\" Depression and a sense of loss mayoccur as individuals realize that some of the goalsestablished in their youth may go unmet. The term \"empty nest syndrome\" has been used to describe the adjustment period parents experiencewhen the last child leaves home to establish an in-dependent residence. The crisis is often more pro-found for the mother who has devoted her life tonurturing her family . As the last child leaves, she may perceive her future as uncertain and meaningless. Some women who have devoted their lives to rear- ing their children decide to develop personal in-terests and pursue personal goals once the childrenare grown. This occurs at a time when many hus-bands have begun to decrease what may have beena compulsive drive for occupational security duringthe earlier years of their lives. This disparity in com-mon goals may create conflict between husbandand wife. At a time when she is experiencing morevalue in herself and her own life, he may begin tofeel less valued. This may also relate to a decreasein the amount of time and support from the wifeto which the husband has become accustomed.This type of role change will require numerousadaptations on the part of both spouses. Finally, an alteration in one's perception of time may be related to the societal striving for eternal youth.The individual may try to delay the external changesthat come with aging by the use of cosmetics, hor-mone creams, or even surgery. This yearning foryouth may take the form of sexual promiscuity or ex-tramarital affairs with much younger individuals, inan effort to prove that one \"still has what it takes.\"Some individuals reach for the trappings of youthwith regressive-type behaviors, such as the middle-aged man who buys a motorcycle and joins a motor-cycle club, and the 50-year-old woman who wearsminiskirts and flirts with her daughter's boyfriends.These individuals may be denying their own pastand experience. With a negative view of self, theystrongly desire to relive their youth. Nursing intervention at the primary level of pre- vention with those in the developmental stage ofmidlife involves providing accurate information re-garding changes that occur during this time of lifeand support for adapting to these changes effectively.These interventions might include: Nutrition classes to inform individuals in this agegroup about the essentials of diet and exercise. Educational materials on how to avoid obesity orreduce weight can be included, along with the importance of good nutrition. Assistance with ways to improve health (e.g., quitsmoking, cease or reduce alcohol consumption, re-duce fat intake). Discussions of the importance of having regularphysical examinations, including Pap and breast ex-aminations for women and prostate examinationsfor men. Monthly breast self-examinations shouldbe taught and yearly mammograms encouraged. Classes on menopause should be given. Provide in-formation about what to expect. Myths thatabound regarding this topic should be expelled.Support groups for women (and men) undergoingthe menopausal experience could be formed. Support and information related to physicalchanges occurring in the body during this time oflife. Assist with the grief response that some indi-viduals will experience in relation to loss of youth,\"empty nest,\" and sense of identity. Support and information related to care of agingparents should be given. Individuals should be referred to community resources for respite and assistance before strain of the caregiver role threat-ens to disrupt the family system. Retirement Retirement, which is often anticipated asan achievement in principle, may be met with a greatdeal of ambivalence when it actually occurs. Our society places a great deal of importance on produc-tivity and on earning as much money as possible at asyoung an age as possible. These types of values con-tribute to the ambivalence associated with retirement.Although leisure has been acknowledged as a legiti-mate reward for workers, leisure during retirementhas never been accorded the same social value. Adjustment to this life-cycle event becomes more dif-ficult in the face of societal values that are in directconflict with the new lifestyle.4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:51 PM Page 805Historically, many women have derived much of their self-esteem from having children, rearing chil- dren, and being a \"good mother.\" Likewise, manymen have achieved self-esteem through work-relatedactivities\u2014creativity, productivity, and earning money.Termination of these activities can result in a loss ofself-worth, and individuals who are unable to adaptsatisfactorily may become depressed. It would appear that retirement is becoming, and will continue to become, more accepted by societalstandards. With more and more individuals retiringearlier and living longer, the growing number of aging persons will spend a significantly longertime in retirement. At present, retirement has become more of an institutionalized expectation,and there appears to be increasing acceptance of itas a social status. Nursing intervention at the primary level of preven- tion with the developmental task of retirement involvesproviding information and support to individuals whohave retired or are considering retirement. Supportcan be on a one-to-one basis to assist these individualsto sort out their feelings regarding retirement. Well-being in retirement is linked to factors such as stablehealth status and access to health-care services, ade-quate income, the ability to pursue new goals or activ-ities, extended social network of family and friends,and satisfaction with current living arrangements(Murray et al., 2009). Support can also be provided in a group environ- ment. Support groups of individuals undergoingthe same types of experiences can be extremelyhelpful. Nurses can form and lead these types ofgroups to assist retiring individuals through this crit-ical period. These groups can also serve to provideinformation about available resources that offer as-sistance to individuals in or nearing retirement,such as information concerning Medicare, SocialSecurity, and Medicaid; information related to or-ganizations that specialize in hiring retirees; and in-formation regarding ways to use newly acquired freetime constructively. Situational Crises Situational crises are acute responses that occur as aresult of an external circumstantial stressor. The num-ber and types of situational stressors are limitless andmay be real or exist only in the perception of the in-dividual. Some types of situational crises that put in-dividuals at risk for mental illness include thefollowing. Poverty A number of studies have identified poverty as a direct correlation to emotional illness. This mayhave to do with the direct consequences of poverty, such as inadequate and crowded living conditions,nutritional deficiencies, medical neglect, unemploy-ment, or being homeless. High Rate of Life Change Events Miller and Rahe (1997) found that frequent changes in life patterns due to a large number of significant events occurringin close proximity tend to decrease a person's ability to deal with stress, and physical or emotional illnessmay be the result. These include life change eventssuch as death of a loved one, divorce, being firedfrom a job, a change in living conditions, a change inplace of employment or residence, physical illness, ora change in body image caused by the loss of a bodypart or function. Envir onmental Conditions Environmental conditions can create situational crises. Tornados, floods, hurri- canes, and earthquakes have wreaked devastation on thousands of individuals and families in recent years. T rauma Individuals who have encountered traumatic experiences must be considered at risk for emotional illness. These include traumatic experiences usuallyconsidered outside the range of usual human experi-ence, such as rape, war, physical attack, torture, or natural or manmade disaster. Nursing intervention at the primary level of pre- vention with individuals experiencing situationalcrises is aimed at maintaining the highest possiblelevel of functioning while offering support and assis-tance with problem solving during the crisis period.Interventions for nursing of clients in crisis includethe following: Use a reality-oriented approach. The focus of theproblem is on the here and now. Remain with the individual who is experiencingpanic anxiety. Establish a rapid working relationship by showingunconditional acceptance, by active listening, andby attending to immediate needs. Discourage lengthy explanations or rationaliza-tions of the situation; promote an atmosphere forverbalization of true feelings. Set firm limits on aggressive, destructive behaviors.At high levels of anxiety, behavior is likely to be im-pulsive and regressive. Establish at the outset what isacceptable and what is not, and maintain consistency. Clarify the problem that the individual is facing.The nurse does this by describing his or her per-ception of the problem and comparing it with theindividual's perception of the problem. Help the individual determine what he or she be-lieves precipitated the crisis. Acknowledge feelings of anger, guilt, helplessness,and powerlessness, while taking care not to providepositive feedback for these feelings.806 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:51 PM Page 806CHAPTER 36 Community Mental Health Nursing 807 Guide the individual through a problem-solving process by which he or she may move in the direc-tion of positive life change: Help the individual confront the source of theproblem that is creating the crisis response. Encourage the individual to discuss changes heor she would like to make. Jointly determinewhether desired changes are realistic. Encourage exploration of feelings about aspectsthat cannot be changed, and explore alternativeways of coping more adaptively in these situations. Discuss alternative strategies for creating changein situations that can realistically be changed. Weigh benefits and consequences of each alternative. Assist the individual to select alternative copingstrategies that will help alleviate future crises. Identify external support systems and new socialnetworks from which the individual may seek assis-tance in times of stress. Nursing at the level of primary prevention focuses largely on education of the client to prevent initiationor exacerbation of mental illness. An example of justone type of teaching plan for use in primary preven-tion situations is presented in Table 36-1. Secondary Prevention Populations at Risk Secondary prevention within communities relates tousing early detection and prompt intervention withindividuals experiencing mental illness symptoms.The same maturational and situational crises thatwere presented in the previous section on primaryprevention are used to discuss intervention at the sec-ondary level of prevention. Maturational Crises Adolescence The need for intervention at the second- ary level of prevention in adolescence occurs when disruptive and age-inappropriate behaviors becomethe norm, and the family can no longer cope adap-tively with the situation. All levels of dysfunction areconsidered\u2014from dysfunctional family coping to theneed for hospitalization of the adolescent. Nursing inter vention with the adolescent at the secondary level of prevention may occur in the com-munity setting at community mental health centers,physician's offices, schools, public health depart-ments, and crisis intervention centers. Nurses maywork with families to problem-solve and improve cop-ing and communication skills, or they may work on aone-to-one basis with the adolescent in an attempt tomodify behavior patterns. Adolescents may be hospitalized for a variety of problems, including (but not limited to) conduct disorders, adjustment disorders, eating disorders, substance-related disorders, depression, and anxietydisorders. Inpatient care is determined by severity ofsymptomatology. Nursing care of adolescents in thehospital setting focuses on problem identification andstabilizing a crisis situation. Once stability has beenachieved, clients are commonly discharged to outpa-tient care. If an adolescent's home situation has beendeemed unsatisfactory, the state may take custody andthe child is then discharged to a group or fosterhome. Care plans for intervention with the adolescentat the secondary level of prevention can be found inChapter 33 and in other chapters that address thespecific diagnoses. Marriage Problems in a marriage are as far-reaching as the individuals who experience them. Problems thatare not uncommon to the disruption of a marriage re-lationship include substance abuse on the part of oneor both partners and disagreements on issues of sex,money, children, gender roles, and infidelity , among others. Murray and associates (2009) state: Marriage to one person and living with the frustra- tions, conflicts, and boredom that is part of any closeand lengthy relationship requires constant work byboth parties. (p. 504) Nursing intervention at the secondary level of pre- vention with individuals encountering marriage prob- lems may include one or more of the following: Counseling with the couple or with one of thespouses on a one-to-one basis Referral to a couples' support group Identification of the problem and possible solutions;support and guidance as changes are undertaken Referral to a sex therapist Referral to a financial advisor Referral to parent effectiveness training Murray and associates (2009) state: When marriage fails and bonds are broken, alone- ness, anger, mistrust, hostility, guilt, shame, a sense ofbetrayal, fear, disappointment, loss of identity, anxi-ety, and depression, alone or in combination, may ap-pear both in the divorcee and the one initiating thedivorce. (p. 547) In Miller and Rahe's (1997) life change question- naire, only death of a spouse or other family member scored higher than divorce in severity of stress expe-rienced. This is an area in which nurses can interveneto help ease the transition and prevent emotionalbreakdown. In community health settings, nurses canlead support groups for newly divorced individuals.They can also provide one-to-one counseling for in-dividuals experiencing the emotional chaos engen-dered by the dissolution of a marriage relationship.4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:51 PM Page 807808 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special PopulationsTABLE 36-1 Client Education for Primary Prevention: Drugs of Abuse EFFECTS ON THE BODY (CHRONIC OR CLASS OF DRUGS EFFECTS SYMPTOMS OF OVERDOSE TRADE NAMES COMMON NAMES HIGH-DOSE USE) (barbiturates and drugs Cocaine loss of in- hibitions, lack of concentration,drowsiness, slurredspeech, Same as alcohol Red birds Yellow birdsBlue pep pills, wake- ups, bennies, eye- openers, speed,black beauties, sweet A's Coke, flake, snow, dust, happy dust, golddust, girl, Cecil, C,toot, blow, crack Bath salts, bliss, vanilla sky, ivory wave, purple wavePeripheral nerve muscle wast-ing, encephalopathy,psychosis, cardiomy-opathy, gastritis,esophagitis, pancreati-tis, hepatitis, cirrhosisof REM sleep, respiratory depression,hypotension, possiblekidney or liver dam-age, sexual hyper-tension Pulmonary hemorrhage, behavior4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 809OPIOIDS HALLUCINOGENS CANNABINOLSEuphoria, lethargy, drowsiness, lack con-fusion, horse M, morph, Miss Emma SchoolboyLordsDoctorsDolliesPerkiesT'sBig O, black stuff Acid, cube, big D Angel dust, hog, peace pill MescBusinessman's tripSerenity and peaceEcstasy, XTCSpecial K, Vitamin K, Kit Kat Marijuana, pot, grass, joint, Mary Jane, MJ Hash, rope, Sweet depression, constipation, fecal 809Divorce also has an impact on the children involved. Nurses can intervene with the children of divorce in an effort to prevent dysfunctional behaviors associatedwith the break-up of a marriage. Parenthood Intervention at the secondary level of pre- vention with parents can be required for a number ofreasons. A few of these include: Physical, emotional, or sexual abuse of a child Physical or emotional neglect of a child Birth of a child with special needs Diagnosis of a terminal illness in a child Death of a child Nursing intervention at the secondary level of pre- vention includes being able to recognize the physicaland behavioral signs that indicate possible abuse of achild. The child may be cared for in the emergencydepartment or as an inpatient on the pediatric unitor child psychiatric unit of a general hospital. Nursing intervention with parents may include teaching effective methods of disciplining children,aside from physical punishment. Methods that em-phasize the importance of positive reinforcementfor acceptable behavior can be very effective. Familymembers must be committed to consistent use ofthis behavior modification technique for it to be successful. Parents should also be informed about behavioral expectations at the various levels of development.Knowledge of what to expect from children at thesevarious stages may provide needed anticipatory guid-ance to deal with the crises commonly associated witheach stage. Therapy sessions with all family members together may focus on problems with family communications.Members are encouraged to express honest feelingsin a manner that is nonthreatening to other familymembers. Active listening, assertiveness techniques,and respect for the rights of others are taught and encouraged. Barriers to effective communication areidentified and resolved. Referrals to agencies that promote effective par- enting skills may be made (e.g., parent effectivenesstraining). Alternative agencies that may provide relieffrom the stress of parenting may also be considered(e.g., \"Mom's Day Out\" programs, sitter-sharing or-ganizations, and day-care institutions). Supportgroups for abusive parents may also be helpful and as-sistance in locating or initiating such a group may beprovided. The nurse can assist parents who are grieving the loss of a child or the birth of a child with special needsby helping them to express their true feelings associ-ated with the loss. Feelings such as shock, denial,anger, guilt, powerlessness, and hopelessness need tobe expressed in order for the parents to progressthrough the grief response. Home health-care assistance can be provided for the family of a child with special needs. This can be done bymaking referrals to other professionals, such as speech,physical, and occupational therapists; medical socialworkers; psychologists; and nutritionists. If the child withspecial needs is hospitalized, the home health nurse canprovide specific information to hospital staff that maybe helpful in providing continuity of care for the clientand help in the transition for the family. Nursing intervention also includes providing assis- tance in the location of and referral to support groupsthat deal with loss of a child or birth of a child withspecial needs. Some nurses may serve as leaders ofthese types of groups in the community. Midlife Nursing care at the secondary level of preven- tion during midlife becomes necessary when the in- dividual is unable to integrate all of the changes thatare occurring during this period. An inability to ac-cept the physical and biological changes, the changesin relationships between themselves and their adultchildren and aging parents, and the loss of the per-ception of youth may result in depression for whichthe individual may require help to resolve. Retirement Retirement can also result in depression for individuals who are unable to satisfactorily grievefor the loss of this aspect of their lives. This is morelikely to occur if the individuals have not planned forretirement and if they have derived most of their self-esteem from their employment. Nursing intervention at the secondar y level of pre- vention with depressed individuals takes place in bothinpatient and outpatient settings. Severely depressedclients with suicidal ideations will need close observa-tion in the hospital setting, whereas those with mildto moderate depression may be treated in the com-munity. A plan of care for the client with depressionis found in Chapter 25. These concepts apply to thesecondary level of prevention and may be used in allnursing care settings. The physician may elect to use pharmacotherapy with antidepressants. Nurses may intervene by provid-ing information to the client about what to expectfrom the medication, possible side effects, adverse effects, and how to self-administer the medication. Situational Crises Nursing care at the secondary level of prevention withclients undergoing situational crises occurs only if crisisintervention at the primary level failed and the individ-ual is unable to function socially or occupationally. Exacerbation of mental illness symptoms requires intervention at the secondary level of prevention.810 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:51 PM Page 810CHAPTER 36 Community Mental Health Nursing 811 These disorders were addressed extensively in Unit 4. Nursing assessment, diagnosis and outcome identifica-tion, planning, and implementation, and evaluationwere discussed for many of the mental illnesses identi-fied in the DSM-5 (APA, 2013). These skills may be applied in any setting where nursing is practiced. A case study situation of nursing care at the sec- ondary level of prevention in a community setting ispresented in Box 36-1. Tertiary Prevention Individuals With Severe and Persistent Mental Illness Severe and persistent mental illness is characterizedby a functional impairment that interferes with vocational capacity, creates serious interpersonaldifficulties, or is associated with a suicide plan or attempt (Jans, Stoddard, & Kraus, 2004). These disorders are identified by criteria listed in the DSM-5. Diagnoses include schizophrenia and re- lated disorders, bipolar disorder, autism spectrumdisorder, major depressive disorder, panic disorder,obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Jans et al., 2004; National Alliance on Mental Illness [NAMI], 2012).Severe and persistent mental disorders affect 5 to10 million adults and 3 to 5 million children in theUnited States. BOX 36-1 Secondary Prevention Case Study: Parenthood The identified patient was a petite, doll-like 4-year-old girl named Tanya. She was the older of two children in a LatinoAmerican family. The other child was a boy named Joseph,aged 2. The mother was 5 months pregnant with their thirdchild. The family had been referred to the nurse after Tanyawas placed in foster care following a report to the Depart-ment of Health and Human Services by her nursery schoolteacher that the child had marks on her body suspicious ofchild abuse. The parents, Paulo and Annette, were in their mid-20s. Paulo had lost his job at an aircraft plant 3 months ago andhad been unable to find work since. Annette brought in afew dollars from cleaning houses for other people, but thefamily was struggling to survive. Paulo and Annette were angry at having to see the nurse. After all, \"Parents have the right to discipline their children.\"The nurse did not focus on the intent of the behavior, but instead looked at factors in the family's life that could beviewed as stressors. This family had multiple stressors:poverty, the father's unemployment, the age and spacing ofthe children, the mother's chronic fatigue from work at homeand in other people's homes, and finally, having a child removed from the home against the parents' wishes. During therapy with this family, the nurse discussed the behaviors associated with various developmental levels. Shealso discussed possible deviations from these norms andwhen they should be reported to the physician. The nurseand the family discussed Tanya's behavior, and how it com-pared with the norms. The parents also discussed their own childhoods. They were able to relate some of the same types of behaviorsthat they observed in Tanya. But they both admitted thatthey came from families whose main method of disciplinewas physical punishment. Annette had been the oldest childin her large family and had been expected to \"keep theyounger ones in line.\" When she had not done so, she waspunished with her father's belt. She expressed anger towardher father, although she had never been allowed to expressit at the time.Paulo's father had died when he was a small boy, and Paulo had been expected to be the \"man of the family.\" Fromthe time he was very young, he worked at odd jobs to bringmoney into the home. Because of this, he had little time forthe usual activities of childhood and adolescence. He heldmuch resentment toward the young men who \"had every-thing and never had to work for it.\" Paulo and Annette had high expectations for Tanya. In ef- fect, they expected her to behave in a manner well beyondher developmental level. These expectations were based onthe reflections of their own childhoods. They were uncom-fortable with the spontaneity and playfulness of childhoodbecause they had had little personal experience with thesebehaviors. When Tanya balked and expressed the verbal as-sertions common to early childhood, Paulo and Annette in-terpreted these behaviors as defiance toward them andretaliated with anger in the manner in which they had beenparented. With the parents, the nurse explored feelings and behav- iors from their past so that they were able to understand thecorrelation to their current behaviors. They learned to nego-tiate ways to deal with Tanya's age-appropriate behaviors. Incombined therapy with Tanya, they learned how to relate toher childishness, and even how to enjoy playing with bothof their children. The parents ceased blaming each other for the family's problems. Annette had spent a good deal of her time dep-recating Paulo for his lack of support of his family, and Pauloblamed Annette for being \"unable to control her daughter.\"Communication patterns were clarified, and life in the familybecame more peaceful. Without a need to \"prove himself\" to his wife, Paulo's ef- forts to find employment met with success because he nolonger felt the need to turn down jobs that he believed hiswife would perceive to be beneath his capabilities. Annetteno longer works outside the home, and both she and Pauloparticipate in the parenting chores. Tanya and her siblingscontinue to demonstrate age-appropriate developmentalprogression.4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:51 PM Page 811Historical and Epidemiological Aspects In 1955, more than half a million individuals resided in public mental hospitals. Estimates suggest that thisnumber is fewer than 100,000 today. Deinstitutionalization of persons with serious men- tal illness began in the 1960s as national policychange and with a strong belief in the individual'sright to freedom. Other considerations included thedeplorable conditions of some of the state asylums,the introduction of psychotropic medications, andthe cost-effectiveness of caring for these individualsin the community setting. Deinstitutionalization began to occur rapidly and without sufficient planning for the needs of these in-dividuals as they reentered the community. Thosewho were fortunate enough to have support systemsto provide assistance with living arrangements andsheltered employment experiences most often re-ceived the outpatient treatment they required. Thosewithout adequate support, however, either managedto survive on a meager existence or were forced tojoin the ranks of the homeless. Some ended up innursing homes meant to provide care for individualswith physical disabilities. Certain segments of our population with severe and persistent mental illness have been left untreated:the elderly, the \"working poor,\" the homeless, andthose individuals previously covered by funds thathave been cut by various social reforms. These circumstances have promoted in individuals with se-vere and persistent mental illness a greater numberof crisis-oriented emergency department visits andhospital admissions, and repeated confrontationswith law enforcement officials. In 2002, President George W. Bush established the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health. Thiscommission was charged with the task of conductinga comprehensive study of the United States mentalhealth service delivery system. They were to identifyunmet needs and barriers to services and recommendsteps for improvement in services and support for in-dividuals with serious mental illness. In July 2003, thecommission presented its final report to the President(President's New Freedom Commission on MentalHealth, 2003). The Commission identified the follow-ing five barriers: 1. Fragmentation and gaps in care for children. About 7 to 9 percent of all children (ages 9 to17) have a serious emotional disturbance (SED).The Commission found that services for childrenare even more fragmented than those for adults,with more uncoordinated funding and differingeligibility requirements. Only a fraction of chil-dren with SED appear to have access to school-based or school-linked mental health ser vices. Children with SED who are identified for specialeducation services have higher levels of absen-teeism, higher drop-out rates, and lower levels ofacademic achievement than students with otherdisabilities. 2. Fragmentation and gaps in care for adults with se- rious mental illness. The commission expressed concern that so many adults with serious mentalillness are homeless, dependent on alcohol ordrugs, unemployed, and go without treatment. According to the W orld Health Organization (WHO), neuropsychiatric conditions account for13 percent of the total Disability Adjusted LifeYears (DALYs) lost due to all disease and injuriesin the world, and are expected to increase by 15percent by the year 2020 (WHO, 2004). The Com-mission identified public attitudes and the stigmaassociated with mental illness as major barriers totreatment. Stigma is often internalized by individualswith mental illness, leading to hopelessness, lowerself-esteem, and isolation. Stigma deprives these in-dividuals of the support they need to recover. 3. High unemployment and disability for people with serious mental illness. Undetected, untreated, and poorly treated mental disorders interrupt careers,leading many individuals into lives of disability, poverty , and long-term dependence. The commis- sion found a 90 percent unemployment rateamong adults with serious mental illness\u2014theworst level of employment of any group of peoplewith disabilities. Some surveys have shown thatmany individuals with serious mental illness want to work, and could, with modest assistance. How-ever, the largest \"program\" of assistance theUnited States has for people with mental illness isdisability payments. Sadly, societal stigma is also re-flected in employment discrimination against peo-ple with mental illness. 4. Older adults with mental illnesses are not receiving care . The commission reported that about 5 to 10 percent of older adults have major depression,yet most are not properly recognized and treated.The report stated: Older people are reluctant to get care from spe- cialists. They feel more comfortable going to theirprimary care physician. Still, they are often more sensitive to the stigma of mental illness, and do notreadily bring up their sadness and despair . If they acknowledge problems, they are more likely thanyoung people to describe physical symptoms. Pri-mary care doctors may see their suffering as \"nat-ural\" aging, or treat their reported physical distressinstead of the underlying mental disorder. What isoften missed is the deep impact of depression onolder people's capacity to function in ways that areseemingly effortless for others.812 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:51 PM Page 812CHAPTER 36 Community Mental Health Nursing 813 5. Mental health and suicide prevention are not yet national priorities. The fact that the United States has failed to prioritize mental health puts many lives at stake. Families struggle to maintain equilib-rium while communities strain (and often fail) toprovide needed assistance for adults and childrenwho suffer from mental illness. Over 30,000 livesare lost annually to suicide. About 90 percent ofthose who take their life have a mental disorder. Many individuals who commit suicide have not hadthe care in the months before their death thatwould help them to affirm life. Both the AmericanPsychiatric Association and the National MentalHealth Association have called on the U.S. Con-gress to pass parity legislation. Lack of equal accessto insurance coverage is conspicuous evidence ofthe low priority placed on mental health treatment. The Commission outlined the following goals and recommendations for mental health reform: Goal 1. Americans will understand that mental health is essential to overall health. Commission recommendations: Advance and implement a national campaign toreduce the stigma of seeking care and a nationalstrategy for suicide prevention. Address mental health with the same urgency asphysical health. Goal 2. Mental health care will be consumer and family driven. Commission recommendations: Develop an individualized plan of care for everyadult with a serious mental illness and child witha serious emotional disturbance. Involve consumers and families fully in orientingthe mental health system toward recovery. Align relevant federal programs to improve ac-cess and accountability for mental health services. Create a comprehensive state mental health plan. Protect and enhance the rights of people withmental illness. Goal 3. Disparities in mental health services will be eliminated. Commission recommendations: Improve access to quality care that is culturallycompetent. Improve access to quality care in rural and geo-graphically remote areas. Goal 4. Early mental health screening, assessment, and referral to services will be common practice. Commission recommendations: Promote the mental health of young children. Improve and expand school mental health programs.Screen for co-occurring mental and substanceuse disorders and link with integrated treatmentstrategies. Screen for mental disorders in primary healthcare, across the life span, and connect to treat-ment and supports. Goal 5. Excellent mental health care will be deliv- ered and research will be accelerated. Commission recommendations: Accelerate research to promote recovery and resilience, and ultimately to cure and preventmental illnesses. Advance evidence-based practices using dissem-ination and demonstration projects, and createa public-private partnership to guide their imple-mentation. Improve and expand the workforce providing ev-idence-based mental health services and supports. Develop the knowledge base in four understud-ied areas: mental health disparities, long-term ef-fects of medications, trauma, and acute care. Goal 6. Technology will be used to access mental health care and information. Commission recommendations: Use health technology and telehealth to improveaccess and coordination of mental health care,especially for Americans in remote areas or inunderserved populations. Develop and implement integrated electronichealth record and personal health informationsystems. Since the release of this report, a number of organ- izations have released plans for implementing someof these recommendations. Von Esenwein and asso-ciates (2005) conducted a follow-up survey of organ-izations represented at the 19th annual RosalynnCarter Symposium on Mental Health Policy (whichwas held in 2003 just following release of the report).In this survey, nearly half of the respondents reportedthat at least one change had been made in their or-ganization in response to the commission's report.Von Esenwein and associates (2005) reported: Factors most consistently identified as contributing to successful implementation of the recommenda-tions of the New Freedom Commission were willing-ness to change within the organization, partnershipswith community agencies, and availability of publicfunding. The most common barriers cited were fi-nancial constraints, other competing priorities withinthe organization, and lack of local political support.(p. 606) The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), in collaboration with a number of other federal agencies, has outlined a plan4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:51 PM Page 813to implement the New Freedom Commission's pro- posals. They have stated, \"This Federal Mental Health Action Agenda represents the first 'to do list' of a multi- year effort to alter the form and function of the men-tal health system from the top down and from thebottom up\" (SAMHSA, 2009). This report delineatesa number of principles and action items designed to \"help adults with serious mental illnesses and children with serious emotional disturbances achieverecovery to live, work, learn, and participate fully intheir communities.\" If the proposals outlined by the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health becamereality, it would surely mean improvement in the careof individuals with severe and persistent mental ill-ness. Many nurse leaders see this period of health-care reform as an opportunity for nurses to expandtheir roles and assume key positions in education,prevention, assessment, and referral. Nurses are, andwill continue to be, in key positions to assist individu-als with severe and persistent mental illness to remainas independent as possible, to manage their illnesswithin the community setting, and to strive to mini-mize the number of hospitalizations required. Treatment Alternatives Community Mental Health Centers The goal of commu- nity mental health centers in caring for individuals withsevere and persistent mental illness is to improve cop-ing ability and prevent exacerbation of acute symp-toms. A major obstacle in meeting this goal has beenthe lack of advocacy or sponsorship for clients who re-quire services from a variety of sources. This has placed responsibility for health care on an individual withmental illness who is often barely able to cope withever yday life. Case management (which was discussed in Chapter 9 of this text) has become a recommendedmethod of treatment for individuals with severe andpersistent mental illness. Ling and Ruscin (2013) state: Nurses may be uniquely qualified to be case man- agers because of their holistic and broad-based back-ground, understanding of health care, and role inpatient education and referrals. Case management isan area of practice that offers nurses an opportunityto build on their clinical knowledge, communication,and nursing process skills to function in an expandedpatient care role. Ling and Ruscin (2013) identify six essential ac- tivities and nursing role functions that blend with the steps of the nursing process to form a frameworkfor nursing case management. The essential activi-ties include: Assessment .During the assessment process, the nurse gathers pertinent information about a client'ssituation and ability to function. Information maybe obtained through physical examination, clientinterview, medical records, and reports from signif-icant others. Ling and Ruscin state, \"The case man-ager's goal is to obtain accurate information aboutthe patient's status and identify factors that may sig-nificantly affect the patient's recovery and care.\" Planning .A service care plan is devised with client participation. The plan should include mutuallyagreed-on goals, specific actions directed towardgoal achievement, and selection of essential re-sources and services through collaboration amonghealth care professionals, the client, and the familyor significant others. Implementation .In this phase, the client receives the needed services from the appropriate providers.In some instances the nursing case manager is also a provider of care, whereas in others, he or she isonly the coordinator of care. Coordination. The case manager organizes, se- cures, integrates, and modifies the resources nec-essary to accomplish the case management goals(Case Management Society of America [CMSA],2010). This coordination effort involves the client,the physician, any other pertinent health-careproviders, and family members or significant oth-ers concerned with the client's care. The case man-ager ensures that all tests and treatments areconducted according to schedule, and maintainsclose communication with all health-care providersto ensure that client care is proceeding accordingto the plan. Monitoring. The case manager monitors the effec- tiveness of the care plan by gathering pertinent in-formation from various sources at regular intervalsto determine the client's response and progress(CMSA, 2010). If problems are identified, immedi-ate adjustments are made. Evaluation. The case manager evaluates the client's responses to interventions and progress towardpreestablished goals. Regular contact is maintainedwith client, family or significant others, and directservice providers. Ongoing coordination of care con-tinues until outcomes have been achieved. If the ex-pected outcomes are not achieved, the case managerreevaluates the plan to determine the reason, andtakes steps to intervene and modify the existing plan. A case study of nursing case management within a community mental health center is presented in Box 36-2. Program of Assertive Community Treatment (PACT) NAMI (2013) defines PACT as a ser vice-delivery model that provides comprehensive, locally based treatment to people with serious and persistent mental illnesses.PACT is a type of case-management program that provides highly individualized services directly to 814 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:51 PM Page 814CHAPTER 36 Community Mental Health Nursing 815 consumers. It is a team approach, and includes mem- bers from psychiatry, social work, nursing, and sub-stance abuse and vocational rehabilitation. The PACTteam provides these services 24 hours a day, 7 days aweek, 365 days a year. NAMI (2013) identifies the primary goals of PACT as follows: To lessen or eliminate the debilitating symptoms ofmental illness each individual client experiences To minimize or prevent recurrent acute episodesof the illness To meet basic needs and enhance quality of life To improve functioning in adult social and employ-ment roles To enhance an individual's ability to live independ-ently in his or her own community To lessen the family's burden of providing care The PACT team provides treatment, rehabilitation, and support services to individuals with severe and per-sistent mental illness who are unable on their own toreceive treatment from a traditional model of casemanagement. The team is usually able to provide mostservices with minimal referrals to other mental healthprograms or providers. Services are provided withincommunity settings, such as a person's home, localrestaurants, parks, nearby stores, and any other placethat the individual requires assistance with living skills. Studies have shown that PACT clients spend sig- nificantly less time in hospitals and more time in independent living situations, have less time unem-ployed, earn more income from competitive employ-ment, experience more positive social relationships,express greater satisfaction with life, and are lesssymptomatic (NAMI, 2013). Only about half of thestates currently have PACT programs established orunder pilot testing. NAMI (2013) states: Despite the documented treatment success of PACT, only a fraction of those with the greatest needs have ac-cess to this uniquely effective program. In the UnitedStates, adults with severe and persistent mental illnessesconstitute one-half to 1 percent of the adult popula-tion. It is estimated that 10 to 20 percent of this groupcould be helped by the PACT model if it were available. Day-Evening Treatment/Partial Hospitalization Programs Day or evening treatment programs (also called partial hospitalization) are designed to prevent BOX 36-2 Nursing Case Management in the Community Mental Health Center: A Case Study Michael, 73 years old with a history of multiple psychiatric admissions, has lived in various adult foster homes andboarding houses for the past 10 years. He was originally diagnosed as having schizophrenia, but he was recently rediagnosed as having bipolar I disorder. His symptoms arewell controlled with lithium 300 mg three times a day, whichis prescribed by the outpatient psychiatrist. The nurse practitioner/case manager in the outpatient clinic coordinates Michael's care, advocates for his needs,and counsels him regarding his health problems, She ordersroutine blood tests to assess his lithium levels. When Michaelexperienced visual disturbances, she referred him for anemergency eye evaluation. He was found to have a retinaldetachment and was sent to a local Veteran's Administration(VA) hospital for emergency surgery. After his eye surgery,the nurse practitioner arranged transportation to his follow-up visits with the eye doctor and instructed him about hiseye care and instillation of his eye drops. Michael did not likeputting eye drops in his eye and tended to neglect doing it.Because he also had glaucoma and required ongoing treat-ment with pilocarpine and timolol maleate eye drops twicedaily, he needed a great deal of education and reassuranceto continue using the eye drops. In addition to routine quarterly visits for ongoing case management, the nurse practitioner also performs his annual health assessment consisting of history, review ofsystems, mental status exam, and physical assessment.During Michael's last physical exam, the nurse practitionerdetected a thyroid mass and referred him for a completeevaluation including thyroid function tests, a thyroid scan,and evaluation by a surgeon and an endocrinologist. Shediscussed his thyroid problem with the surgeon and the en-docrinologist, and they determined that Michael would bestbenefit from thyroid replacement (i.e., levothyroxinesodium 0.1 mg daily). Because Michael eats all of his meals in restaurants, the nurse was concerned about his diet. A brief diet review re-vealed that his diet was low in vitamin C. He was then in-structed in which foods and juices he should include in hisdaily menu. The nurse practitioner discussed ways thatMichael could get the best nutrition for the least cost. Michael currently is living in a boarding house and is totally responsible for taking his own medication, attending to hisactivities of daily living, and managing his own money. Hehas very limited income and depends on donations for manyof his clothing needs. Despite his age, he is quite active and alert. He attends many VA-sponsored social activities and does daily volunteerwork at the VA, such as pushing wheelchairs, running er-rands, and escorting other veterans to clinic appointments.His nurse case manager arranged for him to receive freelunches as a reward for some of his volunteer activities. Nursing case management has helped this elderly gentle- man with severe and persistent psychiatric illness and manyyears of hospitalization to live independently within the com-munity setting.

Varioustypes of treatment are offered. Many include thera-peutic community (milieu) activities; individual,group, therapy.Many programs offer medication administration andmonitoring as part of their care. Some programs haveestablished medication clinics for individuals on long-term psychopharmacological therapy. These clinicsmay include educational classes and support groupsfor individuals with similar conditions and treatments. Partial hospitalization programs generally offer a comprehensive treatment plan formulated by an inter-disciplinary team of psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses,occupational and recreational therapists, and socialworkers. Nurses take a leading role in the administra-tion of partial hospitalization programs. They leadgroups, provide crisis intervention, conduct individualcounseling, act as role models, and make necessary re-ferrals for specialized treatment. Use of the nursingprocess provides continual evaluation of the program,and modifications can be made as necessary. Partial hospitalization programs have proven to be an effective method of preventing hospitalization formany individuals with severe and persistent mental ill-ness. They are a way of transitioning these individualsfrom the acute care setting back into the mainstreamof the community. For some individuals who havebeen deinstitutionalized, they provide structure, sup-port, opportunities for socialization, and an improve-ment in their overall quality of life. Community Residential Facilities Community residen- tial facilities for persons with severe and persistent mental illness are known by many names: grouphomes, halfway houses, foster homes, boardinghomes, sheltered care facilities, transitional housing,independent living programs, social rehabilitationresidences, and others. These facilities differ by thepurpose for which they exist and the activities thatthey offer. Some of these facilities provide food, shelter , housekeeping, and minimal supervision and assis-tance with activities of daily living. Others may also in-clude a variety of therapies and serve as a transitionbetween hospital and independent living. In additionto the basics, services might include individual andgroup counseling, medical care, job training or em-ployment assistance, and leisure-time activities. A wide variety of personnel staff these facilities. Some facilities have live-in professionals who are avail-able at all times, some have professional staff who areon call for intervention during crisis situations, andsome are staffed by volunteers and individuals withlittle knowledge or background for understandingand treating persons with severe and persistent men-tal illness. The concept of transitional housing for individu- als with serious mental illness is sound and hasproved in many instances to be a successful means oftherapeutic support and intervention for maintain-ing them within the community. However, withoutguidance and planning, transition to the communitycan be futile. These individuals may be ridiculed andrejected by the community. They may be targets ofunscrupulous individuals who take advantage of theirinability to care for themselves satisfactorily. Thesebehaviors may increase maladaptive responses to thedemands of community living and exacerbate themental illness. A period of structured reorientationto the community in a living situation that is super-vised and monitored by professionals is more likelyto result in a successful transition for the individualwith severe and persistent mental illness. Psychiatric Home Health Care For the individual with serious mental illness who no longer lives in a struc- tured, superv ised setting, home health care may be the element that helps to keep him or her living independently. To receive home health care, individ-uals must validate their homebound status for theprospective payer (Medicare, Medicaid, most insur-ance companies, and Department of Veterans Affairs[VA] benefits). An acute psychiatric diagnosis is notenough to qualify for the service. The client mustshow that he or she is unable to leave the home with-out considerable difficulty or the assistance of an-other person. The plan of treatment and subsequentcharting must explain why the client's psychiatric dis-order keeps him or her at home and justify the needfor home services. Homebound clients most often have a diagnosis of depressive disorder, neurocognitive disorder, anx-iety disorder, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia.Many elderly clients are homebound because of med-ical conditions that impair mobility and necessitatehome care. Nurses who provide psychiatric home care must have an in-depth knowledge of psychopathology, psy-chopharmacology, and how medical and physicalproblems can be influenced by psychiatric impair-ments. These nurses must be highly adept at perform-ing biopsychosocial assessments. They must besensitive to changes in behavior that signal that theclient is decompensating psychiatrically or medicallyso that early intervention may be implemented. Another important job of the psychiatric home health nurse is monitoring the client's adherence tothe regimen of psychotropic medications. Someclients who are receiving injectable medications 816 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:51 PM Page 816CHAPTER 36 Community Mental Health Nursing 817 remain on home health care only until they can be placed on oral medications. Those clients receivingoral medications require close monitoring for adher-ence and assistance with the uncomfortable side ef-fects of some of these drugs. Lack of adherence to themedication regimen is responsible for approximatelytwo-thirds of psychiatric hospital readmissions. Homehealth nurses can assist clients with this problem byhelping them to see the relationship between controlof their psychiatric symptoms and adherence to theirmedication regimen. Client populations that benefit from psychiatric home health nursing include: Elderly clients. These individuals may not have a psychiatric diagnosis, but they may be experiencingemotional difficulties that have arisen from medical,sociocultural, or developmental factors. Depressedmood and social isolation are common. Persons with severe and persistent mental illness.These individuals have a history of psychiatric ill-ness and hospitalization. They require long-termmedications and continual supportive care. Com-mon diagnoses include recurrent major depressivedisorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Individuals in acute crisis situations .These individ- uals are in need of crisis intervention and/or short-term psychotherapy. The American Nurses Association (ANA) (2008) defines home health nursing as: . . . nursing practice applied to patients of all ages in the patient's residences, which may include privatehomes, assisted living, or personal care facilities. Patients and their families and other caregivers arethe focus of home health nursing practice. The goalof care is to maintain or improve the quality of lifefor patients and their families and other caregivers,or to support patients in their transition to end of life. (p. 3) Medicare requires that psychiatric home nursing care be provided by \"psychiatrically trained nurses,\" which they define as, \". . . nurses who have specialtraining and/or experience beyond the standard cur-riculum required for a registered nurse\" (Centers forMedicare & Medicaid Services [CMS], 2011). The guidelines that cover psychiatric nursing serv- ices are not well defined by the CMS. This has pre-sented some reimbursement problems for psychiatricnurses in the past. The CMS statement regarding psy-chiatric nursing services is presented in Box 36-3. Preparation for psychiatric home health nursing, in addition to the registered nurse licensure, shouldinclude several years of psychiatric inpatient treatmentexperience. It is also recommended that the nursehave medical-surgical nursing experience, because ofcommon client physical co-morbidity and the holisticnursing perspective. Additional training and experi-ence in psychotherapy is viewed as an asset. However,psychotherapy is not the primary focus of psychiatrichome nursing care. In fact, most reimbursementsources do not pay for exclusively insight-orientedtherapy. Crisis intervention, client education, andhands-on care are common interventions in psychi-atric home nursing care. The psychiatric home health nurse provides com- prehensive nursing care, incorporating interventionsfor physical and psychosocial problems into the treat-ment plan. The interventions are based on theclient's mental and physical health status, cultural in-fluences, and available resources. The nurse is ac-countable to the client at all times during thetherapeutic relationship. Nursing interventions arecarried out with appropriate knowledge and skill, andreferrals are made when the need is outside the scopeof nursing practice. Continued collaboration withother members of the health-care team (e.g., psychi-atrist, social worker, psychologist, occupational ther-apist, and/or physical therapist) is essential formaintaining continuity of care. A case study of psychiatric home health care and the nursing process is presented in Box 36-4. A planof care for Mrs. C (the client in the case study) is pre-sented in Table 36-2. Nursing diagnoses are presented,along with outcome criteria, appropriate nursing in-terventions, and rationale for each. Care for the Caregivers Another aspect of psychiatric home health care is to provide support and assistance to primary caregivers. When family is the provider of care on a 7-day-a-week, 24-hour -a-day schedule for a loved one with a severe and persistent mental disorder,BOX 36-3 CMS Guidelines for Psychiatric Home Nursing Care PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION, THERAPY, AND TEACHINGThe evaluation, psychotherapy, and teaching needed by apatient suffering from a diagnosed psychiatric disorder thatrequires active treatment by a psychiatrically trained nurseand the costs of the psychiatric nurse's services may becovered as a skilled nursing service. Psychiatrically trainednurses are nurses who have special training and/or expe-rience beyond the standard curriculum required for a reg-istered nurse. T he services of the psychiatric nurse are to be provided under a plan of care established and reviewedby a physician. From Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. (2011).

Mrs. C had been an elemen- tary school teacher for 40 years, retiring at age 65 with anadequate pension. She and her husband had no children. Aniece looks in on Mrs. C regularly. It was she who contactedMrs. C's physician when she observed that Mrs. C was noteating properly, was losing weight, and seemed to be isolat-ing herself more and more. She had not left her apartmentin weeks. Her physician referred her to psychiatric homehealth care. On her initial visit, Carol, the psychiatric home health nurse, conducted a preliminary assessment revealing the followinginformation about Mrs. C: 1. Blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg. 2. Height 5 5; weight 102 lb. 3. Poor skin turgor; dehydration. 4. Subjective report of occasional dizziness. 5. Subjective report of loss of 20 pounds since the death of her husband. 6. Oriented to time, place, person, and situation. 7. Memory (remote and recent) intact. 8. Flat affect. 9. Mood is dysphoric and tearful at times, but client is cooperative. 10. Denies thoughts to harm self, but states, \"I feel so alone; so useless.\" 11. Subjective report of difficulty sleeping.12. Subjective report of constipation. DIAGNOSIS/OUTCOME IDENTIFICATION The following nursing diagnoses were formulated for Mrs. C: 1. Complicated grieving related to death of husband evi- denced by symptoms of depression such as withdrawal, anorexia, weight loss, difficulty sleeping, dysphoric/tearfulmood. 2. Risk for injury related to dizziness and weakness from lack of activity, low blood pressure, and poor nutritional status. 3. Social isolation related to depressed mood and feelings of worthlessness, evidenced by staying home alone, refusing to leave her apartment. Outcome Criteria The following criteria were selected as measurement of out-comes in the care of Mrs. C: 1. Experiences no physical harm/injury. 2. Is able to discuss feelings about husband's death with nurse. 3. Sets realistic goals for self. 4. Is able to participate in problem solving regarding her future. 5. Eats a well-balanced diet with snacks to restore nutri- tional status and gain weight. 6. Drinks adequate fluid daily. 7. Sleeps at least 6 hours per night and verbalizes feeling well rested. 8. Shows interest in personal appearance and hygiene, and is able to accomplish self-care independently. 9. Seeks to renew contact with previous friends and acquaintances. 10. Verbalizes interest in participating in social activities. PLAN/IMPLEMENTATION A plan of care for Mrs. C is presented in Table 36-2. EVALUATION Mrs. C started the second week taking trazodone (Desyrel)15 0 mg at bedtime. Her sleep was enhanced and within 2 weeks she showed a noticeable improvement in mood.She began to discuss how angry she felt about being allalone in the world. She admitted that she had felt anger toward her husband but experienced guilt and tried to sup-press that anger. As she was assured that these feelings werenormal, they became easier for her to express. The nurse arranged for a local teenager to do some weekly grocery shopping for Mrs. C and contacted the local Mealson Wheels program, which delivered her noon meal to herevery day. Mrs. C began to eat more and slowly to gain a fewpounds. She still has an occasional problem with constipationbut verbalizes improvement with the addition of vegetables,fruit, and a daily stool softener prescribed by her physician. Mrs. C used her walker until she felt she was able to am- bulate without assistance. She reports that she no longer ex-periences dizziness, and her blood pressure has stabilized ataround 100/70 mm Hg. Mrs. C has joined a senior citizens group and attends ac- tivities weekly. She has renewed previous friendships andformed new acquaintances. She sees her physician monthlyfor medication management and visits a local adult dayhealth center for regular blood pressure and weight checks.Her niece still visits regularly, but her favorite relationship isthe one she has formed with her constant canine compan-ion, Molly, whom Mrs. C rescued from the local animal shel-ter and who continually demonstrates her unconditional loveand gratitude.4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:51 PM Page 818CHAPTER 36 Community Mental Health Nursing 819 Table 36-2 | CARE PLAN FOR PSYCHIATRIC HOME HEALTH CARE OF DEPRESSED ELDERLY (MRS.

A care plan for primary caregivers is presented in Table 36-3. The Homeless Population Historical and Epidemiological Aspects In 1993, Dr. Richard Lamb, a recognized expert inthe field of severe and persistent mental illness, wrote: Alec Guinness, in his memorable role as a British Army colonel in Bridge on the River Kwai, exclaims atthe end of the film when he finally realizes he hasbeen working to help the enemy, \"What have I done?\"As a vocal advocate and spokesman for deinstitution-alization and community treatment of severely men-tally ill patients for well over two decades, I often findmyself asking that same question (p. 1209). The number of homeless in the United States has been estimated at somewhere between 250,000 and 4 million. It is difficult to determine the true scope ofthe problem because even the statisticians who collect Table 36-3 | CARE PLAN FOR PRIMARY CAREGIVER OF CLIENT WITH SEVERE AND PERSISTENT MENTAL ILLNESS NURSING DIAGNOSIS: CAREGIVER ROLE STRAIN RELATED TO: Severity and dur ation of the care receiver's illness and lack of respite and recreation for the caregiver EVIDENCED BY: Feelings of stress in relationship with care receiver, feelings of depression and anger, family conflict around issues of providing care OUTCOME CRITERIA NURSING INTERVENTIONS RATIONALE Short-Term Goal \u0081 Caregivers will verbalize understanding of ways to facilitate the caregiver role.

They have sometimes been identified as, \"those people who sleep in shelters or public spaces.\" Thisapproach results in underestimates because availableshelter services are insufficient to meet the numbersof homeless people (U.S. Conference of Mayors[USCM], 2012). According to the Stewart B. McKinney Act, a per- son is considered homeless who: lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate night-time resi- is: (A) a supervised publicly or privately operatedshelter designed to provide temporary living accom-modations, (B) an institution that provides a tempo-rary residence for individuals intended to beinstitutionalized, or (C) a public or private place notdesigned for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleepingaccommodation for human beings. (National Coalitionfor the Homeless [NCH], 2009d) Two methods of counting the homeless are com- monly used (NCH, 2009c). The point-in-time method attempts to count all the people who are literally homeless on a given day or during a given week. Thesecond method (called period prevalence counts ) exam- ines the number of people who are homeless over agiven period of time. This second method may resultin a more accurate count because the extended timeperiod would allow for including the people who arehomeless one day (or week) but find employmentand affordable housing later, removing them fromthe homeless count. At the same time during this extended period, others would lose housing and be-come homeless. Who Are the Homeless? The homeless are increasingly a heterogeneousgroup. The NCH (2009d) provided the following de-mographics: Age Studies have produced a variety of statistics re- lated to age of the homeless: 39 percent are youngerthan 18 years of age; individuals between the ages of25 and 34 make up 25 percent; and 6 percent are ages55 to 64. Gender Statistics for 2010 indicated that 62 percent of homeless individuals were male and 38 percentwere female (SAMHSA, 2011). Families Families with children are among the fastest growing segments of the homeless population. They make up 23 percent of the homeless population, butresearch indicates that this number is higher in ruralareas, where families, single mothers, and children ac-count for the largest group of homeless people. Ethnicity The homeless population is estimated to be 37 percent African American, 41 percent Caucasian,10 percent Hispanic, 5 percent of other single races,and 7 percent of multiple races (SAMHSA, 2011).The ethnic makeup of homeless populations variesaccording to geographic location. Mental Illness and Homelessness The USCM (2012) survey revealed that approximately30 percent of the homeless population suffers fromsome form of mental illness. Who are these individu-als, and why are they homeless? Some blame the de-institutionalization movement. Persons with mentalillness who were released from state and county men-tal hospitals and who did not have families with whomthey could reside sought residence in board-and-carehomes of varying quality. Halfway houses and support-ive group living arrangements were helpful butscarce. Many of those with families returned to theirhomes, but because families received little if any instruction or support, the consequences of theirmentally ill loved one returning to live at home wereoften turbulent, resulting in the individual frequentlyleaving home. Types of Mental Illness Among the Homeless A number of studies have been conducted, primarily in large,urban areas, that have addressed the most commontypes of mental illness identified among homeless in-dividuals. Schizophrenia is frequently described as themost common diagnosis. Other prevalent disordersinclude bipolar disorder, substance addiction, depres- sion, personality disorders, and neurocognitive disor - ders. Many exhibit psychotic symptoms, many areformer residents of long-term care institutions for thementally ill, and many have such a strong desire forindependence that they isolate themselves in an effortto avoid being identified as a part of the mentalhealth system. Many of them are clearly a danger tothemselves or others, yet they often do not even seethemselves as ill. Contributing Factors to Homelessness Among Individuals With Mental Illness Deinstitutionalization As previously stated, deinstitu- tionalization is frequently implicated as a contribut- ing factor to homelessness among individuals withmental illness. Deinstitutionalization began out of ex-pressed concern by mental health professionals andothers who described the \"deplorable conditions\"under which mentally ill individuals were housed. The advent of psychotropic medications and the community mental health movement began a grow-ing philosophical view that individuals with mental ill-ness receive better and more humanitarian treatmentin the community than in state hospitals far removedfrom their homes. It was believed that commitmentand institutionalization in many ways deprived theseindividuals of their civil rights. Not the least of 822 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:52 PM Page 822the motivating factors for deinstitutionalization was the financial burden these clients placed on state governments. In fact, deinstitutionalization has not failed com- pletely. About 50 percent of the mentally ill population\u2014those who have insight into their illness and need formedication\u2014have done reasonably well. It is individ-uals from the other 50 percent, those who lack suchinsight and who frequently stop taking their medica-tion, that often end up on the streets. However, because the vast increases in homeless- ness did not occur until the 1980s, the release of se-verely mentally ill people from institutions cannot besolely to blame. A number of other factors have beenimplicated. Poverty Cuts in various government entitlement pro- grams have depleted the allotments available for in-dividuals with severe and persistent mental illnessliving in the community. The job market is prohibitive for individuals whose behavior is incomprehensibleor even frightening to many . The stigma and discrim- ination associated with mental illness may be dimin-ishing slowly, but it is highly visible to those who sufferfrom its effects. A Scarcity of Affordable Housing The National Coalition for the Homeless (NCH, 2009e) states: A lack of affordable housing and the limited scale of housing assistance programs have contributed to thecurrent housing crisis and to homelessness. The lackof affordable housing has led to high rent burdens(rents which absorb a high proportion of income),overcrowding, and substandard housing. These phe-nomena, in turn, have not only forced many peopleto become homeless; they have put a large and grow-ing number of people at risk of becoming homeless.Recently, [a rise in the percentage of housing] fore-closures has increased the number of people who experience homelessness. In addition, the number of single-room-occupancy (SRO) hotels has diminished drastically. These SRO hotels provided a means of relatively inexpensivehousing, and although some people believe that thesefacilities nurtured isolation, they provided adequateshelter from the elements for their occupants. Somany individuals currently frequent the shelters ofour cities that there is concern that the shelters arebecoming mini-institutions for individuals with seri-ous mental illness. Other Factors Several other factors that may con- tribute to homelessness have been identified (NCH,2009e). They include the following: Lack of affordable health care. For families barely able to scrape together enough money to pay forday-to-day living, a catastrophic illness can createthe level of poverty that starts the downward spiralto homelessness. Domestic Violence. The NCH (2009e) reports that domestic violence is a primary cause of homeless-ness, with approximately 63 percent of homelesswomen having experienced domestic violence intheir adult lives. Battered women are often forcedto choose between an abusive relationship andhomelessness. Addiction Disorders. For individuals with alcohol or drug addictions, in the absence of appropriatetreatment, the chances increase for being forcedinto life on the street. The following have beencited as obstacles to addiction treatment for home-less persons: lack of health insurance, lack of documentation, waiting lists, scheduling difficulties,daily contact requirements, lack of transportation,ineffective treatment methods, lack of supportiveservices, and cultural insensitivity. Community Resources for the Homeless Interfering Factors Among the many issues that com- plicate service planning for homeless individuals with mental illness is this population's penchant formobility. Frequent relocation confounds service de-livery and interferes with providers' efforts to ensureappropriate care. Some individuals with serious men-tal illness may be affected by homelessness only tem-porarily or intermittently. These individuals aresometimes called the \"episodically homeless.\" Othersmove around within neighborhoods or cities as needschange and based on whether or not they can obtainneeded services. A large number of the homeless mentally ill population exhibits continuous un-bounded movement over wide geographical areas. Not all homeless individuals with mental illness are mobile. Some studies have indicated that a large per-centage remains in the same location over a numberof years. Health-care workers must identify movementpatterns of homeless people in their area to at leasttry to bring the best care possible to this unique pop-ulation. This may indeed mean delivering services tothose individuals who do not seek out services ontheir own. Health Issues Life as a homeless person can have se- vere consequences in terms of health. Exposure tothe elements, poor diet, sleep deprivation, risk of violence, injuries, and little or no health care lead toa precarious state of health and exacerbate any pre-existing illnesses. One of the major afflictions is alco-holism. It has been estimated that about 40 percentof homeless individuals abuse alcohol. Compared to other homeless individuals, those who abuse alco-hol are at greater risk for neurological impairment,CHAPTER 36 Community Mental Health Nursing 8234092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:52 PM Page 823heart disease and hypertension, chronic lung disease, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, hepatic dysfunction,and trauma. Thermoregulation is a health problem for all homeless individuals because of their exposure to allkinds of weather. It is a compounded problem for thehomeless alcoholic who spends much time in an altered level of consciousness. It is difficult to determine whether mental illness is a cause or an effect of homelessness. Some behav-iors that may seem deviant to some people may in ac-tuality be adaptations to life on the street. It has beensuggested that some homeless individuals may evenseek hospitalization in psychiatric institutions in anattempt to get off the streets for a while. Outbreaks of tuberculosis among homeless per- sons continue to challenge public control efforts(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC],2013). Crowded shelters provide ideal conditions for spread of respiratory infections among their inhabi-tants. The risk of acquiring tuberculosis is also in-creased by the prevalence of alcoholism, drugaddiction, HIV infection, and poor nutrition amonghomeless individuals. Dietary deficiencies are a continuing problem for homeless individuals. Not only is the homeless personcommonly in a poor nutritional state, but also the con-dition itself exacerbates a number of other health prob-lems. Homeless people suffer from higher mortalityrates and a greater number of serious disorders thantheir counterparts in the general population. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), such as gon- orrhea and syphilis, are a serious problem for thehomeless. One of the most serious STDs prevalentamong homeless individuals is HIV infection. Streetlife is precarious for individuals whose systems are im-munosuppressed by the HIV. Rummaged food scrapsare often spoiled, and exposure to the elements is acontinuous threat. Individuals with HIV disease whostay in shelters often are exposed to the infectious dis-eases of others, which can be life threatening in theirvulnerable condition. HIV disease is a serious problem among the home- less population. The NCH (2009a) reported that an es-timated 3.4 percent of the homeless population areHIV-positive, compared to 0.4 percent within the gen-eral population. It is estimated that up to 50 percentof persons living with HIV disease are expected to needhousing assistance of some kind during their lifetimes. Homeless children have special health needs. The NCH (2009b) reports that children without a homehave higher rates of asthma, ear infections, stomachproblems, and speech problems than their counter-parts who are not homeless. They also experiencemore mental health problems, such as anxiety, de-pression, and withdrawal. They are twice as likely toexperience hunger and four times as likely to have delayed development. 824 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE Rew, L., Fouladi, R.T., & Yockey, R.D. (2002). Sexual health practices of homeless youth. Journal of Nursing Scholarship, 34 (2), 139-145. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to describe the sexual health practices of homeless ado-lescents, examine relationships among variables in a con-ceptual model of sexual health practices, and determinedirect and indirect effects of population characteristics, cog-nitive-perceptual factors, and behavioral factors on sexualhealth practices among homeless adolescents. A surveywas administered to a convenience sample of 4 1 4 home- less young men (244) and women (170) aged 16 to 20 years, the majority of whom were Anglo American. Likert-scale questionnaires were administered seeking in-formation regarding sexually transmitted diseases (STDs),knowledge about AIDS, self-efficacy to use condoms, futuretime perspective, intentions to use condoms, social sup-port, sexual health practices, assertive communication, andbackground information. RESULTS OF THE STUDY: Thirty-five percent of the sample reported homosexual or bisexual orientation, and sexual orientation was reported as a reason for leaving home. Over half reported a history of sexual abuse and nearly 1 in 4 hadbeen treated for gonorrhea. Seven percent had been treatedfor HIV, 8 percent for chlamydia, 3.6 percent for syphilis, and32 percent had received one or more immunizations to pre-vent hepatitis B. Future time perspective scores were low, afinding that was not surprising, knowing the daily challengesof living on the street. Perceived social support scores werealso low, again being an expected finding, due to lack of so-cially supportive environments of homes, parents, and schools.The mean safe-sex behavior score was higher than those in astudy of university males. The authors speculated that this mayindicate that participants were exposed to safe-sex messagesmore frequently at the street outreach center than were theuniversity males. Those participants who had higher scores inperceived social support and assertive communication alsohad higher scores in self-efficacy to use condoms. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The authors suggest that the correlation of self-efficacy to use condoms with so- cial suppor t and asser tive communication may indicate that an intervention directed at the enhancement of assertivecommunication skills and social support might result in 4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:52 PM Page 824Types of Resources Available Homeless Shelters The system of shelters for the home- less in the United States varies widely, from converted warehouses that provide cots or floor space on whichto sleep overnight to significant operations that pro-vide a multitude of social and health-care services.They are run by volunteers and paid professionalsand are sponsored by churches, community govern-ments, and a variety of social agencies. It is impossible, then, to describe a \"typical\" shelter. One profile may be described as the provision of lodg-ing, food, and clothing to individuals who are in needof these services. Some shelters also provide medicaland psychiatric evaluations, first aid and other health-care services, and referral for case management serv-ices by nurses or social workers. Individuals who seek services from the shelter are generally assigned a bed or cot, issued a set of cleanlinen, provided a place to shower, shown laundry fa-cilities, and offered a meal in the shelter kitchen ordining hall. Most shelters attempt to separate dormi-tory areas for men and women, with various conse-quences for those who violate the rules. Shelters cover expenses through private and cor- porate donations, church sponsorships, and govern-ment grants. From the outset, shelters wereconceptualized as \"temporary\" accommodations forindividuals who needed a place to spend the night.Realistically, they have become permanent lodgingfor homeless individuals with little hope for improv-ing their situation. Some individuals use shelters fortheir mailing address. Shelters provide a safe and supportive environ- ment for homeless individuals who have no otherplace to go. Some homeless people who inhabit shel-ters use the resources offered to improve their lot inlife, whereas others become hopelessly dependent onthe shelter's provisions. To a few, the availability of ashelter may even mean the difference between lifeand death. Health-Care Centers and Storefront Clinics Some commu- nities have established \"street clinics\" to serve thehomeless population. Many of these clinics are oper - ated by nurse practitioners who work in consultation with physicians in the area. In recent years, some ofthese clinics have provided clinical sites for nursing stu-dents in their community health rotation. Some havebeen staffed by faculties of nursing schools that haveestablished group practices in the community setting. A wide variety of services are offered at these clin- ics, including administering medications, assessingvital signs, screening for tuberculosis and other com-municable diseases, giving immunizations and flushots, changing dressings, and administering first aid.Physical and psychosocial assessments, health educa-tion, and supportive counseling are also frequent interventions. Nursing in storefront clinics for the homeless pro- vides many special challenges, not the least of whichis poor working conditions. These clinics often oper-ate under severe budgetary constraints with inade-quate staffing, supplies, and equipment, in rundownfacilities located in high-crime neighborhoods. Frus-tration is often high among nurses who work in theseclinics, as they are seldom able to see measurableprogress in their homeless clients. Maintenance ofhealth management is virtually impossible for manyindividuals who have no resources outside the health-care setting. When return appointments for preven-tive care are made, the lack of follow-through is high. Mobile Outreach Units Outreach programs literally reach out to the homeless in their own environmentin an effort to provide health care. V olunteers and paid professionals form teams to drive or walk aroundand seek out homeless individuals who are in need ofassistance. They offer coffee, sandwiches, and blan-kets in an effort to show concern and establish trust.If assistance can be provided at the site, it is done so.If not, ever y effort is made to ensure that the individ- ual is linked with a source that can provide the neces-sary services. Mobile outreach units provide assistance to home- less individuals who are in need of physical or psycho-logical care. The emphasis of outreach programs is toCHAPTER 36 Community Mental Health Nursing 825 IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE\u2014 cont'd increased self-efficacy, which could in turn increase safe- sex behaviors. The authors state: The relationship of intention to use condoms with future time perspective, social connectedness, andself-efficacy to use condoms, but also with sexualhealth responsibility indicates yet another domain inwhich to intervene with homeless adolescents. Inter-ventions that focus on enhancing sexual health responsibility (e.g., seeking health care services if onesuspects an STD or refusing to engage in sexual inter-course with someone known to have HIV) could havepositive effects on these youth. (p. 144) This study provides information that can be used by nurses who work with the homeless population, in an effort to change risky behavior and promote positive health-carehabits under frequently unfavorable conditions.4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:52 PM Page 825accommodate the homeless who refuse to seek treat- ment elsewhere. Most target the mentally ill segmentof the population. When trust has been established,and the individual agrees to come to the team's office,medical and psychiatric treatment is initiated. Involun-tary hospitalization is initiated when an individual isdeemed harmful to self or others, or otherwise meetsthe criteria for being considered \"gravely disabled.\" The Homeless Client and the Nursing Process A case study demonstrating the nursing process witha homeless client is presented in Box 36-5.826 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations BOX 36-5 Case Study: Nursing Process With a Homeless Client ASSESSMENT Joe, age 68, is brought to the Community Health Clinic bytwo of his peers, who repor t: \"He just had a fit. He needs a drink bad!\" Joe is dir ty and unkempt, has visible tremors of the upper extremities, and is weak enough to require assis-tance when ambulating. He is cooperative as the nurse completes the intake assessment. He is coherent, althoughthought processes are slow. He is disoriented to time andplace. He appears somewhat frightened as he scans the unfamiliar surroundings. He is unable to tell the nurse whenhe had his last drink. He reports no physical injury, and noneis observable. Joe carries a small bag with a few personal items inside, including a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefit card,identifying him as a veteran of the Vietnam War. The nursefinds a cot for Joe to lie down, ensures that his vital signs arestable, and telephones the number on the VA card. The clinicnurse discovers that Joe is well known to the admissions per-sonnel at the VA. He has a 35-year history of schizophrenia,with numerous hospitalizations. At the time of his last dis-charge, he was taking fluphenazine (Prolixin) 10 mg twice aday. He told the clinic nurse that he took the medication fora few months after he got out of the hospital but then didnot have the prescription refilled. He could not rememberwhen he had last taken fluphenazine. Joe also has a long history of alcohol-related disorders and has participated in the VA substance rehabilitation programthree times. He has no home address and receives his VAdisability benefit checks at a shelter address. He reports thathe has no family. The nurse makes arrangements for VA per-sonnel to drive Joe from the clinic to the VA hospital, wherehe is admitted for detoxification. She sets up a case man-agement file for Joe and arranges with the hospital to haveJoe return to the clinic after discharge. DIAGNOSIS/OUTCOME IDENTIFICATION The following nursing diagnosis was formulated for Joe: Ineffective health maintenance related to ineffective cop- ing skills evidenced by abuse of alcohol, lack of follow-through with antipsychotic medication, and lack of personalhygiene. Ongoing criteria were selected as outcomes for Joe. T hey include: \u0081Follows the rules of the group home and maintains his res- idency status. \u0081Attends weekly sessions of group therapy at the VA daytreatment prog ram.\u0081Attends weekly sessions of Alcoholics Anonymous andmaintains sobriety . \u0081Repor ts regularly to the health clinic for injections of fluphenazine. \u0081Volunteers at the VA hospital 3 days a week. \u0081Secures and retains permanent employment. PLAN/IMPLEMENTATIONDuring Joe's hospitalization, the clinic nurse remained in con-tact with his case. Joe received complete physical and dentalexaminations and treatment during his hospital stay . T he clinic nurse attended the treatment team meeting for Joe ashis outpatient case manager. It was decided at the meetingto try giving Joe injections of fluphenazine decanoate be-cause of his history of lack of adherence to his daily oralmedication regimen. The clinic nurse would administer theinjection every 4 weeks. At Joe's follow-up clinic visit the nurse explains to Joe that she has found a group home where he may live with otherswho have personal circumstances similar to his. At the grouphome, meals will be provided and the group home managerwill ensure that Joe's basic needs are fulfilled. A criterion forremaining at the residence is for Joe to remain alcohol free.Joe is agreeable to these living arrangements. With Joe's concurrence, the clinic nurse also performs the following interventions: \u0081Goes shopping with Joe to purchase some new clothing, allowing Joe to make decisions as independently as possible. \u0081Helps Joe move into the g roup home and introduces him to the manager and residents. \u0081Helps Joe change his address from the shelter to the grouphome so that he may continue to receive his V A benefits. \u0081Enrolls Joe in the weekly group therapy sessions of the daytreatment facility connected with the V A hospital. \u0081Helps Joe locate the nearest Alcoholics Anonymous groupand identifies a sponsor who will ensure that Joe gets tothe meetings. \u0081Sets up a clinic appointment for Joe to return in 4 weeksfor his fluphenazine injection; telephones Joe 1 day in ad-vance to remind him of his appointment. \u0081Instructs Joe to return to or call the clinic if any of the fol-lowing symptoms occur: sore throat, fever , nausea and vomiting, severe headache, difficulty urinating, tremors, skinrash, or yellow skin or eyes. \u0081Assists Joe in securing transpor tation to and from appointments.4092_Ch36_798-829 23/07/14 12:52 PM Page 826Summary and Key Points The trend in psychiatric care is shifting from that of inpatient hospitalization to a focus of outpatientcare within the community. This trend is largelydue to the need for greater cost-effectiveness in theprovision of medical care to the masses. The community mental health movement began inthe 1960s with the closing of state hospitals and thedeinstitutionalization of many individuals with se-vere and persistent mental illness. Mental health care within the community targetsprimary prevention (reducing the incidence ofmental disorders within the population), second-ary prevention (reducing the prevalence of psychi-atric illness by shortening the course of the illness),and tertiary prevention (reducing the residual de-fects that are associated with severe and persistentmental illness). Primary prevention focuses on identification of pop-ulations at risk for mental illness, increasing theirability to cope with stress, and targeting and dimin-ishing harmful forces within the environment.The focus of secondary prevention is accomplishedthrough early identification of problems andprompt initiation of effective treatment. Tertiary prevention focuses on preventing compli-cations of the illness and promoting rehabilitationthat is directed toward achievement of the individ-ual's maximum level of functioning. Registered nurses serve as providers of psychi-atric/mental health care in the community setting. Nurses provide outpatient care for individuals withsevere and persistent mental illness in communitymental health centers, in day and evening treat-ment programs, in partial hospitalization pro-grams, in community residential facilities, and withpsychiatric home health care. Homeless persons with mental illness provide aspecial challenge for the community mental healthnurse. Care is provided within homeless shelters,at health-care centers or storefront clinics, andthrough mobile outreach programs.CHAPTER 36 Community Mental Health Nursing 827 BOX 36-5 Case Study: Nursing Process With a Homeless Client\u2014cont'd \u0081Encourages Joe to set realistic goals for his life and offers recognition for follow-through. \u0081When Joe is ready, discusses employment alternatives withhim; suggests the possibility of star ting with a volunteer job (perhaps as a V A hospital volunteer).EVALUATIONEvaluation of the nursing process with homeless individualswho have mental illness must be highly individualized. Sta-tistics show that chances for relapse with this population arehigh. T herefore, it is extremely impor tant that outcome crite- ria be realistic so as not to set up the client for failure.

The separation from loved ones or the givingup of treasured possessions, for whatever reason; theexperience of failure, either real or perceived; or lifeevents that create change in a familiar pattern of existence\u2014all can be experienced as loss, and all cantrigger behaviors associated with the grieving process.Loss and bereavement are universal events encoun-tered by all beings that experience emotions. Follow-ing are examples of some notable forms of loss: A significant other (person or pet), through death,divorce, or separation for any reason. Illness or debilitating conditions. Examples include(but are not limited to) diabetes, stroke, cancer,rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer'sdisease, hearing or vision loss, and spinal cord or headinjuries. Some of these conditions not only incur a lossof physical and/or emotional wellness, but may alsoresult in the loss of personal independence. Developmental/maturational changes or situa-tions, such as menopause, andropause, infertility,\"empty nest,\" aging, impotence, or hysterectomy. A decrease in self-esteem due to inability to meetself-expectations or the expectations of others(even if these expectations are only perceived bythe individual as unfulfilled). This includes a lossof potential hopes and dreams. Personal possessions that symbolize familiarity andsecurity in a person's life. Separation from these familiar and personally valued external objects rep-resents a loss of material extensions of the self.mourning are collectively referred to as the grief response. This chapter examines human responses to the experience of loss. Care of bereaved individuals is presented in the context of the nursing process. Theoretical Perspectives on Loss and Bereavement Stages of Grief Behavior patterns associated with the grief response in-clude many individual variations. However, sufficientsimilarities have been observed to warrant characteri-zation of grief as a syndrome that has a predictablecourse with an expected resolution. Early theorists, in-cluding K\u00fcbler-Ross (1969), Bowlby (1961), and Engel(1964), described behavioral stages through which in-dividuals advance in their progression toward resolu-tion. A number of variables influence one's progressionthrough the grief process. Some individuals may reachacceptance, only to revert back to an earlier stage; somemay never complete the sequence; and some may neverprogress beyond the initial stage. A more contemporary grief specialist, J. William Worden (2009), offers a set of tasks that must beprocessed in order to complete the grief response.He suggests that it is possible for a person to accom-plish some of these tasks and not others, resulting inan incomplete bereavement, and thus impairing fur-ther growth and development. A comparison of thesimilarities among these four models is presented inTable 37-1. Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross The following well-known stages of the grief processwere identified by K\u00fcbler-Ross in her extensive workwith dying patients. Behaviors associated with each ofthese stages can be observed in individuals experienc-ing the loss of any concept of personal value. Stage I: Denial. In this stage the individual has dif- ficulty believing that the loss has occurred. He orshe may say, \"No, it can't be true!\" or \"It's just notpossible.\" This stage may protect the individualagainst the psychological pain of reality. Stage II: Anger. This is the stage when reality sets in. Feelings associated with this stage include sad-ness, guilt, shame, helplessness, and hopeless-ness. Self-blame or blaming of others may lead tofeelings of anger toward the self and others. Theanxiety level may be elevated, and the individualmay experience confusion and a decreased abilityto function independently. He or she may be pre-occupied with an idealized image of what hasbeen lost. Numerous somatic complaints arecommon.CORE CONCEPT Loss The experience of separation from something of personal importance. CORE CONCEPT Grief Deep mental and emotional anguish that is a response to the subjective experience of loss of something significant. Some texts differentiate the terms mourning and grief by describing mourning as the psychological process (or stages) through which the individualpasses on the way to successful adaptation to the lossof a valued object. Grief may be viewed as the subjec-tive states that accompany mourning, or the emo-tional work involved in the mourning process.

OngoingIndividual has difficulty believing that the loss has occurred. Anger is directed toward self or others. Ambivalence and guilt may be felt towardthe lost entity. The individual fervently seeks alternatives to improve current situation. Attends to various rituals associated with the culture in which the loss has occurred. The actual work of grieving. Preoccupation with the lost entity. Feelings of helplessness andloneliness occur in response to realization ofthe loss. Feelings associated with the lossare confronted. How the environment changes depends on the roles the lost entity played in the life ofthe bereaved person. Adaptations will haveto be made as the changes are presented indaily life. New coping skills will have to bedeveloped. Resolution is complete. The bereaved person experiences a reinvestment in new relation-ships and new goals. The lost entity is notpurged or replaced, but relocated in the lifeof the bereaved. At this stage, terminally illpersons express a readiness to die.4092_Ch37_830-850 24/07/14 5:37 PM Page 832CHAPTER 37 The Bereaved Individual 833 Stage III: Bargaining. At this stage in the grief re- sponse, the individual attempts to strike a bargain with God for a second chance, or for more time.The person acknowledges the loss, or impendingloss, but holds out hope for additional alterna-tives, as evidenced by statements such as, \"If onlyI could . . .\" or . . . .\" Stage IV: Depression. In this stage, the individual mourns for that which has been or will be lost. Thisis a very painful stage, during which the individualmust confront feelings associated with having lostsomeone or something of value (called reactive de- pression). An example might be the individual whois mourning a change in body image. Feelings as-sociated with an impending loss (called preparatory depression) are also confronted. Examples includepermanent lifestyle changes related to the alteredbody image or even an impending loss of life itself.Regression, withdrawal, and social isolation may beobserved behaviors with this stage. Therapeutic in-tervention should be available, but not imposed,and with guidelines for implementation based onclient readiness. Stage V: Acceptance. At this time, the individual has worked through the behaviors associated withthe other stages and accepts or is resigned to theloss. Anxiety decreases, and methods for copingwith the loss have been established. The client isless preoccupied with what has been lost and in-creasingly interested in other aspects of the envi-ronment. If this is an impending death of self, theindividual is ready to die. The person may becomevery quiet and withdrawn, seemingly devoid offeelings. These behaviors are an attempt to facili-tate the passage by slowly disengaging from the environment. John Bowlby John Bowlby hypothesized four stages in the griefprocess. He implies that these behaviors can be ob-served in all individuals who have experienced theloss of something or someone of value, even in babiesas young as 6 months of age. Stage I: Numbness or Protest. This stage is char- acterized by a feeling of shock and disbelief thatthe loss has occurred. Reality of the loss is not acknowledged. Stage II: Disequilibrium. During this stage, the individual has a profound urge to recover what hasbeen lost. Behaviors associated with this stage in-clude a preoccupation with the loss, intense weep-ing and expressions of anger toward the self andothers, and feelings of ambivalence and guilt asso-ciated with the loss.Stage III: Disorganization and Despair. Feelings of despair occur in response to realization that theloss has occurred. Activities of daily living becomeincreasingly disorganized, and behavior is charac-terized by restlessness and aimlessness. Efforts toregain productive patterns of behavior are ineffec-tive and the individual experiences fear, helpless-ness, and hopelessness. Somatic complaints arecommon. Perceptions of visualizing or being in thepresence of that which has been lost may occur. Social isolation is common, and the individual mayfeel a great deal of loneliness. Stage IV: Reorganization. The individual accepts or becomes resigned to the loss. New goals and pat-terns of organization are established. The individ-ual begins a reinvestment in new relationships andindicates a readiness to move forward within theenvironment. Grief subsides and recedes into val-ued remembrances. George Engel Stage I: Shock and Disbelief. The initial reaction to a loss is a stunned, numb feeling and refusal bythe individual to acknowledge the reality of theloss. Engel states that this stage is an attempt by theindividual to protect the self \"against the effects ofthe overwhelming stress by raising the thresholdagainst its recognition or against the painful feel-ings evoked thereby.\" Stage II: Developing Awareness. This stage begins within minutes to hours of the loss. Behaviors asso-ciated with this stage include excessive crying andregression to a state of helplessness and a childlikemanner. Awareness of the loss creates feelings ofemptiness, frustration, anguish, and despair. Angermay be directed toward the self or toward others in the environment who are held accountable forthe loss. Stage III: Restitution. In this stage, the various rituals associated with loss within a culture areperformed. Examples include funerals, wakes,special attire, a gathering of friends and family,and religious practices customary to the spiritualbeliefs of the bereaved. Participation in these rit-uals is thought to assist the individual to acceptthe reality of the loss and to facilitate the recoveryprocess. Stage IV: Resolution of the Loss. This stage is char- acterized by a preoccupation with the loss. Theconcept of the loss is idealized, and the individualmay even imitate admired qualities of the lost entity. Preoccupation with the loss gradually de-creases over a year or more, and the individualeventually begins to reinvest feelings in others.4092_Ch37_830-850 24/07/14 5:37 PM Page 833Stage V: Recovery. Obsession with the loss has ended, and the individual is able to go on with his or her life. J. William Worden Worden views the bereaved person as active and self-determining rather than a passive participant in thegrief process. He proposes that bereavement includesa set of tasks that must be reconciled in order to com-plete the grief process. Worden's four tasks of mourn-ing include the following: Task I: Accepting the Reality of the Loss. When something of value is lost, it is common for individ-uals to refuse to believe that the loss has occurred.Behaviors include misidentifying individuals in theenvironment for their lost loved one, retaining pos-sessions of the lost loved one as though he or shehas not died, and removing all reminders of thelost loved one so as not to have to face the realityof the loss. Worden (2009) stated: Coming to an acceptance of the reality of the loss takes time since it involves not only an intellectual ac-ceptance but also an emotional one. The bereavedperson may be intellectually aware of the finality ofthe loss long before the emotions allow full accept-ance of the information as true. (p. 42) Belief and denial are intermittent while grappling with this task. It is thought that traditional ritualssuch as the funeral help some individuals move toward acceptance of the loss. Task II: Processing the Pain of Grief. Pain associ-ated with a loss includes both physical pain andemotional pain. This pain must be acknowledgedand worked through. To avoid or suppress it servesonly to delay or prolong the grieving process. Peo-ple do this by refusing to allow themselves to thinkpainful thoughts, by idealizing or avoiding re-minders of lost entity, and by using alcohol ordrugs. The intensity of the pain and the manner inwhich it is experienced are different for all individ-uals. However, the commonality is that it must be experienced. Failure to do so generally results insome form of depression that commonly requirestherapy, which then focuses on working throughthe pain of grief that the individual failed to workthrough at the time of the loss. In this very difficultTask II, individuals must \"allow themselves toprocess the pain\u2014to feel it and to know that oneday it will pass\" (Worden, 2009, p. 45). Task III: Adjusting to a World Without the LostEntity. It usually takes a number of months for a bereaved person to realize what his or her worldwill be like without the lost entity. In the case ofa lost loved one, how the environment changeswill depend on the types of roles that person ful-filled in life. In the case of a changed lifestyle,the individual will be required to make adapta-tions to his or her environment in terms of thechanges as they are presented in daily life. In ad-dition, those individuals who had defined theiridentity through the lost entity will require an adjustment to their own sense of self. Worden(2009) states: The coping strategy of redefining the loss in such a way that it can redound to the benefit of the sur-vivor is often part of the successful completion ofTask III. (p. 47) If the bereaved person experiences failures in his or her attempt to adjust in an environment withoutthe lost entity, feelings of low self-esteem may re-sult. Regressed behaviors and feelings of helpless-ness and inadequacy are not uncommon. Worden(2009) states: [Another] area of adjustment is to one's sense of the world. Loss through death can challenge one's fun-damental life values and philosophical beliefs\u2014beliefs that are influenced by our families, peers, ed-ucation, and religion as well as life experiences. Thebereaved person searches for meaning in the lossand its attendant life changes in order to make senseof it and to regain some control of his or her life.(pp. 48-49) To be successful in Task III, bereaved individuals must develop new skills to cope and adapt to theirnew environment without the lost entity. Successfulachievement of this task determines the outcome ofthe mourning process\u2014that of continued growth ora state of arrested development. Task IV: Finding an Enduring Connection With the Lost Entity in the Midst of Embarking on a New Life. This task allows for the bereaved personto identify a special place for the lost entity. Indi-viduals need not purge from their history or find areplacement for that which has been lost. Instead,there is a kind of continued presence of the lostentity that only becomes relocated in the life of the bereaved. Successful completion of Task IV in-volves letting go of past attachments and formingnew ones. However, there is also the recognitionthat although the relationship between the be-reaved and what has been lost is changed, it isnonetheless still a relationship. Worden (2009) suggested that one never loses memories of a sig-nificant relationship. He states: For many people, Task IV is the most difficult one to accomplish. They get stuck at this point in their834 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch37_830-850 24/07/14 5:37 PM Page 834grieving and later realize that their life in some way stopped at the point the loss occurred. (p. 52) Worden (2009) related the story of a teenaged girl who had a difficult time adjusting to thedeath of her father. After 2 years, when she beganto finally fulfill some of the tasks associated withsuccessful grieving, she wrote these words that express rather clearly what bereaved people inTask IV are struggling with: \"There are other peo-ple to be loved, and it doesn't mean that I loveDad any less\" (p. 52). Length of the Grief Response Stages of grief allow bereaved persons an orderly ap-proach to the resolution of mourning. Each stagepresents tasks that must be overcome through apainful experiential process. Engel (1964) has statedthat successful resolution of the grief response isthought to have occurred when a bereaved individualis able \"to remember comfortably and realisticallyboth the pleasures and disappointments of [thatwhich is lost].\" The length of the grief process de-pends on the individual and can last for a number ofyears without being maladaptive. The acute phase ofnormal grieving usually lasts about 6 to 8 weeks\u2014longer in older adults\u2014but complete resolution ofthe grief response may take much longer. Sadock andSadock (2007) stated: Ample evidence suggests that the bereavement process does not end within a prescribed interval; cer-tain aspects persist indefinitely for many otherwisehigh-functioning, normal individuals. Common man-ifestations of protracted grief occur intermittently.Most grief does not fully resolve or permanently dis-appear; rather grief becomes circumscribed and sub-merged only to reemerge in response to certaintriggers. (p. 64) A number of factors influence the eventual out- come of the grief response. The grief response can be more difficult if: The bereaved person was strongly dependent onor perceived the lost entity as an important meansof physical and/or emotional support. The relationship with the lost entity was highlyambivalent. A love-hate relationship may instillfeelings of guilt that can interfere with the griefwork. The individual has experienced a number of re-cent losses. Grief tends to be cumulative, and if pre-vious losses have not been resolved, each succeedinggrief response becomes more difficult.The loss is that of a young person. Grief over lossof a child is often more intense than it is over theloss of an elderly person. The state of the person's physical or psychologicalhealth is unstable at the time of the loss. The bereaved person perceives (whether real orimagined) some responsibility for the loss. The grief response may be facilitated if: The individual has the support of significant othersto assist him or her through the mourning process. The individual has the opportunity to prepare forthe loss. Grief work is more intense when the lossis sudden and unexpected. The experience of anticipatory grieving is thought to facilitate the grief response that occurs at the time of the actual loss. Worden (2009) states: There is a sense in which mourning can be finished, when people regain an interest in life, feel morehopeful, experience gratification again, and adapt tonew roles. There is also a sense in which mourning is never finished. [People must understand] thatmourning is a long-term process and that the culmi-nation will not be a pre-grief state. (p. 77) Anticipatory Grief Anticipatory grieving is the experiencing of the feel- ings and emotions associated with the normal grief response before the loss actually occurs. One dissim-ilar aspect relates to the fact that conventional grieftends to diminish in intensity with the passage of time.Anticipatory grief can become more intense as the expected loss becomes imminent. Although anticipatory grief is thought to facilitate the actual mourning process following the loss, there may besome problems. In the case of a dying person, difficultiescan arise when the family members complete the processof anticipatory grief, and detachment from the dyingperson occurs prematurely. The person who is dying experiences feelings of loneliness and isolation as the psy-chological pain of imminent death is faced without fam-ily support. Another example of difficulty associated withpremature completion of the grief response is one thatcan occur on the return of persons long absent and pre-sumed dead (e.g., soldiers missing in action or prisonersof war). In this instance, resumption of the previous relationship may be difficult for the bereaved person. Anticipatory grieving may serve as a defense for some individuals to ease the burden of loss when itactually occurs. It may prove to be less functional forothers who, because of interpersonal, psychological,or sociocultural variables, are unable in advance ofthe actual loss to express the intense feelings that accompany the grief response.CHAPTER 37 The Bereaved Individual 8354092_Ch37_830-850 24/07/14 5:37 PM Page 835836 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE Bratcher, J.R. (2010). How do critical care nurses define a \"good death\" in the intensive care unit? Critical CareNursing Quarterly, 33(1), 87-99. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to explore and describe the characteristics of a good death as defined by critical care nurses working in the in-tensive care unit (ICU). T he number of deaths in the ICU is likely to increase as the population ages and the use oflife-prolong ing technologies expands. Research has indi- cated a growing awareness of inadequacies with end-of-life (EOL) care in the ICU. The author states, \"Findingsfrom the Committee on Care at the End of Life demon-strated that people suffer needlessly at the EOL; physiciansand nurses lack basic training necessary to provide EOLcare; economic, cultural, and organizational structures inthe US healthcare system encumbers the delivery of goodEOL care; and knowledge to guide care for patients at theEOL is deficient\" (p. 87). RESULTS OF THE STUDY: The study group consisted of 15 registered nurses (5 males; 10 females) working in the medical/surgical ICU at a Veteran's Administration hospital in a mid-sized urban city. Ages ranged from 36 to 59, andyears in nursing ranged from 3 to 26. Eight participants hadassociate degrees and 7 had baccalaureate degrees. Per-sonal interviews were conducted by the author and lastedup to 60 minutes. Interviews were taped and transcribedverbatim. Each interview started with the question, \"Howdo you define a good death in the ICU?\" Nurses were en-couraged to recall personal situations with specific patientswhom they believed had experienced a good death. Agreat deal of diversity was revealed in the participants' descriptions of a good death. Following are various themesthat emerged. The number in parentheses indicates the number of nurses who identified each theme in theirinterview. \u0081Patient does not die alone (11) (includes allowing patient's pet) \u0081Patient does not suffer (10) (includes those who sug-gested patient's death is quick) \u0081Acceptance of death by patient and/or loved ones (8) \u0081Patient dies with dignity (3) (implying with solemnity,peace, and respect) \u0081Religious/spiritual/cultural needs are met (3) \u0081Patient's and/or family's wishes are honored (3) \u0081Patient was not successfully resuscitated, but stafftried their best (2) \u0081Music is allowed (1) \u0081Environment is quiet (1) \u0081Staff does not panic (1) \u0081Family does not panic (1) or scream or cry out loudin distress (1) IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The results of this study offer information applicable to EOL care in the critical care setting. T he author suggested that there is a need to recognize that palliative care in the ICU can coexist with cur- ative care. The author concluded, \"Critical care nurses havean opportunity to provide excellent EOL care for their pa-tients, but they must first understand what constitutes a gooddeath; obtaining this information will help facilitate compas-sionate EOL care, which will ultimately improve the nursingcare of dying patients and their families in the ICU\" (p. 97). Maladaptive Responses to Loss When, then, is the grieving response considered to be maladaptive? Three types of pathological grief re-actions have been described. These include delayedor inhibited grief, an exaggerated or distorted griefresponse, and chronic or prolonged grief. Delayed or Inhibited Grief Delayed or inhibited grief refers to the absence of ev-idence of grief when it ordinarily would be expected.Many times, cultural influences, such as the expecta-tion to keep a \"stiff upper lip,\" cause the delayed response. Delayed or inhibited grief is potentially pathological because the person is simply not dealing with the real-ity of the loss. He or she remains fixed in the denialstage of the grief process, sometimes for many years.When this occurs, the grief response may be triggered,sometimes many years later, when the individual expe-riences a subsequent loss. Sometimes the grief processis triggered spontaneously or in response to a seeminglyinsignificant event. Overreaction to another person'sloss may be one manifestation of delayed grief . The recognition of delayed grief is critical because, depending on the profoundness of the loss, the fail-ure of the mourning process may prevent assimilationof the loss and thereby delay a return to satisfying liv-ing. Delayed grieving most commonly occurs becauseof ambivalent feelings toward the lost entity, outsidepressure to resume normal function, or perceivedlack of internal and external resources to cope with aprofound loss. Distorted (Exaggerated) Grief Response In the distorted grief reaction, all of the symptoms as-sociated with normal grieving are exaggerated. Feelingsof sadness, helplessness, hopelessness, powerlessness,4092_Ch37_830-850 24/07/14 5:37 PM Page 836anger, and guilt, as well as numerous somatic com- plaints, render the individual dysfunctional in terms of management of daily living. Murray, Zentner, andYakimo (2009) described an exaggerated grief reactionin the following way: An intensification of grief to the point that the person is overwhelmed, demonstrates prolonged maladaptivebehavior, manifests excessive symptoms and extensiveinterruptions in healing, and does not progress to integration of the loss, finding meaning in the loss,and resolution of the mourning process. (p. 706) When the exaggerated grief reaction occurs, the individual remains fixed in the anger stage of the grief response. This anger may be directed towardothers in the environment to whom the individualmay be attributing the loss. However, many times theanger is turned inward on the self. When this occurs,depression is the result. Depressive mood disorder isa type of exaggerated grief reaction. Chronic or Prolonged Grieving Some authors have discussed a chronic or prolongedgrief response as a type of maladaptive grief response.Care must be taken in making this determination because, as was stated previously, length of the griefresponse depends on the individual. An adaptive re-sponse may take years for some people. A prolongedprocess may be considered maladaptive when certainbehaviors are exhibited. Prolonged grief may be aproblem when behaviors such as maintaining per-sonal possessions aimed at keeping a lost loved onealive (as though he or she will eventually reenter thelife of the bereaved) or disabling behaviors that prevent the bereaved from adaptively performing ac-tivities of daily living are in evidence. Another exampleis of a widow who refused to participate in family gath-erings following the death of her husband. For manyyears until her own death, she took a sandwich to thecemetery on holidays, sat on the tombstone, and ateher \"holiday meal\" with her husband. Other bereavedindividuals have been known to set a place at the tablefor the deceased loved one long after the completedmourning process would have been expected. Normal versus Maladaptive Grieving Several authors have identified one crucial difference be-tween normal and maladaptive grieving: the loss of self-esteem. Marked feelings of worthlessness are indicativeof depression rather than uncomplicated bereavement.Corr and Corr (2013) state, \"Normal grief reactions donot include the loss of self-esteem commonly found inmost clinical depression\" (p. 241). Pies (2013) affirmed: Unlike the person with MDD [Major depressive dis- order], most recently bereaved individuals are usu-ally not preoccupied with feelings of worthlessness,hopelessness, or unremitting gloom; rather, self-esteem is usually preserved; the bereaved person canenvision a \"better day;\" and positive thoughts andfeelings are often interspersed with negative ones. It is thought that this major difference between normal grieving and a maladaptive grieving response (the feeling of worthlessness or low self-esteem) ulti-mately precipitates depression, which can be a pro-gressive situation for some individuals. A summary ofdifferences between normal grieving and clinical depression is presented in Table 37-2.CHAPTER 37 The Bereaved Individual 837 TABLE 37-2 Normal Grief Reactions versus Symptoms of Clinical Depression NORMAL GRIEF CLINICAL DEPRESSION Self-esteem is intact May openly express angerExperiences a mixture of \"good and bad days\"Able to experience moments of pleasureAccepts comfort and suppor t from others Maintains feeling of hopeMay express guilt feelings over some aspect of the lossRelates feelings of depression to specific loss experiences May experience transient physical symptoms SOURCES: Corr & Corr (2013); Pies (2013); and Sadock & Sadock (2007).Self-esteem is disturbedUsually does not directly express angerIs in a persistent state of dysphoriaAnhedonia is prevalentDoes not respond to social interaction and support from others Feelings of hopelessness prevailHas generalized feelings of guiltDoes not relate feelings to a particular experienceExpresses chronic physical complaints4092_Ch37_830-850 24/07/14 5:37 PM Page 837Application of the Nursing Process Background Assessment Data: Concepts of Death\u2014Developmental Issues All individuals have their own unique concept of death, which is influenced by past experiences withdeath as well as age and level of emotional develop-ment. This section addresses the various perceptionsof death according to developmental age. Children Birth to Age 2 Infants are unable to recognize and understanddeath, but they can experience the feelings of lossand separation. Infants who are separated from theirmother may become quiet, lose weight, and sleep less.Children at this age will likely sense changes in the at-mosphere of the home where a death has occurred.They often react to the emotions of adults by becom-ing more irritable and crying more. Ages 3 to 5 Preschoolers and kindergartners have some under-standing about death but often have difficulty distin-guishing between fantasy and reality. They believedeath is reversible, and their thoughts about deathmay include magical thinking. For example, they maybelieve that their thoughts or behaviors caused a per-son to become sick or to die. Children of this age are capable of understanding at least some of what they see and hear from adultconversations or media reports. They become fright-ened if they feel a threat to themselves or their lovedones. They are concerned with safety issues and re-quire a great deal of personal reassurance that theywill be protected. Regressive behaviors, such as loss ofbladder or bowel control, thumb sucking, and tempertantrums are common. Changes in eating and sleep-ing patterns may also occur. Ages 6 to 9 Children at this age are beginning to understand the finality of death. They are able to understand amore detailed explanation of why or how a persondied, although the concept of death is often associ-ated with old age or with accidents. They may believethat death is contagious and avoid association with in-dividuals who have experienced a loss by death. Deathis often personified, in the form of a \"bogey man\" ora monster\u2014someone who takes people away or some-one whom they can avoid if they try hard enough. It is difficult for them to perceive their own death.Normal grief reactions at this age include regressiveand aggressive behaviors, withdrawal, school phobias,somatic symptoms, and clinging behaviors.Ages 10 to 12 Preadolescent children are able to understand thatdeath is final and eventually affects everyone, includ-ing themselves. They are interested in the physical aspects of dying and the final disposition of the body.They may ask questions about how the death will affect them personally. Feelings of anger, guilt, and de-pression are common. Peer relationships and schoolperformance may be disrupted. There may be a pre-occupation with the loss and a withdrawal into the self.They will require reassurance of their own safety andself-worth. Adolescents Adolescents are usually able to view death on an adultlevel. They understand death to be universal and in-evitable; however, they have difficulty tolerating theintense feelings associated with the death of a lovedone. They may or may not cry. They may withdrawinto themselves or attempt to go about usual activitiesin an effort to avoid dealing with the pain of the loss.Some teens exhibit acting-out behaviors, such as ag-gression and defiance. It is often easier for adoles-cents to discuss their feelings with peers than withtheir parents or other adults. Some adolescents mayshow regressive behaviors, whereas others react by try-ing to take care of their loved ones who are also griev-ing. In general, individuals of this age group have anattitude of immortality. Although they understandthat their own death is inevitable, the concept is sofar-reaching as to be imperceptible. Adults The adult's concept of death is influenced by experi-ential, cultural, and religious backgrounds (Murrayet al., 2009). Behaviors associated with grieving in theadult were discussed in the section on \"TheoreticalPerspectives on Loss and Bereavement.\" Older Adults Philosophers and poets have described late adult-hood as the \"season of loss.\" Jeffreys (2010) states: The grief of older people is unique because of the many non-death losses that are a part of aging. Theseinclude physical changes, changes in family, occupa-tional and social roles, relocation and shifts in mentalfunctioning. (p. 18) By the time individuals reach their 60s and 70s, they have experienced numerous losses, and mourn- ing has become a lifelong process. Those who aremost successful at adapting earlier in life will similarlycope better with the losses and grief inherent inaging. Unfortunately, with the aging process comes aconvergence of losses, the timing of which makes itimpossible for the aging individual to complete the838 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch37_830-850 24/07/14 5:37 PM Page 838grief process in response to one loss before another occurs. Because grief is cumulative, this can result inbereavement overload ; the person is less able to adapt and reintegrate, and mental and physical health isjeopardized (Halstead, 2005). Bereavement overloadhas been implicated as a predisposing factor in thedevelopment of depressive disorder in older adults. Background Assessment Data: Concepts of Death\u2014Cultural Issues As previously stated, bereavement practices are greatly influenced by cultural and religious back-grounds. It is important for health-care professionalsto have an understanding of these individual differ-ences in order to provide culturally sensitive care totheir clients. Clinicians must be able to identify andappreciate what is culturally expected or required, be-cause failure to carry out expected rituals may hinderthe grief process and result in unresolved grief forsome bereaved individuals. Box 37-1 provides a set ofguidelines for assessing culturally specific death ritu-als. Following is a discussion of selected culturally specific death rituals. African Americans Customs of bereaved African Americans are similarto those of the dominant American culture of thesame religion and social class, with a blending of cultural practices from the African heritage. MostAfrican American Christians are affiliated with theBaptist and Methodist denominations (Campinha-Bacote, 2013). Campinha-Bacote (2013) states: One response to hearing about a death of a family member or close member in the African Americanculture is \"falling-out,\" which is manifested by suddencollapse and paralysis and the inability to see orspeak. However, the individual's hearing and under-standing remain intact. Health care practitionersmust understand the African American culture torecognize this condition as a cultural response to thedeath of a family member or other severe emotionalshock and not as a medical condition requiring emer-gency intervention. (p. 106) Funeral services may differ from the traditional European American service with ceremonies and rituals modified by the musical rhythms and patterns of speechand worship that are unique to African Americans. Feel-ings are expressed openly and publicly at the funeral,and eulogies are extremely important. Services usuallyconclude with a viewing of the body and burial at acemetery. Burial rather than cremation is usually chosen(Asante, 2009). Many African Americans attempt to maintain a strong connection with their loved ones who havedied. This connection may take the form of commu-nication with the deceased's spirit through mediumswho are believed to possess this special capability. Asian Americans Chinese Americans Death and bereavement in the Chinese tradition arecentered on ancestor worship. Chinese people havean intuitive fear of death and avoid references to it.Tsai (2013) states: Many Chinese are hesitant to purchase life insurance because of their fear that it is inviting death. Thecolor white is associated with death and is consideredbad luck. Black is also a bad luck color. (p. 189) In the traditional Chinese culture, people often do not express their emotions openly. Mourners are rec- ognized by black armbands and white strips of clothtied around their heads (Tsai, 2013). The dead arehonored by placing food, money for the person'sspirit, or articles made of paper around the coffin. Japanese Americans The dominant religion among the Japanese is Buddhism. On death of a loved one, the body is pre-pared by close family members. This is followed by a2-day period of visitation by family and friends, duringwhich there is prayer, burning of incense, and pres-entation of gifts. Funeral ceremonies are held at theBuddhist temple, and cremation is common. Themourning period is 49 days, the end of which ismarked by a family prayer service and the serving ofspecial rice dishes. It is believed that at this time, thedeparted has joined those already in the hereafter.Perpetual prayers may be donated through a gift tothe temple (Ito & Hattori, 2013). Vietnamese Americans Buddhism is the predominant religion among theVietnamese. Attitudes toward death are influenced bythe Buddhist emphasis on cyclic continuity and rein-carnation. Many Vietnamese people believe that birthand death are predestined.CHAPTER 37 The Bereaved Individual 839 BOX 37-1 Guidelines for Assessing Culturally Specific Death Rituals DEATH RITUALS AND EXPECTATIONS 1.

Identify cultural responses to death and grief.5. Explore the meaning of death, dying, and the afterlife. Adapted from Purnell, L.D. (2013). The Purnell model for Purnell (Ed.), Transcultural health care: PA: F.A. Davis.4092_Ch37_830-850 24/07/14 5:37 PM Page 839Most Vietnamese people prefer to die at home, and most do not approve of autopsy. Cremation is common. The final moments before the funeral pro-cession are a time of prayer for the immediate fam-ily. Individuals in mourning wear white clothing for14 days. During the following year, men wear black arm-bands and women wear white headbands (Mattson,2013). The 1-year anniversary of an individual'sdeath is commemorated. Clergy should only becalled to visit the sick at the request of the client orfamily, and is usually associated with last rites, espe-cially by Vietnamese people who practice Catholi-cism. For this reason, hospital visitation by clergymay be very upsetting to clients. Receiving flowersalso may be distressing, as flowers usually are re-served for the rites of the dead (Appel, 2013). Filipino Americans Following a death in the Filipino community, a wakeis held with family and friends. This wake usually takesplace in the home of the deceased and lasts up to a week before the funeral. A large proportion of Filipinos are Catholic. Munoz (2013) states: Among Catholics, 9 days of novenas are held in the home or in the church. These special prayers askGod's blessing for the deceased. Depending upon theeconomic resources of the family, food and refresh-ments are served after each prayer day. Sometimesthe last day of the novena takes on the atmosphereof a fiesta or a celebration. Filipino families in the United States follow variations of this ritual accordingto their social and economic circumstances. (p. 242) Most follow the traditional custom of wearing dark clothing\u2014black armbands for men and black dresses for women\u2014for 1 year after the death, at which timeritualistic mourning officially ends. Emotional out-bursts of uncontrolled crying are common expres-sions of grief. Fainting as a bereavement practice isnot uncommon (Munoz, 2013). Burial of the body ismost common, but cremation is acceptable. Jewish Americans Traditional Judaism believes in an afterlife, where thesoul continues to flourish, although today, many dis-pute this interpretation (Selekman, 2013). However,most Jewish people show little concern about life afterdeath and focus is concentrated more on how oneconducts one's present life. Taking one's own life isforbidden, and ultraconservative Jewish people maydeny the person who commits suicide full burial hon-ors; however, the more liberal view is to emphasize theneeds of the survivors. A dying person is never left alone. At death, the face is covered with a cloth, and the body is treatedwith respect. Autopsy is only allowed if it is requiredby law, the deceased person has requested it, or it maysave the life of another (Selekman, 2013). For the funeral, the body is wrapped in a shroud and placed in a wooden, unadorned casket. No wakeand no viewing are part of a Jewish funeral. Cremationis prohibited. Selekman (2013) states: After the funeral, mourners are welcomed to the home of the closest relative. Water to wash one'shands before entering is outside the front door, sym-bolic of cleansing the impurities associated with con-tact with the dead. The water is not passed fromperson to person, just as it is hoped that the tragedyis not passed. At the home, a meal is served to all theguests. This \"meal of condolence\" or \"meal of conso-lation\" is traditionally provided by the neighbors andfriends. (p. 350) The 7-day period beginning with the burial is called shiva. During this time, mourners do not work, and no activity is permitted that diverts attention from thinking about the deceased. Mourning lasts 30 daysfor a relative and 1 year for a parent, at which time atombstone is erected and a graveside service is held(Selekman, 2013). Mexican Americans Most Mexican Americans view death as a natural partof life. The predominant religion is Catholic, andmany of the death rituals are a reflection of these re-ligious beliefs. A vigil by family members is kept overthe sick or dying person. Following the death, largenumbers of family and friends gather for a velorio , a festive watch over the body of the deceased person(Zoucha & Zamarripa, 2013). Evening group prayers(novenario) follow for 9 days following the burial (Salazar, 2009). Mourning is called lutoand is symbolized by wear- ing black, black and white, or dark clothing and bysubdued behavior. Often the bereaved refrain fromattending movies or social events and from listeningto radio or watching television. For middle-aged orelderly Mexican Americans, the period of bereave-ment may last for 2 years or more. These mourningbehaviors do not indicate a sign of respect for thedead; instead, they demonstrate evidence that the individual is grieving for a loved one. Burial is morecommon than cremation, and often the body isburied within 24 hours of death, which is required bylaw in Mexico (Zoucha & Zamarripa, 2013). Native Americans More than 500 Native American tribes are now recog-nized by the U.S. government. Although many of thetribal traditions have been modified throughout theyears, some of the traditional Native American valueshave been preserved.840 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch37_830-850 24/07/14 5:37 PM Page 840The Navajo of the Southwest, the largest Native American tribe in the United States, do not bury the body of a deceased person for 4 days after death. Be-liefs require that a cleansing ceremony take place be-fore burial to prevent the spirit of the dead personfrom trying to assume control of someone else's spirit(Purnell, 2009). The dead are buried with their shoeson the wrong feet and rings on their index fingers.The Navajo generally do not express their griefopenly and are reluctant to touch the body of a deadperson. Purnell (2009) states: One death taboo involves talking with clients con- cerning a fatal disease or illness. Effective discussionsrequire that the issue be presented in the third per-son, as if the illness or disorder occurred with some-one else. [The health-care provider must] neversuggest that the client is dying. To do so would implythat the provider wishes the client dead. If the clientdoes die, it would imply that the provider may haveevil powers. (p. 314) Nursing Diagnosis/Outcome Identification From analysis of the assessment data, appropriate nurs- ing diagnoses are formulated for the client and familyexperiencing grief and loss. From these identified di-agnoses, accurate planning of nursing care is executed.Possible nursing diagnoses for grieving persons include: Risk for complicated grieving related to loss of avalued entity/concept; loss of a loved one Risk for spiritual distress related to complicatedgrief process The following criteria may be used for measure- ment of outcomes in the care of the grieving client: The client: Acknowledges awareness of the loss. Is able to express feelings about the loss. Verbalizes stages of the grief process and behaviorsassociated with each. Expresses personal satisfaction and support fromspiritual practices. Planning/Implementation Table 37-3 provides a plan of care for the grieving per-son. Selected nursing diagnoses are presented, alongwith outcome criteria, appropriate nursing interven-tions, and rationales for each.CHAPTER 37 The Bereaved Individual 841 Table 37-3 | CARE PLAN FOR THE GRIEVING PERSON NURSING DIAGNOSIS: RISK FOR COMPLICATED GRIEVING RELATED TO: Loss of a valued entity/concept; loss of a loved one OUTCOME CRITERIA NURSING INTERVENTIONS RATIONALE Short-Term Goals \u0081 Client will acknowledge awareness of the loss \u0081 Client will express feelings about the loss \u0081 Client will verbalize own position in the grief process Long-Term Goal \u0081 Client will progress through the grief process in a healthful manner toward resolution.1.Assess client's stage in the griefprocess. 2.Develop trust.

Evaluation In the final step of the nursing process, a reassess- ment is conducted to determine if the nursing actionshave been successful in achieving the objectives ofcare. Evaluation of the nursing actions for the griev-ing client may be facilitated by gathering informationusing the following types of questions: Has the client discussed the recent loss with staffand family members? Is the client able to verbalize feelings and behaviorsassociated with each stage of the grieving process andrecognize his or her own position in the process? Has obsession with and idealization of the lost entity subsided? Is anger toward the loss expressed appropriately? Is the client able to participate in usual religiouspractices and feel satisfaction and support fromthem? Is the client seeking out interaction with others inan appropriate manner?Is the client able to verbalize positive aspects abouthis or her life, past relationships, and prospects forthe future? Additional Assistance Hospice Hospice is a program that provides palliative and supportive care to meet the special needs of peoplewho are dying and their families. Hospice care pro-vides physical, psychological, spiritual, and social carefor the person for whom aggressive treatment is nolonger appropriate. Various models of hospice exist,including freestanding institutions that provide bothinpatient and home care, those affiliated with hospi-tals and nursing homes in which hospice services areprovided within the institutional setting, and hospiceorganizations that provide home care only. Histori-cally, the hospice movement in the United States hasevolved mainly as a system of home-based care.4092_Ch37_830-850 24/07/14 5:37 PM Page 843Hospice helps clients achieve physical and emo- tional comfort so that they can concentrate on living life as fully as possible. Clients are urged to stay activefor as long as they are able\u2014to take part in activitiesthey enjoy, and to focus on the quality of life. The National Hospice and Palliative Care Organi- zation (NHPCO) (2000) has published standards ofcare based on principles that are directed at the hos-pice program concept. These principles of care arepresented in Box 37-2. Hospice follows an interdisciplinary team ap- proach to provide care for the terminally ill individualin the familiar surroundings of the home environ-ment. The interdisciplinary team consists of nurses,attendants (homemakers, home health aides), physi-cians, social workers, volunteers, and health-careworkers from other disciplines as required for indi-vidual clients.The hospice approach is based on seven compo- nents: the interdisciplinary team, pain and symptommanagement, emotional support to client and family,pastoral and spiritual care, bereavement counseling,24-hour on-call nurse/counselor, and staff support.These are the ideal, and not all hospice programs mayinclude all of these services. Interdisciplinary Team Nurses A registered nurse usually acts as case manager forcare of hospice clients. The nurse assesses the client'sand family's needs, establishes the goals of care, su-pervises and assists caregivers, evaluates care, servesas client advocate, and provides educational informa-tion as needed to client, family, and caregivers. He orshe also provides physical care when needed, includ-ing IV therapy.844 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations BOX 37-2 Principles of Care\u2014National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization ACCESS, RIGHTS AND ETHICS Access: The hospice offers palliative care to terminally ill pa- tients and their families regardless of age, gender , nation- ality, race, creed, sexual orientation, disability, diagnoses,availability of primary caregiver or ability to pay. Rights: The hospice respects and honors the rights of each patient and family it serves. Ethics: The hospice assumes responsibility for ethical decision- making and behavior related to the provision of hospice care. BEREAVEMENT CARE AND SERVICESAddressing issues related to loss, grief and bereavement be-gi ns at the time of admission to the hospice with the initial assessment and continues throughout the course of care.Bereavement services are provided to help patients, familiesand caregivers cope with the multitude of losses that occurduring the illness and eventual death of the patient. Bereave-ment services are offered based on a number of factors in-cluding the individual assessment, intensity of grief, copingability of the survivors and their needs, as perceived by eachpatient, family and caregiver. CLINICAL CARE AND SERVICES The desired outcomes of hospice intervention are safe andcomfor table dying, self-determined life closure and effective g rieving, all as determined by the patient and family/caregivers. The interdisciplinary team identifies, assists and respects thedesires of the patient and family/caregivers in the facilitationof these outcomes through treatment, prevention and promo-tion of strategies based on continuous assessment. COORDINATION AND CONTINUI TY OF CARE The hospice provides coordinated and uninterrupted serv- ice and assures continuity of care across settings from admission through discharge and subsequent bereave-ment care. H UMAN RESOURCES Hospice organizational leaders ensure that the number and qualifications of staff and volunteers are appropriate to thescope of care and services provided by the hospice prog ram. I NTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM The hospice interdisciplinary team, in collaboration with thepatient, family and careg i ver, develops and maintains a pa- tient, family and caregiver-directed, individualized, safe andcoordinated plan of palliative care. LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE Hospice has an organizational leadership structure that permits and facilitates action and decision making by thoseindividuals closest to any issue or process. MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION The hospice identifies and collects information needed tooperate in an efficient manner . Such information is handled in a manner that respects the patient's, family's and hospice'sconfidentiality . PERFORMANCE IMPR O VEMENT AND OUTCOMES MEASUREMENTThe hospice defines a systematic, planned approach to improving per f ormance. This approach is authorized and supported by the governing body and leaders. SAFETY AND INFECTION CONTROL The hospice provides for the safety of all staff and promotesthe development and maintenance of a safe environmentfor patients and families served. Adapted from National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (2000). Standards of Practice for Hospice Programs. Alexandria, VA: Author. Item No. 711077, available from NHPCO 1-800-646-6460.4092_Ch37_830-850 24/07/14 5:37 PM Page 844Attendants These individuals are usually the members of the team who spend the most time with the client. They assist withpersonal care and all activities of daily living. Withoutthese daily attendants, many individuals would be unableto spend their remaining days in their home. Attendantsmay be noncertified and provide basic housekeepingservices; they may be certified nursing assistants who as-sist with personal care; or they may be licensed vocationalor practical nurses who provide more specialized care,such as dressing changes or tube feedings. Physicians The client's primary physician and the hospice med-ical consultant have input into the care of the hospiceclient. Orders may continue to come from the pri-mary physician, whereas pain and symptom manage-ment may come from the hospice consultant. Ideally,these physicians attend weekly client care conferencesand provide in-service education for hospice staff aswell as others in the medical community. Social Workers The social worker assists the client and family mem-bers with psychosocial issues, including those associ-ated with the client's condition, financial issues, legalneeds, and bereavement concerns. The social workerprovides information on community resources fromwhich client and family may receive support and as-sistance. Some of the functions of the nurse and socialworker may overlap at times. Trained Volunteers Volunteers are vital to the hospice concept. They provide services that may otherwise be financially im-possible. They are specially selected and extensivelytrained, and they provide services such as transporta-tion, companionship, respite care, recreational activ-ities, light housekeeping, and in general are sensitiveto the needs of families in stressful situations. Rehabilitation Therapists Physical therapists may assist hospice clients in an ef-fort to minimize physical disability. They may assistwith strengthening exercises and provide assistancewith special equipment needs. Occupational thera-pists may help the debilitated client learn to accom-plish activities of daily living as independently aspossible. Other consultants, such as speech therapists,may be called upon for the client with special needs. Dietitian A nutritional consultant may be helpful to the hos-pice client who is experiencing nausea and vomiting,diarrhea, anorexia, and weight loss. A nutritionist canensure that the client is receiving the proper balanceof calories and nutrients.Counseling Services The hospice client may require the services of a psy-chiatrist or psychologist if there is a history of mentalillness, or if neurocognitive disorder or depressionhas become a problem. Other types of counselingservices are available to provide assistance in dealingwith the special needs of each client. Pain and Symptom Management Improved quality of life at all times is a primary goal ofhospice care. Thus, a major intervention for all care-givers is to ensure that the client is as comfortable aspossible, whether experiencing pain or other types ofsymptoms common in the terminal stages of an illness. Emotional Support Members of the hospice team encourage clients andfamilies to discuss the eventual outcome of the dis-ease process. Some individuals find discussing issuesassociated with death and dying uncomfortable, andif so, their decision is respected. However, honest dis-cussion of these issues provides a sense of relief forsome people, and they are more realistically preparedfor the future. It may even draw some clients and fam-ilies closer together during this stressful time. Pastoral and Spiritual Care Hospice philosophy supports the individual's right toseek guidance or comfort in the spiritual practicesmost suited to that person. The hospice team mem-bers help the client obtain the spiritual support andguidance for which he or she expresses a preference. Bereavement Counseling Hospice provides a service to surviving family mem-bers or significant others after the death of their lovedone. This is usually provided by a bereavement coun-selor, but when one is not available, volunteers withspecial training in bereavement care may be of serv-ice. A grief support group may be helpful for the be-reaved and provide a safe place for them to discusstheir own fears and concerns about the death of aloved one. Twenty-Four-Hour On-Call The standards of care set forth by NHPCO state thatcare shall be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.A nurse or counselor is usually available by phone orfor home visits around the clock. The knowledge thatemotional or physical support is available at any time,should it be required, provides considerable supportand comfort to significant others or family caregivers. Staff Support Team members (all who work closely and frequentlywith the client) often experience emotions similar toCHAPTER 37 The Bereaved Individual 8454092_Ch37_830-850 24/07/14 5:37 PM Page 845those of the client or their family and/or significant oth- ers. They may experience anger, frustration, or fearsof death and dying\u2014all of which must be addressedthrough staff support groups, team conferences, timeoff, and adequate and effective supervision. Burnoutis a common problem among hospice staff. Stress canbe reduced, trust enhanced, and team functioningmore effective if lines of communication are keptopen among all members (medical director throughvolunteer), if information is readily accessible throughstaff conferences and in-service education, and if staffknow they are appreciated and feel good about whatthey are doing. Advance Directives The term advance directive refers to either a living will or a durable power of attorney for health care(also called a health-care proxy). Either document al-lows an individual to provide directions about his orher future medical care. A living will is a written document made by a com- petent individual that provides instructions that shouldbe used when that individual is no longer able to ex-press his or her wishes for health-care treatment. Thedurable power of attorney for health care is a writtenform that gives another person legal power to make de-cisions regarding health care when an individual is nolonger capable of making such decisions. Some stateshave adopted forms that combine the intent of thedurable power of attorney for health care (i.e., to havea proxy) and the intent of the living will (i.e., to statechoices for end-of-life medical treatment). Doctors usually follow clearly stated directives. It is important that the physician be informed that an ad-vance directive exists and what the specific wishes of theclient are. In most states, health-care professionals arelegally bound to honor the client's wishes (Norlander,2008). In 1991, the U.S. Congress passed the Patient Self-Determination Act. This legislation requires that allhealth-care facilities that receive Medicare or Medicaidfunds must advise clients of their rights to refuse treat-ment, to make advance directives available to clients onadmission, and to keep records of whether a client hasan advance directive or a designated health-care proxy(Sadock & Sadock, 2007). Catalano (2012) notes that unless a natural death act has been enacted into law by a state, the living willhas no mechanism of legal enforcement. These laws have been called \"pull the plug\" statues and havevarious names in different states, such as \"Removalof Life Support Systems Act\" (Connecticut), \"NaturalDeath Act\" (Washington), \"Declaration Death Act\" Deci-sion Act\" (Arizona) (Ma ntel, 2013). Catalano (2012) states: In some states, a living will is considered only advisory and the physician has the right to comply with the liv-ing will or treat the client as the physician deemsmost appropriate. There is no protection for nursesor other health care practitioners against criminal orcivil liability in the execution of living wills in stateswithout a natural death act. (p. 155) Norlander (2008, p. 20) suggests the following reasons why advance directives sometimes are not honored: The advance directive is not available at the timetreatment decisions need to be made. This is espe-cially true in emergency situations. The advance directive is not clear. Statements suchas \"no heroic measures\" can be interpreted inmany different ways. The health-care proxy is unsure of the client's wishes. Advance directives allow the client to be in control of decisions at the end of life. It is also a way to sparefamily and loved ones the burden of making choiceswithout knowing what is most important to the per-son who is dying.846 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE Douglas, R., & Brown, H.N. (2002). Patients' attitudes toward advance directives. Journal of Nursing Scholar-ship, 34 (1), 61-65. DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY: This study was conducted to investigate hospitalized patients' attitudes toward advancedirectives. It explored patients' reasons for completing ornot completing advance directive forms, and examined de-mographic differences between patients who did and did not complete advance directive forms. Subjects consistedof a convenience sample of 3 0 hospitalized patients. Cri- teria required that the patients (1) speak English, (2) be atleast 18 years of age, (3) be oriented to time and place,and (4) have been approached by an RN regarding advancedirectives, as documented in the patient chart. Data werecollected over a 3-week period in the oncology and med-ical-telemetry units of a teaching hospital in central NorthCarolina. Interviews were conducted using an adapted ad-vance directive attitude survey (ADAS) in which subjectswere asked five general questions regarding perceptions ofpersonal health, whether they had ever received informationon advance directives, whether they had ever completed anadvance directive, and whether they had ever had a discus-sion with either their primary physician or family members4092_Ch37_830-850 24/07/14 5:37 PM Page 846CHAPTER 37 The Bereaved Individual 847 IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE\u2014 cont'd about end-of-life care. Demographic data were also ob- tained. The tool was based on a 4-point Likert scale from1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Higher scoresindicate more favorable attitudes toward advance directives. RESULTS OF THE STUDY: Subjects ranged in age from 24 to 85 years, with a mean age of 5 7 years. Nineteen were Cau- casian, 10 were African American, and 1 was Hispanic. Ten had completed grade school or junior high, 13 completedhigh school, 4 completed college, and 3 had master's de-grees or beyond. Twelve subjects had been diagnosed withcancer; 5 with respiratory disorders; 4 with sickle cell dis-ease; 3 with cardiac disorders; 2 with vascular disorders;and and dermatological disorders. Twenty-three subjectshad received information on advance directives and 7 saidthey had received no information. Thirteen of the subjectshad completed advance directives and 17 had not. Participants with the highest mean scores were African American, female, aged 35 to 49 years, with a high schooleducation. No subject in the 20 to 30 age group had com-pleted an advance directive, whereas 62 percent of sub-jects over age 65 had done so. The two people with thelowest scores both disagreed with the statement that anadvance directive would make sure that their family knewwhat treatment they desired and they would receive thetreatment they desired. The 13 participants who had completed advance directives cited the following reasonsfor doing so: (a) desire not to be placed on life support, (b) desire to name someone to make decisions in event ofincapacitation, (c) desire to make decisions easier forspouse or family, (d) failing health, and (e) advancing age.The 17 who had not completed advance directives cited thefollowing reasons: (a) keep putting it off, (b) not necessaryat this point in my life, (c) uncomfortable making decisionsabout life support, (d) never heard of advance directives be-fore, (e) form was too long, (f) trust husband to make thosedecisions, and (g) advance directives are unnecessary. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The authors sug- gested that nurses need to explain what advance direc-tives are when asking patients if they have an advancedirective. T hey stated: \"[Nurses] can explore alternative ways to educate patients about advance directives (e.g.,videotape), and follow up with patients who have re-quested information to see if they have additional ques-tions or need assistance completing an advance directive. \" They also suggested that nurses need to inform physicianswhen patients have advance directives. As patient advo-cates, nurses have the responsibility for making sure thatpatients understand the purpose of advance directivesand what is involved in completing an advance directive,and for ensuring that patients' end-of-life care is executedaccording to their wishes. Summary and Key Points Loss is the experience of separation from some- thing of personal importance. Loss is anything that is perceived as such by the individual. Loss of any concept of value to an individual cantrigger the grief response. Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross identified five stages that individuals pass through on their way to resolutionof a loss. These include denial, anger, bargaining,depression, and acceptance. John Bowlby described similar stages that he identi-fied in the following manner: stage I, numbness orprotest; stage II, disequilibrium; stage III, disorgan-ization and despair; and stage IV, reorganization. George Engel's stages include shock and disbelief,developing awareness, restitution, resolution of theloss, and recovery. J. William Worden, a more contemporary clinician,has proposed that bereaved individuals must ac-complish a set of tasks in order to complete thegrief process. These four tasks include acceptingthe reality of the loss, processing the pain of grief,adjusting to a world without the lost entity, andfinding an enduring connection with the lost entityin the midst of embarking on a new life.The length of the grief process is highly individual,and it can last for a number of years without beingmaladaptive. The acute stage of the grief process typically lasts acouple of months, but resolution usually takesmuch longer. K\u00fcbler-Ross suggested that a calendar year of ex-periencing significant events and anniversarieswithout the lost entity may be required. Anticipatory grieving is the experiencing of thefeelings and emotions associated with the normalgrief process in response to anticipation of the loss. Anticipatory grieving is thought to facilitate thegrief process when the actual loss occurs. Three types of pathological grief reactions havebeen described. These include the following: Delayed or inhibited grief in which there is ab-sence of evidence of grief when it ordinarilywould be expected. Distorted or exaggerated grief response in whichthe individual remains fixed in the anger stageof the grief process and all of the symptoms as-sociated with normal grieving are exaggerated. Chronic or prolonged grieving in which the individual is unable to let go of grieving behaviorsafter an extended period of time and in which behaviors are evident that indicate the bereaved 4092_Ch37_830-850 24/07/14 5:37 PM Page 847individual is not accepting that the loss has occurred. Several authors have identified one crucial differ-ence between normal and maladaptive grieving: theloss of self-esteem. Feelings of worthlessness are indicative of depres-sion rather than uncomplicated bereavement. Very young children do not understand death, butoften react to the emotions of adults by becomingmore irritable and crying more. They often believedeath is reversible. School-age children understand the finality ofdeath. Grief behaviors may reflect regression or ag-gression, school phobias, or sometimes a withdrawalinto the self. Adolescents are usually able to view death on an adultlevel. Grieving behaviors may include withdrawal oracting out. Although they understand that their owndeath is inevitable, the concept is so far-reaching asto be imperceptible. By the time a person reaches the 60s or 70s, he orshe has experienced numerous losses. Becausegrief is cumulative, this can result in bereavementoverload. Depression is a common response. Nurses must be aware of the death rituals and griefbehaviors common to various cultures. Some ofthese rituals associated with African Americans, AsianAmericans, Filipino Americans, Jewish Americans,Mexican Americans, and Native Americans were presented in this chapter. Hospice is a program that provides palliative andsupportive care to meet the special needs of peoplewho are dying and their families. The term advance directive refers to either a living will or a durable power of attorney for health care. Ad-vance directives allow clients to be in control of deci-sions at the end of life and spare family and lovedones the burden of making choices without knowingwhat is most important to the person who is dying.848 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.

The needfor mental health-care practitioners will rise as theincreasing number of veterans and their familymembers struggle to cope with their combat-relatedexperiences. This chapter addresses issues associated with the lives of military families and veterans of militarycombat. A discussion of nursing care for these indi-viduals is presented, and selected medical treatmentmodalities are described.4092_Ch38_851-867 25/07/14 10:21 AM Page 851Historical Aspects \"To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan.\" Abraham Lincoln, 1865 There is little doubt that individuals who survive mil-itary combat return from battle with scars\u2014eitherphysical, psychological, or both. Reports of war-related, psychological symptoms have existed in writ-ing throughout the centuries; terms such as \"shellshock\" and \"battle fatigue\" have been used to de-scribe these symptoms. Many veterans of World War Iand World War II were expected to be stoic, to lockup their feelings, and to never speak of the scenes ofcarnage and combat that they had witnessed. Theabuse of alcohol became a common way to deal withthe emotions that they did not feel comfortable dis-cussing. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been related to the high rates of alcoholism amongveterans, particularly those who have experienced ac-tive-duty combat. It has only been in recent historythat the invisible wounds of combat veterans have re-ceived the treatment they desperately require. Very little was written about PTSD during the years between 1950 and 1970. This absence was followed inthe 1970s and 1980s with an explosion in the amountof research and writing on the subject. Many of thepapers written during this time were about Vietnamveterans. Clearly, the renewed interest in PTSD waslinked to the psychological casualties of the VietnamWar. The diagnostic category of PTSD did not appearuntil the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM- III) in 1980, after a need was indicated by increasing numbers of prob-lems with Vietnam veterans and victims of multipledisasters. Epidemiological Statistics There are currently about 1.5 million individualsserving in the U.S. Armed Forces in more than 150countries around the world (USA.gov, 2013). Ap-proximately 15 percent of these are women. Veteranscurrently number 21.8 million, with about 7 percentbeing women. In addition, more than 1 million menand women compose the total of the U.S. Military\"Ready Reserve\" who are members of various compo-nents of the National Guard and U.S. Military Re-serves (Kapp, 2012). The purpose of the Ready Reserve is to \"provide trained units and qualified persons available for active duty in the armed forces,in time of war or national emergency, and at suchother times as the national security may require, tofill the needs of the armed forces whenever moreunits and persons are needed than are in the regularcomponents\" (Title 10 U.S. Code 10102, 2006).Since the beginning of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq in 2001, more than 1.9 million U.S. military per-sonnel have been deployed in 3 million tours of dutylasting more than 30 days as part of Operation Endur-ing Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom(OIF) (Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2012). The costin deaths and physical and psychological injuries can-not be measured. Application of the Nursing Process Assessment The Military Family The military lifestyle offers both positive and negativeaspects to those who choose this way of life. Hall(2011) summarizes a number of pros and cons aboutwhat has come to be known as \"The Warrior Society.\"Some advantages include the following: Early retirement compared to civilian counterparts The security of a vast system to meet family needs Job security with a guaranteed paycheck Health-care benefits Opportunities to see areas of the world Educational opportunities Some disadvantages include the following: Frequent separations and reunions Regular household relocations Living life under the maxim of \"the mission mustalways come first\" A pattern of rigidity, regimentation, and conform-ity in family life Feelings of detachment from nonmilitary community The social effects of \"rank\" The lack of control over pay, promotion, and otherbenefits Mary Wertsch (1996), who conducted a vast amount of research on the culture of the military family, stated,\"The great paradox of the military is that its members,the self-appointed front-line guardians of our cherishedAmerican democratic values, do not live in democracythemselves\" (p. 15). The military is maintained by arigid authoritarian structure, and these characteristicsoften extend into the structure of the home. A class system is strikingly evident in the military, with two distinct subcultures: that of the officer andthat of the enlisted ranks. Hall (2011) states: The United States has made great strides in the past five decades to affirm and equalize the differences insociety, but the assumption of all military systems inthe world is that it is essential for the functioning ofthe organization to maintain a rigid hierarchical sys-tem based on dominance and subordination. (p. 38) Isolation and alienation are common facets of mil- itary life. To compensate for the extreme mobility, the852 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch38_851-867 25/07/14 10:21 AM Page 852focus of this lifestyle turns inward to the military world, rather than outward to the local community.Children of military families almost always report thatno matter what school they attend, they feel \"differ-ent\" from the other students (Wertsch, 1996). These descriptions apply principally to \"career\" military families. There is another type of militaryfamily that has become a familiar part of the Ameri-can culture in recent years. The military campaignsof OEF and OIF together make up the longest sus-tained U.S. military operation since the Vietnam War,and they are the first extended conflicts to depend onan all-volunteer military (IOM, 2012). There has beenheavy dependence on the National Guard and Re-serves, and an escalation in the pace, duration, andnumber of deployments and redeployments experi-enced by these individuals. Many had joined the National Guard or Reserves as a second job for finan-cial reasons or for the educational opportunities avail-able to them. Little thought had been given to thepossibility of actually fighting in a war. As one anony-mous reservist posted on his blog, The active forces have the harder role. They're re- quired to be fully ready 24/7/365, and to deploy andfight on much shorter notice than the Reserve[forces]. It's their livelihood and (for many) their ca-reer. They're serving full-time; reservists aren't. Thatwas once clearly true. But not really quite true any-more. Many reservists in critically-needed specialtieshave already served multiple years on active dutysince 9/11, and this situation doesn't look to changeanytime soon. (\"'Kelly Temps' in Uniform,\" 2012) In recent years, enlistees in the National Guard and Reserves are being told that they should expect to serve an interval of active duty. Most individuals in theNational Guard and Reserves are willing to serve whenand where they are needed. However, they considerthemselves \"part-timers.\" The extended campaigns ofOEF and OIF have changed this part-time concept formany who have served multiple tours of duty, creatinga hardship on their families and their civilian careers.Many of these \"temporary citizen soldiers,\" as well astheir full-time military counterparts, now carry thephysical and psychological scars of battle. Military Spouses and Children A military spouse inherently knows and lives with theconcept of \"mission first.\" Devries, Hughes, Watson,and Moore (2012) state, \"While the military works hardto value the family lives of service members and theirwelfare, the nature of the job is that the mission trumpsall other concerns\" (p. 11). However, times havechanged from the days when life in the military wasviewed as a two-person career, in which a woman wasexpected to \"create the right family setting so that herhusband's work reflected his life at home, by stayingpositive, being interested in his duty, and being flexibleand adaptable\" (Hall, 2012, p. 148). Many of today'smilitary spouses have their own careers or are pursuinghigher levels of education. They do not view the mili-tary as a joint career with their service member spouse. The lives of military spouses and children are clearly affected when the service-member's active dutyassignments require frequent family moves. Wakefield(2007) has stated, \"The many short-term relation-ships, complications of of thechildren, day-care arrangements, spousal loneliness,and increased financial obligations are just some ofthe issues military personnel face that can lead to frus-tration.\" In most instances, when the service memberreceives orders for a new geographical assignment,the spouse's education, career, or both is put on hold,and the entire family is relocated. Other occasionsmay arise when the family is unable to immediatelyfollow the service member to the new location. In cer-tain instances, such as when a student may be aboutto complete a semester or is about to graduate, theservice member may proceed to the new assignmentwithout the family. This is difficult for the militaryspouse who is left alone to care for the children, aswell as to deal with all aspects of the move. Military children face unique challenges. There are 1.9 million children and youth in military families(Department of Defense [DoD], 2012a). They prima-rily attend civilian public schools where they form aunique subculture among staff and peers who oftendo not understand their life experiences. Childrenwho grow up in a career military family learn to adaptto changing situations very quickly and to hide a cer-tain level of fear associated with the nomadic lifestyle.Hall (2008) states: It is not just a fear of what might happen to their fam- ily or their military parents but a fear of the unknown,of not being accepted, of being behind, of not find-ing friends, or of not being cool. One of the mostcommon concerns expressed by students when theyarrive in a new school is who they will eat lunch with.Another reality for student athletes is that a studentcould be the star of the basketball team in one schooland be sitting on the bench at the next. (p. 103) The Impact of Deployment Not since the Vietnam War have so many U.S. military families been affected by deployment-related familyseparation, combat injury, and death. Many servicemembers have been deployed multiple times. Thosewho are deployed most frequently describe theirgreatest fear as that of having to leave their spouseand children. Lengthy separations pose many chal-lenges to all members of the family. Spouses under-take all the challenges of managing the household,CHAPTER 38 Military Families 8534092_Ch38_851-867 25/07/14 10:21 AM Page 853in addition to assuming the role of the singular par- ent. The pressure and stress are intense as the spouseattempts to maintain an atmosphere of strength forthe children, while experiencing the fears and anxietyassociated with the life-threatening conditions facinghis or her service member partner. Approximately 2 million American children have experienced the deployment of a parent to Iraq or Afghanistan. More than 48,000 children have eitherlost a parent or have a parent who was wounded inthese conflicts. Smith (2012) states: The stress that comes when a family member is de- ployed is significant, and that stress is multipliedwhen a loved one is wounded or killed. When parentsreturn from deployment, they are not always thesame as they were before. Major injuries, such as lossof a limb, traumatic brain injury, or posttraumaticstress disorder are life-altering, and children oftenhave a hard time understanding the reason for a sig-nificant change in the appearance, personality, or be-havior of a parent. The following behaviors have been reported in chil- dren in response to the deployment of a parent(American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry,2014): Infants (birth to 12 months): May respond to dis-ruptions in their schedule with decreased appetite,weight loss, irritability, and/or apathy. Toddlers (1 to 3 years): May become sullen, tearful,throw temper tantrums or develop sleep problems. Preschoolers (3 to 6 years): May regress in areassuch as toilet training, sleep, separation fears, phys-ical complaints, or thumb sucking. May assumeblame for parent's departure. School-age children (6 to 12 years): Are moreaware of potential dangers to parent. May exhibitirritable behavior, aggression, or whininess. May be-come more regressed and fearful about parent'ssafety. Adolescents (13 to 18 years): May be rebellious, ir-ritable, or more challenging of authority. Parentsneed to be alert to high-risk behaviors, such asproblems with the law, sexual acting out, and drugor alcohol abuse. Pincus, House, Christenson, and Alder (2013) describethe cycle of deployment stages: prede-ployment, deployment, sustainment, redeployment,and postdeployment. Predeployment The time frame for this stage is variable, beginning with the receipt of the orders and endingwhen the service member departs. Family members alternate with feelings of denial and anticipation ofloss. The soldier and family get their affairs in order , extended training periods result in long hours apart,and the anxiety of the anticipated departure pro-motes stress and irritability among family members. Deployment This stage includes the time from ac- tual deployment through the first month of sepa- ration. Military spouses report feeling disoriented and over whelmed, and experience a range of emo- tions including numbness, sadness, loneliness, andabandonment. It is a time of disorganization as thespouse struggles to take charge of the details of liv-ing without his or her partner. Sustainment Sustainment begins about 1 month into the deployment until about a month before the serv- ice member' s expected return. During this stage, the spouse and children establish new support systems and institute new family routines. Technology makesit possible for the family and service member to keepin touch with each other by phone, video, and e-mail.Despite the difficulties and obstacles encountered,most military families successfully negotiate this stageand anxiously anticipate their loved one's return. Redeployment This stage is defined as the month be- fore the service member is scheduled to return home. There is excitement and apprehension associated with the homecoming. Pincus and associates (2013)identify concerns such as, \"Will he (she) agree withthe changes I have made?\" \"Will I have to give up myindependence?\" \"Will we get along?\" Postdeployment This stage typically lasts 3 to 6 months and begins with the return of the service member to the home station. There is a period of adjustment be- ginning with the \"honeymoon\" period, when thespouses reconnect physically , but not necessarily emo- tionally. The returning service member may desire to\"pick up where he or she left off,\" only to encounterresistance from the spouse who expresses a reluctanceto relinquish the degree of independence and auton-omy to which he or she has become accustomed dur-ing the separation. Pincus and associates (2013) state: Postdeployment is probably the most important stage for both soldier and spouse. Patient communication,going slow, lowering expectations, and taking time toget to know each other again is critical to the task of suc-cessful reintegration of the soldier back into the family. Counseling may be required in the event that the service member has been injured or experiences atraumatic stress reaction. Women in the Military Women make up approximately 15 percent of theU.S. military and 17 percent of National Guard andReserve members (Mathewson, 2011). Women havebeen serving in the military since the time of the CivilWar, mostly in the roles of nurses, spies, and support854 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch38_851-867 25/07/14 10:21 AM Page 854persons. In recent years, the Pentagon relaxed its ban on women serving in combat roles, and \"womenbegan to fly combat aircraft, staff missile placements,drive convoys in the desert, and participate in otherroles that involved potential combat exposure\"(Mathewson, 2011, p. 217). Early in 2013, the Secre-tary of Defense lifted the ban on combat jobs towomen, gradually opening direct combat units to fe-male troops. At the present time, certain specialty positions continue to remain off-limits, although theplan is to integrate women into these positions. Flex-ibility in the new law exists for exemptions to occur iffurther assessment reveals that some jobs are inappro-priate for women. Special Concerns of Women in the Military There are a number of issues of special concern towomen in the military, including sexual harassment,sexual assault, differential treatment and conditions,and being a parent. Sexual Harassment Sexual harassment is defined as \"un- wanted, unwelcome comments or physical contact of a sexual nature occurring in the workplace\" (Mathewson,2011, p. 221). From statements such as \"you look nicethis morning\" or \"hey you smell good\" to blatant sug-gestions or requests for sexual interactions, Wolfe and associates (1998), in a study of women on active dutyduring the Persian Gulf W ar, found that both physical and sexual harassment were higher than those typicallyfound in peacetime military samples. Reports by mili-tary therapists convey that these women who were sexually harassed while in the military suffer high ratesof a range of problems following discharge, includingpoor self-image, relationship problems, drug use, de-pression, and PTSD. Sexual Assault The Department of Defense (DoD, 2012b) reported 2,723 cases of active service member sexual assaults in 2011. Sexual assault is defined as \"at-tempted or completed sexual attack through threator use of physical force that took place on or off dutyduring the course of militar y service\" (Mathewson, 2011, p. 221). It is estimated that only about 13 percentof sexual assaults in the military are reported. Reasonsfor not reporting include fears of causing trouble intheir unit, that their commanders and fellow soldierswould turn against them, that they would be passedover for well-deserved promotions, or that they wouldbe transferred and removed from duty altogether(Vlahos, 2012). Some women who have reported theincident to their commanding officers have been toldto \"forget about it,\" \"buckle up,\" or \"pretend it didn'thappen,\" and are made to feel as though they are theperpetrator instead of the victim. Wolf (2012) de-scribes how the military deals with rape as \"a cultureof cover-up.\"Some women who report their sexual assaults are discharged from the service with psychiatric diag-noses of personality disorder or adjustment disorder.Vlahos (2012) reports: For the veteran, getting a personality disorder or ad- justment disorder discharge can be catastrophic. Notonly does it carry a stigma for future employers, it cutsthe veteran off from a series of benefits, includinghealth care and service-related disability compensation. Although they compose only 15 percent of military per- sonnel, women constitute almost one-fourth of all per-sonality disorder discharges. Survivors of sexual assaultin the military report long-lasting effects, includingPTSD, depression, suicidal ideation and attempts, eat-ing disorders, anxiety disorders, relationship difficulties,and substance abuse. Wolf (2012) notes that, amongmilitary veterans, the leading cause of PTSD for men iscombat trauma, whereas for women it is sexual trauma.She states, \"Our women veterans are more likely to be traumatized by a sexual assault by a fellow soldier, ora commander, than by their own battlefield or war experiences.\" Differential Treatment and Conditions Although their numbers have increased, women still constitute a mi- nority in the military . One female officer accounted that because of the small number of women in anygiven unit, officers and enlisted personnel are oftenhoused together. She indicated that she missed beingwith other officers to discuss work and to be able tospend time with her peers. She also reported that theenlisted women were uncomfortable with an officerin their presence. Women's military careers are often limited by their exclusions from occupational specialties. These sanc-tions often preclude female officers and enlisted per-sonnel from the most prestigious units and occupationsin the military, their participation in which is essentialto ascending in the ranks should they choose to makethe military a career. However, as stated previously,some changes are currently proposed that, when imple-mented, will decrease occupational discriminationagainst women in the military. Parenting Issues Women's feelings associated with leav- ing their children often differ from those of men. Wo men seem to struggle more with guilt feelings for \"abandoning\" their children, whereas men havestronger emotions tied to a sense of doing their duty.Although men also experience regret at leaving theirchildren, they often rely on the assurance that thechildren have their mothers to care for them. Veterans There are 21.8 million veterans in the United States,20.2 million male veterans and 1.6 million female CHAPTER 38 Military Families 8554092_Ch38_851-867 25/07/14 10:21 AM Page 855veterans. Figure 38-1 provides a breakdown by per- centage, according to period of service. Most veterans returning from a combat zone un- dergo a period of adjustment. Although the majoritydo not develop a behavioral health condition, mostwill experience feelings and reactions that may con-tribute to difficulties with their reintegration intocivilian life. Many veterans suffer from migraineheadaches and experience cognitive difficulties, suchas memory loss. Hypervigilance, insomnia, and jitter-iness are common. The Substance Abuse and MentalHealth Services Administration (SAMHSA, 2012)states, \"Veterans may struggle to concentrate; engagein aggressive behavior, such as aggressive driving; anduse alcohol, tobacco, and drugs excessively. However,the intensity and duration of these and other worri-some behaviors can indicate a more serious problemand the need for professional treatment\" (p. 1). Traumatic Brain Injury The Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense(DVA/DoD, 2009, p. 16) offer the following defini-tion of traumatic brain injury (TBI): A traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a resultof an external force that is indicated by new onset orworsening of at least one of the following clinicalsigns, immediately following the event: Any period of loss of or a decreased level of consciousness Any loss of memory for events immediately beforeor after the injury (posttraumatic amnesia) Any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking,etc.) (Alteration of consciousness/mental state)Neurological deficits balance,change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensoryloss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient Intracranial lesion Symptoms may be classified as mild, moderate, or se- vere, according to severity of symptoms. In the civilian population, the most common causes of TBI include child abuse in infants andtoddlers, motor vehicle accidents in adolescentsand young adults, and falls and associated subduralhematomas in older adults (Strong & Donders,2012). Blasts from explosive devices are the leadingcause of TBI for active-duty military personnel incombat (Birk, 2010). TBI also results from pene-trating wounds, severe blows to the head withshrapnel or debris, and falls or bodily collisionswith objects following a blast. Symptoms of TBI according to level of severity are presented in Table 38-1. Most soldiers who have sustained a mild TBI im- prove with no lasting clinical sequelae (DVA/DoD,2009). Many recover within hours to days, or at most,weeks. In a small minority, symptoms persist from 6 months to a year. The location and severity of theinjury are factors that determine the long-term out-come for individuals with TBI. Severity is determinedby the nature, speed and location of the impact, andby complications such as hypoxemia, hypotension, in-tracranial hemorrhage, or pres-sure most common long-term sequelae related to TBI include problems with cognition (e.g., thinking,memory, and reasoning) and behavior or mentalhealth (e.g., depression, anxiety, personality changes,aggression, acting out, and social inappropriateness)856 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations Afghanistan & Iraq (11.6%)World War II (8.5%) Vietnam Era (35%)Korean War (11.3%) Gulf War (16.5%) FIGURE 38-1 Percentage of veterans according to period of service. (Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 20 13).4092_Ch38_851-867 25/07/14 10:21 AM Page 856(Ribbers, 2013). Seizures occur in about 15 to 20 per- cent of individuals with TBI and commonly developwithin the first 24 hours following the injury. Withmild TBI, seizures usually subside within a week afterthe initial trauma. The potential for chronic epilepsyincreases with severity of the injury. Language and communication problems, such as aphasia, dysarthria, and dysphasia, can result from TBI(Safaz, Yasar, Tok, & Yilmaz, 2008). Difficulties mayalso exist in the more subtle aspects of communica-tion, such as body language and nonverbal expression. Studies show that TBI has long-term adverse effects on social functioning and productivity. Temkin, Cor-rigan, Dikmen, and Machamer (2009) stated: Penetrating head injury sustained in wartime is clearly associated with increased unemployment. TBIalso adversely affects leisure and recreation, social re-lationships, functional status, quality of life, and in-dependent living. Although there is a dose-responserelationship between severity of injury and social out-comes, there is insufficient evidence to determine atwhat level of severity the adverse effects are demon-strated. (p. 460) Neurocognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease, are related to TBI (Ribbers, 2013). The risk for AD in individualswith moderate TBI is 2.3 times greater than it is inthe general population. An association betweenParkinson's disease and TBI has also been estab-lished. The disorder may develop years after TBI asa result of damage to the basal ganglia (Ribbers,2013).CHAPTER 38 Military Families 857 TABLE 38-1 Criteria and Symptomatology of Traumatic Brain Injury According to Level of Severity MILD MODERATE SEVERE Criteria Structural imag ing = normal Loss of consciousness 0-3 0 min Alteration of consciousness/ mental state = a moment up to 24 hrs Posttraumatic amnesia = 0-1 day Glascow Coma Scale = 13-15 Symptoms HeadacheDizziness, ringing in the ears Nausea Trouble concentrating, confusion Blurred visionChanges in sleep patterns Mood changes Sensitivity to light or soundCriteriaStructural imaging = normal or abnormalLoss of consciousness >24 hrs Alteration of consciousness/mental state = > 24 hours.

The DVA (2012) provides the follow-ing prevalence estimates: Veterans of OEF and OIF, 11 to 20 percent Gulf War veterans, 10 percent Vietnam veterans, 30 percent The diagnostic criteria for PTSD from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition(DSM-5) (2013) are presented in Chapter 28 of this text. The disorder can occur when an individual is exposed to an accident or violence in which thereis actual or threatened death or serious injury to the self or others. Symptoms of PTSD include thefollowing: Reexperiencing the trauma through flashbacks,nightmares, and intrusive thoughts Intensive efforts to avoid activities, people, places,situations, or objects that arouse recollections ofthe trauma Chronic negative emotional state and diminishedinterest or participation in significant activities Aggressive, reckless, or self-destructive behavior Hypervigilance and exaggerated startle response Angry outbursts, problems with concentration, andsleep disturbances Symptoms of PTSD may be delayed, in some instancesfor years. When emotions regarding the trauma areconstricted, they may suddenly appear at sometimein the future following a major life event, stressor, oran accumulation of stressors with time that challengethe person's defenses. Symptoms also may be maskedby other physical or mental health problems that theveteran may be experiencing. In some instances, thesymptoms do not appear to be problematic until theindividual begins a readjustment to routine occupa-tional or social functioning. Reports indicate that some World War II veterans are only now, decades after returning from combat,being diagnosed with PTSD. At the time of their re-turn, rarely did these veterans speak of their war ex-periences. But in many, the visions of horror haveseeped to the surface in nightmares, flashbacks, anx-iety, and emotional numbness. In a study at the Uni-versity of Michigan, Dr. Helen Kales found that, in agroup of World War II veterans being treated for de-pression, 38 percent of them met the criteria forPTSD (Albrecht, 2009). Langer (2011) reported thatthe PTSD symptoms for these veterans seemed to be-come more prominent in midlife, and that the mostsignificant precipitant was retirement. For many, theirwork gave meaning to their lives, and without it thesymptoms of depression, anxiety, substance abuse,and PTSD began to emerge. Langer (2011) stated: Besides retirement, other precipitants [to PTSD in midlife] include the deaths of friends, one's own de-teriorating health, children becoming autonomous,divorce, and other losses associated with aging. Otherprecipitants include current events that trigger mem-ories of one's own combat experience, e.g., 9/11, andother wars. Veterans with PTSD experience marital and rela- tionship difficulties, including higher rates of physical and verbal aggression against their partners and chil-dren and higher rates of divorce (Monson, Fredman,& Adair, 2008). The burden of caregiving to a partnerwith PTSD has been noted as an etiological factor inrelationship difficulties. The caregiver's perception ofhow caring for the impaired partner affects their social life, health, or financial status is directly associ-ated with the degree of difficulty experienced in therelationship (Lavender & Lyons, 2012). Some care-givers may experience what has been termed as secondary trauma or vicarious traumatization , a condition in which somatic symptoms and emotional distressoccur as a response to caring for an individual whoexhibits the symptoms of PTSD. Secondary symptomsare also common in children with a parent sufferingfrom PTSD. Figley (1998) suggested that family mem-bers \"experience emotions that are strikingly similarto the victim's. This includes visual images (e.g., flash-backs), sleeping problems, depression, and othersymptoms that are a direct result of visualizing the victim's traumatic experiences, exposure to the symp-toms of the victim, or both\" (pp. 20-21). Co-occurring disorders are common in individuals with PTSD, including major depressive disorder, sub-stance use disorders, and anxiety disorders. Individu-als with TBI also may develop PTSD, depending onthe degree of amnesia experienced immediately fol-lowing the cerebral trauma. Depression and Suicide The most recent statistics by SAMHSA indicated that9.3 percent of U.S. veterans between ages 21 and 39experienced at least one major depressive episodein the year prior to the survey (SAMHSA, 2012). Thesurvey indicated that female veterans are twice aslikely as their male counterparts to suffer from de-pression. The disorder affects 14.8 million U.S.adults annually, and veterans account for slightlymore than 14 percent of the total (National Allianceon Mental Illness [NAMI], 2009). Impairments areobserved in the domains of home management, interpersonal relationships, and occupational andsocial functioning.858 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations4092_Ch38_851-867 25/07/14 10:21 AM Page 858Reports by the DoD and VA indicate that the num- ber of suicides among veterans and active-duty mili- tary has risen dramatically since 2001, the year thatdetailed record-keeping began. Suicide among mili-tary personnel is closely associated with the diagnosesof substance use disorder, major depressive disorder,PTSD, and TBI. A common theme among investiga-tions of suicide attempts and completed suicides bymilitary service members is marital/relationship dis-tress. Devries and associates (2012) stated: From 2005 to 2009, relationship problems were a fac- tor in over 50 percent of the suicides in the Army.The health of our military fighting force is directlyrelated to the health of our military marriages. Whatwe see in the military is a common drama of relation-ship problems played out in an environment of un-common stressors. (p. 7) A study by Jakupcak and associates (2010) concluded that veterans who are unmarried or those who reportlower satisfaction with their social support networksare at increased risk for suicide. Substance Use Disorder Substance use disorder is a common co-occurringcondition with PTSD. One study reports that almost22 percent of veterans with PTSD also receive a diag-nosis of substance use disorder (Brancu, Straits-Troster, & Kudler, 2011). SAMHSA (2012) states thatalcohol misuse and abuse, hazardous drinking, andbinge drinking are common among OEF and OIF vet-erans, who often report drinking to numb the agoniz-ing feelings and erase the painful memories relatedto their combat experiences. One research study ofOIF veterans indicated that individuals who were ex-posed to extreme violence and human trauma weremore likely to engage in frequent and heavy drinkingthan their counterparts who had less exposure tosuch combat experiences (Killgore et al., 2008). Substance abuse continues to be a major concern for the military. Although there have been reductions overtime in tobacco use and illicit drug use, increases inother areas, such as prescription drug abuse and heavyalcohol use, are an ongoing problem. Alcohol abuse isthe most prevalent problem, and referrals for treatmentare inadequate (National Institute on Drug Abuse[NIDA], 2011). NIDA (2011) reports, \"Research find-ings highlight the need to improve screening and ac-cess to care for alcohol-related problems among servicemembers returning from combat deployments\"(p. 1). Diagnosis/Outcome Identification Nursing diagnoses are formulated from the data gath-ered during the assessment phase and with back-ground knowledge regarding predisposing factors tothe disorder. Table 38-2 presents a list of selectedclient behaviors and the NANDA nursing diagnosesthat correspond to those behaviors, which may be used in planning assistance for families as they CHAPTER 38 Military Families 859 TABLE 38-2 Nursing Diagnoses: Planning Care for Military Families RISK FACTORS/ DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS NURSING DIAGNOSES OUTCOME CRITERIA Risk for other-directed violence Risk for suicide Post-trauma syndrome related to having experienced the trauma of military combat Ineffective coping; ineffective denialPTS D Rage reactions, aggression, irritability, substance use, flashbacks, star tle reaction Depression, perception of lack of social support, physical disabilitiesfrom combat injuries, feelings ofhopelessness Anger, aggression, depression, difficulty concentrating, flashbacks, guilt,headaches, hypervigilance, intrusivethoughts and dreams, nightmares,emotional numbness, panic attacks,substance abuse Substance abuseClient will demonstrate appropriate coping behaviors.

Outcome criteria are presented for each. Planning/Implementation/Evaluation Nurses provide care for service members, veterans, andtheir families in a variety of settings, including generalhospitals, VA hospitals, community health centers, doc-tors' offices, long-term care centers, and community-based clinics. The care required by the veteransreturning from combat in the war on terrorism is com-plex and multifaceted. War-related physical injuries areoften striking and conspicuous in their visibility. How-ever, it is the veteran's invisible injuries with which psychiatric/mental health nurses are most often calledupon for treatment. The need for nurses to providecare for the increasing number of veterans with theseinvisible injuries is intensifying, and the DVA continuesto search for more effective ways to ensure that militaryveterans and families receive the care that they desper-ately need and deserve. In some instances, this meansadditional medical skills training for psychiatric nursesin an effort to prepare them for the \"polytrauma needsof veterans\" (Wynn & Sherrod, 2010). Interventions for a selected number of nursing di- agnoses relevant to veterans and military families arepresented in Table 38-3. Evaluation is conducted byreassessing to determine if the nursing actions havebeen successful in meeting the outcome criteria. CHAPTER 38 Military Families 861 TABLE 38-3 Nursing Interventions for Veteran Clients and Military Families Post-trauma syndrome (PTSD) Risk for suicide (PTSD, TBI) Disturbed thought processes (TBI) Interrupted family processes (PTSD; TBI)Stay with the client during periods of flashbacks and nightmares and offer reassurance of personal safety. Encourage the client to talk about the traumatic experience at his or her own pace. Discuss maladaptive coping mechanisms being employed. Assist the client in his or her effort to use more adaptive strategies. Include available support systems, and make referrals for additional assistance where required.Help client understand that use of substances merely numbs feelings and delays healing. Refer for treatment of substance use disorder. Discuss use of stress-management techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, relax- ation, and exercise. Administer medications as prescribed, and provide medication education. Assess degree of risk according to seriousness of threat, existence of a plan, and availabil- ity and lethality of the means. Ask directly if person is thinking of acting on thoughts or feelings. Ascertain presence of significant others for support.Determine whether substance use is a factor.Encourage expression of feelings, including appropriate expression of anger.Ensure that environment is safe.Help client identify more appropriate solutions and offer hope for the future.Negotiate a short-term no-suicide contract. (Some clinicians question the effectiveness of this intervention; however, it has proved successful with some individuals.) Involve family/significant others in the planning. Evaluate mental status, including extent of impairment in thinking ability; remote and re- cent memory; orientation to person, place, and time; insight and judgment; changes in personality; attention span, distractibility, and ability to make decisions or problem-solve;ability to communicate appropriately; anxiety level; evidence of psychotic behavior . Report to physician any cognitive changes that become obvious. Note behavior indicative of potential for violence and take appropriate action to prevent harm to client and others. Provide safety measures as required. Institute seizure precautions if indicated. Assist with limited mobility issues. Monitor medication regimen.Refer to appropriate rehabilitation providers. Encourage the importance of continuous, open communication between family members to facilitate ongoing problem-solving. Assist the family to identify and use previously successful coping strategies. Encourage family participation in multidisciplinary team conference or group therapy. Continued4092_Ch38_851-867 25/07/14 10:21 AM Page 861Treatment Modalities Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Psychosocial Therapies Cognitive therapy, prolonged exposure therapy, group and family therapy, and eye movement desensitizationand reprocessing have all been used successfully in thetreatment of PTSD. These therapies are discussed atlength in Chapter 28 of this text. Psychopharmacology The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)are now considered first-line treatment of choice forPTSD because of their efficacy, tolerability, and safetyratings. Other antidepressants that have also been ef-fective include trazadone, the tricyclics amitriptylineand imipramine, and the MAO inhibitor phenelzine.Benzodiazepines are sometimes prescribed for theiranti-panic effects, although their addictive propertiesmake them less desirable. Antihypertensives, such aspropranolol and clonidine, have been successful in al-leviating symptoms such as nightmares, intrusive rec-ollections, hypervigilance, insomnia, startle responses,and angry outbursts. Complementary Therapies Acupuncture has been used successfully as an adjunc-tive therapy for individuals with PTSD. Relaxationtechniques have been shown to alleviate symptoms 862 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations TABLE 38-3 Nursing Interventions for Veteran Clients and Military Families\u2014cont'd Risk for complicated grieving (family of deployed service member) Caregiver role strain (spouse/caregiver of injured service member)Involve family in social support and community activities of their interest and choice. Encourage use of stress-management techniques.Make necessary referrals (e.g., Parent Effectiveness, specific disease or disability support groups, self-help groups, clergy, psychological counseling, or family therapy). Assist family to identify situations that may lead to fear or anxiety.Involve family in mutual goal-setting to plan for the future.Identify community agencies from which family may seek assistance (e.g., Meals on Wheels, visiting nurse, trauma support group, American Cancer Society, Veterans Administration). Help family members to realize that all of the feelings they are having are a normal part of the grieving process. Validate their feelings of anger, loneliness, fear, powerlessness, dysphoria, and distress at separation from their loved one. Help parent to understand that children's and adolescents' problematic behaviors are symptoms of grieving, and that they should not be deemed unacceptable and result inpunishment, but rather be recognized as having their basis in grief. Children should be allowed an appropriate amount of time to grieve. Some experts be- lieve children need at least four weeks to adjust to a parent's deployment (Gabany &Shellenbarger, 2010). Refer for professional help if improvement is not observed in areasonable period of time. Assess if maladaptive coping strategies, such as substance abuse, are being used. Identify and encourage clients to employ previously used successful coping strategies.Encourage resuming involvement in usual activities.Caution against spending too much time alone.Suggest keeping a journal of experiences and feelings.Refer to other resources, as needed, such as psychotherapy, family counseling, religious references or pastor, or grief support group. Assess the spouse/caregiver's ability to anticipate and fulfill the injured service member's unmet needs. Provide information to assist the caregiver with this responsibility. Ensure that the caregiver encourages the injured service member to be as independent as possible. Encourage the caregiver to express feelings and to participate in a support group.Provide information or demonstrate techniques for dealing with acting out, violent, or dis- oriented behavior by the injured service member. Identify additional needs and ensure that resources are provided (e.g., physical therapy, occupational therapy, nutritionist, financial and legal help, and respite care). Assess for abuse of substances as a coping strategy.Refer to counseling or psychotherapy as needed.4092_Ch38_851-867 25/07/14 862associated with physiological hyperreactivity, and hyp- nosis may be helpful for symptoms such as pain, anxi-ety, dissociation, and nightmares (Brancu et al., 2011). Traumatic Brain Injury Type of care for the client with TBI depends on sever-ity of the injury and area of the brain involved.Brancu and associates (2011) state, \"Since 90 percentof patients have mild cases and experience full recov-ery, early intervention involving education and a focuson recovery is strongly recommended\" (p. 59). Psychosocial Therapies Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shownto be helpful to individuals with TBI. Scorer (2013)states, \"An advantage of [CBT] interventions is that,given their highly structured content, they areamenable to specialized adaptation for memory, at-tention, and problem solving impairments, reflectingthe difficulties people with TBI often experience.\"Other therapies, such as prolonged exposure therapy,may also work well for veterans with mild TBI andemotional trauma (Brancu et al., 2011). Rehabilitation Therapies Rehabilitation therapy is multifaceted and determinedby severity and location of the brain damage. Special-ists in the care of the individual with TBI may includeany or all of the following (Mayo Clinic, 2012): Physiatrist. A physician trained in the medical spe- cialty of physical medicine and rehabilitation. Thisphysician oversees other professionals involved inthe rehabilitation process. Occupational Therapist. Helps the individual learn, relearn, or improve skills for everyday living. Physical Therapist. Assists the veteran with mobility and relearning movement patterns, balance, andwalking. Recreational Therapist. Assists with leisure activities. Speech and Language Pathologist. Helps the per- son improve communication skills and use assistivecommunication devices, if necessary. Neuropsychologist or psychiatrist. Helps the vet- eran manage behaviors or learn coping strategies,provides talk therapy as needed for emotional andpsychological well-being, and prescribes medica-tion as needed. Social Worker or Case Manager. Coordinates accessto services, assists with care decisions and planning,and facilitates communication among various pro-fessionals, care providers, and family members. Psychopharmacology Medications for the individual with TBI are given toameliorate specific symptoms. Antidepressants areprescribed for depression, which is very prevalent inindividuals with TBI. SSRIs are commonly the antide-pressants others,such as venlafaxine, and du-loxetine, are also used. Benzodiazepines or SSRIs maybe administered for treatment of anxiety symptoms,and antipsychotics are prescribed if aggression, agita-tion, or psychotic behaviors occur. Anticonvulsantsare given if seizures are a problem, and the physicianmay prescribe skeletal muscle relaxants for musclespasms or spasticity. Methylphenidate or modafinilhas been used to treat attention deficits and hyperac-tivity, and donepezil has been shown to be effectivein enhancing cognitive performance of individualswith TBI (Foster & Spiegel, 2008). Summary and Key Points There are about 1.5 million individuals serving inthe U.S. Armed Forces in more than 150 countriesaround the world. Veterans currently number 21.8 million. Since the beginning of the wars in Afghanistan andIraq in 2001, more than 1.9 million U.S. militarypersonnel have been deployed in 3 million toursof duty. The military lifestyle offers both positive and neg-ative aspects to those who choose this way of life. To compensate for the extreme mobility, the focusof the military lifestyle turns inward to the militaryworld, rather than outward to the local community. In the OEF and OIF campaigns, there has beenheavy dependence on the National Guard and Re-serves, and an escalation in the pace, duration, andnumber of deployments and redeployments expe-rienced by these individuals. Military families face unique challenges, includingfrequent moves and many separations. Children and adolescents exhibit a number ofproblematic behaviors in response to the separa-tion from a deployed parent. The cycle of deployment is described in five dis-tinct stages: predeployment, deployment, sustain-ment, redeployment, and postdeployment. Special concerns of women in the military includesexual harassment, sexual assault, differential treat-ment and conditions, and issues related to being aparent. Although the majority do not develop a behavioralhealth condition, most veterans returning from acombat zone experience feelings and reactionsthat may contribute to difficulties with their rein-tegration into civilian life. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological CHAPTER 38 Military Families 8634092_Ch38_851-867 25/07/14 10:21 AM Page 863disruption of brain function as a result of an exter- nal force to the head. Symptoms of TBI are related to the severity of the in-jury and the area of the brain that has been injured. The most common long-term sequelae related toTBI include problems with cognition and behavioror mental health. PTSD is the most common mental disorder amongveterans returning from military combat. Symptoms of PTSD may occur shortly after thetrauma, or they may be delayed, in some instancesfor years. Depression among military veterans is quite com-mon, and suicide rates among veterans and servicemembers have continued to rise.Substance use disorder is a common co-occurringcondition with PTSD. Nursing care of military families and veterans ispresented in the context of the six steps of thenursing process. Treatment modalities for PTSD and TBI includepsychosocial com-plementary therapies, and rehabilitation therapies.864 UNIT 5 Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing of Special Populations Additional info available at www.davisplus.com Review Questions Self-Examination/Learning Exercise Select the answer that is most appropriate for each of the following questions. 1.
