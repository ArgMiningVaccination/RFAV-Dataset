My dad was a Chiropractor, Oriental Medical Doctor and Physical Therapist. He integrated the latest in biochemistry and functional medicine with variety of esoteric methods. He was well ahead of his time using laser therapy, color therapy, ear acupuncture and Applied Kinesiology. His practice benefited patients with complex health care needs and world class athletes. I was raised on the Belgium coast with good local food and healthy dose of daily vitamins, herbs and homeopathy. As a child, I suffered from asthma, allergies and eczema and was treated by a Medical Doctor who specialized in Classical Homeopathy. This treatment changed everything for me \u2014it was an experience that improved my heath and would make an even greater impact later in life shaping my career as a doctor. After completing my Pre-Medical studies at Richmond College in London, England, I moved to the United States and attended the National College of Chiropractic in Chicago. I soon realized there was a lot to learn within the field of Chiropractic and took every opportunity to advance my knowledge in Applied Kinesiology (A.K.) and studied with Dr. Wally Smith D.C. and George Goodheart D.C. the inventor of A.K. I was inspired by the work of Dr. Earl Column D.C for Magnet Therapy and Dr.Craig Hilgendorf D.C. for Clinical Kinesiology. I advanced my education with Dietrich Klinghardt M.D for Autonomic Response Testing and studied biological medicine with Dr.Thomas Rau MD who is one of the world's most recognized physicians in the field of biological medicine Homeopathy When I learned that a Homeopathic Pharmacy dating back to the time of Dr. James Tyler Kent, Master Homeopath (1800) was still in operation in Chicago, I studied every book on the shelf! My Classical Homeopathic training started with Andre Saine ND ,DC and Francisco Xavier Eizyaga MD. With more seminars on the West Coast I was fortunate to advance my study with the great masters of our time including Ananda Zaren ,Roger Morrison MD, Jan Sholten MD, Massimo Mangliavori, MD and Rajan Sankaran. Naturopathic Medicine The National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland Oregon had the largest homeopathic library in the country so after a few years into my practice, I went back to school to become a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine. Functional Medicine I started studying Functional Medicine led by Jeffrey Bland in 1991. Functional medicine was a brand new field and I was there at the beginning, along with my father from Belgium. Functional Medicine made it possible to apply all the biochemistry I learned in school in the best way to help my patients. It allowed me to expand my understanding of how diet, supplementation and botanical extracts can modify cell function right down to genetic expression. D.r Luc Maes B.S., D.C., N.D.
