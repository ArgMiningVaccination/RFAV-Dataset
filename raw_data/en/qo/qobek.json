It's been shown to ease depression, improve mental function, and reduce stress and anxiety. Did you know it also reduces thought patterns or attachments to negative feelings that actually influence our physical chemistry? Meditation quiets the the constant, undirected thinking that often brings anxiety, worry, and distraction into our everyday lives. Even taking five minutes to practice meditation can bring us back into the present moment, encourage better decision-making, and allow us to truly experience our lives to the fullest. What if you've never meditated before? This simple guide will explain how to start. MEDITATION FOR CLEANSING THE MIND AND BODY Step 1: Start Small It's a common misconception that you need to be a meditation master to see any positive effect or change in your life. That's simply not true. We suggest starting small, even as little as two minutes can be helpful in learning how to clear your mind. Also, as you see the positive results such a short time can bring, you will be more inclined to make time for this important activity. Step 2: Prescription for Meditation Today many people find when the first solution offered when experiencing anxiety, stress or depression is a prescription. While there is a need for this in some cases, it can also be a band-aid for a problem that we can begin to work on ourselves, or use in conjunction with necessary medications to work more effectively. There are also many natural remedies to reducing anxiety that actually work. Step 3: Learn the Basics Fear is a large inhibitor when it comes to trying new things. What if I do it wrong? What if I'm not good at it? Take the fear out by familiarizing yourself with the basic goals of a regular meditation practice and then realize that practice is just that: practice. No one is 100% right all the time. Step 4: Find Your Own Way Have you ever heard \"rules are made to be broken\"? Once you learn the principles and goals of meditation, you can adjust this to whatever works for you. The best practice is the one we will actually do, so maybe for you it's a completely different style or goal than what would work for someone else. Stick with it and make adjustments as you go. Step 5: Quiet the Mind When you sit down to practice, you might notice you start remembering things and feel the urge to act on them. This is part of the process. When those thoughts come and try to steal your attention away from your body, simply say silently to yourself, \"Thank you for sharing,\" and direct your attention back to your body. Meditation causes us to relax more easily, which has been shown to slow the aging process. By redirecting our attention to our body and breath, we reclaim that wasted energy. It may be hard to remember to do this in difficult situations. Start with easy ones and go from there. When you become more present, others in the room feel it as well. Practicing meditation and being present will help you in all aspects. You will begin to be able to use your energy and attention to stay present and be more productive. This practice will also help you be more aware of the decisions you are making. You will naturally feel drawn to making healthier decisions for yourself. Practicing meditation is a great way to help clean the mind, body, and strengthen your ability to breathe easily and be happier throughout the rest of your day.
