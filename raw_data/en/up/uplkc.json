Many hospitality and tourism degrees are found within departments of business which provide technical experience but lack interpersonal or interdisciplinary components. 24The proposed degree focuses on domestic and international hospitality and travel. In doing so, we are preparing students to successfully work in any of these settings as employees or employers with the capability to show cultural competence as well as strong leadership skills. Both concentrations proposed for the degree are vastly different than what is offered by any other degree in the United States. While gastronomic tourism can be found as training programs and curriculum in Europe, there is no program solely focused on this aspect of tourism in the United States. The goal of creating this type of program in Kentucky is to increase and support local industry from hotels to the bourbon trail to local foods. Likewise, the Gastronomic Tourism University Certificate includes the same courses as the concentration and students choose nine hours from the degree program to support their learning. The sustainable hospitality concentration is also interdisciplinary. The courses offered within this concentration, while not unique to the United States, are unique to Kentucky. The United Nations hosted a Sustainable Development Summit in 2015 and endorsed a 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Within this agenda are three main dimensions which include economic, social, and environmental sustainable development. This concentration meets the needs of hospitality industries around the world seeking to meet the goals outlined in this Agenda. The Sustainable Hospitality University Certificate requires the same courses as those offered in the concentration in addition to nine hours chosen from the degree program.

No additional education or credentials are required for positions. Comparison of Objectives/Focus/Curriculum to Similar Programs: University of Kentucky (CIP 52.0901 ), College of Agriculture, Bachelor of Science in Hospitality Management and Tourism. The degree at the University of Kentucky follows the business and management course requirements of many hospitality and tourism management degrees. It does not provide concentrations or certificates for students who wish to specialize or work in non-traditional venues like agritourism, sustainable tourism, or gastrotourism. Furthermore, the is less emphasis on global hospitality and tourism sectors. Western Kentucky University (CIP 52.0901 ), College of Health and Human Services, Department of Applied Human Sciences, Bachelor of Science in Hospitality Management and Dietetics Major, and Hotel, Restaurant, and Tourism Management Concentration. The program offered at Western Kentucky University is found in the same department as the proposed degree at EKU. Since the degree is offered as part of the dietetics major, graduates are more likely to focus on business and restaurant management courses. Therefore, it does not overlap with the goals for preparing students to work in the hospitality and tourism industries around the world that are highlighted in the proposed program at EKU. Sullivan University (CIP 52.0903 ), Associate of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management, Associate of Science in Event Management and Tourism, and Bachelor of Science in Hospitality Management. These programs prepare students for a small sector of the hospitality and tourism industry by providing business and food/beverage courses.

The associate of science degree in event management and tourism is offered face-to-face in Louisville, KY. The associate of science in hotel and restaurant management and the bachelor of science degree are offered online and face-to-face. Comparison of Student Populations: The University of Kentucky and Western Kentucky University do not have an online program for Hospitality Management, whereas Sullivan University, a private institution, has an online Hospitality Management program. The Hospitality Management program at Sullivan University is well advertised. At Sullivan University, to obtain a bachelor ' s degree in hospitality management, a total of 180 academic credits are required, which is more hours when compared with other institutions. The programs at UK and WKU are primarily focused on business courses with a focus on restaurant or food management. While our proposed degree and concentrations will also include these components, students will focus on topics that are the future of the hospitality and tourism industry. For example, our program will offer components of global sustainability and sociocultural impacts of hospitality and tourism. The gastronomic tourism concentration does provide food and beverage topics similar to the other state institutions, but from a global perspective. The sustainable hospitality concentration focuses on increasing awareness of critical environmental and social issues that are increasingly important in the industry. Access to Existing Programs: Within the state of Kentucky, hospitality programs are primarily delivered on campus. Throughout the nation, a variety of delivery formats exist. However, there are few programs available nationwide or globally that include an emphasis in gastronomic tourism and sustainable hospitality. Currently there are less than five undergraduate sustainable hospitality degrees across the nation and only one undergraduate degree specializing in food tourism (gastronomic tourism). Feedback from Other Institutions: Feedback from the University of Kentucky was supportive and they are interested in future collaborations. We have also received positive feedback with Western Kentucky University and have scheduled digital meetings in the future. 27Cost Projected Revenue over Next Five Years ($) : 2705535 Projected Expenses over Next Five Years ($) : 2054094 Will Additional faculty be needed? Yes Initial course development and delivery for the first year of the program will be provided by existing faculty in EKU ' s Department of Applied Human Sciences. In addition students will be able to complete supporting coursework from existing programs. During the first year it will be necessary to hire one faculty member to support the program ' s course offerings, and a second faculty member is expected to be added in year two of the program. As with all of our other online programs, faculty positions will be paid from program tuition revenues generated from new and existing student enrollments. Provide a budgetary rationale for creating this new program This program will attract new students to the major as projected, and it is expected that demand for the hospitality and tourism courses will be high from students in other majors who choose the courses as electives or as part of the exploratory journey many students take. 28PROPOSED PROGRAM SUMMARY Instituion: Eastern Kentucky University Program Name: Instructional Design and Learning Technology Degree Designation: MASTER OF SCIENCE (MS) Degree Level : Master's Program Description The Instructional Design and Learning Technology (IDLT) Master ' s Degree is designed to confer job readiness skills bound by applied theoretical frameworks related to the fields of instructional and eLearning design, corporate training, and performance management. The core of the program consists of courses that will help the student to master instructional design, to analyze and make data-driven decisions, and afford them an opportunity for in-house or external internships. At the same time, students are afforded choices among various electives to fulfill the course requirements. In short, these are divided into the following broad categories: a. Multimedia Design for Learning: Provides a professional foundational understanding of the research and development of multimedia elements to positively improve learning outcomes. b. Graphic/User Interface Design: Use of typography, symbol systems, color, and space to create intuitive electronic interfaces as well as communicate instructional messages clearly and effectively. c. Online distance learning: Provides historical context and modern approaches to online learning through use of tools, techniques, and best practices. Internship Requirement Because the proposed program will focus on career readiness, we devised a three- dimensional, proactive approach to providing students instructional design experience with maximum flexibility in mind to meet the needs of a diverse student population. A. Internal placement at EKU. Students work as academic instructional designers at the EKU Instructional Design Center (IDC) in support of the mission and goals of the university. Students may intern with the IDC remotely when they have a reliable, high speed internet connection. B. External placement. Students complete an internship in an organization identified by IDLT program coordinators with whom the student has no prior affiliation. Alternately, students may find their own placement with department approval. Remote internships will be at the discretion of the respective employer, but EKU will take significant steps to find remote positions for students who are firmly location-bound where there is not an immediate employment need, such as a rural or low population density area. C. External placement in student ' s workplace. Students complete an internship at their current workplace where they are already gainfully employed, but not as a trainer, instructional designer, or in a related capacity. Portfolio Requirement While conducting research for this program, we did not identify any other program in the state that integrates portfolio artifacts into their curriculum. As a normal part of IDLT coursework, students will create a series of portfolio \" artifacts, \" or elements demonstrating their growing abilities and accomplishments. These are significant 29products that may consist of complete instructional units, training programs, multimedia products, needs analysis and program evaluation reports, and other creations pertinent to instructional design. Whatever the future may bring, the field of instructional design and learning technologies is poised to grow to meet the demands of an ever-changing workforce (Finn & Conway, 2019 ). These changes will be especially evident as universities redefine and redesign the educational experience to offer greater flexibility, student choice, and to remove obstacles in the educational process (Miaoulis, 2020 ). Will this program replace or enhance any existing programs(s) or tracks, concentrations, or specializations within an existing program? If yes, please specify This program will not replace or enhance any existing program(s) or tracks, concentrations, or specializations within an existing program. CIP Code: 13.0501 Credit Hours: 30 Institutional Board Approval Date: 12/10/2020 Implementation Date: 8/23/2021 Student Demand Year 1 - 177 Year 2 - 255 Year 3 - 255 Year 4 - 255 Year 5 - 255 Market Demand Student Demand Year 1 - 177 Year 2 - 459 Year 3 - 449 Year 4 - 449 Year 5 - 449 Market Demand The EKU IDLT Program seeks to address the need for qualified Instructional Designers, Instructional Coordinators (Bureau of Labor Statistics designation), and Training and Development Specialists across the state and beyond. It is a need primarily driven by the rise of distance education and online learning initiatives (McFarland et al., n.d.). Recent shifts in both public and private sectors, including P- 20 institutions, have seen increased demand for online instructional delivery even before the ongoing SARS- CoV- 2 pandemic. Extraordinary circumstances resulting from SARS-CoV- 2 have further catalyzed rapid organizational change regarding the structure and delivery of work. Instructional designers and trainers have long held expertise leveraging appropriate, effective technology using evidence-based approaches to design and deliver effective instruction across myriad settings. They became essential contributors responsible for significant efforts toward implementation and operation of training and education. 30The IDLT program adds to current offerings in Kentucky. However, the proposed EKU program is differentiated because our coursework blends theoretical and practical concepts toward a unique focus on early career application and orientation, as well as a mandatory intensive cooperative/internship placement engaging students in impactful work. Students will additionally create and maintain their own professional web site portfolio that will effectively and succinctly communicate their mastery of the skills and knowledge required for today ' s working professionals. We believe this experience will better prepare students for the competitive job market starting with their very first course, a strategy not seen in other programs in the state or region. Successful students in this program will be job-ready upon graduation, if not before. Program Justification, Student Demand, and Careers on The National Level Instructional Design Paces with Market According to the market research reports by Finn and Conway ( 2019 ) and Plotnik and Hinck ( 2019 ), national job opportunities for Master ' s-level instructional design professionals from September 2016 to July 2019 grew 123 percent (Figure 1 ). This growth mirrors other careers for which the master ' s degree is generally required (Figure 1 ). Growth At Least Fast as Average The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics ( 2020 ) suggests trainers, training development managers, fields for which Instructional designers are well-suited, will experience faster than average growth over the projected time frame 2018 to 2028 . The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics ( 2020 ) projects Instructional designers and instructional coordinator jobs will grow at an average rate over the same time period. Another report by Thornton and Donohue ( 2017 ) reported significant increases ( 52 percent) in demand at the national level for bachelor ' s and master ' s level instructional design professionals between February 2018 and June 2018 (Figure 2 ). Regional Dearth of Interest and Mitigation At the same time, the EAB ( 2019 ) market pulse check for online masters-level programs in Instructional Design for central Kentucky (including a 150 -mile radius of Wilmore, KY, including Lexington, Louisville, and Cincinnati) does not suggest favorable program potential. However, trends identified by Finn and Conway ( 2019 ), Plotnik and ( 2017 ) suggest that in order to mitigate potential dearth of program demand, institutions should focus on the recruitment of students at the national level while also offering an orientation toward practical, job-focused learning outcomes which prepare students for immediate, direct- entry into the workplace. EKU ' s Instructional Design and Learning Technology program seeks to immediately prepare students for gainful employment by having terminal objectives culminate in deliverables suitable for inclusion in professional portfolios. Additionally, the program will directly place students into practicum experiences valued by hiring organizations. 31Regional State National Type Of Job Instructional Coordinator Avg.

As the program is part of UK ' s College of Education, there is also a synergy with the needs of K- 12 teachers and teacher educators. The UK program is multifaceted and serves multiple needs, primarily within the university and local region. The primary objective of the proposed EKU program is singular: to prepare individuals for gainful employment in industry, particularly settings outside public school organizations. Additionally, EKU seeks to target populations outside the regular service regions of state institutions. Western Kentucky University Comparing the proposed curriculum with the MS in Instructional Design at Western Kentucky University, EKU ' s IDLT program offers additional courses to prepare students to be effective instructional designers. Namely, there is an additional focus on: 1 . Making data driven decisions which include needs analysis and program and training evaluation (IDL 802 , 814 , PSY 790 ) 2 learning experiences (IDL 814 ) 3 . Catering to diverse learning populations (IDL 813 ) 4 . Developing visually appealing instructional products (DES 850 ) 5 . Design and production of design spaces when designing a new user interaction (DES 851 ) 6 . Emphasizing the need for technical writing (ENG 840 ) 7 . Development of professional portfolio which students will develop throughout the program and showcase to their future employers Comparison of Student Populations: While the mission of state institutions is to serve the citizens of their respective service regions, EKU ' s IDLT program will also strive to recruit and serve students across the country and from diverse disciplinary backgrounds. Many master ' s degree programs out of tradition and practicality accept students who are academically prepared at the baccalaureate level in their specific discipline. The IDLT program may accept graduates from any academic discipline due to the nature of the field. Moreover, we would specifically also seek to target P-12 teachers who have left the profession. Students with the disposition and skill set to be effective classroom teachers have much to offer the instructional design field and have applicable training that would benefit both themselves and organizations. Access to Existing Programs: EKU ' s proposed IDLT program is keenly focused on preparing students with 21 - century skills to enter organizations as critical and creative thinkers ready to solve instructional problems. At the same time, we acknowledge the University of Kentucky ' s College of Education (UKCOE) has expertise and an approach which orients students toward a broad theoretical perspective on learning and professional development. We would be open to any partnership which allows a student to maximize their choice relative to fulfilling their own learning and career goals. Although there is no current collaborative arrangement, potential EKU faculty have contacts with UKCOE and would be willing to explore a partnership in the future. The knowledge and experience EKU faculty provide could serve the state through a 33synergistic relationship between the two institutions, as well as catalyze programs of distinction at both. Feedback from Other Institutions: No concerns have been raised by other institutions regarding the addition of the MS in Instructional Design and Technology. Cost Projected Revenue over Next Five Years ($) : 3499197 Projected Expenses over Next Five Years ($) : 198550 Will Additional faculty be needed? Yes To establish the EKU IDLT Program and to accommodate future program growth, additional resources are required in terms of faculty positions. Specifically, two full-time faculty positions are necessary to successfully develop the IDLT program, help with the recruitment efforts, identify and maintain connections with external stakeholders and internship providers, and perform other duties that require the dedication of full-time faculty. At the time of this proposal, the IDLT program is conceptualized and proposed by the joint efforts of e-Campus Online Learning and The Department of Art and Design, with the aid of the two potential faculty members. The potential faculty are currently employed as an Instructional Designer and Faculty Development Program Manager at the EKU's Instructional Des Provide a budgetary rationale for creating this new program The program will be funded through revenue generated from new students. Most peripheral needs are already covered through existing services. Two current full-time instructional designers and full-time faculty will be reassigned to the program as well. 34PROPOSED PROGRAM SUMMARY Instituion: University of Kentucky Program Name: Marketing Degree Designation: MASTER OF SCIENCE (MS) Degree Level : Master's Program Description The Master 's in Marketing is a one-year graduate program designed to provide students with in-depth course work in key marketing topics. This program will include core content focused on the areas of: strategic marketing, marketing research, new product development, personal selling and sales management, consumer insights, marketing analytics and digital visualization, corporate social responsibility marketing communications, digital marketing, and branding. Students will take 10 core classes (3 credit hours each). This program will provide specialized knowledge in marketing that is demand by industry. The number of jobs that require graduate level marketing expertise is expected to grow over the next 10 years and include careers such as marketing specialists and sales managers across a variety of manufacturing and sales industries. Will this program replace or enhance any existing programs(s) or tracks, concentrations, or specializations within an existing program? If yes, please specify.

Students that graduate from this MS in Marketing are prepared for jobs such as Marketing Managers/Specialists that require both qualitative and quantitative skills to formulate and execute marketing strategies. The projected growth rate in these types of jobs in the state of Kentucky is expected to be anywhere from 9%-21% for the next 6 years which is much faster than the average growth for both the local area and the United States (www.onetonline.org; 35Marketing Specialists/Marketing Managers). The Department of Marketing & Supply Chain is currently ranked 37th in North America with respect to number of publications in the top 4 marketing journals (Journal of Marketing, Journal of Marketing Research, Journal of Consumer Research, Marketing Science) according to the UT Dallas rankings. The development of a specialized master's program provides one more mechanism for sharing the research that faculty are engaged in. Furthermore, this program fits with the current strategy of the Gatton College of Business & Economics and the University of Kentucky to expand graduate education opportunities.

This program utilizes faculty that are already in place within the Department of Marketing & Supply Chain. This specialized Master 's leverages the resources already in place in the Gatton College of Business & Economics related to marketing, recruiting, and career placement services. 37PROPOSED PROGRAM SUMMARY Instituion: University of Kentucky Program Name: Strategic Human Resource Management and Analytics Degree Designation: MASTER OF SCIENCE (MS) Degree Level : Master's Program Description The Master 's in Strategic Human Resource Management and Analytics (SHRMA) provides the student with the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to contribute to organizational effectiveness. The 30-credit program provides a strong grounding in HR- based analytics, including coursework on data visualization, making evidence-based decisions, research design, and database management. The program also features social network analysis and includes an experiential capstone course giving students the opportunity to apply principles and techniques learned in their coursework to solve real organizational problems.

Students that graduate from the MS in Strategic Human Resource Management and Analytics program are prepared for jobs such as HR Specialists and HR Managers that increasingly require both strategic thinking and strong analytic skills. The projected growth rate in these types of jobs over the next 6-8 years in the state of Kentucky is expected to be 6% for HR Specialists and 8% for HR Managers. Both growth rates exceed national projections (5% for specialists, 7% for managers). Finally, with our dual focus on strategy and analytics, we expect the graduates to be very attractive to consulting firms as HR/management analysts. This job category is projected to see significant growth 38both locally ( 15% ) and nationally ( 14% ) suggesting a need for a well-trained workforce to fill these positions. All statistics are taken from Projections Central and the Bureau of Labor statistics via the Occupational Information Network (www.onetonline.org). The Department of Management is home to the LINKS Center for Social Network Analysis and some of the top researchers in the field (links.uky.edu). The development of a specialized master ' s program (with two courses on networks) provides one more mechanism for sharing the research that faculty are engaged in. Furthermore, this program fits with the current strategy of the Gatton College of Business & Economics and the University of Kentucky to expand graduate education opportunities.

The MAE degree in principal certification will include the same coursework as the Rank I and certification only pathways currently approved under programs 131 and 121 at Western Kentucky University and simply creates a third pathway to the principalship besides Rank I and certification only. This returns the university to the same menu of principal pathways that existed prior to the 2013 statewide revision of principal certification programs. Will this program replace or enhance any existing programs(s) or tracks, concentrations, or specializations within an existing program? If yes, please specify This program enhances the existing certification only and Rank I tracks to the principalship by providing an additional pathway, and will likely increase enrollments in the program overall. CIP Code: 13.0401 Credit Institutional Board Approval Date: 5/1/2020 Implementation Date: 8/3/2020 Student Demand Year 1 - 5 Year 2 - 10 Year 3 - 15 Year 4 - 15 Year 5 - 15 Market Demand Following the decision of the Kentucky Education Professional Standards Board in December 2018 to waive the existing requirement of a Master 's degree prior to admission in a principal preparation program (a move that WKU faculty supported), we are requesting approval to initiate a proposal for a new Master 's of Arts in Education (MAE) pathway to principal certification. This will create three pathways to principal certification at WKU, including the MAE, Rank I, and certification only. The MAE option will be ideal for teachers who are relatively new in the profession and aspire to an 42extended career in school administration. By earning principal certification at the Master's level, these students will be well-position to pursue other advanced credentials in administration, including supervisor of instruction, director of pupil personnel, and superintendent certification at the Rank I level and beyond. The MAE degree in principal certification will include the same coursework as the Rank I and certification only pathways currently approved under programs 131 and 121 at Western Kentucky University. It will include 30 credit hours of coursework in education administration, including 24 credit hours of traditional classes and 6 credit hours of clinical experiences. The curriculum, sequence, and structure of these courses and clinical work all reflect program revisions recently made with the support of a grant from the Wallace Foundation designed to promote model principal training for the 21st century, a grant for which WKU was one of 7 universities across the United States to participate, bringing us into close partnership with districts, the Green River Regional Educational Cooperative, the Kentucky Department of Education, and the Kentucky Education Professionals Standards Board. Regional State National Type Of Job Avg. Wage # Jobs (Postings) Expected GrowthEmployment Demand Indicate source of market demand information Data in the table above come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Handbook. Academic Demand Since 2013 when WKU was no longer allowed to admit students to the principal program without a Master 's degree already earned, we have received numerous inquiries from prospective students seeking to earn principal certification at the Master 's level. While we anticipate WKU 's education administration program will continue to appeal to students at the Rank I and certification only level, this pathway will be attractive to students who are perhaps less seasoned in their teaching careers but eager to enter an administrative role and perhaps earn other advanced certifications at the Rank I level, including supervisor of instruction, director of pupil personnel, director of special education, and superintendent. Again, this program will be identical in terms of coursework and learning objectives from the existing Rank I/certification only principal program. Students will be assessed throughout their program on progress toward mastery of the Professional Standards for Educational Leaders (PSEL). Principal The proposed program is identical to WKU 's existing certification and Rank I pathways for principal certification. Similar programs for certification only and Rank I exist at all of Kentucky's regional universities and two research-focused institutions in order to meet regional needs for highly-trained and certified school principals. To our knowledge, only Murray State University is currently offering a Master 's degree pathway to the principalship, but with the waiver described above, we anticipate many other programs will reinstitute Master 's degree options for principal certification.Unneccessary Duplication Similar Program(s): Program IdInst code Inst Description Title Report year 10604 00196300 Eastern Kentucky UniversityMAED Instructional Leadership 2015 3142 00198900 University of KentuckyMED Educational Leadership 2015 Cost Projected Revenue over Next Five Years ($) : 821700 Projected Expenses over Next Five Years ($) : 0 Will Additional faculty be needed? Yes As this proposal just creates an additional pathway to principal certification using the existing program, no additional faculty are needed. Provide a budgetary rationale for creating this new program No additional funding will be required to offer a Master 's degree pathway to principal certification as the program utilizes the same course work and requirements as the existing Rank I and certification only pathways. Creating an additional pathway to principal certification will likely grow enrollments in WKU 's principal program with no additional costs, and therefore represents a highly efficient and effective use of existing funds and resources. No other programs will be affected. 44THE BELOW AGENDA ITEM WAS PROVIDED AT THE MARCH 23, 2021 ASI COMMITTEE MEETING.

PRESENTERS: Melissa Bell, Vice President of Academic Affairs and Student Success STATUTORY AUTHORITY KRS 164.020 (16) outlines four criteria for statewide academic program review to determine: Consistency with the institution's mission; Alignment with the state's strategic postsecondary agenda and implementation plan. Elimination of unnecessary duplication of programs within and among institutions. Efforts to create cooperative programs with other institutions through traditional means, or by use of distance learning technology and electronic resources, to achieve effec tive and efficient program delivery. KENTUCKY STATEWIDE PROGRAM REVIEW - AY 2017- 2021 The academic program review process is a key responsibility of state coordinating boards like the Council on Postsecondary Education (CPE). The process ensures that academic programs are consistent with state priorities and that public resources are used efficiently for the greater good of the Commonwealth. Purpose of Program Review There are two types of program review - institutional and statewide. The statewide process is designed to complement and enhance, not supplant, institutional -level program reviews. 45THE BELOW AGENDA ITEM WAS PROVIDED AT THE MARCH 23, 2021 ASI COMMITTEE MEETING. Institutional program reviews serve several purposes. They are undertaken to promote continuous improvement. Because there are limited resources, programs must fit with the institution's mission and strategic direction and must be economically viable. Institutional program reviews also focus on academic quality issues, specifically attainment of student learning outcomes as well as distinction of faculty research. And institutional program reviews must meet all the requirements of both institutional and programmatic accreditation. There is some overlap in purpose between institutional and statewide review. Both focus on continuous improvement and alignment with mission and strategic direction. While institutional review focuses on the viability of individual programs, statewide review looks at efficiency from a broader perspective. In Kentucky, statewide review also focuses on the concept of unnecessary d uplication of programs. In short, institutional program review is an intensive, micro- level evaluation of programs while statewide review focuses on the macro view, looking across institutional reviews for data patterns, outliers, and opportunities for efficiencies. The combination of these two levels of evaluation - institutional and statewide - provide a thorough framework for academic program review in Kentucky. Academic Program Review Process AY 2017- 21 While CPE issued a RFP for a firm to assist in statewide program review, institutions continued their institutional program reviews. In 2019, CPE contracted with Gray Associates to work with universities to review all baccalaureate programs. Gray Associat es was selected partly based on their expertise in productivity and efficiency metrics. The firm also has access to multiple data sources, which assists the sophisticated analyses needed to guide the statewide program review. Gray Associates assisted Council staff to create a methodology that provides campuses with consistent, detailed information to help guide decisions about program needs and improvement. In particular, Gray's methodology and data sources provide information about program financial cont ributions and employer needs, information that many institutions have struggled to provide in past program reviews cycles. Data Analysis Through its Program Evaluation System (PES), Gray Associates used multiple data sources to identify student and market demand. Student demand was measured by student inquiries about programs as well as Google search trends. Market demand used job postings from Burning Glass, employment and wage data from the Bureau of 46THE BELOW AGENDA ITEM WAS PROVIDED AT THE MARCH 23, 2021 ASI COMMITTEE MEETING. Labor Statistics and other sources, and placement rat es using Gray's own methodology. Gray also incorporated data on similar programs in the state. Gray Associates tracked more than 50 metrics related to student demand, employment, and competition and then compiled a summary scorecard for each program. This methodology helped institutions identify programs that need further evaluation, but it also he lped them identify programs to start based on lack of market saturation and strong demand. Through its Program Economics Platform (PEP) system, Gray Associates calculated the marginal financial contribution of each program at the comprehensive universit ies. Gray worked with each institution to define and calculate revenue and direct instructional costs for each program. Then the marginal contribution of each program to campus finances was calculated. This analysis did not include overhead costs becaus e those are not changed by program decisions (i.e. the president's salary is not cut when a program is cut). The PEP system identified the revenue (minus institutional grants and scholarships) for each student and assigned that to the courses the student t akes. Gray Associates worked with institutions to assign faculty wages, benefits, and other instructional costs to courses. In the end, the revenue per student credit hour minus the cost per student credit hour was used to calculate the contribution per student credit hour for each program. Because UK and UofL had or was pursuing a contract with EAB, another consulting firm, those two universities requested to use the EAB financial methodology to calculate program -level costs, rather than Gray's contribution analysis. Using data from CPE's comprehensive database and Gray's PEP and PES systems, unnecessary duplication, a criterion for program review, was defined as a program offered at multiple institutions that has low and declining enrollment, low student demand, low market demand, and low or negative contribution margin. More specifically, programs offered at more than one institution with enrollment of 40 or fewer students and has been trending downward for three years, student demand in the 40 th percentile or lower, market demand in the 40th percentile or lower, and low or negative contribution margins were identified for further analysis. Seven programs at five universities met these criteria. They were asked to submit plans to address all of th e following elements - 1) ways to increase student demand and enrollment, 2) ways to better align with market demand, and 3) a process for improving the financial contribution of the program. 47THE BELOW AGENDA ITEM WAS PROVIDED AT THE MARCH 23, 2021 ASI COMMITTEE MEETING. Workshops Using data from PES, Gray Associates facilitated a workshop with each institution. Faculty and staff participants agreed on a scoring rubric, and institutional teams evaluated all undergraduate programs and identified programs to Start, Sunset, Fix/Grow or Sustain. As part of the workshop discussions, faculty and \"Sunset, Fix/Grow or Sustain\" administrators discussed each program's objectives and how they aligned with the institution's mission and strategic plans, another criterion for statewide program review. This discussion was part of the decision -making process as campus representatives made program recommendations. The institutional teams also highlighted possibilities for efficiencies within their program portfolios, which is another criterion for statewide program review. Some workshops were s cheduled in the Spring 2020 semester, but the COVID -19 pandemic forced those to be cancelled. Gray Associates rescheduled those remaining workshops for Fall 2020, which were conducted virtually. Institutions then incorporated these data analyses and pr eliminary recommendations into their institutional review processes. Institutional Reports Each public university was required to submit a program review report with the following information: Institutional program review efforts, including a description of the process and data sources the institution engaged in over the past three years. Analyses and discussions from the campus workshop with a summary of the most important discussion topics and lessons learned from the data analyses. Programs identif ied potential programs to start and categorized existing programs into those to sunset, fix/grow or sustain. Next Steps, including the use of tools provided by Gray Associates, going forward. Each program was required to have an accompanying rationale for the decision. The rationale summarized all data sources and any supplementary information used to arrive at the stated conclusion. CPE staff carefully reviewed the reports. If there were any questions about any rationales, staff followed up with institutions and requested additional information. 48THE BELOW AGENDA ITEM WAS PROVIDED AT THE MARCH 23, 2021 ASI COMMITTEE MEETING. Results CPE has approved 29 baccalaureate programs over the last three years. During the same time frame, 157 baccalaureate programs have been suspended or closed. Following the Gray Associates process, 12 additional programs were identified to sunset, 218 were classified as programs to fix/grow, and 328 were identified as programs to sustain. As expected, most programs fell into the Sustain category, meaning that institutions carefully analyze data before starting programs, evaluate them regularly to ensure viability, and that the metrics are favorable for sustainability. During the campus workshops, institutions also identified possible programs to start. Note that institutions are not requ ired or expected to implement any of these programs. This is simply a list of programs that have favorable student demand and market conditions that institutions can then be evaluated by additional institutional criteria. If institutions determine that t hey have the resources and that these programs should be prioritized, then they may pursue these opportunities. Summary As we move forward with statewide program review, there are several important ideas to keep in mind: Institutional and statewide program reviews are two separate but interrelated processes with some overlapping purposes. Kentucky public institutions have undertaken rigorous institutional program reviews over the past three years in addition to the extens ive statewide process in partnership with Gray Associates. As a result of the statewide process, campuses have access to new analytical tools to help them evaluate both existing and potential new programs. The statewide process was not only about data analysis. The two- day workshops held at each institution involved a wide selection of faculty, staff, and administrators from across the institution. The workshops allowed deep conversation about programs, increased participants' knowledge of the institut ion's program portfolio, and allowed for conversations about collaborative opportunities. 49COUNCIL ON POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION 2Types of Program Review State-level program review complements and enhances institutional program review process.

The statewide process in partnership with Gray Associates, in combination with existing institutional program review processes, has produced a new baseline for statewide program review. CPE should continue to monitor the criteria of alignment with institutional mission, unnecessary duplication, and efficiency but can now focus on the criterion of alignment with the statewide strategic agenda. 53THE BELOW AGENDA ITEM WAS PROVIDED AT THE MARCH 23, 2021 ASI COMMITTEE MEETING.

PRESENTERS: Lee Nimocks, CPE's Chief of Staff and Vice President BACKGROUND INFORMATION During the 2016 legislative session, a bill was passed requiring all new institutional and CPE board members to complete an orientation and education program within their first year of appointment. The measure affected several statutes and those went into effect on July 1, 2016. More specifically, it includes the following provisions: The plan must be developed in coo peration with the public campuses , be comprehensive and contain continuing education elements . New members must receive 6 instructional hours on content that includes their role, the statewide strategic agenda, campus specific information, basic fiduciary responsibilities, and overall ethic and legal considerations for boards. The program must be deliverable both in person and electronic ally. All new members must complete it within one year of appointment and CPE must report those who do not do so to the legislature. Board members from private institutions must be invited to participate, but are not required to do so. Following the pass age of the bill, a work group comprised of CPE staff, Council members, university and KCTCS board liaisons, and the president of AIKCU met to provide input on the development of the implementation plan. The resulting policy was presented to the Council, a nd approved at its November 2016 meeting. PROPOSED REVISIONS Due to a number of additional changes to the statutes and updated procedures among Council staff, the following revisions are proposed to the policy. 61Introduction and Overall Updated policy to reflect that elected board members must also complete the program, to conform to statutory language.

PRESENTERS: Dr. Aaron Thompson, C PE President Shaun McKiernan, Director of Budget and Finance SUPPORTING INFORMATION Each year , the Council review s and approves the agency 's revenue and expenditure budget for the upcoming fiscal year . Below is a description of CPE' s budget as proposed for fiscal 2021 -22. The enacted state budget for 2021 -22 (HB 192), along with CPE's 2020- 22 biennial budget request , submitted to the state budget office and Legislative Research Commission in November 2019 , provide the framework for staff's proposed 2021 -22 agency budget. Budgeted figures for the current year ( i.e., 2020 -21) are included for comparison. CPE General Fund Budget The Commonwealth of Kentucky operates on a biennial budget cycle. Typically, a two - year budget is passed in even- numbered years. During the 2020 regular session of the General Assembly, legislators adopted a one- year state budget (HB 352) due to uncertaint ies in projecting state revenues caused by the COVID -19 pandemic. In the 2021 regular session, lawmakers passed a budget for the 2020-2022 biennium (HB 192) that revised some appropriations for 2020- 21 and included funding for 2021 -22. House Bill 192 is largely a continuation budget for most state agencies , as it is for CPE . Importantly, it restores the levels of General Fund support for CPE operations and technology initiatives to the amounts provided in 2019- 20. In 2020 -21, CPE's General Fund budget was reduced by $3.5 million and expenditure authority for the use of other funds was increased, concomitantly . This action had the same effect as transferring accumulated agency restricted funds to the state General Fund. 74House Bill 192 appropriates $50,000 for the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) Doctoral Scholars program in 2021 -22, maintaining the same level of funding as in the prior year . This program , which was reinstated in 2020- 21, provides scholarships and other programming to help underrepresented minority doctoral candidates at the University of Kentucky and Univ ersity of Louisville succe ed and encourage them to pursue careers in academia after graduation. The 2021- 22 budget also f unds Kentucky's dues to the Southern Regional Education Board ( SREB) , which were traditionally paid from the Contract Spaces program. Contract Spaces provided support for Kentucky residents pursuing degrees in veterinary medicine and optometry , mostly out -of-state . Contract Spaces funding was moved to the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority in 2020- 21, but the funding for SR EB dues remains in CPE's agency budget . The table below shows General Fund appropriations by expenditure category for CPE's agency budget which are included in the 2020 -22 state budget . The expenditure category Technology Trust Fund in the table contains funding for the Kentucky Virtual Library (KYVL) , Technology Support, and the Kentucky Postsecondary Education Network (KPEN). CPE Agency Budget 2020-2022 General Fund Appropriations Expenditure Category FY 2020-21 FY General Fund Operating Funds $5,696,500 $7,205,600a, b$1,509,100 SREB Doctoral Scholars 50,000 50,000 Fund 1,628,300 3,628,300a2,000,000 SREB Dues 211,600 214,800c3,200 Ovarian Cancer Screening 500,000 500,000 0 Total $8,086,400 $11,598,700 $3,512,300 a Restores General Fund to 2019-20 level. b Provides $9,100 for defined calculations (i.e., retirement contributions). c Provides $3,200 to cover an increase in Kentucky's SREB dues. 75As a reminder, s ince 2011, CPE has sustained seven reductions to its agency budget. Cumulatively, the imp act of the cuts since 2010 is - 28.2%. The table below shows the magnitude of General Fund reductions by fiscal year. 2021- 22 Operating Budget The CPE o perating budget includes most of the agency's funding for personnel and operations. Next year, CPE will use state General Fund appropriations , along with $500,000 in Restricted Funds received by the Council for administering federal grants (i.e., primarily the GEAR UP grant) , to fund agency operations. Personnel expenses make up 84 percent of the Agency Operations budget , which is typical for state government agencies . General Fund appropriations in 2021- 22 will support 45 employees, down from 97 staff in 2007 -08. While CPE's 2021 -22 budget is largely a continuation budget, staff has b een able to identify some changes to the budget for 2021 -22 that are needed to maximize the impact of state funds appropriated to CPE. Next year, CPE leaders will continue to focus on the successful transition of students from secondary to postsecondary education and the agency's leadership of the P -20 Education Continuum and related activities . Staff also identified the need for additional collaboration with workforce and ec onomic development leaders in the state and policy /program leadership in this area. In response to these needs, CPE's 2021 -22 operating budget includes funding for additional staff capacity dedicated to the P -20 Education Continuum , college pathway policy /programs , and the development and ongoing support of a new college -going portal . It also includes funds for leadership staff to guide the agency's work in the areas of workforce and economic development , and additional staff capacity in the area of academ ic programs and policies The 2021- 22 operating budget includes funding for additional office, storage, and meeting space, which was not available when CPE moved to the new 100 Airport Road offices. The new space (located above current offices) will reduce costs for off -site 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Change from Prior Year in Agency General Fund Appropriation Fiscal Years 2011-2019 *non-recuring 76storage and rented meeting space, and accommodate additional staffing needs. The 2021- 22 Operating budget reduces grants to campuses funded with state General Fund appropriations. In recent years CPE has provided targeted funds to help support campus -based pilot projects and to sponsor large meetings. This fiscal year and next , CPE will distribut e $17.8 million in federal grants to the campuses through the Governor's Emergency Educ ation and Relief (GEER) funds . These grants are intended to help cover costs related to COVID -19 and support students impacted by the pandemic . Institutions will leverage these and other federal funds, to help improve student succe ss during this difficult time . Finally, it is important to note that for 2020- 21, CPE did not plan on using all of its Restricted Fund expenditure authority in Agency Operations , given the very real possibility of a mid -year General Fund budget reduction. For 2021- 22, C PE plans to leverage all of the Restricted Fund expenditure authorized in HB 192 and the Budget of the Commonwealth for o perations to advance the Council's strategic agenda. See the table below for a comparison of CPE's 2020- 21 and 2021 -22 operating budgets.

The next table provides a summary of the Council's 2020- 21 authorized expenditure levels for these funds and proposed expenditures for 2021-22. The enacted budget (HB 192) specifies the expenditure limits for each fund type. The state budget specifies that Tobacco Fund appropriations in CPE's budget fund cancer research at UK and UofL (divided equally) . For 2020 -21 and 2021- 22, additional Tobacco Funds were provided for spinal cord research at UK and UofL. In 2020 -21, CPE received federal funding to distribute to the public postsecondary institutions through the Governor's Emergency Education Relief (GEER ) Fund and CPE Tobacco, Federal, and Restricted Funds Fiscal Years 2020-21 and 2021-22 Expenditure Category FY 2020-21 FY 2021-22 Difference Tobacco Fund Spinal Cord and Head Injury Research 650,000 $ 650,000 $ - $ Cancer Research and Screening 6,876,100 7,043,800 167,700 Total Tobacco Fund 7,526,100$ Funds GEAR UP 4,000,000$ 3,997,100$ $ Gov.

CPE will also access federal funds next year as part of the GEAR UP grant. GEAR UP, which stands for Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, is a federally funded program that helps students in underprivileged schools prepare for postsecondary educat ion. The GEER Funds that CPE administers a re federal funds designated by the Governor to assist the postsecondary institutions in responding to the COVID -19 pandemic. The Restricted Funds category support s several areas of CPE's budget , including the Cancer Research Match program, Licensure, and Agency Operations. These funds come to CPE from a variety of sources , such as: Cigarette tax proceeds ( i.e., one cent from each pack of cigarettes sold in Kentucky) fund the Cancer Research Match program, which is allocated to UK and UofL equally, provided the institutions are able to match the dis tributions with institutional funds expended on cancer research. Licensure fees fund the Licensure U nit. Th e Council licenses all Kentucky non- profit and for -profit baccalaureate degree granting and above institutions, and out-of-state public institutions operating or soliciting in the Commonwealth. The Licensure Unit also has duties related to the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA), which allows Kentucky public and licensed institutions to do business in other SARA states. Licensure revenue of about $350,000 per year support s the equivalent of two and a half full-time staff members who ensure the Council's licensure duties are performed. Finally, the Council receives funds related to the administration of federal grants and is authorized to spend those funds to support agency operations . With the recent award of the GEAR UP grant, CPE can expect to receive these funds for the next several biennia. Other Funds The Council manages s everal other state funds, including the Equine University Program Trust Fund, the Revolving Loan Fund, and funds housed in the Technology Trust Fund ( i.e., namely , KYVL receipts and smal ler grants). The Equine Program receives funds collected by the state related to pari -mutuel betting. The funding, which has traditionally been about $600,000 per year, is distributed equally to the five institutions with Equine programs (UK, UofL, MoSU, MuSU, and WKU) to help fund capital investments in their programs. 79 The Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) was created to provide start -up funds for expensive information technology programs at Kentucky public colleges and universities. In 2020 - 21, the Office of State Budget Director allowed CPE to u se $800,000 of the RLF to accommodate the $2,000,000 Technology Trust Fund \"fund swap\" , which was implemented that year . HB 192 transfers the remaining balance of the fund to the state General Fund in 2021 -22. The Technology Trust Fund (TTF) receives sta te General Fund appropriations and Kentucky Virtual Library (KYVL) and KPEN receipts. The fund also receives interest earnings, smaller private grant funds, and funds from state government agencies on occasion. These funds will be spent in 2021 -22 as all owed by terms of the funding. The Office of State Budget Director has authorized use of the TTF to house the $2.1 million, three- year grant from the James Graham Brown Foundation that CPE was recently awarded. This grant will be used to establish a Student Success Center at CPE. TTF resources of about $600,000, largely from Technology Support savings accumulated over several years, will be used to initi ate development of a Student P ortal and to fund research and provide strategic guidance on how CPE and the postsecondary institutions can better address the needs of adult learners and achieve an even more positive impact on economic development in the Commonwealth of Kentucky . 80Council on Postsecondary Education 2021-22 Agency Budget Dr. Aaron Thompson, CPE President Shaun McKiernan, Director of Budget and Finance April 16, 2021 812 Increase focus on transition of students from secondary to postsecondary education Additional collaboration with workforce and economic development Develop a Student Portal to facilitate college-going decisions Additional office, meeting, and storage space (versus off-site space) Limited funds for targeted salary adjustments (54% reduction in staff since 2008, while statutory duties increased) Prioritize administration of GEER fund over grants to institutionsCPE Agency Budget Strategic Investments Needed 823CPE Agency Budget Explanation of 2020-21 General Fund Reduction For the Current Year (2020-21), General Assembly: - Reduced Operations General Fund by $1.5 M - Increased authority to spend Licensure Fees (Restricted Funds)- Reduced Technology Trust Fund General Fund by $2.0 M - Allowed other TTF funds to maintain program support levels The 2021-22 budget restores General Fund support for these programs to the 2019-20 level 834CPE Agency Budget General Fund by Expenditure Category Expenditure Category FY 202021 FY 202122 205,600a, b$1,509,100 SREB Doctoral Scholars 50,000 Fund 1,628,300 3,628,300a2,000,000 SREB Dues 211,600 214,800c3,200 Ovarian Cancer Screening 500,000 500,000 0 Total $8,086,400 $11,598,700 $3,512,300 a Restores General Fund to 201920 level. b Provides $9,100 for defined calculations (i.e., retirement contributions). c Provides $3,200 to cover an increase in Kentucky's SREB dues. 845CPE Agency Budget General Fund by Expenditure Category (Cont'd) 856CPE Agency Budget Operating Funds - FY 2022 Highlights Regular employees +$398,900 (compared to FY 21 budget) New AVP for Workforce Senior Associate in Academic Affairs Technology support position Limited, strategic salary enhancements Contract employees +$333,600 P-20 Education Continuum Leaders & Student Portal project manager Additional space on third floor, other cost increases +$139,800 Program Review recurring costs +$200,000 Reduction in Grants funded with state funds -$598,100 Uses Federal Indirect (Restricted) Funds as authorized in HB 192 867CPE Agency Budget Other Funds Expenditure Category FY 202021 FY 202122 Difference Tobacco Fund Spinal Cord and Head Injury Research 650,000 $ 650,000 $ $ Cancer Research and Screening 6,876,100 7,043,800 167,700 Total Tobacco Fund 7,526,100 $ 7,693,800$ Funds GEAR GEER (10,299,100)$ Funds Operations (Federal Indirect1) 2,000,000 $ 500,000 $ (1,500,000)$ Cancer Research Match 4,110,000 4,107,700 (2,300) Licensure (Licensure Fees) 4,923,900$ (1,511,300)$ 1 In 202021, Licensure Fees were also used to support Operations. 878CPE Agency Budget Technology Trust Fund Technology Trust Fund (KRS 164.7921) receives General Fund to support: Kentucky Postsecondary Education Network (KPEN) = $1,724,000 Kentucky Virtual Library (KYVL) = $1,522,600 Technology Support = $381,700 TTF also receives funds from institutions and libraries to support KPEN and KYVL and is used as a repository for administration of private grants CPE plans to use $600,000 in multi-year savings from Technology Support to: Initiate the Student Portal oRequested for the past several biennia oOne-stop shop for prospective students, counselors, and admissions officers oSupport college search, admission, and transfer processes oProvide information on costs, career pathways, etc. Provide consulting services (adul t learners and economic development)shau 889CPE Agency Budget Staff Recommendation The enacted 2020-2022 state budget (HB 192) determines the appropriation levels by spending component for the Council on Postsecondary Education's agency budget The budget presented fits within the framework of funding levels established in HB 192 and identifies several strategic funding components that will facilitate continued progress toward the attainment of state goals Staff recommends that the Council approve the 2021-22 agency budget as on Facebook Follow us @EKU APRIL 2021 CPE REPORT Eastern Kentucky University News for the Council on Postsecondary Education Eastern Kentucky University's seventh-semester senior School of Nursing students are getting hands-on experience like no other students in the history of EKU's nursing program have gotten before. \"This is an unprecedented time in the history of public health and the nursing profession. Not since the 1918 influenza pandemic have we experienced a global pandemic on such a scale,\" said Dr. Melanie Adams-Johnson, associate professor and clinical coordinator in the School of Nursing. Forty-six senior bachelor of science nursing (BSN) students are administering COVID-19 vaccines across EKU's service region this semester. In addition to serving in Baptist Health's vaccination clinic inside EKU's Perkins Building, students are also working in mass vaccination clinics across Fayette and Powell counties. These experiences are all provided as part of their clinical rotations. These service-learning experiences include onsite support and collabo-ration among EKU faculty, public health departments and hospital partners. EKU students have been part of the national COVID-19 response since July 2020, but specifically began giving vaccinations \"at the regional clinics shortly after the vaccines were made available to our communities in January,\" Adams-Johnson said. The student experience is about more than just \"giving a shot,\" though that is an important, impactful part of fighting COVID-19. \"Nurses (current and future) have a unique role. Nurses comprise the largest component of the healthcare workforce in the United States and across the world. The healthcare system cannot operate without competent, professional, healthy nurses who are ready and willing to deploy to care for populations\u2014both inside and outside the walls of the hospital,\" Adams-Johnson said. \"Nurses have always been on the front lines of developing, managing and delivering care to populations in often unconventional practice settings (such as community settings, churches, parking lots and sports arenas). During this past year, our students have had an opportunity to experience and observe the diversity of nursing roles in very tangible ways.\" Adams-Johnson said students are studying the \"determinants of health\" in real time, and with recognizable outcomes. \"They can see and experience social, political and environmental factors that influence why more cases of disease but fewer deaths occur in one area versus another.

Community colleges, including the 16 colleges of the Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS), provide education to students with the fewest resources and most barriers. Yet, these students go on to great careers or achieve success at a university. The 16 colleges of KCTCS: are Kentucky's largest providers of higher education, workforce training, online learning and dual credit classes. are the most affordable path to work or to a bachelor's degree. offer short-term programs that help people get to work quickly. are Kentucky's primary educators of life-saving nurses and other health care professionals. train the most skilled trades workers in Kentucky. are number two in the nation in the number of credentials awarded by public, two-year colleges. had a record number of graduates last academic year in the middle of a pandemic. 93KE KCTCS GOOD NEWS REPORT April is Community College Month, which brings the good works of KCTCS colleges to the forefront. The primary goals of Community College Month, established by the American Association of Community College Trustees, are to improve awareness of the economic, academic and equity advantages of attending community colleges. Dedicating a month to community colleges and their students' successes also helps shatter longtime stigmas wrongly associated with public two-year colleges. During the last year as COVID changed the world, KCTCS students, faculty and staff had stellar results even though they had to adapt to remote learning and working. This was a challenge for some who had no broadband access, no computer or both. Some students completed coursework on their phones. Several colleges received grants to purchase computers for their students and others loaned them used ones. The colleges also set up Wi-Fi hotspots in their parking lots and other areas. Because so many students and their families were unemployed and suffered from food insecurity, each college also provided food pantries. Despite all of this, KCTCS had a record number of graduates receiving a record number of credentials. KCTCS colleges played an integral role in their communities as well. As hospitals and other medical providers needed equipment for current or future patients, all 16 colleges stepped up to donate personal protective equipment along with beds and ventilators. Colleges use these items in nursing, respiratory therapy and other health care programs. Additionally, colleges that offer 3D printing programs created faced shields for local hospitals staff. \"Community College Month is the one time each year that America focuses on the student success and good works of colleges in their communities,\" KCTCS Interim President Paul Czarapata said. \"Our mission is to improve the lives and employability of Kentuckians. It's something we take very seriously and live every day. Our colleges' response to the pandemic clearly shows this.\" 94GOOD NEWSGOOD NEWS APRIL 2021 After navigating the effects of a global pandemic for the last year to deliver access to education, Kentucky State University has more reasons than ever to celebrate its 135th anniversary as an institution of higher education.

The new plan, entitled \"Vision 2025: Racing Toward Our Highest Potential, \" focuses on the strategic goals of prioritizing student success outcomes, fostering a culture of campus engagement, and ensuring sustainable institutional viability. Within each of those goals are concrete strategic objectives outlining metrics and accountability. In alignment with the strategic plan and moving the institution forward through 2025, Kentucky State is filling key positions to implement \"Vision 2025. \" In order to better prioritize student success outcomes, a search is currently underway for a permanent provost and vice president of academic affairs. Responsible for the academic mission of Kentucky State, the next provost and vice president of academic affairs will have a significant impact on the campus, in the community, and in the region. The role provides on-going supervision of deans and directors and is responsible for the administration of academic-related functions of the University. Over the last few years, the University completed the Presidential Green Ribbon Commission on Academic Prioritization and Budget Alignment for a more streamlined and focused delivery of the academic mission. The University also recently consolidated the academic organizational structure, resulting in a reduction of the number of academic colleges within the University. Another effort to better prioritize student success outcomes is the search for a permanent vice president for student engagement and campus life. The vice president for student engagement and campus life will, in the midst of a global pandemic, play a major role in coordinating, implementing, and evaluating the University's student engagement and retention initiatives. Finally, also aligning with student success outcomes, is the search for a permanent athletics director who will plan, administer, and direct intercollegiate athletic programs for men and women. University officials hope to fill all positions by July 1. As many institutions experienced declines over the course of the last year, University officials believe filling these key positions will further stabilize the University and expedite the fulfillment of the new strategic plan.

Harlow and Quavo defeated 2Chainz and Lil Baby 21-7 in the matchup. Harlow tweeted after the game that he would donate the proceeds to Kentucky State and Simmons. Kentucky State University President M. Christopher Brown II responded to the tweet with a tweet of his own, thanking Harlow and informing him that his song, \"What's Poppin, '\" is on repeat in his car. \"I believe Jack Harlow's gift was very impactful to Kentucky State University because it gives us an opportunity to be and feel seen, not only by our surrounding cities and local community but by the nation, \" Kentucky State University Student Government Association President Kirk Miller said. \"When hearing about it, I know Thorobreds felt a sense of pride, as I did that my HBCU was being supported by such a generous donation from our star rapper. \" Savion Briggs, a student at Kentucky State, said being a Louisville native makes this gift special. \" As a Louisville native, seeing an artist from my city giving back to HBCUs means a lot to me, \" Briggs said. \"I hope that other Louisville native artists like Jack join in to become more active and supportive of Kentucky State University. \" Kentucky State University student Micayla Garcia said hopefully others will follow in Harlow's footsteps. \"Hopefully other celebs follow suit and make donations to HBCUs with smaller names, \" Garcia said. \"That being said, we must also encourage our alumni to make donations, as well. We need to remember to support ourselves because others aren't required to do so. \" Miller said he was proud to see the focus on HBCUs during the NBA All-Star weekend. \"NBA All-Star weekend bringing awareness to HBCUs was very much appreciated, because HBCUs have been slowly but surely gaining more and more popularity, especially with VP (Kamala) Harris in the national office, \" Miller said. \"But this brings it to a whole new level, a global level. \" Briggs was happy to see the NBA 's involvement with HBCUs. \"There are so many Black youths that pay attention to these kinds of events that may have never heard of HBCUs before now, \" Briggs said. \"This is a step in the right direction toward educational equity at the university level. HBCUs are a huge part of Black culture. The NBA has made an enormous impact on our culture than they may realize. \" Mahogany Shelton, a senior at Kentucky State, said the awareness of HBCUs brought on by the NBA All-Star weekend was well needed. \"It helped to show the young people who idolize (NBA players and the celebrities who participated) that an education at an HBCU is the best you can possibly get, \" Shelton said. \"In other words, it takes something big to create something bigger and the NBA All-Star weekend has created the momentum needed for Kentucky State University and HBCUs all around. \" Kentucky State University is one of 25 HBCUs included in an innovative program by Diageo North America to develop future leaders and help shape a more equitable society.

It's a reflective time for me and the Cardinal Family, punctuated by an array of emotions. The pandemic has had dramatic consequences for people, families and institutions everywhere, and still, despite the odds, the University of Louisville has overcome and emerged stronger than ever. In this report, you'll see how we've experienced our highest enrollment in 20 years, we've continued delivering a rst-class education and our online programs have been recognized as some of the best in the nation. Thanks to the astounding dedication and hard work of our staff, faculty and students, we've been able to keep campus traditions alive - although they looked different - and we've remained a leader in our city, state and among institutions across the country. The formation of UofL Health allowed us to ensure our community and commonwealth maintained widespread access to health care, which was particularly timely in addressing the pandemic. UofL Health allowed us to be among the rst in the state and country to acquire the vaccine and keep Jewish Hospital open during the biggest health crisis our world has seen in more than a hundred years. Many people don't know that Breonna Taylor was an employee of UofL Health. She was an emergency room technician at UofL Health- Medical Center East. We reflect mournfully on the loss of Breonna's life one year ago. Her loss has had a lasting impact on our university community and has reverberated strongly throughout our campuses. As many of our students, faculty and staff boldly call for anti- racist action at UofL and within the community at large, my team stays unwaveringly committed to our Cardinal Principle of Diversity and Inclusion in all of our decisions.. I am deeply humbled by the level of commitment our university community, alumni and supporters have shown this past year to ensure that the University of Louisville remains a great place to learn, work and invest. Despite the challenges and difculties, I am condent that UofL will emerge stronger than before and will be poised to deliver even more fully on our mission. Go Cards! Neeli Bendapudi President, University of LouisvilleISSUE 111 | FEBRUARY/MARCH 2021 THE PRESIDENT'S REPORT COVID-19 shows value of UofL Health in its rst year In November 2019, UofL Health acquired the former KentuckyOne Health assets, taking on a struggling system on the brink of closing that, in turn, threatened the community's access to health care. After one year, UofL Health supports more than 700 providers and 12,000 team members, has added several new facilities including one in Louisville's medically underserved West End and posts revenues of more than $1.8 billion. Drawing patients from each of Kentucky's 120 counties plus neighboring states, UofL Health is the state's largest academic health system. UofL Health created almost 300 new positions and recruited 500 nurses and 40 new physicians in its rst year to meet the needs of an increasing number of patients. The formation of UofL Health also preserved more than 5,800 jobs and 60 residency positions with UofL's School of Medicine. We formed UofL Health to address the signicant needs of our community and our commonwealth, but its impact has been even more substantial than we could have predicted, particularly in helping address the COVID-19 pandemic. The rst vaccines shipped to Kentucky were administered at UofL Hospital, which received 975 doses of the Pzer vaccine. Our entire team - from support staff, to nurses, to providers and physicians - deserves credit for this success in building an organization of which Kentucky can be proud. UofL is once again a top producer of Fulbright Scholars University of Louisville students continue to contribute to international understanding through successful participation in the Fulbright U.S. Student Program. The Fulbright Program is the U.S. government's flagship international educational exchange program. Started in 1946, the Fulbright Program marks its 75th anniversary this year. For the 2020-2021 academic year, UofL was once again named a Fulbright U.S. Student Program Top Producing Institution. It marks UofL's seventh year on the list. UofL has a total of 13 Fulbright scholars for the 2020-2021 academic year. Since 2003, UofL has produced 148 Fulbrights, more than all other Kentucky public institutions combined. The distinction from the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs was published in the Feb. 15 online edition of The Chronicle of Higher Education. A list of institutions can be found here . Our students have a global world view that benets all humankind, I commend our students, faculty and staff who work so hard every year to secure these opportunities. 103THE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE IS AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY INSTITUTION. THE DELIVERY OF THIS PUBLICATION IS CARBON NEUTRAL. IT IS PRINTED ON 100% POST-CONSUMER WASTE RECYCLED PAPER. IT WAS PRODUCED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE AND PRINTED USING NONSTATE FUNDS. THE CARDINAL FAMILY GROWS IN SIZE AND DIVERSITY, DESPITE NATIONAL TRENDS The National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) reported postsecondary enrollments in the United States declined 2.5% in the fall, and public college enrollments went down by 4%. Freshman enrollment also dropped 13% nationwide, according to the NSC. Despite these alarming national trends, the University of Louisville is posting strong enrollment gures for the 2020-2021 academic year with undergraduate increases in underrepresented minorities. UofL has held steady, even increasing our enrollment while other public universities nationwide are seeing declines during this challenging year. We are especially pleased that underrepresented minorities are nding a college home with us. In fall 2020, total enrollment was up by 2.4%. Preliminary enrollment gures for the spring 2021 semester show an increase of 0.98% from the previous year. From fall 2019 to fall 2020, undergraduate enrollment of Black students rose 8%, while enrollment of Hispanic and Asian students increased 13% and 11%, respectively. These strong enrollment numbers are a direct reflection of the hard work and innovative efforts made by our staff and faculty. We plan to maintain this momentum as we gear up to resume in-person courses this fall. NEW AND REVAMPED POSITIONS BOOST U ofL'S ANTI-RACIST AGENDA Jobs focused on diversity and equity: this is the latest validation for UofL's intention to become a premier anti-racist university . The influx of new and renewed diversity-focused positions, funded by deans and other leaders throughout the organization, support this commitment. The dedicated personnel are working to create an inclusive culture among students, faculty and staff, while assisting in efforts to increase retention and graduation rates of underrepresented minority students. They're aimed at recruiting minority faculty through incentive programs. They're supporting and recognizing staff for contributions in advancing diversity. They're auditing curricula to determine the need for revisions, along with new content and training. They're creating better opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses to collaborate with the university. These are some of the newly created job duties that will help move the needle for UofL's anti-racism agenda. Other areas, like the Graduate School, hired personnel prior to the launch of UofL's Cardinals Against Racism Agenda (CARA). A number of new committees have also been formed with a focus on the anti-racism agenda. Staff Senate chartered an anti-racism committee with a seat on the executive committee. The Student Government Association has also created a diversity and inclusion committee. In the past year, the following individuals in our university have lled new or revamped positions in support of expanded diversity and inclusion initiatives at UofL: Brigitte Burpo, assistant dean for diversity, equity and inclusion, College of Education and Human Development Valerie Clay, coordinator for diversity, equity and inclusion, J.B. Speed School of Engineering Crystal Rae Coel, assistant dean for student affairs and diversity, Brandeis School of Law Cherie Dawson-Edwards, associate dean for diversity, engagement, culture and climate, College of Arts & Sciences Marc D. Ellis, assistant director of procurement diversity and inclusion, Ofce of Procurement Services Audra French, assistant director of student affairs and diversity, equity and inclusion, School of Dentistry Amalia Gamez, Latinx admissions counselor, Ofce of Admissions Leondra Gully, director of Black and multicultural initiatives, Cultural Center Anna Hinton, assistant dean for administration and diversity, equity and inclusion, School of Dentistry Trinidad Jackson, assistant dean for culture and liberation, School of Public Health & Information Sciences Emma Sterrett-Hong, associate dean of equity and inclusion, Kent School of Social Work Nakia Strickland, associate director for diversity engagement, UofL Alumni Association Morgan West, new student nancial aid advisor, Ofce of Financial Affairs 104PRESIDENT'S REPORT APRIL 2021ONE YEAR LATER: UK'S COVID RESPONSE BY THE NUMBERSPRESIDENT'S REPORT APRIL 2021 UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY The COVID-19 pandemic is the challenge of a century. It underscores how special those things we often take for granted \u2014 like gathering with friends and family for a meal or other moment where we come together \u2014 really can be for all of us. We need connections. It's why a community like the one at the University of Kentucky is so important. It is inherent to who we are. That's also why, at the University of Kentucky, we are determined to meet this moment. Our people\u2014from across our campus\u2014have joined in common cause with uncommon resolve to keep our community, and those we serve, safe. On March 6, Kentucky and UK HealthCare marked one year since the first patient tested positive for COVID-19. In the time since that day, a series of unprecedented transitions have taken place at the University of Kentucky. UK HealthCare treated this first patient. Faculty and staff quickly moved every class to a remote learning format. Athletic events came to a grinding halt as teams discussed whether to cancel or postpone entire seasons. And that was just the beginning. For many, this time one year ago marked the anniversary of the realization that life as they knew it was being fundamentally altered. Reimagining a \"new normal\" for an entire campus community and beyond was a daunting task. But together, the UK family has risen to the challenge \u2014 exemplifying what's truly possible in the face of adversity. But how do we measure the breadth and depth of these efforts? One way is through numbers. At the same time, we recognize that the people behind those numbers are allowing us to meet this moment. Eli Capilouto President 105VACCINES: UK ADMINISTERS SHOTS OF HOPE The UK vaccination clinic recently marked a monumental milestone in the fight against the virus \u2014 administering 200,000+ COVID-19 vaccines to citizens across the Commonwealth, including front-line health care workers, first responders, teachers, school personnel, essential workers, those with health conditions and, recently, our community more broadly. In January, the university pledged to do more and be more for the people of the state when it opened the Kroger Field location. Now, it's currently the largest clinic in the region \u2014 serving 20,000+ Kentuckians per week. In March, the clinic underwent yet another expansion, allowing UK to often vaccinate more than 4,000 people each day. Before there was a vaccine clinic to manage, there was continuous COVID-19 testing. Tucked away on the sixth floor of the University of Kentucky Albert B. Chandler Hospital, UK HealthCare's clinical microbiology lab is home to one of the most important factors in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 patient testing. Since last spring, the lab has been administering COVID-19 tests to UK HealthCare patients thanks to multiple collaborations across the hospital system. By March, they had conducted nearly 115,000 COVID-19 tests.Additionally, UK has strived to protect the campus community through ongoing student testing, which remains available at no cost through a third-party expert \u2014 Lexington-based testing and genomics company, Wild Health. Utilizing a third party for testing has allowed UK HealthCare to maintain its capacity for testing health workers, first responders and the community. Between University Health Services and Wild Health, the university by March had conducted nearly 70,000 COVID-19 tests for students.On any given day, UK Health Corps is made up of approximately 60 dedicated staff members working to keep the UK campus healthy and safe, managing everything from contact tracing and academic coordination to transportation and communications. Since July 2020, Health Corps has replied to more than 5,000 emails and managed 25,000+ phone calls. To date, the Wellness Support Connectors have completed more than 17,000 resource tasks for students, faculty and staff affected by COVID-19. These tasks range from a simple check-in calls to a prescription delivery. \"The work the entire Health Corps team is doing is nothing short of remarkable,\" said Hannah Simms, associate project manager with Health Corps. \"It's amazing to think that in one year this team has built a modern public health infrastructure that has allowed our campus community to find a path forward in a challenging time.\"VOLUNTEERS: THE IMPERATIVE WORK THEY DO Vaccination clinics are massive public health undertakings, which require many helping hands. On any given day, approximately 120 staff members and volunteers work at Kroger Field \u2014 serving in roles from immunizers to way-finders. In addition to groups from the College of Medicine, volunteers from the College of Pharmacy, College of Dentistry, College of Health Sciences and College of Nursing have volunteered as immunizers at the clinic. In addition to running the clinic, employees with UK HealthCare Pharmacy Services are also volunteering their time.

WKU names Robert 'Bud' Fischer Jr. Provost and VP for Academic Affairs WKU has named Robert \"Bud\" Fischer Jr. Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs beginning July 5 . Dr. Fischer is the dean of the College of Basic and Applied Sciences at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro. \"Dr. Fischer has a record of success in elevating the universities where he has held leadership positions,\" WKU President Timothy C. Caboni said. \"His experience with applied learning, improvements in retention and graduation rates and familiarity with growing sponsored research all are relevant to continuing WKU's climb to greater h eights as we implement our strategic plan.\" Dr. Fischer said he is honored and excited to join WKU. \"This is a special place that provides tremendous opportunities to change the lives of students and entire communities through education, research, innovation and service,\" he said. \"During my interviews and visit, I learned about WKU's strong commitment to its students and to student success. These are the same values th at I have focused on throughout my career and I look forward to working with my new colleagues to build on that foundation and engage in the innovative thinking and strategic development that will help define the future of this amazing institution.\" Dr. Fischer said the role WKU plays in serving first -generation students has special significance for him. \"My career speaks volumes about the transformational impact of higher education,\" he said. \"I've been privileged to mature from a first -generation college student to a professor of Biology and a university administrator, and I look forward to working with the WKU community to continue providing similar, life -transforming opportunities to WKU students.\" Prior to joining MTSU in 2012, Dr. Fischer was chair of the Department of Biology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham; associate chair of the Department of Biological Sciences at Eastern Illinois University and a tenured professor. Dr. Fischer has a Ph.D. in evolutionary biology from the University of So uth Carolina, a master's degree in environmental biology from State University College at Buffalo and a bachelor's degree in ecology from State University College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse, New York. See https://www.wku.edu/news/articles/index.php?v iew=article&articleid=9523 WKU offering public health degree at regional campuses Adult learners in the Elizabethtown, Glasgow and Owensboro regions will have a new degree option throug h WKU Public Health beginning this fall.

See https://www.wku.edu/news/articles/index.php?view=article&articleid=9522 Robert 'Bud' Fischer Jr. 107Biology professor receives $429,768 grant to study stress and sleep loss WKU biology professor Noah Ashley has been awarded a three -year, $429,768 R15 grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences , one of the 27 institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health, to i nvestigate how stress is involved in regulating the inflammatory response to sleep loss. \"This research evaluates the mechanisms that lead to inflammation from sleep loss. One of those mechanisms involves stress,\" Dr. Ashley said. \"In the past year, the pandemic has caused stress in all of our lives. It's also affected our quantity and quality of sleep. So this research is incredibly relevant t oday.\" The project's premise relates to the worldwide increases in obesity that have led to a higher incidence of obstructive sleep apnea, which is characterized by recurring events of airway collapse during sleep, intermittent low o xygen levels and fragmented sleep. Previous research has linked sleep fragmentation with increased inflammatory responses that could provide a link between disturbed sleep and adverse health outcomes, Dr. Ashley said. \"Chronic inflammation can have a huge impact on someone's life by increasing the risk for development of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer,\" he said. \"If we can understand how inflammation arises from sleep loss, then potential therapeutics could be developed to mitigate inflammation in patients who experience dysregulated sleep, like obstructive sleep apnea.\" WKU undergraduate students will be highly involved in the project. In the previous grant, 15 WKU students were trained to conduct biomedical research.
