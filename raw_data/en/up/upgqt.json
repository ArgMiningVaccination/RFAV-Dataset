Whether you're looking to explore the bustling heart of Kathmandu or retreat into the embracing arms of nature amidst the mind-blowing beauty of the Himalayas, we've got your ultimate holiday abode sorted out - say Namaste to the [Dwarika's Kathmandu](http://www.dwarikas.com/index.php) and the [Dwarika's Resort Dhulikhel](http://www.dwarikas-dhulikhel.com/index.php). If you must thank us with a pot of chhaang later, we won't complain. The Dwarika's Kathmandu Located just minutes away from Tribhuvan International Airport, our induction to Nepali culture and history began the moment we set foot into the [Dwarika's Kathmandu](http://www.dwarikas.com/index.php). Built with handmade bricks and surrounded by an extensive collection of historical artifacts (think intricate wood carvings, bronze crafts, and terracotta tiles of centuries past), the hotel was designed in the likeness of Newari palaces, and yes - they make you feel just like royalty too. If you're looking for an exceptional culinary experience (or two), book yourself in for a 22-course meal at Dwarika's signature restaurant, Krishnarpan - we dare you! Honestly, we had the 6-course set and slipped into food coma. For the finest Japanese food in Nepal, don't miss out on Mako's - both restaurants warrant a visit to Dwarika's even if you're not staying there. The Dwarika's Resort Dhulikhel But if you're just looking for a quiet sanctuary away from the madness of Kathmandu that offers an authentic Himalayan experience and allows you to surrender completely to the relaxation and rejuvenation of mind, body, and spirit, (um, who isn't?) we hear you. Set over 20 acres with breathtaking views of the Himalayas and surrounding valleys, the [Dwarika's Resort Dhulikhel](http://www.dwarikas-dhulikhel.com/index.php) is a veritable slice of heaven-on-earth. Check out the Pancha Kosha Himalayan Spa for a host of unique spa treatments based on Buddhist medicine, Ayurveda, and traditional folkloric knowledge from the Himalayan region. Not into massages? Other activities you can sign up for run the gamut from pottery, traditional block printing, farming, cookery, hiking, yoga, and meditation. Sleek city dwellers - take a five-kilometre hike from the resort to Dwarika's eco-organic farms to rightly acquaint yourselves with where your food actually comes from. This is locavorism and organic farming at its best, and we guarantee you'll work up a fine appetite for a feast of the freshest produce (hand-picked by you) at Nature's Flavours Restaurant, or visit Mako's Zen for a delectable spread of vegetarian Japanese food that'll fill you up without weighing you down. They say book in for a minimum of 2 nights to fully experience the property; we say check in at your own risk - you won't want to leave. "}
