Intervention Standing orders can be established for the administration of one or more specific vaccines to clients in healthcare settings such as clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, and long-term care facilities. In settings that require attending provider signatures for all orders, standing order protocols allow assessment and vaccination in advance of the provider signature. CPSTF Finding and Rationale Statement [CPSTF Finding and Rationale Statement](/media/pdf/Vaccination-Standing-Orders.pdf)for details including implementation issues, possible added benefits, potential harms, and evidence gaps. Promotional Materials About The Systematic Review [Community Guide systematic review completed in 2009](/media/pdf/Vaccination-Standing-Orders-Archive.pdf)(29 studies, search period 1997-2009) combined with more recent evidence (6 studies, search period 2009-February 2012). This review was conducted on behalf of the CPSTF by a team of specialists in systematic review methods, and in research, practice and policy related to increasing appropriate vaccination. Summary of Results [CPSTF Finding and Rationale Statement](/media/pdf/Vaccination-Standing-Orders.pdf). The systematic review included 35 studies. - Overall, vaccination rates increased by a median of 24 [percentage points](/pages/glossary.html#pointchange)(27 studies). - Standing orders used alone increased vaccination rates by a median of 16 percentage points (9 studies). - Standing orders used in combination with additional interventions increased vaccination rates by a median of 27 percentage points (19 studies). - Standing orders increased vaccination rates among children by a median of 28 percentage points (4 studies). - All of the studies that did not provide a common measure of change for vaccination rates reported favorable results (7 studies). Summary of Economic Evidence [CPSTF Finding and Rationale Statement](/media/pdf/Vaccination-Standing-Orders.pdf). Three U.S. studies that evaluated the economics of standing orders for pneumococcal, influenza, and Tdap vaccines were included in the economic review (search period 1980 2012). All monetary values are reported in 2013 U.S. dollars. - The median intervention cost was $5.55 per person per year (3 studies). - The median cost was $29 per additional vaccinated person (3 studies). - Intervention groups had a median size of 11,813 clients (3 studies). Applicability - Various clinical settings (e.g., clinics, hospitals, long-term care facilities) - Different vaccination providers (e.g., nurses, pharmacists) - Children, adolescents, and adults - Inpatient and outpatient settings Evidence Gaps [What are evidence gaps?](/pages/evidence-gaps.html)) - How effective are these interventions for adolescent populations? - How effective are these policies in communities with disparities in vaccination rates? - What are strategies to address implementation barriers for standing orders in systems of care? Study Characteristics - Included studies were conducted in a wide range of clinical settings, including healthcare clinics, hospitals, and long-term care facilities. - Evaluated interventions were used with different vaccination providers including nurses and pharmacists.

American Journal of Preventive Medicine 2016;50(6):797-808. Analytic Framework Effectiveness Review When starting an effectiveness review, the systematic review team develops an analytic framework. The analytic framework illustrates how the intervention approach is thought to affect public health. It guides the search for evidence and may be used to summarize the evidence collected. The analytic framework often includes intermediate outcomes, potential effect modifiers, potential harms, and potential additional benefits. Economic Review No content is available for this section.

Search Strategies Effectiveness Review The CPSTF findings are based on studies included in the original review (search period 1980-1997) combined with studies identified in the updated search (search period 1997- February 2012). Reference lists of articles reviewed as well as lists in review articles were also searched, and members of our coordination team were consulted for additional references. Details of the original search (1980-1997) The following five electronic databases were searched during the original review period of 1980 up to 1997: MEDLINE, Embase, Psychlit, CAB Health, and Sociological Abstracts. The team also reviewed reference lists in articles and consulted with immunization experts. To be included in the review, a study had to: - have a publication date of 1980 1997; - address universally recommended adult, adolescent, or childhood vaccinations; - be a primary study rather than, for example, a guideline or review; - take place in an industrialized country or countries; - be written in English; - meet the evidence review and Guide chapter development team's definition of the interventions; provide information on one or more outcomes related to the analytic frameworks; and - compare a group of persons who had been exposed to the intervention with a group who had not been exposed or who had been less exposed. In addition, we excluded studies with least suitable designs for two interventions (provider reminder/recall and client reminder/recall) where the literature was most extensive. Details of the update search (1997- February 2012) The team conducted a broad literature search to identify studies assessing the effectiveness of Vaccine Preventable Disease interventions in improving vaccination rates. The following nine databases were searched during the period of 1997 up to February 2012: CABI, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, ERIC, MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, Soci Abs and WOS. Reference lists of articles reviewed as well as lists in review articles were also searched, and subject matter experts consulted for additional references. To be included in the updated review, a study had to: - have a publication date of 1997- February 2012; - evaluate vaccinations with universal recommendations; - meet the evidence review and Guide chapter development team's definition of the interventions; - be a primary research study with one or more outcomes related to the analytic frameworks; - take place in an high income country or countries; - be written in English - compare a group of persons who had been exposed to the intervention with a group who had not been exposed or who had been less exposed. In addition, we excluded studies with least suitable designs for two interventions (provider reminder/recall and client reminder/recall) where the literature was most extensive Search Terms - Immunization - Vaccination - Immunization Programs Economic Review The present review included studies that reported economic outcomes from the 2000 review (search period 1980-1997) combined with studies identified from updated searches (search period 1997- February 2012) within the standard medical and health-related research databases, Google Scholar, and databases specialized to economics and social sciences. The details of the two sets of searches are provided below. Details of the Updated Search (1997- February 2012) The team conducted a broad literature search to identify studies assessing interventions to improve vaccination rates. The following nine databases were searched during the period of 1997 up to February 2012: CABI, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, ERIC, MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, Soci Abs and WOS. In addition, Google Scholar and specialized databases (CRD-University of York: NHS EED, EconLit, and JSTOR), were also searched. Reference lists of articles reviewed as well as lists in review articles were also considered, and subject matter experts consulted for additional references. Search Terms - Immunization - Vaccination - Immunization Programs To be included in the updated review, a study had to do the following: - Have a publication date of 1997- February 2012 - Evaluate vaccinations with universal recommendations - Meet the evidence review and Community Guide review team's definition of the interventions - Be a primary research study with one or more outcomes related to the analytic framework(s) - Take place in a high income country or countries - Be written in English; and - Compare a group of persons who had been exposed to the intervention with a group who had not been exposed or who had been less exposed.

In addition, we excluded studies with least suitable designs for two interventions (provider reminder/recall and client reminder/recall) where the literature was most extensive. Considerations for Implementation - Standing order interventions may improve the efficiency and flow of patient care in busy inpatient and outpatient care settings. - Included studies reported the following barriers to implementation: - Gaps in staff education, training, and perceived benefit - Personnel concerns about additional workload - Staff reluctance to administer vaccines without a physician's order - Attending physicians' resistance to having hospitalized patients vaccinated - Logistical difficulties - Concern that vaccination would interfere with scheduled treatments or procedures Crosswalks Healthy People 2030 Healthy People 2030 includes the following objectives related to this CPSTF recommendation.
