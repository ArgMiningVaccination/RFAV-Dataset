Because we humans internalize life's stressors, big emotions, and adverse experiences, our therapists facilitate healing on both a mind and body level. Our team of well trained, neuro-affirming, highly experienced therapists provide a wide range of culturally competent therapeutic approaches aimed at treating core issues, not just surface symptoms. Working from an attachment lens that evaluates relationship successes and injuries, we develop a better understanding of how to tailor our care to meet the needs of our individual clients. From there, we use a combination of evidenced based practices, including mindfulness, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), behavioral techniques, and body-based (somatic) approaches to ensure our clients cultivate essential skills for thriving, not just surviving. Each of us has worked with a diverse array of clients, including children, families, and individuals. We've helped our clients awaken their inner healer and access their reservoirs of wisdom, strength, and resilience. We've been humbled by accompanying our clients on their healing journeys and celebrated with them as they've overcome such difficulties as grief and loss, depression, anxiety, unresolved trauma, and relationship issues. And we've helped them develop a lifelong toolbox that can be used when challenging situations arise in the future. Whether you're struggling with daily worries, heavy emotions, painful memories, or the adjustment to new circumstances, our clinicians are here to help. Take the next step in your healing journey today and call for a free 15-minute consultation.
