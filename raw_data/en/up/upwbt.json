From [stressful situations](https://dralexjimenez.com/stress-management-bodys-health/) to making sure that each [organ system](https://dralexjimenez.com/the-real-reason-behind-pain-how-the-spine-is-connected-to-internal-organs/) is working properly, the body can handle anything that life throws at it. But when there are unwanted pathogens or severe injuries that the body is going through, it can cause damage to the tissues and cells inside the body. The body has the natural ability to heal itself but when the injury is severe, it can take a bit longer on the healing process. That is where regenerative medicine comes in and helps the body recover faster. In this 2 part series, we will be taking a look at the post-procedure protocols that a person should follow after their regenerative treatment. Part 2 will discuss how [inflammation](https://dralexjimenez.com/chiropractic-affects-inflammation/) can affect the body after the procedure and what anti-inflammatory food is perfect for the body. By referring patients to qualified and skilled providers that specialized in regenerative cellular therapy, we work with affiliated clinics and distributor organizations, both internationally and nationally with the services that we offer. We find that education is the key to asking valuable questions to our providers. Dr. Alex Jimenez DC provides this information as an educational service only.

If you have any questions, please call Dr. Jimenez at 915-850-0900. What Is Regenerative Medicine? Since the body has many ways to naturally heal itself from injury, it sometimes needs some help regenerating the damaged cells that have been sustained from severe injuries. This is where regenerative medicine comes in and helps the body out a bit more. There is some misinformation about regenerative medicine since everyone has heard the word \"stem cells.\" However, the proper term for it is human cellular tissue products or HCTP and this plays a huge role in regenerative medicine. [Research shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4664309/) that regenerative medicine is an interdisciplinary field that promotes regeneration and restoration of diseased and injured tissues and whole organs. [Regenerative medicine](https://dralexjimenez.com/guide-regenerative-cellular-treatment-part-1/) can also help regenerate the body's cellular structure back to its original form and help speed up the body's healing process. The Post-Procedure Protocol For Regenerative Medicine Treatment In the [last article](https://dralexjimenez.com/preprocedure-protocols-regenerative-medicine-part-1/), it discussed what to do prior before a regenerative treatment and the steps that should be taken before anyone is going into the procedure. But what should a person do after the procedure is done? Many specialist providers that work with HCTP, want the individual to get the most out of the treatment. Surprisingly the treatment works best when a person is eating [the right foods](https://dralexjimenez.com/nutritional-management-adverse-food-reactions/), engaging in [healthy activities](https://dralexjimenez.com/4-tips-staying-healthy-el-paso-tx/), and following the instructions exactly as indicated by the medical provider. Studies show that the healing can continue to work for up to 8 months. There are 3 rules that everyone should follow to help the human cellular tissue products (HCTP) have an optimal environment for growth. By following these steps, it can help get the results that a person is hoping for. If It Hurts, Stop It is common to feel some pain and discomfort for 24-48 hours after the injection. A person may be numb in the areas that were treated for 4-6 hours after the procedure. But after the first 2-3 days, the soreness will start to subside and it is important to listen to the body. Since the areas are numb, many healthcare providers ask their patients to refrain from any strenuous activities like a hard workout, however, to stay as mobile as possible with [light exercises](https://dralexjimenez.com/3-health-benefits-walking-provides/) like walking around frequently. Another thing to take note of is that if there is swelling in the area that was injected is do not apply ice to the affected area and don't take [anti-inflammatory medications](https://dralexjimenez.com/enough-pain-medication-alternatives/) for at least 7 days since it can damage the injected cells or even kill them. As a substitute, a person can take Tylenol (acetaminophen) up to 4g daily or use a topical pain cream to ease the pain. As part of the normal healing process, a person may experience \u00e2\u20acRoller Coaster\u00e2\u20ac syndrome,\u00c2 where they feel great one day and for no apparent reason the area that was treated starts to hurt again. Don't Cause Inflammation In Your Body When a person injures themselves and the affected area is red and swollen, it is due to inflammation. [Studies show](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5805548) that inflammation is a defense mechanism that is responsive to the immune system. Inflammation help removes harmful pathogens and damaged cells of the body and initiates the healing process. Remember the [previous article](https://dralexjimenez.com/food-regenerative-perioperative-protocols-part-2/) talked about inflammation and how it is one of the biggest causes of unwanted health conditions. The way a person eats is one of the biggest ways that can cause unwanted inflammation in the body without even a person knowing it. If a person just received the treatment, it goes to the area of the body where there is inflammation. And if they eat foods that can trigger inflammation to rise more than it should then there will be consequences as some of the healing properties from the treatment will work on fixing the problem. Following a nutritional guide that doctors recommended [the anti-inflammatory diet](https://dralexjimenez.com/chiropractic-anti-inflammation-diet/), which is beneficial to the body as well as staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water. The closer a person is to following these guidelines the better chance of the body to recover. Rest, Don't Add Stress Getting enough rest and good sleep is vital. When people are getting enough sleep, the body and the mind are recovering. When having good quality sleep, [studies show](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5923838/) that getting an adequate amount of sleep can increase the quality of life and improve mental health, plus the treatment will be doing its job and make the body feel better. However, when there is stress in the body it can be hard for the body to relax and stress is another thing that is not healthy for the body and the mind. [Studies have found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7045300/) that sleep reactivity can cause stress exposure to disrupt sleep and cause unwanted issues that can make a person not feel 100 percent. There are four types of stress everybody commonly deals with. They are physical, emotional, nutritional, and chemical. Physical Many physicians want their patients to keep moving but patients need to pay attention to their body's reactions and do not do anything that causes [pain](https://dralexjimenez.com/chronic-back-pain-medical-condition/). Also, make sure to listen to their doctor\u00e2\u20acs advice on what to do and what not to do. [Pain relief](https://dralexjimenez.com/the-best-diet-for-pain-relief/) may be the first thing that anyone can notice in their recovery process. It is not an indication that a person is fully ready to get back to normal activities, however, if they overdo it, they may set back or ruin their chances of recovering. Emotional Since the [body and mind](https://dralexjimenez.com/functional-endocrinology-the-mind-body-connection-and-stress-part-1/) are connected if a person has a lot of emotional stress and it can affect their health and vice versa. By trying to avoid anything that may bring the mood down emotionally, having a\u00c2 positive mental outlook will go a long way in the recovery process. Nutritional People eat a lot of empty calories. which is a food or drink that does not have a lot of nutritional value. Remember the food that a person eats is fuel for the body. By putting [good fuel](https://dralexjimenez.com/superfoods-optimal-health/) in, the body will run well; but if a person consumes [bad food](https://dralexjimenez.com/health-risks-genetically-modified-foods/), the body will not run properly. Please eat only nutrient-dense or nutrient-rich food. There are many resources online to help give people a better understanding of what foods to choose. The body and the treatment need good fuel to get the best result possible. Chemical Everyone is exposed to literally tens of thousands of chemicals, toxins, and pollutants on a weekly basis. They are in the air that people breathe, the food that is eaten, and even the things people use to wash their clothes and bodies. Everything around the world is heavy in these chemicals, toxins, and pollutants. Try and lower [endocrine disruptor exposure](https://dralexjimenez.com/detoxify-strategies-endocrine-disruptors-part-1/) as much as possible, especially with the foods that are being eaten. By trying to eat freshly prepared organic foods whenever possible, can increase the chances of recovery. Conclusion All in all, these step-by-step guidelines are essential for the recovery process of regenerative treatment. By following these guidelines can help the body recover faster and provide optimal results for the body. Regenerative medicine has many beneficial properties when it comes to body health and wellness since it helps repair the cellular structure of the body. When the body is functioning properly and is healthy, a person can continue on their wellness journey and is much happier.
