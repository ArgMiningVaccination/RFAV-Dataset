Unlimited Seats This license extends our regular Royalty Free / Editorial license to an unlimited number of seats within the same organization. It is an additional license to the usage included within the regular Royalty-Free / Editorial license that awards rights for a single person within the same company. The U-EL license is applied only for the staff of the organization that holds the account. The number of copies allowed is unlimited for each designer/employee. Web Usage Electronic Items for Resale/Distribution: this license includes the right to use the media in webtemplates that are sold to more customers, screensavers, e-cards, powerpoint presentations or as wallpapers on cell phones. Maximum number of electronic items is unlimited (applies as a total of each type of usage). This is an additional license to the rights included within the regular Royalty-Free license. Note that the other restrictions still apply. Print usage Physical Items for Resale/Distribution: includes the right to use the photos or stills comprising media for T-shirts, postcards, greeting cards, mugs, mousepads, posters, calendars, framed artwork that is to be sold to other customers for an unlimited number of copies (applies as a total of each type of usage). This is an additional license to the rights included within the regular Royalty-Free license. Note that the other restrictions still apply. Time Limited Exclusivity This license represents an exclusive right to use the downloaded media, but such exclusivity will only last for a limited period of time. The buyer can use the media exclusively (exclusivity applies from the moment that the file was downloaded using this license) during the time period selected, and include it in any type of design with just a few restrictions: sensitive subjects may still apply and the buyer may not claim that the file was created by him nor resell it as his work [photo/media]. Dreamstime will disable the image immediately after the buyer acquired this license. The Contributor will be required to disable the file permanently from all other places where he or she may sell it, as soon as possible after the sale occured, but no longer than 72 hours. The Contributor acknowledges and agrees to provide the buyer with the exclusive right to use the file retrieved using the SR-EL1 or SR-EL3 licenses, for the duration of the selected exclusivity period. The length of time for the exclusivity period depends on which license is selected. SR-EL1 will grant an exclusive right to use the media for one year. Similarly, SR-EL3 will grant an exclusive right to use the image for three years. The print run for both licenses is unlimited and continues after the exclusivity expired. At the end of the exclusivity period, the buyer`s license will continue as before, with all of the same rights, except for the right of exclusivity, and the image will again be added to the available library of media on Dreamstime.com and again be made available to all users for purchase. After the end of the exclusivity period, the Contributor will also be free to offer the media for download from other places where the Contributor sells his or her media.

Sell the rights This license represents a full ownership of the downloaded media. The buyer can use it exclusively (exclusivity applies from the moment that the file was downloaded using this license; buyer must take into account potential past downloads made for media and choose it accordingly or investigate further via support), and include it in any type of design with just a few restrictions: sensitive subjects may still apply and the buyer may not claim that the file was created by him nor resell it as his work. The agency will disable the media immediately after the buyer acquired this license. The Contributor is required to disable the file permanently from all other places where he may sell it, as soon as possible after the sale occurred, but no longer than 72 hours. This license grants the buyer exclusivity so the Contributor needs to keep in mind that exclusive media is represented by concepts, models, wardrobe, and subject matter which provide a unique creative message and small variations in the image (variations in camera angle, model posture or gesture, for example) do not enable other files as being different. All such variations rendering the media very similar in concept and message to the one sold under SR-EL should be removed from sale as well. The photographer acknowledge and agrees to provide the buyer with full ownership for the file retrieved using the SR-EL license.
