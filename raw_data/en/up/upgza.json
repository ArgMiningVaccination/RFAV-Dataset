Personally, I am a more content person in every way when I am in sync with my mental, emotional and spiritual needs. I am truer than true, I laugh and live fully and nothing and no one phases me on those days. How does that happen? When we honour and respect our emotional needs, our spiritual needs are also satisfied. Spirituality does not have to be about sitting down for prayer or meditation. What it means is being wholly present whatever you are doing and wherever you are at. When we are tuning into our emotional needs and fulfilling what it needs at that time - be it a laugh, a cry, a cuddle, or some alone time, we perform better on an emotional level also. We have released those pent up emotions and worries and are ready to regroup ourselves to move forward. By not being true to ourselves, we often find that we are unhappy in the moment, or not fully present. We are agitated and out of sorts. Whatever it is you want, ask yourself that - wait for the answer. It will come to you and respect that decision. A no, should mean a no and not a yes! It's liberating to be in one with our emotional and mental needs because you will find yourself feeling more in balance and lifted everyday. "}
