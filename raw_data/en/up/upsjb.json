Although only 5 to 10 percent of sore throats are strep throat, up to 15 percent of doctor's visits for a sore throat are due to strep. In the paediatric ward in hospitals infection control and prevention is very important. Service users in hospital are much more prone to infections and diseases as they are already unwell therefore extra precautions are always taken. This includes service providers ensuring that their vaccinations are up to date, working in a 1. Are you aware of HAIs in your hospital? Yes or No 2. Which of the following of HAIs are commonly seen in your hospital Urinary tract infections Surgical wound infections Respiratory tract infections Bloodstream infection Others, specify 3. Which of the following infectious agents are commonly involved in HAIS MRSA VRE P. aeruginosa Rotavirus Influenza flu E. coli 4. Can you mention at least 5 pathogens most Workers in nuclear medicine should follow safety rules. While working with radioactive materials, personal protective equipment like gloves, protective eye wear and cloths and in some cases fume hoods must be used. NM procedures must be practiced in special closed places. Moreover, radioactive materials and their equipment are only used in the authorized areas in the hospital. The occupational dose for the worker must not exceed 6 mSv/year. Through the learning from week 1 and week 2, I have learnt that the most frequent adverse event in health-care delivery is health care-associated infections. It is essential for us to follow the infection control practices that both patients and us are at a risk of being infected. Standard Precautions involve the use of safe work practices and protective barriers, for example, the use of personal protective equipment(PPE). At first, I think Standard Precautions are very easy. Everyone knows PPE can protect us from infections and hand hygiene is important throughout the process. However, what I ignored and did wrong were the correct sequences of wearing PPE and how to use them correctly. The sequences are totally different when taking on and A person who touches something with the infection on it and afterward touches his or her mouth, eyes or nose can get to be contaminated. It is the belief of many medical professionals that proper safety protocols in the medical environment is paramount. There is nothing more important in a hospital setting than overall safety. This goes for both patient safety as well as the safety of the hospital staff. Both patient and staff have their own precautions that must be taken and steps that must be followed to ensure there are no mishaps. Infection control refers to action devoted to policies and procedures that reduce the risk of spreading infections, reduce the occurrence of diseases caused by bacteria and viruses, parasite. The infectious diseases are normally spread by human to human, human to animal contact or by ingestion of food, droplet in the air, and contact with a surface that is the vehicle of the infective agent. H1N1, commonly known as the swine flu, a viral infection, was a cause of 2009 world-wide pandemic. The virus was first found in pigs, but a similar virus also found in humans. The virus spreads in a same manner as any other seasonal flu, mainly by droplets (small particles in the air) when an infected person coughs, sneezes or even talks, but also by touching Staphylococcus epidermidis is the organism that was identified based on the tests that I had conducted. The tests that I used to identify this organism were the coagulase test and the catalase test. My bacterium was beta hemolytic as well. First, a gram stain had to be done to determine whether the organism was a gram positive organism or a gram negative organism. This determined which set of tests that had to be done. My bacterium turned out to be gram positive. When conducting these tests, I only had to do the coagulase test and the catalase test because when doing the catalase test, the reaction was that it had bubbled. If it did not bubble, or have a positive reaction, then I would not have had to do the coagulase test. Also, since my bacterium caused a positive catalase test, I only had to do the coagulase test and no other tests. This is because with staphylococcus organisms, these are the only tests \"Wild Geese\" by Mary Oliver is a poem about letting things go and appreciating just how simple and beautiful life is. Oliver claims that \"You do not have to be good...\" and that you only have to \"love what [you] love...\" meaning that as human being one should enjoy life and live it how he or she sees fit. Oliver continues her poem by convincing the reader that life should not be taken too seriously. By re-using the word, \"meanwhile...\"Oliver let's the reader know that not only their life is going on at a particular time, but also other's lives are shifting through time as well. It's easy to get sick in a hospital, but we often forget that our phones are something we never view as \"dirty\". Are our hands ever clean? When we wash our hands, and then touch our phone it basically defeats the purpose. Now thinking of this in the hospital setting could be tragic. If the nurse is going to patient to patient touching doorknobs then allowing the patient to touch the same tablet, they put their life at risk. What if the patient has an immune deficiency and then they are exposed to a bacteria on the screen of the tablet. Tablets can put a picture in front of the patient, but we may be risking more than that by the spreading of bacteria and diseases. Radiologists recently have been advanced because of radiology expanding practices in many sensitive medical cases. Recent charges against radiologists have brought new obligations and liabilities, making them vulnerable to higher degrees of legal cases against them. Negligence legal proceedings in radiology naturally appear as a result of failure to diagnosis or poor consultation and thus failure to react medically in a timely manner. A great percentage of radiologists are liable to face a claim every five years. Radiologists confront not high risks of malpractice suits if compare with other specialists. The most common medical lawsuits against radiologists are misdiagnosis of breast cancer on mammography and lung cancer. Clinical governance ensures that organisations become accountable for continuously improving their services and safe-guarding standard of care 'by creating an environment in which excellence in clinical care will flourish' (Scally and Donaldson 1998). Clinical audit emerged from within the clinical governance framework and is now seen as one of the most important elements of clinical governance (NICE 2002); it has been defined as 'a quality improvement process that seeks to improve patient care and outcomes through systematic review against explicit criteria and the implementation of change'. The student intends to focus this audit on staff knowledge in relation to Hand Hygiene and Infection Control and to evaluate the hand hygiene education Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) is one of the most important agents in the prevention of hospital acquired infections or what we termed nosocomial infections. IPC channels every member of the hospital, which includes, healthcare providers (HCP), patients and the hospitals perse. It is important to practice IPC commandment to every hospital as well as community. The Palestinian Ministry of Health (MOH) adopted the national IPC protocol. Employees working in pediatrics hospital are supposed to take precautions to protect their patients and staff from exposure to potentially infectious materials. A fundamental component of standard infection prevention measures are a system of barrier precautions to be used by all personnel INTRODUCTION: Quick look at your hands do you see them. (attention) Do I see what you might be asking? Well the millions of bacteria that are currently hanging out on your hands. (credibility) I am here today to focus in on how you can protect yourself from these invisible killers. Probably the single most repeated thing in my nursing classes has been hand washing. (rapport) You might be thinking well I am not a nursing student so this does not apply to me, but I hope to prove to you the importance of washing your hands several times a day. The problem I want to focus on is that many people don't wash their hands, people need to wash their hands, and you should wash your hands many times a day. (preview) "}
