Eczema (eg-zuh-MUH) is an inflammatory skin condition that causes itchiness, dry skin, rashes, scaly patches, blisters and skin infections. Itchy skin is the most common symptom of eczema. There are seven different types million Americans have some form of eczema. Eczema can begin during childhood, adolescence, or adulthood - and it can range from mild to severe. Newborn babies can experience eczema within the first weeks and months after birth. Young children with eczema can experience patches of skin that are extremely dry; itchy skin that can lead to blisters and skin infections due to excessive scratching. Adults can also experience eczema and adult eczema is most commonly developed when someone is in their 20s or over the age of 50. Many people with eczema use the phrase \"flare-up\" to describe a phase of eczema when they are experiencing one or more acute symptoms or side effects from prolonged itchiness; severe eczema may include periods of flare-ups that can last many days or even several weeks. Moisturizers, antihistamines, topical steroid creams and corticosteroids are among the potential courses of [ eczema treatments](https://nationaleczema.org/eczema/treatment/) usually recommended by healthcare providers, dermatologists and the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). Sometimes eczema is confused with other skin diseases, like psoriasis, so it's important to get a diagnosis. A dermatologist or other qualified healthcare professional will also have expert knowledge on treatment options-and they're often an invaluable partner in developing your symptom management plan and in stopping future flare-ups. What is atopic dermatitis? Atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema (sometimes referred to as \"atopic eczema\"), results from an overactive immune system that causes the skin barrier to become dry and itchy.

Many people with eczema often report comorbid symptoms of hay fever, allergic asthma and food allergies. Proper, consistent skin care is essential in the prevention and management of eczema. What are the causes of eczema? Atopic dermatitis (sometimes referred to as \"atopic eczema\") is the most common type of eczema. It results from an overactive immune system that causes the skin barrier to become dry and itchy. This condition can occur on any part of the body and has varied symptoms. Many factors can contribute to eczema, including an interaction between your environment and your genes. When an irritant or an allergen from outside or inside the body \"switches on\" the immune system, it produces inflammation, or a flare-up, on the surface of the skin. This inflammation causes the symptoms common to most types of eczema. Creases of the skin, especially the flexural areas behind the knees, elbows, lower legs and other areas of skin that rub against each other can lead to irritation. There is also a potential genetic component to eczema that includes a protein called \"filaggrin\" that helps maintain moisture in your skin; a [ filaggrin deficiency](about:blank) can lead to drier, itchier skin. If you have family members with atopic dermatitis and certain other types of eczema, you may be at an increased risk. Along with having a family history of eczema, many common household items are also potential environmental irritants and can cause allergic reactions leading to an eczema flare. Additional common triggers of eczema may include: - extended exposure to dry air, extreme heat or cold - some types of soap, shampoos that cause dander, bubble bath products, body wash, and facial cleansers - laundry detergents and fabric softeners with chemical additives - certain fabrics like wool or polyester in clothing and sheets - surface cleaners and disinfectants - natural liquids like the juice from fruit, vegetables and meats - fragrances in candles - metals, especially nickel, in jewelry or utensils - formaldehyde, which is found in household disinfectants, some vaccines, glues and adhesives - isothiazolinone, an antibacterial found in personal care products like baby wipes - cocamidopropyl betaine, which is used to thicken shampoos and lotions - paraphenylene-diamine, which is used in leather dyes and temporary tattoos - dust mites and living in dirty spaces To avoid being triggered by a household product, make sure to use products with the [ National Eczema Association Seal of AcceptanceTM](https://nationaleczema.org/eczema-products/). Emotional stress can also trigger an eczema flare-up, but it's not exactly known why. Some people's eczema symptoms and flare-ups get worse when they're feeling \"stressed.\" Others may become stressed, just knowing they have eczema, and this can make their skin flare up. Is eczema contagious? Eczema is not contagious. You can't \"catch it\" from someone else.
