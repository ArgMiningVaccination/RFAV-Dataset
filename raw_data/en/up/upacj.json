It's something that the mainstream sees as dorky or embarrassing. But, it's surprisingly common. About 24% of adults suffer from some kind of [foot issue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3132870/)[1], and this percentage only increases with age. Luckily, brands like [OrthoFeet](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes) exist to help you out. OrthoFeet is an orthopedic footwear company that offers men and women comfort and pain relief for 20 + different ailments. The brand is committed to both high-quality solutions and top-notch customer service in the hopes that getting help with their products is as easy as walking in them. This [OrthoFeet](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes) shoes review will take a look at some of their popular footwear, promotions, customer reviews, and more, so that you can decide if OrthoFeet is the solution for you. Overview of OrthoFeet [OrthoFeet ](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes)started producing orthopedic shoes in 2000 but brothers Ron and Michael Bar established OrthoFeet Inc. in New Jersey way back in 1984. The origins are more traumatic than your average shoe company: Ron had lost his leg in the Yom Kippur war of 1973, and was unimpressed with the hassle and inaccuracy of the casting process used for orthotics. Ron struggled with his lack of mobility and discomfort for years as a veteran. After receiving a doctorate in biomedical engineering, he and Michael, who has a master's in mechanical engineering, teamed up to design insoles and foot orthotics that would mold to the patient's foot. This would remove the need for the difficulties of the casting process and provide a more accurate and effective product. 16 years later, OrthoFeet took their experience with this patented technology and created a line of comfort orthopedic shoes. These are aimed to give fashionable comfort and support to people struggling with a range of issues, including: - Achilles tendon pain - Arthritis - Back pain - Ball of foot pain/Metatarsalgia - Bunions - Diabetes - Flat feet - Foot pain - Hammer toes - Heel pain/spurs - Knee & hip pain - Morton's neuroma - Neuropathy - Overpronation - Plantar fasciitis - Swollen feet/edema - Gout in foot OrthoFeet Technology So what is orthotic footwear? It's a shoe style that prioritizes functionality with a host of health benefits for multiple parts of our bodies. Mainly, orthotic footwear can reduce pain in our feet, ankles, knees, legs, and lower back. Not all orthotic footwear is the same. Each pair focuses on comfort, but comfort is not one-size-fits-all. As such, orthotic footwear can change depending on foot sizes and shapes, their intended sport, surfaces, and materials. And not all orthotic footwear brands can be OrthoFeet, though they might want to be. Only OrthoFeet uses the patented Ortho-Cushion system; a tri-layer insole that provides arch support, cushioning, and pain relief. Plus, the layers are breathable so that foot stink won't get trapped in the sole. The Ortho-Cushion's top layer molds to your foot for sublime support. It's what many folks are searching for when they want arch support. The cushion's middle layer provides extra padding so hard surfaces like concrete don't irritate your joints. Finally, the bottom layer sticks to the back of the foot to slightly elevate the heel and reduce pain. Together, these layers can absorb impacts from walking, running, and jumping. Before I get into some bestsellers, here's a quick look at key points in this [OrthoFeet ](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes)shoes review: Highlights - Positive customer reviews - Competitive prices - Shoes available for men and women in a range of types, widths, and sizes - Attractive and stylish options available - Products are suited to a wide range of foot ailments - Products are developed with the input of doctors and biomedical engineers - Sales and promotions offered - Experts are available to help you find the right shoes for you - 60-day wear test, with free returns, and exchanges - Free shipping within the US This OrthoFeet shoes review will focus on a selection of their more popular footwear across both the men's and women's collections. Let's dive in! OrthoFeet Men's Shoes Review Men shopping for [OrthoFeet shoes](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes) can look through six collections: sneakers/athletic, casual, dress, boots, sandals, and slippers. The athletic and casual sections have the most options, with the others having just a few each. Most OrthoFeet shoes for men are available in suede or full grain leather, with blacks and browns being the common color choices. OrthoFeet's MO with their shoes is a lot of padding in the sole, padding in the heel, and really just padding everywhere. Metatarsal pads (or pads for the bones of the feet) have been shown to be effective in [reducing foot pain](https://www.eymj.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3349/ymj.2022.63.9.864)[5]. This feature is great for comfort and pain relief, but it does have the side effect of making the shoes less conventionally attractive. Some models are downright bulky. There's a bit of a trade-off when it comes to comfort and aesthetics. OrthoFeet Gemini Sandals Review The [Gemini Sandals](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes), which also come in charcoal, are the closest [OrthoFeet](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes) gets to regular sandals (the other options have more of a water shoe look to them). The Gemini Sandals are made from leather and uses OrthoFeet's Ortho Cushion system, which is a constant. The leather straps on the Gemini Sandals have a layer of cushioning on the bottom, combined with a stretching material to remove pressure points and increase comfort. Studies have shown that foot pain is associated with [toe pressure](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25995291/)[6], so taking some of this away could help with the pain. As a plus, these sandals are easy to put on and remove with a wide opening for your foot. These OrthoFeet sandals are great for walking around, doing errands, or going about your day when the weather's hot and shoes just feel too constrained. The Gemini Sandals are offered at $104.95 (normally $130.00), which seems like a small price to pay for long-term relief. You can get this pair in medium (regular), wide, and extra wide. Customers say: \"These sandals are the most comfortable I've ever worn..I am size 12 4W straps are a breeze to put on... I highly recommend these.I love them because you can adjust the straps..my feet swell so that really helps at times.\" OrthoFeet Tacoma Stretch Knit Review The [OrthoFeet Tacoma Stretch Knit](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes) was designed to be a seriously comfortable walking shoe, and reviewers indicate that they're great for running, as well. In addition to the standard Ortho Cushion system, the synthetic shoe has a stretchable padded upper to reduce pressure on the foot from above. You can pull off a substantial sole on an athletic shoe better compared to casual or dress types\u2014even with all the padded support, the [Tacoma](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes) has a sleek and contemporary look with the all-white sole and black mesh upper. The Tacoma walking shoe is only available in black and sells for $114.95 from $140, which is marginally lower than most orthopedic shoe brands. You can get these OrthoFeet shoes in medium (regular), wide, and extra wide. Customers say: \"Only shoe I have found that I can wear all day for work and play and still wear in me recliner, without my neuropathy making me take them off.\" OrthoFeet Baton Rouge Shoes Review The [OrthoFeet Baton Rouge Shoes](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes) is one of [OrthoFeet](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes)'s more modern designs, capitalizing on the consistently popular boat shoe. They've done fairly well with it, considering it has substantially more padding than the average boat shoe. The sand colour scheme blends the upper and sole parts of the leather shoe, so this extra padding is subtle. These low-key Baton Rouge shoes are a nice casual option that combines OrthoFeet's comfort and support with boat shoe design features. The shoes are also available in a deeper brown with black accents, though this model calls more attention to the bulky heel. The price of $104,95 from $145 puts the [Baton Rouge Shoes](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes) in pretty much the same tier relative to other orthopedic casual shoe options. These boat shoes are available in medium (regular), wide, and extra wide. Customers say: \"I buy these shoes for my husband once to twice a year. I have them on a rotation, One for out side, one for inside and one for events. I do the same for Ortho's Tuscany slippers. My husband is a big guy and these give him the best comfort.\" OrthoFeet Zodiac Shoes Review Class, elegance and comfort, that's what [OrthoFeet](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes) seeks with [Zodiac](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes) shoes. The buckle and subtle shine of the leather offer sophistication to the Zodiac shoes. The sole is a little more rounded than dress shoes tend to be, and OrthoFeet's wide toe boxes are most noticeable in the dress shoe category. But again, with comfort being such a priority, it's natural that these shoes look a bit different. Shoes that don't fit properly are a major cause of foot pain, so don't be afraid to go for this wider fit as it could bring you a ton of relief. One [study](https://jfootankleres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13047-018-0284-z)[7] showed that a whopping 63 to 72% of people wear shoes that don't fit either the length or the width of their feet. The [Zodiac](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes) puts the Ortho Cushion system into a buckled dress shoe selling for $104.95 from $145, available in medium (regular), wide, and extra wide. Customers say: \"Truly a great shoe. Good fit and very comfortable. Have been wearing them indoors all day because I need a stable footwear and they are like wearing a soft pair of slippers. Definitely would recommend them.\" OrthoFeet Women's Shoes [OrthoFeet](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes)'s shoes for women are available in eight categories, offering more type variety compared to the men's line. Their collections include sneakers/athletic, casual, dress, boots, sandals, heels/pumps, Mary Janes, and slippers. The women's collection also features the patented [Ortho ](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes)Cushioning system, with a mix of synthetic and leather models. The trade off of losing sleekness to gain padding still remains, but that's a debate for you to have. OrthoFeet Verona Heel Strap Review The [Verona Heel Strap](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes) are [OrthoFeet](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes)'s take on a comfortable walking sandal for women, with a feminine flare offered by the pewter metallic finish. This pair offers plenty of support with padding around the heel and in the upper resting on top of the cushioned sole. It's designed primarily for function, but that doesn't mean it isn't stylish for a walking sandal. I envision the Verona Heel Strap for a summer stroll along the boardwalk or while touring a new city on your travels. Would these Verona sandals look out of place in Verona? Well, it's decidedly not a European look, but it'll keep you from experiencing a painful stride that would put a damper on your exploring. Selling for $94.95 from $125, the Verona is decently priced for a good quality orthopedic sandal. It's only available in pewter, but you have your choice of medium (regular), wide, and extra wide to choose the fit that's best for you. Customers say: \"I love these closed-toe sandals! They are comfortable, versatile and are now my \"go-to sandals\" for wearing with shorts or Spring/Summer dresses.\" Stretch Knit Review The [OrthoFeet Joelle Stretch Knit](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes) has the look of a running shoe but it falls into both the athletic and casual categories, while it can benefit pain relief for long walks. It uses a strap instead of laces and is available in black and silver. As with the men's category, the athletic shoes have the least problems combining style with the extra padding. It's actually quite a modern shoe thanks to the mesh upper region and synthetics. The [Joelle Stretch Knit](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes) shoes is decently priced at $104.95 from $135, and has an impressive width variety: you have the choice between medium, large, extra large, and extra extra large width. Customers say: \"I have super wide feet with bad metatarsals, and most wide shoes still aren't wide enough with socks. I can wear these with my own orthotics and socks and the extra little plastic thing makes them even better.\" OrthoFeet Emma Booties Review The [OrthoFeet Emma](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes) heeled booties are as subtle as they come with their orthodic padding. They masquerade as typical low-rise boots with unseen comfort. Wedge heels are generally more comfortable compared to a slimmer heel, but these boots offer next level relief with OrthoFeet technology. These [OrthoFeet](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes) boots are easy to slip on and off with the elastic and zipper sides, while the buckle is an attractive aesthetic feature. The black leather has a subtle shine and will only complement your outfit, rather than being the main feature. The Emma 2\" booties have a synthetic inner layer that adds extra padding, paired with a comfortable wide toe box. The [OrthoFeet Emma](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes) high heel booties are priced at $119.95 from $150, which is expected for orthopedic tech, combined with quality leather. These OrthoFeet boots are available in medium and wide. Customers say: \"Cute and comfy, Perfect for me since I am unable to wear heels.\" Orthofeet Chelsea Shoes Review The [Orthofeet Chelsea](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes) shoes is a classic women's dress shoe, for ladies who just aren't into wearing heels\u2014The padded leather strap offers more comfort at the expense of being a delicate shoe, but it offers an attractive middle ground. They're charming yet understated, with the Ortho technology and foot support needed to dance the night away, attend a dinner party, or wear to the office. The [Orthofeet Chelsea](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes) dress shoes also come in a glossy crocodile pattern, which makes more of a statement and infuses some edginess into the formal look. At $104.95 from $140, the price is definitely not exorbitant for a leather dress shoe. These padded slip-on shoes come in medium, wide, extra wide, and extra extra wide. Customers say: \"These shoes are sooooo comfortable. It is like wearing my slippers to work. I only wish they came in more colors besides just black. I would definitely recommend these shoes!\" OrthoFeet Reviews: What Do Customers Think? Are [OrthoFeet ](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes)shoes good? That's the main question of this OrthoFeet shoes review. Customers are positive about their effects: you can feel the relief coming through in many of them. Of course, shoes are a finicky area and there are some who find no benefit but, overall, there are a lot more both on OrthoFeet's site and on Amazon who praise them highly. Here are some average customer review scores taken from OrthoFeet's website: - OrthoFeet Cambria Sandals: 5/5 stars based on more than 200 pieces of customer feedback - OrthoFeet Verona Heel Strap - Pewter: 4.5/5 stars based on more than 880 pieces of customer feedback - OrthoFeet Joelle Stretch Knit - Black: 4.5/5 stars based on more than 275 pieces of customer feedback Speaking of relief, that's what many loved about their OrthoFeet Shoes. Here's how one customer described the shoe's feel on Better Business Bureau; \"These shoes, Orthofeet, are as good as or better than all of them. They are supportive, and have great cushion for heel pain.\" Other shoppers loved the style of OrthoFeet shoes. They said they were the best compromise between fashion and function. One customer wrote the following on Trust Pilot. \"I have always had problem feet and had trouble finding shoes that were comfortable - until I found Orthofeet. Their shoes are sooo comfortable. For the first time in my life I have multiple pairs of shoes instead of just two or three pair. I particularly love their sandals that are comfortable AND stylish.\" Plenty of OrthoFeet customers also felt like they could wear the shoes for hours without feeling pain. This was great for customers who worked jobs that required them to remain standing for most of the day, so nurses and customer service workers especially appreciated them. Here's another buyer review from Trust Pilot. \"I've tried so many brands and kinds of shoes but orthofeet shoes is the best. It so comfortable for my feet specially when I have to be on my feet 8-10 hours in any given day. Fits well for the size I ordered. No regrets for buying it. It's a bit pricey but it's worth it. Bought a sneaker for my wife and she loves it.\" Furthermore, OrthoFeet's generous return policy and customer service were frequently praised. Shopper felt safe knowing that they could return any products they didn't like without losing an investment. Don't take that as me saying customers didn't like OrthoFeet, just that sometimes people bought the wrong size and had to return them. Another customer provided this in-depth explanation of OrthoFeet's return policy: \"Orthofeet is the easiest company to deal with that I have ever ordered from and I shop almost exclusively through the internet. If, for any reason, you do not like the item you ordered you can return it and shipping back is free. I have returned three pair of shoes (although have kept eight) primarily because I didn't like how they looked or the fit wasn't perfect. Every pair I have purchased is SO comfortable, especially if you have any issues with your feet at all.\" The main concern some customers raised in their OrthoFeet reviews was that the shoes didn't fit the same as other brands. However, OrthoFeet does have a handy note on each shoe as to whether you should order a size up or not. I'll conclude this section of my OrthoFeet Shoes review with this final customer testimonial. \"I have purchased three pair of shoes for three different trips: NYC, Iceland and Scotland. The boots for Iceland were perfect for walking and keeping my feet warm and dry. The grey high top shoes were for walking around NYC and I am going to tell you even when we covered five miles my back, legs and feet felt great. The blue one are for Scotland this spring, but so far I love them too as I walk in them before the trip.\" Are OrthoFeet Shoes Worth It? That's the big question in this [OrthoFeet](https://shop.honestbrandreviews.com/orthofeet-shoes) review. Their footwear is designed so that people with wider feet can enjoy contemporary styles like boat shoes and high heels. Consider that most shoe manufacturers don't put too much thought into how the shoes feel on your feet. OrthoFeet is different. Their shoes have arch support and cushioning so you should feel comfortable in them all day long. Plus, they're not much pricier than other shoes on the market, so overall, OrthoFeet's products are definitely worth checking out.
