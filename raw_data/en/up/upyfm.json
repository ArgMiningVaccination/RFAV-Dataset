This unique course is currently the only MSc in nutritional therapy in the country fully accredited by the NTC (Nutritional Therapy Council). The course is validated by Middlesex University and consists of two years of part time study in College (for the course starting in 2011 this will be two weekdays a month in term time) to complete the Diploma, and then optionally for the MSc up to two years of autonomous research and writing up of the MSc dissertation, with support from a personal supervisor. On completion of the Diploma our students can register with the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC), join the British Association of Nutritional Therapists (BANT) and work as a nutritional therapist On this Masters level course our students learn to use evidence-based nutritional research and apply it directly in practice. The emphasis is on eating for health rather than just taking supplements, and our students develop highly effective and safe skills for clinical practice. The course is highly integrated with clinical practice in our teaching clinic from the outset. The 'functional medicine' approach taught takes the underlying causes of illness into account, rather than just treating the symptoms, thus further enhancing our students' ability to get to the root cause of patients' problems. We also teach nutritional approaches from different traditional systems of medicine, and run workshops by inspirational leaders in the nutritional therapy field. The course is open to healthcare practitioners and to people who already have a degree (or equivalent); a foundation course is available in the summer to provide students starting in the October with science basics and clinical skills..

As a natural but 'rare' sugar, we don't get enough of it in the modern diet, because we don't eat the foods - mosses, seaweeds, leaves, raw vegetables and roots that contain L-Arabinose. This leads to an imbalance, with an excess in the modern diet of sugars that rapidly breakdown to glucose. The result is a 'sugar rush' when we eat, and a rapid rise in blood-sugar levels. Blood-sugar spiking indirectly causes all sorts of problems from obesity to Diabetes Type II, because once the sugar-rush has faded we get hungry again and tend to eat too much. Often the matter is made worse because low blood-sugar makes us want to eat sweet things, which starts that cycle all over again. When the sugar-rush from eating reaches a particular level, our body realizes we are not going to need the glycogen we already have stored in our liver, and converts that excess glycogen into fat for long-term storage. This is the root cause of obesity. When people claim \"It's my metabolism...\" they are correct. But breaking the fat storage cycle effectively changes the metabolism. Since available energy drops and appetite increases as soon as glycogen begins to be stored as fat and blood-glucose levels begin to fall, the process of stabilizing blood-sugar levels allows us to use stored glycogen as energy. When energy is available from stored glycogen, we don't get hungry. The process is simple - when we are less hungry, we eat less. When we use the energy stored as glycogen, we don't store it as fat. Gradually getting blood-sugar levels under control returns the body to a natural balance, especially when combined with a healthy lifestyle.

Its initial cohort of doctors and nurses will graduate in the Study of Integrative Medicine (DipSIM) in March 2012, with the first ever British postgraduate degree qualification in Integrative Medicine. Dr Soh\u00e8re Roked (1) a student at the British College of Integrative Medicine defines Integrative Medicine as a \"healing-orientated approach that emphasises the patient-practitioner relationship, focusing on the least invasive, least toxic, and least expensive methods, integrating both allopathic and complementary approaches to facilitate health\". Dr Roked, who works as a registrar in a busy GP practice in Bridgend, South Wales, will be one of the first to graduate from BCIM, and she says it's already altered her practice for the better. The full Diploma is a two-year, part-time course, with other flexible study opportunities available (assessed or unassessed) for doctors, nurses and other graduate healthcare professionals who are invited to apply now for the next course, starting October 2011. Fellow student Dr Rory McGill full time GP in Plymouth for 17 years, was growing frustrated by the limits of the biomedical model and has now set up his own private practice as an holistic doctor.

In this new book Walker gives a full and detailed picture of the vested interests, their personalities, organisations and ideas that have shaped the present attack on alternatives in the field of health. Alternatives and complimentary medicine is under attack on all fronts, The Handbook gives us the knowledge with which to defend ourselves and fight back. History 1985-2008: Attacks and battles between Quackbusters and Natural Medicine Practitioners; Health Corporatists: Influential Individuals, Organizations, their Profiles and links to Government Groups, Projects, Committees, Attacks, Media Battles Websites: Quackbuster and Corporate Science Skeptic The Antidote: Free Thinkers, Campaigners, Natural Health Champions Martin Walker names the powerful scientists, politicians and media celebrities who have been involved with the financial support of organizations deliberately tasked with the suppression, defamation and indeed obliteration of complementary and alternative medicine. Dirty Medicine The Handbook illuminates the details and individuals behind the scandals which form major threads in Martin Walker's book, including the trial of Dr Andrew Wakefield before the General Medical Council, the legal challenges by Dr Simon Singh against the British Chiropractic Association, and the many venomous campaigns against homeopathic medicines. Martin also reveals through his research and political analysis, major media players and organizations and their funding. Martin Walker describes the Alice through the Looking Glass phenomenon whereby everything you thought went one way was reported to be the opposite way as Truth Reversal - an excellent alternative term to the plain old lie. Of doctors, epidemiologists, researchers, advisers, insurance scammers, quackbusters, bad journalists, corporate scientists, industry shills and other agents who do now or have in the past worked for, sided with, supported or simply been a part of corporate interests, manufacturing, pushing or promoting, products or ideologies antagonistic to the private and public health of workers, consumers, citizens, patients, alternative practitioners and science in the public interest; who they are, how to recognize them and their organizations, and what to do about them.
