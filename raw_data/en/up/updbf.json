The doctor did a Very thorough assessment asked some good questions and gave me a good adjustment. He did not push as some chiropractors do for long and regular appointments. He showEd me some at home exercises. I will be back as I highly recommend the Center. - 10/22/2022 Enjoyed my first visit. I am definitely returning and will be a regular client. Not only did I get my back, neck, & ankles adjusted but I learned so much about what a chiropractor is and do. And how the body works and why it does what it do. And isn't shy to discuss the pharmaceutical world and how the body can naturally heal itself. He was able to work with me through my limitations and still get the job done since I am pregnant. He also was about to take what I thought was normal of my body and make some adjustments to it and even show me placements and movements that were off or not working and fix it! He was gentle and super knowledgeable. I wasn't left with any unexpectations because he kept me informed throughout the session and gave me a home care paper to maintain the work that has been done. I highly recommend. - 12/3/2019 Yesterday was my first visit to Balance Chiropractic Health Center. The massage started slightly late only about 5 minutes, but I think it was due to the client before me, not a fault of the studio. I found the facility via Groupon and purchased the $56 1 hour sport massage (normally $110). Although I've been getting regular massages for several years, this was my first sports massage. I am very active with my upper body and constantly have knots near my shoulder blades, soreness around my scapula and general just tenseness from my upper back, shoulders, traps and neck. I relayed all this information to my therapist, Nick. I thoroughly enjoyed my massage and the deep work we were able to accomplish through his techniques, and my breathing. The pressure may be a bit much for most, but I do think if you have tense muscles from activity as an athlete, you need this pressure to truly accomplish the myofascial release. I felt that Nick really focused on the areas I asked him to, told me to breathe deeply when I needed to, and took a lot of time and detail on focused muscle groups. I walked out feeling so much more refreshed and loose than when I had walked in. I also saw they had signs posted on the wall that you can purchase Groupons directly from them. I think I'll take them up on that offer and get another sports massage next month! I'll update my review accordingly - 9/11/2017 The front desk table looks like a bar...weird. Anyway, the receptionist was very nice in greeting and letting you know who will be meeting you. It was my first time there for a sports massage and it was quite interesting. I think I even took a cat nap in-between because it was very relaxing. But I'm not sure if it was a \"sport massage\", it just felt like a regular mediocre massage. I did hope that all parts of the body got treated equally instead of focusing on the back most of the time. - 1/14/2019 Making appointments was easy (I had made one previously but had to cancel) and purchased a Groupon for this visit. Upon arriving for my deep tissue massage, I was excited about the tea bar with all the retail options for tinctures, salts and teas for relaxation. It doubles also as a chiropractic office and a spa downstairs. I was offered water before my appointment. I went downstairs to the spa area. I met my massage therapist, there were only male therapists available at the time I needed. He explained the massage and asked if there were any areas I didn't want to include in the full body treatment. He asked which oils did I want to use and I picked peppermint and eucalyptus, he did not, however, ask if I needed to use the restroom before my treatment or tell me where it was. So I went and found it across from my room before undressing, it was not very well kept for a \"spa\" bathroom. The room was too small for the treatment, I felt like my massage therapist was struggling to get around the table. What bothered me the most was the smell of old oil (Latinas--and other cultures whose families cook with a lot of oil knows what that smells like). I could barely smell the peppermint or the eucalyptus and the fragrance was missing completely by the end of my massage. The pressure, though he mentioned to tell me when it was too tense, was still too much and so that was my fault but also the reason I prefer female massage therapists in general. When I got up to get dressed, I went to grab the gratuity envelope and saw all the old oil splashes and wondered how long it had been since the room had been properly disinfected. I would not be going back because the biggest issue was that you could hear conversations, steps on the floor, movement, etc. from everything going on up above in the chiropractic space. That was distracting enough. I also waited way too long to check out with my Groupon voucher, it should've been prompt and friendly. She could've also asked if I wanted to schedule another appointment, but no one did. - 3/4/2016 This place is a joke and super unprofessional. She used her bare fingers to squeeze my pimples and I ended up with permanent acne scars on my face. Not only that a few days after my facial I broke out with even more pimples and my skin started peeling and burning. Worst facial ever! Additionally, I bought a signature facial which is supposed to include a neck head hand and shoulder massage, but instead they gave me the cheaper custom facial! After the service ended, I asked her what service I got, and she said custom facial. I told her that I had purchased the signature, and she claimed they're the same! I also asked front desk receptionist what the difference between the 2 is and she stumbled without an answer. I basically got ripped off and my face ripped off in the process. Never returning. Business owner information Estelle B. 3/7/2016 Hi Carol, Thank you for your feedback. I apologize you did not have a good experience at Balance Health Center. The last time you had your service was on Feb 6 for your facial service which includes neck, head and shoulder massages. If you feel uncomfortable or curious throughout the whole process, we encourage the patient to ask questions during the service. Every esthetician have different techniques of extraction and also wear gloves. We recommend you to give us a call about your concerns the day after of your service so that we can find a solution to fix it. Our staff is very professional and we take sanitization very seriously with any precaution with the services that we offer. As for the front desk receptionist she's new and still in training. I hope you give us the chance to service you in the future. Once again, Thank you for your feedback. - 6/5/2018 Cee cee is truly gifted. One if the best messages I've had in my life. Exemplary. What a pleasure to have found her. My body was a wreck and she definitely made me leave in a much better place. I like Balance a lot. Clean and really pleasant staff. They do always have deals going which is great but it shouldn't be the only reason to go here. I've had a number of masseuse and have never been disappointed. Ever. - 11/21/2019 Dr. Bernabei is wonderful. Very friendly, knowledgeable, and thorough. The whole staff is very kind and welcoming. The building has tons of character and feels warm and communal. I hope to try a massage here soon. Be sure to check their website for monthly spa specials! - 4/27/2019 This is the third time I've ever been to Balance for a massage and it's great each time. Got an incredible massage from Jamelia today! She listened to my problem areas, and didn't forget about the rest. Can't wait to go back and get another from her! - 3/16/2018 Never have I ever...Had a worse massage. To begin, I sat on a hard plank in the waiting area for 25 minutes prior to my massage. Granted, I was early for my appointment. My masseur, (although a pleasant bloke) saw me and introduced himself on his way out for his break. I think offering to at least let me hang up my coat would have been nice. Oh well... My \"full two hour massage,\" first 15 minutes was having a conversation that I wasn't interested in having and my 1hr and 45 minute massage felt more like pinching, scratching, poking and prodding. I have more oil in my hair than I did on my body. The head rest pillow was either too worn or didn't fit properly leaving my face to rest on metal. Two terry cloth towels were then provided to try to relieve the discomfort. The towels (bar rags) were rough and felt like sandpaper on my face. The establishment is cold. My feet during the entire massage felt like they were immersed in ice and pouring cold oil on my body direct from the container is not at all pleasurable or relaxing. Listening to the receptionist laughing from the floor above was more than annoying. When the receptionist asked me how my massage was, I told her \"the worst I have ever had.\" She said, \"oh so sorry,\" and swiped my credit card. The place is dirty! The floors and the bathroom pretty gross and the bar/reception desk looked like it had a frothy spittle trail of drool my dog used to leave behind after a long run, that my receipt was placed on top of to sign. So nasty. Here is the best of the news. Thankfully, it was a Groupon rate of 131.00 rather than...Wait for it...Wait for it...$280.00 that they would normally charge. Yes, you read that correctly. I did feel compelled to call them when I got home and prior to this review, to discuss what you are reading here. I feel it is important for an establishment to get a heads up and give them a chance to make good on a situation. However, after trying 3 times and nobody answering, I decided that adding poor customer service to the list wouldn't really make them or break them at this point. A massage at this place is right up there with having a cigar extinguished in your eye. Seriously, if you want to relax your mind and body save your money and fill up your bath tub. Add some bath salts, light a candle, put on some music of YOUR choice and enjoy. Business owner information Estelle B. 3/21/2018 Dear Rusty Sorry but according to our records there is no Rusty B. On file or has ever booked with us. You might of confused us with another establishment. Have a wonderful day. Thank you.
