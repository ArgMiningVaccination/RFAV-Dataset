Need of the hour is astute use of Traditional and Modern medicine.", "sitename": "Times of India Blog", "date": "2021-09-02", "cleaned_text": "modern medicine A few days back there was a news item about liver damage in people due to consumption of a medicinal plant, Giloy. So many people are consuming it now a days to ward of Covid or to cure it. It might be an effective remedy in such situations but the problem is that nobody knows how much of it is to be consumed, in what form and how often. The myriad Gurus available on social media will vouch for its efficacy just probably because it is mentioned in some of our ancient texts. Now, we have two groups of people. One is vehemently anti-traditional and pro-western. Another adores traditional and abhors anything modern. The first group says Ayurveda & other traditional forms of medicines are all mumbo-jumbo and should not be considered at all. The other group says only Ayurveda works. Ayurveda or the modern medicine, are both systems of medicine which are understood by specialists called Vaidyas and Doctors for the respective branches. Moreover, there is a prevalent belief that Ayurvedic medicines have no side effects. Nothing could be farther from truth. Any medicine is made of chemicals, which react with our body processes in a particular way and are supposed to elicit a specific response. There can be and usually are some side-effects of all the medicines. More so, if the medicine is administered in an uncontrolled manner. Question is if these are tolerable or not? A doctor is the best person to decide if the benefits of the medicine far outweigh its side effects. It is a pure cost benefit analysis. If you visit say a modern medicine doctor with the complaint of a fever, the doctor evaluates the cause first and then prescribes a medicine. If the cause is infection, he prescribes antibiotics (that too depends on the type infection). If the cause is something else, he will prescribe the medicine accordingly. Even the dose would vary from one individual to another depending on his age, weight, allergies and myriad other factors. Now, your friend with a similar complaint of fever, if he consumes the same medicines without getting an evaluation done by a doctor is sure to land himself into serious trouble. Similarly, the Ayurvedic medicines are prescribed by Ayurvedic doctors after evaluating the person and understanding his physiology. People who simply copy the treatment would end up in soup particularly when they start to consume extra quantity of the medicine considering it to be some kind of elixir which can only help and do no harm. In Ramayana, Laxman is administered Sanjivini Buti to revive him while he is unconscious owing to a hit by a special kind of weapon in the war. Today we have no clue about this medicine but (as per news reports) an Ayurvedic products manufacturer is trying to look for it in the Himalayas. Let us assume that they are able to find it. Then what? Do we administer it to every person who fells unconscious or is on the verge of dying? Do we convert it into pills to be popped in every morning to ward off death or illness? That is simply insane. Laxman was administered Sanjivini on the advice of much revered Vaidya, Sushain. Sushain Vaidya evaluated Laxman (he had to be smuggled out of enemy territory) and then prescribed the medicine. He did not tell the people who had gone to fetch him to simply go for Sanjivini although they had explained the weapon & Laxman's condition to him. He physically checked Laxman and then advocated the medicine. So, Sanjivini was able to revive Laxman as it was a suitable remedy for his condition. It might be fatal in another similar looking condition. As Indians, most of us have Tulsi (Holy Basil) in our homes. Besides the religious significance, Tulsi is known to be of immense medicinal value. Few leaves boiled in milk or tea help in mild fever. We put a few Tulsi leaves in Charnamrit (holy water) too. But the key is, a few leaves. If someone decides that Tulsi is very good and starts making chatni (paste) out of it and consuming it, he might well land in trouble. After all we have heard about Pudina (Mint) ki Chutney but never about Tulsi ki Chutney, right. There is a reason for that. Also, some companies subtly propagate the myth that their products being Ayurvedic can do no harm. It helps in generating revenues but harms Ayurveda. Currently, we have a fad for exotic plant called Kale. It is not indigenous to India, yet we (who can afford) are actively consuming it. Now it has been reported that this wonder plant has caused organ damage in some people as it tends to accumulate heavy metals like Thallium, Cesium etc. Kale is not bad but the key again is consumption in moderation. Also, it has been proven that the local floral & fauna are more suitable for consumption as our body has developed as per the environment. Thankfully, the trend is gradually shifting towards use of local produce for this reason and also to minimize carbon footprint. As far as Ayurvedic treatment is concerned, the trouble is that our ancient system of medicine got lost in the way of our development. We have been under rule of invaders for so long that our conventional knowledge suffered. Even after independence we embraced, mostly the western culture due to colonial hangover or some kind of inferiority complex or whatever reason. We neglected our traditional knowledge in all fields including medicine. The learned people of this art, the Vaidyas simply perished over time. We hardly see Pansari (shops selling traditional herbs) shops now a days; which used to be a regular feature in any market till around 30 years back. No interest was shown by the successive Governments too in developing Ayurveda, or in research in this arena. The current dispensation though has shown inclination in this direction. A little research that has happened is by the manufacturers of Ayurvedic products. Ideally, research should be by independent bodies and should be actively encouraged. We have ancient texts with us but those are so old and in a language for which we do not have proper experts. Unless we experiment, establish what is known, build on it by further research, we cannot redeem Ayurveda. Moreover, man and herbs have evolved over hundreds of years so the effects of the modern day herbs on modern man might be different from those mentioned in ancient texts. At the same time we must remember that modern medicine has immense value; it has increased our investigative skills manifold. We can actually see inside the body without cutting it. So, need of the hour is to marry these streams and to take the best from each. "}
