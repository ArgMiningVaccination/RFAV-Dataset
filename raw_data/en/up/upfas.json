Some of the scientists in this new study published an [earlier article](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa021134?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2002, based on data from 537,303 Danish children born between 1991 and 1998. For scientist, healthcare professionals and public health experts, this issue has long been settled, with over 15 robust studies done over many years across 3 continents involving millions of children discounting the findings of a small study published 21 years ago and considered [the most horrid paper](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/18/how-disgraced-anti-vaxxer-andrew-wakefield-was-embraced-by-trumps-america) in modern medical history. The researchers from Statens Serum Institut in Denmark looked at 657,461 Danish children born between 1999 and 2010 and followed them from the time they reached one year old until 2013. Within the duration of the study with vaccination rates around 95%, 6,517 children developed autism, but the researchers found absolutely no difference in the risk of developing autism between children who had the MMR vaccine and those who had not. \"We see vaccine skepticism growing,\" says lead author Anders Hviid, an investigator at the Statens Serum Institut, the national public health organization in Denmark. \"So we thought it was a good idea to revisit the hypothesis and try to get scientific answers to the different criticisms from skeptics of the original study.\" There was absolutely no connection between vaccination and autism, neither in the general study population nor in the at-risk children. In other words, children vaccinated with MMR did not develop autism at a significantly different rate than those who were not vaccinated. In addition, the timing of autism diagnoses did not cluster after the kids received MMR vaccination. \"The myth that vaccines cause autism needs to go away. It's been debunked time and time again and it's putting the health of children (and to a lesser extent, also adults) at risk. This idea that vaccines cause autism is still around and is still getting a lot of exposure in social media,\" noted Anders Hviid. Measles outbreaks have been reported in a number of countries around the world. Globally, measles cases increased by 48.4% between 2017 and 2018, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO's European regional office reported there were more than 85,000 cases across the continent in 2018 and 72 measles deaths. The WHO has declared vaccine hesitancy as one of the [top 10 threats "}
