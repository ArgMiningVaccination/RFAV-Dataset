ND degree programs must meet the standards established by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME), a governing body recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. Learn more about the CNME's program standards. As the U.S. healthcare system evolves, there's more need than ever for qualified doctors who can serve the diverse needs of our patient populations. Licensed naturopathic doctors (NDs) are trained to diagnose and treat illness. Like MDs, NDs are primary care physiciansa patient's first stop for medical care. Unlike MDs, NDs take a whole-person approach to wellness: They listen to and collaborate with their patients to choose the best approach to care. NDs are in demand as primary care doctors, research scientists, specialists in hospital settings, and more. Student Experience Growing up in the Din\u00e9 (Navajo) Nation, LaKota Scott saw a real need for medicine that blended traditional wisdom, modern science and collaborative patient care. For her, naturopathic medicine offered the best of all worlds. A recipient of a Scholars for a Healthy Oregon - Naturopathic Physicians Opportunities (SHONPO) scholarship, LaKota aspired to practice medicine within indigenous communities after graduation. In her final years at NUNM, LaKota preceptored with Zaagi'idiwin, a doula training and maternal health organization working with midwives in the Din\u00e9 (Navajo) Nation. \"I realized that they [Native peoples] needed someone who understood not only their language but also their cultural values and belief systems\u2014that was missing in the care they received from non-Native medical providers. Naturopathic medicine resonated with the way I grew up and the way I understood healing culturally.\" -LaKota Scott, ND (' 20) After graduating from NUNM, LaKota earned a Master of Public Health at the University of North Dakota. She now practices naturopathic medicine at Blossom Clinic in Portland, Oregon.

This rigorous online curriculum matches the intensity of our on-campus program, while increasing access to our students who cannot or choose not to attend their first year in-person. To date, there are no accredited naturopathic schools that allow students to complete their entire four-year degree solely through distance learning. NUNM's first-year online program bridges that gap by allowing the first three terms of our nationally recognized and accredited ND program to be completed remotely. If you have been wondering how to jump-start your career in natural medicine, our online ND program for first-year students is the perfect solution. Learn under the broadest scope of practice in North America Our campus in Portland, Oregon, gives students the unique opportunity to experience the forefront of natural medicine education in the epicenter of the modern U.S. natural medicine movement. In Oregon, naturopathic medicine is widely practiced and naturopathic doctors are welcomed at all levels of the healthcare system. Our students have access to mentors at integrative clinics, in large hospital systems, and educational partnerships with conventional medical schools like Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). Oregon has the broadest scope of naturopathic licensure in the U.S. This means that our students get more hands-on experience with more medical skills and modalities than any other naturopathic school. Oregon licensure empowers naturopathic doctors to fully participate in their patients' care, from preventive pediatrics to prescribing pharmaceuticals, to performing ultrasounds. Learn more about Oregon's scope of practice and why it matters for medical education. Customize your own career path NUNM students can pursue areas of focus within the field of natural medicine.

In their final year, students can take a 20-hour course to prepare them for the NPLEX licensing exam and, in 2017, our graduates scored an average of 96% on the NPLEX II. Our graduates are uniquely qualified to serve in a wide variety of healthcare careers and positions, from primary care doctors in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), to complementary providers in leading oncology hospitals. *This data was created using a snapshot of employment outcomes collected 15 months after graduation.
