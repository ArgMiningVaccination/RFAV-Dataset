Naturopathy and Aromatherapy used in a holistic way, through a consultation with [Steve](/about-me), will allow you to discover ways to stimulate and provide balance for the body to regain its state of health or equilibrium. Illnesses and discomforts such as high blood pressure, ezcema, digestive irregularities, musculo-skeletal problems, hormonal issues, emotional distress and respiratory disorders, nervous, endocrine, reproductive and immune system (conditions such as insomnia, MS, ME, Parkinsons and colitis) can all be treated through use of essential oils. Recommendations will be filtered according to your age, personality, physiological and emotional biotype, lifestyle and seasonal environment. Eating habits, sleep pattern, medical history and current health concerns, skin and muscular condition, toxin intake, detoxification processes, exercise, stress levels, emotional, financial, time and physical restraints can all effect the best choice of natural oils. The consultation looks at your personal facts, which can be supplied by an email prior to meeting if you prefer to save time here. Choose between a 30 minute or 1 hour consultation depending on the complexity of your condition. After a consultation, [Steve](/about-me) will advise the best balance of oils (normally between 2-10 different essential oils), your method of ingestion, in the best quantity, strength, and frequency. Essential oils' goodness can be taken in many different ways such as in natural food or drink (eg cooking oils), in capsules, through intake of air (eg vaporised through diffusers, oil burners, candles, baths and showers), and via the skin by massage oils, creams, scrubs, or washes.
