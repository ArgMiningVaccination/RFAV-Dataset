Get Quiet: Protect the energetic container of your space by shutting the door or lighting a candle. Get Grounded: You can sit for meditation on the floor on your OKO mat resting your hands on your knees or your thighs. For some life you can also fold your mat or use a pillow, cushion, or folded blanket. If you're seated in a chair, uncross your legs and rest the soles of your feet on the floor. Release Expectations: There is no right or wrong way to meditate. Close your eyes and pay attention to your breathing. Thoughts will come and go as they please. Repeat Over Time: Remember that meditation is a practice. Commit to sitting every morning or every for five to ten minutes with your eyes closed. Incorporate other modalities into your practice such as journaling or listening to spiritual music.
