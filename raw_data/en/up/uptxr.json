The morning after my first shot, I was shocked to see a huge powerful light in my immune system. It did not look at all like my usual immune system, which I know is healthy. This was very powerful - and my sense was that it was teaching my body, my immune system, to be extremely strong, to take no prisoners, to totally \"kick butt!\" I was laughing and remembering a very short ridiculous movie I saw years ago called \"Bambi Meets Godzilla.\" If you watch this, be sure to check out all the credits, all the way to the end. My usual healthy immune system is Bambi. The new information from the vaccine - you guessed it - Godzilla. For a fun laugh, here's the youtube link: [https://youtu.be/5R-rbzcEM8A](https://lightenyourway.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fba588f3e98e490f6e26b2bfc&id=fc38d3baff&e=ec7afd746e) I have not had a vaccine in over 30 years. Maybe a tetanus shot 30 - 40 years ago, but it's been awhile. My initial thought about getting a Covid vaccine was to wait and see... I have a healthy immune system, I am wearing a mask and limiting grocery shopping, and I trust my body to stay healthy. But then I spent some time learning about the mRNA Covid vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer). When I learned that the vaccines do not contain heavy metals, do not contain any dead or alive virus in them, and do not interfere with your DNA, I was more open. What these mRNA vaccines do is \"they teach our cells how to make a protein\u2014or even just a piece of a protein\u2014that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. That immune response, which produces antibodies, is what protects us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies.\" (per the CDC website) When I intuitively tuned in to the vaccines, I was shocked by the huge light I \"saw\" - like the vaccines carried light and energy from a spiritual realm. They felt like a gift from Spirit to help our planet heal, to help us move through this dark and challenging time. So, I was ready and wanting to be vaccinated. I'm over 65 years old, and after alot of time online searching for appointments, Jim and I got our first shots (Moderna) at our local CVS the day before Valentine's Day. It was painless, quick, and totally easy, with a minimal reaction the following day I have worked with several clients who have experienced some lingering reactions from the vaccine. In one case, we helped the client's immune system make friends with the vaccine. We got them to hold hands, intertwine their fingers, to work together. When we get vaccinated, we can bless the vaccine, and welcome it - know it is hear to help us! So, I am very very grateful to be fully vaccinated, to have a strong healthy body, to be more FREE, and from my perspective, to help our country and our planet get past this dark time - to be part of the solution. \"Trust life, and it will teach you, in joy and sorrow, all you need to know.\" - James Baldwin "}
