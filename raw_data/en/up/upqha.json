Sessions on Malignant Hematology Are We Personalizing MDS Therapy in 2023? of myeloid malignancies hallmarked by dysplasia of the bone marrow, peripheral blood cytopenias and propensity for transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). There have been transformative changes in the diagnostic and molecular classification of patients with MDS as well as more personalized prognostic discrimination based on the underlying molecular landscape. Importantly, there has been significant insight into the underlying pathobiology of these patients which has identified additional therapeutic targets. There have been new approvals and positive phase 3 studies for patients with lower risk MDS but we have continued to not have a change in the standard of care for higher risk MDS patients. Dr. Rena Xian will discuss updates in classification including recent WHO and ICC classifications as well as how molecular annotation of patients can refine prognosis with the molecular IPSS (IPSS-M). Dr. Marie Sebert will discuss the current treatment algorithm of patients with lower risk MDS as well as will highlight novel therapies under investigation to both ameliorate cytopenias and/or provide disease modification in patients with lower risk MDS. Dr. David Sallman will discuss the historical lessons we have learned from past failed randomized studies in higher risk MDS and cover the current ongoing randomized efforts to improve upon the standard of care of azacitidine for higher risk MDS patients.

[back to top](#) CAR T Cells in ALL: Bridge or Definitive Therapy? Most pediatric patients with ALL achieve durable long-term remission with chemotherapy alone, however, some experience refractory or multiply relapsed diseases requiring further definitive therapy. HSCT has a long-established track record in ALL with favorable overall survival rates. More recently, CAR T-cells have been a transformational addition to the tools available for the treatment of ALL. While there are generally accepted criteria for selecting patients for definitive therapy, currently, physician judgement and institutional preference primarily drive the decision on HSCT vs CAR T. This educational session will explore the criteria to be considered for using HSCT vs CAR T in high-risk ALL including patient's individual risk, prior complications/toxicities/organ functions, graft sources available, institutional expertise, and access to cellular therapy. Dr. Nirali Shah will discuss delayed toxicities following CAR T-cells, outline the management of delayed toxicity in the post-CAR T-cell setting, weigh current approaches to vaccination and monitoring of immune reconstitution post CAR T-cells and shed light on active efforts in the study of late effects, including monitoring of second malignant neoplasms. Dr. Alice Bertaina will discuss HSCT considerations for ALL. The recent emergence of CD19+ CAR T therapy as another viable treatment option for R/R ALL offers unique considerations for the selection of definitive therapy in these patients. This talk will outline the current state of the art of HSCT for ALL and will discuss relevant considerations for selecting a definitive therapy in ALL. Dr. Stephen Gottschalk will review the role of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT) to sustain remission post CD19-CAR T cell therapies and discuss 2nd genetic modifications to improve CAR T cell persistence and prevent the emergence of antigen loss variants.

Prevention remains the cornerstone of graft versus host disease (GVHD) management. The landscape of GVHD prevention is undergoing significant changes, with modifications to the standard calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate regimens, along with incorporation of novel agents, and development of innovative graft manipulation techniques. These advancements have expanded donor pool, including the use of haploidentical and mismatched unrelated donors. However, despite these improvements, GVHD continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality after transplantation. Biomarker algorithms show promise in developing preemptive approaches to reduce GVHD and improve GVHD treatment outcomes. In this review Dr. Schultz will summarize the state-of-the-art risk assignments and algorithms for acute and chronic GVHD and discuss current approaches and limitations for preemptive therapy. Dr. Qayed will review recent clinical trials and approaches to acute GVHD prophylaxis, including in unrelated and haploidentical donor transplantation, and discuss changes in clinical practice as well as emerging strategies and ongoing clinical trials. Dr. Amanam will review clinical trial results regarding chronic GVHD outcomes, promising targeted agents for chronic GVHD treatment, and the use of novel endpoints to assess the effectiveness of GVHD-directed therapies.

The complexity of treating hematologic malignancies continues to grow rapidly with novel agents, BiTe therapy, CAR-T, and transplantation, which offer potentially a new horizon for patients struggling with these diseases. As these therapies are becoming the stand of care, the question of access remains a large factor in improving patient outcomes in the community where most of the cancer care is delivered. This educational session will explore the diagnostic, supportive, and treatment challenges that often present in the local setting with acute leukemia, high grade lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. We offer a case-based discussion for optimal management, as well as explore the role of clinical trials locally in terms of increasing access, diversity, options, and outcomes in the community.

CAR T-Cells and Bispecific Antibodies How Do We Apply T-Cell Redirection Therapy for Multiple Myeloma? CAR T-Cells and Bispecific Antibodies The introduction of immune based therapeutics such as bispecific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor engineered T cells (CAR T) has revolutionized the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. Such therapies targeting plasma cell antigens such as the B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), G-protein coupled receptor family C group 5 member D (GPRC5D) and Fc Receptor Like 5 (FCRL5) lead to deep and durable responses in triple class and penta-refractory myeloma patients. These therapies also introduced a new set of challenges related to their unique toxicities and their management as well as the understanding of the optimal way to administer and sequence them. Dr. Nizar J.Bahlis will discuss the current use of bispecific antibodies to treat multiple myeloma. In addition the mechanisms that mediate the acquired resistance or escape to bispecific antibodies will be outlined while providing a guidance to the optimal administration and sequencing of these drugs. Dr. Sham Mailankody will review the currently approved CAR T cells in multiple myeloma as well as other CAR T cell platforms currently under clinical investigations. He will also discuss the optimal usage and sequencing of CAR T cells in the context of other multiple myeloma therapies. Dr. Surbhi Sidana, will review the toxicities associated with bispecific antibodies and CAR T cells, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), delayed neurotoxicity, cytopenias, and infection. She will also provide guidance on how to manage these toxicities.

CD19 directed CAR-T cell therapy represents a breakthrough in cancer treatment achieving unprecedented success in relapsed/refractory B cell lymphomas. However, the economic burden related to manufacturing and logistics, adverse events such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity, infections and cytopenias underscores the importance of assessing prognostic and predictive tools for therapy success. Outcome of patients who progress after CAR-T cell therapy is poor in the current era and management remains unclear. BITE's are recently approved off-the-shelf T cell engagers that have shown excellent efficacy and tolerability leading to regulatory approval in relapsed lymphomas. Thus, the ideal sequencing of T cell therapies in relapsed aggressive lymphomas necessitates a roadmap to further guide the contemporaneous management of lymphomas. Chair: Manali K.

Rare hematologic malignancies are neoplastic diseases that hematologists encounter only occasionally. These diseases are often diagnosed late after symptoms persist or standard treatments fail, require multidisciplinary care, individualized treatment plans, strong supportive care, as well as access to experimental therapies. This educational session will review and discuss three rare hematologic malignancies: Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH), Systemic Mastocytosis (SM), and Abla will cover LCH, a rare inflammatory myeloid neoplasm with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations in children and adults. High-risk patients include those with liver, spleen, bone marrow involvement, refractory/relapsed disease, and those with CNS neurodegeneration. Patients without high-risk disease have excellent survival but are prone to late sequelae. This talk will focus on recent molecular discoveries, management of high-risk patients, MAPK targeted therapies, new and emerging treatment approaches, and unanswered questions in LCH. Dr. Radia will review SM. Over 95% of patients harbor the driver KIT D816V mutation resulting in mast cell accumulation and proliferation leading to variable symptoms due to mast cell mediator release and end-organ damage with advanced disease. Accurate diagnostic and clinical classification is vital to appropriately treat and personalize therapy. Dr. Radia will evaluate diagnostic criteria, clinical classification, risk stratification, and therapeutic options available for patients with non-advanced and advanced SM including multikinase KIT inhibitors. Amyloidosis encompasses diseases characterized by abnormal protein accumulation in organs, leading to heterogeneous and diverse clinical manifestations. Delayed diagnosis is common in amyloidosis, with patients experiencing symptoms for several months to years and consulting multiple specialists before amyloidosis is considered and confirmed. Dr. D'Souza's session will identify concerning symptoms and signs that should trigger a suspicion of amyloidosis, describe a systems approach to the diagnosis, and outline key steps after a diagnosis of amyloidosis is made.

CLL is the most common form of leukemia in the western world. As the majority of patients are elderly at diagnosis and often have other medical comorbidities, this creates a challenging situation for treating oncologists. Important considerations include effective and tolerable regimens, that utilize novel mechanisms of action and can be tailored to the patient, particularly those with high-risk features. This educational session will focus on dual targeted therapeutic options for treatment na\u00efve patients and novel agents under investigation in Richter Transformation. In addition, this session with discuss the role of minimal residual disease in the management of CLL. Dr. Chaitra S. Ujjani will discuss clinical trials leading to the approval of dual targeted regimens for the front-line treatment of CLL. She will also discuss clinical trials involving the combination of BTK and BCL2 inhibitors in previously untreated patients. Dr. Joanna M. Rhodes will discuss the role of minimal residual disease (MRD) testing in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A focus will be placed on data from clinical trials of targeted therapies and the role of MRD in response assessments, and its clinical utility in practice. Dr Toby A Eyre will discuss the current management and challenges of managing patients with Richter Transformation of CLL. Recent advances, clinical trial data and future developments will be discussed.

[back to top](#) How Do We Improve Outcomes in Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma in 2023? Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clinically and biologically highly heterogeneous disease, as the overall survival can vary from more than a decade in patients with standard risk disease treated with intensive chemotherapy to 2-3 years in patients with high-risk features. Current standard of care includes the use of antiCD38 monoclonal antibodies upfront, both in patients eligible for transplant and in transplant non eligible patients, in combination with immunomodulatory agents and/or proteasome inhibitors. Recently, anti BCMA therapies have also been introduced with impressive efficacy results in late lines of treatment, and studies are evaluating their role in earlier phases. This educational session will explore the evidence for best practices for patients with relapsed/refractory MM including a focus on treatment of functional high risk patients, relapse after anti CD38 therapies and relapse after anti-BCMA treatment. Dr. Francesca Gay will discuss the treatment approach for \"functional high-risk patients\", typically defined as patients who do not necessarily display baseline high-risk features but show a suboptimal response to induction therapy or relapse early after treatment initiation. She will first review the current available known risk factors to promptly identify these patients, and then focus on the possible management. Dr. Monique Hartley-Brown will focus on the management of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma post anti-CD38 therapy exposure. She will discuss data for using BCMA targeted therapy options and non-BCMA targeted therapies in 1st and 2nd relapse disease, including cellular therapies in these earlier relapse disease setting. Dr. Adam Cohen will discuss potential options for the patient progressing after a BCMA-targeted therapy, including switching to a different BCMA-targeted therapy, trying a non-BCMA-targeted, T cell- directed therapy, re-exploring a standard myeloma triplet/quadruplet regimen, or trying a novel non-T cell-directed therapy. Finally, he will review patient- and disease-related factors that may help guide decision-making.

While the vast majority of chronic phase CML patients achieve optimal responses with BCR::ABL1-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), there remains a select group of patients who either experience resistance and/or disease progression despite TKI therapy. Strategies for improving outcomes in this challenging cohort need to be formulated and advances in technology, understanding of disease biology and therapeutics can further ongoing innovation in this area. This educational session will explore the recent developments in blast phase CML, including a focus on updates in therapeutics directed against this phase of disease. Addressing the mechanisms underpinning resistance, including kinase domain mutations, will also be reviewed. Lastly, we will discuss atypical CML, an orphan disease, which although shares a similar name has a completely different disease biology, treatment and management approach. Dr Naranie Shanmuganathan will outline the key updates in disease definitions within recent guidelines affecting how clinicians classify the phases of CML, attempting to identify which patients have the highest transformation potential. Identification of a CML-like acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) phenotype may assist in differentiating Ph+ ALL from de novo lymphoid blast crisis CML which remains a challenge. Furthermore, technological advances with next generation sequencing have also aided in unmasking the complexity of the genomic landscape associated with disease progression which may offer future therapeutic targets. Lastly, novel strategies to treat blast phase CML will be explored and can offer an alternative approach to conventional treatment. Associate Professor Simona Soverini will follow on with a discussion regarding the impact of kinase domain mutations in CML which still continues to be the best understood mechanism of resistance in CML. An unsatisfactory response to TKI therapy may indicate the presence of mutations in the BCR::ABL1 kinase domain. Associate Professor Soverini will explore the optimal timing for BCR::ABL1 kinase domain mutation testing with a detailed review of the available and developing technologies. She will also illustrate how the presence of a TKI-resistant mutation should trigger a change of therapy, and detection of specific mutations can help direct sequential TKI therapy to maximise response and minimize expansion of a resistant clone. Finally, Associate Professor Massimo Breccia will explore updates to the diagnostic criteria based on the recent iteration of the WHO and the ICC. Next generation sequencing has also started to expose the genomic landscape associated with atypical CML, with a particular focus on SETBP1 and ETNK1 variants. While a consensus on prognostic stratification is yet to be agreed upon, the various factors that have been associated with prognostication will be discussed, including the Mayo clinic model. A summary of possible treatments will also be reviewed including the appropriateness of an allogeneic stem cell transplant even after the identification of actionable targets.

The addition of novel therapeutic agents has changed the standard of care for advanced-stage and relapsed/refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Limited-stage disease has traditionally been treated with combination chemotherapy with or without consolidative radiation. Novel therapeutics are actively being integrated into frontline therapy for limited-stage disease to improve acute survival rates and optimize longer-term outcomes. Historically, survival rates have been modest for older cHL patients. However, a renewed effort globally has resulted in the generation of a multitude of new real-world and clinical trial data. In addition, there remains an unmet need to identify therapeutic options for cHL patients who have progressed after brentuximab vedotin and PD-1 blockade. Dr. Sairah Ahmed will discuss the treatment of limited-stage cHL with standard frontline chemotherapy or combined modality therapy. As CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin and PD-1 blockade have transformed the treatment of relapsed/refractory cHL, recent studies incorporating these agents in limited-stage disease will be explored. Dr. Andy Evens will examine current real-world and clinical trial data for older cHL patients, emphasizing prognostication, geriatric assessments, treatment intensity, anthracycline use, integration of targeted therapeutic agents, and post-acute survivorship. Patient management and evidence-based data for therapeutic decision-making will be evaluated. Dr. Natalie Grover will discuss the treatment of relapsed/refractory cHL in patients whose disease has progressed after brentuximab vedotin and PD-1 blockade. Using a case-based approach, therapeutic options for these challenging cases will be presented, including the role of cytotoxic chemotherapy, allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and clinical trial results with novel agents, including chimeric antigen receptor T-cells.

Adolescents and young adult patients (AYA) represent a unique population of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). AYA patients do not fit squarely into either pediatric or adult cohorts. Unfortunately, AYA patients have been shown to have differential outcomes than older and younger patients with ALL. This educational session will explore describe approaches to therapy, differences between AYA and pediatric patients with ALL, and options for improving outcomes for this patient population. Dr. John Molina will review the current outcomes from AYA patients with B-ALL treated with commonly used pediatric or \"pediatric-inspired\" regimens in the upfront setting. He will discuss the ongoing clinical trials incorporating immunotherapies into the existing chemotherapy backbones and any available preliminary results, as well as the shift to next generation sequencing (NGS) for measurable residual disease (MRD) assessment. Finally, with the introduction of novel therapies into the upfront setting and improved disease response evaluation, he will review the changing role of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) as consolidative therapy for AYA patients achieving a first, complete remission. Dr. Tamara P. Miller will then review the differences between AYA patients and pediatric patients in terms of survival, risks, and barriers to enrollment. She will describe contrasts in genetic risk factors and development of toxicities. She will discuss the range of treatment, trial enrollment and psychosocial challenges that are differ between AYA and pediatric patients. Finally, Dr. Emily Curran will review novel strategies to improve outcomes for AYAs. She will discuss ongoing work to overcome the adverse disease biology that is more common among AYAs with ALL. She will describe ways to leverage technology to improve adherence and try to address psychosocial challenges. Finally, she will review differences in healthcare delivery for AYAs with ALL and need for increased enrollment in clinical trials. Chair: Tamara P.

Over the last several years there have been many advances made in the area of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). In this session, we will review the management of MPNs across the spectrum. In polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET), management of cytoreductive therapies, and appropriate choice of patient and agent will be reviewed. In myelofibrosis, there has been an explosion of new treatments. These new agents attempt to address some of the unmet needs in MF therapy, including thrombocytopenia, anemia, and disease modification. Newer JAK inhibitors are designed to allow for maximal JAK inhibition even in patients with thrombocytopenia and anemia. Newer agents are targeting non-canonical pathways that may impact disease biology. Finally, there have been advances in the understanding of allogeneic stem cells for myelofibrosis, which will be reviewed, including challenges pre-, peri- and post-transplant management.

While the number of novel and effective therapies available for patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has increased significantly over the past 5 years, management of relapsed and refractory AML, particularly following induction with a venetoclax based regimen, remains a challenge. Moreover, the ability to measure the level of disease at the morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular level has increased the complexity of disease assessments. Specifically, questions remain as to what should be measured when, how it should be measured, and whether this information should be used in risk stratification or when making treatment decisions. This session will explore the different technologies that are utilized for detection of measurable disease and make recommendations for how to incorporate these results into your clinical practice. This session will also address the challenge of treatment recommendations for patients who fail hypomethylating agents + venetoclax and discuss novel therapies in development, including those that are immunotherapy based.

Putting the Puzzle Pieces Together Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a curative intervention for both malignant and non-malignant hematological disorders. Despite its potential, HCT is accompanied by considerable challenges in patient care, particularly related to treatment-associated morbidity and mortality. In considering the transplant candidate, transplant teams rely on a comprehensive assessment of HCT candidates across three key dimensions encompassing patient, disease, and transplantation-related factors. This detailed evaluation allows clinicians to balance the benefits and risks of HCT and to personalize the parameters of HCT to the individual patient. This educational session centers on the tools and evidence for evaluating the physiological resilience of HCT candidates. We will delve into the available evidence and literature surrounding the assessment of geriatric, frailty, and comorbidity factors that have vital roles in the overall evaluation process. Moreover, the session will emphasize the practical implementation of these evaluations in clinical decision-making processes and how they can guide both patient discussions and decision-making for transplantation recipients. Overall, our aim is to equip clinicians with a comprehensive understanding of candidate evaluation while indicating areas needing further research. We hope to enhance patient outcomes in HCT and foster advancements in the field.

These may be life-threatening conditions or those that could become life-threatening if not managed quickly and capably. One of the challenges is the need to start treatments while diagnostic tests are in process, and often there is diagnostic uncertainty for a while. Sometimes these conditions require urgent transfer to tertiary care centers. Evidence-based interventions and consensus guidelines are not available for many inpatient hematology emergency conditions. In this session, expert opinions are presented for Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL), Acute Life-Threatening is inpatient hematology emergency in which patients present with life-threatening risk of intracranial hemorrhage. A hitherto highly fatal disease, APL has transformed into the most curable acute myeloid leukemia in adults since the introduction of differentiating agents, all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide. Still, early mortality constitutes a significant proportion of deaths attributed to APL, with hemorrhage being the most common cause. In this presentation, Dr. Martin Tallman discusses strategies to prevent early mortality among newly diagnosed APL patients. Acute Life-Threatening Immune Thrombocytopenia (ALT ITP) is an inpatient hematology emergency in which patients present with either observed \"critical\" bleeding or the perception of high risk for life-threatening bleeding (e.g., platelet count <20). ALT ITP is a diagnosis dependent on circumstantial evidence, often including \"lack of response\" to platelet transfusions. Management of ALT ITP has mostly been based on expert opinions and individual providers' experiences because there have not been evidence-based or consensus approaches. In this presentation, Dr. Steven Fein elaborates, from a community hematologist's perspective, the challenges associated with identifying and treating adult patients who have ALT ITP. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an inpatient hematology emergency in which patients present with life-threatening systemic inflammation. In this presentation, Dr. Adi Zoref-Lorenz will outline the approach to the recognition and rapid assessment of HLH syndromes in critically ill inpatients. The importance of the newly described \"OHI index\" in hematologic malignancy-associated HLH will be highlighted. She will discuss the recognition and management of pertinent HLH triggers. The talk will provide practical guidance regarding immunosuppressive therapy and the emergence of novel targeted agents for HLH.

Patients with cirrhosis are at increased risk of both bleeding, predominantly due to portal hypertension and thrombosis, typically involving the portal vasculature. This education session reviews the laboratory assessment of hemostasis in patients with cirrhosis, management of peri-procedural bleeding risk. Finally, management of splanchnic vein thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis is discussed, including the approach in patients who present with gastrointestinal bleeding or with thrombocytopenia, and the role of direct oral anticoagulants. Prof Ton Lisman will present the current understanding of hemostasis in patients with advanced chronic liver disease. Currently available routine and research laboratory assays will be presented with regard to their role, interpretation and limitations in the evaluation of hemostasis in this patient group. Dr Lara Roberts will discuss how to evaluate the peri-procedural bleeding risk of patients with advanced chronic liver disease. The role and limitations of the available hemostatic therapies for prevention of procedural bleeding will be explored. Dr Roberts will present societal guidance recommendations for clinical practice and highlight priorities for future research. Prof Walter Ageno will initially focus on the association between advanced chronic liver disease, and splanchnic vein thrombosis. Prof Ageno will discuss the challenges in the initial management of splanchnic vein thrombosis in this patient group, with particular emphasis on patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding, or at high risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and/or esophageal varices. Finally, the talk will review the available evidence for risks and benefits of anticoagulation in this setting, including the role of the direct oral anticoagulants.

Several countries, including the US, have recently instituted individualized risk assessment policies to try to balance fairness to potential donors with the safety of the blood supply. Meeting the demand for blood products also requires balancing patient needs with the safety of volunteer blood donors. This session will review evolving policies for selecting blood donors as well as two potential hematologic consequences of frequent donation, clonal hematopoiesis and T-cell lymphopenia.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) can lead to debilitating morbidity and premature mortality. Over the past decade, 3 new drugs have been FDA-approved for treating children and adults with SCD, and many others are actively being studied. Similarly, novel curative approaches are increasingly becoming available. Unfortunately, a paucity of data exists regarding whether outcomes are improving in individuals with SCD. Dr. Ken Ataga will discuss disease-modifying therapies that are currently FDA-approved and some of the most promising drugs that are underway. Dr. Adetola Kassim will describe the most recent outcomes of haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation compared to more traditional approaches. He will also compare the pros and cons of various haploidentical platforms that are currently available. Dr. John Tisdale will discuss the encouraging results of gene therapy and gene editing trials for patients with SCD and the remaining challenges.

Clinical presentations vary depending on the underlying germline defect and patients may present variably and with only subtle findings suggestive of IBMFS. Fanconi anemia (FA) and telomere biology disorders (TBD) represent the commonest IBMFS; both have traditionally been considered disorders of early childhood but are increasingly being recognized in adolescents and adults, sometimes in the absence of BMF. In this session, first a practical overview will be given of clinical and laboratory features that can be used to recognize and diagnose the IBMFS in the hematology clinic. Next, both FA and TBD will be discussed in greater detail, outlining the presentation and management of these complex disorders with a focus on adolescents and adults. Dr. Emma Groarke will review the clinical and laboratory features that can be used to distinguish immune from inherited bone marrow failure. She will discuss the increasing spectrum of IBMFS being recognized in adolescents and adults, the merits and usage of specialized testing, and the role of germline genetic testing. Additionally, she will highlight why proper identification of IBMFS in the clinic is crucial for optimal patient management. Dr. Timothy Olson will address the unique challenges and evidence-based practice recommendations for the management of adolescents and young adults (AYA) with FA. Specifically, he will discuss the increased frequency of FA diagnosis in AYA patients, improved long-term survival of children with FA following matched sibling and alternative donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) performed for BMF, and the expanding need for long-term monitoring in patients achieving hematologic stabilization following ex vivo gene therapy. Dr. Marena Niewisch will focus on the specific characteristics of TBD in adults and the differences in both presentation and genetic background compared with childhood-onset disease. She will outline the clinical clues that should raise suspicion for an underlying TBD and prompt further diagnostic. Necessary surveillance measures will be outlined, and potential therapy options addressed. Chair: Emma M. Groarke, MD NIH Bethesda, MD Speakers: Emma M.

While categorizing venous thromboembolism (VTE) as \"provoked\" vs \"unprovoked\" is an important determinant of recurrence risk, it is not always straightforward to classify thrombotic events as some risk factors are minor and transient (i.e., \"minimally\" provoked) while others are persistent. Furthermore, multiple risk factors may be present. This has led some to recommend that the terms be abandoned. Dr. Cecilia Becattini will discuss the role of major, minor, and persistent risk factors in the development of VTE. Clinical assessment of the risk factors in an individual patient allows for an estimate of the recurrence risk and a decision as to the need for long-term anticoagulation. Hematologists are often referred patients with abnormal coagulation tests (elevated D-dimer or Factor VIII coagulant activity, low levels of protein C or protein S); they will also encounter abnormal results of tests (e.g., MTHFR, PAI-1 promoter polymorphisms) with which they may be unfamiliar that carry little if any thrombotic risk. Through a series of cases, Dr. Kenneth Bauer will discuss the ramifications of such testing (\"do's, don'ts, and nuances\") on management. Dr. Keith McCrae will review three clinical cases that raise perplexing questions about management of the antiphospholipid syndrome, including the significance of IgM antiphospholipid antibodies, whether to switch from a DOAC to warfarin, and considerations on how to treat an asymptomatic patient with antiphospholipid antibodies. Definitive data to inform management of such patients is often lacking, forcing the practitioner to rely upon expert opinion and patient preference in decision making.

Our speakers will discuss how in iron deficiency we need to change how we use laboratory tests to diagnose iron deficiency to insure we are correctly diagnosing ALL with iron deficiency and not just the select few with severe iron depletion. For therapy we need to recognized oral iron either fails or is not appropriate for many patients and that intravenous iron is safe and effective Dr. Deloughery will discuss what ferritin is and why it is used as a measure of body iron stores. Then he will demonstrate the high incidence of iron deficiency in women - up to 50% of healthy women with absent iron stores on bone marrow exam. Finally, he will advocate that ferritin cuts off need to be much higher to properly diagnose iron deficiency in all affected women and the implications of such a change. In this section on The Iron Revolution, Dr Auerbach will be highlighting the administration of the four available iron products permitting complete replacement dosing in a single setting. He will discuss methods of administration, safety, and indications. Most importantly he will dispel notions of danger created by antiquated folklore and show a video of a minor infusion reaction, how to manage it, and how the inappropriate intervention for the minor reaction can lead to a hemodynamically significant serious adverse event ostensibly and inappropriately ascribed to the IV iron. Dr Powers will discuss that iron deficiency anemia occurs most commonly in young children due to low iron diet and adolescent girls due to menstrual blood loss. However, children with gastrointestinal conditions such as intestinal failure, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and/or other chronic conditions including chronic kidney disease and heart failure, also commonly have iron deficiency. In children who have an incomplete response to oral iron, intravenous iron therapy is increasingly being utilized with benefits such as rapid repletion of iron stores, in addition to resolution of anemia, less gastrointestinal side effects, and relief for patients and families struggling with long-term iron supplementation. Four intravenous iron formulations have approved indications in pediatrics and many are increasingly utilized off-label in children as well. Here we discuss the indications and appropriate timing of intravenous iron therapy in children with a wide range of underlying etiologies.

[back to top](#) Transfusion Support in Sickle Cell Disease In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), transfusion, by modifying the hemoglobin (Hb)A/HbS red blood cell (RBC) ratio, remains a major treatment to prevent or treat acute vaso-occlusive or chronic complications. Dr. Anoosha Habibi will discuss the indications for transfusion during pregnancy. Pregnancy is a high-risk situation for both mother and child. Recent studies and meta-analyses tend to favor transfusion during pregnancy, but no randomized studies have been conducted to date. The frequency of transfusion complications in pregnant women, such as post-transfusion hyperhemolysis, makes decision-making difficult. As recommended by the ASH guidelines, the decision should be made case-by-case, based on each patient's transfusion history and complications associated with SCD. Dr. Shannon Kelly will review the different transfusion methods that are available when transfusion is indicated : simple RBC transfusion or RBC exchange which can be automated or manual. The role of these different methods depends not only on local resources, but also on the transfusion indication and a number of patient-dependent parameters. Risks and benefits will be discussed. Dr. France Pirenne will define the patients at risk for transfusion: they are those who previously developed RBC antibodies and/or post-transfusion hyperhemolysis. In these situations, prevention of additional reactions with specific transfusion protocols is necessary, immunosupressive therapy is frequently given, and close transfusion monitoring is implemented. In patients with severe disease, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be indicated. However, transfusion is also required in this context, and its management is complex as transfusion risks must be taken into account.

Microangiopathic Emergencies Life threatening classical hematology disorders including the thrombotic microangiopathies and coagulopathies in critically ill patients often present as medical emergencies, requiring rapid evaluation and treatment to optimize outcomes. Dr. Jennifer McIntosh will discuss microangiopathic emergencies in pregnancy focusing on the diagnosis and management of preeclampsia with severe features, HELLP Syndrome, and DIC, which are the most common causes of microangiopathic emergencies. She will also review when other microangiopathic emergencies (Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy, TTP, Complement Mediated microangiopathy, antiphospholipid syndrome) should be considered instead. Dr. Shruti Chaturvedi will discuss the critical first 24 hours in evaluating a patient with a possible thrombotic microangiopathy focusing on how to rapidly identify and treat patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP) and complement mediated TMA. Dr. Beverley Hunt will review consumptive coagulopathy in the ICU covering conditions ranging from the hemostatic effects of major hemorrhage to the use of extracorporeal circuits and true disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She will review the current understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of common consumptive coagulopathy in critically ill patients, with particular emphasis on DIC because it is a common and often life-threatening condition in critical care patients.
