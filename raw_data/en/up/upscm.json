Rockville, MD: Agency f or 2017. www .effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/reports/final.cfm. doi: https://doi.org/ 10.23970/AHRQEPCCER189. ii The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), through its Evidence- based Practice Centers (EPCs), sponsors the development of systematic reviews to assist public - and private-sector organizations in their efforts to improve the quality of health care in the United States. These reviews provide comprehensive, science-based information on common, costly medical conditions, and new health care technologies and strategies. Systematic reviews ar e the building blocks underlying evidence- based practice; they focus attention on the strength and limits of evidence from research studies about the effectiveness and safety of a clinical intervention. In the context of developing recommendations for prac tice, systematic reviews can help clarify whether assertions about the value of the intervention are based on strong evidence from clinical studies. For more information about AHRQ EPC systematic reviews, see www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/reference/purpose.cfm . AHRQ expects that these systematic reviews will be helpful to health plans, providers, purchasers, government programs, and the health care system as a whole. Transparency and stakeholder input are essential to the Effective Health Care Program.

To evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of medical interventions (defined broadly as interventions involving the administration of external substances to t he body or use of external nonbehavioral procedures to treat symptoms of autism spectrum disorder [ASD] ) for children with ASD. Data sources. We searched MEDLINE\u00ae, Embase\u00ae, the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and PsycI NFO\u00ae from January 2010 through September 2016. Review methods. We included comparative studies of medical interv entions that included at least 10 children with ASD. Two investigators independently screened studies and rated risk of bias. We extracted and summarized data qualitatively given significant heterogeneity. We also assessed strength of the evidence (SOE) and considered cumulative data from eligible studies included in our 2011 review of medical therapies and newly published studies . Results. The 76 unique comparative studies (including 12 comparative studies addressed in the 2011 review) meeting our criter ia included 72 randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ), 2 nonrandomized trial s, and 2 retrospective cohort studies . Thirty -nine studies had low, 29 had moderate, and 8 had high risk of bias. Populations, treatment approaches, and outcomes assessed varied acros s studies. Relative to placebo , seven studies addressing risperidone or aripiprazole reported statistically significant improvements in challenging behavior in the short term (< 6 months ) but also clinically significant harms . Longer term effectiveness was reported in uncontrolled extensions. Three studies comparing risperidone and aripiprazole reported few significant differences in effects on weight gain between agents. RCTs addressing methylphenidate (n=2), atomoxetine (n=2), and guanfacine with frequent harms. Omega- 3 fatty acids (4 RCTs) were not associated with changes in challenging behavior. N-acetylcysteine and tetrahydrobiopterin were not associated with improvements in social skills and symptom severity, respectively. Despite the number of RCTs with low or moderate risk of bias addressing nutritional supplements or specialized diets, evidence is insufficient for all clinical efficacy and harms outcomes because few, small studies addressed each diet or supplement. Similarly, although 14 RCTs with low or moderate risk of bias compared risperidone plus an adjunct medication with risperidone plus placebo, few addressed the same adjunct agents . Studies of hyperbaric oxygen therapy versus sham treatment using differing protocols reported conflicting results. Fourteen studies addressed other interventions, most evaluated in only one study, and typically reported some positive treatment effects on sleep, ASD symptoms, or language. Conclusions. Rispe ridone and aripiprazole ameliorated challenging behaviors in the short term, but with clinically significant side effects (high SOE ). Methylphenidate and atomoxetine were also associated with improvements in hyperactivity in small short- term RCTs (low SOE) , with improvements maintained over 6 months for atomoxetine (low SOE for longer term effects). Methylphenidate was associated with clinically significant harms (low SOE) , while atomoxetine vii was associated with clinically moderate harms (low SOE) . Omega -3 fatty acid supplementation, N-acetylcysteine, and tetrahydrobiopterin failed to show benefits (low SOE). Evidence for other interventions and outcomes studied was insufficient. While the conduct of studies has improved considerably over time (i.e., growing number of RCTs and use of standardized measures), data on longer term ( 6 months) results and harms of most interventions are lacking. Similarly, more research is needed to understand characteristics of the child or treatment that modify outcomes, whether effectiveness of interventions generalizes across different settings such as the home or school, and how components of interventions may drive effects. viii Contents Executive Summary ................................................................................................................ES -1 Introduction ....................................................................................................................................1 Background ................................................................................................................................1 Treatment of ASD ................................................................................................................1 Scope and Key Question s ..........................................................................................................2 Scope of Review ..................................................................................................................2 Key Questions ......................................................................................................................2 Analytic Framework .................................................................................................................4 Organization of This Report ......................................................................................................5 Uses of This Evidence Report ....................................................................................................6 Methods ...........................................................................................................................................7 Topic Surveillance and Review Protocol ...................................................................................7 Literature Search Strategy ..........................................................................................................7 Search Strategy ....................................................................................................................7 Inclusion Criteria .................................................................................................................8 Study Selection ....................................................................................................................9 Data Extraction ....................................................................................................................9 Data Synthesis ..........................................................................................................................10 Risk of Bias Assessment of Individual Studies .......................................................................10 Determining Overall Risk of Bias Ratings ..............................................................................10 Strength of the Body of Evidence ............................................................................................11 Applicability ............................................................................................................................12 Peer Review and Public Commentary .....................................................................................12 Results ...........................................................................................................................................13 Results of L iterature Searches for Key Questions ...................................................................13 Description of Included Studies .........................................................................................14 Gray Literature ...................................................................................................................15 KQ1.

Detailed Tables of Findings xi Executive Summary Introduction Autism s pectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder broadly defined by impaired social c ommunication as well as restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior and interest. As defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth edition (DSM -5), specific features of ASD include deficits in social and emotional reciprocit y (e.g., atypical social approaches, conversational impairment, atypical sharing of interests, attention, and affect); deficits in nonverbal communication (e.g., poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communication, atypical body -language and gesture use, deficits in use and understanding of nonverbal communication), and deficits in maintaining appropriate relationships (e.g., challenges with peer interest, vulnerabilities forming friendships, difficulties adjusting behavior to suit social contexts) as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior such as stereotyped speech, motor movements, or use of objects; excessive adherence to routine or insistence on sameness; intense interest patterns; and atypical sensory interests or responses. Symptoms of the disorder impair and limit everyday functioning and are thought to be evident in early childhood; although they may not be fully evident until later ages. Although not core symptom s, many children with ASD may also have significant cognitive and langua ge impairments . Treatment of ASD The manifestation and severity of symptoms of ASD differ widely, and treatments include a range of behavioral, psychosocial, educational, medical, and complementary approaches1-4 that vary by a child's age and developmental status. The goals of treatment for ASD typically focus on improving core deficits in communication, social interactions, or restricted behaviors, as changing these fundamental deficits may help children develop g reater functional skills and independence. 5 Treatment frequently is complicated by symptoms or comorbidities that may warrant targeted intervention. Individual goals for treatment vary for different children and may include combinations of approaches such as behavioral and medical therapies ; parents may also pursue complementary and alternative medicine therapies. The antipsychotics risperidone (Risperdal) and aripiprazole (Abilify) have been specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of irritability and challenging behaviors in ASD . Many other medications are used off -label to manage behavioral symptoms such as anxiety and hyperactivity. In addition, devices such as hyperbaric oxygen chambers may be used to treat symptoms of ASD. Scope and Key Questions (KQs) Scope of the Review This review updates findings reported in the 2011 AHRQ review Therapies for Children with ASD6 with a focus on studies of medical i nterventions. We defined medical interventions broadly as interventions involving the administration of external substances to the body or use of external, nonbehavioral procedures to treat symptoms of ASD, which includes pharmacologic agents, diet therapi es, vitamins and supplements, chelating agents, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation and hyperbaric oxygen, among other modalities. We used this broad definition, developed with input from our clinical experts, in order to capture t he landscape ES-1 of medically -related interventions used to treat children with ASD. A companion review updating findings related to interventions targeting sensory challenges is available on the AHRQ Effective Health Care W eb site. Key Questions We developed KQs in consultation with Key Informants and Task Order Officers. KQs were posted for review to the AHRQ Effective Health Care W eb site. KQs were as follows: KQ1: Among children ages 2 -12 with ASD, what is the comparative effectiveness (benefits and har ms) of medical treatments? a. What are the effects on core symptoms (e.g., deficits in social communication and interaction; restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities including hyper - or hypo - reactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment) in the short term (<6 months)? b. What are the effects on commonly associated symptoms (e.g., motor, medical, mood/anxiety, irritability, and hyperactivity) in the short term (<6 months)? c. What are the longer term effects (6 months) on core symptoms (e.g., social deficits, communication deficits, and repetitive behaviors)? d. What are the longer term effects (6 months) on commonly associated symptoms (e.g., motor, medical, mood/anxiety, irritability, and hyperac tivity)? KQ2: Among children ages 2 -12 with ASD, what are the modifiers of outcome for different medical treatments? a. Is the effectiveness of the therapies reviewed affected by the frequency, duration, intensity, or dose of the intervention? b. Is the effectiv eness of the therapies reviewed affected by co - interventions or prior treatment , or the training and/or experience of the individual providing the therapy? c. What characteristics (e.g., age, symptom severity), if any, of the child modify the effectiveness of the therapies reviewed? d. What characteristics, if any, of the family modify the effectiveness of the therapies reviewed? KQ3: What is the time to effect of medical interventions? ES-2 KQ4: What is the evidence that effects measured at the end of the treatment phase predict long-term functional outcomes of medical interventions? KQ5: Is the effectiveness of medical interventions maintained across environments or contexts (e.g., people, places, materials)? KQ6: What evidence supports specific components of trea tment with medical interventions as driving outcomes, either within a single treatment or across treatments? Analytic Framework The analytic framework (Figure A) illustrate s the population, interventions, and outcomes that guided the literature search and synthesis . Figure A. Analytic framework ASD=autism spectrum disorder; KQ=Key Question ES-3 Methods Topic Surveillance The topic for a 2011 report on therapies for children with ASD6 was nominated by Autism Speaks in a public process using the Effective Health Care W eb site. AHRQ published an update addressing behavioral interventions in 2014.7 We conducted a surveillance pr ocess to assess the need to update the earlier report by contacting topic experts about the relevance of the KQs and new evidence that may address them. In consultation with clinical experts and stakeholders, and based on our preliminary scan of the litera ture and surveillance findings, we focused the review update on medical approaches and approaches to address sensory challenges (reported in a separate update). These areas reflect both areas of clinical relevance and sufficient newly published literature for a review update. Literature Search Strategy To ensure comprehensive retrieval of relevant studies of medical therapies for children with ASD, we used four key databases: the MEDLINE\u00ae medical literature database via the PubMed\u00ae interface; EMB ASE (Excer pta Medica Database); the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and PsycINFO\u00ae. Search strategies applied a combination of controlled terms and key words . We last conducted searches for the review in September 2016. We hand sea rched the reference lists of recent systematic reviews or meta -analyses of studies addressing therapies for ASD . The investigative team also scanned the reference lists of studies included after the full -text review phase for additional potentially relevan t studies. Inclusion Criteria Table A lists our inclusion criteria. We focused the review on children between 2 and 12 years of age. We chose to limit the age range to this span because a) diagnosis of ASD earlier than age 2 is less established and b) adolescents likely have substantially different challenges and would warrant different interventions than children in the preschool, elementary , and middle school age groups. Table A. Inclusion criteria Category Criteria Study population Children ages 2 -12 w ith ASD (mean age plus standard deviation is 12 years and 11 months) Publication languages English only Admissible evidence (study design and other criteria) Admissible designs Randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies with comparison groups , and nonrandomized controlled trials Other criteria Original research studies published from 2010\u2014present and not addressed in prior reviews Studies must have relevant population and 20 participants with ASD (non-RCTs) or at least 10 tota l participants (RCTs) Studies must address one or more of the following for ASD: -Outcomes of interest -Treatment modality of interest ES-4 Category Criteria -Predictors or drivers of treatment outcomes (e.g., biomarkers, clinical changes) -Maintenance of outcomes across environments or contexts -Sufficiently detailed methods and results to enable data extraction -Report ing of outcome data by target population or intervention ASD = autism spectrum disorder ; RCT = randomized controlled trial Study Selection Two reviewers independently assessed each abstract and the full text of studies proceeding to full text review. A senior reviewer adjudicated disagreements in full text review . Data Extraction and Synthesis Data were initially extracted by one team member and reviewed for accuracy by a second. We summarized data for KQs qualitatively using summary tables as studies were too heterogeneous to allow for meta- analyses. Risk- of-Bias Assessment of Individual Studies We evaluated the overall methodologic risk of bias of individua l studies using the ASD - specific assessment approach developed and used in our prior review s of interventions for ASD and informed by the Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews .8 Two senior investigators assessed each included study independently with d isagreements resolved through discussion. Appendix D of the main report includes ratings for each study. Strength of the Body of Evidence Two senior investigators graded the strength of the evidence (SOE) for key intervention/outcome pairs using methods based on the Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews.8 We assessed the domains of study limitations (low, medium, high level of limitation), consistency (inconsistency not present, inconsistency present, unknown), directness (direct, indirect), precision (precise, imprecise), and reporting bias (detected, unsuspected) . The full team reviewed the final SOE designation s. The possible grades were: High: High confidence that the evidence ref lects the true effect. Further research is unlikely to change estimates. Moderate: Moderate confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research may change our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low: Low co nfidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is likely to change confidence in the estimate of effect and is also likely to change the estimate. Insufficient: Evidence is either unavailable or does not permit a conclusion. 9 Applicability We assessed the applicability of findings reported in the included literature addressing our KQs to the general population of children with ASD by determining the population, intervention, comparator, and s etting in each study and developing an overview of these elements for each intervention category. We anticipated that areas in which applicability would be especially important to describe would include ASD severity, comorbidities, age at treatment, and ES-5 intervention characteristics such provider, dosing/intensity, and setting . Applicability tables are in Appendix E of the full report . Results We identified 6583 nonduplicative titles or abstracts with potential relevance, with 554 proceeding to full text re view. We excluded 469 studies at full text review . We included 68 unique studies ( 85 publications) in the review. In addition to these 68 studies published since the completion of our original review of therapies for children with ASD in 2011, we include 12 comparative studies addressed in the 2011 review that also addressed an agent reported on in the current review. Four studies included in the 2011 review now include followup analyses published since the completion of that report; thus we describe a tota l of 76 studies in the review. The 76 studies included in the review comprised 72 randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ), 2 nonrandomized trial s, and 2 retrospective cohort studies. Studies addressed the following categories: Antipsychotics: 11 RCTs and one retrospective cohort study (n=1055 children) with low (n=7) and moderate (n=5) risk of bias. Medications to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) : Five RCTs (n=265 children) with low (n=4) and moderate (n=1) risk of bias. Combination medi cal and behavioral treatments: Three RCTs and two nonrandomized trials (n=419 children) with low (n=2), moderate (n=1) and high (n=2) risk of bias. Nutritional supplements and dietary interventions: 19 RCTs (n=732 children) with low (n=4), moderate risk RCTs (n =561 children ) with moderate bias . Hyperbaric oxygen therapy: Three RCTs (n=150 children) with low risk of bias. N-acetylcysteine: Two RC Ts (n=123 children) with low and moderate risk of bias . Tetrahydrobiopterin: Two RCTs (n= 56 children) with low and moderate risk of bias . Other interventions: 13 RCTs and 1 retrospective cohort study (n=829 children) with low (n=6), moderate (n=7), and hig h (n=1) risk of bias. We categorized studies as \"other\" if we could not assess strength of evidence for interventions and outcomes reported (i.e., insufficient strength of evidence) and the studies did not fall under a broader category of intervention suc h as diet or nutritional supplements. Overall, 39 studies had low , 29 had moderate, and 8 had high risk of bias. Despite the high number of low and moderate risk of bias studies, few studies addressed the same interventions or outcomes, and most studies included few participants, evaluated only in the short term (< 6 months). T hus, evidence for many agents remains insufficient. Because few studies addressed subquestions under Key Questions (KQ) 1 and 2, we present results in the aggregate under each of these KQ. KQ1. Benefits and Harms of Medical Treatments Antipsychotics. Studies of antipsychotics addressed either risperidone or aripiprazole and reported significant improvements in measures of challenging behavior in the short term (<6 months) in childre n receiving the medications compared with those receiving placebo. Harms of ES-6 these agents, including extrapyramidal symptoms and weight gain, were also clinically significant. Studies reporting longer term followup (up to 21 months for risperidone) reported continued effectiveness in most children but did not include control groups. Medications to treat ADHD . RCTs of methylphenidate, atomoxetine, and guanfacine reported improvements in hyperactivity and other challenging behaviors with treatment compared wi th placebo. Clinically s ignificant side effects were associated with methylphenidate including aggressive behavior and appetite changes. Harms reported with atomoxetine and guanfacine included irritability, gastrointestinal symptoms, drowsiness, and decrea sed appetite. Studies of combined medical and behavioral treatments. In three of the five studies of combined medical and behavioral treatments, the addition of a behavioral therapy (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, parent training) did not increase ef fectiveness over medical therapy alone. In two small trials, bumetanide plus applied behavior analysis improved symptom severity more than applied behavioral analysis alone and stem cell transplantation plus rehabilitation therapy improved symptom severity , lethargy, and stereotypy more than umbilical cord blood cell transplant plus rehabilitation therapy or rehabilitation therapy alone. Diet and nutritional s upplements. Omega -3 fatty acid supplementation did not affect challenging behaviors and was not a ssociated with clinically significant harms. Seven studies addressed variations of the gluten -free diet, but studies addressed different outcomes and different approaches to restricted and control diets. Similarly, a number of RCTs with low or moderate ri sk of bias addressed other agents, but studies were small and few addressed the same agent or outcomes. Risperidone adjuncts. Study pentoxifylline, galantamine, and piracetam. Most studies (12 of 14) reported improvements in irritability measured on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) in the adjunct groups compared with placebo plus risperidone. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy . Three RCTs of hyperbaric oxygen used different doses and reported inconsistent outcomes and harms. N-acetylcysteine. N -acetylcysteine had no effect on social skills outcomes in two small RCT s. Harms of this agent were not clinically significant. Tetrahydrobiopterin. Tetrahydrobiopterin had no effect on symptom severity and was not associated with clinically significant harms. Other medical i nterventions. Few studies addressed the same agen t or reported some positive effects on outcomes including symptom severity, language, and sleep. Studies of oxytocin and mecamylamine reported no statistically significant effects. Harms reported in studies comparing these interventions were diverse, and their clinical significance is difficult to determine. ES-7 KQ2 . Modifiers of Treatment Outcomes Few studies reported modifier s, and few were likely adequately powered to detect effects. In one subanalysis, higher baseline irritability was associated with greater improvement in irritability than was low severity in improvement with risperidone . Greater weight gain was associated with less irritability improvement in the risperidone group. In another study of risperidone, younger age and better communication skills were associated with greater gains in communication but not with gains in daily living skills or socialization. Studi es of stimulants identified no significant phenotypic predictors of effects (e.g., baseline cognitive skills, age, IQ), but one genetic analysis identified seven genetic variations that predicted response to methylphenidate. Modifiers reported in studies of other agents were varied and included cognitive skills, age, and symptom severity. No characteristics had consistent effects. KQ3 . Time to Effect of Interventions While several studies reported changes in the number of children responding to a given ag ent over time, studies typically did not provide data to determine the initiation of effects. KQ4 . Evidence that Effects Measured at the End of Treatment Predict Long -Term Functional Outcomes Few studies had longer term followup and those with more than 6 months of treatment or followup typically did not report functional outcomes. In one study, risperidone use was not associated with changes in IQ: changes from baseline to the end of study in class assignment (e.g., special education, regular classroom) w ere not significant. KQ5 . Effectiveness Across Environments or Contexts Seven studies reported teacher ratings of outcome measures that provide some information to address this KQ , but the limited results preclude conclusions . One RCT of omega -3 fatty aci ds reported no significant group differences in teacher ratings of challenging behaviors (parents also rated few measures as improved), while another RCT of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation versus placebo reported improvement in parent -rated soci al skills in children receiving placebo vs. those receiving DHA, while teachers rated communication as more improved in the treatment group compared with placebo. An RCT of challenge foods introduced to a gluten -free diet reported no statistically signific ant changes in behavior as rated by parents or teachers on the Connors scale. An RCT of levetiracetam vs. placebo reported no significant group differences on any parent - or teacher - rated measures but also noted that teachers, but not parents, rated child ren in the placebo arm as more improved on irritability compared with the levetiracetam group. RCTs of methylphenidate reported general agreement between parent and teacher ratings of hyperactivity. In one RCT, both parents and teachers considered hyperact ivity and impulsive behavior to be significantly improved in the treatment group compared with placebo, but teachers (vs. parents) reported no significant group differences in inattention or oppositional behavior. Finally, one RCT of atomoxetine reported s ignificant teacher -rated improvements in hyperactivity in the atomoxetine group compared with placebo but teacher ratings of cognitive problems/inattention, oppositional behavior, or overall ADHD symptoms did not differ between ES-8 groups. In another RCT compa ring atomoxetine alone, atomoxetine + parent training , placebo alone, and placebo + parent training, parents, but not teachers, rated children in active treatment groups as significantly improved on measures of ADHD, inattention, hyperactivity, and opposi tional behavior. KQ6 . Drivers of Treatment Outcomes We did not identify any studies that provided data to address this KQ. Discussion State of the Literature We identified a total of 76 unique comparative studies, primarily (n=72) RCTs, addressing medic al interventions. Most studies were small (median 40 total participants/study) and addressed variable agents. Most studies had placebo comparators, while five compared a pharmaceutical agent to behavioral treatment or combined pharmaceutical and behavioral treatment. Studies were typically of short duration ( <6 months, range 4 days to 24 months ), with few studies reporting longer term followup after the immediate intervention period . The methodologic rigor of studies has increased substantially compared wit h those studies reported in our 2011 review of therapies for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). 6 However, while studies were generally well conducted, evidence remains insufficient for most interventions due to small sample sizes, lack of long term followup, and heterogeneous agents and populations. Despite the number of new studies, we can make few conclusions beyond those reached in our 2011 review. Evidence supports the effectiveness of antipsychotics in improving challenging behaviors, but with significant harms. Methylphenidate also improves hyperactivity but with significant harms. Evidence is promising for the ADHD medication atomoxetine. More studies have addressed combination approaches, but data are inadequate to draw conclusions. Data were limited and inconsistent for other interventions. Strength of Evidence KQ1. Benefits and Harms of Medical Treatments Antipsychotics. Our confidence in the conclusion that risperidone and aripiprazole improve challenging behaviors in the short term (<6 months), with clinically significant harms, is high (high strength of evidence) . Behaviors improved in the longer term ( 6 months) with these agents compared with placebo, but our confidence in this conclusion is low (low strength of evide nce) as only five studies had 6 months followup. In studies comparing risperidone and aripipraz ole, BMI increased with both drugs over treatment durations of 6 months to more than 2 years, but group differences were not significant. We have low confidence that effects on BMI do not differ between agents given the few studies addressing this outcome (low strength of evidence). Other outcomes (e.g., challenging behaviors, attention) were not consistently addressed; thus we considered strength of evidence insufficient for all other intervention/outcome pairs. Table B outlines findings for all comparisons with greater than insufficient strength of evidence. ES-9 Medications to treat ADHD . Methylphenidate versus placebo improved hyperactivity and was associated with clinically significant harms (Table B) . Our confidence in these conclusions is low as studies w ere small and short term (low strength of evidence). Data were inadequate to assess effects on social communication and oppositional behavior (insufficient strength of evidence). Findings for oppositional behavior were inconsistent in two studies; thus, we could not assess the strength of evidence (insufficient). We considered the evidence inadequate to comment on potential effects on social communication or oppositional behavior (insufficient strength of evidence). We found positive effects of atomoxetine compared with placebo on hyperactivity in children with ASD and ADHD in the short term (<6 months), with effects maintained over the longer term (6 months) (Table B) . Our confidence in this conclusion is low (low strength of evidence). Atomoxetine was associated with harms considered to be clinically moderate, and our confidence in this conclusion is low (low strength of evidence). Data were inadequate to assess effects on inattention as studies reported inconsistent findings (insufficient strength of evidence). Data were inadequate in a small study of guanfacine to draw conclusions about effects on any outcomes (insufficient strength of evidence). Studies of combination medical and behavioral treatments . Given that combination therapies were investigated in single studies, we could not make conclusions about their effect s on any outcomes (insufficient strength of evidence). Nutritional supplements and dietary interventions. Omega -3 fatty acid supplementation and placebo did not affect challenging behaviors. Our confidence in this conclusion is low (low strength of evidence for no effect) (Table B). We also have low confidence in the conclusion that omega -3 supplementation was associated with minimal harms (low strength of evidence). Despite the number of RCTs with low or moderate risk of bias addressing other agents, evidence was inadequate to make conclusions about all clinical efficacy and harms outcomes because few, small, underpowered studies addressed each diet or supplement (insufficient strength of evidence). Data in two small studies of methyl- B12 were inadequate t o draw conclusions (insufficient strength of evidence). While seven studies addressed variations of the gluten -free diet, studies addressed different outcomes and different approaches to restricted and control diets; thus, data were inadequate to make conc lusions about the body of evidence (insufficient strength of evidence). Data were inadequate to allow conclusions about the relative effectiveness of other dietary interventions (e.g., camels' milk, challenge foods containing gluten ) compared with placebo (insufficient strength of evidence). Risperidone adjuncts . Data were inadequate to assess effects any outc ome assessed as no study addressed the same adjunctive agent (insufficient strength of evidence) . While two RCTs address ed risperidone plus N - acetylcysteine, data are inadequate to comment on effects given the small number of participants and high attritio n (insufficient SOE) . Hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Three RCTs of hyperbaric oxygen used different doses and reported inconsistent results. We considered SOE to be insufficient to assess effects. ES-10 N-acetylcysteine. N -acetylcysteine had no effect on social skills outcomes in two small RCTs; harms of this agent were not clinically significant. Our confidence in these conclusions is low (low strength of evidence) (Table B). Data were inadequate to assess effects on other outcomes given inconsistent findings in these two studies (insufficient strength of evidence). Tetrahydrobiopterin. Tetrahydrobiopterin had no effect on symptom severity and was not associated with clinically significant harms. Our confidence in these conclusions is low (low strength of evide nce) (Table B). Data were inadequate to assess effects on other outcomes (insufficient strength of evidence). Studies of other medical interventions. Data were inadequate to make conclusions about the effects of amantadine, vs. placebo as few studies addressed the sa me agents or outcomes (insufficient strength of evidence). Table B.

Few studies reported data to assess time to effect of interventions. Few studies had ES-12 longer -term followup and those few with 6 months or more of treatment or followup typically did not report functional outcomes; thus our understanding of whether effects at the end of treatment predict functional outcomes is limited. Four studies reported teacher ratings of outcome measures that provide some inf ormation to address effectiveness of treatments across environments or contexts, but the limited results preclude conclusions . Finally, we did not identify studies that provided data to address drivers of treatment outcomes. Applicability Study participan ts were generally recruited from specialty clinical service programs and represent non-primary care populations. As such, families of these children may be seeking a higher level of care than those of the broader population of children with ASD based upon more severe or acute symptoms, including aggression or other challenging behaviors. Most studies of medical interventions targeted elementary school aged and older children with autism, with little data on the treatment of younger children. Most s tudies in cluded majority male populations (consistent with the male prevalence of ASD). Studies also included children with highly variable severity of challenging behaviors, ASD symptom severity, and cognitive impairment. Studies of pharmacological agents often sampled children with high levels of specific symptom patterns (e.g., children with severe challenging behavior at baseline where parents may be willing to pursue pharmacologic intervention and trial participation) who may not reflect the wider population of children with ASD in whom these challenges may not be present. Most of the studies reported including children with at least moderate level of severity of ASD. Studies of stimulants included children with cognitive impairmen t and with comorbidities including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder. Studies of other approaches had similarly heterogeneous populations. Dietary and nutritional studies included some younger children, with seve rity of autism not well described or the degree of intellectual functioning not well characterized in most studies. This heterogeneity in population characteristics may limit the generalizability of findings to children with differing levels of symptom exp ression or comorbidities but likely reflects the heterogeneity of the broader population of children with ASD. Studies addressed a variety of agents and typically reported use of concurrent medications or other therapies. Most agents studied are accessib le in the United States albeit with few receiving FDA approval for use. Comparators among nonplacebo controlled studies varied, and few studies assessed the effect of concomitant behavioral or other therapies, though many children with ASD receive multiple interventions. The treatments studied may not adequately reflect the broad range of treatment combinations used in the general population of children with ASD. As noted, few studies evaluated longer term treatment (6 months); short treatment and followup periods limit our ability to understand potential longer term outcomes such as academic achievement or longer term harms. Overall , the heterogeneity of these studies parallels the heterogeneity of children with ASD, and some findings may be more applica ble to children with specific levels of baseline severity or comorbidities. These limitations to generalizability likely reflect both the significant heterogeneity of ASD itself as well as its associated features, such as irritability. Thus, while there is a growing evidence base for treating certain symptoms in certain populations, these findings underscore the continued need for individualized treatment approaches that are informed by the emerging evidence base for benefits as well as harms of medical int ervention, ES-13 with careful consideration of symptom presentation and functioning level relative to study populations and applicability of the known literature. Limitations of the Comparative Effectiveness Review Process We included studies published in Eng lish only and did not include unpublished data. In our scan of a random sample of 150 non- English abstracts retrieved by our MEDLINE search , only two studies appeared to meet inclusion criteria; thus, given the high percentage of ineligible items in this s can (9 9%), we concluded that excluding non- English studies would not introduce significant bias into the review . We recognize that this preliminary scan did not address the entire corpus of ASD literature in other languages . We also included only comparat ive studies of medical interventions with at least 10 children with ASD. To ensure comprehensive coverage of the literature, we included comparative studies with a smaller sample size that would have been excluded in our 2011 review (which required a sampl e size of 30) in the present report. We did not conduct a de novo search for such studies but re-examined the excluded studies from the prior review. This approach may have overlooked relevant studies. Given heterogeneity in treatment regimens, outcomes a ddressed in each study, and patient populations, we were limited in our ability to meta -analyze findings or identify potential subgroups that may respond more favorably to specific treatments. Finally, we used a nonvalidated tool to assess risk of bias, though we note that the tool evaluates similar constructs to those assessed in tools such as that used by the Cochrane Collaboration, with the addition of ASD- specific domains. Limitations of the Evidence Base As noted, studies in the review had small sample sizes and typically limited duration of intervention and followup after intervention, despite significant improvements in study design and execution over time. Populations across studies were heterogeneous in terms of challenging behaviors, ASD symptom se verity, age, and comorbidities. Few studies addressed the same agent and outcomes, and few assessed potential factors that may modify effectiveness or drive effects of interventions. Many (n=63) studies also explicitly noted that concomitant interventions were held steady during the study treatment period; however, few studies reported specific analyses to control for or assess the effects of additional treatments. Despite these limitations, investigators have made significant improvements in incorporating commonly used measures of symptom severity and behavior to facilitate comparisons across studies. Studies also typically described interventions fully, used standardized diagnostic processes and blinded assessors, and reported on the use or restriction of concomitant interventions. Implications for Clinical and Policy Decisionmaking This review provides some evidence for decisionmaking about medical interventions for children with ASD. The clearest evidence favors the use of the antipsychotics r isperidone and aripiprazole to address challenging behaviors in the short -term (<6 months); however, clinicians and caregivers must balance the significant harms of these agents. The s ignificant side effect profiles make it clear that although these drugs are effi cacious, caution is warranted regarding their use in patients without severe impairments or risk of injury . Few studies addressed longer ES-14 term effects of these agents; thus, our confidence in longer term ( 6 months) effectiveness is low. Studies of adjuncts to risperidone typically reported positive effects on challenging behaviors, but few studies addressed the same agents, precluding our ability to draw conclusions about their effectiveness. Some evidenc e supports the use of methylphenidate and atomoxetine for hyperactivity, but few comparative studies addressed each agent, so our confidence in effects is limited. Given that many children with ASD are currently treated with medical interventions, striking ly little evidence exists to support clear benefit for most medical interventions, especially in the realm of interventions such as restrictive diets and supplements. Studies of nutritional supplements or specialized diets were typically underpowered and p rovided little evidence of effects of these approaches. Several agents were addressed in single studies, which limits conclusions about their effects. Decisional dilemmas remain regarding characteristics of the child, family, or intervention that may mod ify effectiveness or predict which children may be most likely to benefit from a given approach. Similarly, the literature base is currently insufficient to inform our understanding of the time to effect of interventions, longer term effectiveness of inter ventions, generalizability of effects outside the treatment context, effectiveness and applicability to broader ASD populations, and components that may drive effectiveness. Research Gaps and Areas for Future Research Improving research in this area should include methodologic considerations of power and sample size and durability of effects. S ample size and participant followup were frequently insufficient to allow firm conclusions . Duration of treatment and followup w ere generally short (<6 months); those studies with longer duration of treatment were typically open label extensions of RCTs and lacked control arms. While duration was typically short, retaining participants in studies, especially in placebo arms, is difficult when parents or children perc eive little improvement in symptoms. Longer duration of treatment, however, is also important to rule out meaningful improvements in placebo groups and help inform our understanding of the placebo effect. Few studies provid ed data on long- term outcomes aft er cessation of treatment. Future studies should extend the followup period and assess the degree to which outcomes are durable in \"real world\" situations . The literature includes many single studies of various agents. Studies of adjuncts to risperidone, f or example, examined different adjunct agents, with some positive effects on challenging behaviors reported with most. Understanding which agents should be examined further is lacking. Another critical area for further research is identifying which childre n are likely to benefit from particular interventions. To date, studies have provided limited characteriz ation of the subpopulation of children who experience positive response to medical interventions and limited characterization of the extent or type of behavioral challenges children experience at baseline. Children with ASD also typically receive multiple types of therapies, but few studies addressed combinations of medical and behavioral or other categories of interventions or a medical treatment compa red with a nonmedical treatment. Few attempted to account for potential effects on ongoing interventions. This not only limited our ability to interpret the effects of medical treatments in isolation but represents a significant gap for families and providers in choosing additional treatments that may bolster (or impair) the effects of behavioral, medication, or other therapies. Few studies (n=10) compared active treatments, and future ES-15 research to assess comparative effectiveness of antipsychotics, ADHD med ications, and other medications is necessary. In addition, much of the medical intervention literature relies on baseline and outcome measures that have specific limits in understanding individualized response. Future research attempting to elucidate pote ntial biobehavioral markers of response may prove useful. Research in understanding outcomes of importance to patients and caregivers, such as quality of life, is also lacking. Harms reporting varied across studies; some studies amply described how harms were tracked, while others listed harms with no indication of how they were assessed (e.g., parent recall, checklist, clinician assessment during followup). This lack of reporting makes comparing harms across studies difficult. For instance, while studies of atomoxetine generally reported fewer harms than did studies of methylphenidate in children with ADHD symptoms, exploring differences in safety profiles is an important area for additional research.

Conclusions Risperidone and a ripiprazole ameliorated challenging behaviors in the short term (< 6 months), but had clinically significant side effects. Methylphenidate and atomoxetine were also associated with improvements in hyperactivity in small, short- term RCTs (with uncontrolled open label extensions). Atomoxetine plus parent training was not more effective for hyperactivity than atomoxetine alone. Omega -3 fatty acid supplementation was not associated with improvements in challenging behaviors, and N -acetylcysteine and tetrahydrobi opterin were not associated with improvements in social skills and symptom severity, respectively. Some positive effects were reported with other agents studied (risperidone adjuncts, melatonin), but few studies addressed the same agent or outcomes. Data o n longer term ( 6 months) results and harms of interventions are lacking. Similarly, more research is needed to understand characteristics of the child or treatment that modify outcomes and whether effectiveness of interventions generalizes across different settings such as the home or school. Current evidence also does not inform our understanding of components of interventions that may drive effects. Some therapies hold promise and warrant further study, and the conduct of studies has improved considerably over time (i.e., growing number of RCTs and use of standardized measures). However, additional studies with larger, well- characterized populations over longer time frames, and that utilize transparent and rigorous methods that permit comparison across studies, would further inform decisionmaking.

Berkman ND, Lohr KN, Ansari MT, Grading the strength of a body of evide nce when assessing health care interventions: an EPC ES-17 Autism s pectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder broadly defined by impaired social communication as well as restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior and interest. As defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth edition (DSM -5), specific features of ASD include deficits in social and emot ional reciprocity (e.g., atypical social approaches, conversational impairment, atypical sharing of interests, attention, and affect); deficits in nonverbal communication (e.g., poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communication, atypical body -language and gesture use, deficits in use and understanding of nonverbal communication), and deficits in maintaining appropriate relationships (e.g., challenges with peer interest, vulnerabilities forming friendships, difficulties adjusting behavior to suit social contexts) as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior such as stereotyped speech, motor movements, or use of objects; excessive adherence to routine or insistence on sameness; intense interest patterns; and atypical sensory interests or respon ses. Symptoms of the disorder impair and limit everyday functioning and are thought to be evident in early childhood; although they may not be fully evident until later ages. Although not core symptom s, many children with ASD may also have significant cogn itive impairment and language impairments . The prevalence of ASD in the United States is 14.7 cases per 1,000 children living in the communities surveyed, or 1 in 68, with rate estimates varying widely by region of the country, sex, and race/ethnicity. 1 Considerably more males (1 in 42) than females (1 in 189) are affected. For some individuals, s ymptoms of ASD may improve with intervention and maturation; however, core deficits typically translate into varying developmental presentations that persist throughout the lifespan. 2 Treatment of ASD The manifestation and severity of symptoms of ASD differ widely, and treatments include a range of behavioral, psychosocial, educational, medical, and complementary approaches3-6 that vary by a child's age and developmental status. The goals of treatment for ASD t ypically focus on improving core deficits in communication, social interactions, or restricted behaviors, as changing these fundamental deficits may help children develop greater functional skills and independence. 7 Treatment frequently is complicated by symptoms or comorbidities that may warrant targeted intervention (e.g., significant challenging behavior, attention and hyperactivity concerns, depression, anxiety) . There is no cure for ASD and no global consensus on which intervention is most effective.8, 9 Individual goals for treatment vary for differ ent children and may include combinations of behavioral therapies, educational therapies, medical and related therapies, approaches targeting sensory issues, and allied health therapies; parents may also pursue complementary and alternative medicine therap ies. The antipsychotics risperidone (Risperdal) and aripiprazole (Abilify) have been specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of the comorbid symptoms of irritability and challeng ing behaviors in ASD . No medicatio ns have been approved specifically to treat core ASD symptoms such as communication impairments . Many medications are used off -label to manage behavioral symptoms such as anxiety and hyperactivity. In addition, other treatments such as nutritional suppleme nts or devices such as 1 hyperbaric oxygen chambers have been used to treat symptoms of ASD, though neither supplements or hyperbaric oxygen have been approved by the FDA for ASD treatment.10 Scope and Key Questions Scope of Review This review updates findings reported in the 2011 Agenc y for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ) review of Therapies for Children with ASD11 with a focus on studies of medical interventions. We defined medical interventions broadly as interventions involving the administration of external substances to the body or use of external, nonbehavioral procedures to treat symptoms of ASD, which includes pharmacologic agents, diet therapies, vitamins and supplements, chelating agents, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation and hyperbaric oxygen, among other modalities. We used this broad definition, developed with input from our clinical experts, in order to capture the landscape of medically -related interventions used to treat children with ASD. We focused the review on children between 2 and 12 years of age. W e chose to limit the age range to this span because a) diagnosis of ASD earlier than age 2 is less established and b) adolescents likely have substantially different challenges and would warrant different interventions than children in the preschool, elementary , and middle school age groups. We integrate syntheses of comparative studies evaluating medical interventions addressed in our 2011 review of therapies for children with ASD11 if they addressed an agent evaluated in a study identified for the current review. To ensure comprehensive cove rage of the medical literature in the current update , we also included studies that had originally been excluded in the 2011 review because of sample size. We set a lower sample size inclusion criterion in the current update . A companion review updating f indings related to interventions targeting sensory challenges is available on the AHRQ Ef fective Health Care Web site. Key Questions We developed Key Questions ( KQs) in consultation with Key Informants and the Task Order Officer. KQs were posted for revie w to the AHRQ Effective Health Care Web site. KQs were as follows: KQ1: Among children ages 2 -12 with ASD, what is the comparative effectiveness (benefits and harms) of medical treatments? a. What are the effects on core symptoms (e.g., deficits in social communication and interaction; restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities including hyper - or hypo - reactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment) in the short term ( <6 months)? b. What are the effects on commonly associated symptoms (e.g., motor, medical, mood/anxiety, irritability, and hyperactivity) in the short term ( <6 months)? 2 c. What are the longer term effects ( 6 months) on core symptoms (e.g., social deficits, communication deficits, and repetitive behaviors)? d. What are the longer term effects ( 6 months) on commonly associated symptoms (e.g., motor, medical, mood/anxiety, irritability, and hyperactivity)? KQ2: Among children ages 2 -12 with ASD, what are the modifiers of outcome for different medical treatments? a. Is the effectiveness of the therapies reviewed affected by the frequency, duration, intensity, or dose of the intervention? b. Is the effectiveness of the t herapies reviewed affected by co - interventions or prior treatment , or the training and/or experience of the individual providing the therapy? c. What characteristics (e.g., age, symptom severity), if any, of the child modify the effectiveness of the therapies reviewed? d. What characteristics, if any, of the family modify the effectiveness of the therapies reviewed? KQ3: What is the time to effect of medical interventions? KQ4: What is the evidence that effects measured at the end of the treatment phase predict long-term functional outcomes of medical interventions? KQ5: Is the effectiveness of medical interventions maintained across environments or contexts (e.g., people, places, materials)? KQ6: What evidence supports specific components of treatment with medical interventions as driving outcomes, either within a single treatment or across treatments?

Analytic framework ASD=autism spectrum disorder; KQ=Key Question Organization of This Report The Methods section describes the review processes including search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria, approach to review of abstracts and full publications, methods for extraction of data, and compiling evidence. We also describe our approach to grading the risk of bias of the literature and describing the strength of the body of evidence. The Results section presents the findings of the literature search and the review of the evidence by KQ, synthesizing the fi ndings across strategies. We present findings for each KQ organized by intervention and outcome area . We include summary tabl es in the Results section for those intervention areas for which we could assess the strength of evidence for effectiveness outcomes. All other summary tables are in Appendix F. Because few studies addressed sub-questions under KQ 1 and 2, we present result s in the aggregate under each of these KQ. The Discussion section of the report discusses the results and expands on methodologic considerations relevant to each KQ . We also outline the current state of the literature and challenges for future research i n the field. The report includes a number of appendi xes to provide further detail on our methods and the studies assessed. The appendi xes are as follows: Appendix A: Search Strategies Appendix B: Screening Assessment Forms Appendix C: Exc luded Studies Appendix D : Risk of Bias Ratings Appendix E : Applicability Summary Tables Appendix F : Detailed Tables of Findings 5 Uses of This Evidence Report We anticipate that the report will be of value to clinicians who treat children with ASD, who can u se the report to assess the evidence for different treatment strategies. In addition, this review will be of use to the National Institutes of Health, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and the Health Resources and Services Administration -all of which have offices or bureaus devoted to child health issues and who may use the report to compare treatments and determine priorities for funding. This report can bring practitioners up to date about the curre nt state of evidence related to medical interventions, and it provides an assessment of the quality of studies that aim to determine the outcomes of medical options for the management of ASD. It will be of interest to families affected by ASD because of the recurring need for families and their health care providers to make the best possible decisions among numerous options. We also anticipate it will be of use to private sector organizations concerned with ASD; the report can inform such organizations' understanding of the effectiveness of treatments and the amount and quality of evidence available. Researchers can obtain a concise analysis of the current state of knowledge and future research needs related to medical interventions for ASD . 6 Methods In thi s chapter, we document the procedures that we used to produce a comparative effectiveness review update addressing medical interventions for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These procedures follow the methods outlined in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Effective Health Care Program Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews . 12 Topic Surveillance and Review Protocol The topic for the original report (201111) was nominated by Autism Speaks in a public process using the Effective Health Care W eb site. AHRQ published an update addressing behavioral interventions in 2014.13 We conducted a surveillance process to assess the need t o update the report by contacting topic experts about the relevance of the Key Questions (KQs) and new evidence that may address them. All members of the research team were required to submit information about potential conflicts of interest before initiation of the work. No members of the review team had any conflicts. In consultation with clinical experts and stakeholders, and based on our preliminary scan of the literature and surveillance findings , we focused the review update on medical approaches and approaches to address sensory challenges (reported in a separate update). These areas reflect both areas of clinical relevance and sufficient newly published literature for a review update. Based also on the surveillance process and discussions with stake holders, we revised the Key Questions (KQs) addressed in the 2011 report 11 to reflect the focus on medical and sensory approaches specifically. We also eliminated a question on approaches for children at risk for ASD as such children are unlikely to be included in studies in the tar get areas for this review update. After review from AHRQ, the questions and framework were posted online for public comment. No changes to the questions or framework were recommended. We identified technical experts on the topic to provide assistance during the project. The Technical Expert Panel (TEP), representing the fields of pediatrics and developmental pediatrics , psychiatry , family medicine, and occupational therapy and allied health , contributed to the AHRQ's broader goals of (1) creating and mainta ining science partnerships as well as public -private partnerships and (2) meeting the needs of an array of potential users of its products. Thus, the TEP was both an additional resource and a sounding board during the project. The TEP included seven member s serving as technical or clinical experts. To ensure robust, scientifically relevant work, TEP members participated in conference calls to: Help to refine the analytic framework and KQ at the beginning of the project; Discuss inclusion/exclusion criteri a; and Assist with determining key interventions and outcomes of interest. The final protocol was posted to the AHRQ Effective Health Care W eb site and registered in the PROSPERO international register of systematic reviews (ID# : CRD42016033941). Literature Search Strategy Search Strategy To ensure comprehensive retrieval of relevant studies of medical therapies for children with ASD, we used four key databases: the MEDLINE\u00ae medical literature database via the PubMed\u00ae interface; EMB ASE (Excerpta Medica Database), an international biomedical and 7 pharmacological literature database via the Ovid\u00ae interface; the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and PsycINFO\u00ae. Search strategies for KQs applied a combination of controlled vocabulary (M edical Subject Headings [MeSH] and Emtree headings) and key words to focus specifically on medical interventions for ASD and harms of interventions (Appendix A ). We restricted literature searches for KQs to studies published from 2010 to the present to reflect literature available since the publication of the 2011 review .11 We last conducted searches for the review in September 2016. Gray Literature We searched Web sites of organizations likely to conduct research , issue guidance, or generate polic ies for ASD (e.g., Autism Speaks, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry) to inform the review's background and discussion sections. We searched government and regulatory agency W eb sites for contextual information on benefits and harms of ASD interventions . We searched ClinicalTrials.gov , the International Standard Randomiz ed Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) registry, and other trial registries for information about relevant ongoing trials and to confirm that we had obtained available publications of results from completed trials . Inclusion Criteria Table 2 outlines inclusion criteria. We required that e ligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs ) have a total minimum sample size of 10. We required a higher minimum sample size (n=20) for other comparative studies as they typically have fewer controls for bias than RCTs. We include d studies published in English only. In the opinion of our content experts, much of the relevant literature on ASD is published in English; however, we scanned a sample of 150 non-English a bstracts to gauge the number of anticipated non- English studies that would meet inclusion criteria. Two non- English studies appeared to meet our criteria. Given this small proportion of potentially eligible studies, we feel that excluding these publications is unlikely to introduce significant bias. Eligible studies also reported one or more outcomes of interest and include d children at least 2 years of age and up to and including age 12. As noted, we focused the review on children in this age range given greater diagnostic stability and differences in behaviors and challenges across age ranges. Studies also include d only children with a diagnosis of ASD (or data reported separately for children with ASD) . 8 Table 2. Inclusion criteria Category Criteria Study Population Children ages 2 -12 with ASD (mean age plus standard deviation is 12 years and 11 months) Publication Languages English only Admissible Evidence (Study Design and Other Criteria) Admissible designs Randomized controlled trials, prospecti ve and retrospective cohort studies with comparison groups , and nonrandomized controlled trials Other criteria Original research studies published from 2010\u2014present and not addressed in prior reviews (except for those otherwise eligible studies with a sam ple size of <30 that excluded them from the 2011 review) Studies must have relevant population and 20 participants with ASD (nonRCTs) or at least 10 total participants (RCTs) Studies must address one or more of the following for ASD: -Outcomes of interest -Treatment modality of interest -Predictors or drivers of treatment outcomes (e.g., biomarkers, clinical changes) -Maintenance of outcomes across environments or contexts -Sufficiently detailed methods and results to enable data extraction -Report ing of outcome data by target population or intervention ASD = autism spectrum disorder ; RCT = randomized controlled trial Study Selection Once we identified articles through the electronic database searches and hand -searching, we examined abstracts of articles to determine whether studies met our criteria. Two rev iewers separately evaluated the abstracts of studies identified in our searches for KQs for inclusion or exclusion, using an Abstract Review Form (Appendix B ). If one reviewer concluded that the article could be eligible for the review based on the abstract, we retained it. Following abstract review, two reviewers independently assessed the full text of each included study using a standardized form (Appendix B ) that included questions stemming from our inclusion and exclusion criteria. A senior reviewer res olved disagreements between reviewers. We conducted all abstract and full text reviews using the DistillerSR online screening application (Evidence Partners Incorporated, Ottawa, Ontario). Appendix C includes a list of excluded studies and the reasons for exclusion. Data extracted for each study are available via the Systematic Review Data Repository (http://srdr.ahrq.gov/). Data Extraction The staff members and clinical experts (including two psychiatrists , two psychologists , and three epidemiologists /systematic reviewers ) who conducted this review jointly developed the data extraction forms for the KQs . We designed forms to provide sufficient information to enable readers to understand the studies and to determine their quality; we gave particular emphas is to essential information related to the KQs . The team was trained to extract data by extracting several articles into the template and then reconvening as a group to discuss the utility of the template . We repeated this process through several iterations until we decided that the templates included the appropriate categories for gathering the information contained in the articles and for potential meta -analyses . Team data extractors shared the task of initially entering information into the evidence tabl es. A second team member also reviewed the articles and edited all initial 9 entries for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. A senior reviewer reconciled disagreements concerning the information reported. The full research team met regularly during the article extraction period and discussed issues related to the data extraction process . In addition to outcomes related to the effectiveness of treatment (e.g., changes in ASD severity ), we extracted all data available on harms. Harms encompass the full ra nge of specific negative effects, including the narrow er definition of adverse events . Data Synthesis We summarized data for KQs qualitatively using summary tables. We integrate syntheses of comparative studies evaluating medical interventions addressed in our 2011 review of therapies for children with ASD 11 if they addressed an agent evaluated in a study identified for the current review. We attempted to perform a quantitative meta -analysis for the effects of risperidone on outcomes related to challenging behaviors using a multiv ariate normal response to simultaneously model four outcome scales. However, only four studies satisfied the criteria for inclusion, which included reporting baseline and end- of-treatment (or change from baseline) means and standard deviations. This number of studies limited use of a random effects meta- analysis, which was warranted to account for the variation in outcomes. We fit a prototype model using a fixed effects meta- analysis, but the goodness -of-fit evaluation was very poor, so we elected not conti nue the meta -analysis. We summarize prior meta -analyses and systematic reviews addressing many of the same agents in the Findings in Relation to What Is Already Known section of the report. Risk of Bias Assessment of Individual Studies We evaluated the overall methodologic risk of bias of individual studies using the ASD - specific assessment approach we developed and used in our prior review s of interventions for ASD and informed by the Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews . 12 We developed this tool (Appendix B) because standard risk of bias assessment tools (e.g., Cochrane risk of bias assess ment) do not fully account for the complexity of interventions and populations represented in the ASD literature. Specifically, the tool includes questions to address diagnostic approaches and measures of treatment fidelity that may affect outcomes. The tool has not been formally validated. Two senior investigators assessed each included study independently with d isagreements resolved through discussion or by an independent senior investigator/methodologist. Appendix D includes ratings for each study. Determining Overall Risk of Bias Ratings We used the thresholds we establish in prior reviews to assess overall high, medium or low risk of bias. We assessed the risk of bias based upon the study -defined primary outcome(s). We assessed each domain evaluated in the tool (i.e., study design, participant ascertainment/inclusion, intervention description, outcome measurement, statistical analysis) . We considered the individual ratings to determine an overall quality assessment of low, moderate, or high risk of bias. 10 We required that studies receive positive scores questions related to randomization and diagnostic approach to be considered low risk of bias . We summed and weighted scores as described in Table 3 to determine overall study risk of bias . Studies could receive up to two points on the domains of study design, diagnostic approach, participant ascertainment, and intervention, and up to one point on the domains of outcome measurement and statistical analysis. Table 3. Quality scoring algorithm Definiti on and Scoring Algorithm Rating 8/10 points, including a ++ on study design and ++ on diagnostic approach Low risk of bias 6/10 points, including at least a + on intervention Moderate risk of bias 5/10 points High risk of bias Strength of the Body of Evidence The assessment of the literature is done by considering both the observed effectiveness of interventions and the confidence that we have in the stability of those effects in the face of future research. The degree of confidence that the observ ed effect of an intervention is unlikely to change is presented as strength of evidence, and it can be regarded as insufficient, low, moderate, or high. Strength of evidence describes the adequacy of the current research, both in terms of quantity and qual ity, as well as the degree to which the entire body of current research provides a consistent and precise estimate of effect. Interventions that have demonstrated benefit in a small number of studies but have not yet been replicated using the most rigorous study designs will therefore have insufficient or low strength of evidence to describe the body of research. Future research may find that the intervention is either effective or ineffective. Strength of the evidence is assessed for a limited set of critical outcomes, typically those related to effectiveness of an intervention. Methods for applying strength of evidence assessments are established in the Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews 12 and are based on consideration of five domains (Table 4): study limitations, consistency in direction of the effect, directness in measuring intended outcomes, precision of effect, and reporting bias. Strength of evidence is assessed separately for major intervention -outcome pairs and incorporates data from the entire body of reviewed evidence on behavioral interventions (i.e., comparative studies \u2014both RCTs and prospective and retrospective cohort studies \u2014reported in the 2011 review 11 and studies reported in the current review). We required at least one low risk of bias study for moderate strength of evidence and two low risk studies for high strength of evidence. In addition, to be considered \"moderate\" or higher, intervention- outcome pairs needed a positive response on two out of the three domains other than study limitations. Once we had established the maximum strength of evidence possible based upon these criteria, we assess ed the number of studies and range of study designs for a given intervention- outcome pair, and downgraded the rating when the cumulative evidence was not sufficient to justify the higher rating. The possible grades were: High: High confidence that the evid ence reflects the true effect. Further research is unlikely to change estimates . Moderate: Moderate confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research may change our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. 11 Low: Low confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is likely to change confidence in the estimate of effect and is also likely to change the estimate. Insufficient: Evidence is either unavailable or does not permit a conclusion. Table 4. Domains used to assess strength of evidencea Domain Explanation Study Limitations Degree to which included studies for a given outcome have a high likelihood of adequate protection against bias (i.e., good internal validity), assessed through s tudy design and study conduct. Consistency Degree to which included studies find either the same direction or similar magnitude of effect. Assessed through two main elements: Direction of effect: Effect sizes have the same sign (that is, are on the same side of no effect or a minimally important difference). Magnitude of effect: The range of effect sizes is similar. Directness Extent to which evidence links interventions directly to a health outcome of specific importance for the review, and for comparat ive studies, whether the comparisons are based on head-to -head studies. Evidence may be indirect in several situations such as: Outcome being graded is considered intermediate in a review that is focused on clinical health outcomes (such as morbidity, mor tality). Data do not come from head- to-head comparisons but rather from two or more bodies of evidence to compare. Data are available only for proxy respondents instead of directly from patients for situations in which patients are capable of self -report ing and self -report is more reliable. Precision Degree of certainty surrounding an effect estimate with respect to a given outcome, based on the sufficiency of sample size and number of events. A body of evidence will generally be imprecise if the optim al information size (OIS) is not met. OIS refers to the minimum number of patients (and events when assessing dichotomous outcomes) needed for an evidence base to be considered adequately powered. Reporting bias Degree of selective publishing or reportin g of research findings based on the favorability of direction or magnitude of effect. a Excerpted from Berkman et al. 201314 Applicability We assessed the applicability of findings reported in the included literature addressing our KQs to the general population of children with ASD by determining the population, intervention, comparator, and setting in each study and developing an overview of these elements for each intervention category. We anticipated that areas in which applicability would be especial ly important to describe would include ASD severity, comorbidities, age at treatment, and intervention characteristics such provider, dosing/intensity, and setting . Applicability tables for each KQ are in Appendix E . Peer Review and Public Commentary Researchers and clinicians with expertise in treating children with ASD and individuals representing stakeholder and user communities provided external peer review of this report. The draft report was posted on the AHRQ Web site for 4 weeks to elicit public comment. We address ed all reviewer comments, revised the tex t as appropriate, and document ed changes and revisions to the report in a disposition of comments report that will be made available 3 months after AHRQ posts the final review on the AHRQ Web site. 12 Results Results of Literature Searches for Key Questions We identified 6583 nonduplicative titles or abstracts with potential relevance, with 554 proceeding to full text review (Figure 2). We excluded 469 studies at full text review . We included 68 unique studies ( 85 publications) in the review. In addition to these 68 studies included since the completion of our original review of therapies for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in 2011,11 we include 12 comparative studies addressed in the 2011 review that also addresse d an agent used in the current review . Four studies (reported in multiple publications) included in the 2011 review now include followup analyses published since the completion of that report. 15-39 We outline findings from all 76 studies below. Figure 2. Disposition of studies identified for this review Description of Included Studies The 76 studies included in the review comprised 72 randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) reported in multip le publications ,15-119 two nonrandomized trial s,120, 121 and two retrospective 13 cohort studies.122, 123 Among the 65 studies clearly reporting a funding source, 12 were industry - sponsored,15-21, 40 -44, 48, 51 -53, 67, 75, 101, 108, 112, 113, 115 and the remainder were funded by government health agencies, foundations, or universities. We considered 39 studies to have low risk of bias,15-39, 41 -46, 48 -55, 57, 58, 60, 67, 73 -76, 78, 81, 83, 89 -100, 102, 108, 110, 111, 114 29 to have moderat e,40, 47, 59, 63, 66, 68 -72, 77, 79, 80, 82, 84 -87, 101, 103, 106, 107, 109, 112, 113, 115 - 118, 121, 122, 124 and eight to have high risk.56, 61, 62, 64, 65, 88, 104, 105, 120, 123 Despite the high number of low and moderate risk of bias studies, few studies addressed the same interventions or outcomes, and most studies included few participants, e valuated only in the short term (<6 months); thus, evidence for many agents remains insufficient. Table 5 outlines key study characteristics . Because few studies addressed sub -questions under Key Questions (KQ) 1 and 2, we present results in the aggregate under each of these KQ. Table 5.

Benefits and Harms of Medical Treatments Studies of Antipsychotics Key Points Five RCTs addressing risperidone reported significant improvements in measures of irritability and other challenging behaviors in the treatment group compared with placebo in the short -term (6 months), with continued positive effects over a mean 21- month treatment period in an uncontrolled extension study. Side effects including somnolence and weight gain were clinically significant. Two RCTs of aripiprazole reported statistically significa nt improvements in irritability and challenging behavior in the treatment groups compared with placebo over 8 weeks of treatment and maintenance of improvements in a 52 -week uncontrolled extension. Harms were also clinically significant. Another RCT report ed no differences in time to relapse (return of significant negative symptoms) between children taking aripiprazole versus placebo; quality of life measures also did not differ between groups. Three small studies comparing risperidone with aripiprazole reported no significant differences in effects on challenging behaviors or general improvement; one study noted no significant differences in weight gain associated with each agent. One small RCT reported greater improvements in challenging behavior wi th ris peridone vs. haloperidol, and one comparing r isperidone and memantine and reported no group differences on any outcomes. Risperidone and aripiprazole improved challenging behaviors in the short -term (<6 months) , with clinically significant harms. Our conf idence in these conclusions is high (high strength of evidence). Behaviors improved in the longer term ( 6 months) with these agents compared with placebo , but our confidence in this conclusion is low (low strength of evidence) as few studies had longer -term followup. In studies comparing risperidone and aripiprazole, BMI increased with both drugs over treatment durations of 6 months to more than 2 years, but group differences were not significant. We have low confidence in this conclusion given the few st udies addressing this outcome (low strength of evidence). Other outcomes (e.g., challenging behaviors , attention ) were not consistently addressed; thus we considered strength of evidence insufficient for all other intervention/outcome pairs. Overview of the Literature We identified 11 unique RCTs (reported in multiple publicat ions and including comparative studies identified for the current review and those reported in our 2011 review11) addressing antipsychotics15-21, 28 -39, 47 -52, 101, 102, 109, 111 -113 and one retrospective cohort that reported harms data only.122 Seven studies had low risk of bias ,15-21, 28 -39, 48 -52, 102, 112, 113 and f ive had moderate risk.47, 101, 109, 112, 113, 122 Studies included a total of 1055 children ranging in age from 2 to 20 years and were conducted in the United States (n= 5), Iran (n=2), and one each in Canada, Turkey , Italy, the Netherlands , and Indi a. Two RCTs addressed aripiprazole compared with placebo;15-21, 48 five addressed risperidone compared w ith placebo;28-39, 51, 52, 102, 109, 111 -113 and two compared risperidone and aripiprazole.49, 50 A retrospective cohort compared these agents and re ported differences in weight gain.122 One 16 RCT compared risperidone and haloperidol,101 while another compared risperidone and memantine.47 Five of these eight RCTs were also included in our 2011 review,15-21, 28 -39, 52, 109, 111 -113, 125 and investigators of four of these studies have published additional analyses of participants included in the original trials. These studies included two \"families\" of papers that report post -hoc and additional or combined analyses of participants in the initial trials. The first family of studies, conducted by Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology (RUPP) Autism Network investigators , assessed risperidone and include d an initial 8 -week t rial comparing risperidone and placebo in 101 children;34 one paper reporting potential moderator s of effect in the 8 -week trial;29one paper reporting parent concerns asses sed during the initial 8 -week trial ;35 one paper reporting social interaction measures in these participants39 and including data from a study (included in our 2011 review) that compared risperidone alone with risperidone plus parent training;126; one reporting measures of repetitive behavior38 and also including data from the risperidone plus parent training study126and one paper that reported cognitive changes in a subset of children in the original 8- week trial .30 This family also includes another paper that assessed longer term (16 weeks) effects in children who responded to risperidone in the original 8 -week trial plus children who originally received placebo and were considered placebo nonresponders but had subsequent positive response to risperidone (total n=63);36 32 of these children went on to enroll i n an RCT comparing e ither continued risperidone or risperidone with gradual placebo replac ement .31 The investigators foll owed up these reports with a paper reporting additional social interaction and stereotypy analyses of the 101 original participants in the 8- week trial and the 63 participants in the extension trial,32 analyses of weight changes in the 63 children in the extension trial,33 and analysis of adaptive behavior measures in 48 of these 63 children for whom such data were available.37 Final ly, the family includes a paper reporting longer term effects (mean 21 months) in 84 of the original 101 trial participants (38 of whom participated in the extension trial) ; among these 84 individuals, 53 continued to receive risperidone in the month befor e followup.28 Another paper reports changes in prolactin levels in these children after 8 weeks, 6 months, and roughly 22 months of risperidone treatment.111 The second fam ily of papers assessed aripiprazole and includes one 8- week trial compar ing fixed doses of aripiprazole with placebo;20 another 8- week trial comparing titrated doses of aripiprazole with placebo ;21 one paper reporting safety data in these two original trials;19 another reporting health -related quality of life measures assessed in the two original trials ;17 and another outlining Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) data in the two trials.16 The family also includes as open label extension that combined children from the ori ginal RCTs (both treatment and placebo groups) and added children who had not participated in the prior studies (de novo subjects) and in which all 330 participants received 52 weeks of aripiprazole.15 Finally, thi s family includes a paper reporting ad verse events/safety data for children in the 52- week open label extension.18 Across studies, treatment duration ranged from 8 weeks to over 2 years, with followup immediately p ost-treatment in all studies . Detailed Analysis The literature on antipsychotic effects in children with ASD reports a variety of outcomes but converges on the ABC , a rating scale completed by caregivers of individuals with ASD. Studies also typically ass essed p otential side effects or harms, including assessment of weight gain, somnolence, and gastrointestinal symptoms and used the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) rating scale. Studies of antipsychotics addressed either risperidone or aripiprazole and reported 17 significant improvements in measures of challenging behavior in the short term (<6 months) in children receiving the medications compared with those receiving placebo. Harms of these agents, including extrapyramidal symptoms and weight gain, were als o significant. Studies reporting longer term followup (up to 21 months for risperidone) reported continued effectiveness in most children but did not include control groups. We report brief summaries of outcomes reported in each study below and end of trea tment outcomes on the ABC and CGI in Tables 7- 10. Appendix F includes detailed summary tables outlining other outcomes. Studies of Risperidone The four RCTs comparing risperidone and placebo included one study (reported in multiple publications) conducte d by RUPP investigators (low risk of bias) .28-39, 112, 113 In the initial 8- week trial including 101 children,34 baseline ratings of irritability wer e similar across risperidone and placebo arms. The risperidone arm had significantly greater decreases (improvement) in ABC - Irritability scores compared with the placebo arm ( improvements of 15.1 vs. 3.6 points , p<0.001). Clinician ratings of outcomes cons idered by parents to be chief concerns paralleled these findings of significant improvement in challenging behavior in the risperidone group.35 In other sub- analyses of participants in the original 8 -week trial, AB C-Social Withdrawal scores were significantly improved in the treatment group compared with placebo (mean difference of 3.82, p=0.05, effect size: 0.42) as were scores on but scores on cognitive measures in a subset of 38 participants who were able to complete the assessments typically did not differ between groups, though no decline in cognitive skills was associated with treatment . 30, 38, 39 In another series of followup papers from this original RCT, investigators randomized responders to risperidone from the original trial and children who originally received placebo and were considered placebo nonresponders but had subse quent positive response to risperidone to either risperidone or risperidone with gradual placebo replacement for 16 weeks. 31, 36 More children in the gradual replacement arm ( n=10, in ABC -Irritability score and CGI -Improvement rating of much or very much worse compared with baseline) . In followup analyses of these participants plus children from the initial 101 in the 8 -week tria l, children receiving risperidone for up to 16 weeks had significant improvements in parent -rated measures of affect, repetitive and restricted behavior s, and sensory responses compared with children receiving placebo , but measures of social relatedness or language did not differ between groups.32 In a report of 48 children participating in the 16- week extension and receiving risperidone , scores on Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales ( VABS ) measures of communication a nd daily living skills improved significantly over the treatment period; however, this analysis lacked a control arm.37 In an extension of these analyses , investigators followed 8 4 of the initial 101 children in the 8-week trial (38 also participated in the extension trials) .28 These 84 children received risperidone for some portion of the mean 21- month uncontrolled followup; children could have received another antipsychotic or other medication, but 96 percent received risperidone over the followup period, and 68 percent were taking an antipsychotic in the month prior to followup. CGI-Severity scores improved significantly from baseline, regardless of treatment in the orig inal trial ( effect size: - 0.75) with risperidone . ABC -Irritability similarly improved significantly from baseline ( effect size - 1.01) as did the ABC -Social Withdrawal ( effect size: -0.85), ABC ABC -Hyperactiv ity size: - 1.07) , and ABC -Inappropriate Speech (-0.41) scales. Scores on the CY BOCS also improved significantly from baseline (effect 18 size: - 0.79), while scores on the VABS typically improved, but not significantly. IQ did not change significantly with risperidone . Finally, in post -hoc analyses reporting data from the original RUPP trial34 and an RUPP trial of risperidone compared with risperidone plus parent training126 (reported in detail in our 2011 review) , effect sizes on the ABC -Social withdrawal subscale were 0.65 in the risperidone only group and 0.65 in the combination group;39 scores were significantly better than those of the placebo arm in the original 8- week trial or risperidone vs. placebo.34 In another subanalysis,38 effect sizes on the CY BOCS were 0.88 in the risperidone only group and 0.86 in the combination group, both significantly improved compared with the placebo arm in the original RUPP risperidone trial. In another RCT (low risk of bias) comparing a low dose risperidone group, a high dose risperidone group, and a placebo group (total n =96) , baseline scores for ABC -Irritability and the CGI scales were similar across all groups .51, 52 The high dose risperidone arm had the greatest improvement in ABC -Irritability scores, followed by the low -dose gr oup and placebo. The difference between high dose risperidone and placebo alone was statistically significant (p<0.001) , but differences between low dose and placebo were not . The study reported s imilar improvements in CGI, with the greatest decrease in CG I scores for high dose risperidone and statistically significant differences between only the high dose group and placebo (p<0.001). In a 6-month open label extension of risperidone including 79 (56 completers) of the 96 children originally enrolled in the RCT, children received either fixed dose or flexibly dose risperidone with a median dose of 0.875mg/day in the open -label phase. All groups improved from baseline on the ABC -Irritability scale , with no significant differences between groups. Other measures taken at the end of the study included ABC -Hyperactivity, ABC -Stereotypic Behavior, ABC - Inappropriate Speech, ABC -Social Withdrawal, CYBOCS, CGI -Severity and CGI -Improvement, all of which showed improvement from baseline with no significant group differe nces. One moderate risk of bias RCT reported in the 2011 review reported statistically significant improvements on the ABC -Irritability, Stereotypy, and Hyperactivity subscales in children receiving risperidone compared with the placebo group. 112, 113 The final RCT (moderate risk of bias) assessed outcomes after 6 months of risperidone treatment using a variety of general rating scales but provided quantitative data on only some of these scales.109 The primary outcome measures were parent ratings on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and clinician ratings on the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) . The study only report ed CARS median ratings for those participan ts with at least a 20 percent response ; more children receiving risperidone achieved this goal compared with placebo ( 12 vs. 0, p<0.001) . Average ratings on the CGAS were similar in the risperidone (29.8) and placebo (32.7) arms , with more improvement in the risperidone vs. placebo arms (p=0.04) . Parent -rated scores did not differ between groups. In one discontinuation study, i nvestigators randomized children who had responded to risperidone in an initial 24- week trial to discontinuation (taper for three weeks and 5 weeks off of risperidone) or continuation for eight weeks.102 For the primary outcome measure of relapse, 8 of 12 patients relapsed in the placebo group and 3 of 12 patients relapsed in the risperidone group (p=0.49). ABC -Irritably scores increased by 60 percent in t he placebo group 14 percent in the risperidone group (p = 0.43). Differences in other ABC scales (Social Withdrawal, Stereotypy, Hyperactivity and Inappropriate Speech ) were not statistically significant. Table 7 outlines key outcomes. 19 Table 7.

Decreases in ABC -Irritability were significantly greater for the aripiprazole arms in both studies, with improvements of 12.4 t o14.4, in comparison with the placebo arms, with improvements of 5.0 to 8.4. The trial with differing set doses of aripiprazole demonstrated increasing response with increasing dose.20 Overall, the results of the trial that used titration following clinical judgment were more pronounced.21 Decreases (improvements) in ABC -Hyperactivity and Stereotypy subscales were significantly greater in children receiving aripipra zole compared with placebo arms . Scores in the ABC -Inappropriate Speech subscale were also significantly improved in the treatment group vs. placebo in the flexibly dosed study but not in the fixed dose RCT. Both studies also used the CY BOCS scale to asses s repetitive behavior, finding no baseline differences between the groups but a greater decrease in the aripiprazole compared with placebo arms (2.4 to 3.8 vs. 0.8 to 1.7). A number of other outcomes were measured in these two studies, but none outside of challenging behavior and repetitive behavior yielded statistically significant findings once corrected for multiple comparisons. Post-hoc analyses of these RCTs analyzed changes in ABC scores 16 and quality of lif e measures.17 The first post -hoc analysis16 analyzed the following changes in AB C subscales. Scores on the ABC -Irritability, Stereotypy, Hyperactivity, and Inappropriate Speech subscales were significantly improved in the aripiprazole arms compared with placebo (all p values <0.05) , typically with greater decreases in the flexibly dosed group compared with the fixed dose group. Scores on the Social Withdrawal subscale did not differ significantly between treatment and placebo groups. Compared with placebo, the pooled aripiprazole groups had greater improvements in total health -related quality of life scores and em otional, social, and cognitive functioning scores measured using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (all p values < 0.05).17 Children who received aripiprazole were also more likely to have clinically meaningful improvement on all these scales compared with those receiving placebo (odds ratios ranging from 1.2 to 2.2, p values <0.05). Investigators extended these 8- week studies with an uncontrolled, 52- week open label analys is including 70 children who had received placebo in the original RCTs, 174 who had received aripip razole, and 86 \"de novo\" subjects. 15 Primary outcomes included the ABC - Irritability and CGI -Severity scales . ABC -Irritability mean scores at baseline were higher for the 24 de novo (23.2\u00b1 8.9) and prior placebo (21.5\u00b1 9.8) groups compared with the prior aripiprazole group (15.0\u00b1 9.2). Mean change from baseline in the de novo group was - 8.0 \u00b1 - 10.1 and in the prior placebo group was -6.1 \u00b1 11.9. Improvements in scores in the de novo and prior aripiprazole groups occurred i n first 8 weeks of the open label phase. The CGI decreased in the same manner, with greater reductions (improvements ) in the de novo and prior placebo groups than in the prior aripiprazole group, in which i mprovements reported in the prior RCTs were mainta ined. Scores in the ABC -Hyperactivity subscale and CYBOCS followed similar patterns . An additional low risk of bias RCT randomized 85 children who had shown a stable improvement ( 25% decrease in ABC -Irritability scores for 12 weeks) in an initial 13- 26 week open label phase to continue d, flexibly dosed aripiprazole or placebo until relapse (defined as 25% increase in ABC -Irritability score, CGI ratings of worse or much worse, loss -to-followup plus elevated scores, elevated scores plus initiation of oth er medication to treat symptoms, or discontinuation due to worsening symptoms) or 16 weeks.48 The difference between the two groups in time to relapse was not statistically significant (35% in the aripiprazole arm at 16 weeks vs. 52% in placebo, hazard ratio=0.57, 95% confidence interval [ CI]: 0.28 to 1.12, number needed to treat =6). Mean change in the ABC -Irritability and Social Withdrawal scores or CGI - Improvement score from baseline to week 16 did not differ betw een groups (p 0.05) , but children in the placebo group had greater increases (i.e., worsening behavior) on the ABC - Hyperactivity and Inappropriate Speech subscales than did children in the treatment group (p values <0.05) ; pediatric quality of life measures also did not differ between groups. 25 Table 8.

In one 24- week RCT (low 29 risk of bias) comparing two groups of patients with ASD and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) , both groups improved on measures of symptom severity including the ADHD Rating Scale and CGI (all p=NS) Of note, improvement with aripiprazole was evident in the first 12 weeks of treatment without additional improvements at 24 weeks , while scores on measures in children taking risperidone improved at 12 weeks and continued to improve over the 24 week period.50 Another 8-week RCT (low risk of bias) reported improvements in ABC -Irritability, Hyperacti vity, Lethargy, Stereotypy, and Inappropriate speech scores in both risperidone and aripiprazole arms.49 Most patients were much or minimally improved on the CGI -Improvement scale, but differences between the group s on all of these scales were not statistically significant. Another retrospective cohort study (moderate risk of bias), which primarily reports weight change (see Harms section below), noted no significant group differences in mean CGI - Improvement scores (risperidone= 3.2\u00b11.2, aripiprazole=2.9\u00b1 1.2, p=0.32) after treatment years) or aripiprazole ( mean treatment duration=1.47\u00b1 1.21 years) .122 The study did not report CGI scores at baseline so the magnitude of change cannot be assessed.

In o ne small RCT (moderate risk of bias) compar ing risperidone with haloperidol, both groups improved from baseline on the Ritvo -Freeman scale, ABC, and Turgay DSM -IV Pervasive Development Disorder scale, with significantly greater improvements in the risperidone group on the ABC and Turgay scales (p values <0.01).101 Appendix F outl ines key data from this study. Memantine. In one small RCT (moderate risk of bias) comparing risperidone with memantine, children in both groups improved significantly from baseline on all ABC subscales except stereotypy and on most CARS subscales (no im provements in either group in fear/nervousness, nonverbal communication, and intellectual response. Improvements in memantine arm on taste, smell, touch response and imitation), but differences between groups were not significant . 47 CGI ratings were not significantly different between groups. Appendix F outlines key data fr om this study. 31 Harms of Antipsychotics Risperidone. Table 10 outlines harms reported in study arms addressing risperidone . Among clinically important harms, appetite increase occurred in over 70 percent of children and extrapyramidal symptoms in 36 perce nt. Gastrointestinal symptoms (including constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal pain) occurred in nearly all children in the 8 week RCT , and more than 25 percent across phases experienced anxiety and hypersalivation. Across studies, six children withdrew due to adverse events. Some studies reported comparative analyses of harms data: In the RUPP extension study urinary problems occurred in 19.6 percent of patients who took risperidone, and 0% of patients that did not (p=0.01) . Excessive appetite occurred in 42.1 percent of patients who took risperidone and 20 percent of those who did not (p=ns). In another RCT comparing risperidone doses and placebo, t he incidence of treatment- emergent adverse events was higher in the high dose group compared with the low dose group and placebo. 125, 127 In combining high and low dose groups, the most common events included increased appetite (26%), sedation (15%), somnolence (11%) and weight increase (11%). Sedation, somnolence and increased appetite occurred with twice the frequency in the high dose group than in the low dose group. In an analysis of prolactin changes in children participating in the RUPP trial, serum prolactin increased significantly from baseline in children taking risperidone at 8 weeks and 6 months, though concentrations were lower at 6 months than at weeks. 111 Levels were higher in treated children compared with those in the placebo group. In the 20 treated children with measurements at 8 weeks, 6 months, and ~22 months, levels were significantly elevated at each time point compared with baseline , but levels at 22 months were significantly lower than those at 6 months (p=0.016). While these elevations represented 2 to 4 f old increases in prolactin, no children reported clinical complaints such as galactorrhea, gynecomastia, or menstrual changes . Another study reported no significant differences in weight change between risperidone and placebo groups (increase of 17% in the risperidone group and 9.3% in placebo).109 One analysis of side effects in a discontinuation study102 reported adverse events that occurred in at least 10 percent of pat ients taking risperidone, including increased a ppetite (mild - 49%, 8%), nxiety sea (10%) and drooling (10%). The authors did not report differences in groups during the discontinuation period. 32 Table 10.

Table 12 outline s harms reported in study arms addressing aripiprazole. Harms reported across studies included weight gain, appetite changes, lethargy, and extrapyramidal 34 symptoms. Across studies 34 children withdrew due to adverse events. Some studies reported comparativ e analyses of harms data: in an analysis of harms reported in two 8 -week trials20, 21 of aripiprazole vs. placebo, the percentage of patients who discontinued due to at least adverse event with aripiprazole was 10.4 percent compared with 6.9 percent in the placebo groups.19 The most common adverse events reported in the aripiprazole groups compared with placebo were: sedation (10.4% tremor (9.9% vs. 0.0%). Younger children (6-12 years) had a higher group rate of salivary hypersecretion in the aripiprazole group (6.6% vs 0% in the placebo group), but older children (13-17 years) did not. The majority of adverse events had a peak incidence of onset at week 1 or 2, except for nasopharyngitis and tremor , which had a peak incidence at week 3, extrapyramidal disorder and aggressi on at week 4, drooling at week 5, diarrhea at weeks 2 and 5, enuresis and upper respiratory tract infection at week 6 and cough at week 7. Investigators rated m ost adverse events as mild or moderate. Most of the adverse events rated as severe were in the y ounger (6- 12 years ) subgroup, with one event of severe fatigue in the 13 -17 age group. Fatigue was the only adverse event that showed a statistically significant dose -response relationship, with 3.8 percent reporting fatigue at 5mg/d, 22 percent at 10mg/d and 18.5 percent at 15mg/ d. The adjusted mean change (last observation carried forward) in body weight was higher in the aripiprazole group (1.6 kg) than the placebo group (0.4 kg) ( p<0.001) . The median change in BMI (0.7 vs. 0.2 kg/m2) was also higher in the aripiprazole group than the placebo group. Extrapyramidal -related adverse events were also more frequent in the aripiprazole group (20.8% vs. 9.9% ). The most common extrapyramidal -related adverse events were tremor (9.9% vs 0% in placebo) and extrapyramidal disorder (6.1% vs 0% in placebo). In the 52 -week open label extension of these trials, 286 of 330 patients (86.7%) reported adverse events. 18 Discontinuations were significant in the three groups: 36 percent of de novo patients discontinued, 47.1 percent of prior placebo patients discontinued, and 38.5 percent of prior aripiprazole patients discontinued. Common reasons for discontinuation were adverse events, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow up and lack of efficacy. The most common adverse events reported from the three groups combined were weight increased (23%), vomiting (18.8%), nasopharyngitis (13.3% ), ear infection, nasal congestion, sinusitis, and constipation were also reported in >5% of patients. In another RC T, 56.4 percent of children in t he aripiprazole group reported a treatment - emergent adverse event compared with 32.6 percent of the placebo group. Adverse events reported by at least 5 percent of participants and at least twice the rate of placebo included upper respiratory tract infections (10.3% for aripiprazole vs. 2.3% for placebo), constipation (5.1% for aripiprazole vs. 0% for placebo), and movement for aripiprazole vs. 0% for placebo , p=NR ). Weight change was 0.15 standard deviations greater in the aripiprazole group compared with placebo (mean gain of 2.2kg vs. 0.6kg , p=0.001 ). Fasting metabolic measurements were not different between groups, but the mean change in prolactin showed a difference of - 4.8 (95% CI: - 6.8 to - 2.9; - 0.2ng/ml for aripiprazole and 4.6ng/ml for placebo). 48 35 Table 12.

EPS = extrapyramidal symptoms ; N = number Risperidone Vers us Aripiprazole. In one RCT the three most common side effects in both groups were increased appetite, weight gain and drowsiness.50 Differences in changes in height, weight gain, BMI and blood glucose between the two groups were not statistically significant, while prolactin increased in the risperidone arm compared with aripiprazole (mean increase from 167.5\u00b1 80 to 464\u00b1 190 in the risperidone group, mean decrease from 158.2\u00b1 70.2 to 127.5\u00b1 75.1 in the aripiprazole group, p<0.001). One retrospective cohort study compared these agents in 142 children, all of whom were relatively overweight at baseline (BMI Z scores of 0.67\u00b1 1.44 in children receiving risperidone and 0.64\u00b1 1.94 in those receiving aripiprazole, p=ns) .122 Children taking aripiprazole were older than those taking risperidone at baseline ( 9.74\u00b1 3.46 years vs. 8.41\u00b1 3.59, p=0.03), and children risperidone had a longer (2.37\u00b1 2.55 vs. 1.47\u00b1 1.21 years , p=0.01) . Other demographic characteristics and use of concomitant medications did not differ significantly between groups. Both groups gained weight over time (significant increases in BMI and BMI Z -scores in each group) , with no significant group differences in BMI change per year of treatment (2.36\u00b1 3.80 in risperidone group vs. 2.05\u00b1 5.02 for aripiprazole, p=0.68) or 0.56\u00b1 2.21 for Investigators note that the study was underpowered to detect differences in Z -scores. In another RCT, four children withdrew from the study because of adverse events.49 Risperidone Versus Haloperidol . Alanine was increased in the haloperidol group and decreased in the risperidone group (p=0.04) and prolactin increased more in the risperidone group vs. the haloperidol group (p=0.01). Both groups experienced w eight gain (risperidone increase from 33.3kg \u00b1 9.1 and upper respiratory tract infections. 37 Studies of Medications Used To Treat ADHD Key Points Both RCTs addressing methylphenidate reported significant improvements in hyperactivity in children treated with medium to high doses compared with placebo. One RCT also noted significant treatment effects on inattention. Harms were frequent and included challenging behavior, anxiety, and appetite changes. Methylphenidate improved hype ractivity vs. placebo and was associated with clinically significant harms . Our confidence in the se conclusions is low as studies were small and short term (low strength of evidence). Data were inadequate to assess effects on social communication and oppos itional behavior (insufficient strength of evidence). Studies of atomoxetine compared with placebo reported promising findings related to improvements in hyperactivity in c hildren with ASD and ADHD with clinically moderate adverse effects. We found positi ve effects of atomoxetine compared with placebo on hyperactivity in children with ASD and ADHD and moderate harms . Our confidence in these conclusions is low (low strength of evidence). Data were inadequate to assess effects on inattention as studies repor ted inconsistent findings ( insufficient strength of evidence). One RCT of guanfacine reported significant improvements in hyperactivity in treated participants compared with the placebo group and no significant group differences in measures of cognitive s kills. Harms included drowsiness and fatigue. Data were inadequate to assess effects of guanfacine given the small sample size and short- term assessment in one RCT (insufficient strength of evidence). Overview of the Literature We identified five RCTs ( reported in multiple publications) addressing medications for ADHD.24-27, 40 -46 Two RCTs addressed methylphenidate 24-27, 45 One study, conducted by the RUPP network, was i ncluded in our 2011 review .24-27 Two RCTs assessed atomoxetine.40-44 We describe effectiveness outcomes reported in another RCT comparing atomoxetine with and without parent training and placebo with and without parent training54, 55 in the section on Studies Addressing Combined Medical and Behavioral Treatments but report harms data from this study with other atomoxetine studies . Finally, one RCT evaluated guanfacine,46 Studies included a total of 265 children between the ages of 5 and 17. Four RCTs had low risk of bias , 24-27, 41 -45 and one had mode rate.40Studies were conducted in the United States24-27, 40, 45, 46 Treatment duration ranged from 4 to 28 weeks, with one trial including a 4 -week randomized phase and an 8- week open label continuation phase24-27 and another including 8 weeks of treatment followed by a 20 -week open label phase.41-44 Detailed Analysis Studies of methylpheni date, atomoxetine , and guanfacine reported improvements in hyperactivity and other challenging behaviors with treatment compared with placebo (Table 14) . Side effects were associated with all agents , including aggressive behavior and appetite changes (meth ylphenidate ); irritability and gastrointestinal double -blind cross -over trial of methylphenidate compared a one -day placebo foll owed by two days at each of three (low, medium, high) test doses of methylphenidate ;25-27 doses ranged from 7.5 mg/day to 50.0 mg/day. Children tolerating methylphenidate (n=66) moved on to a 4- week, double -blind c rossover phase. Children with a positive response in the double blind phase (n=34) completed an 8- week open- label continuation phase at their best dose. The primary outcome measure was hyperactivity as assessed by the ABC teacher -rated hyperactivity subsca le; secondary measures included the ABC parent -rated hyperactivity subscale. Blinded clinicians also assessed participants us ing the Clinical Global Impression ( CGI)-Irritability scale; investigators combined this subscale and the ABC parent and teacher ra ted hyperactivity subscales to assess response (Table 14) . In the double -blind crossover phase, all methylphenidate doses demonstrated effects that were statistically superior to placebo, and effect sizes favored the medium dose for parent ratings and hi gh dose for teacher ratings. Parent -rated lethargy/ social withdrawal significantly worsened during the high dose of methylphenidate compared with placebo. P arent -rated stereotypy and inappropriate speech scores improved significantly at the medium dose of methylphenidate compared with placebo. Hyperactivity/impulsivity also improved more with the medium and high methylphenidate dose s than at the low dose . Significantly more joint attention behaviors occurred in the intervention group both at the best methy lphenidate dose and at the low dose compared with placebo. Self-regulation, as assessed in a \"competing demands\" task , improved in low dose as well as in medium dose methylphenidate compared with placebo, and neutral affect significantly increased at the m edium and high dose, which could be either beneficial, in the case of children with a labile mood, or damaging, in the case of children with flattened affect due to a medication side effect. 25-27 In another 4-week RCT comparing extended release methylphenidate and placebo in ch ildren with ASD and significant ADHD symptoms with higher IQs (mean=85\u00b116.8) , children in the treatment group received extended release methylphenidate (low, medium, or high doses ) in the morning and immediate release methylphenidate in the afternoon.45 Parent -rated measures of attention, ASD symptoms, hyperactivity and impulsivity improved significantly more at higher doses compared with lower doses and with placebo, and teachers reported significant improvements in hyperactivity , inattention and impulsivity at higher doses compared with lower doses and with placebo. Teachers (but not parents) also reported significant improvements in oppositional behavior with high dose methylphenidate compared with placebo. Neither teachers nor parents reported significant group differences in measures of emotional lability or social communication . Clinician -rated severity was significantly improved at all methylphen idate doses compared with placebo. Atomoxetine. Two RCTs of atomoxetine reported significant treatment- related improvements compared with placebo that were maintained over 20 weeks of open label, uncontrolled treatment in one study; inattention was significantly improved in one study, and side effects were generally moderate (Table 1 6). In one low risk of bias RCT ( reported in multiple publications ), the initial study phase included participants with ASD and ADHD and compared atomoxetine with placebo. 41-44 After 8 weeks of treatment, the atomoxetine group improved significantly more on the clinician -rated ADHD Rating Scale total score and on the inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity subscales (p values 0.003). Nine of 48 treatment group participants and 4/49 placebo group were considered very much or much improved in the CGI -ADHD- I 39 (p=ns). Scores on only the hyperactivity subscale of the Conners Teacher Rating Scale were significantly different between groups (difference in least square means: - 2.0 [95% CI: - 3.7 to - 0.3], p=0.02). Children in the atomoxetine arm also had greater improvements on the ABC Hyperactivity, Inappropriate Speech, and Stereotypic Behavior (but not other subscales) than did children receiving placebo (p values <0.05, effect sizes of 0.4 to 0.6). Scores on the Children's Social Behavior Questionnaire did not differ between groups. Response inhibition (as measured using a go -no go task) improved significantly in the atomoxetine group versus placebo but distractibility did not. 41 In a 20-week open label extension including 88 children from the 8- week study (42 from the treatment group and 46 from placebo), overall scores on the ADHD Rating Scale improved from the 8 -week baseline to the 28 week followup ( p=0.015) ; changes on the inattention subscale significant . An earlier 6 -week crossover RCT (moderate risk of bias) including children with ASD and ADHD reported significant improvements in hyperactivity associated with atomoxetine compared with plac ebo (effect size=0.90, p=0.04), but changes in inattention measures were not significantly different between groups. 40 Investigators considered seven children (43%) to be responders to atomoxetine (25% improvement in ABC -Hyperactivity scale and CGI rating of very much improved or improved). Table 14 outlines outcomes. Guanfacine. One RCT evaluating extended release guanfacine included mostly males with ASD and hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and distractibility and reported significant improvements in hyperactivity (effect size=1.67, p<0.001) in the treated group compared with placebo. 46 Cognitive tests of working memory did not differ between groups (Table 14) . 40 Table 14.

Methylphenidate was associated with changes in appetite and challenging and repetitive behavior at all doses (rates ranging from 5% to 50%) and with anx iety and insomnia (at lower doses). Five (out of 24) children discontinued an afternoon dose of medication because of irritability in one study,45 and 13 of 72 discontinued a second RCT due to irritability (n=6) or other adverse effects.24-27 Table 15 outlines harms. 45 Table 15. Harms/ adverse effects in studies of methylphenidate Harm /Adverse Eventa N Studies Reporting Harm (# Participants With Harm/Total Participants ) Reported Rates Across -8% aHarms more than one participant. EPS = extrapyramidal symptoms; N = number 46 Atomoxetine. During the 8- week treatment versus placebo phase in one RCT, 81.3 percent of children receiving atomoxetine compared with 65.3 percent of placebo participants reported at least one adverse event (p=ns) in one study ; one child in the atomoxetine group discontinued due to fatigue.41-44 Significantly more treatment than placebo participants reported nausea (14 vs. 4), decreased appetite (13 vs. 3), fatigue (11 vs. 3), and early morning awakening (5 vs. 0, all p values <0.05). In the open- label extension phase, 11 of 88 participants withdrew from the study due to adverse effects. Adverse effects occurring in more than 10 percent of participants in the first 8 weeks of treatment included upper abdominal pain (12.5%), decreased appeti te (18.2%), fatigue (18.2%), headache (20.5%), and nausea (13.6%). Most harms attenuated over time: during the open label phase, only headache continued to occur in more than 10 percent of participants (14.8%). In another RCT, more children in the atomoxet ine group had gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, and racing heart rate (p values <0.05) than did children in the placebo group. 40Four children receiving placebo had severe adverse events including restlessness, mo od swings, decreased appetite; among those receiving atomoxetine severe events included rage requiring hospitalization in one child (leading to study withdrawal) and tiredness in another. In an RCT comparing atomoxetine plus parent training with atomoxetine alone, placebo, and placebo plus parent training (see effectiveness outcomes reported in the section on Combination Medical and Behavioral Treatment), abdominal pain and decreased appetite occurred more frequently in the atomoxetine groups than in place bo groups ( p values 0.07) as did greater issues with sleep onset (p=NS). One child in the atomoxetine group who received levetiracetam for seizures was hospitalized for a seizure, but investigators did not consider the event related to atomoxetine. Fiftee n participants withdrew from the study due to adverse events, five of whom were receiving atomoxetine (8% of children receiving active medication). Table 1 6 outlines harms. Table 16.

Guanfacine was fairly well tolerated: four children withdrew from the trial (2 for adverse events and 2 for lack of efficacy), and one child had severe aggressive behavior that resulted in patient psychiatric hospitalization.

Heart rate and blood pressure decreased in treated patients with attenuation over time. Table 17 outlines harms. 48 Table 17.

EPS = extrapyramidal symptoms ; mg = milligrams ; n = number 49 Studies of Combined Medical and Behavioral Treatments Key Points Atomoxetine plus parent training or atomoxetine alone were both associated with improvements in ADHD, inattention, hyperactivity, noncompliance, and overall symptom severity compared with placebo, with improvements maint ained over 24 weeks for most treatment responders. Differences between atomoxetine groups were not statistically significant for any outcome. Melatonin and melatonin plus cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) both improved sleep- related outcomes. Folic acid plus Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) treatment and folic acid alone both improved behaviors, with no statistically significant group differences. Bumetanide plus applied behavior analysis improv ed symptom severity and behavior more than applied behavior analysis alone. Stem cell transplantation plus rehabilitation therapy improved symptom severity, lethargy, and stereotypy more than umbilical cord blood cell transplant plus r ehabilitation therap y or rehabilitation therapy alone . Given that combination therapies were investigated in single studies, we could not make conclusions about their effects on any outcomes (insufficient strength of evidence). Overview of the Literature Three RCTs54-57 and two nonrandomized trials120, 121 evaluated different medical treatments in combination with behavioral compared with another treatment or placebo. Studies had low,54, 55, 57 moderate,121 and high risk of bias56, 120 and included a total of 419 children (median=66/study) ranging in age from 3 to 14 yea rs. One RCT comparing risperidone plus parent training with risperidone alone was included in our 2011 review but not in the present medical treatment update as it evaluates the effect of parent training;126 howeve r, it is one of the few studies to compare a combination medical and behavioral treatment. Detailed Analysis Atomoxetine. A 10- week trial with a 24 -week extension randomized children with ASD and ADHD symptoms to one of 4 arms: atomoxetine, atomoxetine pl us parent training, placebo, or placebo plus parent training.54, 55 Families assigned to parent training received nine 60- 90 minute training sessions addressing preventing behavior problems and behavioral reinforce ment. After 10 weeks of treatment over 45 percent of children in each of the atomoxetine groups met the definition of response (>30% decrease [improvement] on measures of ADHD and symptom severity) compared with 29 percent in the placebo plus parent traini ng group and 19 percent in the placebo group (p=0.015 for atomoxetine vs. placebo). More children in the atomoxetine groups improved on measures of noncom pliance but differences compared with the placebo group were not statistically significant. Parent rat ings of inattention, hyperactivity, and ADHD were significantly improved in active treatment groups compared with placebo alone ( p values 0.05) ; teacher ratings improved in all groups from baseline to followup but group differences were not significant. Both parents and teachers rated children in the atomoxetine groups as significantly improved compared with the placebo group on noncompliance (Home Situations 50 Questionnaire) (p values 0.05) . Parents also rated children in the placebo plus parent training group as significantly improved on the ABC -Hyperactivity and Inappropriate S peech scales compared with placebo alone (p values 0.05). Differences between the atomoxetine plus parent training and atomoxetine alone groups were not statistically significant for any outcomes. After 10 weeks of treatment, 117 of the 128 children in the 10- week trial entered a 24 -week extension. A tomoxetine respo nders and nonresponder s who originally been assigned to a placebo group continued or began atomoxetine and maintained parent training if originally assigned to it in the 10- week trial. At followup, analyses of the effects of parent training vs. no parent t raining showed no significant group differences on measures of symptom severity, ADHD, inattention, hyperactivity, and parent -rated irritability and hyperactivity, though improvements were typically greater with parent training. Twenty -six of 40 children ( 60%) who were responders to atomoxetine maintained response; 37 percent of placebo nonresponders had favorable ADHD outcomes and 34 percent had favorable noncompliance outcomes . Harms reported in this study are described in Table 16 . Melatonin. One 12- week RCT with low risk of bias compared cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT ) alone, melatonin alone, CBT plus melatonin, and placebo in 160 children. 57 CBT consisted of four 50- minute sessions focused on recognizing dy sfunctional attitudes about sleep, parent -management of children's sleep, and replacing poor sleep habits with appropriate behavior. All active treatment groups improved in most measures of sleep quality compared with the control group (p< 0.01). In general , the combination group improved more than the others, followed by melatonin , and CBT. Scores for children who received melatonin alone improved on bedtime resistance, sleep onset delay, sleep duration, and night waking compared with the CBT group (p< 0.001). Effect sizes ranged from medium to high. Sleep onset latency (time to fall asleep) and sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time in bed) were reduced by 50 percent (sleep latency) or 85 percent (efficiency) in 85 and 63 percent of childr en in the combination group and 39 and 46 percent of children in the melatonin group, respectively. In the CBT arm, 10 percent of children met each criterion, and no children in the control arm achieved these percentages of reduced latency or improved effi ciency. Folic A cid. One 12- week nonrandomized trial (moderate risk of bias) compared folic acid supplementation plus the TEACCH program to the TEACCH program alone and reported no statistically significant differences between groups on measures of challenging behavior, symptom severity, and teacher -rated communication, though both groups typically improved from baseline. 121 Bumetanide. In a high risk of bias, 12- week RCT comparing bumetanide plus daily applied behavior analysis and applied behavior analysis alone, children in the combination arm had significantly improved ABC, CARS, and CGI scores (p values <0.05). 56 Stem C ell T ransplantation. In one 24- week nonrandomize d trial (high risk of bias) including 37 children received either rehabilitation therapy plus umbilical cord blood cell transplant, rehabilitation therapy plus stem cell transplant (4 intravenous or intrathecal transplants at 5 -7 day intervals), or rehabil itation therapy alone. 120 All children also received sensory integration and behavioral treatment. Symptom severity improved over time in all groups, with significantly greater improvements in the stem cell group c ompared with each of the other arms (p<0.05). CGI 51 and total ABC scores also improved more in the stem cell group compared with the other groups. Lethargy/social withdrawal and stereotypy scales improved significantly more in the stem cell group compared wi th the other arms (p<0.05), but scores on the other individual ABC scales did not differ significantly. Studies of Nutritional Supplements or Specialized Diets Key Points Four RCTs compared omega -3 fatty acid supplementation and placebo and three addressi ng the outcome reported no significant effects on challenging behaviors. Our confidence in this conclusion is low (low strength of evidence for no effect ). We also have low confidence in the conclusion that omega -3 supplementation was associated with minimal harms (low strength of evidence). Despite the number of RCTs with low or moderate risk of bias addressing other agents, evidence was inadequate to make conclusions about all clinical efficacy and harms outcomes because few, small, underpowered studies address ed each diet or supplement (insufficient strength of evidence) . While seven studies addressed variations of the gluten -free casein -free ( GFCF ) diet, studies addressed different outcomes and different approaches to restricted and control diets ; thus , data were inadequate to make conclusions about the body of evidence (insufficient strength of evidence). Data were inadequate to allow conclusions about the relative effectiveness of the other dietary interventions ( e.g., camels' milk, gluten - or casein -containing challenge foods) compared with placebo (insufficient strength of evidence) . Overview of the Literature We identified 19 RCTs (three reported in multiple publications)58-65, 80 -88, 104-107, 117, 128 that evaluated the use of supplements or dietary manipulation to treat ASD symptoms . Two of these studies117, 128 were included in our 2011 review. Studies addressed nutritional supplements inclu ding omega -3 long- chain free fatty acid (FFA) supplementation ,80-82, 84 methyl digestive enzyme s,85, 117 and L-carnitine .86, 88 Dietary interventions addressed in studies included GFCF diet s,58, 62 -65, 104 -107 gluten/casein challenge foods ,59, 60 and camel s' milk.61 Studies were conducted in the United States,58, 60, 63, 80 -83, 87, 88, 106, 107, Saudi Arabia.61 Study treatment durations ranged from 7 days to 2 years , and sample sizes ranged from 1 2 to 92 (total N=732). Followup occurred immediately post -treatment in all studies. Fo ur RCTs had low risk of bias,58, 60, 81, 83 10 had moderate,59, 63, 80, 82, 84 -87, 106, 107, 117, 128 and five had high risk.61, 62 , 64, 65, 88, 104, 105 Detailed Analysis Despite the number of RCTs with low or moderate risk of bias addressing supplements or diets , evidence is insufficient to determine their effects on any outcome in the short - or long - term. Most studies were small (median 30 total participants ), short -term (ranging from 1 week to 7 months, with 24 months of treatment in one study) . We provide brief summaries of reported outcomes by agent below. Appendix F includes summary tables with detailed findings. 52 Studies of N utritional Supplements Free Fatty Acid (Omega- 3) Supplementation Little evidence supports the effectiveness of FFA supplementation to improve core or associated ASD symptoms (Table 18) . Three RCTs of omega -3 FFA versus placebo (low81 and moderate80, 84 risk of bias) reported no significant group differences on most measures of challenging behavior, communication, language , and adaptive behavior including the ABC, CGI, Peabod y Picture Vocabulary Test, Pervasive Development Disorder Behavioral Inventory (PDD - BI), VABS, Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC), and Social Responsiveness Scale.80, 81, 84 One study reported significa ntly improved scores in the placebo group compared with the omega -3 group on the BASC externalizing problems scale after 6 months of treatment,84 and another reported significant improvement in parent ratings of st ereotypy and lethargy in children receiving omega -3 supplements compared with those receiving placebo, but teacher ratings were not significantly different.80 Another moderate risk of bias RCT of dietary docosahex anoic acid (DHA) supplementation versus placebo reported improvement in parent -rated social skills on the BASC in children receiving placebo vs. those receiving DHA , while teachers rated communication as more improved in the treatment group compared with placebo .82 Scores on other measures including the CGI, ABC, and Child Development Inventory did not differ significantly between groups.

Two RCTs with moderate risk of bias addressed digestive enzyme supplements compared with placebo : one evaluated a proteolytic enzyme supplement (Peptizyde )117 and the other a digestive enzyme supplement (Neo-Digestin ).85 The Peptizyde RCT reported no significant differences in measures of behavior, sleep quality, or gastrointestinal symptoms , and no significant differences in adverse effects.117 In a 3 -month tr ial of Neo -Digestin versus placebo , CARS scores improved significantly in the treatment group compared with placebo.85 Other Supplements Two RCTs with low83 and moderate87 risk of bia s addressed methyl B12 supplementation. CGI scores improved significantly in the methyl B12 group in one RCT (effect size=0.84, p=0.005) , but studies reported few other significant group differences in measures of behavior or communication .87 In two RCTs addressing L -carnitine (moderate86 and high88 risk of bias) , ASD severity scores improved significantly in the L-Carnitine group compared with placebo in one , but scores on other behavioral measures or measures of adverse effect s did not differ between groups.88 In the second RCT, symptom severity did not differ between groups after 6 months of treatment.86 Studies of Dietary Manipulation Gluten -Free Casein Data to assess effects of GFCF diets are limited as dietary approaches and outcome measures varied among studies as did control diets and monitoring of adherence to GFCF diets . Four RCTs (in multiple publications) compared GFCF diets to either an unaltered diet ,64, 65, 104 -107 or a low sugar diet (Total N across studies=82) .63One 12- week RCT (moderate risk of bias) reported no significant differe nces between groups on measures of development or behavior (Mullen Scales of Early Learning, Child Behavior Checklist) , though the control group improved significantly from baseline on visual reception, withdrawal, aggression, and attention subscales (p va lues <0.05) Another 12 -week crossover RCT (moderate risk of bias) similarly reported no significant differences between groups on measures of symptom severity or language , though parents of 7 of the 15 children participating in the study reported improveme nts in language.106, 107 In a retrospective analysis of videotapes recorded during the study period, investigators found no significant group differences in verbal communication between children in the diet or cont rol 55 groups or between children whose parents reported language improvements after the study period and those whose parents did not. A 12-month RCT (high risk of bias) in cluding children with urinary peptide abnormalities reported significant improvements( unblinded parent -rated questions from the Diagnosis of Psychotic Behavior in Children questionnaire) in communication , resistance to communication, social isolation, repetitive or challenging behavior, and overall impairment in children on a GFCF diet comp ared with those on a usual diet (p values 0.007) .104, 105 Children in the GFCF diet also improved significantly on tests of cognitive skills, motor skills, verbal and social communication, anxiety, and reaction to changes in environment and routine compared with control children (p values <0.05) . Another high risk of bias RCT with 24- month followup of participants reported few differences in behavioral measures between children on a GFCF diet and those with no diet ary restrictions; 64, 65 scores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and Gilliam Autism Rating Scale improved significantly in participants in the GFCF group vs. no diet group at 12 months, but score s were not different on any measure in a subset of participants followed for 24 months. Gluten -Free Diets One 6- week, high risk of bias RCT compared a gluten- free diet to a usual diet and reported significant improvements in gastrointestinal symptoms (sto machache, bloating, constipation) from baseline in the gluten -free diet group but not in the control group. Diarrhea did not improve significantly in either group. Stereotyped behavior, communication, social interaction, and ASD symptoms also improved from baseline in the gluten -free group (p values <0.02) but not in the control arm; differences in stereotyped behaviors and communication, but not social interaction, were significant between groups (p values 0.005) . The study did not report other between -group comparisons. Gluten -Free and Dairy -Free Diets In a small, low risk of bias trial comparing a gluten and dairy free diet with a diet including both gluten and dairy , scores on measures of challenging behavior (hyperactivity, irritability, inattention) did not differ between groups after 4 weeks of therapy. 58 Children in both groups had gastrointestinal symptoms (loose or hard stools, abdominal pain, p=NR). Gluten and Casein Challenge Foods or Supplementation Two small RCTs (low129 and moderate59 risk of bias) evaluated \"challenges\" of gluten or casein containing foods , but evidence is inadequate to determine if short -term gluten - casein containing foods affect ASD symptoms or gastrointestinal function . One RC T randomized children who were GFCF diets to foods with gluten, gluten and casein, or placebo foods.60 The study reported no significant group differences in mea sures of challenging behavior s or measure s of sleep quality and stool frequency at any time point over the 30- week trial. Another RC T assessing effects of introducing gluten -casein containing foods versus placebo foods similarly reported no significant eff ects of added gluten or casein on behavior or gastrointestinal symptoms.59 Camel Milk A single RCT (high ris k of bias) compared boiled or raw camel's milk with cow's milk and reported no significant differences in ASD severity between groups after 2 weeks of treatment .61 56 Harms of Nutritional or Dietary Interventions Studies that reported harms either reported no significant difference between the intervention group and the control group, or reported zero harms for each group. Appendix F includes detailed harms tables. Studies of Risperidone Adjuncts Key Points Though 14 RCTs with low or moderate risk of bias compared risperidone plus an adjunct medication with risperidone plus placebo, few compared the same adjunct agents . Studies thus provide little evidence to inform treatment decisions and can be considered primarily as pilot efficacy trials. Most studies reported improvements in irritability with combined treatment compared with placebo plus risperidone, but data were inadequate to assess effects for all comparisons and outcomes given the heterogeneity of agents (insufficient strength of evidence) . Overview of the Literature We identified 14 placebo -controlled RCTs addressing risperidone plus an adjunct medication (titrated to 0.5 to 3 mg/day based on body weight) .89-100, 118, 124 Two of these studies were included in our 2011 review .118, 124 Study medications added to risperidone included celecoxib ,94 Ginkgo piracetam.124 Studies short -term ( 10 wee ks of tr eatment) with no longer term follow up evaluation once treatment ended. Studies included a total of 561 children ranging in age from 3 to 17 years. All studies were conducted in Iran.90-100, 1 18, 124 We considered 1 1 studies to have low risk of bias90-100 and two to have moderate risk of bias.118, 124 Detailed Analysis Despite the number of RCTs with low or moderate risk of bias, studies present little evidence to inform treatment decisions and can be considered primarily as pilot efficacy trials. As noted, all studies were short -term and lacked followup past the end of treatment . Studies included few participan ts (median 40 total/study ) and few examined the same adjunct agent or out comes besides the ABC Irritability subscale. Only two studies 90, 93 addressed the same outcomes with different doses of the same agent ( N-acetylcysteine). All studies except one of gingko biloba added to risperidone reported significant improvements on the ABC -Irritability subscale in the adjunct groups compared with placebo plus risperidone ; one study reporting only total ABC scores reported s ignificant improvements in the adjunct group compared with placebo.124 We present a brief summary of key outcomes in each study below; Appendix F includes detailed tables of outcomes and harms . Harms typically did not differ between groups. N-acetyl cysteine. Two studies 90, 93 compared the effect of different doses of N -acetylcystein e as an adjunctive therapy to risperidone vs. placebo plus risperidone in a total of 80 chil dren with autistic disorder. By the end of treatment, the N -acetylcysteine groups had significantly greater reduction in irritability scores (p<0.035) than the placebo group in both the trials; in one RCT scores on the hyperactivity/noncompliance (p<0.05) subscales were also significantly improved 57 in the N -acetylcysteine group.90 Other subscale scores did not differ between groups in either RCT. Adverse events were mild and transient, with a similar incidence in bot h trials. Celecoxib . One RCT explored the effectiveness of adding celecoxib as an adjunct to risperidone vs. placebo plus risperidone in 40 children reported significant improvement s on the ABC irritability, lethargy/social withdrawal, and stereotypy sca les in the adjunct group compared with placebo plus risperidone .94 Hyperactivity/noncompliance or inappropriate speech did not differ between groups. The frequency of adverse effects as reported by parents was simi lar between the two groups. By week 10, complete response (50% reduction in irritability subscale) was achieved by 11 of the children in the celecoxib group compared with four (20%) in the placebo group (p=0.02). Ginkgo B iloba. In RCT comparing plus risperidone with risperidone plus placebo , investigators found no significant differences between groups on any of the ABC subscales. Side effects were similar between groups. Memantine . One RCT reported significant reduction in ABC subscale scores for irritability, stereotypic behavior, and hyperactivity in the memantine adjunct group compared with risperidone plus placebo (all p<0.01).95 No significant effects were found on the lethargy or inappropr iate speech subscales. Frequency of side effects including extrapyramidal symptoms was similar between the two groups. Riluzole . In one RCT including chil dren with autistic disorder who responded suboptimally to previous medication, children treated with riluzole and risperidone had significantly greater improvement in four of the five ABC subscales (p<0.01) than those receiving placebo plus risperidone .91 Based on CGI-I scores, complete response was achieved by 11 children (55%) in the riluzole group compared with five (25%) in the placebo group (p=0.05). Among the 16 side effects observed, increased appetite and weight gain were more frequently reported in the riluzole group versus the placebo group (p0.03). All other side effects occurred at a similar frequency in both groups. Buspirone . More children receiving buspirone plus risperidone had in irritability score (81.2% vs. p<0.01, RR=2.1) than those receiving placebo and risperidone . Investigators reported no serious adverse event s in either group, but the odds ratio for increased appetite was 2.61 (61.1% with buspirone vs. 35.3% with placebo). O ther commonly reported adverse events were drowsiness (11.1%) and fatigue (11.1%) in the buspirone group and dry mouth (5.9%) by the placebo group. Topiramate . In one RCT children in the topiramate adjunct group had significantly greater reduction in ABC -C subscale scores for irritability, stereotypic behavior, and hyperactivity/noncompliance (al l p=0.04) than those receiving placebo . 98 Frequencies of most side effects including extrapyramidal symptoms were similar, though somnolence (35% vs. 5%, p=0.04) and decreased appetite (35% p=0.04) occurred more frequently in the topiramate -treated group than the placebo group. 58 Amantadine . In one RCT including children with severe disruptive symptoms , ABC -Irritability and Hyperactivity/N oncompliance scores were significantly improved in amantadi ne adjunct group compared with the placebo group ( p 0.03) .96 By week 10, 17 (85%) of the children in the amantadine group compared with 13 (65%) in the placebo group had partial response (25% reduction in irritability subscale) (p=0.14), while complete response (50% reduction in irritability score) was achieved by 7 (35%) vs. 3 (15%) in the amantadine and placebo groups respectively (p=ns). None of the other ABC subscale scores differed between the groups by the end of treatme nt. Frequency of adverse effects did not differ between groups . Based on the improvement measured by CGI scale, a higher proportion of children in the amantadine group responded to treatment than those in the placebo group (50 % vs. 20%, p=0.047) , with two and eight children judged to have very much improved and much improved respectively in the amantadine group compared with one and three children in the placebo group. Pioglitazone . In one RCT children receiving pioglitazone adjunct Hyperactivity/noncompliance (p=0.04) subscale scores compared with the placebo group; 99 scores on other measure s did not differ betwe en groups . More children in the adjunct group also had a partial response (25% reduction in irritability score) than did children receiving placebo (45% vs. 15%, p=0.04) . Nine children (45%) in the pioglitazone group had c omplete response ( 50% reduction in irritability score) compared with 7 (35%) in the placebo group (p= ns). Adverse events were mild and transient with no group difference s in the frequency. Galantamine. In a trial evaluating galantamine or placebo in addition to risperidone, children i n the galantamine adjunct group showed significantly greater improvement in ABC -Irritability (p=0.017) and Lethargy/social withdrawal (p=0.005) subscales than the placebo group. 100 Reduction in other ABC subscale s cores after treatment was similar between the gro ups. Sixteen children (80%) in the galantamine group had a complete response ( 50% reduction in the irritability subscale score) compared with 10 (50%) in the placebo group (p=0.047), while partial response (25% reduction in the ABC -I subscale) was repor ted in 90% in the galantamine and 65% in the placebo group, p=0.058. The investigators noted no serious adverse events. Both groups reported weight gain by the end of the trial , with no significant group difference. Pentoxifylline . Scores on the ABC -Irritability, Lethargy/ Social W S tereotypic and I nappropriate S peech subscales were significantly better for the pentoxifyllin e adjunct group compared with placebo (p 0.0001) in one RCT .118 Frequency of side effects including extrapyramidal symptoms did not differ between groups. Piracetam . Risperidone plus piracetem was associated with more improvement on the ABC -C total s core than risperidone given with placebo in one RCT, with similar incidence of extrapyramidal symp toms and other adverse events. 124 Minocycline. Improvement s in ABC -Irritability and H yperactivity scales were greater in children receiving minocycline+risperidone than in children receiving placebo+ri speridone (p values 0.003) , but scores on the other subscales did not differ significantly between groups in one RCT (low risk of bias).89 Adverse events (including sedation, appetite changes, and gastrointestinal issues) did not dif fer between groups (p values= NS) 59 Studies of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Key Points Studies of hyperbaric oxygen using differing protocols reported conflicting results: no treatment effects in two RCTs and significant improvements in ASD symptoms in another. Data were inadequate to assess the effects of hyperbaric oxygen compared with placebo on ASD symptoms, language , or harms (insufficient strength of evidence). Overview of the Literature We identified three RCTs with low67, 114 and moderate66 risk of bias addressing hyperbaric oxygen compared with a sham treatment . Studies were conducted in the United States67, 114 and Thailand66 and included a total of 150 children between 2 and 14 years old. Treatment duration ranged from 20 days to 15 weeks with followup immediately post -treatment. Detailed Analysis Three RCTs of hyperbaric oxygen used dif ferent doses and reported inconsistent results (favorable effects associated with treatment in one and no significant effects in two) . The RCTs included children with diagnoses of autistic disorder67, 114 or autism .66 Two studies used a 24 percent oxygen treatment67, 114 and a third used 100 percent oxygen;66 children continued concomitant tr eatments including behavioral and medical interventions instituted prior to the studies. Two studies of 8067 or 2066 hourly treatments reported no significant differences between groups on measures of symptom severity, language, and adaptive behavior.66, 67 In a third RCT including 40 treatment sessions, clinician -rated overall CGI scores, parent -rated language and eye contact measures, the ABC -Irritability subscale, and the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist ( ATEC ) sensory scale improved significantly in the hyperbaric oxygen group compared with the placebo group. Other ABC or ATEC subscale scores did not differ significantly between groups .114 Harms of Hyperbaric Oxygen Studies typically noted that no significant harms occurred. One child had worsening asthma symptoms and discontinued treatment in one study,114 while 11 children in another experienced middle ear barotrauma that did not lead to discontinuation of the treatm ent session or the study.66 Across studies, one child withdrew due to seizures and one due to worsening asthma. Studies of N- acetylcysteine Key Points Two small RCTs of N -acetylcysteine reported few significant treatment effects and few clinically significant harms . N-acetylcysteine had no effect on social skills outcomes in two small RCT s; harms of this agent were not clinically significant. Our confidence in these conclusions is low (low strength of evidence). Data were inadequate to assess effects on other outcomes (insufficient strength of evidence). 60 Overview of the Literature Two RCT s with low78 and moderate79 risk of bias assessed N -acetylcysteine compared with placebo. Studies were conducted in the United States and Australia over 12 to 24 weeks and included a total of 123 children between 3 and 10 years old. Followup in both studies was immediately post- treatment. Detailed Analysis In one 12-week RCT (low risk of bias) comparing the utility of N-acetylcysteine with placebo, children treated with N -acetylcysteine had significant improvement on the ABC - Irritability subscale as compared with placebo -treated children (p<0.001);78 but effects on other behavioral and social measures did not differ. A second 24-week RCT (moderate risk of bias) included 98 children randomized to N -acetylcysteine or placebo and reported no group differences on any outcome assessed including social communication, adaptive behavior, symptom severity, or repetitive behavior.79 Table 19 outlines key outcomes. 61 Table 19.

Tetrahydrobiopterin had no effec t on symptom severity and was not associated with clinically significant harms. Our confidence in these conclusions is low (low strength of evidence). Data were inadequate to assess effects on other outcomes (insufficient strength of evidence). Overview o f the Literature Two RCTs with low53 and moderate103 risk of bias compared tetrahydrobiopterin and placebo. The studies included 56 children between 3 and 7 years old and r anged from 16 to 24 weeks duration with followup immediately post -treatment. Studies were conducted in the United States and Sweden. Detailed Analysis In one 16- week RCT (low risk of bias) comparing tetrahydrobiopterin and including children with VABS developmental quotients of at least 50, children in the treatment arm had better language, adaptive behavior, and social interaction skills at baseline compared with placebo participants. 53At followup immediately post- treatment, scores on the primary outcome, the CGI, were not significantly different between groups. Secondary outcomes favored the treatment group: children in the treatment group improved significantly more on the ABC Irritability, Lethargy, Stereotypy, Hyperactive and Inappropriate Speech scales; Social Responsiveness Scale 65 (SRS) total and subscale scores; and VABS composite and subscale measures than did children in the placebo group (p values <0.00). In another 24- week crossover RCT (moderate risk of bias) including 12 boys, overall CARS scores did not differ significantly between group. In a post -hoc analysis grouping CARS variables into those assessing social interaction, communication, and stereotypy, children in the treatment group had significant improvement in social interaction (p=0.04) but not in the other categories. 103 Table 21 outlines key outcomes.

While most studies reported some positive treatment effects on sleep, ASD symptoms, or language, data were inadequate to assess any comparisons given the heterogeneity of interventions (insufficient strength of evidence ). Overview o f the Literature We categorized studies as \"other\" if we could not assess strength of evidence for interventions and outcomes reported (i.e., insufficient strength of evidence) and the studies did not fall under a broader category of intervention such as diet or nutritional supplements . Fourteen studies ( 13 RCTs and 1 retrospective cohort study) addres sed other medical interventions .22, 23, 57, 68-75, 77, 100, 108, 115, 116, 123 Most agents or interventions were addressed in only one study. Two studies evaluated donepezil.77, 116 Agents or interventions addressed in single studies included melatonin,68 bumetanid e,72 transcranial stimulation (addressed levetiracetam.108 Three studies were included in our prior review ,23, 115, 116 including one RCT that now includes a followup analysis .22, 23 We considered six studies to have low risk of bias,22, 23, 57, 73 -75, 108seven to have moderate risk,68-72, 77, 115, 116 and one to have high risk.123 Studies included a total of 829 children (median 39 total children/study) between the ages of 2 and 19 years receiving treatment for 4 days to 9 months . Two studies rep orted followup after the end of treatment (1- 3 months post -treatment).71, 72 Detailed Analysis Despite the number of RCTs with low or moderate risk of bias, studies present little evidence to inform treatment decis ions and can be considered primarily as pilot efficacy trials. Most 68 studies were short -term and lacked followup past the end of treatment. Studies included few participants and few examined the same agent s. Two studies addressed donepezil but examined different outcomes. Harms reported in studies comparing these interventions were diverse, and their clinical significance is difficult to determine given the short- term nature of the studies and the typically low numbers of participants. Gastrointestinal sympt oms including constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal pain occurred frequently as did agitation, nervousness, or restlessness and appetite changes. We present a brief summary of key effectiveness outcomes in each study below; Appendix F includes detailed tab les of outcomes and harms. Donepezil. Two RCTs (moderate risk of bias) of donepezil assessed differing outcomes and reported no effects on executive function and treatment -associated improvements in language. In an RCT comparing donepezil and placebo , changes between groups on measures of executive function did not differ significantly after 10 weeks of treatment , though each group generally impr oved on each measure over time. 77 In a 10- week open label extension, participants generally improved slightly on most measures (differences between baseline and 5 mg or 10 mg doses not significant). Scores on verbal and nonverbal problem solving skills and flexibility of thinking worsened over time (baseline vs. 10- mg dose, p 0.004). In another crossover RCT addressed in our prior review , 11 children receiving donepezil versus placebo improved on clinician- rated measures of receptive and expressive language and symptom severity after 6 weeks of treatment (p values <0.05) .116 Citalopram . One low risk of bias RCT (reported in multiple publications) addressed the serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram and reported no significant effects on repetitive behavior and some positive effects on challenging behaviors compared with placebo.22, 23 The original study was included in our 2011 review and now includes a followup study examining potential predictors of response to citalopram (see KQ2) .22, 23 The study (low risk of bias) focused on repetitive behavior outcomes in children with PDD and significant repetitive behavior. Investigators reported no significant differences between citalopram and placebo arms on measures of repetitive beh avior, with similar baseline scores on the CYBOCS and similar improvements in each arm. The other measures of repetitive behavior, including the Repetitive Behavior Scale- Revised, also had similar improvements in each arm with no evidence for an effect of citalopram. The CGI -Improvement scale similarly showed no significant difference between the citalopram and the placebo arm. On the other hand, the primary measure of challenging behavior reported in this trial, the ABC -Irritability subscale, show ed an adv antage for citalopram with more improvement in the citalopram arm than for placebo. Memantine. One low risk of bias RCT included a 12- week , placebo -controlled phase to determine safety and tolerability of memantine and a 48 week extension (6 weeks dose t itration , with placebo participants moving to memantine followed by 42 weeks of maintenance treatment). 75 Both groups improved from baseline on caregiver -rated social skills (Social Responsiveness Scale) and on an unvalidated scale that measured symptom severity (Core Autism Treatment Scale -Improvement). Improvements were maintained over the extension period, but differences between groups at 12 weeks were not significant. Group differences on other measures of beha vior and language (e.g., ABC, Children's Communication Checklist) were not statistically different between groups. 69 Levetiracetam. One 10- week, low risk of bias RCT reported no significant group differences in parent - or teacher -rated ABC scores, overall symptoms (CGI), impulsivity/hyperactivity, or repetitive behavior, though repetitive behavior improved in both groups from baseline.108 Mecamylamine. One low risk of bias , 14-week RCT randomized children to eithe r mecamylamine in ascending doses (up to a maximum 5 mg/day) or placebo and reported no significant differences between groups on any of the outcome measures.73 Divalproex S odium. In a 12- week RCT with low risk of bias including children with ASD and significant irritability or aggression, children receiving divalproex had greater improvements in the CGI -Irritability and ABC -Irritability scales (p values <0.05), but scores on measures of aggression and repetitive behavior (Overt Aggression Scale -Irritability, CYBOCS) did not differ between groups. 74 In exploratory analyses changes in adaptive behavior or manic symptoms also did not differ between groups. Melatonin. A cros sover RCT with moderate risk of bias compared melatonin or placebo for 3 months followed by a 1 -month washout and 3 months of either melatonin or placebo.68 Sleep latency and total sleep were significantly reduced in the melatonin group compared with placebo (p.004), but night wakings did not differ between groups. Similarly, scores on the dysomnia scale of the Sleep Difficulties Questionnaire, but not the other sub- scales, were significantly lower for the treatmen t group compared with placebo (p=.041). Scores on the Developmental Behavior Checklist were significantly different between groups (mean difference=6.0, p= 0.05), with lower scores (improved behavior) in the melatonin group. Bumetanide. One RCT with moder ate risk of bias compared bumetanide or placebo for 3 months followed by repeat evaluations 1 month after the end of treatment. 72 After the 3 month treatment period, CARS scores for participants in the treatment gr oup declined from the severe range to medium or mild severity. At the 120 day followup, scores had shifted back toward pre - treatment values in both groups (p=ns). CGI scores were significantly improved in the treatment group compared with placebo at 120 da ys (p=0.02), but ADOS total scores did not differ between groups. In analyses removing children with the most severe symptoms, ADOS scores improved significantly in the treatment group (p= 0.03). Amantadine. One moderate risk of bias RCT of amantadine reported no significant effect of daily amantadine over 4 weeks on parent -rated ABC behavior scores and clinician -rated CGI rating of overall improvement compared with placebo. 115 However, children in the amantadine arm improved significantly more than those receiving placebo in clinician- rated ABC Hyperactivity and Inappropriate S peech subscales . Oxytocin. One RCT with moderate risk of bias including 38 boys with IQs of at least 80 and comorbid ADHD, oppositional de fiant disorder , or anxiety compared four doses of nasal oxytocin or placebo over 5 days . 71 Children also received an emotion recognition training program and completed family interaction tasks both before and after oxytocin administration. No outcomes (social interaction, repetitive behavior, emotion recognition, ASD severity) differed between groups on blinded i nvestigator -, parent -, and observation coder -ratings. 70 Prednisolone. In one retrospective study (high ris k of bias) including children considered to have \"regressive\" autism (defined as clinically determined loss of age -appropriate language, communication, cognitive abilities and behavior), children who received prednisolone (mean treatment duration of 9.13\u00b13.26 months, range=4- 14 months) improved significantly more on a parent - and clinician -rated measure of receptive and expressive language developed for the study.123 In followup of treated participants approximately 12 months after the end of treatment, participants with improved language (n=17) maintained or increased their improvements; three nonresponders continued to have no change in language in parent reports. Transcranial S timulation. One RCT with moderate r isk of bias assessed transcranial direct current stimulation using electrodes attached to the scalp to provide positive and negative electrical currents to putatively affect activity in regions of the brain that may play a role in ASD symptoms. 69, 70 Investigators allocated study participants (all males) with mild to moderate ASD to either active stimulation (2 sessions of roughly 20 minutes) or sham simulation. At 7 days post-treatment, mean clinician -rated CARS sc ores and parent -rated ATEC total, social, sensory, and health and behavioral problem (but not language) scores were significantly improved in the treatment group compared with placebo (p values <0.05) Scores on the clinician -rated CGAS were also more impro ved in the treatment group ( p<0.05) but CGI -Severity scores did not differ between groups. Investigators rated 45 percent of children receiving active treatment and 15 percent receiving sham treatment as \"much improved\" (p<0.05) and 10 percent in each arm as \"much worse\" (p=NS). KQ2. Modifiers of Treatment Outcomes Understanding the degree to which child characteristics (i.e., age, specific ASD- related difficulties an d skills), treatment factors (e.g., type, duration, intensity), and systems (e.g., famil y, community) influence response to treatments could improve targeting of treatments to the appropriate children and circumstances. While we sought modifying effects of child, provider, or intervention characteristics, few studies reported modifiers, and f ew were likely adequately powered to detect effects. We report modifying variables addressed in studies meeting our criteria as an indication of potential characteristics that may affect findings. Antipsychotics . A sub -analysis of an 8- week RCT of risperi done vs. placebo 34 analyzed mediators and moderators of the decrease in irritability .29 Baseline ABC -Irritability subscale score severity was the only significant moderator found. High severity was associated with greater improvement in irritability than was low severity in improvement with risperidone. Weight gain was the only significant mediator of response to risperidone. Greater weight gain was associated with less irritability improvement in the risperidone group. In an analysis of dose and compliance, better compliance was found to be associated with more improvement in the risperidone group and greater dose was associated with greater improvement. In another post -hoc analysis of data from an extension of the 8-week trial of risperidone, younger age and better communication skills were associated with greater gains in communication but not with gains in daily living skills or socialization as measured on the VABS. 37 No child characteristics were associated with gains in adaptive behavior and gains in each domain of adaptive behavior (e.g., communication, socialization) appeared to contribute equally to gains in the overall adapti ve behavior score. Reductions in aggression were also not associated with the magnitude of gains in adaptive behavior. 71 An additional analysis of this study analyzed the effect of initial severity of ASD on the efficacy of risperidone.110 This st udy found that parent -, but not clinician- , efficacy of risperidone on irritability and lethargy was greater with higher baseline measurements of severity (moderate through severity) of challenging behaviors. Effects of bas eline severity on clinician - rated ABC or CGI scores or parent ratings of other ABC scales (stereotypy, hyperactivity, inappropriate speech ) were not statistically significant. In secondary analyses of one RCT comparing aripiprazole and placebo, Caucasian children receiving aripiprazole had a relapse rate of 25.8 percent compared with 60.7 percent in the placebo group (HR=0.33, 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.78, p=0.01). Among non -White patients, the difference was not statistically significant. Age also did not interac t significantly with relapse.48 Finally, in one retrospective cohort study primarily assessing BMI change in children taking either risperidone or aripiprazole, investigators found no variables (baseline BMI or age, race, gender, intellectual disability, concomitant drug use, treatment duration) to be significant covariates of BMI Z -score change per year of treatment.122 ADHD Medications . In a double -blind cross -over trial o f methylphenidate in 66 children,24-27 authors found no effect of age, IQ, weight, or diagnosis on teacher - or parent -rated hyperactivity subscale scores, Swanson Nolan and Pelham rating scale or CYBOCS scores. Children with Asperger syndrome/PDD -NOS (n=19) showed a trend of being more likely to be classified as responders to both placebo and methylphenidate than those with autism. Response to each dose of methylphenidate was significantly superior to pla cebo in the autism subgroup but not for the Asperger / PDD -NOS subgroup. In a later analysis assessing gene variants potential ly associated with response, variations in seven SLC6A4, signaling were significant predictors, though the study was not powered to correct for multiple comparisons.24 In another RCT comparing guanfacine and placebo, cognitive skills were not significantly associat ed with treatment effects.46 Other Agents . Studies of other agents reported various potential modifiers of effects: Response to placebo (but not citalopram) was predicted by severity of disruptive behaviors, partic ularly hyperactivity, ASD severity and mood, and caregiver strain (p values .012) in one study .22, 23 Children with higher baseline scores on these measures exhibited less response to placebo. In a trial of atomox etine , scores on test s of inhibition control (go -no go task) and degree of distractibility by irrelevant information (focused -attention task) were not significantly correlated and did not correlate with changes in measures of ADHD symptoms.41-44 In a trial of divalproex, analyses suggested that children with abnormal epileptiform electroencephalogram (EEG) results were more likely to respond to divalproex than those with normal EEGs. 74 In analyses of treated children in this trial (n=16), children with higher blood levels of valproate (87- 100 mcg/ml) had a better response rate, and higher dose was associated with a moderate effect on improvement scores (p values=NR). Higher IQ was significantly correlated with improvements in social interaction in a post- hoc analysis in a crossover RCT comparing tetrahydrobiopterin and placebo.103 Age or total CARS scores were not significantly associ ated with improvements. In a trial of buspirone, children with fewer brain abnormalities in positron emission tomography scans had significantly more behavioral improvement than those with fewer, as children with normal ( not elevated) blood serotonin level s ( values 0.04); the serotonin association was not significant in multiple regression analysis.76 In one RCT comparing hyperbaric oxygen and sham treatment, older age 72 (> 5 years) and lower baseline symptom severity as meas ured on the ADOS were associated with better outcomes.114 An RCT comparing active and sham transcranial stimulation reported that increased left frontal lobe activity as indicated by increases in peak alpha frequen cies was associated with improvements in ATEC measures of social problems and health and behavior problems.69, 70 Few of the included trials of diet or supplement interventions: one trial of gluten -free diet compar ed with a regular diet reported no significant correlations between baseline behavioral or gastrointestinal measures and outcomes.62 In a trial of methyl- B12, improvement was positively correlated with increases in plasma levels of methionine an decreases in S -adenosylmethionine , and the ratio of these two levels (p values 0.05).87 No studies of risperidone adjuncts reported modifiers of effectiveness. KQ3. Time to Effect of Interventi ons Information about early response to treatment, or lack thereof, could guide treatment selection, implementation, and modification; however, no studies reported data to assess time to effect of interventions. While several studies reported changes in t he number of children responding to a given agent over time, studies did not provide data to determine the initiation of effect s. One study of aripiprazole noted that clinically important improvements were seen within 8 weeks of treatment, but treatment was not associated with delayed relapse (return of significant symptoms by 16 weeks of treatment/placebo ) compared with placebo. 48 In one study comparing risperidone and aripiprazole, improvement with aripiprazole w as evident in the first 12 weeks of treatment without additional improvements at 24 weeks, while scores on measures in children taking risperidone improved at 12 weeks and continued to improve over the 24 week period.50 The study does not indicate, however, when effects began to be observed. Another study assessing transcranial stimulation reported changes in peak alpha frequency immediately post - treatment in children receiving active versus sham stimulation (signif icant change from baseline in active treatment group and significant between group differences at some electrode sites), but the clinical effects of such changes are not clear. 69, 70 KQ4. Evidence that Effects Mea sured at the End of Treatment Predict Long- Term Functional Outcomes Few studies provided data to address this KQ. Few studies had longer -term followup and those with more than 6 months of treatment or followup typically did not re port functional outcomes . In one study, risperidone use was not associated with changes in IQ.28 Changes from baseline to the end of study in class assignment (e.g., special education, regular classroom) were not significant. KQ5. Effective ness Across Environments or Contexts Seven studies reported teacher ratings of outcome measures that provide some information to address this KQ , but the limited results preclude conclusions . One RCT of omega -3 fatty acids reported no significant group di fferences in teacher ratings of challenging behaviors (parents also rated few measures as improved) ,80 while another RCT of DHA supplementation versus placebo reported improvement in parent -rated social skills in c hildren receiving placebo vs. those receiving DHA, while teachers rated communication as more improved in the treatment group compared with placebo. 82 An RCT of gluten - or casein - containing challenge foods introduced to 73 a gluten -free diet reported no statistically significant changes in behavior as rated by parents or teachers on the Connors scale.60 An RCT of levetiracetam vs. placebo reported no significant group differences on any parent - or teacher - rated measures but also noted that teachers , but not parents, rated children in the placebo arm as more improved on irritability compared with the levetiracetam group (p=0.003).108 RCT s of methylphenidate reported general agreement between parent and teacher ratings of hyperactivity.24-27, 45 In one RCT, both parents and teachers considered hyperactivity and impulsive behavior to be significantly improved in the treatment group compared with placebo , but teachers (vs. parents) reported no significant group differences in inattention or oppositional behavior. Finally, one RCT of atomoxetine reported significant teacher -rated improvements in hyperactivity in the atomoxetine group compared with placebo, but teacher ratings of cognitive problems/inattention, oppositional behavior, or overall ADHD symptoms did not differ between groups.41-44 In another RCT comparing atomoxetine alone, atomoxetine + parent training , placebo alone, and placebo + parent training, parents , but not teachers, rated children in active treatment groups as significantly improved on measures of ADHD, inattention, hyperactivity, and oppositional behavior.54, 55 KQ6. Drivers of Treatment Outcomes We did not identify studies that provided data to address this KQ. 74 Discussion State of the Literature We identified a total of 76 unique comparative studies , primarily (n= 72) randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ), addressing medical interventions. Most studies were small (median 40 total participants/study) and addressed variable agents. Most studies had placebo comparators, while five (reported in multiple publications) compared a pharmaceutical agent to behavioral treatment or combined pharmaceutical and behavioral treatment.54-57, 120, 121 Treatment length varied from four days to 24 months , with few studies (n=3) reporting longer term followup after the immediate interven tion period.71, 72, 120 The methodologic rigor of studies increased substantially over those studies reported in our 2011 review of therapies for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).11 Thirty -three studies in the current review ha ve low risk of bias and 20 ha ve moderate risk. While studies were generally well -conducted, evidence remains insufficient for m ost interventions given small sample sizes, lack of longer term followup, and heterogeneous agents and populations. While most studies targeted challenging behaviors, only four (reported in multiple publications) explicitly included children with diagnosed comorbidities such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) . 40-44, 71, 80 Twenty-eight studies used variable criteria to define challenging behaviors , including specific cut -off scores on subscales of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) ; parent -reported irritability ; clinician observations of irritability or hyperactivity ; or th e presence of undefined \"severe\" behavioral symptoms. Other studies reported no specific indications. Despite the limitations of the literature, some interventions have high strength of evidence. Specifically, the strength of evidence for the antipsychoti cs risperidone and aripiprazole is high for the amelioration of ir ritability in the short term ( 6 months of treatment) for children with significant challenging behaviors at baseline. However, the strength of evidence is also high for significant side eff ects (e.g. , extrapyramidal symptoms, weight gain ). Longer term effectiveness is not as well studied, but uncontrolled open- label analyses have suggested some continued efficacy. In studies (reported in multiple publications ), children receiving t he psychos timulant methylphenidate had improvements in hyperactivity, but small sample sizes preclude firm conclusions about durability of effects .24-27, 45 Two studies (in multiple publications ) of atomoxetine also reported positiv e effects on hyperactivity, potentially with fewer adverse effects than methylphenidate.40-44 Other studies of agents such as adjuncts to risperidone reported some positive effects but studies were small, often underpowered, and typically not replicated. Studies of nutritional supplements or specialized diets reported few positive effects as did studies of hyperbaric oxygen. Despite the number of new studies, we can make few conclusions beyond those reached in our 2011 review. Evidence supports the effectiveness of antipsychotics in improving challenging behaviors, but with significant harms. Methylphenidate also improves hyperactivity but with significant harms. Evidence is promising for the ADHD medication atomoxetine. More studies have addressed combination approaches, but data are inadequate to draw conclusions. Data were limited and inconsistent for other interventions. 75 Summary of Key Findings and Strength of the Evidence Key Question ( KQ) 1. Benefits and Harms of Medical Treatments Studies of Antipsychotics Key Findings Studies of antipsychotics addressed either risperidone or aripiprazole and reported significant improvements in measures of challenging behavior in the short term (<6 months) in childre n receiving the medications compared with those receiving placebo. Harms of these agents, including extrapyramidal symptoms and weight gain, were also significant. Studies reporting longer term followup (up to 21 months for risperidone) suggest continued p otential eff icacy in many children but did not include control groups that would permit stronger conclusions . Studies comparing risperidone and aripiprazole reported few differences in effects on outcomes or harms. Strength of the Evidence Our confidence in the conclusion that r isperidone and aripiprazole improve cha llenging behaviors in the short term (<6 months), with clinically significant harms. is high (high strength of evidence). Behaviors improved in the longer term ( 6 months) with these agents compared with placebo, but our confidence in this conclusion is low (low strength of evidence) as few studies had longer -term followup. In studies comparing risperidone and aripiprazole, BMI increased with both drugs ov er treatment durations of 6 months to more than 2 years, but group differences were not significant. We have low confidence in this conclusion given the few studies addressing this outcome (low strength of evidence). Other outcomes (e.g., challenging behav iors, attention ) were not consistently addressed; thus we considered strength of evidence insufficient for all other intervention/outcome pairs. Table 23 outlines these findings. 76 Table 23.

Both RCTs addressing methylphenidate reported statistically significant improvements in hyperactivity in children treated with medium to high doses compared with placebo.24-27, 45 Findings for oppositional behavior and social communication were inconsistent. RCTs addressing atomoxetine reported statistically significant treatment- related improvem ents compared with placebo that were maintained over 20 weeks of open label, uncontrolled treatment in one study; inattention was statistically significantly improved in one study. 40-44 One small RCT of guanfacine reported improvements in hyperactivity, impulsiveness, 78 and attention.46 Side effects were associated with all agents including aggressive behavior , gastrointestinal symptoms, irritability, and appetite changes. Strength of the Evidence Methylphenidate. Methylphenidate vs. placebo improved hyperactivity and was associated with clinically significant harms (Table 24) . Our confidence in these conclusions is low as studies were small and short term (low strength of ev idence). Data were inadequate to assess effects on social communication and oppositional behavior (insufficient strength of evidence). Findings for oppositional behavior were inconsistent in two studies;25, 45 thus, we could not assess the strength of evidence (insufficient ). We considered the evidence inadequate to comment on potential effects on social communication or oppositional behavior (insufficient strength of evidence). Atomoxetine. We found positive effe cts of atomoxetine compared with placebo on hyperactivity in children with ASD and ADHD in the short term (<6 months), with effects maintained over the longer term (6 months) (Table 24) . Our confidence in this conclusion is low (low strength of evidence). Atomoxetine was associated with harms considered to be clinically moderate, and our confidence in this conclusion is low (low strength of evidence). Data were inadequate to assess effects on inattention as studies reported inconsistent findings (insuffici ent strength of evidence). Guanfacine . Data were inadequate in this small study to draw conclusions about effects on any outcomes (insufficient strength of evidence). Table 24.

Atomoxetine plus parent training or atomoxetine alone were both associated with improvements in ADHD, inattention, hyperactivity, noncompliance, and overall symptom severity compared with placebo, with improvements maintained over 24 weeks for most treatment responders in one RCT . 55, 132 Differences between atomoxetine groups were not statistically significant for any outcome. Melatonin and melatonin plus cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) both improved sleep- related outcomes in a second RCT. 57 Folic acid plus Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) treatment and folic acid alone both improved behaviors, with 80 no sig nificant group differences in one nonrandomized trial.121 In another RCT, bumetanide plus applied behavior analysis improved symptom severity and behavior more than applied behavior analysis alone.56 In a final nonrandomized trial, s tem cell transplantation plus rehabilitation therapy improved symptom severity, lethargy, and stereotypy more than umbilical cord blood cell transplant plus rehabilitation therapy or rehabilitation therapy alone.120 Strength of the Evidence Given that combination therapies were investigated in single studies, we could not make conclusions about their effects on any outcomes (insufficient strength of evidence). Studies of Nutritional Supplements and Dietary Interventions Key Findings Three RCTs comparing omega- 3 fatty acid supplementation with placebo reported no significant group differences in measures of challenging behavior; these studies did not consi stently assess language and adaptive behavior outcomes , and no study reported clinically significant harms. While two RCTs addressed methyl B12 supplementation, results were inconsistent, with one study reporting positive effects on symptom severity 87 and another reporting no significant effects.83 Four RCTs (multiple publications) compared GFCF diets to either an unaltere d diet or a diet that contained gluten and dairy and reported few differences in behavioral measures between children on restricted or unrestricted diets.63-65, 104 -107 One RCT comparing a gluten -free diet and regular diet reported significant improvements in gastrointestinal symptoms and behavior in the gluten -free group,62 while another comparing a gluten and dairy -free diet to usual diet reported no significant effects.58 Two RCTs evaluating \" challenges\" of gluten - or casein -containing foods reported no significant group differences in measures of challenging behavior,59, 60 while a high risk of bias study evaluating antioxidant -rich camel's milk reported no significant differences in ASD severity between children receiving boiled or raw camel's milk or cow's milk.61 Despite the number of RCTs with low or moderate risk of bias addressing other supplements or diets, data are also inadequate to determine effects on any outcome in the short - or long -term. Most studies were small and short -term (ranging from 1 week to 7 months, with 24 months of treatment in one study). Strength of the Evidence Omega- 3 fatty acid supplementation and placebo did not affect challenging behaviors. Our confidence in this conclusion is low (low strength of evidence for no eff ect) (Table 25). We also have low confidence in the conclusion that omega -3 supplementation was associated with minimal harms (low strength of evidence). Data in two small studies of methyl- B12 were inadequate to draw conclusions (insufficient strength of evidence). Despite the number of RCTs with low or moderate risk of bias addressing other agents , evidence was inadequate to make conclusions about all clinical efficacy and harms outcomes because few, small, underpowered studies addressed each diet or supplement (insufficient strength of evidence). While seven studies addressed variations of the GFCF diet, studies addressed different outcomes and different approaches to restricted and control diets; thus, data were inadequate to make conclusions about the body of evidence (insufficient strength of evidence). Data were 81 inadequate to allow conclusions about the relative effectiveness of other dietary interventions (e.g., camels' milk, gluten -containing challenge foods) compared with placebo (insufficient strength of evidence).

A ll studies were short -term and lacked followup pa st the end of treatment. Studies included few participants (median 40 total/study) and few examined the same adjunct agent or outcomes besides the ABC Irritability subscale. Only two studies 90, 93 addressed the sam e outcomes with different doses of the same agent ( N-acetylcysteine). All studies except one of G ingko biloba added to risperidone reported significant improvements on the ABC -Irritability subscale in the adjunct groups compared with placebo or placebo plus risperidone; one study reporting only total ABC scores reported significant improvements in the adjunct group compared with placebo. 124 Strength of the Evidence Data were inadequate to assess effects of risperid one plus adjunctive on any outcome assessed as no study addressed the same adjunctive agent (insufficient strength of evidence) . Studies were also small (<50 children in any study ) and short - term (8 -10 weeks of treatment). While two RCTs address ing risperidone plus N -acetylcysteine reported improvements in irritability with the combination vs. risperidone plus placebo, evidence 82 is inadequate to comment on effects given the small number of participants (n=71 total), high attrition (15% to 30% across groups) and short -term nature (10 weeks each) of the studies (insufficient strength of evidence) . Studies of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Key Findings Three RCTs of hyperbaric oxygen used different doses and reported inconsistent results (favorable effects associated with treatment in only one114 and no significant effects in two66, 67). Strength of the Evidence Data were inadequate to assess effects on outcomes given inconsistencies in outcome reporting (insufficient strength of evidence). Studies of N-acetylcysteine Key Findings One RCT assessing N -acetylcysteine repor ted significant improvements in irritability (ABC - I) in treated children vs. those receiving placebo and no statistically significant effects on other measures of social skills or challenging behaviors.78 Another R CT reported no significant treatment effects on any outcomes (symptom severity, social skills, repetitive behaviors).79 Harms were not statistically significantly different between treatment and placebo groups. Strength of the Evidence N-acetylcysteine had no effect on social skills outcomes in two small RCTs ; harms of this agent were not clinically significant . Our confidence in these conclusions is low (low strength of evidence) (Table 26) . Data were inadequate t o assess effects on other outcomes including symptom severity given inconsistent findings in these two studies (insufficient strength of evidence). Table 26.

Strength of t he Evidence Tetrahydrobiopterin had no effect on symptom severity and was not associated with significant harms. Our confidence in these conclusions is low (low strength of evidence). Data were inadequate to assess effects on other outcomes including adapt ive and challenging behavior (insufficient strength of evidence). Table 27 outlines findings. Table 27.

Two RCTs of donepezil assessed differing outcomes and reported no effects on executive function and treatment -associated improvements in language.11, 77 Agents A ddressed in S ingle S tudies. Studies of citalopra m,22, 23 and divalproex74 reported positive effects on measures of challenging behavior associated with treatment compared with placebo. Measures of language or symptom severity improved more in treatment arms versus control arms in studies of prednisolone, 123 and transcranial stimulation,69, 70 One study of amantadine reported significant im provements in hyperactivity relative to placebo.115 One RCT reported improvements in time to fall asleep and sleep time with melatonin versus placebo,68 and one of bumetani de compared with placebo reported positive effects of bumetanide on symptom severity .72 Single s tudies of oxytocin71 and mecamylamine73 reported no significant treatment effects. Harms reported in studies comparing these interventions were diverse, and their clinical significance is difficult to determine given the short- term nature of the studies and the typically low numbers of par ticipants .

KQ5. Effectiveness Across Environments or Contexts Five studies reported teacher ratings of outcome measures that provide some information to address this KQ , but the limited results preclud e conclusions . KQ6. Drivers of Treatment Outcomes We did not identify studies that provided data to address this KQ . Findings in Relation to What I s Already Known We identified 16 recent (2010- present) systematic reviews or meta- analyses addressing medical interventions for children with ASD. Three reviews evaluated the a ntipsy chotics 85 aripiprazole and risperidone ; six evaluated multiple agents including antipsychotics; and seven evaluated agents including SSRIs, atomoxetine, melatonin, and hyperbaric oxygen. Overall, findings in these reviews generally aligned with the findings presented here, with high strength of evidence for short -term effectiveness of aripiprazole and risperidone to ameliorate challen ging behaviors and high strength of evidence for adverse effects of each agent. Several reviews commented on atomoxetine as a promising agent, and one commented on melatonin to improve sleep problems . Reviews noted and agents. Reviews generally considered s tudie s of antipsychotics to have high quality and the quality of studi es addressing stimulants and atomoxetine as moderate to high. Reviews generally considered studies addressing nutritional supplements, diets and hyperbaric oxygen as moderate to low quality. Reviews consistently commented on a lack of long term data and ty pically small sample sizes as limitations of the strength of the evidence. Antipsychotics One Cochrane review of aripiprazole included two RCTs and reported significant short -term treatment -related improvements on irritability, hyperactivity, and repetitive movement with weight gain, sedation, drooling, and neurological side effects.133 Another review including children with ASD (n=637), developmental disorders (n=68), or intellectual disability (n=50) noted that all of the 20 included randomized and observational studies reported significant treatment -related improvements in problem behaviors measured on the Clinical Global Impression ( CGI) scale or ABC. 134 Most studies reported adverse effects including weight gain, sedation, and tremor. Both reviews noted a need for longer term studies to address durability of effects. One meta -analysis of risperidone (n=608 children) reported a mean effect size for risperidone of 1.09 across studies (1.14 for open label studies and 1.12 for placebo- controlled) using global outcome measures such as the Childhood Autism Rating Scale ( CARS ) and CGI.135 The effect size for outcomes related to maladaptive behaviors such as irritability and aggression was 1.20. Reviews of Multiple Agents Agents T o Treat I rritability and P roblem B ehaviors. One review and meta- analysis addressed treatment of severe irritability and problem behaviors and included 11 RCTs that used the ABC - Irritability subscale in quantitative analyses. The review reported significant tr eatment effects for aripiprazole (effect size=0.9), risperidone (effect size=0.8), and N-acetylcysteine (effect size=0.7) with Harm s occurring with risperidone and aripiprazole included somnole nce or sedation, aripiprazole and haloperidol. Aripiprazole, risperidone, and valproate caused greater weight gain compared with placebo (effect sizes of 3.1, 0.8, and 0.3, respectively). Investigators also noted s maller effects for clonidine, methylphenidate , tianeptine, venlafaxine , in not specifically target irritability and that atomoxetine and dextromethorphan were associated with improvements in hyperactivity and impulsivity on the ABC -Hyperactivity subscale. Psychotropic M edications. One review of 17 different medications reported addressed in 33 RCTS reported little established evidence to support any medication.137 Investigators cons idered 86 aripiprazole , risperidone, haloperidol to hyperactivity (risperidone); irritability, . The revi ew noted promising evidence for methylphenidate's effects on hyperactivity. Investigators considered evidence preliminary for the effects of risperidone on repetitive behavior and stereotypy , for the effects of atomoxetine and naltrexone on hyperactivity , and for pentoxifylline on irritability and social withdrawal. Investigators reported evidence as insufficient for all other social behavior, hyperactivity, and repetitive behavior. Agents T o Treat ADHD S ymptoms. One review identified seven placebo -controlled trials of medications targeting ADHD symptoms in children with Pervasive Development Disorders (n=225 children) and reported that methylphenidate was significantly more effective than placebo in treating ADHD symptoms ( effect size 0.67 ) and hyperactivity specifically (effect size=0.66) 138 Appetit e decrease, insomnia, depressive symptoms, irritability , and social withdrawal occurred significantly more frequently in the treatment group versus placebo. The review reported no significant effects for clonidine versus placebo and significant improvement s in ADHD symptoms and hyperactivity in children taking at omoxetine compared with placebo. Harms included nausea, decreased appetite, and sleep changes. Antiepileptic Medications. One meta- analysis evaluated valproate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and topiramate in children with ASD . 139 In meta- analyses, single agents studied were not significantly different between treatment and placebo arms. One study of topiramate combined with risperidone reported improvements in irritability in the combination group compared with risperidone plus placebo. Two studies of valproate and one of levetiracetam reported no response to treatment as defined by CGI ratings. Discontinuation due to a dverse effects did not differ between gr oups nor did the rate of total adverse events. Alzheimer 's Medications . One review addressed use of these medications for children and adults with ASD and included case reports and other observational studies and controlled trials . 140 Drugs assessed in children included donepezil, galantamine, rivastig mine, and memantine. Four uncontrolled and one controlled studies of donepezil reported treatment - associated improvements in ASD symptoms. All three studies of galantamine (2 RCTs and 1 case series) reported positive effects on core and associated ASD symptom s. One small case series addressing rivastigmine reported improvements in expressive language and ASD symptoms, and three studies (1 RCT, 2 case series) of memantine use in children also reported positive effects on i rritability and associated symptoms with side effects including gastrointestinal symptoms, worsening behavior, and sedation. The review concluded that evidence is inconsistent and inconclusive but further study of some agents such as rivastigmine may be warranted. Predictors of Placebo R espon se. One meta- analysis included data from 25 RCTs measuring outcomes with either the ABC, CGI, VABS, CARS, or Children's Yale -Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( CYBOCS ) and reported a moderate but significant placebo response across studies (effect size=0.45 , identified clinician - 87 completed outcome measures, level of response to active intervention, a pharmacologic active intervention (vs. diet, etc.), use of adjunctive treatment, and geographical location of the trial (greater response in Iran vs. Unit ed States) as significant moderators of the placebo response, with each factor associated with an increased response. Reviews of Other Agents Atomoxetine. One review of atomoxetine included six studies (1 RCT) evaluating the agent for treatment of hypera ctivity in children with ADHD (n=90).142 All studies except one (which included children with \"severe autistic disorder\") reported significant improvements in behavior in parent, teacher, and clinician ratings with treatment. Harms reported included gastrointestinal symptoms, somnolence , irritability, and weight loss; the review concluded that evidence suggests potential efficacy but small sample sizes and short- term studies limit conclusions. Hyperbaric O xygen T herapy. One review including eight studies (2 RCTs) reported little eviden ce for effects of hyperbaric oxygen in controlled trials, and some promising evidence in small case series. 143 Few studies repor ted any adverse effects at the pressure levels studied. SSRIs . One Cochrane review included nine RCTs (5 including only children) evaluating (n= 239 children) evaluating the SSRIs fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, fenfluramine, and citalopram.144 The review reported n o evidence for the effectiveness of SSRIs and potential evidence for harms. Omega -3 Fatty A cids. One Cochrane review included two RCTs (n=37 children, predominately male with moderate to severe ASD symptoms) evaluating omega -3 fatty acids and reported no evidence for effects on social interaction, communication, hyperactivity, or stereotypy . 145 GFCF D iets. One review included 32 studies, typically with high risk of bias , and noted scar ce evidence for GFCF diets, with positive effects reporte d only in lower quality studies. 146 The review concluded that evidence for the effectiveness or harms of GFCF diets is limited and weak. Melatonin. One review included 18 studies addr essing melatonin for the treatment of sleep problems in ASD. 147 Thirteen observational studies reported improvements in sleep duration, night awakenings , or sleep onset latency , as did five RCTs. Investigators meta -analyzed RCT data and reported significant improvements on these measures with melatonin versus placebo . Harms associated with melatonin included drowsiness , gastrointestinal symptoms , and worsening behavior. No study reported serious adverse events. Chelation. Though we did not identify studies addressing chelation agents in the current review, one Cochran e review addressed chelation therapy and included one RCT (n=49 children). 148 Investigators considered the study to have high risk of bias and noted that no evidence suggests efficacy for ASD symptoms. Applicability By definition , ASD is heterogeneous. Characterizing a \"typical\" child with an ASD is not possible, although certain symptoms are central to the range of children within the autism spectrum. Individual therapies are developed and tested to ameliorate specific symptoms o r 88 groups of symptoms, often in a fairly circumscribed subset of children. W e provide details on the population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, and setting (PICOS) for each intervention addressed in more than one study in Appendix E to support translat ion of our findings and assessment of the applicability of each for differing circumstances and children. Overall, s tudy participants were generally recruited from specialty clinical service programs and represent nonprimary care populations. As such, fam ilies of these children may be seeking a higher level of care than those of the broader population of children with ASD based upon more severe or acute symptoms, including aggression or other challenging behaviors. Most studies of medical interventions tar geted elementary school aged and older children with autism, with little data on the treatment of younger children. Most s tudies included majority male populations (consistent with the male prevalence of ASD). Studies also included children with highly variable severity of challenging behaviors, ASD symptom severity, and cognitive impairment. Studies of pharmacological agents often sampled children with high levels of specific symptom patterns (e.g., children with severe challenging behavior at baseline w here parents may be willing to pursue pharmacologic intervention and trial participation) who may not reflect the wider population of children with ASD in whom these challenges may not be present. Most of the studies reported including children with at lea st moderate level of severity of ASD. Studies of stimulants included children with cognitive impairmen t and with comorbidities including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder. Studies of other approaches had similarly heterogeneous populations. Dietary and nutritional studies included some younger children, with severity of autism not well described or the degree of intellectual functioning not well characterized in most studies. This hete rogeneity in population characteristics may limit the generalizability of findings to children with differing levels of symptom expression or comorbidities but likely reflects the heterogeneity of the broader population of children with ASD Studies addres sed a variety of agents and typically reported use of concurrent medications or other therapies. Most agents studied are accessible in the United States , albeit with few receiving FDA approval for use. Comparators among non- placebo controlled studies varie d, and few studies assessed the effect of concomitant behavioral or other therapies, though many children with ASD receive multiple interventions. The treatments studied may not adequately reflect the broad range of treatment combinations used in the gener al population of children with ASD. As noted, few studies eva luated longer term treatment (> 6 months); short treatment and followup periods limit our ability to understand potential longer term outcomes such as academic achievement or longer term harms. O verall , the heterogeneity of these studies parallels the heterogeneity of children with ASD , and some findings may be more applicable to children with specific levels of baseline severity or comorbidities. These limitations to generalizability likely reflect both the significant heterogeneity of ASD itself as well as its associated features, such as irritability. Thus, while there is a growing evidence base for treating certain symptoms in certain populations, these findings underscore the continued need fo r individualized treatment approaches that are informed by the emerging evidence base for benefits as well as harms of medical intervention, with careful consideration of symptom presentation and functioning level relative to study populations and applicability of the known literature. 89 Implications for Clinical and Policy Decisionmaking This review provides some evidence for decisionmaking about medical interventions for children with ASD. The clearest evidence favors the use of the antipsychotics r isper idone and aripiprazole to address challenging behaviors in the short -term (<6 months); however, clinicians and caregivers must balance the significant harms of these agents. The s ignificant side effect profiles make it clear that although these drugs are efficacious, caution is warranted regarding their use in patients without severe impairments or risk of injury . Few studies addressed longer term effects of these agents; thus, o ur confidence in longer term (> 6 months) effectiveness is low. Studies of adjuncts to risperidone typically reported positive effects on challenging behaviors, but few studies addressed the same agents, precluding our ability to draw conclusions about their effectiveness. Some evidence supports the use of methylphenidate and atomoxet ine for hyperactivity, but few comparative studies addressed each agent, so our confidence in effects is limited. Given that many children with ASD are currently treated with medical interventions, strikingly little evidence exists to support clear benefit for most medical interventions, especially in the realm of interventions such as restrictive diets and supplements. Studies of nutritional supplements or specialized diets were typically underpowered and provided little evidence of effects of these approa ches. Several agents were addressed in single studies, which limits conclusions about their effects. Decisional dilemmas remain regarding characteristics of the child, family, or intervention that may modify effectiveness or predict which children may be most likely to benefit from a given approach. Similarly, the literature base is currently insufficient to inform our understanding of the time to effect of interventions, longer term effectiveness of interventions, generalizability of effects outside the t reatment context, effectiveness and applicability to broader ASD populations, and components that may drive effectiveness . Limitations of the Comparative Effectiveness Review Process We included studies published in English only and did not include unpubl ished data. We scanned a random sample of 150 non- English abstracts retrieved by our MEDLINE search. Most studies appeared to be case series, narrative reviews, basic science studies, or studies assessing etiology . Only two studies appeared to meet inclusi on criteria; thus, given the high percentage of ineligible items in this scan (9 9%), we concluded that excluding non- English studies would not introduce significant bias into the review . We recognize that this preliminary scan did not address the entire co rpus of ASD literature in other languages . We also included only comparative studies of medical interventions with at least 10 children with ASD. To ensure comprehensive coverage of the literature, we included comparative studies with smaller sample size that would have been excluded in our 2011 review (which required a sample size of 30) in the present report. We did not conduct a de novo search for such studies but re-examined the excluded studies from the prior review. This approach may have overlooked relevant studies. Given heterogeneity in treatment regimens, outcomes addressed in each study, and patient populations, we were limited in our ability to meta -analyze findings or identify potential subgroups that may respond more favorably to specific treatments . Finally, we used a nonvalidated tool to assess risk of bias, though we note that the tool evaluates similar constructs 90 to those assessed in tools such as that used by the Cochrane Collaboration, with the addition of ASD- specific domains. Limitations of the Evidence Base As noted, studies in the review had small sample sizes and typically limited duration of intervention and followup after intervention, despite significant improvements in study design and execution over time. Populations across studies were heterogeneous in terms of challenging behaviors, ASD symptom severity, age, and comorbidities. Few studies addressed the same agent and outcomes, and few assessed potential factors that may modify effectiveness or drive effects of interventions. M any (n= 63) studies also explicitly noted that concomitant interventions were held steady during the study treatment period; however, few studies reported specific analyses to control for or assess the effects of additional treatments. Despite these limitations, investigators have made significant improvements in incorporating commonly used measures of symptom severity and behavior to facilit ate comparisons across studies. Studies also typically described interventions fully, used standardized diagnostic processes and blinded assessors , and reported on the use or restriction of concomitant interventions. Research Gaps and Areas for Future Research Improving research in this area should include methodologic considerations of power and sample size and durabili ty of effects. S ample size and participant followup were frequently insufficient to allow firm conclusions . Duration of treatment and followup w ere generally short (<6 months); those studies with longer duration of treatment were typically open label exten sions of RCTs and lacked control arms. While duration was typically short, retaining participants in studie s, especially in placebo arms, is difficult when parents or children perceive little improvement in symptoms. Longer duration of treatment, however, is also important to rule out meaningful improvements in placebo groups and help inform our understanding of the placebo effect . Few studies provid ed data on long- term outcomes after cessation of treatment. Future studies should extend the followup period and assess the degree to which outcomes are durable in \"real world\" situations . The literature includes many single studies of various agents. Studies of adjuncts to risperidone , for example , examined different adjunct agents, with some positive effects on challenging behaviors reported with most. Understanding which agents should be examined further is lacking. Another critical area for further research is identifying which children are likely to benefit from particular interventions. To date, studies have provided limited characteriz ation of the subpopulation of children who experience positive response to medical interventions and limited characterization of the extent or type of behavioral challenges children experience at baseline. Children with ASD al so typically receive multiple types of therapies, but few studies addressed combinations of medical and behavioral or other categories of interventions or a medical treatment compared with a nonmedical treatment. Few attempted to account for potential effe cts on ongoing interventions. This not only limited our ability to interpret the effects of medical treatments in isolation but represents a significant gap for families and providers in choosing additional treatments that may bolster (or impair) the effec ts of behavioral, medication, or other ther apies. Few studies (n= 10) compared active treatments, and future 91 research to assess the comparative effectiveness of antipsychotics, ADHD medications, and other medications is necessary. In addition, much of the medical intervention literature relies on baseline and outcome measures that have specific limits in understa nding individualized response. Future research attempting to elucidate potential biobehavioral markers of response may prove useful. Research in understanding outcomes of importance to patients and caregivers, such as quality of life, is also lacking. Harms reporting varied across studies; some studies amply described how harms were tracked, while others listed harms with no indication of how they w ere assessed (e.g., parent recall, checklist, clinician assessment during followup). This lack of reporting makes comparing harms across studies difficult. For instance, while studies of atomoxetine generally reported fewer harms than did studies of methyl phenidate in children with ADHD symptoms, exploring differences in safety profiles is an important area for additional research. Conclusions Risperidone and aripiprazole ameliorated challenging behaviors in the short term (<6 months), but had significant side effects. Methylphenidate and atomoxetine were also associated with improvements in hyperactivity in small, short- term RCTs (with uncontrolled open label extensions). Atomoxetine plus parent training was not more effective for hyperactivity than atomox etine alone. Omega -3 fatty acid supplementation was not associated with improvements in challenging behaviors, and N -acetylcysteine and tetrahydrobiopterin were not associated with improvements in social skills and symptom severity, respectively. Some posi tive effects were reported with other agents studied (risperidone adjuncts, melatonin), but few studies addressed the same agent or outcomes. Data on longer term (>6 months) results and harms of interventions are lacking. Similarly, more research is needed to understand characteristics of the child or treatment that modify outcomes and whether effectiveness of interventions generalizes across different settings such as the home or school. Current evidence also does not inform our understanding of components of interventions that may drive effects. S ome therapies hold promise and warrant further study, and the conduct of studies has improved considerably over time (i.e., growing number of randomized controlled trials and use of standardized measures). However , additional studies with larger, well- characterized populations over longer time frames, and that utilize transparent and rigorous methods that permit comparison across studies, would further inform decisionmaking . 92 References 1.

Antipsychotics Domain Description of applicability of evidence compared to question Population Studies typically included participants recruited from non-primary care populations (university/academic -affiliated clinics, research centers), which may limit applicability to the wider population; participants i n RCT s had an average age of roughly 9 years in the treatment and comparison groups and included a mojority male subjects. In studies providing IQ data, the majority of subjects had IQs in the intellectual disability range. Studies reported use of concurrent medications but typically did not report on co- morbid conditions. Most of the studies report including children with at least moderate level of severity of ASD. Intervention Antipsychotics evaluated included risperidone and aripiprazole in dose ranges used in some children with ASD. Comparators RCTs compared treatment to placebo or to another medication (e.g., haloperidol, aripiprazole, memantine) . Outcomes Studies primarily targeted outcomes related to problem behavior (irritability, hyperactivity) and repetitive behavior, which are significant concerns in the ASD population. Outcome measures used to assess change were appropriate; although the duration of s tudies was typically less than 6 months, and evaluation was typically immediately post -treatment. Some studies included open label, uncontrolled extensions. Studies reported adverse effects including sedation, weight gain, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Sho rt-term harms and outcomes generally reflect longer -term outcomes measured over roughly 24 months . Setting Studies were conducted in the US, Canada, Iran, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, and India, primarily in academic clinics or research centers which may have yielded more selected populations. ASD -Autism Spectrum Disorder; IQ -Intelligence Quotient; RCT -Randomized, Controlled Trial Table E -2. Medications to treat ADHD Domain Description of applicability of evidence Population Studies included children 5 to 17 years old with autistic disorder; majority male. Studies typically included children with cognitive impairment (IQ or DQ 70) and comorbidities including ADHD, ODD, OCD, typically moderate to severe. Use of concomitant medications ranged from none to roughly a third of children in studies . Intervention Stimulants evaluated include different doses of methylphenidate, atomoxetine, and guanfacine . Comparators Placebo Outcomes Studies typically outcomes in the short -term incl uding hyperactivity/inattention, oppositional behavior, and social behaviors. The dose and type of medication were similar to reports in the literature; the duration of treatment across studies was 4 to 28 weeks with evaluation conducted immediately after treatment. Setting Studies were conducted in the US, The MPH trial included drug -free children in 5 academic outpatient clinics in the US and Netherlands , with clinic -based populations ,likely representing a highly selected population. ADHD Compulsive Disor der E-1 Table E -3. Nutritional supplements Domain Description of applicability of evidence Population Studies included children ages 2-11 years with differing requirements for inclusion. Two omega-3 fatty acid studies targeted younger children (ages 3- 8) with hyperactive behavior. The degree of intellectual disability was not well described in the studies. Intervention Nutritional supplements including omega- 3 fatty acids, methyl B -12, peptizyde, docosahex -aenoic acid and levocarnitine. Comparators Comparator for all studies in this group was placebo. Outcomes Study outcomes included behavior, autism severity, communication, cognitive, and gastrointestinal symptoms and sleep disturbances. Data were collected using a wide range of assessment tools including CGI, ABC, CARS, SRS, BASC, GBRS, PDDBI, MCDI, PPVT, Stanford -Binet, -CV, Expressive Vocabulary test, Rescorla Language Development Survey, CBCL, and Childhood Psychiatric Rating Scale. Most studies were of 3 months duration (range 1 to 6 months). Outcomes were collected at end of treatment with no long term follow -up.

Dietary interventions Domain Description of applicability of evidence Population Study participants ranged in age from 2 to 12 years, with no information available about co- morbidities, except one study that included children with severe maladaptive behavior. Severity of autism was not well described and the degree of intellectual disability was not well characterized in most studies. One GFCF study required participants to be concurrently enrolled in a comprehensive ABA program. Use of concomitant medications was not noted in most studies. One study recruited children with known allergies or food intolerances. Intervention Gluten boiled camel milk . Comparators Comparators included gluten and dairy diet, gluten- containig challenge foods, usual diet, placebo and cow milk . Outcomes Outcomes included autism severity scores, problem behaviors including maladaptive behavior, sleep, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Assessments used in the studies included ADOS, CARS, Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS), Ritvo -Freeman Real Life rating scale s, ADHD-IV scale, Conner's Behavior Rating scale, VABS, Pervasive Developmental Disorder Behavior Inventory, sleep diaries, and Gastrointestinal symptom severity index. Setting Studies were conducted in academic medical centers located in the United Stat es, Belgium, Denmark , Iran, Norway, and Saudi Arabia. CARS -Childhood Autism Rating Scale; ADOS -Autism Diagnostic Observation E -5. Risperidone adjuncts Domain Description of applicability of evidence compared to question Population Studies typically included participants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) recruited from non- primary care populations (university/academic -affiliated clinics, research centers), which may limit applicability to the wider population; participants had an average age in a range between 3- 16 years and included 17-23 subjects in the treatment arm to 14-24 in the placebo arm with more male subjects (73% in treatment groups and 75% in control). Three studies reported including subjects with cognitive impairment while majority did not mention the intellectual disability status. Most of the studies included subjects with severe disruptive symptoms and typically did not report comorbidity status or use of concomitant medications or therapies. Intervention Comparators Studies compared adjuncts to risperidone therapy to placebo added to risperidone. Outcomes Studies primarily targeted outcomes related to core and associated behavior symptoms (irritability, hyperactivity, lethargy/withdrawal, stereotypy and inappropriate speech) which are significant concerns in the ASD population along with global clinical improvement. Outcome measures used to assess change were appropriate; although the duration of studies was typically 10 weeks and evaluation was typically immediately post -treatment. Setting All the studies were conducted in Iran and primarily in academic clinics or research centers which may have yielded more selected populations. ASD -autsim spectrum disorder Table E-6. Combination medical and behavioral treatments Domain Description of applicability of evidence Population Studies included children between 3 and 14 years old. Across studies ASD symptoms were generally considered mild to moderate. In one study of atomoxetine plus parent training, children had concomitant ADHD symptoms. Intervention Atomoxetine plus/minus parent training, bumetanide plus applied behavioral analysis; cord blood or stem cell transplantation plus rehabilitation therapy; melatonin plus/minus cognitive behavioral therapy; folic acid plus TEACCH. Comparators Behavioral therapy alone, placebo. Outcomes Most studies assessed challenging behaviors (e.g., irritability, inattention, oppositional behavior) and symptom severity; one study evaluated cognitive skills and one evaluated sleep outcomes. Setting Studies were conducted in China, the US, an d Italy and were recruited from research centers or clinics. ADHD -Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder; ASD -autsim spectrum of Autistic and Communication -Related Handicapped Children E-3 Table E -7.

Other --Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Domain Description of applicability of evidence Population Studies included children ages 2-14 years with autism. The degree of disease severity was not well categorized. Participants were overwhelmingly male in the two studies that reported gender (84% and 93%) The degree of intellectual disability was not repor ted in any of the studies. Concomitant behavioral and medication interventions were reported in all studies. Intervention Hyperbaric oxygen therapy - dosages ranged from 24% to 100% oxygen . Comparators Comparators for these studies included treatments of room air, sham air and free air flow. Outcomes Study outcomes included autism severity and change in behavior. Assessment tools used in the studies included CGI (used in all three trials), ATEC, ADOS, SRS, ABC. VABS, VMI -5, BRIEF, PPVT -III, RBS and direct observation of toy play sessions. The number of treatment sessions ranged from 20 up to 80 one hour treatments occurring over a three up to 15 week period of time.

Other --Bumetanide Domain Description of applicability of evidence Population Study participants ranged in age from 3 to 11 years with a wide range of disease severity among study participants. The Chinese study was restricted to younger children (2.5 to 6.5 years) who were concurrently enrolled in an ABA program. The degree of intellectual disability was not described. Concomitant medications were stopped prior to study entry in both studies. The placebo -controlled trial did allow use of melatonin. Intervention Bumetanide , 1 mg dose Comparators Placebo and no medical treatment in one study in which all participants were receiving ABA. Outcomes Outcomes included autism severity scores and symptoms. Assessments used in the studies included CARS, CGI, ADOS -G and ABC scales. Both studies were of 3 months duration. The placebo controlled trial also assessed subjects after a one month wash-out period post - intervention. Setting One placebo -controlled trial was conducted in France and the other study was done in China.

Other --Donepezil Domain Description of applicability of evidence Population Studies included children 2 to 17 years old with autistic disorder; with majority being male children (>90%). One study reported a total ADOS score ranging from 10.2 to 11.2; with IQ ranging from 73-146 while the other did not exclude children based on intelligence or language development level. Studies allowed use of concomitant medications but did not include children with co- morbid conditions. Intervention The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor u sed was donepezil hydrochloride. Comparators The trial included a placebo controlled comparison group, which was an appropriate comparison group . Outcomes The trials ranged from 10 to 12 weeks in duration with the evaluation conducted immediately after treatment. Studies assessed outcomes in the short -term including expressive, receptive language, autistic behaviors and cognitive functioning. The dose used was similar to reports in the literature; treatment episodes were most commonly associated with mood swings, lability, diarrhea, headache and fatigue as side effects. One trial also evaluated the effect of age, IQ and autism severity on treatment response and found no significant group difference. Setting Both the trials were conducted in USA.
