Prioritization of target populationsRoadmap towards prioritization of target populations Key assumptions: Vaccines are licensed and meet all minimum criteria of WHO TPP; Vaccines have at least minimal level efficacy in older age groups; idem for other subpopulations; NPI continue to be used; Vaccine effect on transmission less relevant for early scenarios, but information becomes available at some point; No account has been taken of seroprevalence and the possible degree of population protection already established.To support country planning, the Roadmap suggests public health strategies and target priority groups for different levels of vaccine availability in different epidemiologic settings https://www.who.int/groups/strategic example for community transmission Speed, Scale, Access103. WHO interim recommendation for the use of mRNA BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) Announced on Jan. 5th Publication of interim https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/338484/WHO -2019 -nCoV -vaccines - SAGE_recommendation -BNT162b2- mRNA BNT162b2 (Pfizer- BioNTech) (1/2) BNT162b2 has been shown to have an efficacy of 95% against symptomatic SARS- CoV-2 infection. No data are available related to impact on transmission or viral shedding. Vaccination is recommended for persons aged 16 years and above. The recommended schedule is two doses given intramuscularly with an interval of 21- 28 days between the doses. The need for flexibility in the schedule was acknowledged and current data support an extension up to 42 days. The same product should be used for both doses. There are no studies on interchangeability with other vaccines against COVID -19 . 11WHO interim recommendation for the use of mRNA BNT162b2 (Pfizer -BioNTech) (2/2): Vaccination of specific populations BNT162b2 is not a live vaccine, the mRNA does not enter the nucleus and is rapidly degraded. Animal studies show no toxicity to the fetus, but no data on safety in pregnant women exist. SAGE recommends not to use BNT162b2 in pregnancy until more data are available, except in circumstances where the benefit of vaccinating a pregnant woman outweighs the risks, such as in health workers at high risk of exposure or women with significant comorbidities. Vaccination can be offered to breastfeeding women if part of risk group, and WHO does not recommend discontinuation of breastfeeding after vaccination. Vaccination can be offered to people living with HIV in accordance to the prioritization roadmap12 12134.
