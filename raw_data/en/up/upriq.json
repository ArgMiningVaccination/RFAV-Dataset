Hindus believe that illness and health-related issues may result from their karma in this or past lifetimes. Illness and difficult situations provide the opportunity to purify the karma and evolve spiritually. Essential Practice Point 2 - Some Hindus may follow the traditional Hindu system of medicine known as ayurveda, which treats imbalances with meditation, diet, exercise and herbal remedies. Some may prefer to continue these practices while undergoing western medical treatment. - Check if the person is taking herbal remedies and determine if the content conflicts with any prescribed medication. (Return to [Summary of Essential Practice Points](/eng/services/publications/socialinclusion/interculturalguide/hinduism/summary.html)) Religious contacts Essential Practice Point 3 - Presently there are no Hindu priests in Ireland who can lead religious practices. Hence, it is advised to seek the name of a family or community contact who can attend to traditional rituals if needed and particularly in relation to death. - Three Hindu contacts have agreed to provide guidance and religious services related to death if requested by the person or family. Their names are provided at the [end of the section.](/eng/services/publications/socialinclusion/interculturalguide/hinduism/contact.html) (Return to [Summary of Essential Practice Points](/eng/services/publications/socialinclusion/interculturalguide/hinduism/summary.html)) Religious practices - Religious practices may include prayer, meditation and the reading of scripture. A small picture or statue of a Deity may be used in prayer or a mantra (a sound vibration representing an aspect of the Divine) may be recited on a mala (prayer beads strung together). Some may wish to face North or East during religious practice. These practices do not need any specific accommodation from the healthcare setting unless a specific request is made. Food and the content of medicine Essential Practice Point 4 - Food requirements need to be discussed with the person and provision made to source culturally appropriate food, as necessary. - Vegetarianism is recommended in Hindu scriptures and is widespread in India. - Hindus are free to choose their own diet and many eat some types of meat. Beef should not be offered to a Hindu as the cow is sacred to Hindus. Some will not eat pork. - Spices and salt are commonly used, yoghurt and sweets taken with meals and ghee (clarified butter) is used instead of oil in cooking. - Eating with the right hand, without cutlery, is the traditional method, while in Ireland eating with cutlery is considered acceptable. - A person should be advised if medication contains animal products so that they can make a choice about whether to use the medicine or not.

The bed-bound may request water for washing before prayer, before eating and possibly after toileting. - Most are likely to wash before prayer and before eating. - Traditionally people wash after toileting, although in the West people may prefer to use toilet paper. - Those of Asian origin tend to showers for daily washing and some may prefer to use running water rather than a bath to wash if a shower facility is not available. Gender issues and modesty - Hindus may adhere to traditional modesty observances common among people of Asian origin. Both men and women may prefer to be as covered as much as possible during a physical examination and may prefer a physical examination to be as private as possible. - Women are increasingly being treated by male medical personnel in India and are unlikely to request a female practitioner. Family dynamics, decision making and community visits Essential Practice Point 5 - Cultural norms in India relating to extended family bonds, community bonds, respect for elders and respect for private space have implications for how all Hindus of Indian ethnicity will behave in healthcare settings. - The person may wish to consult family members in the making of any medical decisions, such as whether or not to operate, and some may expect to be automatically involved in decision making. (Return to [Summary of Essential Practice Points](/eng/services/publications/socialinclusion/interculturalguide/hinduism/summary.html)) - A woman may wish to consult her husband about medical decisions in line with traditional norms in India. - Family and community will visit an ill person, sometimes in large numbers and these may need to be managed. - When visiting an older relative the visitor may stand until invited to sit by his/her elder. - In India a person normally removes their shoes before entering a home, a place of worship, and certain other places. Hindu visitors may choose to remove their shoes before entering the ill person's private space (room, cubicle, etc.). - Most Hindus speak English but use their native language with others who speak the same language or dialect. Hindi is the major mother tongue of most Hindus. Blood Transfusion and Organ Transplantation Selfless giving is a virtuous act in Hinduism. Hindus therefore are likely to be extremely grateful for blood transfusion or organ transplantation. "}
