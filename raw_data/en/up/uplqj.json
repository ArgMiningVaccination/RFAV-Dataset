For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Suspension for injection (injection) White to off -white suspension (pH 7.5 \u00b1 0.5 ) 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications COVID -19 Vaccine (i nactivated, adjuvanted ) Valneva is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS -CoV -2 in individuals 18 to 5 0 years of age . The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Primary series Individuals 18 to 50 years of age COVID -19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva is administered intramuscularly as a course of 2 doses of 0.5 mL each. The second dose should be administered 28 days after the first dose (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). There are no data available on the interchangeability of COVID -19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva with other COVID- 19 vaccines to complete the vaccination course. Individuals who have received the first dose of COVID -19 Va ccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva should receive the dose of COVID- 19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva to complete the vaccination course. Booster dose A booster dose of 0.5 ml may be given to individuals who completed the primary vaccination course with COVID- 19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva or an adenoviral vector -based COVID -19 vaccine (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). The booster dose should be administered at least 8 months after completing the primary vaccination course. Paediatric population The safety and immunogeni city of COVID- 19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva in children and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not yet been established. No data are available. Elderly population The safety and immunogenicity of COVID -19 Vaccine Valneva in individuals 65 years of age have not yet been established. Very limited data are currently available in individuals over 50 years of age. See also sections 4.8. Method of administration COVID -19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva should be administered intramuscularly . The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm (preferably the non- dominant arm). Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally. The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. For instructions on the handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or yeast - derived residues (i.e. yeast DNA, yeast antigens and mannosylated rHA) of the manufacturing process of the recombinant human albumin (rHA). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the a dministered product should be clearly recorded. Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis Events of anaphylaxis have been reported with COVID -19 vaccines. A ppropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of anaphylactic reac tion following administration of the vaccine . Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. A second dose of the vaccine should not be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to the first dose of COVID- 19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva. Anxiety- related related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. Concurrent illness Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infe ction and/or low -grade fever should not delay vaccination. Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution to individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. Immunocompromised individuals The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine have not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of COVID- 19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva may be lower in immunosuppressed individuals . Duration of protection The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical stu dies. Limitations of vaccine effectiveness Individuals may not be fully protected until 14 days after their second dose. As with all vaccines, vaccination with COVID- 19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva may not protect all vaccine recipients (see section 5.1) . Excipients Potassium This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per 0.5 mL dose, that is to say essentially 'potassium -free'. Sodium This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 mL dose , that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of COVID- 19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva with other vaccines has not been studied. 4.6 Fertility, p regnancy and lactation Pregnancy There is no experience with use of COVID- 19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post -natal development (see section 5.3). Administration of COVID- 19 Vaccine (ina ctivated, adjuvanted) Valneva in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus. 5 Breast -feeding It is unknown whether COVID -19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted, adsorbed) Valneva is excreted in human milk. Fertility Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines COVID -19 Vaccine (inactivated, ad juvanted) Valneva has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The safety of COVID -19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva (VLA2001) was evaluated from an interim analysis of an ongoing study in the United Kingdom in adult healthy participants (or with a stable medical condition) aged 18 years and older. 2,972 subjects were randomized to receive either VLA2001 (n=1,977) or the comparator AZD1222 (n=995) in a blinded manner, while 1,040 subjects from 18 -30 years of age received open label VLA2001. The median age of the participants was 33 years, with less than 1% above 50 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions in the pivotal studies were injection site tenderness (76,4%), fatigue ( 57,3%), The majority of adverse reactions were mild and resolved within 2 days of vaccination. The incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar after the first and second doses. They tended to decrease with age. After a booste r dose, the tolerability profile was similar to that observed after the first and second dose. The most frequent reported adverse reactions were injection site tenderness (57,3 %), injection site pain (35.0%), fatigue (32.0%), muscle headache (22.5%), nausea/vomiting (6.4%), and fever/body temperature (2.0%). The majority of adverse reactions were mild and resolved within 2 days of vaccination. A booster dose with VLA2001 was safe and well tolerated regardless of which priming VLA2001 or COVI D-19 had been received previously. Tabulated list of adverse reactions Adverse reactions reported are listed per MedDRA system organ class and according to the following frequency categories: Very common ( 1/10) Common ( ( 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) Very rare (< 1/10,000) Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 6 Table 1.

It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are ask ed to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V and include batch/ lot number if available . 4.9 Overdose No case of overdose has been reported in the clinical studies . In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Viral vaccines, other viral vaccines , ATC code: J07BX03 Mechanism of action 7 COVID Valneva (VLA2001) is a purified, inactivated, SARS -CoV -2 (Wuhan strain hCoV -19/Italy/INMI1 -isl/2020) vaccine grown on Vero cells. The vaccine manufacturing process makes the virus unable to replicate and delivers intact spike proteins on the vir us surface. Adjuvant s are added to increase the magnitude of vaccine -mediated immune responses. Following administration, VLA2001 induces SARS -CoV -2 neutrali sing antibodies, as well as cellular immune responses (Th1) directed against the spike and other surface proteins, which may contribute to protection against COVID -19. Using this vaccine, the cellular immune response is thus not limited to the S -protein but als o directed against other SARS -CoV -2 surface antigens. No data on induction of humoral immune responses directed against SARS -CoV-2 antigens other than S -protein are available in humans. Pharmacodynamic effects Immunogenicity 19 Vaccine ( VLA2001) has been inferred by immunobridging of immune responses to the authorized ChAdOx1- S (recombinant) COVID- 19 vector vaccine , for which vaccine efficacy has been established. Primary series The immunogenic ity of COVID -19 vaccine Valneva as a primary series was evaluated in one randomi sed, observer -blind, active- controlled, Phase 3 safety and immunogenicity s tudy (VLA2001- 301) conducted in the UK. The study compared VLA2001 with an authorised COVID -19 vector vaccine (ChAdOx1- S [recombinant]) () in adults, including those with stable medical condition s. In total 2, 975 participants aged 30 years we re randomised ( 2:1) to receive either a 2 -dose immunisation schedule of VLA2001 (n=1,978) or COVID- 19 Vaccine S [recombinant]) (n=997), each given 28 days apart . Additional ly, 1,0 42 participants aged 18 - 29 years were enrolled in a non- randomised treatment group to receive VLA2001 in an open- label fashion . The immunogenicity population (IMM) include d all randomised and vaccinated participants who were SARS -CoV -2 seronegative and had at least one evaluable post -vaccination antibody titre measurement . Samples from 990 participants who were seronegative at baseli ne were analysed. The m ean age in the IMM population was approximately 36 years and both groups included more male than female participants (55.3% vs. 44.3% in the VLA group, 58.8% vs. 41.2% in the ChAdOx1- S [recombinant] group). The majority in both treat ment groups w as white (95.1% in the VLA group, 93.6% in the ChAdOx1- S [recombinant] group). The per protocol (PP) population comprised of all IMM -population participants who had no major protocol violations that impacted the immune response ( n=489 VLA2001 and n=498 COVID- . Based on the SARS -CoV -2-specific neutralising antibodies at two weeks after the second dose (Day 43), t he co -primary objectives were to demonstrate i) superiority for VLA2001 vs. comparator for geometric mean titres (GMT s) in the IMM population and ii) non -inferiority for the seroconversion rates (defined as a 4 -fold increase from baseline) ofin adults aged 30 years and older ( PP population ). Table 1 shows GMT s of neutralizing antibodies on Day 43 in the I MM population. All participants included in this analysis had baseline ND 50 values below the limit of detection. 8 Table 1 : SARS -CoV -2 neutralising antibodies (ND 50) on Day 1 and Day 43; co-primary analysis (IMM population) Treatment Confidence interval 1 p-value and CI calculated using a two- sided t -test applied to log10 transformed data Table 2 shows seroconversion rates on Day 43 in the PP population. Table 2 : Proportion of participants with seroconversion in terms of neutralising antibodies on Day 43 (PP population) Treatment group VLA2001 (N=492) COVID-19 [recombinan t]) (n=498) Overall (N=990) Number of patients with eligible samples at visit 456 449 905 Participants with seroconversion at Day 43 n Exact 95% Clopper -Pearson confidence interval for proportion. 2 P value or two- sided CI is for the difference in proportions (VLA2001- COVID -19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1- S [recombinant])) of participants with seroconversion at each particular visit. For the the s econdary endpoint of fold increases in GMTs at Day 43 compared to baseline , these were 25.9 (95%CI: 24.14, (p <0.0001) (IMM population , result s in PP population similar ). Similar to the neutralising antibodies, a higher GMT of S -protein binding antibodies (IgG ELISA) was observed at Day 43 in the VLA2001 group (GMT 2,361.7 (95%CI: 2,171.08, PP population similar ). At Day 43, seroconversion in terms of S-protein binding (ChAdOx1- [recombinant]) (IMM population, results in PP population similar ). Numbers of p articipants with 2-fold, 10-fold and 20-fold increase in S -9 protein binding antibody titre at Day 43 were similar for both treatment groups with nearly 100% for 2-fold increase and 90% or more for 10-fold and 20-fold increase . Cellular immune response was demonstrated by VLA2001 induc ing broad T -cell responses with antigen- specific interferon -gamma producing T -cells reactive (defined as normalised spot forming units 6 in an interferon gamma T -cell ELISpot test) against the full sequenc e spike protein in 74.3%, against nucleocapsid protein in 45.9% and against membrane protein in 20.3% of the participants as assessed in the PBMC subset of the IMM population at Day 43 (results in PP population similar ). Antibody responses measured after a single VLA2001 vaccination were lower when compared to two VLA2001 vaccinations. This indicate s that the second vaccination with VLA2001 is necessary to induce robust antibody levels in baseline negative participants . At a mean observation time of 151 days, 87 (8.4%) symptomatic COVID- 19 cases (exploratory endpoint) occurred in participants 18- 29 years and 139 (7%) in participants 30 years who received two doses of VLA2001. 60 (6%) cases occurred in participants who received two doses of COVID- 19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1 -S [recombinant]) . All symptomatic COVID -19 cases were assessed as mild or moderate by the investigator and none of the COVID -19 cases were severe. Booster dose The safety and immunogenicity of a single booster dose of VLA2001 was evaluated in the booster part of study VLA2001- 301 in participants aged 18 years . A total of 958 participants (n=712 given VLA2001 and n=246 given COVID -19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1- S [recombinant]) as a primary course received a booster dose with VLA2001 approximately 8 months after completing the 2- dose primary series. Tables 3 and 4 summarise the Geometric Mean Fold Rises (GMFR s) in SARS -CoV -2-specific neutralising antibodies at 14 days after booster vaccination compared with pre -boost (Table 3) or compared with Day 43 on study, i.e. 2 weeks after the second dose of the primary series (Table 4). Neutralising antibodies titres increased in both VLA2001 -primed and COVID -19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1- S [recombinant])- primed participants from pre -boost to 2- weeks post -boost and titres were higher 2 weeks after the booster dose compared to 2 weeks after the second dose of the primary series (i.e. Day 43).

All symptomatic COVID- 19 cases were assessed as mild or moderate by the investigator and none of the COVID -19 cases w as severe. Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with COVID -19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of COVID -19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproduction and development al toxicity conducted. Repeat dose toxicity Intramuscular administration of the vaccine on three occasions at 2 weekly intervals (Days 1, 15 and 29) was well tolerated in rats. The study showed microscopic findings that were still evident after a 3- week treatment free period, but with reduced incide nces in the administration sites and spleen compared to before the treatment free period, indicating partial recovery. The observations would be considered physiological and immunological responses to the vaccine. Genotoxicity/carcinogenicity Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine are not expected to have genotoxic potential. Reproductive toxicity A reproductive toxicity trial studying VLA2001 in female Han Wistar rats demonstrated that VLA2001 did not affect the reproductive parameters, the delivery and foetal development . No data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. 11 6.
