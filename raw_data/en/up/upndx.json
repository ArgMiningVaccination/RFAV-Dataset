Why is Children's Minnesota requiring COVID -19 vaccinations? The increased number of COVID -19 infections in the community, being driven by highly transmissible variants, is concerning to health care organizations. As the kid expert s in the region, it is our collective duty to deliver the safest care possible to the kids and families we serve, and to protect kids in our communities against COVID . COVID vaccines are a safe and effective public health measure, proven to help prevent death and to reduce severe illness from COVID. There is currently no COVID vaccine approved for children younger than 12 years old, who make up a large portion of our population. By getting vaccinated against COVID we can help protect all kids, and their families, from becoming severely ill or from dying from COVID. COVID -19 vaccines help protect you and your family from becoming severely ill or dying from COVID. If I volunteer remotely, do I need to get the COVID-19 vaccine? Yes, all volunteers are required to get vaccinated against COVID -19, even if you are volunteering remotely. We are one Children's Minnesota. We all have a personal responsibility to protect the well - being of kids in our communities by being vaccinated to help prevent the spread of CO VID. What if I have had COVID-19? Will Children's accept documentation of a positive PCR test? Can antibodies be used as proof of immunity to COVID -19? No. Immunity after COVID -19 infection is variable depending on the severity of COVID illness and is shorter lived. Immunity after COVID vaccine is consistently very robust and lasts longer than immunity after COVID infection. Vaccination offers long lasting protection against severe illness and death from COVID, and is recommended for people who have had COVID in the past. Why is the COVID- 19 vaccine required but not the influenza vaccination? In deciding which vaccines to require, we have considered the transmissibility of the illness, the risk to patients or staff if they become ill, and the relative effectiveness of vaccines and other preventive measures. With the spread of the COVID Delta variant, universal vaccination of all staff appears to be the optimal way to balance those considerations and ensure patients and staff are protected. At this time, we will continue to encourage, but not require, seasonal influenza vaccine. Why is the vaccine being required when it's still under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)? The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) refers to the authority the FDA has to authorize use of medications and devices in response to public health emergencies and pandemics. The EUA expedited the availability of vaccines after they successfully demonstrated safety in phase II studies and efficacy in phase III studies. Rather than require the studies to conclude their full two-year observation period, the products were approved after demonstrating efficacy after at least si x months of data. Continued on- going evaluation of the vaccines following the phased distribution to the public reiterated the safety profiles established in the phase II and III studies and clarified potential risks associated with very rare adverse event s, including allergy to vaccine components, risk for clotting factors, and possible association to neurologic symptoms such as Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS). In addition to being ver y rare, these adverse events are known to and occur with greater frequency in individuals infected COVID -19 virus. COVID remains an on -going threat to our community. There is evidence that vaccination can reduce the viral load and shorten the time of illness in those exposed to the virus, if not prevent development of illness completely. Children's Minnesota is requiring COVID vaccination for employees both to protect the patients and families we care for, and to ensure that our staff are protected from developing severe disease and being unable to work. Just as we require st aff to be vaccinated or demonstrate that they are protected against a variety of other vaccine preventable diseases (Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Pertussis, Diphtheria, Hepatitis B, Varicella, tetanus, and, for some, Meningitis) so we added COVID -19 as the newest vaccine preventable disease as a component of health care workplace safety.
