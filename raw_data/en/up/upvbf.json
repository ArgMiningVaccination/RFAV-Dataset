Page 2 of 6Observational Study of Immunogenicity of Fluzone\u00ae (Influenza Virus Vaccine) in Younger and Older Adults5Older adults have a lower immune response to influenza vaccine compared with younger adults In an observational study of the immunogenicity of Fluzone vaccine, younger patients (median: 38 years of age; range: 19 through 59 years of age) and older adults (median: 72 years of age; range: 61 through 86 years of age) were evaluated. Results were obtained after vaccination with a single dose of the 2000-2001 formulation of Fluzone vaccine.Lower immune response to Fluzone vaccine in older adults Please click here to see Important Safety Information.

Pre-specifi ed statistical superiority criteria required that (1) the lower limit (LL) of the 2-sided 95% confi dence interval (CI) of the GMT ratio of Fluzone High-Dose vaccine to Fluzone vaccine be greater than 1.50 for at least 2 of the strains, and if 1 strain failed, noninferiority of that strain must be demonstrated (LL>0.67), and that (2) the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the seroconversion rate difference between Fluzone High-Dose and Fluzone vaccines be greater than 10% for at least 2 of the strains, and if 1 strain failed, noninferiority of that strain must be demonstrated (LL>-10%). b Seroconversion: Paired samples with pre-vaccination HI titer post-vaccination (day 28) titer increase for those with pre-vaccination titer 1:10.

Important Safety Information Indication Fluzone High-Dose vaccine is an inactivated influenza virus vaccine indicated for active immunization of persons 65 years of age and older against influenza disease caused by influenza virus subtypes A and type B contained in the vaccine. This indication is based on the immune response elicited by Fluzone High-Dose vaccine; there have been no controlled clinical studies demonstrating a decrease in influenza disease after vaccination with Fluzone High-Dose vaccine. Safety Information The most common local and systemic adverse reacti ons to Fluzone High-Dose vaccine include soreness, pain, and swelling at the vaccination site; fever, head ache, malaise, and myalgia. Other adverse reactions may occur. Fluzone High-Dose vaccine should not be administered to anyone with a history of hypersensitivity to any vaccine component, including eggs, and egg produc ts. The decision to give Fluzone High-Dose vaccine should be based on the potential benefits and risks, es pecially if Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome has occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior influenza vaccine. The ti p caps of the prefilled syringes may contain natural rubber latex, which may cause allergic reactions in latex sensitive individuals. Vaccination with Fluzone High-Dose vaccine may not protect all individuals. Before administering Fluzone High-Dose vaccine, please click here to see full Prescribing Information.
