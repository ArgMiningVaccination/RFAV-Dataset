A part of many different inner healing protocols and methods is something that goes by different names. Generally I use the phrase \"Generational Work\", but I've heard Ancestral Cleansing, Bloodline Clearing, among others. As far as I know, it is all based on the idea that the sins of our fathers (and mothers) can negatively impact us today. You can see this the most clearly when there is a strong family history of abuse or alcoholism. Those seem to be the classic cases. It can also be true that there's a family history of poverty or anger or even physical issues. This is theorized to be because an ancestor first started down that path, and for some reason, or for many reasons, their children, grandchildren, etc., carried on this destructive tradition. It can also be more subtle than these examples, such that we can overcome some issue or other, but that it is much more difficult than it should be, and that it's a constant battle. Maybe the people in your bloodline all are very overweight, but you are not. However, it's very difficult for you to maintain your weight, for example. I don't believe that all our sins \"go generational,\" in that they all go on to effect the generations after us. But it seems pretty clear that some do. And that the enemy is often at work in the middle of it. He is ever watching to catch us at our weakest. His job description is to steal, kill, and destroy, and he doesn't seem to ever go on vacation. I'm so glad you asked. I've developed this class to help you address many of the most common issues in the arena of generational work that I've gathered over more than 10 years of investigating for my own use and for that of my clients. I'll walk you through each section step-by-step with sample prayers that you can use. I will give you the tools that you need to see greater freedom come in your life and in the lives of those in your family.* This class is 100% online and can be taken anywhere and at any time. Work at your own pace and when you are ready to do so. *The class is from a Christian perspective, and utilizes visualization or seeing in the Spirit. You will have access to the content of this class for as long as I have this website (theoretically forever, but life is uncertain). You are welcome to take this class if you are not a believer, I will not try and \"convert\" you, but it will be helpful for you if you are comfortable with my Christ-centered worldview.
