Traditional Medicine: A Constant Struggle For Recognition Chiropractic care has been a subject of controversy and intrigue for decades. Despite being educated in understanding the human body and its workings, chiropractors have faced limitations in their ability to recommend medication or prescribe treatments. In this blog, we delve into the historical divide between traditional medicine and chiropractic, examining the challenges faced by chiropractors and their ongoing struggle for recognition within the medical community. Chiropractors have often been referred to as the \"rebels\" of healthcare. Unlike medical doctors, chiropractors lack prescription rights and are compelled to seek alternative solutions to address health issues. Rather than merely handing out medications to treat symptoms, chiropractors are trained to understand the root causes of ailments and focus on holistic approaches to wellness. They aim to keep patients out of doctor's offices and away from excessive prescription medications, ultimately making them a minimal cog in the huge healthcare money-making machine. One of the key arguments against chiropractic care is that veterinarians should be the only ones offering animal adjustments. Critics argue that this creates a conflict of interest, favoring profit margins over the animals' well-being. However, chiropractors defend their expertise, pointing out that their knowledge of biological processes in animals and humans is comparable.

Misunderstanding or misinterpreting situations can lead to complaints that may have little basis in reality. Pet parents play a crucial role in educating themselves about their animal's health.
