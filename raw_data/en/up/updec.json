We researched the top dietitian-recommended picks.", "sitename": "Byrdie", "date": "2018-11-09", "cleaned_text": "Let's get one thing out of the way: When looking for specific supplements to support hair, skin, and nail health, research is limited. The most well-known supplement used to support hair, skin, and nail health is biotin, [an essential B vitamin](https://www.byrdie.com/biotin-for-skin-4801191), meaning humans must obtain it from food (or supplements). For many, biotin is well-tolerated and safe at high doses, but for some, it may cause clinically significant falsely high (or falsely low) laboratory test results. In addition to biotin, look for a formula with B complex supplements or specialized formulas that contain a blend of nutrients known to support hair, skin, and nail health.It's also a good idea to make sure formulas are as simple as possible, focusing on well-known nutrients and avoiding allergens. With this in mind, we conducted hours of research on the best nutritionist-recommended hair, skin, and nail vitamins for women, spanning a range of budgets. After considering dozens of options, we compiled this list. We noted if each option is third-party tested for efficacy, as well as its inactive ingredients. We also researched how easy it is to incorporate the supplement into your daily routine, looking at things like pill size taste, if any, and how many pills are included in a serving size. We then combined these testing insights with our registered dietician nutritionist recommendations to compile a list of the best in show. Ahead, find the best hair, skin, and nail vitamins.

Meet the Expert [Georgia Forsyth](https://www.instagram.com/georgiafors/) is a nutritionist and naturopath based in Sydney, Australia. She's the founder of Cohere Studio, a health and nutrition consultancy that provides qualified advice from nutritionists to its clients. What to Look For Dose Although biotin is water-soluble and does not stay in the body for long, large doses can affect laboratory values. If you're looking to take biotin to support general health or primarily to support hair, skin, or nails it might not be the wisest decision. As always, update your healthcare provider when adding in a new supplement and be on the lookout for side effects. Certifications and Third-Party Testing Any individual or company can bring a new supplement to the market, with no need for proof of safety or efficacy before the sale\u2014which is why it's of the utmost importance to do your own research when shopping for a new product. Opt for companies that independently test their products to verify quality and potency. It is also wise to look for a product that has a \"certified non-GMO\" or \"USDA Organic\" seal for optimal ingredient integrity. Additional or Complementary Nutrients Hair, skin, and nail supplements can contain a variety of ingredients including nutrients that are thought to promote hair, skin, and nail health, such as other B vitamins or herbs. If you're taking prescription medications or other supplements, it is always important to check with your healthcare provider to ensure safety. - Do hair, skin, and nail vitamins work? According to nutritionist Georgia Forsyth, they can work, but it's important to reach for formulas that include specific vitamins and minerals. She recommends looking for products with zinc, [vitamins E](https://www.byrdie.com/vitamin-e-oil-uses)and C, selenium, vitamin B (in particular, niacin and riboflavin), and collagen. - Are hair, skin, and nail vitamins safe? The ingredients that collectively make up most hair, skin, and nail supplements aren't harmful due to each vitamin and mineral being present in a smaller concentration, explains Forsyth. \"However, it's important to be mindful of where your products are sourced,\" she says. \"Look for reputable brands that come backed by experts in the field.\" She also recommends looking out for single-ingredient vitamins in some cases, [such as with zinc](https://www.byrdie.com/zinc-for-skin), in order to be able to monitor exactly how much you're ingesting. Whether a single-ingredient or a multivitamin, she stresses the importance of reading the product instructions thoroughly and checking with a dedicated health professional before integrating any new supplement into your routine. - Can you take hair, skin, and nail vitamins with prenatal vitamins? When it comes to mixing beauty supplements with [prenatal vitamins](https://www.byrdie.com/best-prenatal-vitamins-5080669), it really depends on each product's formula. \"It's best to consult with your healthcare practitioner if you're expecting or wanting to conceive,\" says Forsyth. - Can you take hair, skin, and nail vitamins with a multivitamin? In the case of [mixing them with multivitamins](https://www.byrdie.com/best-multi-vitamins-for-women), Forsyth says it's typically safe to take both at the same time. \"There generally is no real harm in upping the ante; however, the body is only able to metabolize, store, and absorb so many nutrients at a time,\" she says. \"An overdosage of a specific vitamin or mineral will not increase your results. Instead, you'll just flush it out (and it will essentially go to waste).\" - How often should you take hair, skin, and nail vitamins? When it comes to taking beauty supplements, Forsyth suggests taking them every day for maximum results. \"However, if you notice any side effects or your skin is having an averse reaction, it may be best to take a break or call it quits,\" she says. She also mentions the importance of getting familiar with the label of your chosen supplement. \"This will break down specific ingredients, the correct dosage, and how long you'll need to keep it up until you start to see results,\" she says.
