Here are some that experts recommend\u2014and some they're not so keen on. Ginseng The name ginseng actually applies to a variety of herbs including Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng) and American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius). Ginseng root has been used for centuries to treat a number of health concerns, including to boost immune function and for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. \"Taking ginseng can prevent the flu, but it does not treat the illness once a person has it,\" says [Catherine Uram](https://druram.com), MD, a physician specializing in integrative medicine. Ginseng is available in whole root, extract, powder, tablet, capsule, and tea form. And make sure you never ignore these 6 common [flu symptoms](https://www.thehealthy.com/cold-flu/flu-symptoms/).

Feel free to drink water, juices, and [electrolyte drinks](https://www.thehealthy.com/hydration/electrolyte-drinks/).

Elderberry soup [Elderberries](https://www.thehealthy.com/alternative-medicine/elderberry-syrup/)\u2014the dried berries of the European Elder tree\u2014deliver vitamins A, B, and C and may stimulate the immune system. This natural flu remedy is believed to help speed up recovery and prevent the flu but the evidence isn't strong, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH). (A study published in 2016 in the journal Nutrients, however, suggests taking [elderberry supplements can reduce cold symptoms and duration](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848651/).) \"Elderberry extracts have been shown to decrease the duration of flu infection\u2014it does the same for many upper respiratory infections,\" says Dr. Horwitz, who recommends taking it as a syrup, extract, or lozenge. Elderberry soup can be found in many health food stores and online. Apple cider vinegar People often tout [apple cider vinegar](https://www.thehealthy.com/home-remedies/apple-cider-vinegar-benefits/) as a natural flu remedy when mixed with water and taken every three hours (one tablespoon in 8 ounces of water). That's because the vinegar is believed to have \"antibacterial and antiviral properties, and be useful for sore throat,\" says Dr. Horwitz. But he isn't among the believers. \"Although used by several of my patients\u2014I don't use this much,\" he says.

Common forms of ginger include the fresh or dried root, tablets, capsules, liquid extracts, and teas. Honey \"Honey has been shown in studies to be effective at relieving a cough and sore throat,\" says Dr. Horwitz. One review of studies published in 2017 in the journal Pharmacognosy Research shows that [honey's antibacterial and antimicrobial properties](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5424551/) make it an effective treatment for a wide range of conditions. Apart from its powers to soothe a scratchy throat, however, \"honey has not been shown to be specifically effective against the flu,\" notes Dr. Horwitz.

Oscillococcinum Proponents say that this homeopathic remedy may help with flu-like symptoms such as body aches, fever, headaches, chills, and fatigue. A review of studies published in 2015 in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, however, found insufficient evidence supporting Oscillococcinum as a treatment for the flu. However, the researchers found [no harm in taking the supplement](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6726585/). \"Although it is safe and widely used, I tend to use other treatments preferentially,\" says Dr. Horwitz. Olive leaf extract The phytochemical oleuropein, the main component of olive leaf extract, contains [antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and antiviral properties](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392257/), according to a review of studies published in 2017 in the journal Oncotarget.
