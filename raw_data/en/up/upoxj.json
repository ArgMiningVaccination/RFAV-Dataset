It starts with subtle signs like difficulty in focusing, poor recalling abilities, feeling low quite often, and changes in appetite. Most of the people tend to ignore these signs, till it manifests as a clinical illness and can have serious health implications. Depression is a complex disorder most likely triggered by overlapping biological, psychological, and environmental factors. It is much more common than we think and anyone can suffer from depression, even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances. Depression is not something to be embarrassed or ashamed about. It is a bodily disorder and needs medical intervention like any other disease. Timely and right medical treatment along with self care can go a long way in managing it. So speak up, treating depression as a taboo will only make matters worse. "}
