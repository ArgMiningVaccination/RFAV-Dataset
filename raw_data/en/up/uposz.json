Introduction (1) Biomedical waste is one of the many types of wastes regulated by the Ministry of the Environment through the Environmental Protection Act. This guideline details the Ministry of the Environment's (\"Ministry\") expectations for the management of that waste. Although biomedical waste is estimated to represent less than ten percent of the waste generated by the health care field, it poses risks to public health and the environment and therefore, must be segregated and managed accordingly. The guideline is primarily directed at two main audiences: (1) generators of biomedical waste; and (2) carriers and receivers who are responsible for treatment, transportation and disposal of biomedical waste. For generators, this guideline describes best management practices to be followed to minimize the impact of biomedical waste on the environment through appropriate packaging, segregation, treatment, storage and disposal methods. For carriers and receivers of biomedical waste, in addition to describing best management practices, the guideline will in part inform the Ministry's review of applications for certificates of approval for waste management systems and waste disposal sites under Part V of the Environmental Protection Act and the setting of conditions of approval. The underlying purpose of this guideline is preserving the integrity of the environment and reducing potential public health risk through proper management of biomedical waste. Everyone involved in the generation and management of this waste has a role to play, and can reduce its impact on the environment through the adoption of these best management practices. Scope (2) This guideline is intended for use by generators (sections 4 through 7), carriers (section 7) and receivers (section 8) of biomedical waste and by the Ministry's Environmental Assessment and Approvals Branch. This document will assist the reader in determining the best practices for the management biomedical waste. The recommendations set out in this guideline are in addition to any requirements under Part V of the EPA, Regulation 347 (General - Waste Management), and any other statutory or legal requirements. Generators, carriers and receivers of biomedical waste must comply with this legislation and all other applicable legislation and subordinate instruments. Although the recommendations in the guideline are likely to apply in most circumstances, it is the responsibility of those handling biomedical waste to assess and take any additional precautions that are appropriate in the specific circumstances. Although not specifically listed below, other generators and handlers of biomedical waste, such as police, fire, and ambulance services, and pharmacies are encouraged to use these guidelines when formulating their best management practices.

On-Site Management of Biomedical Waste by Generators (4) On-Site Management of Biomedical Waste by Generators (4.1) Specific Requirements Biomedical waste should be segregated from all other waste and handled in accordance with the containment, labelling and storage requirements in Tables 4A and 4B, and sections 4.2 and 4.3. |Waste Category||Containment||Container Label||Refrigeration Storage at or below 4\u00b0C| Indicates reusable container (see Indicates waste should be refrigerated at all times|| Indicates waste should be refrigerated if being stored for a period greater than 4 |human anatomical waste||||Red||Anatomical symbol||| |animal anatomical waste||||Red||Anatomical symbol||| |human animal anatomical waste (fixed in formaldehyde or other preservative)| * Note: Waste fixed in formaldehyde or other preservative should be decanted prior to disposal. |Waste Category||Containment||Container Label||Refrigeration Storage at or below 4\u00b0C| | Indicates sharps container acceptable|| Indicates reusable sharps container acceptable||Label colour||Label (see appendix 1)|| Indicates waste should be refrigerated at all times|| Indicates waste should be refrigerated where it is likely to be stored for a period exceeding 48 hours| |sharps waste||||||Yellow||Universal Biohazard symbol| |Cytotoxic sharps waste||||||Red||Cytotoxic symbol| Containment and Packaging (4.2) In addition to the requirements set out in Tables 4A and 4B, biomedical waste should be segregated from all other wastes and immediately deposited into an appropriate single use or reusable container that conforms to the minimum standards described in this section. Biomedical Waste Containers (Non Sharps Waste) The following are the minimum standards for a single use and reusable biomedical waste containers, other than a container for sharps waste. Single Use Biomedical Waste Containers The container consists of: - an unlined rigid and leak proof plastic drum or pail, or - an outer cardboard container that can be sealed and is lined with a liner made of a leak proof plastic film that can be securely tied. The container must also be: - capable of withstanding the weight of the biomedical waste without tearing, cracking, crushing, breaking or otherwise allowing the accidental release or discharge of the waste, and - colour coded and clearly marked as specified in Table 4A. Reusable Biomedical Waste Containers A container that is: - fabricated of a puncture resistant and leak proof material that can be cleaned and disinfected prior to reuse, - capable of withstanding the weight of the biomedical waste without tearing, cracking, crushing, breaking or otherwise allowing the accidental release or discharge of the waste, and - is visually inspected for tears, cracks, breaks or leaks every time it is emptied. A reusable container is not an appropriate container for biomedical wastes destined to be incinerated. Biomedical Waste Containers (Sharps Waste) The following are the minimum standards for a single use and reusable biomedical waste containers for sharps waste. Single-Use Sharps Waste Containers A single-use sharps container should: - be made of rigid materials that are puncture resistant and leak resistant, and - have a lid which cannot be removed after the container is sealed. Re-usable Sharps Waste Containers A reusable sharps container should: be made of rigid materials that are puncture resistant and leak resistant, - have a lid that is securely attached to the container that can be closed and locked when the container is full, and - designed or intended by the manufacturer to be suitable for reprocessing and reuse. Central Storage of Biomedical Waste On Site (4.3) Storage In addition to the storage requirements of Tables 4A and 4B, biomedical waste should be stored in an area that is: - secure, not accessible to the general public, and not adjacent to supply storage areas or areas used for food preparation or consumption, - refrigerated or is itself a refrigeration or freezer unit, where refrigeration of the waste is required in accordance with Table 4A or 4B, and - clearly marked with the Universal biohazard symbol (see Appendix 1). Technologies for the Treatment and Disposal of Biomedical Waste On Site (5) Incineration (5.1) It is recommended that the following biomedical wastes be incinerated if treated at the site where the waste was generated: - human anatomical waste, - animal anatomical waste, - cytotoxic waste, - waste that has come into contact with human blood waste that is infected or suspected of being infected with an infectious substance (human), and - waste that has come into contact with animal blood waste. The following Ministry of the Environment guidelines (available on the [Ministry's website](http://www.ene.gov.on.ca)) outline the minimum design and emissions criteria for incineration and should be followed: - Guideline A-1: Combustion, Air Pollution Control and Monitoring Requirements for Biomedical Waste Incinerators in Ontario (October 2002), as amended. - Guideline A-8: Guideline for the Implementation of Canada-wide Standards for Emissions of Mercury and of Dioxins and Furans and Monitoring and Reporting Requirements for Municipal Waste Incinerators, Biomedical Waste Incinerators, Sewage Sludge Incinerators, Hazardous Waste Incinerators, Steel Manufacturing Electric Arc Furnaces, Iron Sintering Plants (August 2004), as amended. Non-incineration (5.2) Biomedical wastes not listed in section 5.1 may be treated with non-incineration methods provided the technology will reduce bacterial spores of B. stearothermophilus within the waste by a level of 6 Log10 (99.9999%). Testing of Non-Incineration Treatment Equipment (5.2.1) Non-incineration technologies used to treat biomedical waste should be tested at least once in every six operating days to confirm that the equipment is capable of meeting the requirements set out in section 5.2. A record of each test shall be retained at the treatment facility for a minimum of two years and must be in a format that is available for inspection by Ministry of the Environment staff. On Site Biomedical Waste Treatment Facilities (6) Treatment On-Site (6.1) Processing: The on site processing of biomedical waste should be undertaken in accordance with section 5.2. It should be noted that section 17.1 of Regulation 347 (General - Waste Management) may apply to exempt waste processing activities occurring at a waste generation facility from the requirement to hold a certificate of approval under Part V of the EPA. The regulation and Part V of the EPA should be referred to for more information. In all circumstances Regulation 347, Part V of the EPA and any other applicable laws must be complied with. Treated biomedical waste generated by a facility should be stored separately from untreated biomedical waste and all other wastes. When compacting treated biomedical waste mechanical compaction that is part of a single, self-contained process, should be used. Disposal: At a minimum, the on-site disposal of biomedical waste should follow the standards specified in sections 5.1. Regulation 347 (General - Waste Management) and Part V of the EPA may apply additional requirements to a waste generation facility that uses incineration. In all circumstances Part V of the Act, Regulation 347 and any other applicable laws must be complied with. Transportation of Biomedical Waste Off-Site (7) General Requirements (7.1) Prior to the removal of biomedical waste from a site for off-site disposal, the generator should package the waste in accordance with Section 4.0 of this guideline. The waste may only be transported by a waste management company for which a waste management system certificate of approval has been issued under Part V of the EPA. Vehicle Standards (7.2) The following standards apply to vehicles used to transport biomedical waste and are in addition to any standards prescribed by Regulation 347(General - Waste Management). It is recommended that these standards be incorporated into a biomedical waste carrier's waste management system certificate of approval. - Vehicles must be appropriately designed and outfitted to accommodate the biomedical waste to be transported in the vehicle, including a storage compartment that: - is enclosed and insulated, - is kept refrigerated at or below 4 degrees Celsius at all times, when the vehicle contains any waste, - has an independent refrigeration system which shall be operable at all times when the vehicle is parked or inoperable, - has walls that are made of a washable material and a floor surfaced with metal for effective cleaning and disinfecting, - has a floor that is sealed and leak proof, - has a suitable system capable of containing liquids, - has no windows or ventilation, - only one lockable door and at least one interior light, and - is not capable of mechanical compaction. - The vehicle must be equipped with spill clean-up equipment and disinfectant appropriate for the waste being transported. - The vehicle shall not be used for a purpose other than transporting biomedical waste unless it has been completely disinfected. - The vehicle's storage compartment door must be kept locked at all times when the vehicle is not being actively loaded or unloaded. - At the end of each day of operation, the interior of the storage compartment of the vehicle shall be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected with a disinfecting solution. Final Disposal of Treated Biomedical Waste (8) Treatment Off-Site (8.1) A waste disposal site receiving biomedical waste from another site is required to comply with Regulation 347 (General - Waste Management), Part V of the EPA, including the requirement that the facility hold a valid certificate of approval authorizing the handling of the waste, and all other applicable laws. Transportation for Final Disposal (8.2) Prior to treated biomedical waste leaving a facility for final disposal at a waste disposal site, the facility operator should do the following: - Provide written notification to the operator of the waste disposal site where the waste is destined detailing both the quantity of the waste and its approximate time of arrival. - Provide written notification to the carrier of the waste confirming that all the waste in the shipment has been treated. A carrier of treated or untreated biomedical waste should transport the waste as directly as practicable to its final waste disposal site without the use of transfer stations or other intermediary sites. No other waste should be transported in a vehicle containing treated or untreated biomedical waste. Land Disposal of Treated Biomedical Waste (8.3) Treated biomedical waste should be deposited for final disposal at an Ontario waste disposal site with an appropriate certificate of approval issued under Part V of the EPA. The disposal of the waste should be supervised by the operator of the site or a person designated by the operator for this purpose. After the waste is deposited in the site, a sufficient quantity of other waste or cover material should be placed over it to prevent direct contact between site equipment and the waste.
