How Does Ayurvedic Medicine Work? Ayurvedic medicine is based on the idea that everyone is made up of five basic elements: - Air - Earth - Fire - Ether (space) - Water These elements combine in the body to form life forces called doshas. Everyone is thought to contain a mix of doshas, but has one that's stronger than the others. The three doshas are: - Vata, which is ether and air - Pitta, which is fire and water - Kapha, which is water and earth Ayurvedic specialists believe [psoriasis](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/psoriasis/understanding-psoriasis-basics) results from unbalanced vata and kapha doshas. They think that toxins, [stress](https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/default.htm), and too much of certain foods, like yogurt, seafood, and salty food, also can be to blame.

There's not much thorough research on ayurvedic medicine for psoriasis or most other health conditions. One 2011 study of 111 people with psoriasis found that using ayurvedic medications improved their quality of life. In India, ayurvedic doctors must meet certain training standards. But licensing isn't available in the United States, where ayurveda is considered an alternative therapy. The FDA regulates ayurvedic medicines as supplements, not [drugs](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx). So they don't have to meet the same requirements. If you choose to use ayurvedic medicine to treat your psoriasis, here are some steps you can take to stay safe: - Continue to see your doctor. Don't use ayurvedic medicine instead of a doctor for your psoriasis. - Let your doctor know what ayurvedic treatments you use. Be open about all the steps you're taking to manage your psoriasis. That way, your doctor can let you know if any of them might be harmful or might interfere with your other treatments. - Be careful about what you use and buy. The FDA doesn't review ayurvedic products. And one study found 1 in 5 ayurvedic medicines contain toxic metals like lead and arsenic. When in doubt, ask your doctor before trying a new product. "}
