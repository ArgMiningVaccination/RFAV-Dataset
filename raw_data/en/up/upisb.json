Any symptoms of chronic pain or illness will be discussed, as well as your interests and current lifestyle. From there, your therapist will recommend a movement therapy that's right for you, which could include a single method practice or a combination of techniques such as yoga, massage, tai chi, or dance therapy. During your session, your therapist will evaluate your movements and assess your emotional and bodily reactions, and use this information to respond to you by recommending other movements or incorporating additional forms of movement therapy. Movement therapy sessions can be one-on-one or in a group and vary in length. You may feel benefits from your treatment in as little as one session, though regular treatments are recommended to maintain your level of wellness.
