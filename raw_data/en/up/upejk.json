Get your facts right before you rely on this line of treatment for healthy tresses. You must be tired of trying a variety of hair loss products and treatments but seeing no results. You should opt for homeopathic treatment for hair loss instead! Hair loss is one of the most common hair problems that many individuals face worldwide. Many of us avoid brushing our hair since it can result in more hair shedding and damage. Then, dandruff flares up as winter approaches, irritating your scalp and causing further hair loss. Therefore, many people tend to try out new remedies that promise to help them stop losing their hair. If you are one of these folks who hasn't had any luck, you may want to check out homeopathy. Homeopathy is a type of alternative medicine that practices a holistic approach by focusing on stimulating the body's natural healing mechanisms. Hair loss can be treated using various homeopathic remedies or herbs. But first, let's discuss why people lose their hair. Keep scrolling! In This Article Causes Of Hair Loss It can be difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of your hair fall, but here are some factors that lead to it: - Stress: Stress, both physical and emotional, has been linked to hair loss. Physical stress in the form of an injury or an accident triggers a type of hair loss called telogen effluviumi [X]A form of temporary hair loss that occurs after a traumatic or stressful event where the hair follicles go into a resting phase. ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28925637)). - Excessive Intake Of Vitamin A: A study conducted by the American Academy of Dermatology found that consuming too much vitamin A can lead to increased hair loss ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6380979/)). - Pregnancy: Pregnancy is responsible for hair loss caused by physical stress. Post-delivery hair loss is very common in women ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1799260/?page=1)). - Heredity: It is common for women to experience hair loss if they have a history of female balding in their family ( [4](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001173.htm)). - Protein Deficiency: Hair is made up of protein. Not consuming enough protein can curb hair growth and lead to hair loss ( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315033/)). - Hormonal Imbalances: Changes in the hormones, starting or going off birth-control pills, and conditions like PCOSi [X]A condition caused by the production of an abnormal amount of androgens characterized by cysts in ovaries and irregular menstrual cycles. have all been linked to hair fall ( [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4828511/)). - Vitamin D Deficiency: Consumption of vitamins is crucial when it comes to maintaining the health of your hair. A study has shown that females with either telogen effluvium (TE) or female pattern hair loss (FPHL) usually have lower levels of vitamin D ( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315033/)). You may consume vitamin D supplements to treat the deficiency and improve hair growth. - Thyroid Disorders: When your thyroid is over or under functional, it directly affects the health of your hair, resulting in hair loss ( [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3746235/)). - Alopecia Areata: This is an autoimmune disorder in which your immune system mistakes your hair for a foreign object and attacks it, leading to hair loss ( [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538178/)). A [report](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537000/) showed that the general population has a lifetime risk of approximately 2% for developing alopecia areata. The prevalence of AA varies between 0.1% to 0.2% based on geographic location and ethnicity. The occurrence of AA in adults with a family history ranges from 0% to 8.6%. Early onset AA, typically seen in children aged 5 to 10, tends to be more severe. - Drastic Weight Loss: Drastic weight loss is often accompanied by a sudden loss of nutrients ( [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315033/)). Your hair needs proper nutrition for growth. When it is not well-nourished, it can lead to hair loss. - Aging: Hair loss is a common symptom of aging. Studies show that aging of hair follicles affects hair growth ( [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20172841)). All of these factors may seem a bit worrying, but there's one thing that may help you tackle them all: homeopathy. There are many homeopathic medicines and treatments out there that can help you in hair loss prevention and regrowth. Check them out in the next section. Homeopathy Medicines For Hair Loss Homeopathy has various treatments for hair loss, depending on the cause of the problem.
