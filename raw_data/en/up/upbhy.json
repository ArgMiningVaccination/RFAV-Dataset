In the past, when I've provided specific keto meal plans, it has led to a flood of messages and emails asking about substitutions, adding more calories for men or very active women, adjusting for your personal macros, how to plan for multiple people doing the plans, and how to customize them if you hate avocados, eggs, puppies, are vegetarian, or are allergic to light and air. Since I can't possibly anticipate all of your personal wants/needs with a perfect keto meal plan tailored to you as an individual, I'm going with a more flexible approach to the Squeaky Clean Keto Challenge meal plans so that you can do you. This Week 1 Squeaky Clean Keto Meal Plan provides a selection of squeaky clean keto friendly recipes (you don't have to use them) that you can prep in advance and then eat when you want to. There are a variety of snack and drink options to choose from (or not,) and you can add those in as your personal calorie needs allow - providing you stay under the 20g net carbs per day that is recommended for everyone to remain in ketosis. Each recipe or item is followed by the approximate nutrition info, so that you can mix and match while still staying within your carb and calorie budget for each day. You can print out and handwrite your personal squeaky clean keto menu plan, or download it into a format (see the list of options at the bottom) that you can type into and track electronically. Whatever is easier for you personally. Hopefully this approach to keto meal planning will not only allow you to get a custom Week 1 Squeaky Clean Keto Meal Plan that works best for you, it will also help you learn how to plan your meals moving forward after the Squeaky Clean Keto Challenge is complete, and you'll be prepared to transition back to regular keto armed with the tools to succeed.
