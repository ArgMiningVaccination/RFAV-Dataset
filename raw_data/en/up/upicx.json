This study examined the effects of an inpatient portal intervention on patient activation, patient satisfaction, patient engagement with health information, and 30-day hospital admissions. A randomized trial was conducted from March 2014 to May 2017 with 426 English- or Spanish-speaking patients from 2 cardiac medical-surgical units at an urban academic medical center. Patients were randomized into 3 groups: 1) usual care, 2) tablet with general Internet access, and 3) tablet with an inpatient portal. There was a difference in patient activation between the 3 groups, but the inpatient portal group had lower 30-day hospital admissions. There was also a difference with patient engagement with health information between the inpatient portal and tablet-only groups. AHRQ-funded; HS021816.

Investigators estimated cholesterol scores for patients between the ages of 40 and 79 in large practice electronic health networks who did not have that in their electronic health record (EHR). This data was used to calculate 10-year Assessment of Cardiovascular Disease Risk (ASCVD) risk scores for patients in 219 practices. They estimated the scores using both \"good value' estimation methodology and formal imputation. The \"good value\" estimation methodology resulted in less patients with risk scores than imputation but it had higher specificity and a lower false positive rate. AHRQ-funded; HS023912.

Clinical decision support (CDS) hard-stop alerts-those in which the user is either prevented from taking an action altogether or allowed to proceed only with the external override of a third party-are increasingly common but can be problematic. To understand their appropriate application, the investigators explored 3 key questions: (1) To what extent are hard-stop alerts effective in improving patient health and healthcare delivery outcomes? (2) What are the adverse events and unintended consequences of hard-stop alerts? (3) How do hard-stop alerts Efficacy and unintended consequences of hard-stop alerts in electronic health record systems: a systematic review.

The authors adapted methods that allow for automated 'noisy labeling' of positive and negative controls to create a \"silver standard\" for machine learning to automate identification of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Their final model outperformed all existing algorithms for SLE. They demonstrated how the probabilistic outputs of their model can be adapted to various clinical needs. Deploying a similar methodology to other complex diseases has the potential to dramatically simplify the landscape of population identification in the electronic health record. AHRQ-funded; HS024412.

In this study, the investigators evaluated the impact of a national, multicomponent, quality improvement (QI) programme designed to reduce low-value EHR notifications. The investigators found that, based on prior estimates on time to process notifications, this national QI programme potentially saved 1.5 hours per week per PCP to enable higher value work. The investigators also found that the number of daily notifications remained high, suggesting the need for additional multifaceted interventions and protected clinical time to help manage them.

Researchers described physician perceptions of the potential goals, characteristics, and content of the electronic problem list (PL) in pediatric trauma. They identified five goals of the PL, seven characteristics, and 22 patient-related information elements. They found that physicians involved in pediatric trauma care described the electronic PL as ideally more than a list of a patient's medical diagnoses and injuries. They recommend future work to evaluate the optimal design of the PL so that users with emergent cases have access to key information related to the patient's immediate problems. AR .

The article reports on a study designed to investigate documentation strategies used by home care nurses with respect to entering electronic data during admission as well as the effect of nursing goals on the process. This was done to characterize admission nurses' practices at the point of care and to establish a basis for design recommendations for electronic health records (EHRs). Five nurses in rural Pennsylvania home care agencies were observed during the admission process. The results of the study lead the authors to recommend that EHR design and training should support the manner in which home care nurses document patient encounters. AHRQ-funded; HS024537.

The EHR problem list has the potential to support care coordination among the multidisciplinary care team that cares for pediatric trauma patients. To realize this potential, the need exists to ensure appropriate utilization by formulating acceptable usage and management policy. In this regard, understanding the prevailing utilization pattern is pivotal. To this end, in this study, the investigators analyzed EHR in tandem with trauma registry data at a Level I pediatric trauma center. AHRQ-funded; HS023837.

Automating the extraction of behavioral criteria indicative of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in electronic health records (EHRs) can contribute significantly to the effort to monitor the condition. Word embedding algorithms such as Word2Vec can encode semantic meanings of words in vectors and assist in automated vocabulary discovery from EHRs. However, text available for training word embeddings for ASD is miniscule compared to the billions of tokens typically used. In this study, the investigators evaluated the importance of corpus specificity versus size and hypothesized that for specific domains small corpora can generate excellent word embeddings.

Research examining whether and how adolescent patients should gain access to their electronic health records is gaining momentum. In this study, the investigators conducted a survey to explore diversity in adolescent privacy policies and identify common approaches in health information technology management for adolescent patients. Through descriptive analyses of survey data, they found a wide range of institutional policies regarding adolescent patient privacy, and large variations in health IT executives' baseline knowledge of access policies.

The goal of this study was to determine how the negative healthcare experiences of low patient centeredness and care coordination problems motivate the use of different eHealth activities, and whether more highly educated individuals are more likely than those less highly educated to use eHealth following negative experiences. Researchers used factor analysis to group 25 different eHealth activities into categories, based on the correlation between respondents' reports of their usage. Their findings indicate that individuals use a greater number of eHealth activities, especially activities independent of healthcare providers, when they experience problems with their healthcare; people with lower levels of education who have had negative healthcare experiences seem more inclined to use eHealth. The researchers recommend that, in order to maximize the potential for eHealth to meet the needs of all patients, especially those who are underserved, additional work is needed to ensure that eHealth resources are accessible to all members of the population.

The objective of this study was to examine how older adult patients perceive the benefits and risks of proxy patient portal access by their caregivers. The investigators concluded that patients shared their electronic patient portal credentials with caregivers to receive the benefits of those caregivers having access to important medical information but were unaware of all the information those caregivers could access. They suggest that better portal design could alleviate these unwanted information disclosures. AHRQ-funded; HS021679. Citation: Latulipe C, Quandt SA, Melius KA .
