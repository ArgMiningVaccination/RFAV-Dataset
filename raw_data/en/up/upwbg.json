We, Dr. Marc and I, have our preference. We did our research/homework and made our decision. Now we do not advocate one way or the other, we do advocate you educate yourself as we did. We always advise our patients, friends and family to research anything you take in the name of health, as the people advising you to take it usually have an ulterior motive. That doesn't mean what they say is wrong or untrue, and I'm not being skeptical, just find being informed is really helpful to your health. After all its your body, your children, the people telling you to take something will not be suffering any if you or your children have a severe reaction or death. It will be you asking why did this happen? They also can not tell you ahead of time if your child will be susceptible to a bad reaction or not. They said only 1 out of a hundred will be affected, think about it, not good odds. If you look at the increased rate of auto immune disease, ADHD, ADD, autism, since the government has allowed the \"cocktailing\" of vaccines there seems a very scary correlation. It just makes common sense that a new born can not handle the immediate shock of several vaccinations within the first 24 hours of life, maybe not the first few years. Not all of our babies are term, even being born 2 weeks early means less time for our cells to mature. Our bodies mature faster from birth to 5 years of age than any time in our life, do they really need to have their immune system in overdrive the first few hours of their life? Unless you are in an area where the disease is prevelant, I see no rush. The government is worried about mass casualties from an epidemic for a few rare dieases, some have even been eraticated.They say it is to protect us, well some of us. It apparently seems ok to lose a few for the good of the masses. Check the odds of child death or severe reaction before you commit your child to the greater good. Don't let the nurse or Doctor scare you with the look of pity or discust, it's your child. Or maybe you'll will be lucky and just have to deal with diseases like autisim and auto immune disorders. People call that absurd, they say autism is from bad diet, environmental issues, But I would challenge them by asking why do these particular diseases span the scope of our socioeconomic culture? Rich, poor, good diet, bad all have these illnesses. What do they all share? Immunizations at birth. Why do I call it a sensitive issue? Because the AMA, drug companies and much of the medical community will say if you choose not to you are endangering the whole world, you are a bad parent and why would any parent want their child to suffer polio, etc... You will be labeled selfish and crazy. You will be told it's against the law not to, your children can not go to school with out them, all of which are lies. If you wish to vaccinate it's your right, but it should be to vaccinate for the illnesses you want and at the age you want. Also if you decide to vaccinate, ask what the vaccine is made up of, ask for mercury free, yes some are still out there. Don't be a sheep. The article I am sharing below states exactly what I have always considered the cause of many of our health issues today. Just please be informed. (NaturalNews) A new study, published in Human and Experimental Toxicology, a peer-reviewed journal indexed by the National Library of Medicine, analyzed more than 38,000 reports of infant hospitalizations and deaths following vaccinations.[1] Researchers found statistically significant correlations between the number of vaccine doses administered to infants and infant hospitalization and mortality rates: babies who receive the most vaccines tend to have higher (worse) hospitalization and death rates. Infants who received 2 vaccines simultaneously were significantly less likely to be hospitalized than infants who received 3 or more vaccines at the same time. Infants who received 3 vaccines simultaneously were significantly less likely to be hospitalized than infants who received 4 or more vaccines at the same time. Babies who received 6, 7, or 8 vaccines during a single pediatric well-baby visit were the most likely to be hospitalized following their injections. In fact, the hospitalization rate increased linearly from 11.0% for infants receiving 2 vaccine doses to 23.5% for infants receiving 8 vaccine doses. The authors of the study, Dr. Gary Goldman and Neil Z. Miller, also discovered that younger infants were significantly more likely to be hospitalized after receiving vaccinations than older infants. In addition, infants who received 5-8 vaccines simultaneously were significantly more likely to die following their shots than infants who received 1-4 vaccines simultaneously. Several factors could contribute to whether an infant will have an adverse reaction to vaccines, including a genetic predisposition, illness (which may be a contraindication to vaccine administration), quality of vaccines (which can vary by manufacturing methods), and sensitivity to one or more vaccine components. Some infants might be more likely to experience an adverse reaction due to biochemical or synergistic toxicity associated with concurrent administration of multiple vaccines. In 1990, infants received a total of 15 vaccine doses prior to their first year of life. By 2007, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended 26 vaccine doses for infants: 3 DTaP, 3 polio, 3 Hib, 3 hepatitis B, 3 pneumococcal, 3 rotavirus, and 2 influenza vaccines. The CDC's Childhood Immunization Schedule Was Not Tested for Safety, Lacks Scientific Veracity: While each childhood vaccine has individually undergone clinical trials to assess safety, studies have not been conducted to determine the safety (or efficacy) of combining vaccines during a single physician visit as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) guidelines. For example, 2-, 4-, and 6-month-old infants are expected to receive vaccines for polio, hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, rotavirus, Haemophilus influenzae type B, and pneumococcal, all during a single well-baby visit -- even though this combination of 8 vaccines was never tested in clinical trials. Although the CDC's recommended childhood immunization schedule a) requires infants to receive up to 8 vaccines simultaneously, b) affects millions of infants annually, and c) was never scientifically tested for safety, the CDC had prior knowledge that combining chemical substances, including prescribed pharmaceuticals, \"can produce health consequences that are additive, synergistic, antagonistic, or can potentiate the response expected from individual component exposures.\"[2] Administering 6, 7, or 8 vaccine doses to an infant during a single physician visit may certainly be more convenient for parents -- rather than making additional trips to the doctor's office -- but evidence of a positive association between infant adverse reactions and the number of vaccine doses administered confirms that vaccine safety must remain the highest priority. The findings in this study show a positive correlation between the number of vaccine doses administered and the percentage of hospitalizations and deaths reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). (The VAERS database is an important postmarketing safety surveillance tool that is periodically analyzed by the CDC, FDA, and other vaccine researchers to discover potentially adverse vaccination trends.) In addition, younger infants were significantly more likely than older infants to be hospitalized or die after receiving vaccines. These trends not only have a biological plausibility but are supported by evidence from case reports, case series, and other studies using entirely different methodologies and unique population cohorts. For example, in 2011, Miller and Goldman collaborated on another study showing that among developed nations infant mortality increased with an increase in the number of vaccine doses.[3] Since vaccines are given to millions of infants annually, it is imperative that health authorities have scientific data from synergistic toxicity studies on all combinations of vaccines that infants might receive. Finding ways to increase vaccine safety should be the highest priority.
