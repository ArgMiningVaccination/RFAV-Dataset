There are many reasons why people with cancer consider using complementary therapies, which are generally used in combination with conventional cancer treatment. They may offer you physical, emotional and spiritual support, reduce side effects from medical treatment, and improve your quality of life. This booklet provides an overview of the role of a number of complementary therapies in cancer care. It does not include in-depth information about alternative therapies, which some people choose instead of conventional treatment. If you want to consider using complementary therapies, discuss this with your doctors, pharmacists and other health professionals qualified in the therapies you are interested in. Some terms that may be unfamiliar are explained in the glossary. Y ou may also like to pass this booklet to your family and friends for their information.Introduction If you or your family have any questions, call Cancer Council 13 11 20 .

Cancer is a disease of the cells, which are the body's basic building blocks. The body constantly makes new cells to help us grow, replace worn-out tissue and heal injuries. Normally, cells multiply and die in an orderly way. Sometimes cells don't grow, divide and die in the usual way. This may cause blood or lymph fluid in the body to become abnormal, or form a lump called a tumour. A tumour can be benign or malignant. Benign tumour - Cells are confined to one area and are not able to spread to other parts of the body. This is not cancer. Malignant tumour - This is made up of cancerous cells, which have the ability to spread by travelling through the bloodstream or lymphatic system (lymph fluid). Malignant or invasive cancer Abnormal cellsAngiogenesis Abnormal cells multiplyAbnormal cellsHow cancer starts Normal cellsNormal cells Lymph vesselBoundary Blood vessel 4 Cancer CouncilThe cancer that first develops in a tissue or organ is called the primary cancer. A malignant tumour is usually named after the organ or type of cell affected. A malignant tumour that has not spread to other parts of the body is called localised cancer. A tumour may invade deeper into surrounding tissue and can grow its own blood vessels (angiogenesis). If cancerous cells grow and form another tumour at a new site, it is called a secondary cancer or metastasis. A metastasis keeps the name of the original cancer. For example, liver cancer that has spread to the bones is called metastatic liver cancer, even though the person may be experiencing symptoms caused by problems in the bones. How cancer spreads Angiogenesis - tumours grow their own blood vessels Metastasis - cells invade other parts of the body via blood vessels and lymph vesselsPrimary cancer Local invasion Lymph vessel What is cancer? 5Cancer treatments The most effective form of treatment for cancer is conventional medicine. Some people use complementary therapies as well to relieve side effects of their cancer treatments. Alternative therapies have not been shown to be effective in treating cancer. Conventional medicine - This can be used to control or cure cancer by slowing or stopping the growth and spread of the disease. It can also provide relief from symptoms. Conventional treatments are based on scientific evidence and successful clinical trials, and include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone treatment. The treatment you have depends on the type, stage and location of the cancer, your age and general health. Complementary therapies and medicines - These tend to focus on the whole person, not just the cancer. They may help people cope better with symptoms of cancer and/or side effects caused by conventional treatments. Research into complementary therapies and medicines is increasing. Alternative therapies and medicines - These are used in place of conventional medical treatments. This can delay or stop the cancer being treated effectively. Many alternative therapies have not been scientifically tested, so there is no proof they stop cancer growing or spreading. Others have been shown to not be effective. Side effects of alternative treatments are not always known. Integrative medicine is the combined use of conventional cancer treatments and evidence-based complementary therapies. 6 Cancer CouncilWhat is the evidence? Conventional cancer treatments have been through a rigorous testing process to see how safe and effective they are. New treatments are first tested in laboratories and then on large groups of people in what is called a clinical trial. The strongest evidence comes from clinical trials that involve two groups of people. One group is given the new treatment and the other group is given the existing standard treatment. The two groups are compared. The results are looked at by independent experts (peer-reviewed) and published in medical journals. If the new treatment works better than existing treatments, it may become the new standard treatment. This process provides the scientific evidence for the treatment. With the increasing use of complementary therapies, many are now being scientifically tested to see what effects they have on people with cancer, how they interact with conventional treatments and why they might be effective. Many of these tests have explored whether complementary therapies and medicines are effective in reducing specific symptoms to help people feel better during and after conventional cancer treatment. Some therapies are supported by strong evidence, while others lack rigorous scientific evidence. To find out more about clinical trials, call Cancer Council 13 11 20 for a free copy of Understanding Clinical Trials and Research . Cancer treatments 7Many alternative therapies and medicines have not been scientifically tested, or they have been tested and shown not to work or to be harmful to people with cancer. Some alternative practitioners promote their therapies and medicines as a cure for cancer, and encourage people to stop using conventional cancer treatment. If this is something you are considering, discuss this with your doctor first. Alternative therapies can be expensive, and they are not covered by Medicare or the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS - a government-funded scheme that subsidises some prescription medicines). It is important to consider the cost of these therapies if you are thinking about using them. Cancer Council does not recommend the use of alternative therapies as a treatment for cancer. Only complementary therapies that have been proven to be safe to use alongside conventional cancer treatments are discussed in this booklet. 'Complementary' vs 'alternative' The terms 'complementary' and 'alternative' are often used interchangeably, which can be confusing. Complementary therapies are designed to be used alongside conventional cancer treatments, usually to manage side effects. Alternative therapies are used instead of conventional treatment. Many complementary therapies are being scientifically researched for use in people with cancer, while alternative therapies are unlikely to be tested in this way. 8 Cancer CouncilSafety of alternative therapies Keep the following warning signs in mind if you are thinking about using an alternative cancer treatment instead of conventional medicine: The practitioner does not have a qualification from an accredited educational institution in the therapy they provide. The practitioner is not registered with a governing body or a professional association. The practitioner tells you that conventional medical treatment will stop the therapy or remedy they provide from working. The practitioner asks you not to talk to your doctors about their treatment, or won't tell you the ingredients that make up a herbal preparation they give you. The practitioner claims that their treatment cures cancer. The practitioner says there are clinical studies for the effectiveness of their remedy or therapy, but does not show you proof that has appeared in trusted medical journals. The treatment costs a lot of money or you need to pay in advance for several months' supply of a remedy. You need to travel overseas to have the treatment. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) tracks health and medical scams in an effort to keep the public informed about which scams are in circulation.

A: Complementary therapies are widely used by people with cancer in Australia. A study conducted in 2010 showed that two out of three people with cancer used at least one form of complementary therapy during or after their cancer treatment.1 Women are the most common users of complementary therapies, particularly those with breast cancer. The longer someone has had cancer, the more likely they are to try them. Q: Why do people use these therapies? A: There are many reasons why people diagnosed with cancer use complementary therapies. For some, it is important to try as many options as possible. Other reasons include: wanting a healthier lifestyle feeling more in control helping improve the side effects of conventional cancer treatment boosting the immune system to help fight infection strengthening the body to cope with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy trying to reduce the need for invasive, painful or expensive conventional treatments liking the idea of treating the whole person helping with changes in sexuality (libido, self-esteem and intimate relationships) enhancing quality of life helping with palliative care. 10 Cancer CouncilQ: Which therapies work? A: Cancer Council supports the use of complementary therapies that have been proven to be safe and effective in scientific studies. Not all therapies in this book have been scientifically proven to be clinically effective. Where the evidence is not available, the possible benefits and any harm they might cause should be considered by you and your health care team. Personal (anecdotal) evidence from people with cancer and, in some cases, a long history of use in traditional medicine suggest that particular therapies are worth exploring and may be useful for some people. Evidence supporting the different therapies is included in the chapters Mind-body techniques (page 24), Body-based practices (page 35), Therapies using herbs (page 47), Therapies based on diet (page 53) and Other therapies (page 56). In clinical trials, some therapies have been shown to be helpful for the various effects of cancer and its treatment. These are listed on the next page.Complementary therapy use in palliative care Complementary therapies are often used by palliative care patients to help improve their general wellbeing. Most health professionals who are involved in palliative care will be sympathetic if you choose to explore and use complementary therapies. The care team may warn against some therapies they believe are harmful, but you always have the right to choose your own treatment while also receiving the best care from health professionals.

A: Y es. Discuss any therapy you may be using or are thinking about using with your doctors. It's important to tell your doctors before you start using any complementary therapy, especially if you are having chemotherapy or radiotherapy or taking medication. See page 63 for more information. It's also important to tell your complementary therapist that you have cancer, and advise them of the treatment you're having. Q: Are they safe? A: Many complementary therapies are usually safe to use together with conventional cancer treatment. However, some complementary therapies can affect the way conventional treatments work, and even stop them from working altogether. See the individual therapies information (pages 24-58) for more details on potential side effects and other considerations. Be sure to seek a qualified complementary therapist who can provide you with an expert opinion and ongoing support, and is happy to work with you and your health care team. Regulation of medicinal products The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is a federal government department that regulates all medicines sold in Australia, including complementary medicines. This includes herbs, vitamins, minerals, nutritional supplements, homoeopathic remedies and some aromatherapy products. Key questions 13The regulation of complementary medicines helps to protect the public by ensuring that therapeutic goods are manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practice and that any adverse reactions can be investigated. Before they are supplied in Australia, all therapeutic goods - whether manufactured in Australia or overseas - must be included on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). Australia has a two-tiered system for regulating all medicinal products, including prescription, over-the-counter and complementary medicines. Medicines will be given one of the following two codes: Aust L (listed) - These products can make only low- level therapeutic claims and can include only ingredients approved by the TGA as safe. They are not evaluated by the TGA prior to entry on the ARTG, but they may be reviewed by the TGA once they are on the ARTG. Aust R (registered) - Because these products are considered higher risk, they are fully evaluated by the TGA for safety, quality and efficacy before being included on the ARTG. All prescription medicines, most over-the-counter medicines and some higher-risk complementary medicines are registered. There is no assurance for consumers that complementary medicines that are not included on the ARTG have been manufactured to Australian standards of quality and safety. 14 Cancer Council Regulation of complementary therapists In Australia, some complementary therapists are regulated by national legislation. Chinese medicine practitioners, acupuncturists, Chinese herbal medicine dispensers - These practitioners are members of the Chinese Medicine Board of Australia, which is part of the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). AHPRA also regulates other health practitioners, such as doctors, nurses and pharmacists. AHPRA ensures that practitioners are adequately qualified to practise. Naturopaths and Western herbalists - These practitioners are not registered by AHPRA. However, most naturopaths and herbalists are members of the Australian Register of Naturopaths and Herbalists. This is a self-governing body that maintains a certain standard of practice for both professions. Homoeopaths - These practitioners are not registered by AHPRA. However, the Australian Register Of Homoeopaths (AROH) is a non-government organisation that represents homoeopaths who are qualified to practise in line with standards set by the government. The AROH outlines certain professional standards for registered homoeopaths, who must meet continuing education requirements each year.For more information on the safety, labelling and regulation of medicines, visit tga.gov.au . Key questions 15Q: What should I do if something goes wrong? A: If you experience any side effects that you think are from a complementary treatment, stop the treatment and talk to your practitioner. They will work out how to change your treatment to reduce the chance of the problem recurring. If this does not resolve the issue, you may decide to stop the treatment permanently, consider seeking a second opinion, or transfer your care to another qualified practitioner. If you are concerned that the practitioner has been negligent, incompetent or unethical, consider the following options: If the practitioner belongs to a professional association, contact the association with a formal complaint (see pages 70-71 for contact details). They may be able to investigate and decide what action to take. Report adverse reactions directly to NPS MedicineWise's Adverse Medicine Events Line on 1300 134 237. Y ou can also tell your doctor, who will report it to the TGA. Contact the health care complaints commission in your state or territory. This organisation protects public health and safety by investigating and resolving complaints about health care providers. It can also prosecute serious complaints. If you have a serious reaction that needs immediate medical attention, call 000 or go straight to your nearest emergency department. 16 Cancer CouncilMaking complaints about health care providers State/ territoryContact details ACTACT Human Rights Commission 02 6205 2222 NSWHealth Care Complaints Commission 1800 043 159 hccc.nsw.gov.au NTHealth and Community Services Complaints Commission 1800 004 474 www. hcscc.nt.gov.au QLDOffice of the Health Ombudsman 133 646 oho.qld.gov.au SAHealth and Community Services Complaints Commissioner 08 8226 8666; 1800 232 007 (toll free from country SA) hcscc.sa.gov.au TASHealth Complaints Commissioner Tasmania 1800 001 170 www. healthcomplaints.tas.gov.au VICOffice of the Health Services Commissioner 1300 582 113 health.vic.gov.au/hsc WAHealth and Disability Services Complaints Office 08 6551 7600; 1800 813 583 (toll free from country WA) hadsco.wa.gov.au Key questions 17Key points Complementary therapies are widely used in Australia. It's estimated that two out of three people with cancer use some type of complementary therapy during or after their cancer treatment. People may have more than one reason for using a complementary therapy. Some reasons include feeling more in control, liking the idea of treating the whole person, and enhancing quality of life. There is less scientific evidence available about the safety and effectiveness of complementary therapies than there is for conventional treatments. Always seek a qualified practitioner with relevant qualifications who can provide you with an expert opinion and is happy to work with you and your doctor. The federal government's Therapeutic Goods Administration is responsible for regulating therapeutic goods sold in Australia. These include complementary medicines such as minerals, vitamins, herbal medicines, nutritional supplements, homoeopathic medicines and some aromatherapy products. Tell your doctor and your complementary therapist about all drugs, herbs, nutritional supplements and other remedies you take. Herbs and conventional treatments can sometimes interact, stopping medication from working properly or causing side effects. It is important that you talk to your doctor if you are thinking about using alternative therapies instead of conventional cancer treatments. 18 Cancer CouncilHolistic approaches to health care Most types of complementary therapies are part of wider holistic health care systems. Holistic health care aims to treat a person as a whole, not just the disease and its symptoms. In Australia, the main traditional holistic health care systems practised are naturopathy, traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine and homoeopathy. Their origins differ, but they share the following beliefs: The body needs to be balanced physically, emotionally and spiritually to be healthy. Ill health often has more than one cause. The body has a vital energy reflecting its level of health and wellbeing. The body can heal itself. Health care must be tailored to the individual. Naturopathy What it is: Naturopathy maintains that the mind, body and spirit are all connected, and that the body can heal itself through dietary and lifestyle changes. Many of the underlying principles of naturopathy, such as the importance of diet and exercise, are also part of conventional medicine. Naturopathy finds and treats both the cause and effect of a person's symptoms using a combination of dietary changes, bodywork such as various forms of massage, and herbal medicines or nutritional supplements. Holistic approaches to health care 19Alan's story In 2010, I was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. It was quite a shock for me and my then fianc\u00e9e (now my wife). We'd never heard of it. I was in a lot of pain and wasn't able to move, but my doctor put me on a combination of drugs. Within a few weeks I was feeling less pain. Since then I've had a lot of treatment. I had a bone marrow transplant, with my brother as the donor, a week after my wedding. At one point I was taking 28 tablets a day. One morning I woke up with a metallic taste in my mouth and found I couldn't taste any food. I saw doctors, dietitians and nutritionists, but no-one could explain why I had lost my sense of taste or if it would come back. Wondering what I was going to eat became all I could think about.I decided I'd do everything in my power to help myself. I did some research online and found that having low levels of zinc and B vitamins can cause a loss of taste and smell. A friend recommended I see a naturopath. At my first appointment the naturopath asked me about the myeloma and my treatments. He also tested my zinc levels by giving me a spoonful of zinc solution and asking me what I could taste, which was nothing. He suggested I take zinc and vitamin B supplements. Because I'm on a clinical trial, I checked with the nurses beforehand. They were very encouraging and said it would be okay. After two months I started to regain my sense of taste and smell. My wife's a great cook and I can't wait to have some of her food. You can't expect a quick fix - I know using the supplements will take time. 20 Cancer CouncilWhat to expect: After taking a case history, a naturopath may suggest a combination of diet changes, bodywork or exercise, and herbal or nutritional remedies. Evidence: The benefits of some aspects of naturopathy, such as massage and nutrition (excluding extreme dietary practices), have good clinical evidence for people with cancer. Other aspects of naturopathy have mixed levels of evidence. See individual therapies for more information. Traditional Chinese medicine What it is: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is based on using the connection between mind, body and environment to prevent and manage diseases, such as cancer. TCM practitioners consider the person's overall condition, not just the symptoms. It may help people with cancer strengthen their vital force (qi) and cope with the side effects of conventional treatment. TCM includes acupuncture, tai chi, qi gong and the use of foods and herbs to improve health. What to expect: A TCM practitioner will take a case history and may do a physical examination, including looking at your tongue and taking your pulse (tongue and pulse analysis), to work out the flow of energy and imbalances in your body. Treatment may include one or more of the therapies listed above. Evidence: There is clinical evidence for the benefits of some aspects of TCM for people with cancer, while for other aspects the evidence is limited. See individual therapies for further information. Holistic approaches to health care 21Ayurvedic medicine What it is: Ayurvedic medicine is an ancient Indian system that was founded on the concept that health is achieved when the mind, body and spirit are in balance. Ayurvedic practitioners use a wide range of therapies, including nutritional and herbal medicine, massage, meditation and yoga. What to expect: An Ayurvedic practitioner takes a case history and assesses vital force and balance in the body, often using tongue and pulse analysis. Treatment may include one or more of the therapies listed above.Beliefs behind TCM According to Chinese medicine and other medical systems from Asia, everyone has a vital energy or vital force known as qi (pronounced 'chee'). Qi is said to flow through the body along pathways called meridians. People who use TCM believe that if the flow of qi becomes unbalanced, this can lead to physical and emotional disease or discomfort. Qi is made up of two opposite and complementary factors known as Yin and Yang. In TCM, the belief is that there is Yin and Yang in everything. Yin is represented by water and Yang by fire. The balance of the two maintains harmony in your body, mind and the universe. TCM also uses the theory of five elements - fire, earth, metal, water and wood - to explain how the body works. These elements correspond to particular organs and tissues in the body. 22 Cancer CouncilEvidence: There is good evidence for the effectiveness of some treatments that are part of Ayurvedic medicine, such as massage, meditation and yoga. There is limited clinical evidence on the herbal remedies and certain diets used by Ayurvedic therapists. See individual therapies for further information. Homoeopathy What it is: Homoeopathy is based on the theory of 'like cures like' . It tries to stimulate the body's ability to heal itself with the consumption of small doses of highly diluted substances. In larger doses these substances would produce the illness or symptoms. Homoeopathic remedies are available as tablets, liquids or creams. See pages 56-57 for information on what to expect during a consultation and evidence for homoeopathy. Remedies from different cultures Australia's cultural diversity means some people may want to use traditional healing practices as part of their complementary cancer care. For example, some Indigenous people with cancer may want the guidance of a traditional doctor or elder who is familiar with bush medicine and Aboriginal spirituality. Talk to your doctor if you would like to use traditional remedies from your culture. Holistic approaches to health care 23Mind-body techniques Mind-body techniques are based on the belief that what we think and feel can affect our physical and mental wellbeing. Examples of mind-body techniques include support groups, counselling, hypnotherapy, relaxation, meditation, spiritual practices, life coaching, art therapy and music therapy. Some techniques, such as support groups and counselling, have now become part of standard cancer care. Spiritual practices are also discussed because of the important part they play in many people's lives and their value in providing emotional support. Mind-body techniques may also be called psychological techniques, emotional therapies or spiritual healing. The mind-body connection The mind and the body are linked. When our emotions or mental state are under pressure, our physical body can be affected. Similarly, physical symptoms can have a negative impact on our mood and mental wellbeing. Many complementary therapies focus on the mind- body connection in different ways. Acupuncture, tai chi, qi gong, yoga and massage can help with both emotional and physical problems. However, as these techniques are first directed at the physical body (e.g. moving the limbs into a certain pose), they are described further in the Body-based practices chapter (see page 35). 24 Cancer CouncilTypes of mind-body techniques Practising mind-body techniques will help to change your mental and emotional state, which can help you feel more relaxed and more able to cope with life. Mind-body techniques Support groups Counselling Art therapy Music therapy Life coaching Spiritual practices Meditation Relaxation Hypnotherapy Mind-body techniques 25Benefits: Scientific studies suggest that mind-body techniques can benefit people who have cancer or are recovering from it. Some therapies allow people to explore the emotions that friends and family may not be able to relate to. Evidence also shows that mind-body techniques may reduce the symptoms and side effects of cancer and its treatment. These include pain, anxiety, stress, low self-esteem, fear and difficulty sleeping, which can all affect mood and overall wellbeing. Using self-help techniques may help people feel more in control of their situation and less fearful of the future. Mind-body techniques give you the opportunity to discuss your thoughts, feelings and concerns in a safe and confidential environment. Y ou may find using these techniques gives you relief, or a sense of peace or understanding. Side effects: Sometimes people feel overwhelmed by the emotions they experience during or after a session. This usually settles soon afterwards. If not, contact your therapist for further support. Support groups What they are: Organised groups where people with cancer and their families can meet other people going through a similar experience. They include face-to-face and telephone support groups, online discussion forums and peer support programs. Why use them: Getting in touch with other people living with cancer can be very beneficial. Groups offer practical and emotional support and can be helpful at all stages of cancer. 26 Cancer CouncilWhat to expect: In these support settings, most people feel they can speak openly and share their experiences with others. Evidence: There is strong evidence that cancer support groups improve quality of life. Research has found that joining a group helps reduce distress, depression and anxiety. Studies have also shown benefits in people using online health forums. Relaxation and meditation What they are: Relaxation usually includes slow breathing and muscle-loosening exercises to physically and mentally calm the body. Meditation is an ancient practice that involves focusing on a single thing, such as your breathing. There are many different types of meditation. Mindfulness meditation means being aware and present in each moment, while guided imagery or visualisation use your imagination to create healing thoughts. Why use them: Relaxation and meditation may help to release muscle tension and reduce anxiety. What to expect: Lying or sitting in a comfortable position, you are led through a series of exercises that focus on breath work and calming the mind. Often, serene music is played to create a peaceful environment. After a period of relaxation, Call Cancer Council 13 11 20 for information on counselling, support programs and online discussion groups.Mind-body techniques Mind-body techniques 27Some hospitals, cancer support groups and community centres offer relaxation and meditation groups. There are also many self-help CDs, DVDs and smartphone apps that will guide you through the different techniques. Cancer Council produces relaxation and meditation CDs. Call 13 11 20 for free copies.you will usually be prompted to stay awake to enjoy your relaxed state of mind. Evidence: There is good evidence to show that relaxation and meditation lower the levels of stress hormones in your body, which can assist in healing and improving immune function. Clinical studies have shown that people being treated for cancer who practise relaxation have lower levels of anxiety, stress, pain and depression. Studies on meditation have shown it helps improve the quality of life of people with cancer, increases coping, and can reduce pain, anxiety, depression and nausea. Counselling What it is: Through discussions with a counsellor or psychologist, you can identify both positive and troubling aspects in your life. Y ou may choose to focus on your goals or your positive relationships, or you may decide to discuss particular problems or challenges you are facing. Counselling allows you to explore ways of resolving negative thoughts and feelings that impact on your health and day-to-day life. 28 Cancer CouncilWhy use it: Counselling allows you to identify, understand and express your emotions, motivations, life choices and behaviours in a safe, objective and confidential environment. It can help with self-esteem, communication and relationships. What to expect: Consultations are usually face to face, but if you live in a remote area or require crisis counselling, you may be able to talk with a counsellor over the phone or online. A counsellor will ask questions about why you have decided to speak to them and what aspects of your life you wish to talk about. They can often help you to clarify your thoughts so you can work out how to resolve any challenges yourself. Sometimes a counsellor will simply provide a non-judgemental, listening ear to allow you to talk through events that have caused you to feel negative emotions. Evidence: There is long-established evidence of the benefits of counselling. However, it is important that you find a suitably qualified counsellor you feel comfortable talking with. Ask your general practitioner (GP) for a referral. Cognitive behaviour therapy Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is a common type of talk therapy psychologists use to help people identify unhelpful thoughts and behaviours, and change how they respond to negative situations or emotions. CBT can teach you how to calm your body and mind, focus your thinking and improve your outlook. Mind-body techniques Mind-body techniques 29Differences between counsellors, psychologists and psychiatrists CounsellorA counsellor's education may range from a vocational certificate in counselling through to university-level studies in psychology, social work or counselling. There is no one standard of qualification required. Counsellors listen to clients, offer support and help them come up with strategies for managing the issues they choose to focus on. Counsellors do not prescribe medication, but if they are also qualified in a complementary therapies discipline, such as flower remedies (see page 57), they may dispense these as part of their treatment plan. PsychologistA registered psychologist in Australia must complete four years of psychology at university at an undergraduate level, followed by either postgraduate studies in psychology or two years of supervised clinical practice. Psychologists who specialise in counselling use their understanding of the working of the mind to guide people through issues with how they think, feel and learn. They cannot prescribe medication. PsychiatristA psychiatrist is a trained medical doctor who has specialised in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental illness. As well as discussing issues with a client, a psychiatrist may prescribe medication to help a range of mental and emotional conditions. See your GP for a referral to these practitioners, as you may be eligible for a Medicare rebate for some of these services. 30 Cancer CouncilHypnotherapy What it is: Deep relaxation that is used to help people become more aware of their inner thoughts. This can help them overcome mental blocks that have previously stopped them from dealing with anxiety, fear, low self-esteem, pain, insomnia and unwanted habits such as smoking. Why use it: Hypnotherapy can improve mental wellbeing and quality of life. What to expect: Y our therapist will take a case history and then lead you into a deeply relaxed state, known as an altered state of consciousness. Being in a relaxed state allows your subconscious to focus on your treatment goals, which then become more achievable for your conscious mind. Evidence: Hypnotherapy has been clinically tested with good results for helping people cope with pain, anxiety and nausea related to cancer treatment. Art therapy What it is: A way of using visual art to express feelings. An art therapist helps you explore the images you have created to encourage understanding of your emotions and concerns. Why use it: Y ou can work through issues that surface from your art. Other benefits include solving problems, improved mood and stress reduction.Mind-body techniques Mind-body techniques 31What to expect: Art therapy may be done individually or in groups - some hospitals run programs. Y ou do not need artistic talent to participate or benefit - the emphasis is on the process of producing artwork, not the end result. Y our art may be created any way: drawing, painting, collage, sculpture or digital work. Y ou will have an opportunity to discuss the work with the therapist - either the process of producing it or what the end result means to you. Evidence: Clinical studies have shown that art therapy leads to improvements in symptoms of fatigue. Anecdotal evidence suggests that it improves coping skills, emotional wellbeing and quality of life. Music therapy What it is: The use of music to improve health and wellbeing. A music therapist helps people engage with different aspects of music. Why use it: Music therapy can help people express themselves, feel more in control, focus on healing, feel less anxious, and simply enjoy themselves in the moment. The most significant change that occurred for me from art therapy was finding a way to express difficult feelings. Art therapy helped me find a way to share my experience. It was very positive. Ray (prostate cancer) 32 Cancer CouncilWhat to expect: Music therapy is used in several cancer centres around Australia. Y ou don't need to be musical to participate or benefit. The way a music therapy session is conducted will depend on the needs of the participants. Y ou may play instruments, sing or write lyrics, or you can simply listen to music and discuss how it affects you. Evidence: Some studies in people with cancer have shown that music therapy can improve quality of life and reduce side effects of treatment such as anxiety and nausea. Life coaching What it is: Life coaching is a type of counselling in which a coach works with you to set goals and work out ways to change your life to achieve them. Why use it: Life coaching allows people to make positive changes for their future. It helps people develop their personal, spiritual, physical and professional lives. What to expect: Y our life coach will help you to clarify your thoughts about what you want in life, and to reassess any beliefs or values that may have prevented you from experiencing fulfilment in the past. Sessions can be face to face, over the phone or online. Evidence: There is limited clinical evidence available about the benefits of life coaching. However, one small study has shown that it may help people cope better with life after cancer treatment.Mind-body techniques Mind-body techniques 33Spiritual practices What they are: Spirituality is a very individual concept. For some, it may mean being part of an organised religion such as Christianity, Judaism, Islam or Buddhism. For others, spirituality may reflect their own individual beliefs about the universe and their place in it, or a search for meaning and purpose to their lives. Often when people are diagnosed with cancer, the spiritual aspect of their lives becomes more important. Why use them: People often find comfort in prayer, meditation or quiet contemplation. Receiving pastoral care from a religious or spiritual adviser or a hospital chaplain can often help people, even if they are not part of an organised religion. What to expect: If you are part of a spiritual or religious community, you may benefit from: prayer or meditation groups a feeling of unity from the congregation healing services for the sick practical and spiritual support offered by members of your religious community. If you are not part of a formal community, you can seek further information and support about your area of spiritual interest from support groups, friendship groups, your local library or online. Evidence: There is growing scientific evidence of a positive link between spiritual practices and health. 34 Cancer CouncilBody-based practices Body-based practices, including energy therapies, can be divided into two categories: Passive bodywork techniques - include therapies where some form of touch or manual pressure is applied to your body or the unseen energy field surrounding your body. Examples include aromatherapy, massage and reflexology. Active exercise techniques - require you to actively undertake a series of movements to stimulate and stretch different parts of the body. Examples include yoga, tai chi and Pilates. Benefits: The benefits of body-based practices include reducing tension, anxiety, insomnia and pain, and increasing energy, vitality, quality of life and wellbeing. Exercise, even if gentle, can also improve stamina, muscle tone (strength), flexibility and agility. The exercise techniques in this chapter have a strong mind-body connection, so they benefit both physical and emotional health. Aromatherapy What it is: The use of aromatic essential oils extracted from plants for healing relaxation. They are used mainly during massage but can also be used in baths, inhalations or vaporisers (oil burners).Body-based practices are also called bodywork or physical, manual, tactile, touch, manipulative or exercise therapies. Techniques involving energy work are sometimes called energy therapies.Body-based practices Body-based practices 35INFO GRAPHIC HERETypes of body-based practices While the practitioners of body-based practices have differing techniques, they all aim to help people heal both physically and mentally, and tailor treatments to each person's specific needs. Massage Reflexology Arom atherapy Other techniques Q i gong Tai chi Yoga Acupuncture Energy therapies 36 Cancer CouncilWhy use it: When inhaled or absorbed through the skin, the oils stimulate positive effects on different systems in the body. What to expect: The aromatherapist blends essential oils and adds them to a base (carrier) oil to apply to your skin during a massage. The oils may also be used in an oil burner. Different blends have different effects on your mood or any symptoms you are experiencing, such as fatigue, pain, sleeplessness or nausea. If you find a particular aroma unpleasant, let your therapist know. Evidence: Some studies have shown that aromatherapy reduces anxiety in people with cancer. Studies in people with advanced cancer show that aromatherapy improves quality of life by aiding sleep. Oils used in bodywork Base oils and essential oils may be used in bodywork. Base (or carrier) oils allow the therapist to work on the skin easily. They are usually made from kernels or nuts, such as almonds. Some therapists use mineral oil as it is odourless. Essential oils, such as lavender or tea tree, can be added to base oils. They should not be swallowed or used directly on the skin undiluted. Different blends of essential oils are suitable for different moods and energy levels, and may help a range of ailments, such as difficulty with sleeping. Problems from oils are rare, but some people find they irritate the skin or the smell makes them feel nauseous. Let your therapist know if you have had reactions to oils in the past, or if you start to feel discomfort during a massage.Body-based practices Body-based practices 37Yoga What it is: Y oga involves performing poses with the body, slowing and deepening the breath, and focusing the mind. Y oga originated in India and is now popular around the world. There are many styles of yoga with varying intensity - from gentle, such as hatha yoga, to vigorous, such as ashtanga yoga/Iyengar. Some styles may not be suitable during some stages of cancer. Why use it: Y oga helps both physical and emotional health. What to expect: Wear comfortable clothes. Y ou may be asked to remove your shoes before entering the yoga room. Y ou usually need a yoga mat - this may be available in class. Most classes last for 1-2 hours. A typical routine involves focusing on quietening the mind and working with the breath. A session usually begins with warm-up stretches followed by a series of yoga postures, and ends with relaxation. If you're new to yoga, it is recommended you start with a beginner class. Always let your yoga teacher know of any health problems you have or treatments you're receiving so they can adjust postures and exercises to suit your needs. Y ou can also seek advice from your medical team. Books, DVDs and smartphone apps are useful if you do not have access to a yoga class or you want to do yoga at home. 38 Cancer CouncilEvidence: Clinical research has shown that yoga may improve sleep, decrease stress and enhance quality of life. The focus on breathing may also help reduce pain. Massage What it is: Massage involves moving (manipulating) muscles and rubbing or stroking soft tissues of the body. Why use it: There are many styles of massage. They all aim to promote deep relaxation in tissue by applying pressure to the muscles and pressure points of the body. This helps to release both muscular and emotional tension. Some types of massage can reduce lymphoedema (swelling caused by a build-up of lymph fluid). This is called lymphatic drainage. What to expect: The therapist uses a variety of strokes on different parts of the body. When performing massage on a person with cancer, therapists need to adjust their pressure and avoid certain areas of the body. Some styles of massage are done with you fully clothed; others require you to undress to your underwear so the therapist can use oil to move their hands over your skin more easily. Evidence: Many scientific studies have shown that massage can reduce pain, anxiety, depression and nausea in people who have had chemotherapy or surgery for cancer. Specialised lymphatic massage can help reduce the symptoms of lymphoedema. Call Cancer Council 13 11 20 for a free copy of Massage and Cancer.Body-based practices Body-based practices 39Acupuncture What it is: Acupuncturists put fine, sterile needles just under the skin into meridians (energy channels) in the body. Each meridian has many acupuncture points along its path. Why use it: Acupuncture is based on the theory that the placement of needles into certain points of the body unblocks and moves qi (energy) to strengthen vital force (see page 22) and reduce physical and emotional symptoms. The exact mechanism of acupuncture remains largely unclear. However, evidence indicates that needles may stimulate nerves to release the body's own natural chemicals, which help reduce pain or regulate the brain and other functions. What to expect: After a consultation, which may include tongue and pulse analysis, the practitioner gently positions sterile needles into points on your body. The needles are left in place for 30 seconds to 30 minutes, and may be turned. Y ou may feel a tingling or dull aching sensation, but should not feel pain. Acupuncturists may also implant and cover special needles (called press needles), which can remain in place for several days. These needles can be pressed to relieve some symptoms, such as insomnia or nausea.Some qualified and registered acupuncturists in Australia have special training and experience in treating cancer-related conditions. Ask your doctor whether this is offered at your treatment centre. 40 Cancer CouncilEvidence: The main areas of research into acupuncture for cancer are chemotherapy-related nausea and cancer pain, and some clinical trials have shown promising results. Anecdotal evidence suggests acupuncture is relaxing and reduces anxiety. Energy therapies What they are: These therapies are founded on the concept that all living beings have an energy field around them and flowing through them, and that this field can be altered or disturbed in association with illness. Energy therapies aim to restore balance to assist in healing. Techniques include: Bowen therapy polarity therapy reiki healing touch therapeutic touch. Why use them: Energy therapies are often used by people with cancer, as they are very gentle and do not require the therapist to make many heavy physical adjustments. The aim is to help increase energy levels, promote relaxation and wellbeing, and assist in overall healing. What to expect: Usually a client sits or lies down fully clothed. The therapist may gently touch you or may hold their hands slightly above your body. The aim is to use their own healing energy to identify energy imbalances and promote health. This may generate a feeling of warmth.Body-based practices Body-based practices 41Sometimes therapists perform different moves on or above the body - these are believed to stimulate the flow of energy. The session is usually very restful. Evidence: Clinical research has not proven the idea of an energy field within or surrounding the body. However, many traditional healing therapies, such as tai chi, acupuncture and yoga, are based on complex systems of meridians (energy channels) within and around the body. Anecdotal evidence also shows that energy therapies can provide a deep sense of calm and relaxation, often helping to relieve pain and anxiety, reduce stiffness and improve posture. Reflexology What it is: A form of foot and hand massage. Reflexologists believe that certain points on the feet and hands correspond to the body's internal organs and systems, like a map. Why use it: Many people find reflexology relaxing. Practitioners believe that by pressing on reflex points, meridians are unblocked and healthy changes can occur in the corresponding parts of the body. What to expect: After talking through your case history, you remove your footwear and lie down. The reflexologist works with their hands on your bare feet, possibly using cream or oil. Usually reflexology feels like a relaxing massage, although sometimes the therapist's touch can be subtle. 42 Cancer CouncilEvidence: Several clinical trials have looked at using reflexology to help with cancer symptoms such as pain, nausea and anxiety. Results are mixed and studies have involved small groups of people, so it is difficult to say whether the reflexology had any effect. Tai chi What it is: A part of traditional Chinese medicine that combines movement, breathing techniques and meditation. Movements create stability in the body, reflecting an ancient Chinese concept of balance known as Yin and Y ang (see page 22). Why use it: The breath work of tai chi is calming and meditative, while creating and holding the poses helps to loosen and strengthen the muscles. What to expect: If your class is indoors, you will probably do tai chi in bare feet, and there will be serene music playing. The class usually starts with warm-up exercises. Y ou will be shown different moves and assisted to perform them. The instructor may use names to describe the poses, for example, 'white crane spreads its wings' . The movements are simple to start with, then become progressively harder, with many parts of the body needing to move to achieve the pose. Classes end with cooling down and relaxation. Evidence: Studies have shown that tai chi improves quality of life, balance, agility, flexibility and muscle tone in cancer survivors. It can also help reduce stress.Body-based practices Body-based practices 43Qi gong What it is: Qi gong - pronounced 'chee goong' - is also part of traditional Chinese medicine. 'Qi' means one's life energy, and 'gong' means work. Qi gong combines movement with controlled breathing and meditation. Why use it: Movements performed in qi gong keep the flow of energy running through the body's energy channels. This can help generate a sense of wellbeing and peace, as well as improving both mental and physical vitality. What to expect: Wear comfortable clothes. Participants start with warm-up exercises to loosen the body. The instructor then guides you through a series of slow movements, which can range from basic to complex. The exercises, which are usually very calming, help you become more aware of your energy. Classes might also include meditation while you are lying down, sitting, standing or walking. Evidence: Clinical studies suggest that qi gong improves quality of life and reduces fatigue. Anecdotal evidence shows that it helps to reduce anxiety and improves general fitness. Qi gong was very calming and made me more aware of the energy in my body. I found it easier to learn than tai chi so I was able to do it at home as well as going to classes. Margaret (breast cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma) 44 Cancer CouncilOther active exercise techniques There are other exercise techniques you might like to explore. Although studies involving people with cancer are limited, these therapies are generally accepted as being beneficial for improving strength, flexibility, mobility, fitness and general wellbeing. Some treatment centres will have exercise physiologists and physiotherapists who are specially trained in exercise interventions for people with medical conditions and injuries. Alexander technique - Although not a type of exercise, this approach to balance and wellbeing in mind and body teaches people to be aware of the way they move and hold themselves. By changing the way people use their body, they can enhance their mental and physical functioning on many levels. Feldenkrais - This method helps people become more aware of the way they move and how this contributes to, or compensates for, bad posture, pain and mobility restrictions. By gently retraining the mind and body to be open to new possibilities in movement, people find ways to become freer and more comfortable. Resistance training or lifting weights - This active exercise technique is growing in popularity, particularly for people who have had treatment for breast cancer. Also called strength training, it involves the use of weights, weight machines at gyms and your own body weight to strengthen muscles. Research shows that breast cancer survivors with lymphoedema who participate in a supervised weightlifting program are less likely to experience worsening symptoms than people who do not do strength training. Body-based practices Body-based practices 45Pilates - A program that encourages the mind to be aware of its control over the muscles. Using awareness of your breath and posture, Pilates helps to strengthen core muscles and correct postural habits that have contributed to pain, reduced mobility and poor coordination. Cardiovascular (aerobic) exercise - This has been shown to be highly beneficial for people with cancer. It has important benefits during treatment as it may reduce the onset of side effects and their severity, maintain mood and improve energy levels. Cardiovascular exercise also helps people maintain muscle mass (strength). Studies are being conducted into its impact on recurrence (relapse) and survival in people with certain types of cancer. Call Cancer Council 13 11 20 for a free copy of Exercise for People Living with Cancer and to find out about free exercise programs for people with cancer and their carers in your area. YWCA Encore is a free eight-week program of gentle exercise and relaxation for people who have had breast cancer. Classes are available in all states and territories. Visit ywcaencore.org.au . 46 Cancer CouncilTherapies using herbs Herbal remedies have been used throughout history and in many traditional medicine systems. Herbal medicines are produced from various parts of plants containing active ingredients that can cause chemical changes in the body. Herbal preparations can be consumed or applied to the skin to treat disease and promote health. Therapies using herbs can also be called botanical medicine. Benefits: Many scientific studies have examined the effects of various herbs on people with cancer. Some remedies have been proven to reduce side effects of cancer treatment. While many remedies don't have scientific backing, historical usage suggests they may help with skin conditions and energy levels in people who have cancer. Side effects: Some herbs may cause unwanted side effects and interact with conventional cancer treatment. For more information on the effects of specific herbs and botanicals, visit the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center website, mskcc.org/ cancer-care/integrative-medicine . Therapies using herbs Do herbs cure cancer? There is no reliable scientific evidence that herbal remedies alone can cure or treat cancer. However, some plant extracts have been found to have anti-cancer effects and have been turned into chemotherapy drugs. These include vincristine from the periwinkle plant, and taxanes from the bark of the Pacific yew tree. Therapies using herbs 47info graphic hereINFO GRAPHIC HERE Chinese herbal medicineTypes of therapies using herbs Many herbs used in Western and Chinese herbal medicine have been scientifically tested for their safety and effectiveness. They can help reduce the side effects of some cancer treatments. Western herbal medicine 48 Cancer CouncilWestern herbal medicine What it is: Western herbal medicine remedies are usually made from herbs grown in Europe and North America, but some come from Asia. Why use it: Herbal preparations are often used to help with the side effects of conventional cancer treatments, such as lowering fatigue and improving wellbeing. Evidence shows they should be used in addition to conventional therapies, rather than as an alternative. What to expect: After taking a case history, the practitioner puts together a holistic picture of your health. They will look for underlying reasons for your ill health or the symptoms you have, and dispense a remedy addressing the causes and symptoms of your illness. They may give you a pre-made herbal formula or make up a blend of herbs specifically for your needs. Herbal medicines can be prepared as liquid extracts that are taken with water or as a tea (infusion). They can also be prepared as creams or tablets. Evidence: There is a wide body of research into the effectiveness and safety of many herbs, and some studies show promising results. Speak to your doctor and herbal medicine practitioner about the potential side effects of any herbal preparations.Therapies using herbs Many pharmacies and health food stores sell herbal preparations. Ask your complementary therapist or pharmacist if these are of high quality and meet Australian standards (see pages 13-14). Therapies using herbs 49 Buy or use herbal products from qualified practitioners or reputable suppliers. Ask for products that are clearly labelled in English with your name, batch number, date, quantity, dosage, directions, safety information (if applicable) and your practitioner's contact details. Avoid self-prescribing with over-the-counter products from a health food shop, pharmacy or the internet. Be aware that products from other countries that are sold over the internet are not subject to the same quality and safety regulations as those sold in Australia. Some Ayurvedic and Chinese products may contain lead, mercury and arsenic in high enough quantities to be considered toxic. Make sure you know how to prepare and take your herbs. Like conventional medicine, taking the correct dose at the right time is important for the herbal remedies to work safely. Talk to your doctor and complementary health practitioner, or call NPS MedicineWise's Medicines Line on 1300 633 424 from anywhere in Australia, Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm AEST. This service is staffed by registered nurses who provide confidential, independent information about prescription, over-the- counter and complementary medicines. Ask the practitioner for ways to mask the taste of the herbs if you find them bitter. If you suspect you have had an adverse reaction to any kind of medicine, speak to your practitioner or call the NPS MedicineWise Adverse Medicine Events Line on 1300 134 237. If the reaction is serious, call 000 or go to your nearest emergency department. 50 Cancer CouncilChinese herbal medicine What it is: Chinese herbs are a key part of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). See pages 21-22 for more information on TCM. Why use it: Herbs are given to unblock meridians, bring harmony between Yin and Y ang, and restore organ function. What to expect: The practitioner will take a case history and may do a tongue and pulse analysis to assess how your body is out of balance. They will choose a combination of herbs and foods that will help bring your body back into balance. Chinese herbalists select a combination of herbs to make their own formula, or they can dispense prepackaged herbal medicines. Herbs may be prescribed as tablets or as a blend of herbs that you make into a tea. Evidence: As with Western herbal medicine, many Chinese herbs have been scientifically evaluated for use in the general population, with some positive results. Research has suggested that some Chinese herbs are worth exploring further, but there is no strong evidence that they stop cancer growing, spreading or recurring. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist and complementary medicine practitioner if you are thinking about using herbal preparations.Therapies using herbs I don't know whether it was because I felt empowered or whether it was the remedies from my herbalist, but compared to other people I knew having the same type of conventional treatment, I felt I was faring pretty well. Esther (breast cancer) Therapies using herbs 51Safety of taking herbs during treatment Many people believe herbs are safe simply because they are natural. This is not true. Taking the wrong dose, the wrong combination or using the wrong part of the plant may cause serious side effects or toxicity. Herbs can also cause harmful interactions when used with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone therapy. Ask your treatment team which herbs and supplements are suitable to take during cancer treatment. St John's wort - This popular herb for mild to moderate depression has been shown to stop some chemotherapy drugs and other medications from working properly. It may also increase skin reactions to radiotherapy. If you are feeling depressed, ask your doctor about other treatments. Black cohosh - Herbalists often prescribe this to menopausal women who are experiencing hot flushes. While clinical trials show that black cohosh is relatively safe, it should not be used by people with liver damage. There is not enough scientific evidence to support the use of black cohosh in people with cancer. Ginkgo biloba and garlic - Studies have shown that these may have a blood-thinning effect, which can cause bleeding. This could be harmful in people with low platelet levels (e.g. from chemotherapy) or who are having surgery. Green tea - This has been shown to stop the cancer drug bortezomib (Velcade\u00ae) from working properly. Keep your complementary therapists and other health professionals informed about any herbal remedies you use before, during or after cancer treatment. Knowing all this information will help them give you the best possible care. 52 Cancer CouncilTherapies based on diet Many people with cancer who want to try complementary therapies decide to make nutritional changes. Some people want to alter their diet to help their body cope with the effects of cancer and its treatments, and to give themselves the best chance of recovery. Many therapies incorporate general dietary advice, while some have their own specific approaches to diet. Most doctors, cancer nurses and dietitians recommend eating a balanced diet. However, for some people undergoing cancer treatment, this is not always possible. An accredited practising dietitian can work with you to ensure you are meeting your nutritional needs, give you tailored advice on your nutrition and coping with any eating problems you may experience, and assist in managing side effects. Y ou can also call Cancer Council 13 11 20 for free information on eating well. Benefits: Good nutrition before, during and after treatment can help you to cope better with side effects, increase energy and maintain wellbeing. Vegetables and fruit contain not only vitamins and minerals, but also phytochemicals - natural substances such as antioxidants that may destroy cancer-causing agents (carcinogens). Some people with cancer choose Gerson therapy as an alternative treatment. Gerson therapy involves a special diet, including drinking fresh juice several times a day, taking supplements, and having coffee enemas. There is no scientific evidence that Gerson therapy is an effective treatment for cancer, and evidence shows that coffee enemas can be dangerous if used excessively.Therapies based on diet Therapies based on diet 53Cancer Council recommends people with cancer follow the Australian Dietary Guidelines of two serves of fruit and five serves of vegetables daily. Fruit and vegetables are best eaten fresh and whole rather than as a supplement or juice. Consuming a variety of both cooked and raw vegetables is recommended. Naturopathic nutrition What it is: This is a broad field of health care and provides a particular focus on the foods you eat and how they affect your health and wellbeing. This approach generally promotes the use of whole foods, organic foods and certain food types. Why use it: For your body to function efficiently, you need to eat a balanced diet of fats, proteins and carbohydrates. Y ou also need vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other nutrients found in fresh food. If you are deficient in certain nutrients, your body cannot function at its best and you may experience worse side effects from cancer treatment, develop new symptoms, or take longer to recover. What to expect: A naturopathic nutritionist develops a treatment plan that is focused on creating diets from nutrient-rich food. Y ou will be encouraged to avoid or minimise consumption of artificial flavours and chemicals. Y ou may also be prescribed specific supplements. Evidence: There is clinical evidence to show that eating a healthy, balanced diet can reduce people's cancer risk, and can help people recover from cancer treatment. 54 Cancer CouncilTherapies based on dietDifferences between nutritionists and dietitians NutritionistThe term nutritionist refers to both qualified nutrition scientists and naturopathic nutritionists. Some dietitians also call themselves nutritionists. Nutritionists working in the natural health industry should have at least a diploma of nutrition, or equivalent, from a university or naturopathic college. Those working within a naturopathic framework are usually employed in private practice or in a holistic medical or complementary therapies centre. Practitioners will approach dietary issues differently according to their level of training and qualifications. DietitianTo become accredited, dietitians need university qualifications in science, nutrition and dietetics. Using scientific evidence, they modify people's diets to help treat disease symptoms and to get the most out of food without the use of supplements. They often work within a conventional medical framework in hospitals, aged care facilities and medical practices. For cancer patients, a dietitian works out specialised diets, helps with weight issues, and makes sure you are adequately nourished if you have eating difficulties. You may be given supplements if you are unable to meet your nutritional requirements through diet alone. You might see a dietitian when you go to hospital, or privately after your treatment. If your GP refers you to a dietitian as part of a Chronic Disease Management Plan, you may be eligible for a Medicare rebate. Therapies based on diet 55Other therapies Homoeopathic remedies and flower essence remedies are not the same, but they are both diluted substances that contain no measurable amount of the original ingredient. Scientists are unsure how homoeopathic and flower remedies affect the body. However, because the preparations are usually highly diluted, they do not appear to interact with drugs and are generally considered safe to use with conventional treatments. Benefits: Homoeopathy and flower essences are said to work by balancing the mind and body, and by addressing emotional or spiritual needs. This positively affects the internal (biochemical) functioning of the body. These therapies are used to treat anxiety, insomnia, irritability or depression, as well as common ailments such as headache and muscle soreness. Side effects: Homoeopathic and flower remedies tend not to cause side effects because they are extremely diluted. However, if you feel you have experienced a reaction, you should stop taking the remedy and contact your practitioner or doctor for advice. Homoeopathy What it is: A system of health care based on the idea that 'like cures like' . Y ou are given a substance that causes similar symptoms in a healthy body to the symptoms you are experiencing. This is said to stimulate energy in the body that relieves the symptoms of ill health. Homoeopathic remedies are made from plant, mineral and animal substances that are diluted in water. 56 Cancer CouncilWhy use it: Homoeopathy is a gentle way to restore vitality and reduce emotional imbalances in the body. What to expect: A homoeopath takes a case history that considers not only your medical history, but also the kind of person you are and how you respond physically and emotionally to your symptoms. A remedy is chosen and prescribed as liquid drops or tablets, which are taken throughout the day. Y ou may also be given a cream for your skin, if appropriate. Evidence: Anecdotal evidence shows that homoeopathy may help improve the physical and emotional wellbeing of people with cancer. However, scientific studies have shown mixed results. Some suggest that homoeopathy may help ease menopausal symptoms of women with breast cancer. However, as these studies were relatively small and of low quality, the results can't be relied on. Flower remedies What they are: Also known as flower essences, these are highly diluted extracts from the flowers of wild plants. There are many types of flower remedies from around the world. The most well known in Australia are the Original Bach Flower Remedies, developed in the 1930s in England, and Australian Bush Flower Essences\u00ae, developed in Australia in the 1980s.Other therapiesSee pages 13-14 for information about the regulation of medicines, including flower remedies and homoeopathy. Other therapies 57Why use them: Flower remedies are used to balance the mind, body and spirit and help you cope with emotional problems, which can sometimes contribute to poor health. What to expect: Much like a counselling session, the therapist will ask questions and listen to you talk about yourself, the problems you are experiencing and how you feel about or approach certain situations. This enables the therapist to prepare a remedy - usually a blend of essences - tailored specifically for you, which is taken in water several times a day. Evidence: Scientific evidence does not support the use of flower remedies for treating diseases. However, anecdotal evidence suggests they are helpful for reducing fear, anxiety or depression. After surgery, I was so fearful that the cancer would return. My naturopath gave me Bach Flower Remedies for fear, shock and exhaustion. These helped me relax and I became more realistic about my situation. Louise (bowel cancer) 58 Cancer CouncilMaking treatment decisions Sometimes it is difficult to decide on the type of treatment to have. Y ou may feel that everything is happening too fast. Check with your doctor how soon your treatment should start, and take as much time as you can before making a decision. Understanding the disease, the available treatments and possible side effects can help you weigh up the pros and cons of different treatments and make a well-informed decision that's based on your personal values. Y ou may also want to discuss the options with your doctor, complementary health practitioner, friends and family. Y ou have the right to accept or refuse any treatment offered. Some people with more advanced cancer choose treatment even if it offers only a small benefit for a short period of time. Others want to make sure the benefits outweigh the side effects so they have the best possible quality of life. Deciding whether to use complementary therapies and which ones to choose is a similar process to deciding on a course of conventional treatment. Some people with cancer may feel pressure from friends and family to use complementary therapies, and may feel guilty if the therapy they choose doesn't offer any benefit. Some people will consider complementary therapies at the time of their diagnosis; others will not think about using them until later, perhaps as part of their supportive or palliative care. Cancer Council warns against delaying or stopping conventional treatment in favour of an alternative therapy. Making treatment decisions 59Choosing complementary therapies Weigh up the different types of treatments Find out more about different therapies Discuss your concerns Think about what you expect to gain from using complementary therapies. Consider the possible side effects of complementary therapies, how these might affect you, and how they may interact with your conventional treatments. Consider whether you prefer to use complementary therapies with strong scientific evidence, or whether anecdotal evidence is enough for you. Think about the costs of treatments (see pages 64-65). Speak to your doctor, other health professionals and complementary therapists. Discuss the issue with your family and friends. Talk to other people who have tried these treatments, for example, at a support group or through Cancer Connections (see page 68). Contact a natural therapy association to find practitioners in your area or to verify their qualifications and experience (see pages 70-71). Borrow books on the topic from a library or read about therapies on recommended websites (see page 72). Talk to your practitioner or doctor about the therapies you would like to try, and if there are any potential interactions or side effects when they are used with your conventional treatments. Seek a second opinion if you are not happy with the information you are given. 60 Cancer CouncilFinding a complementary therapist Contacting a professional association is a good starting point for finding a therapist (see list on pages 70-71). Many people find good therapists through recommendations from family or friends or through a support group. Some registered health professionals (e.g. doctors, nurses, pharmacists) are also qualified in a complementary therapy such as nutritional and herbal medicine, hypnotherapy, counselling, acupuncture or massage. Confirm that the therapist is willing to communicate with your doctors about your treatment. This is particularly important if you see a practitioner who may use remedies that might interfere with conventional treatment. Check whether the therapist would like to see your test results, a list of medications you're taking, or your conventional treatment plan. This information reduces the risk of them dispensing remedies or other treatments that might interact with your conventional medicines or treatments. Ask for a written treatment plan outlining the remedies and dietary or lifestyle changes recommended. Keep a record of your consultations, including the treatments given and medicines or supplements you have been prescribed. Write down any questions you have or use the question checklist on pages 73-76. Take someone with you to appointments to offer support, get involved in the discussion, take notes or simply listen. See the glossary on pages 77-83 if there is a word you don't understand. Making treatment decisions 61Can I help myself or should I see a professional? One of the reasons people with cancer use complementary therapies is because it helps them take an active role in their health. Some simple ways people can help themselves, without the guidance of a professional, include learning gentle massage or acupressure techniques, adding essential oils to their bath, meditating, or drinking herbal tea. Some people may consider self-prescribing herbs or nutritional supplements. Although this may seem like a cheaper alternative, it may not be safe. The benefits of seeing a professional complementary therapist are that they: are qualified in the therapy or medicine you are considering have an objective view of your case have experience treating a range of conditions and may have treated other people with cancer are able to liaise with your clinicians, as necessary can prepare a tailor-made treatment plan and dispense remedies based on your individual needs, if they are qualified to do so can help you avoid the health risks of using complementary therapies that may interact with conventional cancer treatment. Many websites offer a range of complementary medicines that may be less expensive than those you can purchase in Australia. However, the safety and quality regulations that apply to commercial products sold in Australia do not cover products purchased from overseas. See pages 13-14 for more information. 62 Cancer CouncilKeeping your health care providers informed It is important that you let your primary health care providers (e.g. GP , nurses, specialists) know you are considering using complementary therapies. This will help reduce the risk of adverse reactions. Studies show that most people with cancer who use complementary therapies don't discuss this with their primary health care providers because they worry their doctors will disapprove. The use of complementary therapies to manage a range of health conditions is growing, so many primary health care providers are now better informed about them and are often supportive of their use. Some doctors and nurses have also been trained in complementary therapies and are able to give you accurate information about them. It is important to discuss your interest in complementary therapies with your doctors and nurses, even if they aren't supportive of their use. It allows them to consider your safety and wellbeing. For example, your surgeon, oncologist or radiotherapist may have specific concerns, such as not using particular creams or medicines at certain times during your treatment. If you are taking herbs or nutritional supplements, they may suggest you stop taking these before, during or after particular treatments. To keep your doctors and nurses better informed, ask your complementary therapist to provide a letter outlining the type of therapy you are receiving. It is also important to tell your complementary therapist that you have cancer, and advise them of the treatment you're having. Making treatment decisions 63Talking with others Y ou may want to discuss your different treatment options with family or friends, medical practitioners, nursing staff, the hospital social worker or chaplain, your own religious or spiritual adviser, a cancer support group or Cancer Council 13 11 20. Talking it over can help you sort out the course of action that best suits you. A second opinion Just as you may want to get a second opinion from another specialist about your conventional cancer treatment, you might want to see a few different complementary therapists to compare how they would approach your treatment. After consulting with a complementary therapist, you may decide you don't want to continue seeing them because you are not sure they can offer you the right supportive treatment for your individual case. Getting a second opinion can be a valuable part of your overall decision-making process and can help you feel comfortable about any complementary treatments you choose to have. Costs Consultation costs for complementary therapies vary depending on the training and experience of the practitioner, the length of the consultation, and the treatment provided. The standard fee for a private complementary health practitioner is about $80 to $140 per hour, which does not include the cost of herbal remedies, essential oils, nutritional supplements or other products. 64 Cancer CouncilNaturopaths, herbalists and homoeopaths may dispense remedies that they mix for you, or they may sell you pre-made nutritional, herbal or homoeopathic supplements. Prices vary depending on the type of remedy and the ingredients, strength and quantity. Consider speaking to a few practitioners to compare costs. If you have private health insurance, check whether you are eligible for a rebate on the cost of the consultation with a complementary therapist. Most funds do not provide a rebate on the cost of any remedies or supplements that you purchase. Some complementary therapies can be claimed under Medicare if you have a referral from your GP as part of a Chronic Disease Management Plan. Taking part in a clinical trial Funding for clinical trials or research into the effectiveness and safety of complementary therapies is limited. Because of the growing popularity of complementary therapies in Australia, the National Institute of Complementary Medicine was established by the federal government to promote research in this area of health care. Some universities and hospitals are also involved in research and clinical trials. Y our hospital or support group may provide opportunities for you to take part in clinical trials and research involving the use of complementary therapies. Before deciding whether or not to join a clinical trial, discuss the questions on the following page with your doctor and a qualified complementary therapies practitioner. Making treatment decisions 65 What treatments are being tested and why? What tests are involved? Can I take part in the trial while having conventional treatment? What are the possible risks or side effects? What are the possible benefits? How long will the trial last? What will I do if problems occur while I am in the trial? Has an independent ethics committee approved the trial? If you join a clinical trial for conventional cancer treatment, it is important to check whether using any complementary therapies could impact on the trial results. Speak to your doctor and/or complementary therapist for information. If you decide to take part in a clinical trial, you can withdraw at any time. For more information, call Cancer Council 13 11 20 or visit australiancancertrials.gov.au . I was on a clinical trial when I decided to see a naturopath, who suggested I take coconut oil. The doctor on the trial said it shouldn't have an impact on my other medication.
