Emergency Management Directors oversee emergency planning and processes to reduce health risks during urgent situations, such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks, disease breakouts, and other situations. Unlike other public health workers who focus on research and education, these professionals plan for acute and long-term responses to immediate health threats and concerns. After an emergency situation occurs, these employees analyze current data and adapt responses to further reduce population risks. Source: [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes119161.htm) Most entry-level roles in emergency management can be obtained with a bachelor's degree. However, if you plan on specializing in vaccine research, clinical treatment, public policy administration, bioterrorism, or some of the other specialities explored later in this guide, then you will most likely need to pursue a master's degree or higher. These advanced roles often place an emphasis on lab research and scientific expertise. Generally, you need to gain multiple years of experience in high-stress jobs in law enforcement, fire safety, and medicine before you can become an emergency management director. These roles help prepare you to react efficiently during a crisis situation where quick decisions need to be made for communities and large-scale populations. A thorough understanding of the populations you're working with is preferred. These specialists respond to environmental situations that pose great risk to the human populations and natural resources. Individuals in this profession are typically employed by the U.S. Armed Forces, National Guard, or other federal agencies. Environmental health emergency response specialists may be required to receive certain certifications, depending on their specialization.

Those who work with radioactive, toxic, or otherwise dangerous materials may be required to obtain a [hazardous materials certificate](http://www.ihmm.org/) (which are typically awarded at the state level). These emergency management professionals dedicate their lab research to forecasting potential outbreaks and vaccine resistance, or studying data from current emergencies. They often work in government agency laboratories or at academic institutions. This specialization has no additional requirements. These scientists research biological weapon release mechanisms and effects in order to prepare for possible terrorist threats that use diseases, toxins, and other harmful biological substances.
