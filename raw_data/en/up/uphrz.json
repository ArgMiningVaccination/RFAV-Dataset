(2) The Community legislation so far adopted has made amajor contribution to the achievement of the objectiveof the free and safe movement of medicinal products forhuman use and the elimination of obstacles to trade insuch products. However, in the light of the experienceacquired, it has become clear that new measures arenecessary to eliminate the remaining obstacles to freemovement. (3) It is therefore necessary to align the national laws, regu-lations and administrative provisions which containdifferences with regard to the basic principles in orderto promote the operation of the internal market whilerealising a high level of human health protection.(4) The main purpose of any regulation on the manufactureand distribution of medicinal products for human use should be to safeguard public health. However, this objective should be achieved by means which do nothinder the development of the pharmaceutical industryor trade in medicinal products in the Community. (5) Article 71 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 of22 July 1993 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing aEuropean Agency for the Evaluation of MedicinalProducts ( 5) provided that, within six years of its entry into force, the Commission was required to publish ageneral report on the experience acquired as a result ofthe operation of the marketing authorisation procedureslaid down in that Regulation and in other Communitylegal provisions. (6) In the light of the Commission's report on theexperience acquired, it has proved necessary toimprove the operation of the marketing authorisationprocedures for medicinal products in the Community. (7) Particularly as a result of scientific and technicalprogress, the definitions and scope of Directive2001/83/EC should be clarified in order to achievehigh standards for the quality, safety and efficacy ofmedicinal products for human use. In order to takeaccount both of the emergence of new therapies andof the growing number of so-called 'borderline'products between the medicinal product sector andother sectors, the definition of 'medicinal product'should be modified so as to avoid any doubt as to theapplicable legislation when a product, whilst fully fallingwithin the definition of a medicinal product, may alsofall within the definition of other regulated products.This definition should specify the type of action thatthe medicinal product may exert on physiological functions. This enumeration of actions will also make it possible to cover medicinal products such as genetherapy, radiopharmaceutical products as well ascertain medicinal products for topical use. Also, inview of the characteristics of pharmaceutical legislation,provision should be made for such legislation to apply.With the same objective of clarifying situations, where agiven product comes under the definition of a medicinalproduct but could also fall within the definition of otherregulated products, it is necessary, in case of doubt andin order to ensure legal certainty, to state explicitlywhich provisions have to be complied with. Where aproduct comes clearly under the definition of otherproduct categories, in particular food, food supplements,EN L 136/34 Official Journal of the European Union 30.4.2004 (1) OJ C 75 E, 26.3.2002, p. 216 and OJ C . . .

Regulation repealed by Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 (see p. 1 of this Official Journal).medical devices, biocides or cosmetics, this Directive should not apply. It is also appropriate to improve theconsistency of the terminology of pharmaceutical legis-lation. (8) Wherever it is proposed to change the scope of thecentralised procedure, it should no longer be possibleto opt for the mutual-recognition procedure or thedecentralised procedure in respect of orphan medicinalproducts and medicinal products which contain newactive substances and for which the therapeutic indi-cation is the treatment of acquired immune deficiencysyndrome, cancer, neurodegenerative disorder ordiabetes. Four years after the date of entry into forceof Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 ( 1), it should no longer be possible to opt for the mutual-recognitionprocedure or the decentralised procedure in respect ofmedicinal products which contain new active substancesand for which the therapeutic indication is the treatmentof auto-immune diseases and other immunedysfunctions and viral diseases. (9) On the other hand, in the case of generic medicinalproducts of which the reference medicinal product hasbeen granted a marketing authorisation under thecentralised procedure, applicants seeking marketingauthorisation should be able to choose either of thetwo procedures, on certain conditions. Similarly, themutual-recognition or decentralised procedure shouldbe available as an option for medicinal products whichrepresent a therapeutic innovation or which are ofbenefit to society or to patients. (10) In order to increase availability of medicinal products, in particular on smaller markets, it should, in cases where an applicant does not apply for an authorisation for amedicinal product in the context of the mutual-recog-nition procedure in a given Member State, be possiblefor that Member State, for justified public health reasons,to authorise the placing on the market of the medicinalproduct. (11) Evaluation of the operation of marketing authorisationprocedures has revealed the need to revise, in particular,the mutual-recognition procedure in order to improvethe opportunities for cooperation between MemberStates. This cooperation process should be formalisedby setting up a coordination group for this procedure and by defining its operation so as to settle disagreements within the framework of a revised decen-tralised procedure. (12) With regard to referrals, the experience acquired revealsthe need for an appropriate procedure, particularly inthe case of referrals relating to an entire therapeuticclass or to all medicinal products containing the sameactive substance.(13) There is a need to provide for the ethical requirementsof Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament andthe Council of 4 April 2001 on the approximation ofthe laws, regulations and administrative provisions ofthe Member States relating to the implementation ofgood clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trialson medicinal products for human use ( 2) to apply to all medicinal products authorised within the Community. In particular, with respect to clinical trials conducted outside the Community on medicinalproducts destined to be authorised within theCommunity, it should be verified, at the time of theevaluation of the application for authorisation, thatthese trials were conducted in accordance with the prin-ciples of good clinical practice and the ethicalrequirements equivalent to the provisions of thatDirective. (14) Since generic medicines account for a major part of themarket in medicinal products, their access to theCommunity market should be facilitated in the light of the experience acquired. Furthermore, the period for protection of data relating to pre-clinical tests andclinical trials should be harmonised. (15) Biological medicinal products similar to a referencemedicinal product do not usually meet all the conditionsto be considered as a generic medicinal product mainlydue to manufacturing process characteristics, rawmaterials used, molecular characteristics and therapeuticmodes of action. When a biological medicinal productdoes not meet all the conditions to be considered as ageneric medicinal product, the results of appropriatetests should be provided in order to fulfil therequirements related to safety (pre-clinical tests) or to efficacy (clinical tests) or to both. (16) The criteria of quality, safety and efficacy should enable the risk-benefit balance of all medicinal products to beassessed both when they are placed on the market andat any other time the competent authority deems thisappropriate. In this connection, it is necessary toharmonise and adapt the criteria for refusal, suspensionand revocation of marketing authorisations. (17) A marketing authorisation should be renewed once five years after the granting of the marketing authorisation. Thereafter, the marketing authorisation should normallybe of unlimited validity. Furthermore, any authorisationnot used for three consecutive years, that is to say onewhich has not led to the placing on the market of amedicinal product in the Member States concernedduring that period, should be considered invalid, inorder, in particular, to avoid the administrative burdenof maintaining such authorisations. However,exemptions from this rule should be granted whenthese are justified on public health grounds.EN 30.4.2004 Official Journal of the European Union L 136/35 (1) See p. 1 of this Official Journal. (2) OJ L 121, 1.5.2001, p. 34.(18) The environmental impact should be assessed and, on a case-by-case basis, specific arrangements to limit itshould be envisaged. In any event this impact shouldnot constitute a criterion for refusal of a marketingauthorisation. (19) The quality of medicinal products for human use manu-factured or available in the Community should beguaranteed by requiring that the active substances usedin their composition comply with the principles of good manufacturing practice in relation to those medicinal products. It has proved necessary to reinforce theCommunity provisions on inspections and to compilea Community register of the results of those inspections. (20) Pharmacovigilance and, more generally, marketsurveillance and sanctions in the event of failure tocomply with the provisions should be stepped up. Inthe field of pharmacovigilance, account should betaken of the facilities offered by new information tech-nologies to improve exchanges between Member States. (21) As part of the proper use of medicinal products, therules on packaging should be adapted to take accountof the experience acquired. (22) The measures necessary for the implementation of thisDirective should be adopted in accordance with CouncilDecision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying downthe procedures for the exercise of implementingpowers conferred on the Commission ( 1).
