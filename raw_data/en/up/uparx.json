Glassman, author of \"Brain Drain: The Breakthrough That Will Change Your Life\" \"EATING YOUR MEDICINE\" AND PROMOTING A NATURAL WELLNESS APPROACH IS BIG BUSINESS \u2014 AND GROWING EVERY YEAR. Older Americans are projected to outnumber children for the first time in U.S. history come 2030, when all baby boomers will be age 65 or older, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. At this point, one out of every five U.S. residents will be of retirement age. Baby boomers and Generation X-age adults have bought into wellness, as chiropractors who cater to this demographic can attest. The U.S. health and wellness market, which ranks No. 1 globally according to the Global Wellness Institute, will reach approximately $179 billion in 2020, according to Statista. Friend or foe? In this issue we take a look at \"eating your medicine\" in regard to chiropractors' nemesis \u2014 inflammation \u2014 or is it? Is inflam - mation a disease, or a body's healthy response to challenges the body is facing, protecting it from injury? Natural anti-inflammatory herbs and medicines are gaining favor with patients over non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) which carpet-bomb the body and can delay healing in addition to fighting inflammation. In our feature you'll learn more about the roles fatty acids and botanicals play in inflammation, and how we should view the body's natural responses and inflammation. Also in this issue along the lines of natural medicine, we look at the seemingly ever-expanding uses of curcumin, new applications in joint pain relief, treating weekend warriors, a detailed approach for report of findings, and much more. As our feature author says, chances are you have experienced the effects of inflammation on your body, as a doctor, at some point. Perhaps looking at inflammation from a new angle can provide new insights to your treatment protocols and patient offerings. RIP Jack Dolbin, Jr. It is always sad when the industry loses a chiropractor who has devoted his life to the practice. For Jack Dolbin, Jr., chiropractic was not a lifelong practice, but began after he completed four years in the NFL as a wide receiver for the Denver Broncos. After his football career Dolbin became a chiropractor, educator and lecturer. He died in August at the age of 70.

Science Based Nutrition Tough Case 733: In July a joint report from the American Black Chiropractic Association (ABCA) and the International Chiropractors Association (ICA), \"Advancing Diversity as We Advance the Chiropractic Profession,\" was announced during the Semi-Annual Meeting of the Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE). The report calls for increasing diversity through engagement with academic program accreditation organizations, citing 2.3% black chiropractors in the U.S. serving a Black/African population in the U.S. of 13.8%, according to the 2018 U.S. Census. The report also stresses diversity trends, noting that \"more children in the United States under the age of five years of age [are] minorities rather than white, while the overall chiropractic profession in the U.S. is 92% white.\" From health care stakeholders the report notes that there is a call to achieve greater racial diversity in health professions across the board. Colleges taking diversity measures Several chiropractic colleges, according to the study, have taken specific measures to increase diversity: in 2011, Texas Chiropractic College (TCC) entered into a 3+3 agreement with Dillard University, a historically black university in which students attend Dillard for three years, and TCC for three years. Upon completion, the students receive a bachelor's degree from Dillard and a chiropractic doctorate from TCC. And in 2019, Logan Chiropractic College entered into a 3+3 agreement with Grambling State University, an historically black university, similar to the TCC-Dillard agreement.\"In other professions, including the physician workforce, achieving diversity remains a challenge,\" said Past President of the American Black Chiropractic Association, Winston Carhee, DC, in January of this year. \"Both public and private institutions are making investments in programs to continue to improve diversity in the health care workforce. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding programs and best practices.\" Strategies to recruit minorities At a January 2019 meeting the ABCA requested the CCE develop and support opportunities in chiropractic admission criteria not only focused on grade point average, test scores, or time to complete a program, but to allow consideration of minority students' experiences and attributes. The ABCA also requested the CCE create and support policies and practices that help to develop strategies to recruit minority faculty members to match the population needs, and to develop college environments that better support students of color and focus on minority recruitment efforts. The study, \"Advancing Diversity as We Advance the Chiropractic Profession,\" was authored by President of the American Black Chiropractic Association Quentin M. Brisco, DC; Immediate Past President of the ABCA Winston Carhee, DC; President of the International Chiropractors Association Stephen P.

MEDICINE.\" \u2014TIM MINCHINAmericans are overexposed to products that are high in energy, saturated fat, sugar and salt, according to a new Northwestern Medicine study that reports the United States packaged food and beverage supply in 2018 was ultra-processed and generally unhealthy. Since about 80% of Americans' total calorie consumption comes from store-bought foods and beverages (packaged and unpackaged), the food and beverage supply plays a central role in the development of chronic disease. The study was published July 24 in the journal Nutrients . It aims to provide new information for consumers, researchers and policymakers to encourage food manufacturers to reformulate or replace unhealthy products and to inform the U.S. government on where action may be needed to improve the healthfulness of the U.S. packaged food and beverage supply. The scientists in this study ranked foods based on their healthfulness number defined by a Health Star Rating system. Linda Van Horn, PhD, RD, chief of nutrition in the department of preventive medicine and a professor of nutrition at Feinberg School of Medicine, also is a study co-author.

Part of this is an increased interest in nutritional supplements to help boost brainpower and memory. Such supplements are known as nootropics. Nootropics, sometimes known as smart drugs, are synthetic or natural compounds that improve cognitive function, creativity, memory, motivation and attention. Two examples of natural nootropic compounds that are not supplements are caffeine and nicotine, which is why both can make you feel more alert. Korean ginseng root ( Panax ginseng ) is probably one of the best-known natural nootropic supplements. Another popular nootropic supplement is Ginkgo biloba . More people are seeking ways to improve their memory and delay loss of cognitive function. Nootropic supplements, such as ginseng and ginkgo biloba, may help them do just that. \u2014 Tina BeychokSTAFF PICK BROAD-SPECTRUM BENEFITS Metagenics Hemp Oil Why we love it This organic, non-GMO, gluten-free and vegetarian oil is broad-spectrum, sourced from aerial parts of the hemp plant \u2014 stalk, stems, seeds and flower \u2014 and designed to support overall health.

While inflammation often has a bad reputation, it may be a healthy response to challenges your body faces, such as infection, illness or injury. Acute inflammation, for example, is a normal, protective response to injury. H owever, inflammation can become your enemy if it is causing your body to overreact to stressors, creating a chronic, continuing natural inflammation response. Your lifestyle habits, including diet, nutrition and exercise, may affect the way your body addresses these challenges. T he idea of using an \"anti-inflammatory\" medication, such as a non-steroidal anti- inflammatory medication (NSAID) to address inflammation, has begun to lose favor, because if inflammation is artificially interrupted or blocked, healing is also blocked. B y contrast, nutrients like essential fatty acids are not necessarily anti- or pro-inflammatory; instead, they modulate inflammation on a case-by-case basis, up- or down-regulating the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. This balances inflammatory processes so that healing can occur without undue damage to surrounding tissues.THE TAKEAWAY That dirty word inflammation is a natural response to your body facing a challenge, and only becomes an enemy when it is not dealt with properly and causes a body to overreact, and over time creates a chronic condition. But patients can counteract inflammation through proper diets and supplementation.INFLAMMATION IS YOUR FRIEND? Considering a natural, nutritional approach to 'anti-inflammatory' medicine BY JOHN TROUP, PHD TIME TO READ: 6-8 MIN. CHIROECO.COM SEPTEMBER 3, 2019 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 19Essential fatty acids and inflammation balancing Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids have been front and center in nutrition news for many years now because of their relation - ship with cardiovascular health. But, their role in modulating all types of inflammation in the body makes these fats even more important for healthy diets and lifestyles. Omega-3s and omega-6s work together to modulate inflammation with a system of checks and balances built into place. When the diet provides a good balance of high-quality omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, this system works well to perpetuate inflammation when necessary and to quell and resolve the inflammatory cascade when the threat is over. Most Western diets have an overabundance of omega-6 fatty acids and include insufficient amounts of omega-3s. High omega-6 and low omega-3 intake can throw off the balance, resulting in continuously low levels of chronic inflammation. Enriching your omegas diet The most bioavailable source of omega-3 fatty acids are oils from fatty fish, especially sardines, anchovies, tuna, mackerel and salmon. A nutrient is \"bioavailable\" or \"bioactive\" when it is in a form where it can provide health benefits in the human body. Nut and seed oils also are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, though their conversion to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may not be as efficient as those from fish. Omega-6 fatty acids tend to be more plentiful in many people's diets, which can also affect how well omega-3 fatty acids convert to EPA and DHA.FEATURE STORY Nutrients like essential fatty acids are not necessarily anti- or pro-inflammatory; instead, they modulate inflammation on a case-by-case basis.

Hemp has long been used in food, fiber and medicine production ever since it originated from Central Asia. Hemp is rich with essential nutrients and bioactive phytochemical metabolites that nurture the endocannabinoid system, a rather unknown system of the body with a heavy influence on human health and well-being. Hemp contains beneficial amounts of bioactive phytochemical metabolites and essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which promote brain and overarching systemic health, aligning physiological balance in the human body. This includes omega-3s and omega-6s. Along with natural antioxidants and fiber obtained via phytonutrients and other parts of a healthy, whole-food diet, hemp can support healthy inflammation. Essential fatty acids Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are long-chain PUFAs, both 18 carbons long with two double bonds. Omega-3s and omega-6s work together to modulate inflammation with a system of checks and balances built into place. The Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and individual states continue to struggle with decriminalizing hemp and CBD, as almost all 50 states have regulated hemp and CBD products to some extent. As of this printing, the only FDA-approved use of CBD is the seizure drug Epidiolex. Heading into August, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill into law decriminalizing hemp and CBD products and paving the way for the development of hemp in the state. Ohio became the 47th state to regulate hemp, and the Ohio Farm Bureau predicts hemp will quickly become the state's third-largest crop behind corn and soybeans. In New York City the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (Department of Health) recently banned the sale of food and beverages containing cannabidiol (CBD), sending retailers scrambling to get it off the shelves and out of their food and beverage offerings. Despite the FDA passage of the 2018 Farm Bill and legalization of hemp, the addition of CBD to food and drink products remains illegal. The FDA in May held a public comment hearing on hemp and CBD as a first step in developing regulations for edible CBD products. But some critics believe the regulations may take years to come about, and some local authorities like those in New York City are not willing to wait in the gray area that many in the chiropractic industry are referring to as the \"Wild West\" of CBD sales and claims. According to law.com, the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources recently banned the sale of foods infused with CBD and dietary supplements, along with Maine and Ohio, rather than keeping them in the gray area. In June the Louisiana Office of Alcohol and Tobacco Control (ATC) issued a \"declaration of emergency\" that effectively would make selling certain cannabidiol (CBD) products illegal, such as vape cartridges and food and beverages containing CBD. Louisiana retailers and manufacturers have until September to sell off their inventory. In July, FDA Principal Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernathy and Principal Associate Commissioner for Policy Lowell Schiller recognized the public interest in CBD products while explaining, \"there are many unanswered questions about the science, safety, and quality of many of these products,\" according to law.com. Abernathy late in July noted the FDA's plan \"to report our progress by early this fall as [the FDA] expedite[s]...work related to CBD products...\" via social media, emphasizing the FDA's science-based approach.CBD LEGISLATION UPDATE 22 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS SEPTEMBER 3, 2019 CHIROECO.COMFor only $100 per month, your contribution helps to educate your patients, grow your practice and advance the profession.

Therefore, they must be consumed in the diet. Omega-3 fatty acids include alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and its metabolites, EPA and DHA. Omega-6 fatty acids include linoleic acid (LA) and its most notable metabolites, gammalinolenic acid (GLA) and arachidonic acid (AA). Botanicals for inflammation Herbs can also have a useful role in the management of inflammation and inflammation-generated pain. However, the selection of anti-inflammatory herbs needs to be appropriate to the condition under treatment. Adaptogens are a diverse group of herbs that restore overall balance and functioning of the body as a whole through normalizing unbalanced physiological processes: stimulation, relaxation and improving focus and immune function. These herbs have been shown to clinically reduce self-reported stress, improve mood and energy and strengthen the immune system. Adaptogens are often particularly helpful in stress-related conditions due to their shielding effects on the brain, immune system and cardiopulmonary systems. Some, such as ginseng, ashwagandha and rhodiola, are specifically neuroprotective by blunting the impact of cortisol within the central nervous system by reducing neuro-inflammation and even encouraging repair. In addition, nervines (examples include organic skullcap, oat tops, catnip, chamomile, valerian root) are a class of botanicals that reduce sympathetic overdrive, anxiety and irritability by sedating the autonomic nervous system and inducing a sense of calm or relaxation. They can be used during the day to blunt a hyper-aroused state or in the evening for sleep induction.

PRACTICE CENTRAL THE REPORT OF FINDINGS IS THE CUMULATIVE BYPRODUCT OF MANY ASPECTS OF A CHIROPRACTOR'S BELIEF SYSTEM , confidence, knowledge and compassion for the patient. It's a culmination of everything, and the patient will know immedi - ately if this is an office they feel good about or not. A variety of objectives need to occur at the report, and if all of the critical objectives are met, the report will usually end up successful. The first goal is to educate the patient enough so they'll more clearly understand their problem. So, the first step is always to remind them of Crooked Man (Fig. 1). You can tell them this is every human, that everyone's imbalances originate in the feet, and that there is a domino-like effect going up the structure. THE TAKEAWAY The report of findings is an opportunity to align a patient's goals for healing and correction with your objective results. Patient education is a part of the process, including a series of questions leading to an appropriate set of recommendations that match a patient's lifestyle. 26 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS SEPTEMBER 3, 2019 CHIROECO.COMIt begins with the feet Humans are architectural structures influenced by gravity, aging and stresses. \"So, let's look at your feet.\" We then go to the monitor of our digital foot scanner and point out the optimal feet (Fig. 2) and explain that the red represents the weight-bearing portion of the foot (Fig. 3). In most cases, the patient's feet have collapsed to some degree, and the response to them is, \"We have to fix the feet if we're hoping to fix your problem.\" With the patient also looking at Crooked Man, this makes perfect sense to them. To fix the feet, we use custom orthotics. When you put custom orthotics in your shoes, your imbalanced feet will now act like the optimal feet. \"So, the feet are easy to fix .\" We then move to the A-P L-S X-ray which was taken in the standing position with bare PRACTICE CENTRAL (FIG. 1)WE WANT TO HELP YOU.

(Fig. 4) The first reference point we use is femoral head height. With digital X-ray, we can be very accurate in any difference that may occur. We consider 2 millimeters and under as normal. However, even if the femoral heads are under 2 millimeters different in height, it doesn't guarantee the feet are actually level. We've now learned that femoral head height when barefoot rarely equals femoral head height with custom orthotics in the shoes. So, we tell the patient that we know the femoral head heights generally change in some way, either for better or worse, once we put orthotics in their shoes. You can tell the patient, \" If you decide to get the orthotics, when they come in we'll put them in your shoes and re-take this X-ray to determine if a lift is needed in either shoe, as our goal is to fix your feet and level your femoral heads. If we can accomplish that, your life will be immeasurably better.\" This dialogue virtually guarantees the patient will accept your recommendations and elect to buy at least one pair of orthotics. Balancing the feet Once we've gone through the A-P L-S, we can then either go to the lateral L-S or the cervical spine X-rays, depending on where their injury is. We can compare their X-ray with normal, and if they have symptoms and if their X-ray doesn't demonstrate normal biomechanics, we can teach them \"Maggs' Law\": When the loading of a tissue exceeds the capacity of that tissue, compensatory physiological changes occur . (FIG. 2) (FIG. 3) We can explain to the patient that what we see on the exam, X-rays and digital foot scan is objective \u2014 it's black and white. Humans are architectural structures influenced by gravity, aging and stresses. 30 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS SEPTEMBER 3, 2019 CHIROECO.COMThis can easily cause muscle constriction with inflammation, nerve root compression with inflammation, joint capsule inflammation, tendonitis, bursitis, etc. In the end, abnormal loading produces compensatory changes and an acceleration of degeneration over a patient's lifetime. We can explain that once we balance the feet and level the femoral heads, we then want to work on healing the involved area. I recommend cold laser (Fig. 5), as this can be used for virtually every and any condition, from fractures to abrasions and contusions, to strains and sprains, pre-surgery and post-surgery, and most conditions that patients suffer. We can explain to patients that laser provides accelerated healing and reduces pain and inflammation faster than any therapy. *Must be a new registrant to receive. Available while supplies last.

Patient response to recommendations Over the years I've learned that blurting out recommendations I think are appropriate for a patient is a waste of time. We don't know all the circumstances that make up a patient's life, like their schedule, their goals, their financial situation, etc., so we can go through a series of questions with a patient to better match an appropriate set of recommendations to a patient's life. We can explain to the patient that what we see on the exam, X-rays and digital foot scan is objective \u2014 it's black and white. What they elect to do about it is subjective, and we want the patient to have a say in it as well. We first talk about the reason they have come in, which usually is some condition or injury that is affecting their life, and what it will take to improve that component of their case. You can explain that it's impossible to know how many visits or how long this aspect of care will take, but the less activity, work and exercise they do during this initial phase, the quicker their injury will heal. Everyone wants to continue a full exercise program while also wanting to heal at record pace. It can't happen. In this case you can let them choose what they'd like to do, and then give them honest outcome potentials: \" If your goal is to get better as quickly as possible and spend the least amount of money, you'll want to take 2-4 weeks off from exercise .\" We can then explain we don't know how long treatment will take, as everyone heals at a different rate, so let's set up a fixed number of visits, and we'll do our best to get improvement with those visits. We'll re-evaluate at the end and set up our next phase at that time. If they are still suffering symptoms, we re-do the original plan. Once they get better, we then talk about the rest of their life. \"Do you want to be the average American who only reacts to your symptoms, or do you want to be more proactive?\" Patient 81 years young At the conclusion, I then tell them the story of my patient who has been coming to see me three times a week for 37 years. He's 81, still works as an engineer full-time, runs three days per week, and goes to the gym three days per week. I kiddingly say I don't know if there's any correlation, but there might be, so maybe the patient should think about that. We both smile, and the patient has some good food for thought.

From treating skeletal muscle and connective tissue to improving or regulating structural or functional damage, one technique is on point with healing. Enter dry needling, an alternative- medicine technique used to treat muscle pain, myofascial dysfunction or myofascial pain syndrome (MPS). This therapeutic technique uses solid filiform needles or hollow-core hypodermic needles to precisely pinpoint and treat \"trigger points\" \u2014 the points causing pain or issues \u2014 in the body. As the treatment is not yet mainstream, there are a lot of misconceptions about it. Here are 14 facts about dry needling: Dry needling is not acupuncture While both acupuncture and dry needling involve a filament needle used to prick specific spots in the body, they differ in how they actually treat the body. Acupuncture is used to treat internal issues such as digestive problems, stress and allergies. Alternatively, dry needling is used to treat muscular pain and myofascial dysfunction or MPS. Acupuncture can be used to treat chronic pain and inflammation as dry needling does, but that is not the focus of the treatment. Targeted dry needling is better than PT In a 2010 technological innovation and literature review on dry needling, it was reported that the level of effectiveness of dry needling is up to 93% after an average of 10 sessions. Physical therapy has not seen the light of those results in that number of sessions. A 2014 study even determined dry needling is the most effective method for frozen shoulder, an issue often treated with physical therapy, but with lower-quality results.CLINICAL CONCERNS DRY NEEDLING IS NOT ACUPUNCTURE And 13 other facts about the technique for muscle pain BY LEV KALIKA, DC TIME TO READ: 6-8 MIN. THE TAKEAWAY Often associated or confused with acupuncture, dry needing does not pinpoint internal issues like acupuncture, but targets muscle trigger points causing pain. As studies have shown, dry needling positively impacts other chiropractic issues, and with the introduction of ultrasound has become evidence-based. 36 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS SEPTEMBER 3, 2019 CHIROECO.COMDry needling is evidence-based Dry needling hit a progression after it became integrated with imaging tech - niques in 2012 studies. The specific imaging technique used is ultrasound. Dry needles are connected to ultrasound machines, allowing health providers to visually see exactly where the dry needle is placed. Therefore, there is no room for error with dry needling due to the ultrasound- guided technology. In fact, the duo now has a combined name, ultrasound-guided dry needling (UGDN). Dry needling is physiological Dry needling is physiological because it affects the way organisms and bodily parts function. By insertion into muscle trigger points, dry needles cause change to those areas \u2014 positive change, of course, being a treatment. Dry needling is not so painful When comparing pain levels of dry needling to intramuscular injection or regular physiotherapy, the pain is far less, even nonexistent to some, with dry needling. Even getting pricked on the finger is more painful than dry needling. Dry needling has a strong anatomical effect Just as surgery has the ability to do, dry needling effectively reduces myofascial pain, and ameliorates symptoms of neuropathy and local muscle hypo-motility in low-back pain. Dry needling is a safer alternative to surgery that can yield the same results. Patients should be open-minded to dry needling before resorting to surgery. Dry needling can alter posture Dry needling is not only a method for treating myofascial pain, but also restoring posture. Because dry needling improves muscle spasticity and restricted movement, it naturally corrects posture as well. Dry needling is a sophisticated approach It is mandatory to conduct a whole-body neuromuscular ultrasound with dry needling, making it a more sophisticated approach. Patients will holistically learn about their posture, muscle spasms and muscle pain. Dry needling expertise is required Health providers are only able to perform dry needling if they have exper - tise in muscle anatomy, pain medicine, neurology, ultrasound and muscle physiology. The entire physical and mental state of patients is taken into account when dry needling, and to perform the treatment effortlessly, health care providers must be experts at a plethora of health specialties. Dry needling has been revolutionized by ultrasound If trigger points are not targeted, dry needling is unsuccessful. Ultrasound- guided technology has eliminated any risk of failure in dry needling by providing clear images of the body and where the needle is being inserted. While some practitioners and doctors may have a special ability to locate trigger points without the aid of images, Because dry needling improves muscle spasticity and restricted movement, it naturally corrects posture as well. 2012The year dry needling became majorly integrated with imaging techniques in studiesCLINICAL CONCERNS UPCOMING COURSES FMT RockPods & FMT FMT RockPods certification introduces the concept of skin/fascial decompression to help improve tissue mobility, improve movement and modulate pain* with the use of myofascial cups.

CHIROECO.COM SEPTEMBER 3, 2019 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 37CLINICAL CONCERNS ultrasound-guided dry needling is undoubtedly the better choice to make, as there is no room for mistakes. Check dry-needling certifications There are untrained people performing dry needling throughout the world. Imprecise needling can lead to pneumo - thorax (lung puncture), nerve damage, vascular damage and visceral (abdom - inal organ) damage. To better determine if your practitioner or doctor is an expert at dry needling \u2014 ask yourself these questions: \u0084\u0084Is this practitioner certified in dry needling? \u0084\u0084Who is this practitioner certified by?\u0084\u0084Is there evidence of this practitioner's continuing education in dry needling? Dry needling can treat tendons Dry needling for tendons can be done with acupuncture needles, but for the majority of tendons, a hypodermic needle is preferred. The hypodermic dry needle requires local anesthesia because it would be too painful other - wise. Dry needling for tendons is different from dry needling for myofas - cial pain because it induces local tissue damage to create reparatory reaction from the tissues. It is just as effective as PRP (plasma injections). Dry needling for tendons also requires ultrasound guid - ance because the needle is too large to be used without precise guidance. Dry needling may treat athletic injuries While more evidence is needed, it is possible that dry needling can help treat acute and chronic injuries in elite sports. Athletes could have less pain and improved muscle function with the aid of dry needling. Dry needling works better as monotherapy Monotherapy involves one type of treat - ment. It is better to try dry needling without supplementary interventions because there would be no interference to the nervous system in its response to the treatment. While dry needling has not yet entered the mainstream, its study results are inviting further inquiry into this method of treating muscle pain, myofascial dysfunction or myofascial pain syndrome.

Is this inadequate stiffness at adjacent joints?\" Warming up the engine I get responses like, \"I stretch and warm up.\" Far too many weekend warriors \"warm up\" almost exclusively by standing still and elongating muscles . My response is, \"Let's schedule the next session so I can teach you some proper exercise sequencing.\" This includes soft-tissue therapy (foam roll, application of cold topicals or CBD), positional breathing, mobility/stability training (includes ground-based standing and moving maneuvers), some ELDOA stretching, and movement/sprint/power progressions. The new understanding is you are \"warm\" when you are neurologically responsive and coordinated, your reflexes are sensitive and some adrenalin is pumping. Topicals and patient body awareness The soft-tissue lesson starts with rubbing on a topical to enhance body awareness of recurring areas of pain or soreness. I explain, \"This topical containing CBD may help you, as a weekend warrior, suffer less.\" Patients and chiropractors are both interested in CBD and having retail CBD sales in the office. The current legal market for in-office sales is with hemp-derived products only. Joel Carden from Nexzol Pharma explained, \"Patients are looking to their chiropractors for a recommendation on CBD products they can trust and [have] proven results.\" Top-level topical companies should use pharmaceutical-grade ingredients, perform quality testing, and have a product that has the ability to penetrate the deeper layers of the skin.

For a topical, the key is looking for skin pene - tration and retention at the site applied. In an oral tincture I look for products in various strengths, concentrations (with or without THC), and flavor. Carden says, \"Regarding weekend warriors, the message is getting out that sports medical needs and favoring a healthy lifestyle can be improved with CBD topicals.\" The science and the pipeline that companies are developing will enable producers to deliver meaningful doses (e.g. better bioavailability) of cannabinoids, unlike some current products marketed today.\" Stuart Tomc from CV Sciences suggests, \"using products that have a shelf life...will enable them to remain fresh and stable and have clinical data to support efficacy and safety claims in order to be used to manage health concerns.\" Help patients 'biohack' their health As a biohack practitioner [editor's note: 'hacking' your biology with lifestyle and food/supplement additions], I'm used to using supplement products that are doseable and have high bio-availability. We have to be able to trust that the seeds, growth process (pesticide use or not, etc.), harvesting knowledge, CBD extraction process, and the end product is stable with CBD-rich hemp. Our cost and resale value has to add up too; and again, patients want products designed to alleviate pain. I observe hardcore tri-athletes, runners, gym goers, structured-class-training students, people in programs from all ages, and the all-familiar \"weekend warrior\" improve by using safe CBD and other topical products.

That's because RPM isolates, extracts, and then activates the pro resolving compounds in krill. These lipid mediators, the resolvins, protectins, and maresins are members of the overlooked family of chemicals that can work toward the body's natural resolution of inflammation. RPM goes beyond a proprietary blend of pro-resolving nutrients. These nutrients need to be activated. Their powers need to be unleashed, so RPM includes white willow bark. White willow bark is one of the oldest known medicinal herbs, and because it's rich in tannins that protect the stomach, it works in ways even aspirin can't. The way that white willow enhances the eectiveness of other natural ingredients in RPM makes it even more valuable. It unlocks natural cellular power.

Getting new patients, managing day-to-day flow, patient retention and training staff monopolize precious time and energy. Practice-life balance falls to the bottom of the priority totem pole. The weight of running a practice starts right out of the gate and, odds are, it will get heavier as a practice grows. With more patients come more profits, yes, but also more responsibilities. Pressure mounts. Lunches turn to catching up on paperwork. Late nights happen on a regular basis. THE TAKEAWAY Building a practice based on an end goal is what will help you build a practice that's authentic. This goal should be something that is true to who you are and reflects the type of doctor you want to be for your community. 48 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS SEPTEMBER 3, 2019 CHIROECO.COMReaching a breaking point There's a hidden epidemic affecting almost half of chiropractors, and it needs to be called out. Approximately 40% of DCs report experiencing moderate to high emotional exhaustion. The toll of running a practice is weighing heavy on far too many. The irony is that, as chiropractors, the grounding principle for everything we do comes down to one word \u2014 alignment. In the clinical sense, we focus on helping patients align with their bodies to express better health. No matter our technique, practice model or philosophy, everything we do for our patients is focused on being centered, connected and vibrant. But when it comes to alignment in our own lives, it falls to the wayside. Health gets put on the back burner. Long hours in practice interfere with family time. Vacation dreams turn into ever-growing bucket lists. Re-aligning life We need alignment to \"live into how we serve.\" Not just from a spinal standpoint, but holistically, so we can be a model to our patients for how to thrive in health and in life. Most DCs take the approach that one must build a profitable practice first, then focus on building an amazing life. But this approach is backwards. It puts chiropractors out of alignment and actually makes the journey to success that much harder. If all hands are on the practice deck, priorities fall out of balance. Eventually stress will fester, planting seeds for less energy, lack of focus, and resentment, which is why it's critical to address practice-life imbalance. To build (and maintain) practice-life balance, start with reflecting on these three questions: What are you doing it all for? It's easy to get lost in the daily grind of practice, forgetting what motivated you in the first place to be your own boss. Most DCs have an entrepreneurial spirit that propels you to be in charge of your own time, how you care for patients and how you make your money. Underneath that calling lies something deeper...something that motivates you to be a doctor every day. Who are you building a future for?

What dreams can your success cultivate? What does your practice give you the ability to do when you're not working? This is about reconnecting with the big vision you have in mind. If you remember what drives you to wake up each morning, then you'll be motivated by a bigger vision, one that lies outside of your practice and even yourself. So when the practice stresses show up (and they will), you'll be more resilient because you are connected to your deeper \"why.\" This is the foundation for building a practice-life balance and remembering why it's important. What does your practice look like when it's booked? Most DCs don't have a clear vision of what their practice looks like when it's filled with patients. They are operating their practice and making decisions based on present circumstances. For the burned-out chiropractor, that can mean staring at empty schedules and waiting for insurance checks to come in, so building a practice feels desperate and reactionary. DCs end up scrambling to get new patients in any way they can and often compromise on the type of practice they actually want. Office hours expand and marketing budgets burst at the seams. When the end is not in mind, It's the perfect recipe for practice burnout. There is no room for balance with this picture. So the switch? It's about looking at your practice with a new lens. Picture your practice this way: \u0084\u0084What hours do you want to work? \u0084\u0084How much money do you want to generate every week, month and year in practice? \u0084\u0084How many patients do you want to see? This is about building your practice based on what you \"want\" versus what you \"have\" to do. The \"have to\" approach only leads to rash decisions and sleepless nights, all to forget the type of practice you actually want.

Building a practice based on an end goal is what will help you build a practice that's authentic \u2014 something that is true to who you are and reflects the type of doctor you want to be for your community. When you use this perspective, you instantly create balance because your practice reflects your truth. You and your practice are one and the same. What life moments can you experience along the way? This last question is pivotal, because it gives you the leverage to make micro-changes in your daily and weekly life, so you improve the quality of it. Balance doesn't mean you instantly have to figure out how to go on a trip around the world or buy your dream home. Rather, it's about creating subtle moments that make you feel like you're living in the here and now. Sometimes the simplest changes can create the most profound shifts, making you recognize what you've been missing out on yet how simple it is to integrate into your life. Ask yourself: \u0084\u0084What's a hobby or activity you used to do that you keep putting off? \u0084\u0084What's your favorite thing to do with a loved one that you aren't making the time for? \u0084\u0084If you opened up 15 minutes a day or one hour a week to do something you love, what would that be? Now schedule it in your calendar. Create a standing appointment with yourself that is 100% focused on life and fill it with that one thing. Then watch the shift that happens. Creating this one shift will elevate your happiness, which will translate into more focus and intention in your practice, all in just creating a few moments of time for yourself. Practice-life balance doesn't have to be a pipe dream or something that gets put on the back burner. It can be crafted starting day one by having clarity on what your ideal practice and life looks like to you, so you can be in alignment with it.

Relief isn't always in the form of pain relief medication, and while some of these natural remedies may take longer to offer results, you could be saying goodbye to joint pain for forever. Check out these five ways to help get relief from your pain.1Joint pain relief supplements A lot of times, our pain relief can be caused by the lack of vitamins or supplements in our body. We need cartilage for proper bone support, but cartilage often decreases as we age. This may be a fact of life, but there are ways you can slow the loss of cartilage or help your body make more. Some of this can be done by taking supplements that naturally increase the amount of carti - lage production in your body. One of these supplements is glucosamine. This is found naturally in our bodies, but many of us are deficient without knowing. We need glucosamine to form cartilage and synovial fluid, which is important for joint pain. Many of these supplements come from the shells of sea creatures. Another supplement to take is chondroitin. This helps produce new cartilage in the body and protects the existing cartilage you already have. When you are dealing with joint pain, this can help because it brings more water into the joint spaces, helping to cushion your joints. Chondroitin can also be derived from sea animals, but it is often obtained from cows and pigs as well. The other supplement to consider taking is salicin. Salicin comes from a tree, but it's a specific willow tree that's native to only Europe and Asia. Many people take this to help reduce inflammation in their joints and help with joint pain. 2Weight loss Joint pain, especially arthritis-re - lated pain, can be caused by extra weight. Those who are overweight may deal with more severe joint pain. This is SALICINDerived from a tree native to only Europe and Asia, this natural medicine helps reduce inflammation in joints 56 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS SEPTEMBER 3, 2019 CHIROECO.COMArthritis is a large cause of joint pain, and many find they can't get relief from the pain, no matter what they do. In fact, it's the leading cause of disability amongst adults. especially tough because it's hard to work out and lose weight with joint pain. Losing weight can do a lot for your health, but it can also reduce the amount of stress that your joints feel, which will greatly reduce the pain. 3Fight inflammation An important natural way to fight joint pain is to get rid of the inflam - mation in your body. Arthritis and other stress can cause joint pain, but if you fight inflammation, you'll be in a lot less pain. Inflammation can be reduced by over-the- counter medications, but the better way to do this is to change your diet. Certain foods cause inflammation all throughout your body, like dairy and grains. A diet low in dairy consumption could help your pain, and wheat or gluten can wreak havoc on the digestive system and lead to greater inflammation. To fight inflammation in your body, stick to a diet that is rich in protein, fruits and vegetables. 4Pain-relief creams If you're sick of taking an over-the-counter pain medication, you can look toward pain-relief creams, which can Are you able to look at your whole /f_inancial life and /f_igure out where you may need an 'adjustment'?

There are plenty of pain-relief creams to choose from, and some of them use all-natural ingredients for safe and effective relief.5 Exercise While it may seem counterintu - itive to exercise when you have joint pain, it may be the best thing for your body. Your joints are swollen and regular exercise can help to stop this from happening. When you regularly exercise, you will maintain the flexi - bility in your joints that keeps them feeling good. As we age, that flexibility decreases, but exercise can help you get it back. When you have joint pain, you'll want to choose exercises that are low-impact. Running isn't going to be a good choice, and even walking can hurt many who deal with severe joint pain. Instead, try something like swimming or water aerobics. Water helps you feel weightless, and while you will get a great workout, it won't feel heavy and overwhelming on your joints. Chiropractors and arthritis If you're suffering from arthritis joint pain, chiropractic work can provide great relief. If you are a chiropractor yourself suffering joint pain, pain relief options can be exhausting to deal with. Remember, the best way to treat joint pain is with natural remedies that help prevent it from developing in the first place.

This one compound eases pain, reduces systemic inflammation, stops free radical damage, alleviates depression, and protects cellular processes throughout the body. No doubt that treatment in the past with curcumin has been challenging. Curcuminoids can be difficult for the body to absorb. Outside of a daily regimen of dietary curcumin from an early age, it can be especially tough for any patient who may have consumed a standard American diet over their lifetime to get therapeutic benefits from plain turmeric extracts or even standardized 95% curcumin extracts. Greater bioavailability That is why some important research has focused on a clini - cally-studied curcumin (BCM-95/Curcugreen) that is blended with turmeric essential oil (also a source of ar-turmerone). This crucial difference helps it absorb more efficiently and remain in the bloodstream at meaningful levels for a longer period than standard extracts, making it a viable option for many conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, two conditions that probably appear frequently in DC practices. One study using this curcumin blended with turmeric CURCUMIN, DEPRESSION AND CANCER For body and mind vitality, curcumin is proving a wonder supplement BY AJAY GOEL, PHD, AGAF TIME TO READ: 5-7 MIN. THE TAKEAWAY A long-available compound, curcumin has come of age, now with greater absorption, making it a viable option for many conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. 60 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS SEPTEMBER 3, 2019 CHIROECO.COMessential oil followed 45 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, randomized to three groups: \u0084\u0084Group one received diclofenac sodium, 50 mg, twice daily; \u0084\u0084Group two received 500 mg of the curcumin twice daily; \u0084\u0084Group three received both diclofenac sodium and the curcumin. Curcumin was more effective than diclofenac sodium at reducing joint pain and swelling. Combining it with the drug was no more effective than using the botanical alone, and taking the drug alone was less effective. Pain, dosage and depression Another study compared this same curcumin to diclofenac for osteoarthritis, and found similar results: Curcumin was comparatively effective and didn't cause the gastrointestinal side effects of the prescription drug. In this case, the dosage of the curcumin was 500 mg, taken three times daily. But in each study, the amount of curcumin is a convenient level for patient compliance. Patients in physical pain can be more prone to depression, and curcumin can address that as well. A clinical study published in the journal Phytotherapy Research focused on individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). It compared the efficacy and safety of high-absorption curcumin blended with turmeric essential oil, the prescription anti-depressive fluoxetine, and a combination of both. The curcumin dosage was a total of 1,000 mg daily, and fluoxetine was 20 mg \u2014 whether combined or individually. The best response, measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), was in the combination group, at 77.8%. Interestingly, the single-therapy groups scored almost exactly the same, with fluoxetine at 64.7% and curcumin at 62.5%. Two important conclusions from this study: Curcumin worked as well as the prescription drug fluoxetine in terms of the measurable changes in the HAMD-17 score from baseline to six weeks of treatment; and curcumin may be used as an effective and safe treatment for patients with MDD, with no psychological side effects. Brain health and cancer Additional studies have found that curcumin promotes the generation of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), a key protein for brain plasticity and overall mental well-being.

Some of the ways that curcumin does this are by reawakening the sleeping genes in our bodies that naturally inhibit cancer cells, increasing the activity of cancer drugs, and decreasing drug resistance in cancer cells to help drugs kill tumors more efficiently. Additionally, curcumin protects normal cells from the toxic effects of chemotherapy drugs and radiation treatments. In fact, a clinical trial showed that curcumin decreased the severity of adverse effects of radiation therapy on the urinary tract in men with prostate cancer. Curcumin and other botanicals Aside from working well with conventional drugs, curcumin is an excellent partner to other botanicals. I have been fortunate to be on a team of researchers who investigated the workings of curcumin in combination with tannin-free, oligomeric proanthocyanidins from a fractionated grape seed extract (VX1). Results showed that the two botanicals working together were more powerful in fighting tumor growth than either of the ingredients were on their own \u2014 each appeared to bolster the other. Curcumin has astounding potential. We know that well- being is holistic \u2014 inflammation, oxidative damage and chronic mental stress are interrelated in ways we are still always trying to understand. For promoting mind and body vitality, curcumin has much to recommend it: It is well-tolerated; it works through virtually every pathway; it supports (and sometimes outperforms) conventional medications; and \u2014 provided it is blended with turmeric essential oil for safe and effective absorption \u2014 it is easily incorporated into your patients' regimens.
