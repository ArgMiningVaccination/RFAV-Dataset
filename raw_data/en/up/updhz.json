This is the fifth set of warning letters the FTC has announced as part of its ongoing efforts to protect consumers from health-related COVID-19 scams. In all, the Commission has sent [similar letters to more than 120 companies and individuals](https://www.ftc.gov/coronavirus/enforcement/warning-letters). Several of the letters announced today target \"treatments,\" including Chinese herbal medications, music therapy, ozone therapy, and shields claimed to boost the immune system by protecting the wearer from electromagnetic fields. However, currently there is no scientific evidence that these, or any, products or services can treat or cure COVID-19. The FTC sent the letters announced today to the companies and individuals listed below. The recipients are grouped based on the type of therapy, product, or service they pitched as preventing or treating COVID-19. Supplements and Chinese Herbal Treatments: [AcuIntegra, Inc.](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_acuintegra_inc.pdf)(Clarksville, Tennessee) [American Chinese Oregon) Acupuncture](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_swro_beatty_acupuncture.pdf)(Tulsa, Oklahoma) Body Acupuncture](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_mind_body_acupuncture.pdf)(Los Angeles, California) [Mulberry Leaf Acupuncture and Herbs](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_mulberry_leaf_acupuncture_and_herbs.pdf)(Studio City, California) [Nature's Best Relief, Inc.](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_swro_natures_best_relief.pdf)(Littleton, Colorado) [Naturopathic European Medical Centre LLC](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_naturopathic_european_medical_centre_llc.pdf)(Stevens Point, Wisconsin) [Nicole only) Alaska) Food [The Acupuncture: [Acupuncture Healing Center](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_acupuncture_healing_center.pdf)(Chicago, Illinois) [Art of Healing](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_art_of_wellness_acupuncture_traditional_chinese_medicine.pdf)(Los California) Treatments: Therapies/Hydrotherapy: [Dr. Brownstein's Holistic Medicine/The Center for 02 Good](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_dap_feelin_o2_good.pdf)(Riverhead, New York) [Holgistic Personalized Care Institute](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_dap_holgistic_personalized_healthcare.pdf)(Royal Michigan) [iCRYO](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_dap_icryo.pdf)(Houston, Texas) [LotusRain Clinic](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_swro_lotusrain.pdf)(San Diego, California) [Vital Source Natural Washington) Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy and Scalar Frequencies: [iMRS2000 and Bryant Meyers](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_imrs2000.com_.pdf)(Bradenton, Florida) [Spooky2Scalar](/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_dap_spooky_2_scalar.pdf)(Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China) In the letters, the FTC states that one or more of the efficacy claims made by the marketers are unsubstantiated because they are not supported by scientific evidence, and therefore violate the FTC Act. The letters advise the recipients to immediately stop making all claims that their products can treat or cure COVID-19, and to notify the Commission within 48 hours about the specific actions they have taken to address the agency's concerns. The letters also note that if the false claims do not cease, the Commission may seek a federal court injunction and an order requiring money to be refunded to consumers. Last month, the FTC announced its [first case against a marketer of such products](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/04/thrive-supplement-marketer-agrees-preliminary-order-barring-him), Marc Ching, doing business as Whole Leaf Organics. The FTC [previously sent warning letters](https://www.ftc.gov/coronavirus/warning-letters) to sellers of vitamins, herbs, colloidal silver, teas, essential oils, and other products pitched as scientifically proven COVID-19 treatments or preventatives. The FTC also recently announced letters targeting general therapy products, supplements, and herbal treatments. The letters sent today went to the marketers of more esoteric products and services, including nebulizers, naturopathic and homeopathic treatments, hydrotherapy, and freeze-dried horse milk.
