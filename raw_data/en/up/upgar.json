LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST SB 1236, Price. Professions and vocations. (1) Existing law, until January 1, 2013, declares that using a vertical enforcement and prosecution model for the Medical Board of California's investigations is in the best interests of the people of California. Under existing law, a vertical enforcement and prosecution model is described as the joint assignment of a complaint to a board investigator and to a deputy attorney general responsible for prosecuting the case if the investigation results in the filing of an accusation. Existing law requires the board to, among other things, establish and implement a plan to locate specified staff in the same offices in order to carry out the intent of the vertical enforcement and prosecution model. This bill would extend the operation of these provisions to January 1, 2014, and would also make a conforming change in that regard.

(4) Existing law specifies reports to be made and procedures to be followed when a coroner receives information, as specified, that a death may be the result of a physician and surgeon's, or podiatrist's gross negligence or incompetence, and in connection with disciplinary actions against those licensees. This bill would expand those provisions to include conduct of a physician assistant. (5) Existing law requires a physician and surgeon, osteopathic physician and surgeon, and a doctor of podiatric medicine to report to his or her licensing board the occurrence of an indictment or information charging a felony against the licensee or the conviction of the licensee of a felony or misdemeanor. Under existing law the failure of those licensees to submit the required report is a crime. This bill would impose that requirement on a physician assistant. Because a violation of this requirement by a physician assistant would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. (6) Existing law, the Physical Therapy Practice Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of physical therapists by the Physical Therapy Board of California. Existing law authorizes the board to appoint an executive officer. Existing law makes these provisions inoperative on July 1, 2013, and repealed on January 1, 2014.

Under existing law, within 3 years of initial approval by the board, each program approved by the board is required to receive full institutional approval by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education, which is responsible for, among other things, providing approval to operate private postsecondary institutions according to specified minimum operating standards. This bill would provide the board with ongoing authority to establish those standards. The bill would also update references to provisions providing for the approval by the bureau to operate private postsecondary institutions. (11) Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of court reporters by the Court Reporters Board of California within the Department of Consumer Affairs. Existing law authorizes this board to appoint an executive officer and committees as necessary. Existing law repeals these provisions on January 1, 2013. This bill would extend the operation of these provisions until January 1, 2017, and would specify that the board is subject to review by the appropriate policy committees of the Legislature. Existing law requires, until January 1, 2013, certain fees and revenues collected by the board to be deposited into the Transcript Reimbursement Fund to be available to provide reimbursement for the cost of providing shorthand reporting services to low-income litigants in civil cases. Existing law authorizes, until January 1, 2013, low-income persons appearing prose to apply for funds from Meetings\\AGENDA -CHAPTERED Page 4 of 60 Transcript Reimbursement Fund, subject to specified requirements and limitations. Existing law requires the board, until January 1, 2013, to publicize the availability of the fund to prospective applicants. Existing law requires the unencumbered funds remaining in the Transcript Reimbursement Fund as of January 1, 2013, to be transferred to the Court Reporters' Fund. This bill would extend the operation of these provisions until January 1, 2017, and would make a technical change to these provisions. By extending the operation of the Transcript Reimbursement Fund, which is a continuously appropriated fund, the bill would make an appropriation. (12) Existing law, the Electronic and Appliance Repair Dealer Registration Law, provides for the registration and regulation of electronic and appliance service dealers and service contractors by the Bureau of Electronic and Appliance Repair, Home Furnishings, and Thermal Insulation within the Department of Consumer Affairs and makes a failure to comply with its provisions a crime. Existing law, until January 1, 2013, requires a service contractor to pay specified fees to the bureau, including a registration fee and a registration renewal fee. Existing law, until January 1, 2013, requires the Director of Consumer Affairs to gather evidence of violations of the Electronic and Appliance Repair Dealer Registration Law, and any of its regulations, by a service contractor or by any employee, partner, officer, or member of any service contractor. Existing law, until January 1, 2013, requires a service contractor to maintain specified records to be open for inspection by the director and other law enforcement officials. Existing law, until January 1, 2013, also provides for the revocation of the registration of a service contractor by the director and for the superior court to issue a restraining order or injunction against a service contractor who violates these provisions. This bill would extend the operation of these and other related provisions to January 1, 2015. By extending the operation of certain of these provisions, the violation of which is a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. (13) Existing law, until January 1, 2013, establishes the Health Quality Enforcement Section within the Department of Justice for the purpose of investigating and prosecuting proceedings against licensees and applicants within the jurisdiction of the Medical Board of California, the California Board of Podiatric Medicine, the Board of Psychology, or any committee under the jurisdiction of the Medical Board of California. Existing law, until January 1, 2013, requires all complaints against licensees of these boards to be made available to the Health Quality Enforcement Section. This bill would extend the operation of these provisions until January 1, 2014.

Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason. Appropriation: yes.

The licensee may, but is not required to, submit any additional exculpatory or explanatory statement or other information that the board shall include in the central file. Each board may permit any law enforcement or regulatory agency when required for an investigation of unlawful activity or for licensing, certification, or regulatory purposes to inspect and have copies made of that licensee's file, unless the disclosure is otherwise prohibited by law. These disclosures shall effect no change in the confidential status of these records. SEC. 2. Section 801.01 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read: 801.01. The Legislature finds and declares that the filing of reports with the applicable state agencies required under this section is essential for the protection of the public. It is the intent of the Legislature that the reporting requirements set forth in this section be interpreted broadly in order to expand reporting obligations.

If the claimant or his or her counsel has not received this notice within 45 days after the settlement was reduced to writing and signed by all of the parties or the arbitration award was served on the parties or the date of entry of the civil judgment, the claimant or the claimant's counsel shall make the report to the appropriate board. (f) Failure to substantially comply with this section is a public offense punishable by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars ($500) and not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000).

If confidentiality is required by court order and, as a result, the reporter is unable to provide the records and depositions, documentation to that effect shall accompany the original report. The applicable board may, upon prior notification of the parties to the action, petition the appropriate court for modification of any protective order to permit disclosure to the board. A professional liability insurer, self-insured governmental agency, or licensee or his or her counsel shall maintain the records and depositions referred to in this paragraph for at least one year from the date of filing of the report required by this section. (h) If the board, within 60 days of its receipt of a report filed under this section, notifies a person named in the report, that person shall maintain for the period of three years from the date of filing of the report any records he or she has as to the matter in question and shall make those records available upon request to the board to which the report was sent. (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no insurer shall enter into a settlement without the written consent of the insured, except that this prohibition shall not void any settlement entered into without that written consent. The requirement of written consent shall only be waived by both the insured and the insurer. (j) (1) A state or local governmental agency that self-insures licensees shall, prior to sending a report pursuant to this section, do all of the following with respect to each licensee who will be identified in the report: (A) Before deciding that a licensee will be identified, provide written notice to the licensee that the agency intends to submit a report in which the licensee may be identified, based on his or her role in the care or professional services provided to the patient that were at issue in the claim or action.

(C) At least 10 days prior to the expiration of the 30-day reporting requirement under subdivision (d), provide the licensee with the opportunity to present arguments to the body that will make the final decision or to that body's designee. The body shall review the care or professional services provided to the patient with respect to those services at issue in the claim or action and determine the licensee or licensees to be identified in the report and the amount of the settlement to be apportioned to the licensee. (2) Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to modify either the content of a report required under this section or the timeframe for filing that report. (k) For purposes of this section, \"licensee\" means a licensee of the Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, the California Board of Podiatric Medicine, or the Physician Assistant Board.

(b) Failure to make a report required by this section shall be a public offense punishable by a fine not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000). SEC. 4. Section 802.5 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read: 802.5. (a) When a coroner receives information that is based on findings that were reached by, or documented and approved by a board-certified or board-eligible pathologist indicating that a death may be the result of a physician and surgeon's, podiatrist's, or physician assistant's gross negligence or incompetence, a report shall be filed with the Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, the California Board of Podiatric Medicine, or the Physician Assistant Board. The initial report shall include the name of the decedent, date and place of death, attending physicians or podiatrists, and all other relevant information available.

No board-certified or board-eligible pathologist, nor any authorized agent, shall be liable for damages in any civil action as a result of his or her providing information under subdivision (a). SEC. 5. Section 803 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read: 803. (a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), within 10 days mhtml:file://G:\\ACUPUN\\Board Meetings\\AGENDA -CHAPTERED Page 10 of 60 after a judgment by a court of this state that a person who holds a license, certificate, or other similar authority from the Board of Behavioral Sciences or from an agency mentioned in subdivision (a) of Section 800 (except a person licensed pursuant to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 1200)) has committed a crime, or is liable for any death or personal injury resulting in a judgment for an amount in excess of thirty thousand dollars ($30,000) caused by his or her negligence, error or omission in practice, or his or her rendering unauthorized professional services, the clerk of the court that rendered the judgment shall report that fact to the agency that issued the license, certificate, or other similar authority.

SEC. 6. Section 803.1 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read: 803.1. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, the California Board of Podiatric Medicine, and the Physician Assistant Board shall disclose to an inquiring member of the public information regarding any enforcement actions taken against a licensee, including a former licensee, by the board or by another state or jurisdiction, including all of the following: (1) Temporary restraining orders issued.

(2) (A) All settlements in the possession, custody, or control of the board shall be disclosed for a licensee in the low-risk category if there are three or more settlements for that licensee within the last 10 years, except for settlements by a licensee regardless of the amount paid where (i) the settlement is made as a part of the settlement of a class claim, (ii) the licensee paid in settlement of the class claim the same amount as the other licensees in the same class or similarly situated licensees in the same class, and (iii) the settlement was paid in the context of a case where the complaint that alleged class liability on behalf of the licensee also alleged a products liability class action cause of action. All settlements in the possession, custody, or control of the board shall be disclosed for a licensee in the high-risk category if there are four or more mhtml:file://G:\\ACUPUN\\Board Meetings\\AGENDA -CHAPTERED Page 11 of 60 settlements for that licensee within the last 10 years except for settlements by a licensee regardless of the amount paid where (i) the settlement is made as a part of the settlement of a class claim, (ii) the licensee paid in settlement of the class claim the same amount as the other licensees in the same class or similarly situated licensees in the same class, and (iii) the settlement was paid in the context of a case where the complaint that alleged class liability on behalf of the licensee also alleged a products liability class action cause of action. Classification of a licensee in either a \"high-risk category\" or a \"low-risk category\" depends upon the specialty or subspecialty practiced by the licensee and the designation assigned to that specialty or subspecialty by the Medical Board of California, as described in subdivision (f). For the purposes of this paragraph, \"settlement\" means a settlement of an action described in paragraph (1) entered into by the licensee on or after January 1, 2003, in an amount of thirty thousand dollars ($30,000) or more. (B) The board shall not disclose the actual dollar amount of a settlement but shall put the number and amount of the settlement in context by doing the following: (i) Comparing the settlement amount to the experience of other licensees within the same specialty or subspecialty, indicating if it is below average, average, or above average for the most recent 10-year period. (ii) Reporting the number of years the licensee has been in practice. (iii) Reporting the total number of licensees in that specialty or subspecialty, the number of those who have entered into a settlement agreement, and the percentage that number represents of the total number of licensees in the specialty or subspecialty. (3) Current American Board of Medical Specialties certification or board equivalent as certified by the Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, or the California Board of Podiatric Medicine. (4) Approved postgraduate training. (5) Status of the license of a licensee. By January 1, 2004, the Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, and the California Board of Podiatric Medicine shall adopt regulations defining the status of a licensee. The board shall employ this definition when disclosing the status of a licensee pursuant to Section 2027. (6) Any summaries of hospital disciplinary actions that result in the termination or revocation of a licensee's staff privileges for medical disciplinary cause or reason, unless a court finds, in a final judgment, that the peer review resulting in the disciplinary action was conducted in bad faith and the licensee notifies the board of that finding. In addition, any exculpatory or explanatory statements submitted by the licentiate electronically pursuant to subdivision (f) of that section shall be disclosed. For purposes of this paragraph, \"peer review\" has the same meaning as defined in Section 805. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, the California Board of Podiatric Medicine, and the Physician Assistant Board shall disclose to an inquiring member of the public information received regarding felony convictions of a physician and surgeon or doctor of podiatric medicine. (d) The Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, the California Board of Podiatric Medicine, and the Physician Assistant Board may formulate appropriate -CHAPTERED Page 12 of 60 explanatory statements to be included with any information released, and may by regulation establish categories of information that need not be disclosed to an inquiring member of the public because that information is unreliable or not sufficiently related to the licensee' s professional practice. The Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, the California Board of Podiatric Medicine, and the Physician Assistant Board shall include the following statement when disclosing information concerning a settlement: \"Some studies have shown that there is no significant correlation between malpractice history and a doctor's competence. At the same time, the State of California believes that consumers should have access to malpractice information. In these profiles, the State of California has given you information about both the malpractice settlement history for the doctor's specialty and the doctor's history of settlement payments only if in the last 10 years, the doctor, if in a low-risk specialty, has three or more settlements or the doctor, if in a high-risk specialty, has four or more settlements. The State of California has excluded some class action lawsuits because those cases are commonly related to systems issues such as product liability, rather than questions of individual professional competence and because they are brought on a class basis where the economic incentive for settlement is great. The State of California has placed payment amounts into three statistical categories: below average, average, and above average compared to others in the doctor's specialty. To make the best health care decisions, you should view this information in perspective. You could miss an opportunity for high-quality care by selecting a doctor based solely on malpractice history. When considering malpractice data, please keep in mind: Malpractice histories tend to vary by specialty. Some specialties are more likely than others to be the subject of litigation. This report compares doctors only to the members of their specialty, not to all doctors, in order to make an individual doctor's history more meaningful. This report reflects data only for settlements made on or after January 1, 2003. Moreover, it includes information concerning those settlements for a 10-year period only. Therefore, you should know that a doctor may have made settlements in the 10 years immediately preceding January 1, 2003, that are not included in this report. After January 1, 2013, for doctors practicing less than 10 years, the data covers their total years of practice. You should take into account the effective date of settlement disclosure as well as how long the doctor has been in practice when considering malpractice averages. The incident causing the malpractice claim may have happened years before a payment is finally made. Sometimes, it takes a long time for a malpractice lawsuit to settle. Some doctors work primarily with high-risk patients. These doctors may have malpractice settlement histories that are higher than average because they specialize in cases or patients who are at very high risk for problems. Settlement of a claim may occur for a variety of reasons that do not necessarily reflect negatively on the professional competence or conduct of the doctor. A payment in settlement of a medical malpractice action or claim should not be construed as creating a presumption that medical malpractice has occurred. You may wish to discuss information in this report and the general mhtml:file://G:\\ACUPUN\\Board Meetings\\AGENDA -CHAPTERED Page 13 of 60 issue of malpractice with your doctor.\" (e) The Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, the California Board of Podiatric Medicine, and the Physician Assistant Board shall, by regulation, develop standard terminology that accurately describes the different types of disciplinary filings and actions to take against a licensee as described in paragraphs (1) to (5), inclusive, of subdivision (a). I~ providing the public with information about a licensee via the Internet pursuant to Section 2027, the Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, the California Board of Podiatric Medicine, and the Physician Assistant Board shall not use the terms \"enforcement,\" \"discipline,\" or similar language implying a sanction unless the physician and surgeon has been the subject of one of the actions described in paragraphs (1) to (5), inclusive, of subdivision (a). (f) The Medical Board of California shall adopt regulations no later than July 1, 2003, designating each specialty and subspecialty practice area as either high risk or low risk. In promulgating these regulations, the board shall consult with commercial underwriters. of medical malpractice insurance companies, health care systems that self-insure physicians and surgeons, and representatives of the California medical specialty societies. The board shall utilize the carriers' statewide data to establish the two risk categories and the averages required by subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (b). Prior to issuing regulations, the board shall convene public meetings with the medical malpractice carriers, self-insurers, and specialty representatives. (g) The Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, the California Board of Podiatric Medicine, the Physician Assistant Board shall provide each licensee, including a former licensee under subdivision (a), with a copy of the text of any proposed public disclosure authorized by this section prior to release of the disclosure to the public. The licensee shall have 10 working days from the date the board provides the copy of the proposed public disclosure to propose corrections of factual inaccuracies. Nothing in this section shall prevent the board from disclosing information to the public prior to the expiration of the 10-day period. (h) Pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (b), the specialty or subspecialty information required by this section shall group physicians by specialty board recognized pursuant to paragraph (5) of subdivision (h) of Section 651 unless a different grouping would be more valid and the board, in its statement of reasons for its regulations, explains why the validity of the grouping would be more valid. SEC. 7. Section 803.5 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read: 803.5. (a) The district attorney, city attorney, or other prosecuting agency shall notify the Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, the California Board of Podiatric Medicine, the State Board of Chiropractic Examiners, the Physician Assistant Board, or other appropriate allied health board, and the clerk of the court in which the charges have been filed, of any filings against a licensee of that board charging a felony immediately upon obtaining information that the defendant is a licensee of the board. The notice shall identify the licensee and describe the crimes charged and the facts alleged. The prosecuting agency shall also notify the clerk of the court in which the action mhtml:file://G:\\ACUPUN\\Board Meetings\\AGENDA -CHAPTERED Page 14 of 60 is pending that the defendant is a licensee, and the clerk shall record prominently in the file that the defendant holds a license from one of the boards described above. (b) The clerk of the court in which a licensee of one of the boards is convicted of a crime shall, within 48 hours after the conviction, transmit a certified copy of the record of conviction to the applicable board. SEC. 8. Section 803.6 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read: 803.6. (a) The clerk of the court shall transmit any felony preliminary hearing transcript concerning a defendant licensee to the Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, the California Board of Podiatric Medicine, the Physician Assistant Board, or other appropriate allied health board, as applicable, where the total length of the transcript is under 800 pages and shall notify the appropriate board of any proceeding where the transcript exceeds that length. (b) In any case where a probation report on a licensee is prepared for a court pursuant to Section 1203 of the Penal Code, a copy of that report shall be transmitted by the probation officer to the board.

The method for accomplishing this goal shall be to train foreign medical graduates to become licensed as physician assistants at no cost to the participants in return for a commitment from the participants to serve full time in underserved areas for a four-year period. (b) By February 1, 1994, or one month after federal funds to implement this article become available, whichever occurs later, the office shall establish a training program advisory task force.

(c) In the case of default by a participant who has successfully completed the program and has obtained licensure under this article, the program shall collect the following damages from the participant: (1) The total cost expended by the program for the training of the applicant, and interest thereon from the date of default.

The new funding shall be sufficient to cover the full additional cost to the educational institution or institutions that establish the program or programs, the cost of tuition and attendance for the students in the program or programs, and any additional costs, including enforcement costs, that the office or the board incurs as a result of implementing this article.
