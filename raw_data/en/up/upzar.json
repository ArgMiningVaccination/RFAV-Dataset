What we don't know is whether it will occur in ve years or 50 years. Will it be the H5N1 avian infl uenza or some other fl u strain?\" In 1997, the rst huma n case of H5N1 bird fl u emerged in Hong Kong . The relent less spread of the pathogen has ravaged fl ocks of bird s across Asia, but so far the virus has not proven to transmit easily from poultry to people or from person to person. \"The H5N1 virus has spread in a wide geographic rang e among migratory birds in the Middle East and Africa,\" sa ys Dr. Cooper. \"The more birds and poul- try are expo sed and infected , the greater the chances of this virus exch anging genes with a human infl uenza virus and creating an emergent recombinant virus.\" Viruses often rapidly mutate into lethal strains by mix- ing genes, some times leaping in to anothe r species on the way. Both bird and human fl u viruses infect pigs, which can serve as a viral reservoir, breeding new and potentially fa- tal combinations. Mo st human avian fl u cases have resulted from direct contac t with live birds or raw poultry. Neurological pr oblems and lung damage kill up to half of those infected with the virulent H5N1 fl u strain. An ef- fective antiviral drug, Tamifl u, is in shor t supply. Outbreaks from China to Turkey have spurred calls for a crash program to develop a vaccine. \"Approval by the Food and Drug Administration normally takes four to ve years,\" says Dr. Cooper. \"Researc h is just beginning to move out of the lab and into early human trials. Few companies are willing to assume the medical and legal risks necessary to rush prom- ising but novel vaccines into immediate production, but I'm optimistic that a useful vaccine will be forthcoming.\" Get A Le g Up on RLS Do your legs st art tingling, twit ching or throbbing whenever you try to fall asleep ? At night, do you feel an uncontrollable urge to get up and walk around? If so, you may be among the estimated 12 million Americans\u2014nearly 10 percent of adults\u2014who suffer from a common neurologic al condition called restless legs syndrome (RLS). While no one kn ows the exac t mechanism of the disorder, re- searchers believe that it involves the neurotransmi tter dopamine. Tantalizing links to anot her dopaminergic problem, attention- de cit hyperact ivity disorder (ADHD), are spurring research into th e way abnormal brain chemistry triggers restlessness at night an d hyperactivity during the day. Like ADHD, the syn- drome often runs in families. RLS affl icts more women than men, and usually appears in middle age or earlier in those with a strong family history. People with \"secon dary\" RLS may be temporarily affl icted during pregnancy, or as the result of kidney failure, diabetes or Parkinson's disease. Unlike other disorders of the central nervous system, RLS often can be easily treated with Requip, the r s t d r u g speci cally approved by the Food and Drug Admin- istration to trea t moderate to severe RLS. Research shows that iron de ciency or anemia may play a role. \"Patients often experience worsening of symptoms at night, causing sleep distur bances and insomnia ,\" says neurologist Mohamed N. Hassan, M.D., a movement disorder specialist. \"One study found that 70 percent of people with RLS took up to three hour s to fall asleep every night. The underlying condition seems to be linked to hormonal fl uctuations in the body's sleep- wake cycle.\" 2PHYSICIAN PROFILE Every 45 seconds, someone has a stroke in the Unit ed States . About 85 percent of the time a clot lodges in an artery, blocking the fl ow of blood and starving the brain of oxygen. Another kind of stroke hap- pens when an artery within the skull suddenly ruptures, spilling blood into the brain. Only about 15 percent of victims of a bleeding, or hemorrhagic, stroke return to an independent lifestyle and more than a third die within a month. Hemorrhagic strokes occur when the constant poundi ng of high blood pressure weak ens and bursts the wall of a brain artery. Accumulation of amyloid protein in arterial walls in elderly individuals\u2014 a condition reported in Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon\u2014also can make vessels susceptible to bleeding. When a fl awed or leaky artery gives way, the brain swells and poolin g blood rapidly destroys adjacent brain tissue. \"Hypertension is the most common risk factor for a hemorrhagic stroke, as well as the easiest medi cal cause to trea t,\" says neurologist Is aac Silverman, M.D., co-medical director of The Stroke Center at Hartford Hospital. \"As a physician, it is frustrating to see patients who prefer no t to take their blood-pressure medicines go on to develop a life-ending or severely disabl ing brai n hemorrhage that could readily have been prevented. The thought\u2014 'I don't like to take my medicines'\u2014actually can kill \"An intracerebral mortality rate,\" adds Joao Gomes, M.D., who recently joined Hartford Hospital as a neurocritical physician, the only neurologist in the state with advanced tr aining in neurocritical care medicine. \"Immediate damaging effects of bleeding in the brain range from movement and speech problems to paralysis on one side and coma.\" Although there is currently no FDA-approved therapy for hemorrhagic stroke, victims who come to Hartford Hospital may be eligible for an ongoing clinical trial at The Stroke Center. The FAST (F actor Seven for Acute Stroke Therapy) trial for the treatment of acute intracerebral hemorrhage is ev aluating a clotting factor called Factor VII (NovoSeven\u00ae) that researchers hope wi ll reduce disability fr om bleeding in the brain and improve clinical outcomes. A synthetic form of a human protein that enhances blood clotting, Factor VII coagulates blood fl owing from the ruptured vessel and as a result, minimizes the early growth of a he- matoma\u2014the clotted blood collection\u2014within the injured brain. \"The larger the hematoma, the greater the impact on daily activities and survival,\" says Dr. Gomes. \"Patients are also at risk fo r serious complications for several weeks after a hemorrhagic stroke, including pneumonia or blood clots developing in weakened limbs.\" The drug must be started within four hours after onset of symptoms, so use of 9-1-1 emergency medical services is critical. Hartford Hospital is the only medical center in southern Ne w England to offer this potential therapy.Bleeding in the BrainJoao A.

Gomes, M.D., a Board- certi ed neurologist, recently joined The Stroke Center at Hartford Hospital. An assistant clinical professo r of ne urology at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, he special- izes in neurosci ences critical care and vascular neurology which includes the ca re of patients with br ain and spinal cord injuri es, stroke s, hemor- rhages, brain aneurysms and othe r neurovascular emergencies. A native of Venezuela, Dr. Gomes is the st ate's on ly fel- lowship-trained neurocritical care neurologist. \"We're a new breed,\" he says, explaining that th e sub- specialty blends expertise in neurology/neu- rosurgery and critical care medicine. He studied medicine at the Universidad Central de Venezuel a, trained in stroke and vascular neurology at Harvard Medica l School, and specialized in critical care of neurosurgical patients and victims of complex strokes and head trauma at the Johns Hopkins University. Marrie d and a father, Dr. Gomes li kes being on call to offer his help during the hyper- acute phas e when someone suffers a stroke, hemorrhage or severe brain injury. He often works wi th interventional ra- diologists to tr eat stroke s with clot-busting drugs and stents. For fun, he enjoys reading, particularly ct ion and history. 3WHAT'S GOING AROUND...N ews & BreakthroughsP I 0 N E E R I N G Hearts on the Mend Armed with the tool s of technology, Hartford Hospital cardi- ac surgeons are the rst in the region to harness the power of robotics to perform heart operations with speed, safety and smaller scars. Minimally invasive surgical techniques reduce pain, mini mize blood loss and shorten recovery times, but the complexi ty of cardiac su rgery\u2014and the infl exibility of the earlier versions of the instrumentation\u2014have previously limited cardia c surgery to the conventional, open method. Now surgeons at Hartford Hospital are using the da Vinci Robotic Surgical System for minimally invasive cardiac procedures. \"It was clear,\" says director of Surgery Orlando Kirton, M.D., \"that in addition to being able to perform cardiac proce- dures with high quality and good outcome, we needed to grow where the techno logy wa s going. That's wh at patients want. Da Vinci ts in well with that plan.\" The da Vinc i System from Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is the rst \"intuitive\" endoscopic robot. It offers surgeons and patients the best of both worlds: it has the bene ts of a minimally invasive procedure, but it gives surgeons the ability to see what they'r e working with as clearly as if they were performing open surgery. \"The robot offers su rgical suppor t to operate deep inside the body without making a large incision,\" says Jonathan Hammond, M.D., direct or of the Division of Cardiovascular Surgery. \"W e can get deep inside the chest without spreading the ribs , which minimizes pain.\" In addition, surgical procedures can be performed with movements that feel natural. \"The instruments are extremely fl exible an d can be introduced more deeply into the body cavity,\" says cardiac surgeon Robe rt Gallagher, M. D. \"They give you the same degrees of freedom as your own wrist. Standard endoscopic tools are just straight instruments. You can go in and out or up and down, but you can't get around corners. The robot is good fo r technically demanding procedures.\" Surgeons also apprec iate th e visualization and freedom the robotic system offers . Cardiac surgeon David Underhill, M.D., says, \"From a technical point of view, da Vinci offers spectacu- lar optics and vi sualization. The acuity is astounding. We see views inside the chest that we wouldn't see in conventional surgery.\" Motion scaling is an additional bene t of the system. \"Your relatively large movements can be translated into ner motion,\" says Dr . Gallagher. \"This is as close to real life as we've come. The view is three-dimensional, with images magni ed to the tenth power.\" Cardiac surgeons do acknowle dge some degree of frustra- tion at the loss of tactile sensation, especially when they rst began usin g da Vinci. \"Sometimes,\" says Dr. Underhill, \"I want to reach ou t and grab the tissue. But it becomes second-nature with use. Yo u can't feel the tissue or the suture material, or the needle going through, but the optics compensate. They show you how tight to pu ll on a stitch.\" Teams of cardiac su rgeons are wo rking on diff erent proce- dures. Drs. Underhill and Gallagher are using the da Vinci robot to dissect ou t the internal mammary artery (IMA) which is used as the bypass vessel for bypass procedures. The procedure can be done more cleanly with the robot. \"Thi s has gone exception- ally well,\" says Dr. Underhill. \"We're the only medical center in Connecticut that's doing this. We harvest the IMA with the robot, and then we perform the rest of the procedure conventionally.\" \"We're doing takedown of IMA now,\" says Dr. Gallagher. \"Next will be coronary bypass through small left-side incisions.\" Dr. Underhill adds, \"We're also and atrial septal defect closure.\" Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery with the Da Vinci Robotic System Whooping Worry Why is pertussis\u2014a prevent- able disease\u2014on the rise in the U.S.? Chances are the immunity you got fr om vac- cination in infancy has worn off. The American Academy of Pediatrics now recommends universal vaccination of adolescents. The telltale high- pitched \"whooping\" cough may be absent in previously immunized individuals, but they can pass life-threaten- ing infections to unvaccinat- ed infants and children.Pooped Out People who own dogs get more exercise than those who don't, reports The American Journal of Preven- tive Medicine . Owners of both large and small dogs in Vancouver, British Columbia, walk nearly tw ice as many minutes per week as their canine-free counterparts. Both male and female owners of all breeds engage in more physical activi ty than those who don' t own dogs.Smoking Alarm Moms who smoke during pregnancy put kids at risk of becoming overweight by the age of ei ght, warns a large U.S. study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology . Prenatal smoking has been shown to raise the ri sk of miscarriage, premature delivery and other pregnancy complications. Rapid \"catch-up\" growth in low-birth weight infants or nicotine withdrawal may help explain later obesity.Fatty Fries McDonald's recently admitted that it s large French fries contain a third more trans fats than previously known\u2014 a whopping eight grams of potentially artery-clogging trans fat and a total fat con- tent of 30 grams. Trans fat comes from adding hydrogen to vegetabl e oil in a process called hydrogenation. McDon- ald's provided the nutritional analysis in response to calls for healthier food. 4T H E N E W M E D I C I N E Currently Dr s. Underhill and Gallagher are the only two surgeons performing the takedown of the IMA for bypass pro- cedures. Dr. Ha mmond says , \"We decided it was best to have one or two individuals develop their skills on these procedures. We concentrate the effort on th em, and we don't have to worry about six diff erent learning curves. These two have gured out what work s well and what doesn't, and this is bene cial for patients in th e long run.\" Although da Vinci represents the very latest in minimally invasive technology, it 's already well esta blished at Hartford Hospital. Joseph Wagner, M.D., urologic surgeon, introduced the da Vinc i system to the hospital in 2003. Support from donors helped the hospital underwrite the cost of the million-dollar robot. The cardiac surg eons who've been usin g da Vinci feel as though they've had a solid foun dation upon which to build. \"Hartford Hospital has been a leader in this technology,\" says Dr. Underhill. \"There's a commitment to excellence in this on the part of the hospital. The infrastructure needed to perform such intricate procedures using the da Vinci robot is in place. The anesthesia team is excellent. For this type of surgery, you have separate lung ventilation, and the team has that down.\" Those in volved with the da Vinc i system at Hartford recognize that being the rst hospital in th e region to offer procedures using the ro bot carrie s with it the responsibility to proceed with great caution. \"We recognize the importance of proper training and proctoring as we advance along,\" says Dr. Gallagher. \"We perform our due diligence with respect to our patients.\" \"Cardiac surgery,\" says Dr. Gallagher, \"has been likened to fl ying a 747. Th e pilots go down a checklist every single time, even though they've fl own the plane hundreds of times. Everything is done in sequence to make it a safe fl ight. Take- offs and landings are the hardest. You need to have done everything exactly righ t, and then when yo u're ready to land, everything's been do ne to give you a safe landing. When you're sitting at the console, it's intuitive. Once you're at the robot, it all falls into place.\" Herb No Help The New England Journal of Medicine reports that a rigorous federally funded research study found that a plant extract, saw palmetto, doesn't relieve symptoms of prostate enlargement after all. Saw palmetto is the third- highest-selling herbal dietary supplement in the U.S., used by more than two million American men to treat be- nign prostate enlargement, a common condition unrelated to prostate cancer.Losing Control People at high risk for car- diovascular disease have the least contro l over cholesterol, Wake Forest University School of Medicine rese archers report in Circulation. Only 54 percent of study subjects took lipid- lowering drugs, and of those receiving treatm ent, only 41 percent achieved their target levels. African Americans and Hispan ic Americans were less likely to be treated and controlled than non-Hispanic whites.Fruitless Diet Low-fat diets al one don't re- duce the risk of heart attack or cancer in post-menopausal women, says a surprising new study in the Journal of the American Medical Associa- tion. Researcher s say simply reducing fat content isn't enough\u2014dieters also need to exercise, lose weight and eat more vegetables, fruits and grains. Adding fresh pro- duce may do more for health than lowering fat content.Cereal Prize As part of a healthy diet, forti ed grains may cut stroke risk by reducing levels of th e amino acid homocysteine. A North- western University study found that men who ate the most folate (folic acid) were 30 percent less likely to suffer a stroke. Tufts University re searchers say a cup of forti ed cereal daily adds B vitamins and decreases homocysteine blood levels. Drs. Gallaghe r (left) and Underhill are using the da Vinci Robotic System for minimally invasive cardiac surgery. 5 | in the DOCTOR'S OFFICE | \"Act in Time \" to Save Your Heart Heart disease is the number one killer of Americans of all ages. Each year more than a million people in the United States experience a heart attack, or myocardial infarction, and nearly half of them die. Most wait two or more hours after the onse t of symptoms before seeking medical help, often because they don't know they're having a heart attack. Nearly half of hear t attack deaths occur before the victim reaches the hospital. Most people don't realize that a \"wait and see\" attitude lessens their chances of survival. The classic heart attack suf- ferer is a middle-aged man who suddenly clutches his chest in excruciating pain, but of ten a pati ent's rst symptom\u2014 particularly in wome n\u2014is shortn ess of breath, light headness, jaw pain or even nausea. More than half of those who die sud- denly from a heart attack have no previous symptoms. If you suspect a heart attack may be occurring, call 9-1-1 immedi- ately to prev ent potentiall y fatal damage to the heart muscle. Many Americans don't realize that powerful life-saving therapies like clot-busting dr ugs and balloon angioplasty can stop a heart attack as it's happening. Rapid intervention is critical when a blood clot obstructs blood fl ow through a coro- nary artery , one of the main vessels that channel blood to the heart muscle. While artery-opening treatments can save lives and limi t heart damage, medications must be administered within an hour of symptom onset. \"The sooner we open a blocked artery, the better the outcome,\" says Raymond McKay, M.D., an interventional cardio logist at Hartford Hospital. \"Emergency catheterization, angioplasty and intrac oronary stenting can prevent heart dam- age and reduce the risk of having a second heart attack. Hartford Hospital re cently established a Chest Pain Center, where a team of emergency physicians and interventional cardio logists rapidly assesses patients to speed delivery of lifesaving catheter-b ased therapy. An electrocardiogram (EKG) administered in an ambulance or the hospital's LIFESTAR helicopter can be transmitted directly to the hospital to diag- nose a heart attack before the victim arrives in the Emergency Department (ED). Patients can receive drug therapy en route and go directly to the catheterization laboratory without delay. \"Hartford Hospital was one of the rst heart centers in Southern Ne w England to integrate local community hospitals into an organized network,\" sa ys Dr. McKay. \"Patients who come to th e hospital from longer distances away have the same mortalit y rates as those who come directly to the ED. At Hartford Hospital , 98 percent of heart attack victims treated in this manner survive.\" Do you know your blood pressure? The American Heart Association says 65 million Am ericans\u2014or nearly one in three adults\u2014have high blood pressure, de ned as a blood pressure equal to or greater than 140 mil- limeters of mercur y (mm Hg) over 90 mm Hg . What do those numbers mean, anyway? Simply put, the narrower your arteries, the more blood your heart pumps and the higher your blood pres- sure. A blood pressure reading consists of two numbers. The top number\u2014the systolic pressure\u2014is the amount of pressure your hear t generates when pumping bl ood out through your arter- ies. The bottom number\u2014the diastolic pressure\u2014is the amount of pressure in your arteries when your heart relaxes between beats. In short, blood pressure is a way of measuring how much force is being exerted on the walls of your arteries as blood fl ows through them. Blood pressure is normal if it's below 120/80 mm Hg, but 115/75 mm Hg is even better. Taking blood pressure medication as prescribed is critical to cardiova scular health. The American Journal of Medicine recently reported that Africa n Americans are 70 percent more likely to have inadequate blood pressure cont rol compared with whites, and mo re than 80 percent less likely to take their medicine regularly. Untreated hypertensi on is a \"silent killer\" that can damage th e heart and other organs and lead to life-threaten- ing hear t disease, stroke and kidney disease. Physicians urge everyone to know thei r numbers.What's In A Number? Act in Time to Heart Attack Signs is a public education campaign from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

Critical reaction times and braking distances often suffer in individuals with substantial cognitive decl ine, vision lo ss or physical impairments. In general, doctors do not want to be placed in the role of police. Determining when some- one with dementia ought to give up driving is dif cult for family members, as well as primary care physicians and geri atricians caring for an aging population. Someone with early Alzheimer's disease ma y continue driving long past the point of safety because real-world driving skills are dif cult to measure. Yet other patients are able to drive safely for some time. How can the family or physician accurately assess someone's ability to drive? The American Automobile Association (AAA) offers on-the-road driving evaluation and the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) administers written tests, but it's still hard to tell how someone might react if a child darted into the street. \"Paper-and-pencil assessment is two steps removed from actual driving, \" says Godfrey Pearlson, M.D., director of the Olin Neuropsychiatry Research Center at the Institute of Living (IOL). \"Testing a driver's reaction times while they're skidding in rain is ne ither poss ible no r ethical.\" Such a scenar io, however, can be easily simulated on a computer. Robert S. Astur, Ph.D., director of th e IOL's Virtual Reality Laboratory, has created a driving simulator that tests an individual's response to emergency situations in a controlled way. Developed with a Hartford Hospital grant funded by donor support, the simulator looks like an arcade video game with a steering wheel, brakes and a gas pe dal. Test subjects practice for 20 minutes or so to get a feel for the apparatus before beginning the 10-minut e test drive. Altogether it takes a couple of hours to drive and to complete various memory tests and problem-solving puzzles that assess a driver's cognitive function. The software lets ol der drivers test their skills on a safe, but realistic, on-screen obstacle course. Subjects must avoid simulated dangers like traf c in the lane ahead. Afterward, research- ers discuss the test results with subjects and follow up after six months to see if the individual is still driving. Alzheimer's disease affl icts an estimated 4.5 million people in the United States, but Connect- icut is not one of the states that require doctors to report drivers with dementia to the state DMV. Since the IO L testers have no legal authority to report poor performance or take away someone's license, results fr om the driving simulator are kept con dential, but can help individuals recog- nize for themselves when it's time to give up the wheel. Healthy normal individuals and those with memory complaints aged 65 and older are invited to test thei r driving on the simulator.

It takes up to 75,000 royal purple fl owers to make a single pound of the colorful and appetizing spice, a key ingredient in the Spanish dish paella. Now research- ers are reportin g the happy news that saffron may be a mood-enhancing, as well as potentia lly cancer-preventing, way to add healthy zest to your diet. Saffron seems to have originated in Greece or Asia Minor, now part of Turkey. Psychiatri sts in th e Middle East believe that saffron boosts mood as well as Prozac by enhanc ing the activi ty of neurotransmitt ers in the brain. In traditional Indian medi cine, saffron is used to treat bladder, kidney and liver disorders. The journal Cancer Detection and Prevention tested the compound's anti-tumor potential and found it to be a carotenoid-rich blend of antioxidants that may slow cancer growth. While saffron is expensive (as much as $1 2 per gram), don't try to save by buying the medicinal-tasting powdered version that is often diluted with cheaper spices. Spend the money on saffron threads\u2014or grow the delicate crocus plant in a sunny spot in your garden.Mussels with Saffron and Orange Ingredients 2 Tbsp. ol ive oil 2 large leeks, whites and \u00bd - 1 inch of green, cleaned thoroughly and sliced 1 medium carrot, cleaned and diced 2 large plum to matoes, seeded and chopped 2 large cloves garlic, chopped \u00bd cup dry white wine (substitute clam juice if orange peel\u00bc tsp. salt 2 lbs. fresh mussels, scrubbed and bearded (discard any that don't close during scrubbing) 2 Tbsp. chopped fresh cilantro In a large skil let with a tight tting lid, saut\u00e9 leeks and carrot in oi l over medium heat until crisp-tender, 3 - 4 minutes, stirring.
