Mental health is very important to overall health and well-being. Some of the services we administer are: - Bio-Medical evaluation and consultation - Medication evaluation (using both traditional and natural forms of medications) - Neuropsychological and psychological testing - Neurotransmitter testing - Testing for ADHD, memory and cognitive functions All psychological testing begins with a thorough evaluation of test results obtained on the various physical and neurophysical systems under our care. We also include advice on current medications, diet, life factors and environment as needed, and offer psychotherapy as indicated. All of the above treatment modalities pertain to children and youth with additional therapeutic processes pertaining to the family in general. Mental health and developmental challenges that children experience deeply affect their families; Integrative Medical Institute holistically includes children with their families in all therapies. The Integrated Medical Institute offers a range of traditional and non-traditional services to aid those suffering from addiction. Addictive behaviors are often complex and take a heavy toll on relationships and ability to function in life. Interested in Our Mental Health Service? If you need mental health help, don't wait. "}
