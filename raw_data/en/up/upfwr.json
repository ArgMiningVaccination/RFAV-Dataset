Harkness\u2014 was established in 1918 with the broad charge to enhance the common good. The mission of The Commonwealth Fund is to promote a high-performing health care system that achieves better access, improved quality, and greater efficiency, particularly for society's most vulnerable, including low-income people, the uninsured, minority Americans, young children, and elderly adults. The Fund carries out this mandate by supporting independent research on health care issues and making grants to improve health care practice and policy. An international program in health policy is designed to stimulate innovative policies and practices in the United States and other industrialized countries.The COMMONWEAL TH FUND Rising to the Challenge The Commonwealth Fund Scorecard on Local Health System Performance, 2016 Edition David C. Radley, Douglas McCarthy, and Susan L. Hayes July 2016 ABSTRACT The 2016 edition of The Commonwealth Fund's Scorecard on Local Health System Performance finds continuing wide variation in health and health care across U.S. communities. In its assessment of 36 indicators of access, quality, avoidable hospital use, costs, and outcomes, we see that health care improved more than it worsened between 2011 and 2014 in nearly all 306 local areas. Gains in access to care, quality, and efficiency often corresponded to implementation of public policies, such as the Affordable Care Act, and to quality improvement collaborations. But lack of progress on many indicators suggests further efforts are needed. Notably, mortality rates were mostly unchanged, and obesity rates rose in 111 of 306 localities. Health system performance is often linked to resource availability, with areas that have a high proportion of low-income residents tending to rank lower. Exceptions to this suggest, however, that local improvement efforts can succeed despite socioeconomic challenges. Support for this research was provided by The Commonwealth Fund.

This 2016 edition of The Commonwealth Fund's Scorecard on Local Health System Performance assesses the state of health care in more than 300 U.S. communities from 2011 through 2014, a period when the Affordable Care Act was being implemented across the country. In comparing health care access, quality, avoidable hospital use, costs of care, and health outcomes, the Scorecard shows that many U.S. communities experienced improvements: fewer uninsured residents, better quality of care in doctors' offices and hospitals, more efficient use of hospitals, and fewer deaths from treatable cancers, among other gains. Still, the persistence of widespread differences between areas is a reminder that many local health systems have yet to reach the potential attained elsewhere in the country. Using the most recent data available, the Scorecard ranks 306 regional health care markets known as \"hospital referral regions\" on four main dimensions of performance encompassing 36 measures. Top-ranked regions in Hawaii, the Upper Midwest, New England, and the San Francisco Bay area have been performance leaders over time, and they offer achievable improvement benchmarks for policymakers, health system leaders, and community stakeholders (Exhibit 1).

Exhibit 1 Overall Local Health System Performance: Scorecard Ranking, 2016 www.commonwealthfund.org 7 WHAT IS A HOSPITAL REFERRAL REGION? Hospital referral regions (HRRs) represent regional health care markets across the United States. There are 306 unique HRRs with at least one hospi - tal in which complex surger - ies are performed. Names of HRRs reflect the location (city or town) where the referral hospital is physically located. Because the regions are meant to represent travel and pro - vider referral patterns, they do not align to political boundar - ies and sometimes even cross state borders. HRRs, developed by the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care,* are widely used in health services research and policy analysis.** * Appendix on the Geography of Health Care in the United States, Abstracted

Commonwealth Fund Scorecard on Local Health System Performance, 2016 EditionIn this report, we examine changes in local performance on the 33 indicators we were able to track over time. * The good news: in nearly all U.S. communities, performance in recent years improved more often than it worsened, showing that progress is possible with supportive policies and local action. Still, in many places there was little or no meaningful change on many of our indicators of health and health care. As a consequence, only 14 U.S. localities improved on a majority of the Scorecard 's indicators (17 or more). Continuing geographic variability in health and health care may well reflect differences in state policies whose effects \"trickle down\" to local areas. Differences across communities also may stem from socioeconomic factors and the availability of local resources as well as local norms and practices. (Learn more about how regio nal collaboration and other factors can influence local health system performance.) These findings, as well as a recently reported uptick in U.S. mortality in 2015, suggest that to ensure a healthy and productive future for all Americans, the nation needs to make greater investments to address the social determinants of health , including economic opportunity, housing, nutrition, and environmental conditions, as well as to meet mental and behavioral health needs. 1 * For methodological reasons, trends for three performance indicators could not be calculated. A NOTE ON THE LOCAL SCORECARD SERIES This 2016 edition of The Commonwealth Fund's Scorecard on Local Health System Performance is the second in the series. The first was released in 2012. The 2016 Scorecard measures changes in local area performance over recent years for which data are available, generally 2011 through 2014 for most indicators. Although many indicators reported here overlap with those reported in the 2012 edition, changes in underlying data sources or measure definitions required that we rebase each performance indicator. Thus, this Scorecard should not be interpreted as a strict update of the 2012 edition. See Scorecard Methods and the Appendix for further detail, including a complete description of each performance indicator. Region- specific data are available online. MEASURING CHANGE The Scorecard evaluates change over time for 33 of the 36 indicators by identifying those instances of improvement or worsening that can be considered meaningful. We considered a change to be meaningful if it was at least 0.5 standard deviations larger than the indicators' observed rates between the two time points. Local areas with indicator rate changes less than 0.5 standard deviations are considered to have had exhibited little or no change. www.commonwealthfund.org 9More improvement than decline in recent years. In nearly all local areas (302 of 306), health care improved more than it worsened, according to the 2016 Scorecard . This means that in many places across the country, previously uninsured people gained health insurance\u2014in large part because of the Affordable Care Act's coverage expansions\u2014and more people reported they were able to get needed care. In addition, many people received higher-quality care, and fewer were readmitted to the hospital, than just a few years ago. More local areas improved than worsened on 27 of the 33 indicators that could be tracked over time and the majority of areas made meaningful gains on 10 of these (Exhibit 3). There were widespread reductions in uninsured rates and in the 30-day mortality rate following a hospital stay, as well as improvements in quality of care for nursing home residents. The share of home health patients whose mobility improved between 2012 and 2014 went up in more communities (255 of 306) than did any other measure.

Source: Commonwealth Fund Scorecard on Local Health System Performance, 2016 Edition.10 Rising to the Challenge: The Commonwealth Fund Scorecard on Local Health System Performance, 2016 Edition Akron, Ohio, and Stockton, Calif., stand out nationally for having each improved on more performance measures (19 of 33) than any other locality. An additional 12 regions improved on the majority of indicators (at least 17). (See box below to learn how Akron promotes better health through data and cross-sector collaboration.) Policy makes a difference. Because it spans the period following the ACA's passage through implementation of the law's major insurance coverage expansions, the 2016 Scorecard may be capturing some of the early effects of the reforms. These and other changes in federal policy, along with the actions of state and local governments, as well as private initiatives, appear to have influenced local health system performance in several areas of the United States. The ACA's major coverage expansions seem to have led to some of the most visible gains in performance. Between 2012 and 2014, the percentage of working-age adults (ages 18-64) without health insurance fell by four percentage points or more in 189 local areas. Several, including leader Jonesboro, Ark., saw double-digit declines in adult uninsured rates. In states that expanded Medicaid eligibility, communities that are disproportionately low-income realized much larger rate reductions than similar communities in states that did not expand Medicaid (Exhibit 4). Another example of policy making a difference is Medicare's Hospital Readmission Reduction Program, created by the ACA. In October 2012, Medicare began financially penalizing hospitals with high rates of rehospitalization. Although readmission rates had been declining slowly in the years preceding the new policy, the pace of decline accelerated between 2013 and 2014 nationally (as documented by our 2015 State Scorecard ). About half of local areas (155 of 306) saw meaningful reductions in 30-day readmissions (of at least 5.3 per 1,000 beneficiaries) between 2012 and 2014. The local areas making the most progress averaged a nearly 30 percent reduction. Also noteworthy are national quality reporting initiatives, such as Medicare's Hospital Compare, Nursing Home Compare, and related websites, that shine a spotlight on treatment provided in hospital, postacute, and The Akron area of northeastern Ohio offers the perfect sandbox in which to experiment with ways to improve health, according to Donna Skoda, Summit County Health Commissioner. \"It's big enough to have enough resources, and it's small enough to really make a difference,\" she says. An area of nearly 700,000, it is one of two U.S. hospital referral regions that improved on the most indicators in The Commonwealth Fund's 2016 Scorecard on Local Health System Performance . A few highlights: The Akron region has dramatically expanded access to health care. Summit County's uninsured rate is just 0.9 percent, following Ohio's Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the opening of the state's insurance marketplace. The insurance coverage expansion has likely helped more residents receive recommended care and may have helped reduce unnecessary hospital use and other drivers of health costs. Coaches from the Akron/Canton Area Agency on Aging are embedded at several local hospitals, possibly aiding in the region's drop in readmission rates. Through the ACA's Community-Based Care Transitions Program and other efforts, coaches assess patients' needs for chronic care management, home-delivered meals, transportation, and other types of support after discharge and then ensure they make safe transitions to their homes or other care settings. Health systems have also joined with a local medical school and university, a foundation, and the county public health department to launch an \"accountable care community\" focused on reducing chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and hypertension. Seeking long-lasting health gains, leaders are building more sidewalks and bike lanes, improving access to nearby parks, and bringing healthy food choices to urban neighborhoods. The Akron region's progress has been aided by its longstanding culture of collaboration, enshrined in its Quality of Life Project . Starting in 2003, all county departments and their nonprofit partners must agree on a set of shared goals and data to measure progress related to education, employment, and health. They also must explain how funds are being used to further these goals. \"Your health systems, health department, nonprofits, and government all have to work together to solve problems,\" Skoda says. \"There's enough work to go around: we just need to figure out how to coordinate our efforts.\" Akron, Ohio Collaborating for Collective Impact www.commonwealthfund.org 11long-term care settings\u2014all of which have seen clear gains in recent years. For instance, hospitals across the nation have made strides in providing evidence-based care for patients with heart attack, congestive heart failure, stroke, and pneumonia acquired outside the hospital\u2014conditions for which 30-day hospital mortality rates have declined in more than two-thirds of local areas. And a majority of localities meaningfully improved on a composite measure of hospital safety that assesses such things as hospital-acquired infections and adverse events related to surgery or other procedures. In general, ambulatory care quality did not improve to the same degree as did care provided in hospitals and other institutional settings. One exception was the reduction in many places in the percentage of elderly patients prescribed a \"high-risk\" medicine\u2014for example, one with possibly dangerous side effects for older individuals\u2014 between 2011 and 2013. These improvements may largely be attributed to a U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulatory action in 2010 that led to the withdrawal of several medications from the market, a demonstration of the importance of postmarket safety surveillance.2 -8-7-6-5-4-3-2-10Medicaid nonexpansion states Medicaid expansion states Higher-income local areas Lower-income local areasPercentage -point reduction in uninsured adults between 2012 and 2014 Notes: States' Medicaid expansion status as of January 1, 2014.

Exhibit 4 Larger Reductions in Uninsured Adults in Low -Income Communities in States That Expanded Medicaid 12 Rising to the Challenge: The Commonwealth Fund Scorecard on Local Health System Performance, 2016 EditionStark geographic differences are a reminder that where one lives matters. The health care experiences of people living in top-performing areas of the country can be dramatically different from those living in bottom-performing areas. On some indicators, the difference is as much as thirteenfold. Uninsured rates for working-age adults, for example, ranged from 4 percent in Massachusetts localities to nearly 50 percent in Harlingen and McAllen, Texas, in 2014. Despite the broad gains in health coverage, there are still many places in the country, particularly in Texas and the Southeast, where at least one of four working-age adults remains uninsured. Infant mortality varied more than threefold across regions in 2012-13, ranging from less than three deaths per 1,000 live births in San Mateo and Santa Barbara, Calif. (similar to rates experienced in Norway, which has among the lowest in the world) to more than 10 deaths per 1,000 live births in parts of Mississippi, South Carolina, and Georgia (rates that are on par with Serbia and China). Local efforts to reduce infant mortality have made a difference in places such as Stockton, Calif., and Grand Rapids, Mich .3 Performance varies widely within states. Striking differences among local areas within states point to additional opportunities for improvement. For example, premature deaths from treatable conditions varied more than twofold across Michigan, ranging from 64 deaths per 100,000 in Traverse City to 142 deaths per 100,000 in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn (Exhibit 5). 020406080100120140160 New Hampshire Connecticut Vermont Idaho Utah Massachusetts Nebraska Rhode Island Maine Minnesota Alaska Oregon New Mexico Hawaii Montana Wisconsin Arizona Colorado Washington Iowa Wyoming South Dakota North Dakota Distric of Columbia Kansas Delaware New Jersey Nevada California Pennsylvania Virginia North Carolina Ohio Illinois Maryland Florida Kentucky West Virginia Indiana New York Missouri Alabama Texas Oklahoma Georgia Tennessee Arkansas Michigan South Carolina Louisiana MississippiU.S. average, all races = 84 per 100,000 Notes: States are arranged in rank order based on the highest local mortality rate in the state .

Mortality amenable to health care : deaths per 100,000, 2012 -13 Exhibit 5 Premature Death Rates Vary by Local Areas Within States www.commonwealthfund.org 13In fact, on most Scorecard indicators, wide variation exists within many large states. In Texas, the share of adults who reported going without needed care because of the cost varied from 12 percent in Temple to 31 percent in McAllen. (See box below for how a health system in Temple, Texas, made efforts to improve patient access to care.) And in Florida, hospital admission rates for younger Medicare beneficiaries (ages 65-74) for potentially avoidable causes ranged from14 admissions per 1,000 in Sarasota to 46 per 1,000 in Lakeland. Costs vary for Medicare and private insurance enrollees, even within the same local area. The cost of health care varies widely between, and even within, local areas. Per-enrollee spending among Medicare beneficiaries in Miami, Fla., the highest-spending region, is more than double that in Honolulu, Hawaii, the lowest-spending region ($13,189 vs. $5,593). In the working-age population with employer-sponsored insurance, per-enrollee spending differences are even greater, ranging from $2,720 (Columbus, Ga.) to $9,362 (Wilkes-Barre, Pa.)\u2014three times as much. * Even within communities, there is little relationship, and big relative differences, between per-enrollee health care spending in employer-sponsored plans and Medicare (Exhibit 6). Most areas tend to have relatively high spending for one population and low spending for the other (see Appendix ). In fact, only 13 areas have relatively low spending per enrollee (in the lower 25th percentile) for both the Medicare and employer-sponsored, commercially insured populations. In 23 areas, meanwhile, spending is relatively high for both populations; these areas, mainly in Florida, Indiana, New Jersey, and Texas, are in the upper 75th percentile of spending. While higher spending is not always an indicator of inefficiency, particularly if it reflects a sicker population with complex health needs, it is not a reliable barometer of the quality of care delivered or better patient outcomes. * Per-enrollee spending estimates for Medicare and employer-sponsored coverage are adjusted for regional wage differences. Estimates exclude prescription drugs costs, and Medicare estimates exclude extra payments made for graduate medical education. While other health systems also have contributed to the health care gains seen in the Temple region of central Texas, Baylor Scott & White Health (BSWH) has undertaken a number of initiatives in recent years that may be helping to move the needle. The nonprofit health system, Texas's largest, runs three of the 10 hospitals in the Temple hospital referral region and provides care for an estimated two-thirds of the 503,000 people who live there. The Temple area improved on nearly half the indicators that could be tracked over time (16 of 33) in The Commonwealth Fund's 2016 Scorecard on Local Health System Performance . BSWH's focus on providing patient-centered care may have contributed to improvements in health care access for Temple area residents. In recent years, the health system has transformed its primary care clinics into patient-centered medical homes and introduced same-day appointments for primary and specialty care. The region has experienced a substantial reduction in the number of at-risk adults without a recent routine doctor's visit and increased shares of adults who have a usual source of care and receive age-appropriate vaccines. There also has been a decline in the rate of potentially avoidable emergency department visits by Medicare beneficiaries. Improvements in hospital safety may have been aided by BSWH's efforts to make performance on patient safety measures a bigger part of physician compensation. Strengthened nursing protocols may have helped as well: nurses now note on huddle boards which patients have complications, such as pressure ulcers, and they make more frequent rounds.But the Scorecard also revealed gaps in health system performance. Robert Probe, M.D., chief medical officer of BSWH, says three measures he might choose to focus on are adult obesity, avoidable emergency department visits (the region's rate is still high despite improvement), and Medicare beneficiaries' hospital admissions for conditions that can be treated in ambulatory care settings. \"While we [clinicians] strive to base clinical decisions on published guidelines, these calls are often influenced by local tradition. But being an outlier with an increased [hospital] admission rate makes me ask, 'Are our practices similar to what's being used around the rest of the country?'\" Robert Probe, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of BSWH, and Glen Couchman, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of BSWH-Central Texas division, generously shared information and insights for this profile. Temple, Texas A Focus on Patient-Centered Care and Patient Safety14 Rising to the Challenge: The Commonwealth Fund Scorecard on Local Health System Performance, 2016 EditionHealth system experience in the nation's largest cities. Large cities are the nation's economic and innovation hubs and home to many of the nations' most well-known hospitals and health systems. The largest U.S. metropolitan areas, comprising 53 local areas, account for 45 percent of the nation's total population, highlighting the importance of major cities in driving health system performance. Performance across these communities mirrors patterns seen nationally, with wide variation in urban residents' ability to access affordable care, in the quality of care received, and in health outcomes. (See the Appendix for a summary of health system performance in the local areas making up the nation's largest metropolitan areas.) Notes: Ratio values lower than 1.0 indicate lower -than -median spending, ratio values higher than 1.0 indicate higher -than -median spending. Median spending is determined separately for the commercially insured and Medicare populations. Spending estimates exclude prescription drug cos ts; are adjusted for regional wage differences; and Medicare estimates reflect only the age 65+ Medicare fee -for-service population.

Local areas with a disproportionate share of low-income residents tend to exhibit worse health system performance than areas with relatively fewer low-income residents. (For simplicity, we refer to these as lower-income and higher- income areas. *) As Exhibit 7 illustrates, lower-income areas tended to rank below higher-income ones on three of our performance dimensions\u2014access to care, quality of care, and health outcomes. However, in each dimension, there were several lower-income communities that outperformed wealthier ones. Compared with residents of higher-income areas, those living in lower-income areas are: more likely to report going without needed medical care because of the cost (19% vs. 12%) more likely to receive a high-risk prescription medication (20% vs. 13% among Medicare beneficiaries) more likely to die early in life from treatable conditions (106 vs. 68 deaths per 100,000 population) more likely to have lost six or more teeth because of decay or gum disease (15% vs. 8%). * Lower-income local areas are defined as those hospital referral regions (HRRs) where 40 percent or more of residents live in households with incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). Higher-income local areas are defined as those HRRs where fewer than 30 percent of residents live in households with incomes below 200 percent FPL.

Exhibit 7 Scorecard Performance Among Lower - and Higher -Income Local Areas: Low -Income Communities Tend to Rank Lower 16 Rising to the Challenge: The Commonwealth Fund Scorecard on Local Health System Performance, 2016 EditionSome communities with large low-income populations stand out for their high performance or for the progress they have made. For example, the Santa Barbara, Calif., region, where 41 percent of the population lives below twice the federal poverty level, ranked 38th overall, putting the community in the top quintile of performance in the Scorecard . Four other lower-income communities ranked in the top two quintiles of performance. And two of the four local areas with the greatest number of improved indicators (Stockton, Calif., and Cape Girardeau, Mo.) have large low-income populations. (See box below to learn about Stockton's efforts to improve local health.) Many economically disadvantaged regions were also among the most improved on certain indicators. (See box below to learn how local leaders in Pueblo, Colo., are collaborating to improve health system performance.) As noted previously, Jonesboro, Ark., where almost half the population has low incomes, had the largest decline in uninsured rates between 2012 and 2014. Three lower-income areas saw the largest reduction (9 percentage points) in the share of Medicare beneficiaries receiving high-risk prescription medications, exceeding the national rate of improvement. Medicare's payment penalties for high 30-day readmission rates seem to be having their intended effect of reducing rehospitalizations. The Scorecard finds that 30-day readmissions for Medicare beneficiaries fell in the majority of U.S. localities between 2012 and 2014. The reduction was greater in lower-income areas than in higher- income areas (7 vs. 5 fewer readmissions per 1,000 beneficiaries, respectively) (Exhibit 8). McAllen, Texas, which has the highest proportion of low-income residents, saw the largest reduction of all lower-income areas, with 17 fewer readmissions per 1,000 beneficiaries in 2014. The city of Stockton\u2014the seat of San Joaquin County in Northern California\u2014made headlines when its leaders filed for bankruptcy after the 2008 housing crash. A less-reported story is the 41 percent of area residents who live on incomes below twice the federal poverty level. Yet despite the health challenges created by chronic poverty, this region of nearly 600,000 made strides on all four dimensions of health system performance in The Commonwealth Fund's 2016 Scorecard on Local Health System Performance . Stockton's leaders collaborate to promote a \"health in all policies\" approach in which the public health department, providers, schools, and others work together to inject health into public life. For example: To expand access to care, a nonprofit organization runs health clinics in four local high schools that provide physical check-ups and behavioral health counseling. School nurses also administer flu vaccinations to children and parents, helping to reduce hospital use and enable rapid response to flu outbreaks. A nurse-led program offering education and support to pregnant African American women through the baby's first year of life led to a sharp drop in infant mortality for this group, from 14.3 deaths per 1,000 in 2013 to 10.7 per 1,000 in 2014. And three local hospitals have earned \"baby-friendly\" designations for their efforts to encourage breastfeeding among new moms. At one, San Joaquin General, breastfeeding rates rose from 5 percent in 2006 to 74 percent in 2016. Bolstered by California's Medicaid expansion, the public health department and managed care plans encourage people to enroll in coverage and find a medical home. And health plans have been promoting cancer screening, an area in which Stockton has performed particularly well. Research shows that communities can reap large returns on their investments in public health programs such as these. Stockton still faces challenges, including high rates of chronic conditions, says Tammy Evans, the county's public health director. But she sees momentum building for change. At a recent meeting to promote early access to dental care, it was standing-room only. \"Everybody recognizes the need in the community,\" she says, \"and everybody is saying 'Let me know what I can do\u2014I want to be a part of it.'\"Stockton, California Injecting Health into Public Life www.commonwealthfund.org 17Reduction in 30- day hospital readmissions, per 1,000 Medicare beneficiaries, 2012 -2014 Median reduction of 5 per 1,000 in local areas where less than 30% of the population lives in households with low incomes Median reduction of 7 per 1,000 in local areas where 40% or more of the population lives in households with low incomes Resident population below 200% FPL Note: : Lower -income local areas are defined as those hospital referral regions (HRRs) where 40% or more of residents live in households with incomes below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL).

Source: Commonwealth Fund Scorecard on Local Health System Performance, 2016 Edition. -20-15-10-505Exhibit 8 Low-Income Local Areas Are Making Progress in Reducing 30 -Day Readmissions to the Hospital After its local steel mill, and largest employer, downsized in the 1980s, the high-desert region of Pueblo, Colo., suffered a long economic decline that has left nearly half its residents living under twice the federal poverty level. Many have unhealthy lifestyles, as evidenced by smoking and obesity rates that are among the state's highest. In 2010, leaders of Pueblo's local hospitals and other provider organizations joined with the public health, social services, education, and business sectors to assess how they could address residents' health challenges and reinvest savings achieved from prevention efforts to revitalize the ethnically diverse community. They formed the Pueblo Triple Aim Corporation , named after the Institute for Healthcare Improvement 's model for improving population health and patient experiences while reducing the costs of care. Supported by community donations and philanthropic dollars, the nonprofit has been instrumental in reducing the teen pregnancy rate by 40 percent . The Commonwealth Fund's 2016 Scorecard on Local Health System Performance suggests these and related efforts are starting to pay dividends. From 2011 to 2014, the Pueblo hospital referral region (population 171,000) was among 14 that improved on more than half of the Scorecard 's 33 indicators that can be tracked over time. Improvements in access to care likely reflect the effects of Colorado's Medicaid expansion, local investment to expand the capacity of the Pueblo Community Health Center , and establishment of a medical residency clinic by a local hospital. To improve care coordination and follow-up care, the health center and a local behavioral health organization have stationed nurse care coordinators in local hospital emergency departments. This may have contributed to a reduction in avoidable hospital use. Local leaders consider performance measurement a key to educating stakeholders and motivating change efforts. \"It allows us to target our message to the community to show where we rank and what we are doing compared to other places in the state,\" says Matt Guy, executive director of the Pueblo Triple Aim Corporation. Pueblo, Colorado Better Health Through Data and Collaboration18 Rising to the Challenge: The Commonwealth Fund Scorecard on Local Health System Performance, 2016 EditionOpportunity for improved performance. As we noted earlier, the performance gains that the Scorecard identifies likely reflect the influence of public policy\u2014 most notably Affordable Care Act\u2014as well as the results of public and private initiatives implemented at the national, state, and community levels. The improved performance achieved in many communities, including those where many people have low incomes, suggest that local health systems can take steps to better serve all residents. By capitalizing on opportunities for improvement, communities can expand access to care, save lives, and improve care experiences for patients. (See the Commonwealth Fund's U.S. Health System Data Center for more information about the potential impact of change in each local area.) If all local health systems achieved the benchmarks set by top performers, nationally we might expect the following gains: 19 million additional adults and children would gain health insurance (on top of the 2014 gains in coverage achieved under the Affordable Care Act), thus helping to reduce cost barriers to needed care. 18 million fewer adults would forgo needed care because of the cost. 11 million additional adults would receive recommended cancer screenings, while 26 million more would receive recommended vaccines. Medicare beneficiaries would have 1.4 million fewer emergency room visits for nonemergency care or conditions treatable with primary care. There would be 100,000 fewer premature deaths before age 75 for conditions that can be detected early and treated with effective follow-up care. 11 million fewer adults (ages 18-64) would lose six or more teeth from decay, infection, or gum disease. The Scorecard's findings are also a reminder that where you live matters. While pockets of high performance exist and progress is more widespread in recent years, the sobering truth is that some people benefit more from their local health care delivery systems than others do. Many opportunities remain for improvement in many places across the country. For example, adult obesity rates rose in 111 of 306 areas between 2011-12 and 2013-14, which may portend a worsening in chronic conditions in future years. And rates of premature death from treatable medical conditions were mostly unchanged in the years measured by the Scorecard (between 2010-11 and 2012-13). Over the long term, federal and state policies may be required to address socioeconomic inequities and ensure that all communities have equal opportunities to improve. But as the Scorecard indicates, community and local delivery system leaders across the country are already demonstrating the power of innovation and collaboration to promote health. The examples highlighted in this report offer encouragement that\u2014even over a relatively short time\u2014health care professionals and local leaders can rise to the challenge of meeting their community's health needs. www.commonwealthfund.org 19SCORECARD METHODS The Commonwealth Fund's Scorecard on Local Health System Performance, 2016 Edition, evaluates 36 key indicators grouped into four dimensions: Access and Affordability (5 indicators) includes rates of health insurance coverage for children and adults, as well as people's cost-related barriers to receiving care. Prevention and Treatment (13 indicators) includes receipt of preventive care and quality of care in ambulatory, hospital, and long-term care and postacute care settings. Potentially Avoidable Hospital Use and Cost (9 indicators) includes hospital use that might have been reduced with timely and effective care and follow-up care, as well as estimates of per-person spending among Medicare beneficiaries and working-age individuals with employer-sponsored insurance. Healthy Lives (9 indicators) includes premature death rates and behaviors that put health at risk. The following principles guided the development of the Scorecard : Geography: The unit of analysis used in the Local Scorecard is the hospital referral region (HRR). HRRs are regional health care markets representing patients' travel patterns for the receipt of certain health care services. Every HRR is anchored by a city with at least one medical center that serves as the region's referral hospital for complex surgeries. HRRs are referred to as local areas, regions, or localities throughout the report. Performance metrics: The 36 metrics selected for this report represent multiple dimensions of health system performance. Where possible, the indicators align with those used in The Commonwealth Fund's previous state and local health system scorecards. However, several indicators included in the 2012 local scorecard were dropped for this edition, either because of data availability issues or concerns over the ongoing relevance of the measure. At the same time, several new measures were added, including substantially revised measures of adult preventive care. Measuring change over time: We were able to construct a time series for 33 of 36 indicators. Generally, there were two to four years between historic and current year data observation, though the starting and ending points, as well as total length of time, varied somewhat between indicators. We considered a change in an indicator's value between the historic- and current-year data points to be meaningful if it was at least 0.5 standard deviations larger than the indicator's observed values between the two time points\u2014a common approach in social science research.4 Data sources: Our performance indicators draw from publicly available data sources, including government-sponsored surveys, registries, publicly reported quality-of-care indicators, vital statistics, mortality data, and administrative databases. The most current data available were used in this report. The Appendix provides detail on the data sources and time frames. Scoring and ranking methods: We followed the scoring method used for the previous local scorecard. For each indicator, we calculated a ratio comparing the local area (HRR) rate to a benchmark\u2014the top 1 percent of HRRs. Where higher rates would indicate a move in a positive direction, we divided the local rate by the benchmark. Where lower rates would indicate a positive direction (e.g., mortality rates), we divided the benchmark by the local rate. The top ratio (best) was set to 100 percent for scoring purposes. Ratio scores for metrics within each of the four health system performance dimensions were averaged to calculate a dimension summary score for each local area. We then rank-ordered local areas based on their dimension summary score, and dimension ranks were averaged to derive an overall performance score. Local areas were grouped into quintiles of performance, both overall and on each dimension. 20 Rising to the Challenge: The Commonwealth Fund Scorecard on Local Health System Performance, 2016 EditionNOTES 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Vital Statistics Rapid Release, June 9, 2016, http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ products/vsrr/mortality-dashboard.htm ; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Policy Options to Impact Social Determinants of Health , http://www.cdc.gov/socialdeterminants/policy/index.htm . 2 See J.

Medicare estimates reflect only the age 65+ Medicare fee-for-service population. All-HRR medians were defined separately for ESI and Medicare spending. Data: Medicare, 2014 administrative claims via Feb. 2016 CMS Geographic Variation Public Use File. Employer-sponsored insurance spending, 2014 Truven MarketScan Database, analysis by M.Chernew, Harvard Medical School. Total per-enrollee spending estimates from a sophisticated regression model include reimbursed costs for health care services from all sources of payment including the health plan, enrollee, and any third-party payers incurred during 2014. Outpatient prescription drug charges are excluded. Enrollees with capitated plans and their associated claims are also excluded. Estimates for each HRR were adjusted for enrollees' age and sex, the interaction of age and sex, partial-year enrollment, and regional wage differences.26 Rising to the Challenge: The Commonwealth Fund Scorecard on Local Health System Performance, 2016 EditionAPPENDIX D.
