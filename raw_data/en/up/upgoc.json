What is VoIP? Voice over Internet Protocol (V oIP) is a form of communicati on that allows you to make phone calls over a broadband internet c onnection instead of t ypical analog telephone lines. Basic VoIP access usually allows you to call others who are also receiving calls over the internet. Interconnected VoIP services also allow you to make and receive calls to and from traditional landline numbers, usually for a service fee. So me VoIP services require a computer or a dedicated VoIP phone, while others allow you to use your landline phone to place VoIP calls through a special adapter. VoIP is becoming an attractive communications option for consumers. Given the trend towards lower fees for basic broadband service and the bris k adoption of even fast er internet offerings, VoIP usage should only gain popularity with time. However, as VoIP usage increases, so will the potential threats to the typical user. While VoIP vulnerabilities are typically similar to the ones users face on the internet, new threats, scam s, and attacks unique to IP telephony are now emerging. VoIP configurations Dedicated routers These devices allow you to use your traditional phone to place VoIP calls. They are connected to cable/DSL modems (or any high-speed internet source) and allow you to attach an ordinary telephone. Once configured, and with an appropriate VoIP provider and service plan, these devices require no special software or interaction with a computer . In fact, you only need to pick up your phone and dial a number at the dial tone. You also may bring your adapter with you when you travel and make calls wherever broadband internet access is available. Produced 2006; updated 2008, by US-CERT, a government organization. 1 Adapters (USB) These devices also allow you to use a traditional phone to place VoIP calls. They usually come in the form of USB adapters that are slightly larg er than the typical thumb drive. They feature a standard modular phone jack to which you can att ach an ordinary phone line. Once connected, your phone behaves as if it were connected to standard phone service. Behind the scenes, however, the included software is actually setting up a VoIP call. Software-controlled VoIP applications: \"softphones\" There are many software applications (\"softphones\") that allow you to place VoIP phone calls directly from an ordinary computer with a headset, microphone, and sound card. Internet telephony service providers usually give away their softphones but require that you use their service. Together, these applicatio ns and services enable users to talk to other people using the same service at no cost, and to th e rest of the world for a fee. So ftware-based VoIP applications are quite attractive to consumers because they often already have most of the components necessary to get started at little to no cost. Dedicated VoIP phones A VoIP phone looks like an ordi nary corded or cordle ss telephone, but it c onnects directly to a computer network rather than a traditional phone line. A dedicated VoIP phone may consist of a phone and base station that conne cts to the internet or it may also operate on a local wireless network. Like the VoIP adapters mentioned above, dedicated VoIP phones also require a provider and service plan. Requirements, Availability, and Service Limitations When considering VoIP service, you should not assume that its featur es, functionality, and options will equal those of trad itional landlines; you should be fa miliar with the requirements, availability, and possible service li mitations of VoIP service before switching to VoIP as either a primary means of communication or an e nhancement to your current services. Requirements VoIP requires a connection to the Internet through an ISP, a VoIP service to extend the reach to traditional landlines, and VoIP software to actually place calls. Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) requires none of these prerequisites. It is important to note that Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) internet service uses traditional phone line s for your internet connection; in this case, you already have telephone service to begin with. You may wish to we igh the expected benefits of VoIP against these costs given your current operating environment.

Traditiona l phone lines are usually still available during such an outage, which is a major advantage in an emergency. Ultimately, it may be necessary to use an uninterruptible pow er supply (UPS) with a VoIP installation if connectivity is desired during a power outage or some other kind of emergency. Availability due to bandwidth VoIP communication nearly always requires a high-speed (broa dband) internet connection for reliable functionality. Even given typical broadband connection speeds, though, service interruptions or degradation of quality is possible due to high internet traffic. For example, if you are trying to place a VoIP call while other peop le are using a lot of bandwidth on the same internet connection, the sound quality of your VoIP call or general VoIP availability may be affected. 911 services 911 services are not guaranteed wi th a basic (VoIP to VoIP) setup. However, it is available with many of the interconnected services that extend VoIP connectivity to tr aditional la ndlines. You should not assume that 911 services are presen t and working (even with interconnected VoIP services) but should consult with the terms of your service agreement. The FCC has described some of the challenges of VoIP services and has provided tips for VoIP subscribers. For more information, visit: http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/voip911.html . Threats / Risks Many of the threats associated with VoIP are si milar to the threats inherent to any internet application. Internet users are already familiar wi th the nuisance of email abuse in the form of spam and phishing attempts. VoIP opens yet another pathway for these annoyances, which can lead to spam over internet telephony (SPIT), spoofing, and identity theft. Additionally, the confidentiality of VoIP convers ations themselves has come into question, depending on service type or VoIP configuration. Spam over internet telephony (SPIT) As VoIP usage increases, so will the pesky marke ting strategies associated with it. Perennial annoyances like telemarketing and spam have be en plaguing consumers and internet users for years. A new sort of hybrid of these two concepts is SPIT, or spam over internet telephony. Like email spamming, sending commercial messages via Vo IP is fast and cheap. Unlike traditional telemarketing, though, VoIP offers the potential for large volumes of unsolicited calls, due to the wide array of tools already availa ble to attackers on the internet. Telemarketers could easily send Produced 2006; updated 2008, by US-CERT, a government organization. 3 large amounts of messages to VoIP customers. Unlike traditional spam email messages, which average only 10-20 kilobytes in fi le size, unwanted VoIP voicemails can require megabytes of storage. Spoofing It is technically possible for an attacker to masquerade as anothe r VoIP caller. For example, an attacker could possibly inject a bogus caller ID into an ordinary VoIP call so that the receiver believes the call to be coming from a known a nd trusted source (a bank, for example). The receiver, fooled by the electronic identification of the caller, ma y place unwarranted trust in the person at the other end. In such an exchange, the receiver may be tricked into disclosing personal information like account numbers, social security numbers, or s econdary authentication factor: a mother's maiden name, for example. This scheme is essentially the VoIP version of traditional phishing, where a user follows links in an unsolic ited email and is tricked into providing personal information on a bogus web site. Attackers may use these bits and pieces of personal information to complete partial identity record s of victims of identity theft. Confidentiality concerns Many critics of VoIP question its confidentiality. The concern is that VoIP data sometimes travels unencrypted over the internet. Therefore, it is technically possible for someone to collect VoIP data and attempt to reconstruct a conve rsation. Although it is extremely difficult to achieve, some software programs ar e designed to piece together bits and pieces of VoIP data in an effort to reconstruct conversations. While su ch activity is currently rare, you should be aware of this possibility as it may increase as VoIP becomes more widespread. How to Protect Against Risks Many of the principles and practi ces for safe VoIP usage are the same as those you may already be practicing with othe r internet applications. Ignoring th ese general principles could allow attackers to gain control of your computer operating system by means of an existing software flaw or a misconfiguration unrelated to your VoIP application. It may then be possible for them to exploit flaws in your VoIP configuration, thereby possibly gaining access to personal information you share when using VoIP. Here are some of the key practices of good personal computing: Use and maintain anti-virus and anti-spyware programs. Be cautious about opening files attached to email messages or instant messages. Verify the authenticity and security of downloaded files and new software. Configure your web browser(s) securely. Use a firewall. Identify, back-up, and secure your personal or financial data. Create and use strong passwords. Patch and update your application software.

If you are using a software VoIP application, consider using encryption software for both your installation and for t hose you wish to talk to. US-CERT has published a number of Cyber Security Tips that correspond to some of the items in the list above. To view a complete list of tips, visit: http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ . Encryption: proprietary vs. open Some VoIP applications use proprietary encrypt ion methods. Security professionals have voiced concern about these methods because they could contain backdoors for potential eavesdropping. In response to this uncertainty, encryption so lutions are being devel oped. For example, the creator of PGP designed an open-source software program that encrypts VoIP calls. VoIP encryption software is usually installed alongside the primary VoIP application and must be configured properly in order to function co rrectly. Additionally, both parties in a given conversation must have encrypt ion software installed for encryption to occur.
