While normal pharmaceuticals will eliminate symptoms right away, herbs heal at the source. Students in our [Holistic Health Practitioner Program](https://hhs.edu/programs/holistic-health-practitioner-program/) are trained to recognize the connection between the mind, body, and soul through an array of health tools outside of simply massage therapy. Our campuses in [Escondido](https://hhs.edu/escondido/), [Laguna Hills](https://hhs.edu/laguna-hills/), and [Kearny Mesa](https://hhs.edu/kearny-mesa/) all hold courses that teach our students how herbal medicine can benefit their future clients and themselves. One course that teaches our students about the connection between herbs and massage is Herbal Healing and Massage. This class teaches students how various herbs can benefit the physical and emotional body. Students learn specific healing effects of different herbs and how to incorporate them into a collection of therapeutic practices. These are a few herbal remedies used within massage therapy: Lavender Aside from the beautiful scent that lavender omits, this herb contains antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. As one of the most versatile herbs, it is most commonly known for its relaxing benefits; but lavender can also be used for cuts, bruises, and other skin irritants. Massage therapists use this lavender to promote relaxation and relief for their clients. Chamomile Chamomile is a soothing herb that can be used in a multitude of ways. Serving as much more than just a sleepy-time tea, it has also been used traditionally to help treat muscle and joint pains caused by inflammation, muscle spasms, menstrual disorders, ulcers, rheumatic pain, and hemorrhoids. This herb is great for clients experiencing high stress derived from physical pain. Cinnamon Cinnamon is known for its antiseptic, analgesic, and stress reducing properties. In addition, this herb has abilities to support heart health and boost energy levels. Within massage therapy, cinnamon leaf essential oils are used to improve the client's cognitive function, ease headaches, support heart health and maintain digestive health. Caraway Caraway is a great herb to heal many different symptoms a client may be suffering from. Massage therapists use this as an essential oil to relieve both emotional and physical complications. This herb is known to relieve symptoms of a cold, alleviate stress and anxiety, improve the appearance of skin, support heart health, improve digestion, ease muscle pain and support immune system function. At Healing Hands, we believe that holistic medicine is the most beneficial form of healing for your mind, body, and soul as a whole. Using herbal remedies within our massage therapy practices allows us to give our clients full restoration. In addition to covering herbal functions and their applications, students learn to create herbal massage products that they will take home, including herb-infused massage oils and salves.
