The post: [The online vegan community has been plagued by anti-vaxxers and conspiracists who denounce science. I've been vegan for 6 years and will always believe in the power of science & medicine!](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/khqijr/the_online_vegan_community_has_been_plagued_by/) [What about vegans who don't want to benefit from animal exploitation?](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/khqijr/_/ggnd1ta/) [Just as a quick note, there are many \"anti-vaxxers\" as you call them against many vaccines because of science, not because they are denouncing it. Every topic requires many hours and levels of research, as most of us have learned in becoming vegan. I am not against vaccines, in fact I wish I could comfortably take all of them, but I would have to ignore so many experiences and learned lessons to just run up and offer my arm. If we follow the money and it leads us to the most corrupt industries on earth, its ok to ask questions, just as we ask many to when exploring veganism. We live in a world now where everything is politicized and a label defines you and all of your principles....we should be moving past this and stop assuming we know everything.](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/khqijr/_/ggmzvrs/) [You don't even have the guts to post your face when shaming others with platitudes like \"power of science & medicine\" Wtf is this, Captain Planet](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/khqijr/_/ggni37c/) [I too am vegan and suuure as hell wont be taking the vaccine. I eat all these fruits and veggies and my body is in absolute tip top shape for this exact reason. Why the hell would I take a vaccine when my immune system is in incredible health](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/khqijr/_/ggnvpms/) [What A FYCKINGGG IDIOT LOL!!!! HOW BRAINWASHED ARE YOU SHEEPS!!!!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/khqijr/_/ggnhu2d/) [I'm vegan and pro-vax. But I am concerned about this particular vaccine. I'm worried about how quickly it's been rushed through development and approval and whether it's actually safe or considered safe enough on balance when compared to the counter-risk of COVID (a risk that, by the way since were speaking of people ignoring science, would be so much lower if people took it seriously and followed the rules). I will get it too, but I think the people getting it now are a lot braver "}
