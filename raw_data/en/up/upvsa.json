The Food and Drugs Authority's (FDA) guidelines for the registration of human vaccines provide guidance to applicants intending to register their product in Ghana. In addition, the guidelines publish the required format and content for submitting a veterinary vaccine registration application to the FDA, and provide guidance that ens ure that products and manufacturers meets the minimum established regulatory requirem ents to do business in Ghana. Human vaccines are products of biological origin, which exhibit some intrinsic variability. They are characterized by complex manufacturing p rocesses and are administered to large numbers of healthy infants, children, adolesce nts, and adults. Solely testing the final product alone cannot assess their quality; hence, a complete product development dossier, in addition, to a satisfactory current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) audit of the manufacturing facility shall be requi red to make a regulatory decision. The FDA fully evaluates all data and information submitted on the quality, safety and efficacy profiles of human vaccines application fo r completeness, and in line with requirements contained in these guidelines. The FDA shall register the vaccine and grant marketing authorization following satisfactory evaluation outcome. These guidelines provide guidance on the requisite data and informa tion that is needed in an application dossier, and evidence to show that the product development pathway contains information on the various stages of development; research, product development, production, quality control, non -clinal and clinical studies, and guarantees that the quality, safety and efficacy required of the vaccine to be u sed in humans has been established. 1.1 SCOPE The FDA guidance document applies to all registration application for vaccines intended for use in humans, regardless of whe re they were manufactured, whether they are licensed in the country of origin or not. The guidance document consisted of five modules (i.e. Module 1 - Module 5) and it is in Common Technical Document format. FDA/SMC/ BPD/GL-RVC/2014/05 Page 2 of 49 2.0 GLOSAARY The definitions herein apply to the harmonized requirements for the registration applications of vaccines and its guidelin e for preparation of application are included in this glossary in alphabetical order. Active ingredient of the vaccine: the antigenic substances (or compounds thereof) that can induce specific responses in humans against an infectious agent, its antigens o r toxins. Batch or lot: set of final packages of finished vaccine, hermetically sealed, that is homogeneous with respect to the risk o f cross -contamination during the packing and freeze -drying processes. Therefore, all final packages must have been filled from a single set of ingredients in a single working session and, if applicable, freeze -dried in standardiz ed conditions in the same r oom. Carrier protein: a protein used mainly in conjugated polysaccharide vaccines to which the polysaccharide antigen is l inked in order to improve both the magnitude a nd type of the immune response. Clinical particulars : These are indications for use, con tra-indications, undesirable effects (with reference to frequency and seriousness), precautions for use, dosage and method of administration, overdose, special warnings, major and minor incompatibilities ( If appropriate), special precautions during administration of the product, first aid and safety directions. Country of origin: it corresponds to the country where the legal certifications of the product are generated . Dosage form: the physical form in which a product is prepared for administration t o the recipient. Shelf life: it is the date before which the quality of the vaccine remains acceptable for its intended use as ou tlined in the market authorization. It is established based on stability studies. Final bulk product: any product that has gone through all stages of processing, including formu lation but not final packaging. Finished product : final pharmaceutical form tha t has gone through all steps of the manufacturing process, includ ing final packaging. FDA/SMC/ BPD/GL-RVC/2014/05 Page 3 of 49 Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP): set of procedures and practices to ensure consistent controlled production of batches of pharmaceutical products, according to proper quality standards for the intended use thereof and the conditio ns required for their sale. Immunological properties: These are the diseases and/or conditions that the product is designed to treat, prevent or detect and the type of immune response and corre lation with protection. If the type of response has not been determined, a general summary of what is kno wn about the infectious agent and the type of responses that are likely to be effective in conferring protection must be provided. Information on effic acy, claims and the duration of immunity must also be provided. Lot release: process for the evaluation o f each individual lot of vaccine submitted be used in the market; this means independent control of each lot to guarantee that all the lots produced an d used in a country are in compliance with the established quality specifications. This process can be performed by detailed review of Summary Protocols of Production and Quality Control, and includes laboratory testing w hen it is considered necessary. License: in some countries it is called registration. Procedure whereby the National Regulatory Authority gr ants permission for the product in question to be sold and distributed in the country. Master cell bank: culture of specific cells of known origin that are distributed in a container or packages in a single operation to ensure uniformity and stability in s torage. The master bank is usually kept at a temperature of -70\u00b0C or less. In some countries, it is called the primary bank. Product development: all s tudies to show that the dose, formulation, manufacturing process and packaging system, as well as the mic robiological properties, are approp riate for the proposed purpose. Product to be licensed: both, the document outlining the harmonized requirements for the licensing of vaccines in the Americas and its guidelines for preparation of application, apply to th e registration of vaccines in the Americas. The vaccine may b e also referred as the product. FDA/SMC/ BPD/GL-RVC/2014/05 Page 4 of 49 Raw materials: any substance used to make or extract the a ctive ingredient but from which the active ingredient is not directly derived. For example, culture media , fetal bovine serum, etc. Starting materials: any substance of biological origin, such as microorganisms, organs and tissues of plant or animal origin , including cells or fluids of human or animal origin a nd recombinant cell substrates. Validation: series of documented procedures or actions, consistent with good manufacturing practices, demonstrating that the processes, equipment, materials, activities and/or systems satisfy the predetermined specifications and quality attributes. Working cell bank: culture of cells derived from a master cell bank and intended to prepare production cultures. The working cell bank is usually kept at a temperature of -70\u00b0C or less. In some countries, it is called the secondary bank. 3.0 ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIR EMENTS The legal information accompanying the dossier should be d uly certified and authenticated under the procedure in effect in the country of origin, and issued by th e appropriate entity.

WHO Technical Report Series No. 924, 2005, or most recent version, and the FDA's guidelines for Clinical Trials. GENERAL COMMENTS Before beginning the clinical studies, it is necessary to have in -depth knowledge of the epidemiology of the pathogens or disease of interest in the study population. This knowledge makes it possible to statistically define the size of the sample required for the studies and to weigh the magnitude of the results for efficacy and safety. All clinical studies should comply with the international and local standards for good clinical practices. The clinical studies necessary to evaluate the cl inical efficacy of a vaccine that contains one or more new antigens can involve substantial requirements with regard to the size of the population, compared to known and previously evaluat ed antigens. It is reasonable to require immunogenicity and safety s tudies only for vaccines that contain known, widely -used antigens and where safety/reactogenicity/immunogenicity of protection have been well established. 5.1 TABLE OF CONTENTS OF MODULE 5 5.2 CONTENTS: REPORTS OF CLINICAL STUDIES PHASE I STUDIES. These are intended to define the safety and reactogenicity of the vaccine and to seek preliminary information on immunogenicity. Dose and route of administration should be evaluated with respect t o these parameters. Generally, these studies are conducted on smal l groups of immune competent healthy adults (50 to 200) who present low risk of being infected by the vaccine or related complications. PHASE II STUDIES. After the studies in phase I have be en completed or sufficient information is obtained to demonstrate satisfactory results, the phase II studies can begin. The main distinction between the two phases is that the phase II studies involve a large number (200 to 600) of subjects and are usually controlled and randomized. The FDA/SMC/ BPD/GL-RVC/2014/05 Page 41 of 49 main objectives of these studies a re to demonstrate the immunogenicity of the active component(s) and safety in the target population (mainly healthy children). The phase II studies should define the optimum dose, the vaccin ation schedule, and most importantly, safety, prior to beginning p hase III . PHASE III STUDIES. The Phase III studies are large scale studies designed to obtain data on the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. These studies are usually carried out in large populations to evaluate the efficacy and safety to the formulation (s) of the immunologically active component(s). Several thousand subjects can be enrolled in these studies (the number will be defined by the end point of the study). Serological data are co llected (for at least one immunized population subgroup) with the idea of establishing a correlation between clinical efficacy and immunogenicity, although this cannot always be established. The type of vaccine and other relevant factors (incidence of dise ase, immunological markers, and safety) will determine the duration of the follow - up on these studies and the number of participants. The phase III clinical studies should be performed using at least three lots manufactured on the industrial or production scale to be used routinely (in the majority of countries). SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS Depending on the type of vaccine, apart from the clinical studies on immunogenicity, efficacy, and reactogenicity, it may be necessary to evaluate microorganism shedding in t he case of live vaccines, interaction with other vaccines, and interference with maternal antibodies. ADJUVANT Evidence and scientific support that justifies the use of adjuvant, when applicable. COMBINED VACCINES OR VACCINES MADE BY NEW MANUFACTURERS Subm it information on bridging studies performed to ensure the non -inferiority of the vaccine under evaluation compared with the reference vaccine, supporting immunogenicity, reactogenicity, safety, and efficacy, when applicable. CO-ADMINISTRATION STUDIES WITH OTHER VACCINES 5.3 CLINICAL STUDY REPORTS FDA/SMC/ BPD/GL-RVC/2014/05 Page 42 of 49 5.3.6 PHASE IV STUDIES AND/OR PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN (IF APPLICABLE). Depending on the type of application for registration approval in other countries, or depending on the type of vaccine, a phase IV study protoc ol or the results of studies that have already b een performed will be required. For new vaccines, a pharmacovigilance and a risk management plan depending on the type of vaccine should be presented. 5.4 LITERATURE REFERENCES All literature references used in the study. FDA/SMC/ BPD/GL-RVC/2014/05 Page 43 of 49 ANNEXURE ANNEX I RISK MANAGEME NT PLAN (RMP) A Risk Management Plan (RMP) is a set of pharmacovigilance activities and interventions designed to identify, characterize, and manage risk relating to a medicine. The plan encompasses the entire l ife cycle of the product, and has to be perio dically updated to reflect new knowledge and understanding of the safety profile of the product. Thus, the applicant is responsible for: developing a RMP updating the RMP as new safety information emerges implem enting the activities and interventions outlined in the RMP Collecting information and performing an analysis regarding the efficacy of these activities and interventions Communicating this information to the GHFDA in a timely manner The FDA will request t hat a RMP is submitted bef ore the biological product is registered. Also, the FDA can request a RMP be submitted for a biological product which has already been registered, when a safety issue arises. A RMP should include, but not limited to the following: an overview of the safety profile of the biological product a pharmacovigilance plan a risk management plan A RMP should be submitted: with an application for a new vaccine with an application for paediatric use registration application with an applicati on involving a significant change in registration approval (e.g. new dosage form, new route of administration, significant change in indication, including new paediatric indication) unless it has been agreed with the FDA that submission of a RMP is not req uired on the request of the FDA (pre - and post -registration) FDA/SMC/ BPD/GL-RVC/2014/05 Page 44 of 49 in the initiative of applicant/ marketing Authorization holder when they identify a safety concern at any stage of the life cycle of the vaccine Applicants should consult the FDA on any questions they may have about their responsibilities relating to this section of the guidelines.
