According to the National Survey of Children with Special Healthcare Needs, 11.2 million children are at risk for chronic conditions that can affect their physical, emotional, and social well -being.1 Conditions such as asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, food allergies, obesity, and mental health issues can hinder academic achievement if not given proper attention. Schools can assist in managing these conditions by administering medications and treatments during the school day. Due to the variety of medications and treatments administered in schools, school nurses and trained school health staff can assist with administering medications, monitoring adherence to medication regimens, and providing recommendations to protect the health and safety of students. This document is intended to serve as a reference and illustrative guide for local school boards, charter school leadership, school administrators, and school health staff in creating and implementing school district policies and administrative regulations related to medication administration. Any portion of this document may be reproduced for educational purposes or policy development. Guide to Medication Administration in the School Setting 3 Laws Related to Medication Administration There are federal and state laws that need to be considered when developing school policy and administrative regulations for administering medications in the school setting. Below is a list of some of the laws that could impact the development of school policies. Federal laws of interest include the following: 1. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act1 Section 504 is a federal law designed to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities in programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance from the U.S. Department of Education. To be protected under Section 504, a student must be determined to: (1) have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; or (2) have a record of such an impairment; or (3) be regarded as having such an impairment. Section 504 requires that school districts provide a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) to qualified students in their jurisdictions who have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. 2. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)2 The ADA prohibits discrimination and guarantees that people with disabilities have the same opportunities to participate in state and local government programs including education and services. 3. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act3 The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires public schools to make available to all eligible children with disabilities a free, appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment appropriate to their individual needs. IDEA requires public school systems to develop appropriate Individualized Education Programs (IEP's) for each child. 4. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act4 The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. State laws of interest include the following: 1. Texas Education Code (TEC), Chapter 22 and Chapter 381 TEC Section 22.052 outlines the establishment of a district policy, parental consent, proper labeling, and civil immunity for medication administration in schools. TEC Section 38.0152 describes a students ' ability to self -administer asthma and allergy medication and gives details of what is required to do so. 2. Health and Safety Code (HSC), Chapter 168 HSC Sections 168.001 to Section 168.011 describes what is permitted and required for students with diabetes to manage their disease, carry and administer their medication while on school property or at school related events or activities. Guide to Medication Administration in the School Setting 4 Civil Immunity Texas Education Code Chapter 22, Section 22.0521 describes how school personnel are protected from civil liability from damages or injuries resulting from the administration of medication to a student. Permission to administer medication is granted to employees of the school district, when assigned by school principals or superintendents. The law grants immunity to all school district employees including unlicensed school personnel. The responsibility of administering medications to students is considered an administrative task assigned by the principal, rather than a health -related service delivered or delegated by a health care professional.2 It is important to note that nurses must practice according to the Texas Board of Nursing 's Standards of Nursing Practice which is outlined in Texas Administrative Code Chapter 217, Rule 217.11 , and the Nursing Practice Act outlined in Texas Occupations Code Chapter 301 .3,4 The only non -employees of the school district permitted to administer medication to students (and these, only if granted authority by the board of trustees and written in board policy) are volunteer licensed physicians and registered nurses whom the district provides liability insurance. This is outlined in Texas Education Code Chapter 22, Section 22.052 (b). Children with Food Allergies At -Risk for Anaphylaxis In addition to the federal and state laws previously discussed, children with food allergies may require emergency treatment including the use of medications. A severe food allergy is a dangerous or life -threatening reaction of the human body to a foodborne allergen introduced by inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact that requires immediate medical attention. According to the Texas Education Code Chapter 25, Section 25.0022 , the school district shall request by form or otherwise, that the parent and/or guardian disclose if their child has a food allergy.1 The disclosure should include the food that the child is allergic to, and the type of reaction the child experiences. It is important that this information is disclosed to schools so school personnel are aware of the allergy and can act appropriately in emergency situations. Beyond what is required to be disclosed for children with food allergies, it is recommended that school health staff collect the following information from parents and guardians, to be informed and prepared to serve all students: Emergency contact number and address of the prescribing provider. Emergency contact information of the parent/guardian(s). Student 's diagnosis (reason for the medication) and anticipated length of treatment. Special handling instructions for the medication. Serious reaction(s) that can result from either administering or withholding the medication. Guide to Medication Administration in the School Setting 5 Other medications the student is taking, including herbal medications, dietary supplements, and/or over -the -counter (OTC) medication. Other allergies the student has. Other health problems or illnesses that the student has. Explanation as to why the medication cannot be administered at home. Description of if the medication has been given at home, and any observed reactions. Explanation of who will bring the medication to the school. Policy and Administrative Regulation Development Texas law requires the local school board to adopt a medication administration policy before medication can be administered to students. The Texas Association of School Boards (TASB), through their policy services division, assists local school boards in writing district policies. TASB states that all school districts should have medication administration policies and administrative regulations in place, based on their individual needs, that outline safe and effective medication administration.1 TASB writes both legal and local policy for school districts and assists with the development of administrative regulations utilizing sample templates. Before administering any medication to a student, school personnel should review all policies and administrative regulations related to medication administration to students. Administrative Regulations Administrative regulations outline the specific details that are to be followed in administering medication to students. They are developed by the superintendent or their designee and are utilized by all school employees. TASB helps school superintendents develop administrative regulations by utilizing templates that outline best practice and are customizable for local school districts.1 These templates are part of the policy services provided by TASB. Local school districts may independently develop the administrative regulations related to medication administration with input from health services personnel. It is important that any staff assigned to administer medication to students follow the administrative regulations of the school district. Obtaining Parental Consent Once a medication policy and administrative regulations have been adopted, the school can seek the necessary permissions from parents or guardians to establish consent for administering the medication. According to the TEC, Section 22.052 , for any medication to be administered in school, a written request from the parent, legal guardian, or other person having legal control of the student must be received by the school district.1 In order to be in compliance with the Texas Family Code Chapter 32, Section 32.002 , the form should include the following information: 1. the name of the child; 2. the name of one or both parents, if known, and the name of any managing conservator or guardian of the child; Guide to Medication Administration in the School Setting 6 3. the name of the person giving consent and the person's relationship to the child; 4. a statement of the nature of the medical treatment to be given; and 5. the date the treatment is to begin.2 It is recommended that school district policy and administrative regulations address the duration that the parental consent form is valid.3 In addition to the information required to provide consent, the request form to administer medication from a parent or legal guardian should also include the following information: The name of the medication to be administered The dose to be administered The route of administration The number of days the medication is to be given The time(s) of day the medication is to be given The reason the medication is needed Possible side effects of the medication Special requirements for administration, such as \"take with food \" Special storage instructions In the event of a medication change, school health staff will need to update the student 's health record with a new medication authorization form, signed by the parent, before the medication can be administered. Medication Administration Schedules Many medications prescribed for school -aged children can be administered at home by the child's parent or legal guardian. For example, if a medication is to be administered three times a day, it can be given every eight hours. Most students are not in school for more than eight hours, and therefore, parents/guardians should consider administering medication before and after school, and then at bedtime. The school nurse may help parent/guardian(s) work with their student 's health care provider to adjust the schedule so that the parent/guardian may administer the medication at home. When medication administration is required during the school day, school health staff (typically the school nurse) or the principal 's designee are responsible for medication administration. Original, Properly Labeled Containers In order for any medication to be administered in the school setting, it must be from a container that appears to be the original container and be properly labeled; or from a properly labeled unit dosage container filled by a registered nurse or another qualified district employee.1 According to US Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration 's Informational Outline of the Controlled Substance Act, information required on prescription labels includes the following: Date of filling Pharmacy name and address The serial (prescription) number Guide to Medication Administration in the School Setting 7 The name of the patient The name of the prescribing practitioner Directions for use Any cautionary statements2 It is recommended that all medications brought to school for administration be counted or measured, and the initial quantity be recorded in the student 's record. If feasible, the medication should be counted with the parent or legal guardian present, and signed off in the student 's record. Parents may also record the initial quantity of medication, send it to the school, and upon arrival school health staff may confirm the recorded amount with another staff person present. Extra precautions should be taken when handling controlled substances (drugs). Controlled drugs (such as Ritalin and Adderall) are substances that have potential for abuse, physical dependence, psychological dependence, with varying degrees of medical acceptance and restrictions on usage.3 Controlled drugs should be counted on arrival to the school, daily by the individual administering the medication, and at least weekly with a witness.4 All counts should be recorded in the student 's medication record by all present witnesses.5 Over the Counter Medication It is to the discretion of the local school board to decide whether or not they will permit the administration of over the counter (OTC) medication to students. School district policy related to OTC medication should comply with Texas Education Code Section 22.052 , and require that OTC medication arrive to school in their original, properly labeled container.1 Parental consent should be provided for OTC medication through completion of a medication administration authorization form. To assure safe delivery, all medications should be brought to the school by the parent or a responsible adult, especially for elementary school students.2 If policy permits the administration of OTC medication, then it is recommended that formal policies regarding the duration that OTC medication may be administered, be in place. If school district policy permits over -the -counter medication to be kept at the school, to be administered on an \"as-needed \" basis, it is suggested that physicians ' orders be provided to the school. Written parental authorizations for these medication must also be provided to school health staff. Each time one of these medication is distributed to a student in need, the administration should be logged in the student 's record.3 Furthermore, long -term need for OTC medication may indicate the need for clinical evaluation and possible treatment. School health staff should communicate with parents and legal guardians about these concerns as they see appropriate. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends consulting the student 's primary care provider for their insight and approval.4 School districts should not provide any medication for students or personnel. Only medication provided by and requested by a parent/guardian should be dispensed. If medication is provided, school districts and school nurses will be in the position of not only \"diagnosing and prescribing, \" but also in \"dispensing \" medication for which they are not licensed. \"Medication \" is recognized as prescription as well as nonprescription drugs and includes, but is not limited to: analgesics, antipyretics, antacids, antibiotic Guide to Medication Administration in School Setting 8 ointments, antihistamines, decongestants, and cough/cold preparations.5 Herbal Medications School personnel may be asked by a student 's parent or guardian to administer an herbal or dietary supplement to a student during the school day. Such treatments are on the rise in the U.S. and are referred to as complementary and alternative medicine. In the pediatric population, the use of alternative medicines is utilized more often with children with chronic illnesses. According to the National Institutes of Health: National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health, \"Children 's small size, developing organs, and immature immune system make them more vulnerable than adults to having allergic or other adverse reactions to dietary supplements. \"1 In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns parents in the use of such medications due to the fact that homeopathic remedies and dietary supplements are not evaluated by the FDA for safety or effectiveness.2 The Texas Association of School Boards policy template includes information about the administration of herbal substances or dietary supplements provided by the parent. The template states that this request must be written into the Individualized Education Program or the Section 504 plan for a student with disabilities. School personnel should check their local board policy and administrative regulations before administering any herbal substance, including essential oils or dietary supplements. Nurses should check the Considerations for School Nurses section in this publication for information related to administration of herbals or dietary supplements. Administration of herbal medications by school personnel other than registered nurses, including LVNs, would not be held to the same standard and would be considered an administrative task assigned by a school principal, rather than delegated by an RN. School administrators can make decisions about assigning this task accordingly. Medication Errors \"A medication error is any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the health care professional, patient, or consumer. Such events may be related to professional practice, health care products, procedures, and systems, including prescribing; order communication; product monitoring; and use. \"1 In the medication administration process, there are many opportunities for errors. These errors may be tied to the distributors of the medication (school personnel), the purveyors of the medication (parents, legal guardians, students) and the recipients of the medication (students). There are also opportunities for medication errors to occur prior to the medications ' arrival to the school. As described previously, medication should arrive to school in a properly labeled, original container.2 The medication should be accompanied by a completed and signed medication authorization form.2 Failure to provide medication in this manner, would be considered a medication error. The greatest opportunity for medication errors are during the actual medication administration process. During administration, missteps can occur by violating any one Guide to Medication Administration in the School Setting 9 of the eight rights of medication administration. Errors in medication administration can occur in the following ways: 1. The wrong patient -A medication is administered to the wrong student. 2. The wrong drug -A student is administered the wrong medication. 3. The wrong dose -A student is administered the wrong dose of medication. 4. The wrong route -A medication is administered in the wrong manner. 5. The wrong time -A medication is not administered during its specified time window. 6. The wrong documentation -The administration of a medication is not documented, a medication error is not recorded, or an administration is logged in the wrong record. 7. The wrong diagnosis -A medication is administered that does not properly suit the student 's underlying condition. No action to confirm that the medication is suitable is taken. 8. The wrong response -A medication is administered but the student is not held for the observation of side effects. Side effects typically reflect that an error occurred in one of the prior steps. The source of the error can be the individual, the system they are operating in, or a combination of both. Factors that can contribute to individual medication errors can be inattention, haste, distraction, and fatigue.3 Common system errors in the school setting can be lack of knowledge, lack of training, time constraints, and work -load.4 Providing school health staff with annual training and medication administration skills assessments can help prevent errors in medication administration. Medication errors can also be attributable to the student. Students may forget to come receive their medications, which is considered an error. If a student does not come to receive their medication, school health staff should attempt to contact the student and confirm their presence or absence that day. If they are on school grounds, inquire about them missing their dose. If they still do not come to the health office, then the parents or legal guardians should be contacted. Medication errors are preventable but will still happen in the school setting. It is important that medication errors are documented as they occur, in detail. Research has demonstrated that there are many barriers to reporting errors. Those barriers include fear of disciplinary action, the inability to report anonymously, and belief that it is unnecessary to report errors because no negative outcomes were observed in the patient.1 If medication errors continue to be ignored, then strategies to prevent errors cannot be implemented. Therefore it is recommended that district policy and administrative regulations reflect that all errors are to be recorded to help educate staff with prevention strategies for the future. If a medication error occurs in the school setting, then the following procedures are recommended: 1. Keep the student in the health room. If the student has returned to class, then have someone accompany the student back to the health room. 2. Observe the student 's status, and document what you see. Guide to Medication Administration in the School Setting 10 3. Identify the source of the medication error (incorrect dose, medication, route etc.) 4. Notify the principal and school health services lead if medication was administered by trained, unlicensed assistive personnel. 5. Follow instructions from the Poison Control Center, if possible. If unable to a. The school health services lead will contact the parents, legal guardian, and/or the student 's healthcare provider. b. If contacting the Poison Control Center for instructions: i. Give the name and dose of the medication taken in error ii. Give the student 's age and approximate weight if possible iii. Give the name and dose of any other medication the student receives, if possible follow their instructions, explain the problem to the Poison Control Center thoroughly and determine if the student should be transported to emergency care. 6. Complete a medication error report form. Carefully record all circumstances and actions taken, including instructions from the Poison Control Center or the student 's healthcare provider, and the student 's status. All reports are to be filed and kept according to district policy.5 Special Considerations for Medication Administration Asthma and Anaphylaxis Medications According to Texas Education Code Chapter 38, Section 38.015 , students are permitted to possess and self -administer prescription asthma or anaphylaxis medicine. The student must demonstrate to the student 's physician or healthcare provider, and the school nurse if available, that they demonstrate the skills necessary to self - administer the medication. The physician and parents must sign an authorization form indicating consent to self -administer and specific information that provides details outlining whether the student has asthma or anaphylaxis, and the purpose, dosage, frequency, and duration of the medication to be self -administered. School personnel that will be supervising the student during regular school hours and during school -related extracurricular activities, should be informed that the student is self -carrying medication with the intention to self -administer if necessary. Diabetes Medications Health and Safety Code Chapter 168, Section 168.008 , allows students with diabetes to self -carry and administer medication to manage their condition respectively. Student 's management activities should be outlined in their Diabetes Management and Treatment Plan and their Individualized Healthcare Plan. Activities may include but are not limited to performing blood glucose checks, administering insulin, treating hypo or hyperglycemia, and possessing supplies or equipment on their person to monitor and care for diabetes. Guide to Medication Administration in the School Setting 11 In order to self -manage, a student 's Diabetes Management and Treatment Plan must evaluate if the student is mature enough and has demonstrated the skills to self - manage, and be signed by the parent and the physician or healthcare provider. It is recommended that the ability to manage and properly self -administer diabetes medications is demonstrated to the school nurse or school health staff at regular intervals to ensure the student can safely and correctly self -administer their medication and manage their diabetes. School personnel that will be supervising the student during regular school hours, and during school -related extracurricular activities should be informed that the student is self -carrying with the intention to self - administer if necessary. Emergency Medications In emergency situations, schools should be ready to administer emergency care. To prepare for emergencies that can be reasonably anticipated, school districts should have first aid policies and emergency management practices in place.1 The school district 's policy should reflect staff responsibilities and district expectations for staff action in emergency situations. Staff should be cognizant of which students may need emergency care and should be aware of their role in caring for these students in the event that emergency response is needed. When drafting emergency medication policies, school districts should consider emergency medication administration across all potential school -related settings including in classrooms, on the playground, at school -based health centers, during before -or after -school programs, on field trips, on busses, and at athletic events.2 If a school nurse is available, then they should assist in developing and implementing the emergency plan. Each school should provide the name, phone number, and general location of the school nurse and other trained school health staff on campus who are cleared to administer emergency medications. Offsite Medication Administration If the student participates in an offsite, school -related activity and will need medication administered to them, then a plan should be in place to do so. School personnel that are responsible for the student needing medication should be aware of the student 's healthcare plan prior to departure from school grounds. It is not necessary for a nurse to accompany students off school grounds to administer medication. Texas Education Code, Chapter 22, Section 22.052 allows principals to assign other school employees to administer medication, without liability, as long as they abide by the district medication policy and administrative regulations.1 Only the necessary dose of medication should travel offsite, along with a copy of the parental medication authorization form. Medication doses should be prepared on school grounds, before departure. School districts will need to develop administrative regulations about documentation of medication administration that occurs during off site school -related activities. It is recommended that documentation procedures, mirror those that occur on school grounds. Considerations for School Nurses Texas Administrative Code, Rule 217.11 are the standards of care that all licensed and registered nurses must comply with in practicing nursing in Texas. Standard 217.11(C) requires nurses to know the rationale for and the effects of the medications and treatments that they administer to students.1 In addition, Standard 217.11(T) requires Guide to Medication Administration in the School Setting 12 nurses to only accept assignments that they consider commensurate with their educational preparation, experience, knowledge, physical and emotional ability and within their scope of practice.1 According to Standard 217.11(N), if a nurse is unsure of the dosage or efficaciousness of the medication to be administered, they are required to seek clarification from the student 's prescribing practitioner.1 If a nurse decides not to administer a medication, then they should notify the ordering practitioner with their decision.1 In the case of herbals, homeopathic medicines, vitamins, traditional or cultural treatments, salves, nutritional supplements, and over the counter medications, the Board of Nursing has made the following statement: \"We often hear from school nurses who have been asked to administer herbal medications and/or supplements. Please keep in mind that the Texas Nursing Practice Act and Board rules are written broadly to apply to all nurses, including advanced practice registered nurses, across all practice settings. As such, neither are prescriptive to specific tasks/services any level of nurse may perform or provide. Likewise, they do not address specific practice settings for specific categories of advanced practice registered nurses. In terms of medication administration and treatments, the Nursing Practice Act (NPA) states that RNs \"administer a medication or treatment as ordered by a physician, podiatrist, or dentist \" [NPA 301.002(2)(C)]. The Standards of Nursing Practice, found in Board Rule 217.11 , that apply to all nurses provide some additional direction regarding this situation. Some of the more applicable standards addressed in Board Rule 217.11 include: (A):Requires the nurse to know and conform to the Texas Nursing Practice Act and the Board 's rules and regulations as well as all federal, state, or local laws, rules or regulations affecting the nurse 's current area of nursing practice; Therefore school nurses should be familiar with the Texas Education Code and how it affects their delivery of nursing services to students (e.g. section 22.052(a) addresses medication administration in the school setting). With these statutory requirements in mind, school nurses must make the decision whether or not they will administer herbal medications/products. (B): Implement measures to promote a safe environment for clients and others; (C): Requires a nurse to know the rationale for and the effects of medications and treatments and shall correctly administer the same; (G) and (H): Requires a nurse to obtain instruction, supervision, orientation and training when encountering or incorporating a new task; This aids in determining if the nurse personally possesses current clinical competence to perform the task safely from knowledge acquired in a basic nursing education program, post -basic program, or continuing education program. (N): When nurses have questions or concerns about orders or recommended treatment regimens, they must clarify these orders with the ordering practitioner and notify him or her if the nurse believes the order is non - Guide to Medication Administration in the School Setting 13 efficacious, contraindicated, or inaccurate and when the nurse makes the decision not to administer the medication or treatment; (T): Accept only those nursing assignments that take into consideration client safety and that are commensurate with the nurse's educational preparation, experience, knowledge, and physical and emotional ability; Prior to administration of medications nurses must ensure that they have the requisite knowledge and skill to safely accept an assignment. Each nurse is accountable to accept only assignments that are within the nurse 's ability. If a nurse accepts an assignment to administer herbal medications, then he/she is responsible for adhering to the NPA and Board Rules in delivering safe patient care. The BON has presented the issue of alternative/complementary therapies and the RN's role in Position Statement 15.23 The Use of Complementary Modalities by the LVN or RN. Regardless of the practice setting, nurses who incorporate complementary modalities into their practice are accountable and responsible for adherence to the NPA and BON Rules and Regulations. Specific regulations of particular relevance are identified in this position statement, including a reference to the BON 's Six -Step Decision Making Model for Determining Nursing Scope of Practice. Also, a list of criteria is included in order for nurses to show accountability for the care they provide. Lastly, nurses are accountable to hold proper credentials (e.g., license, certification, registration) to safely engage in specific practices, where applicable. Please keep in mind that a nurse functions under his/her own nursing license, and as such has a duty to patients that is separate from any employment relationship. In other words, a physician's order, facility policy or a directive from a non -nursing supervisor cannot supersede a nurse's duty to keep a patient(s) safe ( Position Statement 15.14, Duty of a Nurse in Any Practice Setting ).\" General Procedures for Medication Administration Medication Verification When preparing to administer medications to a student it is important to review the eight \"rights \" for safe medication administration: 1. Right patient -Assure the right patient is receiving the right drug by checking two unique patient identifiers before administering medication. This can be verified by asking the student their name and their birthday. 2. Right drug -Check the name of the drug to be administered with the drug that is listed on the student 's medication authorization form. Check the name on the prescription bottle if administering a prescription medication. 3. Right dose -Check the student 's medication authorization form and the prescription bottle to determine the proper dose to be administered. If administering an over the counter medication, check the dosage on the package. If the dose seems higher or lower than expected, then consult the student 's prescribing physician. Guide to Medication Administration in the School Setting 14 4. Right route -Check the student 's medication authorization form and the prescription 's label to determine the proper route to administer the medication. 5. Right time -Check the student 's authorization form, the prescription bottle or over the counter package instructions to determine that the administration schedule is being followed. 6. Right documentation -Document administering medication in the student 's records immediately after completion. 7. Right diagnosis -According to the description of the student 's condition, outlined in their medication authorization form, determine if the drug is suitable for treating their condition. If the prescription does not seem suitable, then consult the primary care physician. 8. Right response -After the drug has been administered, assure that the desired effect takes place. If quality checks are performed, then record them in the student 's record.1 Storage To promote safe medication administration, it is recommended that each school district have storage policies and administrative regulations in place. For medications that have been provided to schools with written authorization, it is advised that school health staff store medication in a locked cabinet or drawer, with medications placed on a secure, solid surface.1 It is preferable that the storage container have a solid rather than opaque door.1 Medications that require refrigeration should be stored in the refrigerator in a locked box.2 To maintain the integrity of the medications, the temperature of the refrigerator should be monitored.1 Temperatures should be maintained between 33 and 45 degrees Farenheit.3 Access to locked medication should be limited to designated school health staff, the principal, and/or other authorized staff.2 A list of authorized staff should be kept and maintained by the school principal. To assure that authorized staff can access locked medications, keys to medication storage should never leave the school grounds. When managing student 's medication, it is advised that only a month 's supply of medication be stored at the school. Requiring a parent or legal guardian to bring in each month 's supply on a mutually agreed upon date will assist the nurse or school health staff in maintaining the store of medications. During the drop -off period, parents and school health staff can discuss the status of the student 's condition and implementation of their designated care plan. Handling Medication The following section was adapted from the Kentucky Department of Education 's Medication Administration Training Manual for Non -Licensed School Personnel.1 Hand Washing. Before administering medication to students, it is important for school health staff to wash their hands. If it is necessary for the student to touch the medication then they should wash their hands. It is best practice to use soap and water, especially if hands are visibly soiled. When soap and water are not available it is recommended that alcohol -based hand sanitizers are used. The following steps should be taken to properly cleanse hands: 1. Wet hands with water Guide to Medication Administration in the School Setting 15 2. Use soap to scrub hands for 20 seconds 3. Scrub backs of hands, wrists, between fingers, and under fingernails 4. Rinse with water 5. Towel dry 6. Turn off the faucet with towel When hand -sanitizer is available, and soap and water is not: 1. Apply a nickel size of sanitizer in the palm of the hand 2. Rub hands together, covering all surfaces until hands are dry (approximately 20 seconds) Avoid Touching Medication. Pour pills, tablets, or capsules into the bottle cap then distribute them into a disposable medicine cup. A clean paper towel or mini paper cup may be used if the medicine to be administered is only one pill, capsule or tablet. Kids can take the medication themselves, by putting it in their mouth. If it is necessary for school health staff to administer the medication to the student 's mouth directly then disposable gloves must be used. Be aware of any allergies the students may have, especially to latex. Dispose of the gloves once the medication has been administered. Cutting or Crushing Tablets. Scored tablets that must be cut in half to obtain a smaller dose should be cut by the school nurse, a licensed healthcare provider, or the student 's dispensing pharmacist. Cutting, crushing, or sprinkling of medications are examples of changing the form of an oral medication. Changing the form of the medication should be avoided unless doing so is advised on the prescription 's label. If the form of the medication must be changed, then leave the task to trained or licensed school health staff. Measuring Liquid Medication. When preparing liquid medication, follow the directions on the bottle regarding shaking of the medication. Remove the bottle cap and place it, bottle side face up, on a solid surface. Liquid medications should be measured to ensure accurate dosage. A marked medicine cup, oral syringe, or dropper should be used to ensure accuracy. Find the marks on the measurement tool that correspond to the dose the prescription calls for. When pouring the medication into the container, or filling the syringe, hold the container so the label is in the palm of your hand to prevent spillage that could cause the label to become illegible. For medication that is poured into a medicine cup, look at the medicine cup at eye level when filling it up, to ensure an accurate amount is poured. If more than one liquid medication is to be administered to a student, then measure each medication separately. Documentation In the school setting, documentation promotes high quality student health services, increases efficiency, and creates a legal record of health services provided to students. A student 's health record should provide a chronological map of their demographics, medical diagnoses, medications, immunizations, screening results, and school health staff's notes to complete the picture. To ensure complete record keeping, records of each student 's visits should be logged, labeled with the time and date of the visit, the school health staff 's name, the reason the student was seeking health services, the school health staff 's recommended course of action, and the outcomes of the visit.1 From a legal perspective, if it was not documented then it did not occur. Guide to Medication Administration in the School Setting 16 As recommended by the School Nurse Resource Manual: A Guide to Practice, every school should keep an individual medication log for each medication a student receives.2 Every time a dose is administered, the medication administrator should document the action and sign the record.1 In the case of trained unlicensed assistive personnel, documenting the medication administration process should be done regardless of if a nurse is present or not.2 National standards further recommend that each student 's medication log be distinct, and that a running administration log for all students be avoided.2 According to the National Association of School Nurses (NASN) Principles of Documentation, nursing documentation should be accurate, objective, concise, thorough, timely and well organized. NASN offers the following recommendations to reach documentation standards: Entries should be legible and written in ink or on a computer. The ink should be black or blue Computerized records should be secure and password -protected The date and exact time should be included with each entry Documentation should include any nursing action taken in response to a student 's problem Assessment data should include significant findings, both positive and negative Records, progress notes, Individual Healthcare Plans, and flow charts should be kept current Documentation should include only essential information; precise measurements, correct spelling, and standard abbreviations should be used Documentation should be based on nursing classification and include uniform data sets The frequency of documentation should be consistent over time and based on district policy, nursing protocols, and the acuity of the student 's health status Standardized healthcare plans increase efficiency of documentation and are acceptable to use so long as they are adapted to the individual needs of each student Student symptoms, concerns, and health maintenance questions (subjective data) should be documented in the student 's own words Only facts (objective data) relevant to the student 's care and clinical nursing judgements should be recorded; personal judgements and opinions of the school health staff should be omitted2-4 Disposal If a medication is no longer needed, parents or legal guardians should notify the school and arrange to retrieve the medication from school property.3 At the conclusion of the school year, school health staff should communicate a time and date when medications stored at the school can be retrieved. If medications are not retrieved by a parent or legal guardian, it is appropriate to dispose of medication at the end of the school year or after the expiration date if the medication is discontinued.2 Guide to Medication Administration in the School Setting 17 While there is no specific law in Texas related to medication disposal, the Texas Health and Safety Code does address disposal of \"sharps. \" This would include all needles, including epinephrine auto -injectors. Under the Texas Health and Safety Code Chapter 81, Section 81.304 , the executive commissioner adopted minimum standards to implement a blood borne pathogen exposure control plan, with these rules being aligned with the standards adopted by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.4 All needles should be disposed of according to the local school districts Exposure Control Plan (ECP). It is the school district 's responsibility to make arrangements with custodial staff, district, and other relevant agencies to have medications disposed of in accordance with local regulations. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also offers recommendations for the safe disposal of medications. U.S. Food and Drug Administration's recommendations are as follows: Follow any disposal directions provided on the prescription 's label. Do not flush medications down the sink or toilet, unless instructed to do so. Pursue local drug recycling programs that can take care of proper disposal for customers, if available. Centers in Texas can be located at: texastakeback.com/texasrecycles/hard -to-recycle/pharmacueticals.5 Call local law enforcement agencies and/or your local household trash and recycling service to learn about disposal options in the area. Consult a pharmacist about proper disposal practices.6 If no disposal instructions are provided on the label and no take -back programs are locally available, then follow these steps to dispose of medication in the trash: Remove the medication from the container and mix with an undesirable substance such as coffee grounds, dirt, or kitty litter. Place the mixture in a sealable bag or container to prevent the drug from leaking in the garbage. Needles and lancets need to be disposed of in a puncture proof container, marked in red, with a biohazard label, and disposed of in accordance with the local ECP 1,2 Asthma inhalers may be disposed of in the trash2 Once medication is properly disposed of, disposal should be documented by signing and dating the action in the student 's medication record to indicate that it has been destroyed.3 Guide to Medication Administration in the School Setting 18 Procedures for Various Routes of Medication Administration The following section provides step by step guidance on how to administer medications in different ways, depending on what a medication 's label calls for.

School Board The Texas Association of School Boards (TASB), through their policy services division, assists many public school boards in writing district policies. TASB states that all school districts should have medication administration policies and administrative regulations in place, based on their individual needs that outline safe and effective medication administration. TASB writes both legal and local policy for school districts and assists with the development of administrative regulations.1 According to Chapter 22, Section 22.052 of the Texas Education Code, upon adoption of policies concerning medication administration in a school district, its board of trustees and its employees are immune from civil liability. Immunity from the outcomes of medication administration is only applicable if the school has received a medication authorization form, serving as parental and provider consent, and if the medication was provided to the school in its original, properly labeled container.2 School Administrators District superintendents, school principals, and health service coordinators are charged with the task of assuring that the policies and procedures outlined in their districts ' medication administration policy are being implemented and executed effectively. School administrators assist in coordinating and determining which medication administration tasks will be performed by which school personnel. According to TEC, Chapter 22, Section 22.052 , the responsibility of administering medications to students is considered an administrative task assigned by the principal, rather than a health -related service delivered or delegated by a health care professional.2 It is essential that the school health staff (the school nurse or other trained unlicensed assistive personnel in the absence of a nurse), is qualified to perform the tasks outlined in their district 's medication policy. School administrators work with the school health staff lead to coordinate trainings for unlicensed assistive personnel on a regular basis. In addition to helping coordinate trainings, school administrators assist the school nurse in educating parents and/or guardians about the district 's policy for medication administration. Registered Nurse (School Nurse) Licensed by the Texas Board of Nursing, a school nurse is a registered nurse who provides services on school campuses to meet the health needs of students and staff, and/or who supervises and trains other staff to do so.3 The school nurse is responsible for implementing the school district 's health policies and procedures. School nurse duties include managing students ' health conditions, promoting health and safety in the school setting, and collaborating with parents, staff, and community members to develop plans to best serve students. Guide to Medication Administration in the School Setting 32 Licensed Vocational Nurse Licensed by the Texas Board of Nursing, a vocational nurse provides services to meet the needs of the students on a school campus under the clinical supervision of a School Nurse. The LVN's duties may include attending to the health needs of the student population and students with identified health conditions, following school health protocols and Individualized Healthcare Plans, assisting with mandatory screenings, and performing other necessary tasks to maintain student 's health under the direction of the supervising RN.3 Trained Unlicensed Assistive Personnel According to Texas Education Code, Chapter 22, Section 22.052, permission to administer medication may be granted to employees of the school district, when authorized by superintendents, school principals, or health service coordinators.2 These employees do not need to be licensed health care professionals but are expected to be competent and only carry out tasks for which they are knowledgeable.4 Parent(s) and/or Guardian(s) Parents and or guardians are important to the medication administration process, serving as a responsible voice for students and a source of consent and verification regarding a student 's overall health. The major responsibilities of parent(s) and/or guardian(s) are the following: Assure that medications are authorized by the child 's primary care provider. Provide a medication authorization form to school health staff outlining instructions for administering the student 's medication, potential contraindications, and the underlying reason that the medication needs to be administered. This serves as parental consent. Provide medication to the school in its original, properly labeled container with any additional information that the district 's policy requires. Retrieve student 's medication from the school when it is no longer needed by the student or at the conclusion of the school year. Communicate with the school regarding any changes in the student 's health status, medication regimen, primary care provider, or emergency contact information. Provide consent for school health staff to communicate with the child's prescribing physician.5 Primary Care Provider (Physician, Nurse Practitioner, or Physician 's Assistant) The primary care provider 's main role in student 's medication administration includes writing prescriptions or orders for school health staff. Prescriptions should include the name of the medication, the dosage, the time it is to be administered, the frequency it is to be administered, and the duration that it is to be administered (number of days). Furthermore, primary care providers should be available to communicate medication instructions, and any other important details to the parents, students, the school nurse, and other unlicensed assistive personnel as necessary.5 Guide to Medication Administration in the School Setting 33 School Personnel School personnel should be knowledgeable of their school district 's policies surrounding school health services, specifically medication administration.3 For medication administration, it is important that all school staff are aware of what their districts policies are for self -administration, administration on field trips, and emergency medication administration. For emergency medications, staff should be aware of students who carry their medication with them with the intention to self -administer. Also, all staff should be aware of where stock epinephrine is stored on school grounds (if applicable), for response to students that appear to be experiencing an anaphylactic reaction. A running list of school staff that are qualified to respond in emergencies, and which staff carry keys to medication in locked storage should be kept and maintained by the school prinicipal.6 References 1.
