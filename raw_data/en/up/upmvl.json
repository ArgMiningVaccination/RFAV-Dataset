Similarly, the risk of ICU admission was 36% lower. In this period, hospital admissions were highest in the age groups of 80 years and up. Since early March, a downward trend has been observed in the number of COVID-19 hospital admissions. People who do not have the same vaccination status may also have differences in vulnerability (underlying health conditions) or the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections they have had. A comparison between the relative risk of hospital admission between people with a different vaccination status therefore cannot be exclusively used to indicate vaccine effectiveness. Everyone who has been invited to get a COVID-19 vaccination in the basic series, but has not yet done so, can still be vaccinated. In addition, since 19 September 2022, it is possible to get a [repeat vaccination](https://www.rivm.nl/en/covid-19-vaccination/questions-and-background-information/repeat-vaccination) against COVID-19. This repeat vaccination in the autumn round is available to everyone aged 12 years and older who has at least completed the basic series of COVID-19 vaccinations. The vaccination is available from 3 months after the most recent COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection. "}
