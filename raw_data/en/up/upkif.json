With a blood chemistry analysis as its starting point, the focus is on treating the whole system, not just the symptoms. Interest in functional medicine has surged as our society continues to see increases in the number of people who suffer from complex, chronic diseases. These include conditions such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis. Functional Medicine: A Different Approach Unlike mainstream allopathic medicine, functional medicine views the body as an integrated system\u2014rather than a collection of independent organs divided up by medical specialties. It focuses on interactions between the environment and the gastrointestinal, immune, and endocrine systems. The allopathic approach to medicine relies heavily on isolating symptoms and using pharmacological agents (drugs) to treat the individual symptoms. This approach lacks the proper methodology for preventing and treating complex, chronic conditions. It often fails to consider the individual patient's unique genetic makeup or the exposure he or she may have to toxins and chemicals in modern society that impact our health. How Dr. McSweeney Uses Blood Chemistry Analysis The basic tool of functional medicine is blood chemistry analysis. This science involves a thorough analysis of the molecules circulating in your bloodstream. By analyzing your blood lab report, Dr. McSweeney may be able to identify potentially life-threatening conditions and diseases before they become problematic. That information, along with the principles of functional medicine, can help Dr. McSweeney identify nutritional deficiencies and correct imbalances. What Happens When You Submit a Blood Panel? Once you have submitted a special blood panel ordered by Dr. McSweeney, she will review the test results. Healthy peoples' test results fall within fairly narrow ranges. Significant deviation from the optimum range may indicate a variety of poor health conditions. Depending on your specific results, the doctor may determine that various nutritional and homeopathic products are appropriate for your individual needs. The goals for conducting the analysis and implementing this nutritional program include the following: - Return your body to its natural healthy state. - Provide early detection of developing life-threatening health conditions. - Avoid spending money on products that you may not need. - Inexpensively track the results of your nutritional program. Follow-up blood tests will allow you to chart the effectiveness of your program and make precise adjustments when needed. By leveling your blood chemistry values within the optimum ranges, your immune system will function better. In addition, you will process and absorb nutrients more efficiently and enjoy a more vibrant state of health! Getting Your Blood Chemistry Analysis If the idea of functional medicine makes sense to you, you may want to have your own blood chemistry analysis done. Discuss the issue with Dr. McSweeney, who will review the types of blood panels and associated fees. She will also refer you to one of the conveniently located labs where your blood can be drawn for the analysis.
