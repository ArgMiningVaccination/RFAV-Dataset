It is a chemical-free, natural alternative for health maintenance. When redesigning the jar label, I also designed an outer packaging for the product to protect it from damage. I chose recycled, slightly glossy, textured paper. A viewing window on the front of the box makes the color and texture of the product visible from the front, even when placed on a shelf. The shape of the tree canopy in the logo I designed makes a different twist on the packaging of each flavor variation to create a shape that reminds us of a fruit. The same shape leaps into three dimensions and reappears through the viewing window on the jar's label. Inside the fruit symbol on the bottle's front label, a viewing window opens to represent the seed of the fruit. Together, the locking tag and the shape of the canopy on the cap represent the fruit tree symbol. "}
