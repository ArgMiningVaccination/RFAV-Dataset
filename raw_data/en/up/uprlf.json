This therapy focuses on the structures of the body, especially the spine. Chiropractors usually manipulate the body's alignment to relieve pain, improve function and help the body heal itself. The main focus of chiropractic therapy is spinal manipulation, it also includes other treatments like manipulative therapies, postural exercises, ergonomic training, and patient education. Chiropractors can treat pain anywhere in the body such as the head and jaws, shoulders, elbows and wrists, hips, pelvis, knees, and ankles. This method is primarily used as a pain relief alternative for muscles, cartilages, ligaments, tendons, joints, and bones. Chiropractic therapy is also sometimes used in conjunction with conventional medical treatment. Chiropractic therapy usually involves the treatment through the following methods: Spinal Manipulation and Manual Manipulation: This type of technique involves high velocity, short lever arm thrust that is applied to the abnormal parts of the body to improve functionality, reduce nerve irritability, and restore range of motion. Chiropractic therapy is also commonly known as Chiropractic Adjustment. Mobilization: It involves low-velocity manipulation, movement, and stretching of the muscles and joints, to increase the range of motion within the affected area. The chiropractor goes through the medical history and examines the individual physically. He might also ask a few questions and might go through other lab tests such as X-rays and more. After all the investigations the chiropractor determines if an individual should undergo chiropractic therapy. During the treatment session, one or more adjustments might be done. Adjustments are also called manipulations. The therapy is done manually, i.e. by hand. The adjustments are done to increase the range of motion and to improve the quality of the area being treated. Apart from manipulation, chiropractors may use other treatments such as mobilization, massage, modalities like ice therapy, heat therapy, and electric stimulation.
