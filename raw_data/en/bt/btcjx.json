The five- to 13-night personalised programmes focus on optimising the body's natural detoxification processes after the indulgent festive period. Coupled with a visiting practitioner programme covering a range of practices, including Metta Healing and neuromuscular therapy to help eliminate toxins, January at Chiva-Som is an opportunity to revitalise and embrace the year ahead with renewed energy and mental clarity. While the body naturally flushes out toxins, the increasingly fast-paced, over-stimulated lives most of us lead makes it more difficult for the body to maintain balance. The Art of Detox retreat at Chiva-Som gives guests the tools to refresh the digestive system leading to newfound energy, improved digestion, weight loss, boosted immunity, clearer skin and a calmer mind. Led by an expert team, the Art of Detox retreat is designed to educate and support guests in discovering their ideal diet. Balancing macro and micronutrients, along with herbal and nutritional supplements, brings the digestive and metabolic systems back to their optimal function to cleanse the body of toxins. A programme of gentle treatments such as Lymphatic Drainage and Colonic Hydrotherapy, and holistic wellness practices including Pranayama breathing, stretching, and detoxifying balneotherapy, are also included to soothe and rejuvenate the body and to restore mental clarity. Chiva-Som's Holistic Manager, Ms. Pilailuk Thongtan, says: \"While detox diets are a popular way to recalibrate the body and get back on track physically, as part of Chiva-Som's holistic wellness approach, we recommend doing the same for your mind. A 'mental cleanse' can be a great way to find more balance, focus and fulfilment in our personal and spiritual relationships, and help us to feel more present and whole. It's about taking a break from the day-to-day stressors, anxieties, and distractions, whether it's practicing deep breathing and stretching exercises or reducing screen time on electronic devices\".
