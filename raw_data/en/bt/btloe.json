In some of the most ancient texts found in medicine, such as in Ayurveda and Chinese Medicine, the rose had a prominent presence in a variety of formulations. Particularly those around relieving the heart, depression, anxiety, psycho-spiritual related imbalances, and many more. According to Ayurveda, rose primarily balances s'adhaka pitta', the subdosha of pitta that governs the emotions and how it impacts the heart. It also allows for better communication between 'sadhaka pitta' and 'prana vata,' the subdosha of vata that governs the mind, breath, respiratory channels, lungs and throat. Rose is known in Ayurveda to soothe the heart and emotions and can assist in healing from past griefs so that one can move on and enjoy the present moment. Rose has cooling and astringing health benefits, and in moderation it's ideal for all three doshas - vata, pitta and kapha. It is especially beneficial during the hot summer months for those that tend to get 'pitta' (fiery) imbalance, however, can be used throughout the year to balance sadhaka pitta. In addition, there are medicinal properties of rose that have positive effects on bhrajaka pitta, the subdosha of pitta that governs the skin. Thankfully for its astringent qualities, it's actually known to tighten and make the skin supple (yes please!). It has a cooling effect on the blood which can help prevent skin issues such as acne and rashes. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), roses are plants that belong to the 'Herbs that regulate Qi' category. Qi in very simple terms is 'energy,' and within the general term of Qi there are many forms, which essentially is the vital energy that pulsates through our body. Herbs in this category typically treat a TCM condition called 'Qi Stagnation'. Concretely, it means that Qi is blocked in the body's Organs and Meridians (pathways within our body's electromagnetic field), most typically the Stomach, Liver, and to a lesser degree, the Lungs. In modern medicine terms, Qi Stagnation often translates into psychological consequences such as depression, irritability, impatience or mood swings. It's also frequently associated with conditions such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS), menopausal symptoms, the development of breast swellings as well as cooling in nature. This means that rose flowers tend to help people who have too much \"heat\" or inflammation in the body. Rose is both Bitter and Sweet. The so-called \"five elements\" theory in Chinese Medicine states that the taste of TCM ingredients is a key determinant of their action in the body. Bitter ingredients like rose flowers tend to have a cleansing action on the body by clearing heat, drying dampness and promoting elimination via kidneys/urination or bowel movements. On the other hand, sweet ingredients tend to slow down acute reactions and detoxify the body. They also have a tonic effect because they replenish Qi and Blood.The tastes of ingredients within TCM and other traditions determine what organs and meridians they target. As such roses are thought to target the Spleen and the Liver primarily, as well as the Heart. In TCM, the Spleen assists with digestion, blood coagulation and fluid metabolism in the body. The [Liver](https://animamundiherbals.com/blogs/news/digestive-intelligence-a-complete-guide-to-detoxing-the-liver-the-mind)on the other hand is often referred to as the body's \"general\" because it's in-charge of regulating the movements of Qi and body fluids. It also takes a leading role in balancing our emotions.
