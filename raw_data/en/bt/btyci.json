At the elementary and lonely. The teacher may want to mention that sometimes other people will try to get us to follow their bad behaviors. With older elementary students, emphasize that being balanced in our own lives will help us avoid following other people when they try to convince us to make bad decisions. Sometimes other people may want us to try things such as taking drugs, drinking alcohol, or doing something that is not in our best interest. If we are balanced in our lives and keep our mental and emotional health strong, then we will be bold enough not to follow these negative behaviors 6. Gi ve students time to discuss the medicine wheel on the handout. Share with students that sometimes tribes share similar traditions such as the medicine wheel. However, it is important to know that each tribe is an independent nation and will have a native language and unique customs. Note* While this is a general example of a medicine wheel, each tribe will associate different colors, resources, or meaning. Not all tribes follow a medicine wheel but will instead have other practices for wellness. Discuss the idea that balance occurs in the center of the wheel when all four aspects are in a discussion on what it might look like or feel like if a person is out of balance in each of the four areas. Sometimes students at this age have already heard parents or older siblings talk about stress, anxiety, or even depression. Many students come to class with the effects of trauma already present in their lives.

Procedure (continued)5 Good Medicine Bundle | Finding Balance in Traditional WaysShodajee (Show-daw-jay)! Hello students, greetings from Bozeman, Montana. Bozeman is in a large valley surrounded by tall mountains, and is the traditional homeland of many indigenous nations, including my own Aps\u00e1alooke (Up-saw-low-gah) Nation. Along with sharing a vast and beautiful homeland with other nations like the Blackfeet, Salish and Shoshone to name a few, my tribe also shares many common values and similar traditions that celebrate a balanced life. \"Medicine Wheels\" are a representative symbol of those values, and there is much wisdom in their simple and perfect equality. In this lesson, you will learn about we can all use the Medicine Wheel to help guide us through our day and avoid the pitfalls of addiction and the harms that come from it. The Aps\u00e1alooke and other Indigenous people believe strongly in a ceremonial way of life that emphasizes the importance of discipline, humility, and prayer each day. There is also an understanding among Native people that medicine is more than something that comes in the form of a pill or shot from doctors at the hospital or pharmacy. In the Aps\u00e1alooke language, the word for sacred medicine is \"baxpa\", pronounced bawk-paw, and it is believed that each of us can receive the blessings of sacred medicine if we practice a balanced life and do good things for ourselves and others. This is the reason the stone circles are called \"Medicine Wheels\", because they remind us how we can heal from pain and trauma and become whole. Some of the Medicine Wheels, like the one in the photograph below, are over 6,000 years old, and from these wheels came the Sun Dance ceremony, which is also pictured. This ceremony is shared in some form by all the tribes of the Northern Plains and is meant to heal the mind and body and the community. It without food or water while dancing and praying for as many as 3 days and nights. Family and friends come together to support the ceremony, sharing food and exchanging gifts at the conclusion, and there is a powerful feeling of connection, respect and sacredness. This is the spiritual medicine that helps us to heal and also to understand how making negative decisions such as taking drugs like opiods or hurting other people takes us away from the circle of balance and health and wellness. I am very thankful and proud of the beautiful traditions that have been passed down from my ancestors. The ceremonies and knowledge that have guided me in my life have protected me from addiction and given me the tools and ability to live my best life.

Discovery Education, Inc.6 Why is Balance Important? Student Handout 2 REFLECTIONAll of us value our well-being and enjoy feeling good about our lives and what we do. Our brains have ways to reward us with pleasure when we live a balanced and disciplined life. One of the ways we experience a feeling of pleasure is when we celebrate our friendship with others. When we are generous and show gratitude and respect toward our friends and loved ones, our brains release chemical messengers like dopamine and serotonin that provide us with a signal that we are on a good path. These chemicals help our bodies in many ways and make us healthier. If people experience traumas or challenges, they may not feel they can make positive choices or have positive thoughts that help release these good chemicals. Sometimes people try other things like opioids, medications, or alcohol to try to feel better. When people become addicted to opioids, they are no longer in balance, and they need the drugs to feel normal and good. Medicine Wheel also provides a model for people who become addicted to opioids to regain their health and wellness by following the path of balance and discipline. This means learning how to activate the happy chemicals in our brain to feel more authentic feelings rather than the false feelings of happiness that drugs and medicines may give the body. The Medicine Wheel is divided into four parts which Native peoples see as the balance of nature. Traditional knowledge relied on what could be learned through a deep connection with the natural world. The use of How can our knowledge about the medicine wheel help us think about working on a healthy balance in our own lives? Are there any parts of the medicine wheel that you feel could be out of balance for you?

Celebrating and cherishing spirituality is an important value for Native people, and being outside with nature, along with periodic fasting, is a key tradition. Maintaining faith in ourselves and in our neighbors helps Native people to overcome personal and community challenges. Disciplining our bodies to be healthy is an ancient Native American tradition on the Northern Plains.

These tribes all use the historic Medicine Wheel for religious purposes. When Indigenous religious practice was outlawed in the 19th century, these tribes were forbidden to visit the sacred Medicine Wheel (punishment included time in federal prison). Medicine Wheel was not reopened to tribal ceremonial use until the 1950s (Geist). While lands surrounding the Medicine Wheel are now reserved for Indigenous people's religious use, the struggle leading up to this decision was far from simple. The origin of this Medicine Wheel is a mystery, though archaeological evidence shows that Native American tribes have used the area for 7,000 years (Manataka American Indian Council). The 23,000-acre area surrounding the medicine wheel holds approximately 44 historic sites including \"tipi rings, lithic scatters, buried archeological sites, and a system of relict prehistoric Indian trails\" (Chapman to this site to seek visions and offer prayer. Almost every Indigenous tribe uses a Medicine Wheel, though most traditions differ slightly. For the Lakota tribe, the center of the wheel is the \"heart.\" This is the place where the people give back to Mother Earth (Kaelin, Celinda; teaching; January 27, 2011). During buffalo hunts the Lakota people would place the tongue of the buffalo, the most important part, under the rock to show their appreciation to Mother Earth, the Creator (Kaelin, Celinda; teaching; January 27, 2011). In ceremonies today, they place the sacred tobacco that is smoked in pipe ceremony under the \"heart\" stone (Kaelin, Celinda; teaching; January 27, 2011).

In fact, the Secretary of the Interior declared it a National Historic Landmark in 1970 (MAIC). In 1988, the Forest Service attempted to build a viewing platform, parking lot, and visitor center near the Medicine Wheel. However, this was appealed by two Native American organizations that joined together with an environmental and historical group to prevent the action (MAIC). Instead, they had the land recognized as a religious site. In 1996, several Wyoming organizations signed a Programmatic Agreement employing a Historic Preservation Plan (HPP), which encompassed all of Medicine Mountain, an 18,000-acre area. This gave unlimited ceremonial use to Native Americans and privacy for these he First Amendment (Chapman). Judges ruled that they had no standing to challenge the HPP. The Forest Service suspended a timber sale with Wyoming Sawmills of Sheridan because the noise would have disrupted the ceremonies held at Medicine Wheel. A Cheyenne cultural leader explains, \"The tribes traditionally went and still go to the sacred mountain. The people sought the high mountain for prayer\" (Gulliford). Many different native tribes still use the Medicine Wheel in Wyoming to seek visions, make prayer offerings, fast, conduct the Sun Dance ceremony, and seek and native groups have worked to protect. While controversy still surrounds the Bighorn Medicine Wheel on Medicine Mountain, as of right now, the HPP still stands. Although tourists still sometimes have access to the Medicine Wheel, access is restricted, and when requested by the Native Americans, access is denied to tourists during "}
