ISBN 0009-3890 Printed in England by Image Illustration Ltd.Editorial When children draw, they somehow succeed in making nature seem 'larger than life'. The Sri Lankan tree placatorsees and feels nature larger than hfe. Breughel's peasants dance nature, as it were, larger than life. But what has happened to the rest of us? Why do we see, feel, draw, dissect and 'manage' nature as if it were a conglomeration of particles, less than life? Where will it end if, despite the modern ecologist's efforts to impress the message upon us,we still continue to treat the soil, the air, water, solar energy, the plant, the animal and the human being - life itself, in fact - as if it and they were all less than life? How can we bring new life to ourthinking, the main trend of which, over the last four centuries, has made the world into this corpse? What part can education play in all this? An Edinburgh chambermaid of a hundred years ago calling her warning: 'Gardy loo', was obviously unaware of the ecological signicance of her deed, if it ever got as far as having any! By contrast, the youths of yesterday \u2014 some of them now spooning honey into their herb tea during b r e a k i n Wa l d o r f S c h o o l s t a f f r o o m s \u2014 had probably been thoroughly exposed to the immediacy of polluted air, disturb ing noise levels and disappearing fossil fuels well before ever putting insteps to kick-starters, revving up for the rst time and hacking off on their machines. No doubt we could all tighten ourecological belts! B u t h o w f a r d o e s m e r e e x p o s u r e really touch us? Awareness of ecological consequences is undoubtedly on the increase. It has, however, a tumour of ecologically destructive practice to deal with, a tumour that has been growing morbidly for decades. Even where a keen-edged scalpel may discover the growth, many resources, much ingenuity, painstaking research and dedicated labour will be needed if post-operative measures are going to restore the lost balance of nature. A wide variety of attitudes towards restoring this balance obtains: There is the Cornish small-holder 'practising her survival skills'; or the hob-nailed old timer getting away, from it all, leaving his car harmlessly conned to garage, as he tramps through carpets of the Grass of Parnassus high above Loch Lomond; there are the big commercial enterprises decking out their city blocks withimpressive displays of window boxes and flower tubs;or the company pubUsh- ing tastefully illustrated pamphlets to heighten young people's awareness of rare and vanishing species; and there was Rainbow's proposal for a Waldorf com munity \u2014 did anyone answer his letter in the last issue of Child and Man? And many more attitudes could be mentioned. All play their part, though few have weight only on the plus side of the scale pan. One of the most beautiful and natural of sights is to see a small child picking flowers. This can, of course, elicit one response if they are daisies being gathered on the lawn for a daisy chain and another, very different, if they are the majority of Daddy's crop of prize carnations. Never theless, through the vase of summer flowers which the child has arranged on the kitchen table, he seems to be saying: I, too, am gathering cosmic blossoms, and I seek a vessel in which they can live on, to give joy to all the connections Iwill make in the household of my hfe. All the more painful is it for the youth- who longs, deep in his heart, for nature to speak again - to become aware on the one hand of how the form of Man crowns earthly creation, whereas, on the other, much of his behaviour sullies it. Here, as in other walks of life, there are pain-killers on offer. Often one experiences how the seeming advantages to the individual of cut-prices, labour- saving devices, creature-comforts, in surance cushions of all shapes and sizes, or lucrative investments mask the eco logical disadvantages to the earth as a whole. These remain in the background. And youth can be defencelessly suscep tible when the world presents itself through such facades. Although the Ecology Party did not o f f e r M r s . T h a t c h e r m u c h p o l i t i c a l opposition at the general election last summer, in the depths of people's con sciousness there is a stirring not limited by political leanings and afliations, national frontiers or particular creeds. In one recent edition only of a British national daily, within the scope of some seven pages, a large number of news items was published having some bearing on the wider aspects of ecology: The strong influence of pubhc reaction upon t h e s t r a w b u r n i n g p o l i c y o f o n e o f Britain's larger cereal growers (front page). Among the Greenham Common prosecuted, one woman of 26 years ofage who was quoted as saying: \"We may be legally guilty, but not morally guilty.\" The 80ft. high Orkney windmill has now been constructed to produce 250 kilo watts for the national grid. The Greater London Council's proposal to ban heavylorries within its boundary at night and at weekends \"to curb noise, dirt, and danger\". Two gardening articles. Dr. Michael Colgan's Californian based re search (formerly New Zealand) into re formed prison diet: by reducing rened carbohydrates and sugars, he claims tocorrect high blood sugar levels m pnson- ers as well as deciencies in vitamins and minerals - less violence where governors have followed his advice, he attributes to the diet. A report of discussion at the British Veterinary Association Congress concerning the regularisation of animal experiments (though gures are still high, there has been a 23.6% decrease since 1976). Even mention of six African pygmy geese introduced into Sir Peter Scott's Slimbridge Wild Fowl Trust - a rare species from Zimbabwe! In society at large, clearly the climate of opinion seems already to be changing. This can only serve to strengthen much i n t h e W a l d o r f c u r r i c u l u m w h i c h e m braces ecological concerns. It is to be hoped that the present issue of Child a n d M a n , i n b e i n g d e v o t e d t o s u c h matters, will add to this strength. In it, glimpses may be obtained of several ways in which the child's connection with nature is furthered at all levels in a Waldorf School, from Kindergarten to university entrance candidates. There are also descriptions of current research being conducted by sister movements, research w h i c h a l s o h a s i t s c o n n e c t i o n s w i t h Waldorf Education both in the present and looking forwards towards the future. B.M. 23Comment Exploitation and Nourishment The battle between those who exploit t h e e a r t h a n d t h o s e w h o c a r e f o r i t i s becoming more visible. In this last year, public outrage forced the U.S. Administration to strengthen the Environmental Protection Agency. Independent organizations that work to protect the environment, such as the Sierra Club and the Audubon Society, are growing stronger. An organization that has recently been formed in New York, Universal Children's Gardens, is calling for whole-earth gardens in every city of the world, in which children can learn to make compost, use tools, care for plants and vegetables and enjoy s e a s o n a l c e l e b r a t i o n s . Another encouraging initiative is taking place in the State Parks of Northern California, where.State Historian Glen Burch is guiding Environmental Living Programs for children. In places with rich historical associations, teachers, parents, children and the Park Ranger re-create the lives of. for example, Miwok Indians, early settlers, or even Russian soldiers. The aim is to share a dramatic experience that awakens under standing for other ways of life and other relationships with nature. Uniting History, Drama, Science, Cooking, Sociology, Crafts and an Ecology thatplaces the human being in the centre of the picture, these courses are greatly appreciated. The same life and death battle that we see taking place around us is, of course, taking place within us. Just as the earth is exploited, usually for short term gain, we exploit our own bodies. More than twenty years ago, Jacques Lusseyran warned that, although environmentalconcern was clearly important, the realdanger, which we never heard about, was the pollution of the human \"I\". If our whole life is concerned with externals, we lose touch with our inner being, the source of humanity and of our ability to cope with adversity. Lusseyran described how. soon after entering a Nazi prison camp where clothes were taken and hair shaved off, he spoke with many people who felt that in this way their whole identity had been taken from them. Witliin a few weeks they had died. How well would any of us stand up to such an experience today? How well, in fact, are we standing up to the pressures external and internal which beset, 1 suspect, just about everyone? In amongst the murders and suicides there is, 1 think, quite a lot of good news. There is a rising tide of people who recognise that we are now so interdepen dent, that every little thing we do or omit to do has repercussions throughout the whole human community. There is growing awareness that natural science is bringing more moral problems that present us with powerful challenges. And, there is a dawning comprehension that education is a disaster when presided over by governments. More money is not the answer: a recent U.S. survey revealed that many independent schools are providing good learning environments with less funds than their neighboring state school. In Waldorf education, we are clear that education belongs rmly in the hands ofteachers and parents. Good education is creative in meeting the needs of each individual within each particular environ ment and gets polluted by bureaucratic b o o k s o f r u l e s . Like the health of the world, or the health of an individual, good education can not be standardised but requires to be nurtured by a living stream of indivi dual initiatives. D.J.B.Second on the Third Wor / / . The Rural Development Programme at Emerson College b y M AT T H I A S G U E P I N Sketches drawn on site by 17yeaf,.oids. I t i s w e l l o v e r 1 0 0 y e a r s n o w T s m c e ^ ' ^ n ^ ing and market-gardening started becom ing an industry. Human labour anddraught animal labour has, in what we call the \"developed world\", been replaced by machinery, thus taking the heavy labour out of agriculture. Farming and gardening has become a profession instead of a \"way of life\". The goal is to achieve the same working hours as in industry, and all extra hours to be paid accordingly. Nobody can be against it. It is not fair if those whose task it is to provide food work from sunrise to sunset, and those who provide the rest of our basic needs work only part of the day. Industry and agriculture basically have the same rights. No doubt the goal was right, but now we have run into trouble. What happened? As soon as the farmer/gardener recog nized the blessing of shorter working days and a somewhat easier life, he or she more or less stepped out of the natural day andseasonaTrhytlimsTfbrcing the farm/garden into a new rhytlim \u2014 the rhytlim of the machine. Wheels need a dry soil, but h o o v e s a n d f e e t c a n d e a l w i t h a m o i s t soil. The draught horse or ox could drag the harrow over a eld at exactly the right sowing time, while the tractor wheel would still slip and smear because the moist earth was still too heavy. The challenge, however, to bring back the e l d w o r k f r o m o n e h o u r p e r a c r e , dragging the harrow by horse, to less than half an hour by tractor, changed t h e f a r m e r ' s m i n d a n d m a d e h i m a n agronomist. A half year's pay became a monthly pay, then a weekly pay, then an hourly pay. A new rhythm started rulingthe countryside, a rhythm of how much a man or woman can do in an hour, not with his or her skills, but as an operator of a lifeless machine. It resulted in a full dependence on the machine, the situation we are in now. 45iP ,y -^1? .0:E In agriculture it is almost unthinkable \u2014 a n d w e d o n o t w a n t t o t h i n k a b o u t i t - about what will happen if fuel is suddenly not there any more. The unemployed masses in their turn cannot see themselves labouring in the elds. With our hands on the steering wheel of a car or tractor w e h e a r w h a t t h e r a d i o t e l l s u s a b o u t droughts, floods, famine and over production. But we do not understand that it is the result of the new rhythm ruling our lives. The changing weather and the mass migration to the cities is due to the fact that the natural rhythm of the countryman has been lost and making a living on the land has become extremely difcult, although the living space and food is there all right. The ecological disasters are coming closer. We see the dead elm trees all over the countryside; our lakes are dying; theLondon authorities warn that no vege tables grown in the gardens of the G r e a t e r L o n d o n a r e a c a n b e e a t e nbecause of our own car pollution. But we keep on driving our cars anyway! Crippled leaders While going through this process, which is basically a struggle in the realm of consciousness, our \"developed world'' feels at the same time very concerned about what is going on in the \"under developed\" part of the world. We feel that we cannot let people die because of lack of food. As we are still wealthy people, we are willing to help them to achieve a better way of life. Numerous are the aid organizations, and large sums are spent on food-aid and rural develop- ment. We send water pumps, grain mills, tools and equipment to make life easier.Out of our good hearts we want to share a better life with them. Not long ago, the D u t c h m i n i s t e r o f \" D e v e l o p m e n t C o operation\" stated, after having been in a country where logging by axe was still common, that he would send chain-saws to take the heavy labour out of tree felling! How can we get away from wanting to share our disasters with them? Is it not like the drug addict who wants to share his experience with one who has not had it yet? A crippled way of sharing a crippled social task? Wherever we go, we always meet the urge in developing countries to gain the same wealth as the West. The way we live will be the way they live. Our develop ment is theirs. The only difference is that oiir industry took an age or more to develop. Theirs is a sudden one. For instance, the introduction of articialfertilizers in many developing countriesstarted only 20 years ago, putting a sudden stop to traditional agriculture which was based on family and village food production. Today the larger majority of small farmers in the tropics are cash crop farmers, who sell one or two crops to the merchants and buy food with the cash. As the growing of cash crops such as tomatoes, coffee,tobacco etc., needs plenty of fertilizer and pesticides, the \"input\" is high. The merchant who buys the crop, however, makes sure that the price is low. This forces the farmer to buy cheap foodwhich ruins the health of the family. Malnutrition becomes a common picture in many countries which originally had a sound agriculture. Development begins at home Out of the question: how can we develop ourselves so that we can help others in their development, a course at Emerson College came into being called The Rural Development Programme. It in tends to be a study and training course for men and women who want to work in rural areas in developing countries. Thefounder of this course, Mark Feedman, who worked for many years as a rural development worker in the Carribean, r e c o g n i z e d t h e p o s s i b i l i t i e s o f b i o - dynamic agriculture when he studied it at Emerson College in 1978-79. During his work in Honduras, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic, he experienced the hopeless situation of the peasant farmers in those countries and saw howlittle effect today's aid programs have when they work out of our western way of thinking. People wanting to go out should have a thorough knowledge and skill in small-scale agriculture, based on the ecological situation in the area and think in terms of self-subsistence, as so much of this principle has been lost. Out of self-subsistence, a way of agriculture can develop which will feed the cities,as gradually, through bio-dynamic agri culture, the soil will improve and become fertile again. Then food surpluses develop and the small farmer will become the one who can sell natural and balanced foods to the cities as he has always done in the past. Developing skills by the use of one's hands forms a large part of the three-year training course. The development of a ve acre mixed smali-holding by the students, helps them to gain condence in their own personality. Many aspects of gardening\u2014herb growing, tree nursery,vegetable gardening, fruits, flowers etc. \u2014 are dealt with, and eld crops, animal husbandry, and the construction of their housing, form the farm part of the place. The necessary theoretical background is 6 7given by the staff of the faculty for bio- dynamics at the college. The studentgains his tropical experience at the Pro gramme's eld-station in the Dominican Republic, where Mark Feedman and his wif^e. Chela Lightchild, train local peasants in ecologically orientated agri culture. Step by step, they make them familiar with the basics of bio-dynamics. But there is a long way to go as their agriculture is still based on slash-and-bum principles. The students learn to com municate and work together with the Spanish-speaking Dominicans who are of African origin. To work at the same level as the local people and not as someone wanting to introduce something new from the developed world is not an easy task \u2014 as what we would like to share with them does come from the West! Mark Feedman therefore underlines that something like a bio-dynamic approach to rural develop ment is what is actually needed. Not the bio-dynamic method itself. It needs to be developed out of people. The same s e e m s r e l e v a n t f o r W a l d o r f e d u c a t i o n which also never can be an export article. Dominicans therefore, will have to deve lop their own bio-dynamic method. The task of the development worker can only be to do the work together with the local people and show that it works on their elds and in their gardens with theirtools and seeds. A sustainable agriculture which functions as a part of nature, even supporting nature, is the aim. However, not the only one. The work on the land will naturally be followed up by a re quest to teach the children. First a school garden, then classes about nature, and soon a full programme. Mark Feedman was asked several times to start a school when he described the Waldorf approach to education. Agriculture will have anatural follow-up by education, crafts, etc. It only needs the people who decide to skill themselves by working with their hands. The half-year stay at the Dominican e l d s t a t i o n e n a b l e s t h e s t u d e n t t o s e ewhat is realistic and what is not. They come back with a good deal of under standing. Nobody expects them to stay in remote rural areas for the rest of their lives. They will come back and train other people who want to go out. People who have that inner urge of wanting to be of service. Not out of sentimentality, but out of a feeling that it is not too lateto help people to survive, and at the same time, build bridges between nations and hopefully contribute to the task we all share in learning to work out of the Spirit. Having graduated at Agricultural College in Holland in 1950. Matthias Guepin turned his hand to this present work after experiences of severe soil and water erosion when farming in Argentina. L.Ecology A Living Experience The Harlemville Rudolf Steiner Farm School by NANCY DILL Early in the year of 1970, the environ mental movement burst into national a w a r e n e s s w i t h E a r t h We e k . D e m o n s t r a tions, speeches, books, and articles challenged the nation and the world to awaken to what is described by many as the greatest crisis yet faced by mankind. Charges and counter charges were ex changed between those who saw theurgent need for a new environmental e t h i c a n d t h e i n d u s t r i a l w o r l d w h i c h f e a r e d f o r i t s e x i s t e n c e . I n t i m e t h e c l a m o r a n d e x c i t e m e n t s u b s i d e d a n d many returned to a complacent faith in an ever-growing Gross National Product which would provide \"the good life\" for all. Many engineers and scientists saw solutions in more science and more technology, but many people also joined t h e r a n k s o f e n v i r o n m e n t a l i s t s i n t h e i r efforts to awaken public consciousness to the havoc and destruction our careless way of life is having on the sustaining power of this earth. Enlightened educators were stimulated to press for environmental education in the schools - the study of ecology \u2014 in the hopes that through education of the young, enlightenment of all could be accomplished. Many states have, in fact, mandated the study of ecology at all grade levels, and millions of dollars have been spent on programs and personnel. Still, except for an occasional shock or outrage over a Three-Mile-Island incidentor a massive oil spill or the effects of acid rain, much of the world remains ignorant or frustrated about what to do or what, even, can be done to meet the crisis and affect a change. Why is it that in the more than ten years since Earth Week the educational inoculation has not succeed ed in getting to the real heart of the problem? Why do the naturalists, environmental educators, writers and planners face such difculties in getting the message across, even to the impressionable minds of the young? What is the missing ingredient we seek, the key which will open the eyes and minds of the world to a new attitude, a new ethic so essential for the task which lies before us? Also in that year, 1970, Dr. Franz Winkler at the opening of a seminar held at the Myrin Institute on \"The Quality of Life on Earth\" said the following, \"Youth longs for nature, but almost nothing in school experience or in modem life brings students in touch with nature's beauties and mysteries. School is abstract, the civilization is mechanical, the environ ment surfaced with concrete; nowhere does living nature come through...\" \"The love of nature springs from an intuitive relationship between man and the earth, the sky, and the living creatures of his environment; but life today works against intuition.\"^ ^Dr. Franz Winkler, \"The Secret of Peace and the Environmental Crisis\". Proceedings, (TheMyron Institute, Inc., Spring 1971). 89Ecology polluted by academicalism earth underfoot or planted seeds or held Is it possible that in these words of a warm egg fresh from the nest or felt the Dr. Winkler, we can nd the key for which cow's warmth in the barn on a frosty we search?

Very young children have not lived long enough to be tainted b y t h e p a r t i c u l a r p r e j u d i c e s o f t h e Twentieth Century. Instead of trying to deprive them of the wonders of that fuller, magical experience to which early childhood still has access, grown-ups might practice opening their minds and eyes to a view of reality everywhere ensouled, as a child does, and be innitely enriched thereby. They might in conse quence even nd themselves one day adventuring with their children into that k i n g d o m r i g h t l y c a l l e d T h e L a n d o f Heart's Desire, the habitat of faeries. Those who listened with open hearts a n d m i n d s t o R u d o l f S t e i n e r h a d a c h a n c e to learn a great deal about the faeries and the work they do. He took them very seriously indeed, for he saw in them beings of profound importance, charged not only with the day-to-day maintenance of Nature's household but with the carry ing out of her evolutionary plans as well. Nature People of earlier ages knew a tiling or two we have forgotten. They saw and worshipped Nature as a goddess. To them the living world was faery country, wheredwelt an innitude of lesser spirits over whom she reigned. Natural events were regarded as their acts, performed in her service. And from every tree and plant and cloud, mountain, spring and flower these beings spoke with a voice to which the people hearkened. For wisdom is the breath of life in Nature, the exhalation of the goddess, and it was this wisdom that they sought in listening. So it was from the Little People that men of earlier times learned such things as the secrets of the healing powers of plants, the properties of metals, the care of elds and flocks and children. U n d e r s u c h c i r c u m s t a n c e s m a n a n d Nature were one heart and soul, and faeries the mouthpiece through which they communicated. F o u r r a c e s o f L i t t l e P e o p l e f o r m Nature's work-force. It is their function to convey life tlirough the realms of Nature, serving the four elements: earth, air, re and water. Gnomes are the care takers of the earth-realm. Undines or water-spirits are wielders of fluids. Sylphs rule the element of air and liglit. Fire-spirits reign over processes of heat. G n o m e s a n d U n d i n e s G n o m e s l i v e d o w n b e l o w t h e s u r f a c e o f our planet, where roots take an anchor- h o l d o n e a r t h . T h e r e c o u l d b e n o s u c h tilings as plant or tree roots if there were no gnomes to tend their development.Gnomes are at work throughout the year marshalling mineral nutrients around them and wielding magnetic forces to draw them down to a rm grounding in the earth. These Little People are immensely clever; they are the knowers among elementals. They have large heads out of all proportion to their tiny bodies. Faery tales tell how they carry little lamps ontheir subterranean wanderings. But the light cast comes from their own bright intelligence. They have what we might call \"a knowing eye\"; they understand everything at a glance, or just by sticking their long noses into it. To them, anyone who has to think to get facts is half asleep. They consider thinking just a means of pulling oneself together from a bout ofdreaming. Since they are wide awake already, they perceive what is without having to mull it over in their heads. These little beings, from tip to toe one tingling sensor, have as their own specialfaeryland the realm of metals and ofRoot Spirits crystals, through which they wandertasting all manner of delight in its transit. Mortals see that realm only as a nished world, still, hard and unchanging. But to gnomes' subtle sensing it is all alive, a world of moving forces rather than of matter, still endowed with the music and colourfulness of its cosmic origin. If you go down where metals are being mined and wander through the galleries you will nd yourself in a swarm of gnomes. But to catch sight of the water-spirits \u2014 nixies or undines \u2014 you must go where water and air commingle. Undines are all flowing motion, streaming shapes never twice the same. And when veils of rain sweep over a landscape and mist rises to drift over hills and valleys, there you will nd these willowy dream ers playing in the metamorphosis of form, trailing about in shifting cloud- masses. But undines too have a task assigned them. It is they who draw sap, the clear lifeblood of vegetation, up the trunks of 1213Tree Elemental. trees and stems of plants to join forces with the light in foliage. All nixies are alchemists, bringing about magical change in the shape and composition of sub stances as they wield the fluid element to bind and loosen. Sylphs and SalamandersJust as gnomes inhabit earth and undines water, sylphs \u2014 the spirits of the light and air \u2014 are dwellers in the atmosphere, darting about in the wake of birds, whose flight, to their ears, makes music on the air-waves. Sylphs live in a world of tone, a realm of sounding glitter so vivid that even our dull ears and eyes catch glimpses of it. It is not for nothing that we resort to such terms as 'colour-tone' and 'tone- colouring,' showing that in some deeper level of our being we are, after all, dimly aware of the faery world behind what we mistake for reality, sensing that in a fuller experience colour can be heard and music seen.Sylphs work in closest communion with the undines, bringing the creative forces of the light-world to commingle witli the flow of sap in vegetative greening and in the taking on of blossom colour. They are, moreover, lovers and guardians of birds, in whose presence alone they experience wholeness. It is they who teach the little birds to sing. They take an invisible but vital part in bird migra tions. The next time you look up at a flock travelling northward or southward with tiie changing seasons you might try to listen in as with the sylph's ears to the multicoloured sounding of its passage. At such times the sky overhead becomes a miglity wind-harp, the air a kaleido scope of rainbow tone. Lastly, those inseparable companions of the butterfly: re-spirits, on whose wings warmth is carried into earth. They fly with every pollinating insect. And as our world was once born of re and every true idea is still begotten in the warm glow of enthusiasm, so re-spirits wield that primeval element, mothering summer's heat around the swelling fruits, sweetening, bringing them to fullness, letting us taste and smell the sun and planets in their savours. They bring seeds, those tiny clinkers of their burning, to maturity. And from their hands the dreams of next year's vegetation fall with the seed to earth for gnomes to nourish. Henceforth the underworld is warmed and lit, as our inner world is, with visions, the cherished images of tliings-to-be that fuel evolution. Living with Nature How vital to our life are faeries! Without the gnomes there would be no solid ground to stand on, no rm bones to make a scaffolding inside us, no logical s t r u c t u r e i n o u r t h i n k i n g ; w i t h o u t undines no life-giving lakes and streams and oceans to lave the dry land, no green vegetation, no circulating fluids in our bodies, no liquid world of feeling in our souls; without sylphs no movement ofair nor blessing of the light, no flowers, no purposeful wills; without re-spirits no warmth, no hearths to sit by, no fruits or fragrances or grains, no re-core of selfhood. For all this, and a great deal more, we owe the faeries thanks and recognition. It is they who keep the earth so alive that the elements, their provinces, are faithfuly out-picturings of the soul of Nature. Our whole world lives in soul and body because of the presence of the Little People in it. We live with gnomes when we enter perceptively into winter's gesture. It can be sensed as a holding in, the dynamic that solidies minerals and makes the cohesion of the frozen earth. We live with undines when we feel with spring, experiencing the upward freeing of the tide of life, letting our own beings flow in waking dream with the undulating and meandering, the surging and billow ing of the fluid element. We live with sylphs when we imagine ourselves moving with the raying light as it suffuses the whole universe in summer, striking into and illumining the outer scene as wisdom does the inner. We live with re-spirits in the mellow warmth that is carried deep into the earth in autumn, when Nature's soul again turns inward, withdrawing the life that poured forth in summer and transmuting it into energy of spirit. Immersing ourselves in this dynamic, we c o m e t o u n d e r s t a n d t h e t i e s t h a t l i n k re-spirits to the life of man, where they fan creative res and work in the generating of imaginative vision. This is to live with Nature where she really lives. Looking behind the scenes, participating more and more sensitivelyin the action, one begins to wake up to the wonders of the real world, known to children, where the Little People labour.

Teachers who practise it discover how akin such a presentation is to the life-giving nature of a young child's c r e a t i v e c o n s c i o u s n e s s . I n t h i s i s s u e w e are concerned with its application to 'nature study' (though it applies equally w e l l t o t h e i n t r o d u c t i o n o f l e t t e r s a n d writing, the learning of musical notation or to disciplinary matters). The following is an example of a so-called Nature Stoiy. Through such stories the children of Classes 1 and II are introduced to some of the natural processes in their environment. What they receive in tliis way may then flow on as an undercurrent of deeply felt interest in the natural world. Such a stream may well by joined by tributaries of wonder or reverence in a soul in which such qualities abound. Where they do not, it may well lave the thirsty land precisely with those qualities. Moreover, when it passes, in the latter part of a school career, through land scapes of more conceptual activity, of natural scientic modes of thought and of precise observation and analysis, it will have more chance of imbuing the necessary precision and exactness of the scientist with life. Ed.A 9year old's drawing. In the forest under a large nut tree sat a walnut. He hadn't always been sitting onthe ground. Once, he had lived high, high up on the very tip of one of the tallest branches with the blue sky smiling at him, the sun warming him and the wind rock ing him. The birds sang to him. He had been a very happy, little green walnut until one day something happened to make him become very afraid \u2014 and this is what it was. Early on a summer morning a black crow landed on walnut's branch and began pecking at the nut next to walnut. He pecked and pecked until he made a large hole in the nut's side. Then the crow put Iiis beak into the hole and beganeating. \"Oh!\" shuddered walnut, \"I don't want that to happen to me,\" and he pulled the two halves of his shell tightly together and tried to make him self very, very hard. From then on.day after day. he practised making him self as hard as he could. Summer passed and walnut's color began to change from green to pale brown, but indeed, he scarcely noticed this for he only thought about making his outside shell harder a n d h a r d e r . One day a dark shadow fell on walnut. Startled, he looked up - straight into the black, beady eyes of the largest crowhe had ever seen. The crow began ercely pecking at walnut's side. He pecked and pecked and pecked. Little walnut could do nothing but quiver inside and shudder and pull his shell tight. But, do you know, that no matter liow hard that crow pecked, he could not make a hole in walnut's shell. Finally, the crow gave up and flew away. How proud walnut felt. How happy he was that he had practised becoming hard during the long summer days. \"Why, i am stronger than crow!\" he exclaimed. \" 1 a m a h a r d n u t i n d e e d ! \" I t w a s n ' t long before all the nuts heard about walnut's hardness. They gazed at him respectfully and whispered to each other that he must be the hardest nut on the whole tree. Walnut puffed his chest out with pride and kept on practising to become harder. The days went by until one afternoon with a big huff and a puff the wind came and blew walnut right off his branch. \"What's this,\" cried walnut as he felt himself falling, \"what will happen to me now?\" He kept on falling faster and faster. With a loud 'geplunk' he landed right on a large stone at the base of the tree. Walnut looked around. Scattered about the stone were bits and pieces of other walnuts that had fallen and cracked as they bounced off the stone. \"Ha!\" said walnut as he saw this. \"I've nothing to be afraid of down here. Why, I'm even stronger than tliis stone. 1 really am a tough nut to crack!\" and there he sat proudly on the forest floor. A squirrel came by collecting nutsfor his winter store. He tried to bite into walnut. \"Oucli.\" cried squirrel. \"Why. this nut is so hard it hurt my tooth.\" \"That's right.\" retorted walnut. \"I'm a h a r d n u t t o c r a c k m u c h t o o h a r d f o r you, squirrel!\" Not long after, a porcupine ambled up. \"llm,\" he thought. \"This is a nice, fat nut - just right for my dinner.\" He put walnut between his strong teeth and made a loud crunch. \"Owl\" he exclaimed, letting go of walnut. \"This nut is so hard it's given me a jawache.\" \"That's right,\" piped walnut. \"I'm a hard, iiard nut. Nobody's harder than 1 am!\" So it was with all the forest animals. They took turns trying to open walnut but he was too hard and tough for them. \"No one is going to crack me,\"die said, \" n o t e v e r ! \" A f t e r t h a t t h e c r e a t u r e s o f t h e f o r e s t l e f t w a l n u t a l o n e . T h e r e h e s a t f o r t h e rest of the autumn and the long winteruntil one day he awoke to nd that the spring rain had come. 'Splash, splash, splash' went the raindrops against his shell. Tap, tap. tap' like a quiet knocking. \"Hello, rain,\" said walnut. \"I'm wal nut, and if you haven't heard by now, I'm a hard nut to crack.\" The gentle spring rain didn't say anything but only sent another soft drop of water rolling down w a l n u t ' s c h e e k \u2014 t h e n a n o t h e r s o f t drop and then another. \"Hymph!\" con tinued walnut. \"I can see 1 have nothing to fear from you. Why, you're so soft you couldn't even crack a peanut!\" He went on, \"I've been pecked by crow but I was too strong for him. 1 fell all the way from the top of the tree onto the stone and 1 still didn't crack. Nearly all the creatures have tried to break my shell, but I'm too hard for them. The truth is I'm probably the hardest nut in this forest,\" he loudly exclaimed, swelling himself with pride so that his chest looked as if it might burst. But, therain didn't say anything. It just kept 1617falling gently, ever so gently, and soon walnut became drowsy and fell asleep. He awoke with a start to nd the rain had stopped aiid he was quite dry. He thought of tlie rain and he felt a tender stirring in his heart, and he could not help but wonder if she would come again. Then he suddenly remembered that he ought to be practising to becomeharder, and all the rest of the day he pulled his shell tight ... except now andagain he stopped and thought of the rain, and each time he felt a gentle stirring in his heart. The next day the spring rain came again. \"Hymph!\" he greeted her as the soft drops began to fall,\"er ... ah,! mean 'hello'.\" The rain didn't reply but she stayed a little longer this time, and wal nut felt the gentle stirring in his heart grow stronger and stronger. On the following day walnut didn't even feel like practising. His whole heart w a s l l e d w i t h t e n d e r n e s s . A l l h e c o u l d t h i n k a b o u t w a s t h e r a i n a n d i f s h e w o u l d come. *T wonder if she has a heart,\" he thought. \"I will ask her.\" The rain didn't come that day but she came the next. \"Do you have a heart?\" he called to her as soon as the rst drop touched his cheek. \"My heart lies hidden in the clouds,\" replied the rain. \" A h , \" s i g h e d w a l n u t , \" t h e n I m u s t somehow reach the clouds.\" He sat very quiet for a while thinking. Then he realized that in order to reach up for theheart of the rain, he would have to open his shell. At this thought walnut began to tremble. He was very afraid. \"If I open my shell, crow may peck me or some creature eat me, and then I will never reach the heart of the rain.\" But all the time he was thinking, the fresh, soft rain was falling, and the heart of the walnut lled with such tenderness that it pressed against the sides of his shell. Suddenly, with one mighty swell of courage, the little walnut cast his hard shell aside and the two halves fell to the ground. But, crow didn't come to peck him and the forest animals didn't eat him. Instead, out of the heart of the walnut a little green shoot sprang, its tiny green arms stretching up to touch the clouds. As the days passed, it grew taller and taller, nearer and nearer to the clouds, and the tenderness of the walnut's heart changed into a mighty strength. Still the walnut tree kept growing, closer and closer to the clouds, never forgetting the rain. If you get out into the forest today, you will see him there. Always he is reaching out with Ms strong arms, reaching higher and higher, so that one day he may hold the heart of the rain c l o s e t o M s o w n . Dolores Graham, currently a Waldorf parent, has had much teaching experience in Amercia.Discovering the Sea Shore b y D AV I D S H A R M A N What a delight it is to walk on the sea shore with the feel of the sand, the smell of the sea, the cry of its birds, and the restlessness of the waves. This natural space usually allows us to relax and dream, dig sand castles or play in the water. But how many of us are aware of the rich world of plants and animals that inhabit this place? T h e c u r r i c u l u m o f a S t e i n e r s c h o o l suggests courses in botany and zoologyin Classes XI and XII (ages 17 and 18). Here the teacher can introduce the great diversity of the plants and animals and their dependence on one another. How ever, it is also important to introduce a more detailed study of an environment, in order that the pupils can become in volved and observe nature themselves. This is not an easy process and calls for patience and perseverance in the young observers. 18The teaclier has the task of encourage ment and sharing his own observations with them. In this way a world of beauty in form, colour, biological association, feeding habits and reproduction is revealed. This is one of the joys of a teacher and has been mine particularly.In Class XI and XII 1 have arranged short marine biology courses, either as visits to tiie same shore through different seasons, or sometimes, as visits to dif ferent shores over several days. Most of the time the rocky shore is our chosen site, as here arc found a richer variety of organisms, and the plants of the sea s h o r e t h e s e a w e e d s - a r e c o n n e d t o t h e r o c k s f o r s e c u r e a t t a c h m e n t . O u r v i s i t s a r e c h o s e n t o c o i n c i d e w i t h t h e lowest tides, thus most of the shore is exposed for our observation. We always set off carrying collecting equipment - buckets, jars and nets and a notebook and pencil for records. Unfolding wonder Time and tide wait for no man! So sometimes this demands a very early start or a later evening visit. Weather never deters us \u2014 even in a snowstorm and bitter cold we have been on the shore, and so each visit has its own par ticular quality as a total experience. Soon we are scrambling over rocks covered with wet slippery seaweed. Now is the time for a pause and a chance to notice that different types of seaweed live on the shore as we go down to the sea. By this zonation of the seaweeds the shore can be divided into upper, middle and lower zones. The continuous ebb and flow of the tides means that organisms in the upper zone are exposed to the air, wind Jellysh Mussel 20 21and sun for much longer periods tiian those of the lower zone. Hence, all life in the upper zone is seen to be well equipped to resist dessication: their life style is drastically interrupted during the exposure, and life processes only return to normal when covered once more by water. The shape of the seaweeds is impor tant to survive the constant'movement of wave action. The simple dichotomous branching gives it a two-dimensional form, and buoyancy is maintained bysome with air bladders, and by others with their inherent lightness compared with sea water. These plants all belong to the group the Algae - green and photosynthetic by nature, in many of them the green-ness is masked by other pigments, giving a colourful pattern of reds, purples and browns. It is, however, the animal world which a b o u n d s h e r e ; a n i m a l s w i t h o u t b a c k bones (Invertebrates) are especially well represented, and examples of most major groups are found. Fish, of course, are the important vertebrate, though many s e a b i r d s a r e o f t e n s e e n . W h e r e a r e a l l t h e s e a n i m a l s ? A s w e l o o k t o w a r d s o u r feet, trying to maintain the balance of a tight-rope walker, we see little. We are perhaps nearing the lower m i d d l e s h o r e a n d n o w i s t h e t i m e f o r diligent searching, bending down, lifting seaweed, turning and returning stones, peering into every nook and cranny. Now one enters the cool damp animal world. Catching our eye at rst are perhaps the encrusting sponges and brightly coloured sea-anemones, both plant-like and sessile. Many common star sh and sea urchins a r e f o u n d , a n d u n d e r s t o n e s t h e b r i t t l e star hides. These radially symmetrical animals are most beautiful in colour and form. The starsh with great strength can pull open the valves of a mollusc such as the mussel and rapidly digest its softer parts. The sea urchin is a vegetarian and lives by scraping algae from the rock surfaces using its complex tooth-like structure which, when dissected, shows an amazing pentamerous form known as Aristotle's lantern. Crabs and small sii can be disturbed in the rock pools. A rare and exciting nd, Iwell remember one year, was an octopus stranded in a small pool. We were able to catch it in a bucket and all stood round fascinated as we watched its quick breathing and turning to a dark brown colour as it adjusted to its surroundings; even as we watched waves of colourseemed to pass through it. A little later we released this incredible animal into a large pool and watched spell-bound as it swam away using its jet propulsion pulsations to move body rst and ten tacles trailing behind. When barnacles are treasure trove How many of us have cut a foot on a sharp barnacle or tried to move a limpet from its seat? Very seldom can we ob serve the barnacle on the shore in action as a living organism, as it needs to be covered with water to unfold. So this is one of the treasures we take back to our marine aquarium for observation in the laboratory. Limpets, too, only show acti vity when the tide covers them, then they move off to graze on the algae, but always return back to their 'home' seat before the tide ebbs. Now time must be given to looking at our collection, notes taken, photo g r a p h s m a d e . S o m e s p e c i m e n s a r e s e l e c t e d t o t a k e b a c k t o s c h o o l f o r o u r marine tank, the rest are returned to the pools. Containers of sea water must be collected for the aquarium. On our return t o s c h o o l o u r c o l l e c t i o n i s f u r t h e r i n vestigated and identied with the helpof a low powered microscope or magni fying glass. Tliis part of our study reveals so much more than is possible on the shore itself. One summer we brought back a female shore crab 'in berry' and she was put into our aquarium. Next day a puzzling mass of moving specks were seen. On lookingat these under the microscope there danced before our eyes some queer httlecreatures, - a large head, prominent eyes, two spines and a thin body and tail - these were the zoeae larvae of the crab - so unlike the adult, and a wonderful example of the metamorphosis one can nd in marine life. Barnacles too, are a good example of metamorphosis; the sessile adult having transformed from a free swimming larva. These adults we enjoy observing in the aquarium when their feathery limbs un fold and beat in delicate rhythm causing water currents to flow and provide them with food and oxygen. Tiny white calcareous tubes encrust ing rocks, stones and seaweed, when in our aquarium have revealed the beautiful delicate fans of the worms that inhabit them. These worms have also given us the interesting experience to observe the process of fertilization under the microscope. Science turns to man Our thoughts can turn to man and see how he, in his uniqueness, can do many things which an animal, locked in its hardened nature, can only do in a single limited way. Our soft mobile creative hand can use its forenger and thumb for one brief moment to pick up a crab, and for an instant we see it in comparison with the set, harsh pincers, restricted entirely to a grasping nature. For these young people, this experience of the wisdom and beauty of nature en hances for them their own being as man, with his upright stance, his speech andhis thoughts. It teaches them compassion for their fellow creatures and thankful ness in particular to the earth with its mantle of green plants and the gifts therefrom. The outer world can stir the inner world to thoughts of a divine nature even though no words of this are spoken.

The rst sight we noticed as we began to take in the surroundings was a beautiful circular rose garden full of sliimmering colour - delightfully wel coming, especially for an Englishman. This was the rst of many lovely and stimulating experiences we were to have on our visit to the galleries and gardens wliich made up tliis unique exhibition. Vitality and harmony exuded from all the exhibits and displays, together witha quality which spoke of an inner under standing balancing outer form. It was as if the paintings, executed specially for the occasion, had tamed time and space, opening a door to a visual journey which led through the history of garden develop ment. The splash of the water steps cooling the warm air amid the sturdy timber s t a l l s w i t h t h e i r w h i t e c a n v a s a w n ings offering books, plants, pottery and vegetables, immediately set a friend l y m o o d i n t h e e n t r a n c e h a l l o f t h e Liljevalchs Art Gallery, inviting participa tion. From here, the rst few steps into the exhibition were through a scenic garden gateway, conrming the open friendliness, and encouraging the visitor to inquire further. The exhibits chosen, made visible the very roots of garden architecture history, from gardens of the imagination and of Paradise to the exciting possibilities which working with bio- dynamics offers in our present time. Pro gressing through the galleries one was introduced at one moment to the minute detail of a medieval garden tapestry, at the next, to contemplating the moon in cosmic space framed by a Japanese tea house. The grandeur of the French and Italian gardens, the diversity of the English styles, were all depicted in splendid waves of greens, greys and the brighter hues. Here was a history not just of gardens in the ordinary sense, but a revelation of the settings in whichhuman beings have found their relation ships to religion, to art, to science and most especially to the Earth which is t h e i r h o m e . Peace on the Land At a very practical level, the realisation that, to be able to work the earth at all, there must be peace on the land is shown very early in history. The sacred quality surrounding the breaking of the surface of the earth in order to create environments for the growing of crops, the strong relationship of the planetary bodies to the Earth and its plants is a reality quickly realised by man, even tually lost and now rediscovered in the working with biodynamic methods. The message is clear: the more care the Earth is given, the richer are herfruits, not only in nutritional and medicinal terms, but in the manner inwhich our imagination, inspiration and intuition are fed by this process whicii reveals the spirit working in nature. The picture of the meadow sums up much of what is shown at a very simple human level. For in a meadow is the essence of harmony: mineral, plant, animal and man brought together, interwoven with each other and also with the cycle of the year, while being set against the elements. A romantic picture, - of man in his idyllic childhood. Also an archetype needing a modern form to express itself. It is hard to describe how beautiful a garden looks in the late evening, but from the terrace in front of the white house at the Seminar the care and love lavished on the surroundings truly reward the viewer. A short walk from the rose garden leads through beds of medicinal herbs, past the 'crystal palace' (as the glass house is called), bringing one into the green and ferny places close to the still, reed-edged sea; then past the Painter and painting, illustrating the English tradition.biological ponds with their hard-working, swishing water-form-steps*, and once again into the vegetable gardens in timeto catch the sun taking the last blaze of yellow from the marigolds into the darkness of the short Swedish night. One sensed from the faces of the many people who were visiting the Seminar gardens that they too had experienced something rather special, and that they would take into sleep pictures which might provoke a new interest in their lives; a direction perhaps inspired by caring for the land in an artistic, creative manner and brought to vivid attention by the efforts put into forming this ne exhibition. *see page 33 Tony Cooper is Director of First Year Studies at the Canterbury College of Art: School of Architecture.Italian Renaissance i W '^y^ ^LoM '^.:r \"?.-i'^-i5/>^.-9?r?!w One of the main purpose^ ' teaching in a Waldorf-'S^ciiDtil'is' Yo en gender in pupils' minds the idea that the earth is a living being. There are two main obstacles to this: rst, the denitive list of functions \u2014 respiration, growth, repro duction, etc. - that biologists apply to ascertain when an organism is within the biosphere does not necessarily help to understand what a living planet is; andsecond, that pupils, along with the rest of us, experience the planet as it presents itself to their perception, namely as a place, a setting, not as an entity. The rst obstacle may be avoided if the nature of the planet in its totality - barysphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and pyrosphere - is studied to begin with, omitting classica tions and denitive lists as far as possible in order to discover whether or not some of these same qualities we know to characterize plants, animals and humans can be seen in the planetary organisation. The second obstacle will only be removedif the teacher's powers of description evoke imagination in his pupils; only the perceptive power of the mind can experience the planet in its totality;we cannot all undertake astronautical expeditions. In the Class X geography main lesson the teacher can begin with the size of the earth. It is a spheroid of about 25,000 miles circumference; of which only some 3-30 miles form the crust, or lithosphere. The highest mountain peak reaches only about eleven miles above the deepest ocean floor. Thus the great peaks and depths would make the globe no rougher to the touch than a basketball, were the earth's diameter r e d u c e d t o a b o u t o n e f o o t . O n i t s s k i n like crust lies a ne lm of water and around it moves a thin membrane of air. The water lm or hydrosphere covers more than three quarters of the surface and is typically only a mile or two in depth; the air membrane or atmosphere is about ten miles thick at the equator and about half that at the poles. Both the hydrosphere and the atmospherebear substantial quantities of powdered lithosphere or dust. The earth, water and air, fed by solar re and reactive to it, constitute the biosphere \u2014 a living environment for the organisms that inhabit the planet.This environment is both supportive and protective. (The air, for example, lters or reflects those solar emanations that are harmful to life.) The life support system is made possible through the transfer and movement of heat, air, water and - surprisingly - earth. This move-inent is seen in the tides, currents and waves of the sea, in the quaking and eruptions of the land, and above all in the phenomena of weather and climate in the air. These latter phenomena con stitute the main subject of study with 15-year-olds in the Waldorf geography curriculum. In the short space available here it is not possible to discuss the vast range of detailed topics that can and should be studied \u2014 the water cycle of evaporation, condensation, and precipitation, the pattern of global climatic distribution, the structure and chemistry of the at- niosphere, the creation of soil, etc. etc. - and thus it may be most effective to look briefly at one specic sub-topic, clouds, in order to see how it may be handled. C l o u d s a r e c o n s t i t u t e d o f n u m b e r l e s s water droplets or ice particles, each condensed round a dust particle nucleus:this is so regardless of whether we speak of low dark clouds, high light clouds or morning mist. The different shades are primarily the consequence of the size and density of the water or ice particles. But it is the shapes of the clouds, not their physical composition, that are their true hallmarks of character, and in observing them the teacher has an unusual opportunity to demonstrate Goethean thinking at work. Clearer about Clouds It is nine o'clock on a bright, breezy morning in late April, when the class makes its way to a low rise that serves as our observation point. From the westernhorizon and stretching to the zenith, is a pattern of wispy, very white clouds clearly etched against the blue of thesky. They take the form of loosely gathered delicate strands trending east- west and curving in long, gentle arcs, sometimes with frizzed ends. Longago their form led people to call them mares' tails. They seem to be very high and it is not possible to see any move ment in them. An hour and a half later we go out to see if the cloudscape has changed. The mares' tails have moved east. Now on the western skyline there are thicker clouds - a more closely packed layer, medium gray, with its edges crumbling or rounded; o c c a s i o n a l g a p s s h o w, e v e n i n o u r oblique view of them. At a higher level, and of a lighter shade, is a sh-shaped layer of small fluffy clouds hazily joined- mackerel cloud is its name \u2014 and stretch ing eastward after the departing cirrus. Slow movement can be discerned; it is clouding over, and if we were to remain observing the sky for the next ten or twelve hours we would see the lowest stratum completely cover the sky, thickening and darkening as it did so and nally dropping drizzle and light rain. Later in the week we see some ne examples of anvil clouds, great columns of billowing, piled cauliflower shapes rising from a dark stratied base to a white, fuzzed horizontal cap, the whole gradually bulging out in knobbed growths, edges clearly etched against the blue of the sky. If we were to watch them longer - and follow them, for theytravel - we might observe lightning,thunder and a heavy downpour, possibly including hail. Observing the massive cauliflowers, the milky sheets, the jagged fragments, the sh-scale layers, the wispy strands, the brooding blue-black ceilings or the m u l t i t u d e o f o t h e r c l o u d - f o r m s , t h e pupil has the task of discerning the formative principles at work in determin ing what he sees.

Further work on the effect of rhytlims upon growing organisms^\"^ may lead to the knowledge of the types of rhythm which are most benecial and perhaps, which are the reverse. By learning to read the pheno menon in this way, the relation between water and its life sustaining quality is sought. A complementary aspect of the work c o n c e r n s t h e a c t i v e f u r t h e r a n c e o f George Adams' projective geometric work to fmd how these processes may be under stood as an inter-working of space and c o u n t e r - s p a c e . S u c h r e s e a r c h e s m a y lead to further insiglits into the nature of the liquid state and its relation to life forms. The importance of rhythms is also becoming clear here, but such ndings have yet to be nalised and published. The success of this work will depend on our ability to develop artistic insight into the nature of rhythm, com bined with genuine Geotheanistic obser vation of its manifest quality. What is really being said here is that the artistic and the scientic aspects of the work, are being increasingly closely interwoven. Surface and flow In addition to the actual movements generated in the water, we have to study the characteristics and influences of thesurfaces themselves which make up the FlowCorm vessels. Normally, these sur faces are designed empirically in sym pathy with the water passing over them. It is also possible to let such surfaces be inspired directly from natural growth processes found in shells, buds etc. A further step concerns the use of 'ideal' mathematical surfaces (or 'path-curve' surfaces), as it is towards such surfaces that organisms strive. George Adams began mathematical investigations with water in the early sixties. Lawrence Edwards has since continued Ms study of organic forms. He begins tentatively to say that those buds, for instance, which achieve most clearly the 'ideal'form towards which the plant is striving, are the most vigorous. The form seems to provide the vehicle for the life forces. Such work supports our intentions'^ very positively. The fundamental theme of the Group's w o r k c o n c e r n s t h e f a c t t h a t f o r m s c a n bring about rhythms in water owing o v e r t h e m . A s m a l l t r i c k l e o f w a t e r streaming over a smooth, slightly sloping surface, generates meander patterns. Evenhere, when the form and proportions of the water's boundaries are organised correctly, the stream begins to pulsate. The heart function is born.''' The river may be considered as the heart of the earth in that it regulates the flow of the earth's blood - water.'\u00ae In it and around it, life should abound. The river is the region of water's most i n t e n s i v e i n v o l v e m e n t w i t h i t s o w n physical nature and there can be at the same time, a 'sensing' of the total organism's state of health through the very quality of that abounding life. We see the whole water cycle in stages of contraction from cloud via rain to the tributaries and further. There is a process of preparation in coming inwards from the totally expanded condition through vigorous movement and interchange with t h e a i r. T h e r i v e r i t s e l f f o l l o w s w i t h i t s meandering forms and inner innitude 34of whirling, swirling movements. It expands via the delta to the ocean's salty state from which water can again evaporate. Considering the earth as an organism in such a way, we see the total water cycle as a breathing in and out. Can we create vessels, an organ, forms which will enhance the 'medial' heart function of the river? The sevenfold process here described inspires a picture of a sevenfold sequence of rhythms.^\u00ae Flowforms of gradually increasing size provide in the 'medial' stage a large form in which the previous vigorous move ments may be 'digested'. The water then streams on, concentrating the assimilated movement. Again a kind of breathing in and out of rhythms. In terms of life processes in an organism,*'' there is a taking-in of substance and forces, a working with this intake and a utilisation of these effects in space and time.

Sussex. All teachers will be glad to welcome the long awaited translation of the course of 14 lectures given to Basel teachers in 1920, class teachers in particular perhaps, as so much can be learned from them of the develop ment of the child from seven to fourteen. Rudolf Steiner begins with an introductory lecture which, although given after the rst World War, is curious ly applicable to our own times. He speaks, for example,of social chaos in Europe and warns that it will get worse, for in spite of those who call loudly for social ism, few show a really social attitude. He goes on to consider the whole human being, which can only be understood with the help of spiritual science. He speaks of the threefold man, the nerve- sense man, the rhythmic organisation and the metabolic system and then of the thinking, feeling and willing and points out that knowledge of man is the basis of the art of education. Later he speaks of the curriculum as a whole and of various subjects such as eurythmy, music and language lessons. In the eighth lecture he gives a wonderful description of how the animal and plant periods should be given to children after the ninth year, when the child can differentiate between himself and the world. At this time he needs to develop his faculties of intellect and also his heart forces. A further lecture speaks of the rhythmical element in education; Steiner applies this in the widest sense, even pointing out that listening to rhythmical speech is a help to right spelling. This, no doubt, applies moreto German spelling than English. We are indebted to Roland Everett for a very good, clear translation of these valuable lectures. J. M. RusseU Move in Time by Jean Hunt. 34 pp, paperback. Published by Mary Nash-Wortham for'Take Time Products'.Jean Hunt has drawn on her 15 years' experience as Eurythmist, 8 years work with maladjusted and dis turbed children and more recently as movement therapist - part of a research group of the Learning Disabilities Clinic of St. Thomas' Hospital, London,to produce a most helpful and valuable aid for mothersand teachers who wish to take up the challenge of therapeutic work with their children. She has \"taken exercises from the eld of Eurythmy which are appropriate to the cognitive and motor problems associated with reading and writing ... By working in an imaginative way with the child his dexterity, ability to move and even inner cognitive ability can be helped.\"Each exercise is fully explained with clear illustra tions so that following the sequence of 16 parts is straightforward. Helpful techniques are given for developing the exercises further which stimulates us to nd our own ways into the therapeutic process.

Floris Books, 21 Napier Road, Edinburgh EHIO 5AZ Nuclear Energy A spiritual perspective by Michael Jones. Published by Floris Books, Paperback. \u00a32.75. This is a lucid and widely-referenced book, by a priest of the Christian Community, which speaks out with religious fervour against not only nuclear power, but also against atomic ssion as such, and modern energy-intensive technology as a whole. When 1 hadread through the rst half, 1 was under the happy impression that here at last was a book from the anti- nuclear camp that could be appreciated by some of my own colleagues in the nuclear industry. For itdescribes some of the early discoveries and some current ideas in atomic physics, and relates them to Avider issues. Any fruitful exchange between nuclear power professionals and critics of nuclear power mustbegin along such lines. But then I became disappointed, as Michael Jones proceeds to discuss the attributes of Lucifer and Ahriman, Rudolf Steiner's names for the twin powers of evil, spiritual beings working through technology against the Christian powers of redemption, and nally he damns nuclear ssion as being wholly against evolution, and in fact anti-Christian. Now many people in the nuclear industry, like myself, are Christians, but are not anthroposophists, and so clearly could not take Jones's viewpoints on board, or they would be obliged to resign from their job. In general 1 found Nuclear Energy very readable, lively, well-informed, and accurate on the technical issues without being laborious. Most of the illustrations are clear and helpful, though the three diagrams in the fourth chapter of the main types of nuclear reactor are almost unlabelled, and hence assume much familiarity with the shapes of reactor components. In the fthchapter, on capra and the dance of life, Michael Jones quotes a most remarkable passage by the Polish poet Slowacki (1809 - 49), describing his own personal participation in the creation of the world. Slowacki describes how plant life began to appear as a result of The Lord striking and breaking up the rock withlightning, life thus arising from \"the rst death\". The sixth chapter on elements and ethers is especial ly clear and concise, outlining the ethers' origins in thethree former planetary evolutions, as described in much detail by Rudolf Steiner in his Occult Science. Jones justies his several quotations in the book from Steiner, I'm glad to say, by referring to various con temporary ideas in science that are compatible to some extent with Steiner's descriptions. Books written by anthroposophists for the general public should not quote Steiner arbitrarily, nor even apparently so. We should be grateful to Michael Jones for tracing the specic origin of the heaviest radioactive elements, at least, to one particular stage in the earth's develop ment: see chapter 8. To my knowledge this is the rst time that this has been done. B u t h e c o n c l u d e s t h a t n u c l e a r s s i o n a n d h e n c e nuclear power is totally bad, and no good: evil and good in the full moral, religious sense. As a professional in this eld, 1 nd that such an extreme interpretation goes quite against life experience. Assisting in the fuel ling of a nuclear power reactor, standing on top of it in fact, did I once feel surrounded by great forces of ghastly evil, working with people having a cold, ruthless lust for power? Categoricdly, No. A book review is not the place for extended argu ments for and against the relative costs of nuclear power, as against coal, oil, solar or wind power. Sufcient to say that they are all expensive, for power on an industrial scale. If you want nice cheap power, you will need to get rid of industry, and cities! I nd that there are positive, even Christian, aspects to nuclear energy, particularly in the area of job-responsibilities and cooperation, and similarly experience for the future. This book refers only in passing to the growing problems of nuclear waste. But I hope that ways of dealing with this can be developed that directly involve forces of healing. Then spiritual science really would come of age. Robert Kersey Green A Scientist of the Invisible. An Introduction to the life and work of Rudolf Steiner. by A. P. Shepherd. Floris Books. Soft back. \u00a33.95. 222 pp. The work of Rudolf Steiner is so manifold and its implications so far-reaching that it is a major task to present these in introductory form in a single volume. Thirty years ago Canon Shepherd successfully under took this task, this edition being the rst reprint. Through courses as intricately interconnected as the Norfolk Broads he navigates the reader, always keeping to the main stream while pointing out a wealth of tributaries for further exploration. In the last chapter he refers to Rudolf Steiner as hav ing remarked that for anthroposophy to be grasped in Britain it needed to be presented through the thoughts of British minds. The book is still a leading example of that, ideal for the bookstall at PTA functions, public lectures and in the school ofce for serious enquirers. Already it has been a crucial life-line for many people, justifying its being termed a 'classic'. However, was it not possible to up-date the biblio graphy for further reading, scattered through the foot notes, in an addenda or some other form? This would have been more representative of continuing antrhopo- sophical research, with fewer references o/p, and a silent tribute to Shepherd's resourceful spirit and truly contemporary insight.Genesis by Emil Bock 18 pp hardback \u00a38.50 Non-German readers waited some seven years before 'The Three Years' was published in English.It is forty-nine years since the present work rst appeared under the original title 'Urgeschichte'. Emil Bock is able to read so many things 'like a book': in the landscape of the Near East; in the journeys of Abraham and others through this land scape; in the symbolism in Noah's dove, in Lot's wife's pillar of salt, in Melchisedek's bread and wine or in Babel's tower; also in the less familiar imagery of Jewish legend. Through such outstanding ability, together with an unusual power of description, he isable to lead the student of Genesis into a deeper understanding of occult traditions. In his hands this unparalleled document of 'cosmic-, mythological- and historical-history' begins to yield further secrets. Bible students owe Floris Books a great debt of patitude for making this rich source of inspiration available in English translation. Nothing to do with me? The Individual and the Com munity. by Alexander Bos. Floris Books. \u00a31.25, 44 pages. Soft linen. In \"The devil with the three golden hairs\" the child of good fortune discovers that it is a mouse gnawing at the roots of the unfruitful tree, which causes the townsfolk's sorrow. Within the compass of these few pages, Alexander Bos digs deep to the roots of today's inflation: the seeming power of the multi-national, insurance mania, the arms industry, the welfare state's tax system, space travel and - yes, another sword drawn - TV. And what Brobdingnagian mice he nds! But his thesis is - and for this one can be grateful - that means, well within the possibility of each indivi dual, can be found \"to guide and order their acts,\" quoting his closing words, \"to prevent social collapse.\" An encouraging outlook. Biblical Rhythms in Biography by Diether Lauenstein Floris Books \u00a32.95 125 pp. Soft linen. \"In the forties, a woman sees how her children are growing up. With children around, we are able to re- experience the stages of our own growth. In this way, our souls are kept fresh ...\" Diether Lauenstein gives birth to many ideas which shed light on biography. Aswith 'children around', we are able to recognise stagesof growth, and also deepen our understanding of them. The refreshment - to return to familiar scenes by a new path. A scholarly path, yet not without landmarks lining the way, which have a fascination of their own: the collared attire of the sixth century Byzantine athlete, the death garlands of myrtle worn by the Eleusinian youths, Haroun al Raschid's youngest son's departing words to his father, Frederick the Great's threadbare cloak. The keynote of the author's argu ment lies in the frequent biblical references; many readers may nd nevertheless that it is the octave of life experience which leaves the more lasting impression. Biodynamic Gardening by John Soper, Biodynamic Agricultural Stourbridge, DY9 9PX. Paper. 158 pp. A fairly sharp walk to the tool shed is the mood of John Soper's prefatory remarks in this book, after which he adopts a 'dig like tliis' or 'test the soilstructure by holding it in your hand like that' method of instruction. Yet there is more scientic reference and research in and behind this method than meetsthe contents- or index-scanning eye. I suppose a gardener as experienced as this writer can easily afford to hide this land of scientic light under his rich bushel of practical hints and sound, well tested advice. The gardener in each reader - and what Waldorf parent or teacher can afford to employ someone else to 'do the garden'? - can only be grateful for such a procedure. But in addition, there is a fascinating harvestto be gathered of facts relating to ecology, plant nature, weather, worm population, bio-dynamic com post making etc. alongside all that you would expect in a gardening book. A ne demonstration of the approach which is increasingly needed to succeed the niuck and magic that served the gardeners supplying our grandparents' dinner tables, and the 'articials' which have since flooded the market. Books Received in German from Verlag Freies Geistesleben, Haussmannstrasse 76, 7000 Stuttgart und Erzieher, Band 5}. This book contains four very ne glove-puppet plays for the main festivals of the year and they contain a richness of fantasy and humour. The child would quietly connect himself with the character of Kasper, who seems to have a little of everything in him, but fundamentally a will to do good. They are excellent plays for the child entering Qass Ior a little older. Hanschen Apfelkern Gesammelt (Arbeitsmaterial aus den Waldorf-Kindergarten, Band 8J. This is a beautiful collection of short stories very suitable for the young child, both for telling or for using as puppet plays. They are told so well that children are captivated by the fantasy and the wonder ful pictures that are in them.

Dear Editors, 1 am always interested to receive your magazine and enjoy the little bits of insight I get into Waldorf Educa tion through it. In Vol. 17 No. 2, which I Just received, I found some correspondence about Alan Howard's article (in Vol. 17 No. 1), in which he suggests that the 'spiritual world' might engineer a nuclear catastrophe in order to wipe the slate clean so we can start again. In the current issue there is another letter explain ing his point of view further. I think the things I found most difcult in both Mr. Howard's writings on this issue are; 1. his apparent equanimity about this possibility and 2. the comparison between the relationship of humanity to the spiritual world and the relationship between a wayward child and a parent. \"It is a naive view of the spiritual world to think that after endowing us with the capacities it has, it is going to stand idly by while we play fast and loose with them in a most wanton way.\" 1 nd this kind of viewpoint very little different from the old God the Father and Judge notions 1 received in my Roman Catholic Education. If you don't toe the line God will punish you. As if the spiritual hierarchy were like some monstrous adminis tration deciding in its wisdom that if we humans in our folly play about with socialism/communism/audio visual technology, then the consequences will be nuclear war and the end of life for all. As a supporter of C.N.D. 1 have always said in discussion that I am against nuclear weapons because they would wipe out totally life as we know it. Whereas if there is life (under whatever domination) then there continued from page 32 teenagers' own families and who are very likely helping to pay (via prots and dividends if not by more direct means) the fee-contributions that keep them at school. Pupils do not nd it so'j easy to see or feel that their own appetite for consumer goods is the force that sucks the products out of industry and thus keeps the industrial res burning. ' Time and again they are surprised to realise how we have all become depen dent on the internal combustion engine f o r t h e n e c e s s i t i e s a n d c o m f o r t s o f everyday life: shelter, transport, food, clothing and most entertainment in its modem form cannot be provided with out using the planet's energy store andis always hope and the possibility of change. Mr. Howard's views come over as fanatical. In your current issue there is another article which 1 feel is spoiled; that is the article \"Temptations of the Ego\" by Tony Brown. 1 thought this article contained a very good analysis of the effects and appeal of many modern cults. When Mr. Brown is talking about the meditation techniques he asks: \"What sorts of influence does the human being lay himself open to when his wide awake consciousness is subdued in this manner?\" This is a perfectly valid comment asking what really are the effects of these practices? But later in the article he makes a different kind of comment. He says, in discussion of the guru gures and the \"forms of salvation\" they offer, \"can we not detect an almost blasphemous disregard for the saving work of the Christ?\" And he continues with quotations from the gospels about the second coming and false Christs etc. He continues \"Armed with such a knowledge (of the gospels?), the adolescent can hopefully nd his rightful path ...\" This type of comment is only valid from within a particular religious framework, it only makes sense if the reader already accepts \"the saving work of the Christ\". The word \"blasphemous\" rings warning bells for me. From making an objective appraisal of cults and sects, in this latter type of criticism Tony Brown steps down to make criticism of cults from the point of v i e w o f w i t h i n a n o t h e r c u l t . This 1 found very disappointing coming at the end of an article which on the whole I found very apt and succinct. Yours faithfully, Tom Hart Shea. creating waste. The economic and eco logical chains mean that each half-hour of TV watching or joy-riding in the new car affects the planet - minutely but cumulatively. Discussion with teenagers soon makes it clear how hard they nd i t t o m a k e t h i s c o n n e c t i o n . P r a c t i c a l work in environmentally benecial pro jects is one step in the consciousness- raising process that schools can take, and it is then not too difcult to speak of ecological thrift in daily life as a service to the earth.

(144 pp.) D E E P E R I N S I G H T S I N E D U C AT I O N : T H E WA L DORF APPROACH by Rudolf Steiner. Steiner be gins these three lectures to the Stuttgart Waldorf teachers of Oct. 15-16, 1923. by explaining why mod ern education requires a new synthesis of the three historical ideals of educator: spiritual gymnast, en souled rhetorician, and intellectual professor. He proceeds to give several examples of how the teacher can develop a living, artistic speech and also details many of the physiological effects on the student of the teacher's deeds. The perception of such hidden rela tionships between education and human development will kindle in the teacher enthusiasm and a sense of responsibility for the great social task of a renewed education, (ca. 50 pp) Paper. $5.95 #703 SEND FOR A FREE CATALOG OF OUR COMPLETE LIST.
