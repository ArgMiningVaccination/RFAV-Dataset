Medicare requires an acupuncture provider to have one of the following degrees or specialties: MD, DO, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist or auxiliary person with a master's or doctoral-level degree in acupuncture or Oriental Medicine from an ACAOM-approved school. They must also have an unrestricted active license to practice acupuncture in the state.

[Medicare Part B cost-sharing](https://www.senior65.com/medicare/article/2023-medicare-premiums-deductibles-and-costs) covers 80% for 12 acupuncture visits in 90 days for chronic low back pain. Medicare defines chronic back pain as follows: - Lasting 12 weeks or longer - Having no identifiable systemic cause (not associated with metastatic, inflammatory, or infectious disease) - Pain that's not associated with surgery or pregnancy An additional 8 sessions will be covered if the person shows improvement. If the doctor decides the chronic low back pain isn't improving or is getting worse, then Medicare won't cover the treatments. No more than 20 acupuncture treatments can be given yearly.
