In 1854, Dr. Still, then a practicing allopathic physician in Kansas, became increasingly dissatisfied with the medical practices of his day. He developed a new theory of medicine, which he called osteopathy. He based his new approach to health care on the concepts of body unity, the body's inherent ability to heal itself given all the optimum conditions, and on the proper alignment and function of the musculoskeletal system. CUSOM takes pride in bringing the philosophies of Dr. Still to North Carolina. Over the years, the pra ctice of medicine h as evolved and so h as the practice of osteop athic medi cine. Today, do ctors of osteop athic medi cine (D Os) serve the public with full medical practice privil eges. Ost eopathic physici ans are trained in all the mode rn practices science has to of fer in medic al and surgic al care while incorpor ating the concept of tr eating the whole p erson throughout the training. Ost eopathic physici ans believe hands-on examination (palpation) is an essential p art of making a physic al diagnosis. In addition to ph armacologic tr eatment and surg ery, manipulative medi cine remains an import ant the rapeutic tool utiliz ed by osteop athic physici ans in alleviating pain and tr eating illness. The tr aining of osteop athic physi cians has always stressed a primary care orientation. Four Tenets of Osteopathic Medicine 1. The body is a uni t; the person is a unit of mind, body and spirit 2. The body is capable of self-regulation, self-healing, and health maintenance 3. Structure and function are reciprocally interrelated 4. Rational treatment is based on the above three principles 2.7 Osteopathic Oath I do h ereby affirm my loy alty to the pro fession I am about to enter. I will be mindful always of my gre at responsibility to pres erve the he alth and the life of my p atients, to retain their confid ence and resp ect both as a physici an and a f riend who will gu ard their secrets with s crupulous honor and fid elity, to p erform faithfully my profession al duti es, to employ only those re cogniz ed methods of tr eatment consistent with good judgment and with my skill and ability, ke eping in mind always n ature's la ws and the body's inherent capacity for re covery. I will be ever vigil ant in aiding in the g eneral welfare of the community, sust aining i ts laws and institutions, not engaging in those pra ctices, whi ch will in any way, bring shame or discr edit upon my pro fession or mys elf. I will give no drugs for d eadly purpos es to any person, though it be asked of me. I will endeavor to wo rk in accord with my colleagues in a spirit of progressive cooperation and never by wo rd or by act cast imput ations upon th em or their rightful practices. 20 I will look with resp ect and esteem upon all those who h ave taught me my art. To my college I will be loy al and strive always for its b est int erests and for the int erests of the students who will come after me. I will be ever alert to fu rther the application of b asic biologic truths to the h ealing arts and to evelop the prin ciples of ost eopathy, whi ch were first enunciated by And rew Taylor Still. 21 3.

Each applicant's compassion, knowledge, and commitment to healthcare and the CUSOM Mission . The CUSOM Admissions ersonal Medic al Coll ege Admissions T est (MCAT) s cores, letters of re comm endation, he alth-related work and research and volunt eer exp erience. In addition to academic p erformance, the Admissions Committee pla ces emphasis on the ethical treatment of all humanity, the d emonstr ation of p ersonal merit, integrity, d edication to pro fessional go als, and the promotion of dive rsity. 22 Faculty and staff evaluations provided after each candidate's interview are utilized by the Admissions Committee in making their recommendation to the Dean regarding whether the candidate should be granted or denied acceptance. The D ean consid ers the recommendations from the committee before making the final decision on each candidate. The Dean, as the Chief Academic Officer, or the Dean's designee, makes final decisions on candidate status. The CUSOM Offi ce of Admissions maintains pre -admission academic and demogr aphic d ata for each mat riculating class. Upon gradu ation, the Of fice of the Registrar wo rks in conjun ction with the CUSOM Alumni Asso ciation and creditation and M edical Educ ation to tr ack licensing examination performance, specialty certification, post -gradu ate employment , and career activities for each gradu ating class. Through this pro cess, CUSOM is able to evaluate and adjust recruitm ent practices and policies to ensure the Mission and Go als of the institution a re being met. 3.2 Requirements for Ad mission To be consid ered for an int erview, appli cants for admission to CUSOM are requir ed to compl ete a minimum of 75 per cent of the r equired credits for a degree at a college or unive rsity accredit ed by an agency r ecogniz ed by the United Stat es Department of Education. To be consid ered for admission, applicants must h ave earned, or are scheduled to earn, a baccalaureate degree prior to mat riculation at CUSOM and submit s cores f rom the Medical Coll ege Admission T est (MCAT ). For the current admission cy cle, CUSOM will accept the MCAT administration up to thr ee years prior to the ye ar of mat riculation unless with the D ean's exception. Competitive applicants to CUSOM have overall MCAT s cores at the 50th percentile or higher with a preferred score in the 50th percentile or higher in Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems (BBFLS). The most competitive applicants h ave high er MCAT scores. Applicants should have achieved at least a 3.2 Science and Overall cumulative grade point average (GPA) on a 4.0 scale. The most competitive applicants have higher Science and Overall cumulative GPAs. The admissions process is highly competitive, and higher GPAs and MCAT scores may increase chances for acceptance. CUSOM also places emphasis on the applicant's interview. The requir ed und ergradu ate courses for entry are: Biological Sciences: One year with laboratory (8 semest er hours/12 qu arter hours) Physics: One year (6 to 8 semest er hours/9 to 12 quarter hours) Inorganic/General Chemistry: One year with l aboratory (8 semester hours/12 quarter hours) 23 Organic Ch emistry: One year with labo ratory (8 semest er hours/12 qu arter hours ); the second semester of Organic Chemistry can be substituted by Biochemistry English: One year (6 semest er hours/8 qu arter hours) Six (6) additional science hours are highly recommended. CUSOM recommends courses in the 300/400 level or higher, such as Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Genetics, Mic robiology, and Immunolo gy, which may enhance performance in medi cal school. NOTE: Courses with equivalent content will be reviewed. NOTE: Students must obtain a grade of \"C\" or better in each of the required courses above to fulfill the pre-requisite course requirement. Applic ants are requir ed to me et the T echnical Standards, including required immunizations for healthcare workers, for admission and continu ed enrollm ent, and affirm that he or she m eets the stand ards. Any falsifi cation or misinfo rmation (e.g. , not disclosing prior mat riculation a known, pre -existing, issue whi ch would le ad to not meeting the Te chnical Standards) regarding the ability to me et the T echnical Standards may result in dismissal from the program. Applic ants must submit all requir ed paperwork per published d eadlines outlined by the Office of Admissions. If p aperwork is not submitted and received as required, an off er of admission may be rescinded. 3.3 Technical Standards and Vaccination Requirements for Admission to CUSOM The requir ements to su cceed at CUSOM are those n ecessary to su ccessfully compl ete the curriculum and to pra ctice osteop athic medi cine with full pra ctice rights. Students must be able to function in a v ariety of le arning and clinical settings, and to quickly, accurately, and consistently le arn and proc ess data. Ost eopathic physici ans utilize palpation (clinic ally appropriate touching) as part of the physical examination and osteop athic approa ch to tr eatment. As p art of the educational proc ess, CUSOM students must be able to tol erate b eing palpated , examined and rec eive ost eopathic manipulation by memb ers of all genders, and to palpate , examine , and provide osteop athic manipulation to othe rs (of all genders) in order to acquire the skills n ecessary for palpation and examination. This p alpation is p erformed in a pro fession al and appropriate manner. Acquiring the skills to palpate and examine p atients requir es a student to examine partially disrob ed patients of all genders and is mandatory for su ccessful completion of the curriculum at CUSOM. Students are requir ed to parti cipate fully as both the examiner and examinee in v arious clinical labor atory experiences. In Clinical Skills and Osteop athic Manipulative M edicine laboratory experiences, as well as oth er clinic al laboratori es where physical examination skills are acquired, students are requir ed to participate in the examination of fellow students of all gend ers who may be partially disrob ed. 24 In ord er to be able to g ain appropriate clinical exposure to the regions b eing examined and osteop athic manipulative te chniques to be performed , students n eed to w ear attire, such as shorts and are expected to partially disrobe for c ertain labo ratory experiences. Please refer to the Dress Code Policy (Section 6.5 of this Bulletin ) for additional information. Addition ally, CUSOM utiliz es cadavers in the gross anatomy laboratory. As such, CUSOM students must be able to tol erate wo rking with, and touching, c adavers. CUSOM students also p articipate in ultrasound l abs and, as such, will be requir ed to perform ultr asound examination of fellow students of all genders who may be p artially disrob ed. These are requirements for all students, regardless of cultural or religious beliefs, except where required by law . Students who have any concern regarding these requirements should discuss them with the Office of Student Affairs prior to applying. CUSOM will make re asonable accommod ations as requir ed by law for students whose disabilities will not prev ent them f rom su ccessfully compl eting the CUSOM curriculum and gradu ating as an osteopathic physici an. Students, how ever, are required to function with indep endence and perform at all skill lev els described below which CUSOM holds as mand atory for the safe and effective practice of ost eopathic medicine. CUSOM is committed to p atient saf ety and assuring a safe and ef fective environment that do es not pla ce patients, stud ents, or othe rs at unnecessary risk. E ach Te chnical Stand ard has been chosen from standards osteop athic physici ans deem necessary for the safe and pr actice of osteop athic medi cine. Appl icants who do not meet the Technical Standards and Vaccination Requirements should not apply to CUSOM. Students/Applicants must possess the requisite abilities and skills in the following six (6) areas: 1. Observation The student must be able to visually observe laboratory d emonstr ations, microscopic tissue with the aid of the mi croscope, and electronic imag es used in classroom presentations and labo ratory d emonstr ations. The student must be able to visu ally and accurately obs erve physic al signs and symptoms of a patient used in diagnosis and clinical manag ement. The use of a tr ained intermedi ary in su ch cases would compromise p erformance, as it would be medi ated by another individual 's pow er of s election, obs ervation, and experience. Obs ervation requir es the functional use of vision and somatic sensations and is oft en enhanced by the sense of smell . 25 2. Communication The student must be able to communi cate effectively in English, as the curriculum and clinical experiences are offered exclusively in English. Students are encourag ed to le arn other languag es for m edical communic ation; how ever, the entire curriculum and all assessment exercises are provided in English. CUSOM r equires the fun ctional ability to sp eak, hear, and obs erve p atients in order to elicit accurate medic al info rmation. The student must be able to both describe changes in mood, activity, posture, and other physic al characteristi cs and to pe rceive nonv cation. The student must be able to communic ate effectively and efficiently in verb al and w ritten fo rm. The student must be able to communic ate effectively and effici ently with patients and with all memb ers of the h ealthcare team in or der to successfully compl ete the curriculum. 3.

The student must h ave suf ficient motor function to carry out man euvers of g eneral and emerg ent medical care and of osteop athic manipulation. Ex amples of emergent motor functions includ e, but are not limited to, cardiopulmonary resus citation, placement of central venous access , administration of intr avenous fluids and intrav enous me dications, management of an obstructed airway, h emorrhage control, wound closure by suturing, and obstetrical deliveri es. In addition, osteop athic manipulation requir es the use of the provider's extremities in p alpation, positioning, and carrying out man euvers of manipulation. Th ese actions require fine and gross motor control, as well as the sense of touch and adequate vision f or insp ection. Students must be able to generate suf ficient forc e, and be able to receive these same fo rces, to successfully le arn and provide effective osteopathic manipulative tr eatments for all techniques taught in the curriculum which include, but are not limited to, muscle energy, counte rstrain, Still technique, and high -velocity, low amplitude (HVLA). 4. Intellectual The student must h ave the ability to r eason, calcul ate, analyze, measure, and synthesize info rmation d elivered in a v ariety of form ats, including, but not limited to, electronic/digital sources, EKGs, medical images , and similar modaliti es.

The student must be able to acquire and synthesize knowl edge through various types of learning materi als and fo rmats utiliz ed in the CUSOM curriculum. In addition, students must be able to p erform p attern recognition, re call info rmation, id entify and discriminate important information, problem solve, calculate , and make decisions in tim ed situations and in the p resence of noise and distra ctions. The above int ellectual abilities are essential, as stud ents and gradu ates are expected and requir ed to p erform p attern re cognition, immediate re call of learned mat erial, disc rimination to elicit import ant info rmation, probl em solving, and d ecision -making in the emerg ent diagnosis and tre atment of patients. Students must be able to rec all and apply import ant info rmation to generate a differ ential diagnosis and to d evelop a ther apeutic manag ement for emerg type of d emonstr ated int ellectual ability must be performed in a rapid and time -efficient mann er in order to provide appropriate care to patients with emergent conditions. It is common for emergent situ ations to o ccur in the pr esence of visually distracting and noisy environme nts. Su ch emerg ent situ ations includ e, but are not to, cardiopulmon ary cardiopulmon es, shock, and hemorrhage. 5. Behavioral a nd Social Attributes The student must possess the emotional h ealth n eeded for full use of their intelle ctual capabilities at all times. The emotion al health requir ed for effective communic ation and for prof ession al, matu re, sensitive, and compassion ate patient/physici an or patient/student r elationships must be p resent.

Students must h ave the emotional stability and motiv ation to deliver patient care and to m ake emerg ent de cisions at all times. The ability to adapt to changing environme nts and str essful situ ations and to display compassion and integrity, while maintaining the n ecessary int ellectual capacity to care for p atients, is one evaluated during the int erview proc ess and throughout the student's progr ess in the medi cal school curriculum. 27 An ability to d emonstr ate the emotional h ealth ne cessary for the d elivery of quality and safe medi cal care is mand atory throughout medi cal school. CUSOM consid ers drug and alcohol addiction or abuse a signifi cant risk f actor for providing uns afe patient care and poor p atient outcom es. As su ch, CUSOM h cies reg arding alcohol and subst ance abuse (See Section 3.16.5 of this Bulletin ). 6. Vaccination Requirements Verification that all vaccination requirements are fully met or in progress is required by July 1. Accepted students who have not verified vaccination requirements are fully met or in progress by July 1 prior to matriculation may have their offer of admission rescinded . Students who have their offer of admission rescinded will forfeit their seat in the class and their deposit will not be refunded. See Section 3.16 of this Bulletin for addition al information. Applicants must identify to the Office of Student Affairs all areas where there is any question regarding their ability to meet these Technical Standards. If an applicant has a question about their ability to meet the minimal Technical Standards, the applicant is required to notify the Office of Student Affairs in advance of applying. An offer of acceptance may be rescinded should an accepted applicant NOT meet the Technical Standards and Vaccination Requirements for Admission to CUSOM, or be found to not be able to meet the se Technical Standards and Vaccination Requirements following matriculation (See Section 3.16) . For matriculated students, inabilit y to maintain compliance with educational training Technical Standards including vaccinations may result in Dismissal from the program. If an applicant signs they meet the minimum health requirements, including required vaccination standards , and Technical Standards for admission, but it is discovered after matriculation that the student signed knowing they did not meet these minimum standards, then the student may receive sanctions up to and including dismissal from the program. 28 3.4 Non-Discrimination The CUSOM Office of Admissions makes every effort to recruit students with diverse backgrounds to foster the cultural richness to meet its Mission and Goals. CUSOM applicants will not be discri minated against on the basis of: race; orientation; gender or national origin; religion; disability; genetic information; protected veteran or military status; and any other characteristic protected by law, except where exemption is appropriate and allowed by law. 3.5 Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act CUSOM operates in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), and the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), both as amended, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to assure its facilities, programs and student policies are accessible to individuals with disabilities. Applicants and students with spe cific needs who request or are planning to request accommodation under the ADA should contact the Office of Student Affairs following the process describe d in Section 7.2.3 of this Bulletin . 3.6 Application Process Step 1: AAC OMAS Application CUSOM p articipates with other centraliz S ervice An application must be submitted online at https://choosedo.org . Detailed instructions can be accessed through and questions can be answered by contacting: AACOMAS aacomasinfo@liaisoncas.com Telephone: (617) 612-2889 To initi ate applic ants must apply dire ctly to AACOMAS. AACOM AS is available to the students for the entering class from May through March of the year applying. 29 Applicants must request all official transcripts from all colleges and universities attended to be mailed directly from the institution(s) to the AACOMAS office. Students should also ensure all MCAT scores are forwarded directly to AACOMAS from the AAMC. Applicants who have taken course work and/or have earned a degree from a foreign institution must also submit to AACOMAS an evaluation of their transcripts in a course -by-course fashion from one of the AACOMAS -approved evaluation services. The evaluation service must verify course work completed at an instituti on outside of the US is comparable to a regionally accredited US college or university in a course -by-course fashion. Step 2: CUSOM Secondary Ap plication Process After receipt of the AACOMAS application, CUSOM performs an initial screening of the application. Applicants determined to be eligible for a Secondary Application based on criteria established by the CUSOM Admissions Committee, may be invited to submit a Secondary Application and supporting documents. Please note CUSOM screens all primary applications, and not all applicants will receive an invitation to submit a Secondary Application. Applicants invited to submit a Secondary Application will receive an email notification. This email will contain information and instructions on how to complete the Secondary Application and submit the processing fee. A non - refundable fee of $50.00 is payable upon submission of the Secondary Application for adm ission. CU SOM w aives this fee if the applic ant has an approved AACOMAS f ee waiver document. In addition to the Se condary Applic ation and non -refund able proc essing fe e or AACOMAS fee waiver , applicants must submit two requir ed lette rs of recomm endation. Letters of recommendation must be origin als on pro fession al or college/university lette rhead and sign ed by the evaluator. L etters of recomm endation may not be written by a r elative, in cluding relatives through marriage. CUSOM accepts lette rs through A ACOM AS, Inter folio and mail. Letters of recommendation which are included as a part of a pre-health committee packet or letters from an official evaluation collection service (AACOMAS or Interfolio) recognized by CUSOM as a part of their official application packet and are accepted without signature or letterhead, as long as the letters are sent directly from the authors to the pre -health committee. If the applicant's school does not utilize a pre -health committee, a letter must be from a science PhD faculty member familiar with the academic work of the applicant. A second letter of recommendation must be from either an osteopathic physician (DO) or an allopathic physician (MD). Although a letter from an osteopathic physician is not required, it is strongly recommende d. 30 While shadowing experience with a DO is not required, applicants who have shadowing experience with an osteopathic physician demonstrate commitment to the profession and understanding of the practice of osteopathic medicine. CUSOM welcomes additional letters of support or recommendation from those who are acquainted with the student's academic or professional ability. All additional letters of recommendation must be originals on professional or college/university letterhead, signed by the evaluator, a nd sent directly to the CUSOM Office of Admissions. 3.7 Applications Deadline The of ficial AACOMAS application is available online at: https://choosedo.org The d eadline for CUSOM applicants is March 1 , but this deadline is subj ect to change annually. Applic ants should consult the CUSOM w ebsite for more information. The last day for applic ants to submit their S econdary Application and supporting materi als is March 15 , but an earlier submission is highly encourag ed. 3.8 CUSOM Selection Process To be considered for an interview, each applicant must meet all the preceding admissions requirements and Technical Standards for admission and have a complete application file, including the AACOMAS application, a Secondary Application, proof of US Citize nship or Permanent US Residency (Passport, Green Card or Certificate of Naturalization), a letter of recommendation from either an osteopathic or allopathic physician, a recommendation form/letter from a pre -medical or pre -health committee or science PhD f aculty member and the processing fee or AACOMAS fee waiver. Additional information may be required by CUSOM as necessary. After receipt of all required materials, the applicant's file is reviewed by the Office of Admissions to determine eligibility for an interview based on criteria established by the CUSOM Admissions Committee. The applicant will interview with members of the CUSOM faculty, staff, and administration. During the interview, the applicant's academic history and knowledge may be reviewed as well as the attributes which demonstrate the ir potential to become a caring an d compet ent osteop athic physici an and fit for CUSOM 's Mission . At the conclusion of the int erviews, the int erviewers submit their re comm endation through WebAdMIT for review by the Dire ctor of Admissions, and these recomm endations are pres ented and discussed during an Admissions Committ ee meeting. The Admissions Committee reviews each applicant who interviews with CUSOM and makes a recommendation to the Dean to either \" Accept\" or \" Deny\" admission . 31 The Dean, as the Chief Academic Officer, or the Dean's designee, makes final decisions on candidate st atus. This decision is provided to the applicant in a timely manner, by email notification typically within 2 -4 weeks of the interview date. Intentional misr epresentation or omission of info rmation on any form or record relev ant to admission requirements subje cts the applicant to a retra ction of an offer for admission, or dismiss al of the student in the case the misr epresentation/omission is discov ered after matriculation. CUSOM reserves the right to deny admission to any applicant for any lawful reason it deems appropriate. Matriculation may be denied to applicants who have failed to maintain a good record of scholastic performance or good record of personal conduct between the time of their acceptance and their m atriculation at CUSOM. In addition, re -admission may be denied to students returning from an approved Leave of Absence if they have failed to maintain a good record of scholastic performance or good record of personal conduct between the time of the beginning of their leave of absence and sched uled date of return. An offer of acceptance may be rescinded should an accepted applicant NOT meet the Technical Standards and Vaccination Requirements for Admission to CUSOM . For matriculated students, inability to maintain compliance with educational training Technical Standards including vaccinations may result in Dismissal from the program. Addi tionally, applicants found to h ave screening tests posit ive for alcohol, pres cription ch are illeg al in the state of North Carolina may result in revocation of an offer of acceptan ce or dismissal from the program in the case that positive tests are discovered after matriculation. Controll ed subst ance screening results are view ed in light of North Caro lina and fed eral la ws governing illegal substan ces. For example, although the use of mariju ana is leg al in some stat es, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Ag ency lists it as an illeg al drug. Its use or abuse imp airs the ability of a healthcare prof ession al to provide optimal care to his or h er patients. As su ch, the use of ma rijuana in any form is a violation of Univ ersity policy. 3.9 Early Decision Admissions Track The Early Decision Admissions Track is an admissions option for candidates who identify CUSOM as their first choice for pursuing their medical education and earning their osteopathic or allopathic medical degree. To be considered for the Early Decision Admissions Track, an applicant must meet all of the following requirements and agree to apply only to CUSOM until an early decision notification has been made.

Students in the School of Osteopathic Medicine actively learn in an environment providing clinical training while integrating biomedical sciences with hands -on experiences using modern technology. Students in the E APM may be eligible to participate in specialized medically -related experiences during their und ergraduate years based on availability. These experiences may include: Shadowing physicians; Participating in inter -professional education events with other students who are pursuing degrees such as pharmacy, nursing, physician assistant, and physical therapy; Spending time in the student -led health clinic; Attending select medical school lectures and learning sessions during junior and senior years; or Participating in select medical simulations. Additional information concerning the Early Acceptance for Medicine Program may be found at: https://medicine.campbell.edu/admissions/osteopathic-medicine-admissions/early- acceptance-program/ Please note an offer to interview does not guarantee an offer of acceptance . 34 3.12 Transfer Applicants CUSOM may consider acceptance of transf er students ; however, CUSOM does not accept transfer students from international medical schools . Current students at another medical school applying for transfer to CUSOM must minimally submit the following to the Office of Admissions: a completed CUSOM Application for Transfer form ; certified and of ficial tr anscripts from all post-secondary educational institutions verifying passing grad es in all subj ects at the time of tr ansfer, and evidence of an overall 3.2 GPA or higher on a 4.0 s cale at th eir current m edical school. Each course is evaluated by the O ffice of A cademic Affairs as to course content, equival ency, and credit hours prior to any credit being transferred. Transfer stud ents le aving an a ccredited medi cal school must r equest a letter f rom the Dean, and another letter from at least one Asso ciate D ean, from all prior medi cal schools attend ed. Students who h ave compl eted two ye ars of course wo rk at another medi cal school will not be consid ered for transfer if they h ave not p assed COMLEX -USA L evel 1. Transfer credit will be d ependent on coursework compl eted by the applicant and acceptance of any credits for transfer will be subj ect to the fin al approval by the CUSOM Dean based on the re comm endations of an ad hoc subcommittee of the CUSOM Admissions Committ ee. Credits are only transferrable from osteopathic medical schools accredited by the American Ost eopathic Asso ciation's Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) , or from schools of medicine accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). An ad hoc committee appointed by the Dean conducts an evaluation of courses for transfer . Students applying for transfer from another medi cal school to CUSOM will be requir ed to compl ete at least the last two y ears at CUSOM prior to gradu ation. In addition, all students applying for transfer must meet the CUSOM requir ement s for osteop athic manipulative medi cine, including the demonstration of the requisite knowl edge and application of osteop athic philosophy , prior to gr aduation. All materials submitted by applicants applying for transfer will be review ed by the Admissions Commi ttee, and the applicant may be granted an opportunity to interview by the Admissions Committee prior to the approval of a transf er. CUSOM h as the right to require additional courses to be taken , or clinical rotations added , if deemed necessary to ensure the graduates are of the high est quality and contribute to CUSOM su ccessfully m eeting its Mission . The D ean determines satisfactory compl etion of these requir ements. Students must ful fill all requirements for gr aduation, including p assing COMLEX -USA COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE* licensing examinations within designated parameters delineated elsewhere in this Bulletin , to be awarded the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree from CUSOM. 35 * NOTE: COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE was suspended indefinitely in February 2021, and formally discontinued in June 2022. COMLEX -USA candidates are currently verified by attestation from their COM dean that they are proficient in these important clinical skills. Additional information is available on the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE website . As such, to be eligible to graduate, each student must have successfully completed CUSOM's Clinical Skills Assessment Program, which includes both a longitudinal assessment of student performance and an on -campus multi -station Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE) during the fourth year. This multi -station OSCE, also called the Physical Exam -Qualifying Exam (PE -QE), requires students to demonstrate successfully the fundamental clinical skills and physician -related competency domains required for gradua tion, entrance into supervised graduate medical education programs, and the provision of safe osteopathic medical care of patients. 3.13 Transfers from Accredited Schools of Medicine Credits are only transferrable from osteopathic medical schools accredited by the American Ost eopathic Asso ciation's Commission on Ost eopathic Coll ege Accreditation (COCA) , or from s chools of medi cine accredited by on M edical Edu cation for transfer must h ave compl eted all course wo rk with p assing gr ades at the time of the transfer request and have at least a 3.2 or greater GPA on a 4.0 s cale for schools which utilize a numeric grading scale . Each course is evaluated by the O ffice of A cademic Affairs as to course content, equival ency, and credit hours prior to any credit being transferred. Transferred credits are only accepted if the student is eligible for readmission to a previously attended COCA -accredited COM or LCME -accredited school of medicine or is currently an oste opathic medical student or allopathic medical student with overall good standing at the institution from which they are seeking transfer. Letters from the Dean and Associate Dean(s) of the previously attended medical school(s) are required to verify the s tudent is in good standing and is eligible for readmission to their institution. Students applying for transfer from LCME -accredited medical schools must complete the CUSOM requirement s for osteopathic manipulative medicine , including the demonstration of the requisite knowledge and application of osteopathic philosophy prior to graduation. 36 Students who h ave compl eted two ye ars of course wo rk at another medi cal school will not be consid ered for transfer if they h ave not p assed COMLEX -USA L evel 1. The Dean, as the Chief Academic Officer, or the Dean's designee, makes final decisions on transfer requests. CUSOM does not a ccept transfer students from international medical schools. 3.14 International Student Applicants CUSOM may accept students who are US -born citizens, naturalized citizens, and green card holders. Applicants must understand that clearance for the permission to participate in clinical training at affiliated sites is determined by the site, not by CUSOM. Certain sites have more time -consuming clearance processes, such as Veterans Administration hospitals and other federal facilities. CUSOM cannot guarantee clearance for the permission to participate in clinical training at a specific site , or at any sit e if none accept the student, but will work to place students at the necessary sites to complete their educational requirements. In addition, eligibility to participate in graduate medical education is determined by the individual residency program, not b y CUSOM. As such, international students accepted into the CUSOM DO Program may not necessarily be guaranteed clinical rotation slots at affiliated locations, or obtaining residency placement, since both are beyond the control of CUSOM. As noted in Section 3.8 of this Bulletin, applicants who have taken course work and/or have earned a degree from a foreign institution must also submit to AACOMAS an evaluation of their transcripts in a course -by-course fashion from one of the AACOMAS -approved evaluation services. The evaluation service must verify course work completed at an institution outside of the US is comparable to a regionally accredited US college or university in a course -by-course fashion. 3.15 Juris Do ctor and Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (JD/DO) Dual Degree Program The Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine and the Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law offer a six -year combined program of study (JD/DO Dual Degree Program) leading to awarding of both the Juris Doctor (JD) degree and the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree upon successful completion of all requirements. One significant benefit of the combined program is the opportunity for students to complete the program in six years, thereby reducing the amou nt of time it would otherwise take to earn these two degrees separately by one calendar year. Graduates will be poised to obtain significant positions of leadership, administration, and management and will be well equipped to serve as leaders in their pro fessional and civic communities, working to make significant contributions at the intersection of law and medicine. 37 While Campbell JD/DO graduates will most likely practice in just one of the professions, their studies will provide them with exceptional insights into today's complex medico -legal issues. This program is rigorous and demanding and enrollment will be limited to those students meeting the criteria for both Campbell University School of Law and Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medic ine Admissions Standards. Students admitted to the JD/DO program complete both degree s in six years , beginning their studies in the Campbell University School of Law. During the first year, the student would begin law school studies during the Summer Semester followed by law school classes in fall, spring , and summer semesters. During the second year of the combined program, the student would b egin medi cal studi es at the Campbell Univ ersity S chool of Ost eopathic M edicine and compl ete two years in medi cal studi es before returning to the law school. As a du al degree progr am, it is import ant to note that both the law s chool and the medi cal school are accredit ed. North Carolina has six American Bar Association ( ABA )-accredit ed law schools: 1. Campbell Duke ersity 3. Elon Univ North Ca rolina Central University 5. Univ ersity of North Ca rolina Chapel Hill 6. Wake Forest Uni versity North Carolina has five Liaison Commi ttee on M edical Edu of North Ca (LCME-accredited) 5. Wake Forest Uni versity (LCME-accredited) CUSOM is the only osteop athic medi cal school in No rth Carolina, and the JD/DO progr am is unique. In North C arolina, at the time of this Bull etin only Duke University has a simil ar dual-degree progr am. In the United Stat es, the only other osteop athic medi cal school with a simil ar joint d egree progr am is Row an Univ ersity in New J ersey. Applicants to the JD/DO Dual Degree program must first apply to both degree programs individually in the same academic year and meet all admission requirements outl ined for both the Campbell University Juris Doctor (JD) and the Campbell University Doctor 38 of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) programs. The application deadline for the JD/DO Dual Degree program is November 15 . Applicants must be new applicants to and have accepted offers of admission from both degree programs to be eligible for review and acceptance into the JD/DO Dual Degree program. Acceptance into the JD and DO degree programs individually does not guarantee acceptance into the JD/DO Dual Degree program . The admissions process for the JD/DO Dual Degree program begins with applicants submitting a written request to both the law and medicine programs indicating their interest in pursuing and matriculating into the JD/DO Dual Degree program. Only applican ts who were offered admission into the DO and the JD programs (in the same academic year), and who have formally accepted these offers, will be reviewed by the Dual Degree Program Committee for admission to the JD/DO Dual Degree program. Applicants will u ndergo an additional committee interview to discuss additional supplemental application material for the JD/DO Dual Degree program . Moreover, this interview will be open file and may include documents from the applicant's AACOMAS, Secondary Application, a nd additional s upplemental application materials for the DO school .

Verification that all vaccination requirements are fully met or in progress is required by July 1. Accepted students who have not verified vaccination requirements are fully met or in progress by July 1 prior to matriculation may have their offer of admission rescinded . Students who have their offer of admission rescinded will forfeit their seat in the class and their deposit will not be refunded. All vaccination requirements th at are in -progress at the time of matriculation must be completed according to the recommended schedule. All deposited CUSOM students are required to submit the following to the Office of Cl inical Affairs: 1. Compl eted medical history form 2. Proof of all CUSOM vaccination requirements either met or in progress by July 1 3. Completed controlled substance screen (described below) 4. Completed physical examination condu cted by a licensed physician 5. Proof of health insurance Students must obtain all CUSOM -required vaccinations and corresponding titers, prior to matriculation and remain compliant with all vaccination requirements through graduation in order to complete all required supervised clinical practice experiences in the CUSOM curriculum. Regulatory and legislative authorities require students to demonstrate vaccination , immunity and/or protection from multiple communicable diseases before being allowed to participate in clinical experiences. CUSOM requires students to meet all vaccination requirements prior to matriculation and maintain compliance with these requirements through graduation. Descriptions of CUSOM vaccinatio n requirements specifically addressing Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Varicella, Hepatitis B, Influenza, and COVID -19 and testing for Tuberculosis are presented below. All incoming and current students must log all vaccination requirements on the standard AAMC Standard Immunization Form, available at: https://www.aamc.org/download/440110/data/immunizationform.pdf 40 This form must be completed in its entirety and signed by a physician or qualified healthcare provider verifying the required information. In addition, students are required to submit supporting documentation including vaccination records and titers. Important Notes Regarding Vaccination Requirements Accepting an offer of admission to CUSOM will require the incoming student to adhere to any mandates imposed by the University at a later date; acceptance of the offer of admission is indirect affirmation the incoming student both understands this point and accepts this as a condition of acceptance. All students must maintain full compliance with the requirements of CUSOM's vaccination policy i n order to participate in any patient care activities sponsored by, or affiliated with , CUSOM . Incoming student s must weigh these facts in considering acceptance of an offer of admission to CUSOM. In addition, the influenza vaccine is required annually and before placement in a clinical rotation. COVID -19 vaccination requirements will follow the Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) guidelines or as specified by clinical education partners and may require boosters annually or at other designated intervals. o Clinical experiences are part of the core curriculum to obtain the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree, and, therefore, CUSOM does not waive vaccination or student health requirements for religious or personal preferences except as set forth herein . o Camp bell University currently provides incoming accepted students the op portunity to request a medical or religious exemption for the COVID -19 vaccine through the following process: Students who seek a medical or religious exemption to the COVID -19 vaccination requirement should contact the Vice President for Student Life and Christian Mission , who chairs the Exemption Review Panel, at : 910-893-1541 or vaxexemption@campbell.edu . o The granting of an exemption to the COVID -19 requirement does not guarantee that a clinical training partner will honor the exemption. Campbell University cannot guarantee clinical placement for any student who does not comply with all vaccination require ments, even if the student has a religious or medical exemption granted by the University. o Campbell University does not have authority or control over a clinical site's decisions. Therefore, an exemption granted under Campbell University's policies may no t be applicable and accepted by a third -party clinical site. Even if a student is granted an exemption from vaccination requirements by the University, failure to provide proof of vaccinations for clinical experiences as required by external agencies may limit their clinical training opportunities 41 and prevent or delay completion of academic requirements and graduation. Any expenses required by a clinical site for testing are the sole responsibility of the student. o If a student does receive an exemption, t his does not create a prioritization in clinical placements. Standard placement processes will be utilized without consideration of waiver status. o If a student does not receive a clinical rotation placement as a result of an external clinical site's refus al to allow placement of a student who has not obtained all required vaccinations, the student will not be entitled to a refund of tuition or other relief from Campbell University. Unless granted an exemption, s tudents will not be allowed to participate in any patient care activities, including, but not limited to, early clinical experiences, activities with standardized patients, health outreach events, local, regional, national , or international mission trips, and clinical rot ations, until all vaccination requirements have been met. Inability to participate in required clinical experiences due to noncompliance with CUSOM vaccination policies may result in unexcused absences leading to failure of a course, referral to the Academ ic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee, Academic Probation, Suspension, delay in graduation, or even Dismissal from the program. Students must obtain all CUSOM -required vaccinations and corresponding titers prior to matriculation and remain compliant with all vaccination requirements through graduation in order to complete all required supervised clinical practice experiences in the CUSOM curriculum. Unless granted an exemption, n on-compliance with CUSOM Vaccination Requirements will result in referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee . In addition, noncompliance with requirements may result in the inability to participate in any clinical experiences, including, but not limited to, standardized patient OSCEs, early clinical experiences, and clinical rotations. This may result in unexcused absences leading to failure of a course or clin ical rotation(s), additional referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee, Academic Probation, Suspension, delay in graduation, or even Dismissal from the program. All students must provide written documentation utilizing the AAMC Standardized Immunization Form (completed and signed by their healthcare provider or institutional representative ): https://www.aamc.org/media/23441/download verifying all CUSOM -required vaccination and titer requirements (completed or in progress) , as listed below, and in accordance with the CDC Guidelines 42 (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults /rec-vac/hcw.html ), have been met for the following: Diphtheria, Pertussis and Tetanus a. All students must submit documentation (physician signature or vaccination record) of vaccination with a *Tdap booster (Boostrix\u00ae or Adacel\u00ae) since the year 2005. i. *Tdap is the one -time booster containing the acellular pertussis vaccine and is available only in the Boostrix\u00ae or Adacel\u00ae vaccines. ii. Following the Tdap booster, a Td routine booster is required every ten (10) years. b. This information should be entered into the \"Tetanus -diphtheria - pertussis\" section of the MMR: Measles (Rubeola), Mumps, and Rubella a. Students must provide dates and verification (physician signature or vaccination record) o f two (2) MMR vaccinations, occurring at least 28 days apart. i. If the student is able to provide a vaccination record or physician signature verifying the dates of these two (2) vaccinations, no titer will be required . b. Students unable to provide vaccination records or physician signature verifying completion of the MMR series have two (2) options: i. Repeat the MMR series o f two (2) vaccinations at least 28 days apart and provide documentation verifying completion of the series. ii. Obtain titers for measles, mumps , and rubella. 1. If a student elects to obtain titers and they show evidence of non - immunity to any of the three (3) components of the vaccine (measles, mumps, or rubella), they will be required to repeat the MMR series of two (2) vaccinations at least 28 da ys apart. The exception is if there is only non -immunity to Rubella, only one additional MMR vaccination will be required. c. This information should be entered into the \"MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella)\" section of the AAMC Standard Immunization Form. Varicella a. Students must provide antibody titers as evidence of immunity to Varicella . b. If antibody titers demonstrate a student is not immune to Varicella, they must receive two (2) doses of the varicella vaccine administered four (4) weeks apart. c. This info rmation should be entered into the \"Varicella\" section of the AAMC Standard Immunization Form . 43 Hepatitis B Vaccination a. Students must provide dates and verification ( physician signature or vaccination record) of completing a Hepatitis B vaccination series consisting of either: i. A three (3) dose series of either the Engerix -B or Recombivax HB. Injections of these vaccines are generally given at 0, 1, and 6 months which means injection two would be given 1 month following injection one, and injection three wo uld be given 6 months following injection one. ii. Two-dose series of Heplisav -B\u00ae with the doses separated by at least four (4) weeks. b. A quantitative antibody titer is then performed 4 -8 weeks following the final dose in the series. Qualitative results cannot be accepted . c. While students may not have completed the entire series at the time of matriculation, all students must have at least received their first injection and be in the process of completing the subsequent injection(s) and titer following the above schedule. d. In addition, all students must provide verification of quantitative antibody titers demonstrating immunity to Hepatitis B. To ensure accuracy, it is recommended antibody titer testing be performed 4 -8 weeks following the final dose in the serie s. e. Students who do not demonstrate immunity through adequate titer levels i. Students who have received the initial series of Hepatitis B vaccine (3-doses if Engerix -B or Recombivax HB or Heplisav - B\u00ae) and do not seroconvert to demonstrate immunity will be required to repeat the complete series of vaccination s. ii. Following completion of the repeat series of Hepatitis B vaccinations, students must obtain another quantitative titer to confirm immunity. To ensure accuracy, it is recommended that antibody titer testing be performed 4 -8 weeks following the final dose in the series. iii. Students who still do not demonstrate immunity following the second Hepatitis B vaccination series will be considered a vaccine non-responder and at risk for acquiring Hepatitis B Virus (HBV). iv. Students who do not attain immunity following completion of a second Hepatitis B vaccination series will also be required to obtain testing for active Hepatitis B infection . Please see the information below under Hepatitis B testing for fur ther details. f. If testing for Hepatitis B infection is negative, the student will be considered non-immune to Hepatitis B and will meet with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Current recommendations and additional education on universal precautions, risk avoidance, and treatment options if exposed to HBV will be provided to the student. The student will sign documentation of informed consent to continue their education, acknowledging the medical risk and receipt of this 44 information, but they will not be required to continue additional HBV vaccination s. Hepatitis B Testing a. Per CDC guidelines, any studen t who does not obtain protective immunity as demonstrated by quantitative titers to Hepatitis B after a completion of two (2) vaccination series (for a total of six (6) vaccination s with either Engerix -B or Recombivax HB or a total of four (4) vaccination s with Heplisav -B\u00ae) will be required to obtain serologic testing for Hepatitis B infection as described below. Qualitative results cannot be accepted . b. Students who attain protective immunity to Hepatitis B after either the first or second vaccination series are considered immune, protected, and free of Hepatitis B and, therefore, do not require testing for the disease . c. Testing for Hepatitis B is accomplished through evaluation of serum HBsAg (Hepatitis B Surface Antigen) and anti-HBc (Total Hepatitis B core antibody). i. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is a protein on the surface of HBV; it can be detected in high level s in serum during acute or chronic HBV infection. The presence of HBsAg indicates the person is infectious. The body normally produces antibodies to HBsAg as part of the normal immune response to infection. HBsAg is the antigen used to make Hepatitis B vaccine. ii. Total Hepatitis B core antibody (anti -HBc) appears at the onset of symptoms in acute Hepatitis B and persists for life. The presence of anti-HBc indicates previous or ongoing infection with HBV of an undefined time frame. iii. Students who are require d to obtain Hepatitis B testing must provide results of both HBsAg and anti -HBc to CUSOM along with the confirmatory lab reports. Students Testing Positive for Hepatitis B a. Results of Hepatitis B testing will not affect a student's matriculation status or o ffer of acceptance but provide valuable information to ensure proper student and patient care safeguards and adherence to CDC recommendations for the management of Hepatitis B virus -infected healthcare providers and students are followed. In addition, tes ting prior to matriculation provides documentation of baseline infection status in the event a student has an exposure incident during subsequent clinical activities. i. While the presence of a chronic disease does not affect admission to CUSOM, student participation in clinical training is subject to the policies of the affiliated private hospitals and other healthcare facilities where students train. 45 b. As noted by the CDC guidelines, HBV infection alone does not disqualify infected persons from the practi ce or study of medicine. However, in order to promote and optimize both infected student and patient safety, CUSOM has adopted the following set of guidelines for students found to be infected with HBV. c. Students who test positive for Hepatitis B/show evid ence of Chronic Active Hepatitis B will be required to have a complete evaluation by an Infectious Disease physician or Gastroenterologist to evaluate the student's clinical and viral burden status and make recommendations regarding treatment and any appro priate limitation to participation in specific procedures or patient care activities. The consulting physician should provide the following information to the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs: i. A summary of the complete evaluation including any addition al testing deemed appropriate to define and further evaluate the student's Hepatitis B infection and impact on their health. This should include, but is not limited to, HBV DNA levels (serve as a predictive indicator of infectivity). 1. The CDC recommends th at an HBV level 1,000 IU/ml (5,000 GE/ml) or its equivalent is an appropriate threshold for a reviewing physician or panel to adopt. ii. Details of any treatment are recommended. iii. A recommendation regarding the student's ability to participate in patient care including any restriction from specific procedures or patient care activities (Based on Category I or Category II Procedures). iv. Coordination with the student's primary care physician (PCP) for ongoing care and establishment of appropriate follow up which must include at least an annual exam. v. Complete the CUSOM Hepatitis B Information Form (Appendix 1) documenting the above information and submit it to the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. 1. The consultation must be completed and the CUSOM Hepatitis B Inform ation Form received by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs before the student is permitted to begin clinical rotations or participate in any other patient care activities, including , but not limited to , activities with standardized patients, the CUCCC, community medicine outreach activities, or medical mission trips. Students will not be able to participate in clinical rotations or other patient care activities until this is completed. 2. A student testing positive for Hepatitis B is required t o complete a follow up visit with the consulting specialist (or primary care physician upon recommendation of the consulting specialist) once every 12 months or sooner based on the specialist's recommendation. Additionally, another CUSOM Hepatitis B Infor mation Form must be completed and submitted to the 46 Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs prior to the start of fourth - year clinical rotations. 3. Notification of Student Hepatitis B Status Per CDC guidelines, routine notification of patients regarding student H BV status is not indicated unless the provider exposes the patient to a blood -borne infection. To ensure HBV -infected students are following all institutional policies regarding the provision of care by infected providers, the Director of Student Medical Education (DSME), or equivalent, and preceptor will be notified of the students HBV infection prior to the rotation as well as the recommendations of the consulting specialist regarding any suggested restriction from patient care activities. 4. Modification of Plan of Study for Students with Chronic Hepatitis B Infection Students who are cleared by the evaluating specialist to participate in unrestricted patient care will have no modification of their clinical education or rotation experience unless mandated by their specific clinical site. Students who are restricted from performing specific clinical procedures (Category I) by the evaluating specialist or clinical site may have their educational curriculum or rotation experience modified as needed. This may in clude the substitution of simulation -based aids or cadaveric models to provide equivalent procedural experiences. Any requirement to modify student procedural experiences based on consultant or clinical site recommendations will not adversely affect a stud ent's grade as the student will be evaluated utilizing one of the alternative methods noted above. The choice for alternative educational/procedural experiences will be determined in consultation with the discipline clinical chairs, discipline preceptors, and regional deans/DSMEs on each campus. 5. Additional guidelines and information regarding students with Chronic Hepatitis B Infection Standard Precautions All students, including those with HBV infection, must maintain strict adherence to the tenants to standard (universal) infection control precautions. Students with HBV infection are encouraged to practice double -gloving, especially when participating in highly exposure -prone procedures, as this intervention has been shown to be efficacious in preventin g the spread of HBV infections. 47 Exposure -prone Procedures In general, exposure -prone procedures include those in which access for surgery is difficult, or those in which needle stick injuries are likely to occur, typically in very closed and non -visualized operating spaces in which double -gloving and the skin integrity of the operator might be compromised. Given the variety of procedures, practices, and providers, each HBV -infected healthcare provider performing a potentially exposure -prone procedure will n eed individual consideration. This will include a recommendation from an Infectious Disease specialist or Gastroenterologist who has evaluated the student along with guidance provided by individual hospital, healthcare system, and/or preceptor policies. Categorization of Clinical Procedures 1. Category I Procedures a. Those known or likely to pose an increased risk of percutaneous injury to a healthcare provider that have resulted in provider -to-patient transmission of HBV. b. Are generally limited to: i. Major abd ominal, cardiothoracic, and orthopedic surgery; ii. Repair of major traumatic injuries; iii. Abdominal and vaginal hysterectomy; iv. Caesarean section; v. Vaginal deliveries; or vi. Major oral or maxillofacial surgery. c. Techniques that have been demonstrated to increase the risk for healthcare provider percutaneous injury and provider -to-patient blood exposure include: i. Digital palpation of a needle tip in a body cavity; or ii. The simultaneous presence of a healthcare provide r's fingers and a needle or other sharp instrument or object (bone spicule) in a poorly visualized or highly confined anatomic site. d. Students with HBV infection may be restricted from performing Category I procedures based on recommendations from an Infect ious Disease specialist or based on hospital or preceptor policy. 2. Category II Procedures a. All other invasive and noninvasive procedures. b. Pose low or no risk for percutaneous injury to a healthcare provider or, if a percutaneous injury 48 occurs, it usually hap pens outside a patient's body and generally does not pose a risk for provider -to- patient blood exposure. c. Procedures include the following: i. Surgical and obstetrical procedures that do not involve the techniques listed for Category I; ii. The use of needles or o ther sharp devices when the healthcare provider's hands are outside a body cavity (e.g., phlebotomy, placing and maintaining peripheral and central intravascular lines, administering medication by injection, performing needle biopsies, or lumbar puncture); iii. Dental procedures other than major oral or maxillofacial surgery; iv. Insertion of tubes (e.g., catheters); v. Endoscopic or bronchoscopic procedures; vi. Internal examination with a gloved hand that does not involve the use of sharp devices (e.g., vaginal, oral, and rectal exam); or vii. Procedures that involve external physical touch (e.g., general physical or eye examinations or blood pressure checks). d. Students with HBV infection are generally not restricted from performing Category II procedures. Tuberculosis (TB) Testing a. Baseline TB screening/testing is required for all medical students prior to matriculation and again prior to each year of clinical rotations. b. There are two (2) acceptable methods for TB screening, and all students must provide documentation of the results from ONE of the two methods : i. Two-step tuberculin skin test (TST); or ii. Interferon -Gamma (IGRA) blood test TB Gold In -Tube Test or T -spot TB Test). If the initial TB screening is d one with the Tuberculin Skin Test (TST), the student must have the Two -Step Method at baseline (described below) followed by a single -step annually . If the blood test (Interferon -Gamma Release Assay or IGRA) is used at initial screening for baseline measures, a two-step process is not required . Students should speak with their physician to determine which test is most appropriate for them. 49 c. Optio n 1: The Mantoux Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) i. The Mantoux TST is the standard method of determining whether a person has been exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis . The TST is performed by injecting 0.1 ml of tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) into the anterior surface of the forearm. The skin test reaction should be read between 48 and 72 hours after administration. If the test is not read between 48 and 72 hours after being placed, the student will need to be rescheduled for another skin test. ii. Two -Step Method: If TST is utilized as the TB screening test, the \"two -step method\" is required . iii. Test interpretation 1. If the first TST result in the two -step baseline testing is positive, the person is considered infected and should be evaluated and treated accordingly. 2. If the first test result is negative, the TST should be repeated in 1-3 weeks . 3. If the second test result is positive, the person is considered infected and should be evaluated and treated accordingly. 4. If both steps are negative, the person is considered uninfected, and classif ies the TST as negative at baseline testing. iv. Note: Two -step Method is only used at the initial screening for a baseline me asure - annual testing thereafter only requires a single PPD. v. When IGRAs are used for testing, there is no need for a second test. vi. Summary of 2 -step TST testing is provided in the following table: 1st TST Test Negative Repeat TST in 1 -3 weeks Positive Considered positive for infection* 2nd TST Test Negative Person probably does not have an infection Single PPD required annually moving forward Positive Considered positive for infection* * It is recommended that any student who has received bacille Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), a vaccine for TB disease, undergo IGRA, rather than TST testing. If a student who has previously received BCG undergoes TST testing and obtains a positive result, they should be tested using an IGRA . d. Option 2: Interferon -Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs) Blood Test i. TB blood tests (interferon -gamma release assays or IGRAs) measure how the immune system reacts to the bacteria that cause TB. Two IGRAs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are available in the United States: 1. QuantiFERON\u00ae-TB Gold In -Tube test (QFT -GIT) 2. T-SPOT\u00ae.TB test (T -Spot) 50 ii. IGRAs are the preferred method of TB infection testing for anyone who has received bacille Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) . BCG is a vaccine disease. iii. Results of IGRAs 1. Positive IGRA : This means that the person has been infected with TB bacteria. Additional tests, including a chest X -ray, are needed to determine if the person has latent TB infection or active TB disease. 2. Negative IGRA : This means that the per son's blood did not react to the test, and that latent TB infection or TB disease is not likely. e. Special Situations - Prior BCG Vaccination and Pregnancy i. Testing for TB in BCG -Vaccinated Persons : 1. Many people born outside of the United States have been BCG - vaccinated. People who have had a previous BCG vaccine may receive a TB skin test. In some people, BCG may cause a positive skin test when they are not infected with TB bacteria. If a TB skin test is positive, additional tests are needed. IGRAs, unlike the TB skin tests, are not affected by prior BCG vaccination and are not expected to give a false -positive result in people who have received BCG. 2. Students who have had a previous BCG vaccine must still be tested for TB with the TST or IGRAs . 3. Most peo ple with previous BCG vaccine should consider an IGRA rather than a TST test; however, that decision should be made in consultation with their healthcare provider. ii. Pregnancy 1. Pregnancy is not a contraindication for TB skin testing. Pregnant students and st udents who are nursing should be included in the same baseline and serial TB screening as all other healthcare workers . IGRA blood tests are not currently used in pregnant women. iii. Medical Students with Positive TST or IGRA Testing 1. Students with WRITTEN documentation of a previous positive TST or TB Blood Test 2. If the date and result of the previous test are documented, these students do not need a repeat TST or TB blood test. 3. If they have written documentation of the results of a chest X - ray indic ating no active TB disease that is dated after the date of the positive TST or TB blood result, they do not need another chest X -ray unless symptoms or signs of TB disease develop , or a clinician recommends a repeat chest X -ray. 4. These students do not requi re annual TST or IGRA testing but must complete the TB Risk Assessment Form (Appendix 2) annually , have it signed by a physician, and return it to the Office of Clinical Affairs. 51 5. If the student does not have written documentation of a chest radiograph, they must obtain a chest X -ray prior to matriculation to exclude a diagnosis of infectious TB. The results/interpretation of this chest X -ray must be submitted to the Office of Clinical Affairs. iv. Medical Students with a Newly Identified Positive TST or IGR A Blood Test 1. If a student tests positive with either screening test (TST or IGRA) any time following matriculation, t hey must immediately notify the Office of Clinical Affairs . 2. These individuals must be assessed by their physician for current TB symptoms a nd risk factors for progression to active TB disease. The physician must complete the \"Record of Tuberculosis Screening\" form and provide documentation indicating that the student is permitted to continue in the curriculum as a medical student including p articipation in lectures, labs, and clinical rotations. This documentation, along with documentation of the student's chest x -ray result as noted below, must be submitted to the Office of Clinical Affairs prior to the student returning to campus or participating in any clinical rotation experiences. 3. In addition, they must obtain a chest X -ray to exclude a diagnosis of ac tive infectious TB disease and submit this documentation to the Office of Clinical Affairs. v. Medical Students with Suspected or Confirmed Infectious TB 1. If infectious TB is confirmed, the student must not return to campus or participate in any third - or fourth -year clinical rotations or other clinical activities, including, but not limited to, the CUCCC, community outreach, or medical mission trips. A student confirmed to have infectious TB will only be able to return when all the following criteria have been met: Three consecutive sputum samples collected in 8 -24 hour intervals are negative with at least one sample from an early morning specimen; The person has responded to anti -TB treatment that will likely be effective (based on susceptibility results) ; The person is determined to be noninfectious by a physician knowledgeable and experienced in managing active TB disease 2. The student's treating physician must provide documentation to the Office of Clinical Affairs verifying each of these criteria have be en met and that the student can safely participate in clinical rotations. f. All required information regarding TB testing and treatment must be entered in the \"Tuberculin Screening History\" section of the AAMC Standard Immunization form . 52 Influenza a. All stu dents are required to provide the dates and verification (physician signature or vaccination record) of an annual influenza vaccination. b. Students will be required to resubmit verification annually and will not be allowed to participate in patient care activities without proof of vaccination. COVID -19 Campbell University policy requires all students enrolled in a healthcare program to be fully vaccinated against COVID -19. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of this disease , the requirements listed below are subject to change at any time to be consistent with recognized safe practices. a. COVID -19 vaccination requirements will follow CDC guidelines or as specified by clinical education partners and may require boosters annually or at other designated interval s. b. If additional COVID -19 vaccination requirements are implemented, they may have specific deadlines . c. Clinical experiences are part of the core curriculum to obtain the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree, and, therefore, CUSOM does not waive vaccination or student health requirements for rel igious , medical, or personal preferences , except as set forth herein. d. Campbell University currently provides students the opportunity to request a medical or religious exemption for the COVID -19 vaccine through the following process: i. Students who seek a medical or religious exemption to the COVID - 19 vaccination requirement should contact the Vice President for Student Life and Christian Mission , who chairs the Exemption Review Panel, at (910)-893-1541 or vaxexemption@campbell.edu . Optional Vaccines and Testing HIV Testing Although not required, CUSOM encourages all students to obtain HIV testing prior to matriculation . Testing prior to matriculation provides students with their baseline status regarding the presence of HIV infection which is valuable in the event a student has an exposure incident during subsequent clinical activities. Students are not required to report the results of their testing to CUSOM . Hepatitis C Testing To protect CUSOM students and patients, it is recommended that students obtain Hepatitis C testing and provide documentation of test results to the Office of Clinical Affairs prior to matriculation . 53 Results of Hepatitis C testing will not affect a student's matriculation status or offer of acceptance but will provide valuable information to en sure proper patient care safeguards and adherence to CDC recommendations for the management of Hepatitis C virus in infected healthcare providers and students are followed. In addition, testing prior to matriculation provides a baseline status regarding the presence of Hepatitis C infection which is valuable in the event a student has an exposure incident during subsequent clinical activities. Testing for Hepatitis C may be accomplished by several methods with the most common method utilized for initial s creening being the measurement of anti-HCV , which is a test to detect the presence of antibodies to the Hepatitis C virus. If anti -HCV tests are positive, students will be required to obtain additional confirmatory testing and medical follow up in accorda nce with CDC guidelines . Optional Vaccines The following vaccines are considered optional; however, CUSOM strongly advises all students to discuss the appropriateness of each of the following vaccinations with their primary care physician, taking into account their personal medical history, risk factors for contracting these diseases and potential for international travel. 1. Polio 2. Hepatitis A 3. Meningococcal Disease 4. Yellow Fever 5. Typhoid Fever Students who have obtained the above optional vaccinations should document the dates and provide verification (physician signature or vaccination records) and include them in the \"Additional Vaccines\" section of the AAMC Standard Immunization Form. Additional Information Regarding Immunization Requirements In some situations, clinical training sites may have additional vaccination requirements above those required by CUSOM. CUSOM does not waive vaccination or student health requirements for religious, medical, or personal preferences. CUSOM may revise the vaccination requirements at any time as deemed necessary, including those related to required laboratory evaluations and immunizations, are subject to re view and modification based on 54 recommendations from the CDC , the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPTF), and other public health agencies. Students will be notified of any changes and will be required to comply with any mandated changes upon receipt of notice from CUSOM. 3.16.2 National Background Checks If an applicant has been convicted of a misdemeanor or felony prior to admission or matriculation, it is their responsibility to inform CUSOM immediately . Failure to disclose and provide accurate information about prior convictions may result in rescinding of acceptance offers, program dismissal, or other sanctions. Applicants must b e aware of the potential impact on program acceptance and contact the CUSOM Office of Admissions for guidance if they have a felony conviction or a criminal record. I f an applicant is uncertain of the status of a charge versus a conviction on their record, or if they are uncertain as to whether the offense was an infraction, misdemeanor, or a felony, they should contact the city, county, or state jurisdiction where the incident occurred , and they should contact the CUSOM Office of Admissions . CUSOM applicants are required to self -disclose any charges, arrests or convictions including misdemeanors, felonies, a prayer for judgment continued, deferred adjudications, traffic violations, military non -judicial punishment, court martial, and general or less-than-honorable discharge from the military, (all hereinafter \"Offenses\") with the understanding that non -disclosure/falsification of any previous or pending Offenses may result in the revocation of the offer of admission. This includes, but is not lim ited to, the following: Any instance in which they were arrested but which did not result in a conviction ; Any instance in which they were convicted of a crime but the conviction was overturned on appeal ; Any instance in which they were convicted of a cri me but received a pardon ; Any instance in which they were tried as a juvenile or in which the conviction was entered via a court process specific to juvenile defendants ; or Any instance in which they were convicted of a crime but the conviction has since b een expunged or sealed by a court under applicable law If a student has any Offenses pending final adjudication at any time during the application process, at the time of matriculation, or following matriculation , it is the student's responsibility to imm ediately inform CUSOM. 55 Additionally, in response to requirements in the professional practice environment and to minimize the risk to patients, a background check will be completed on all accepted applicants prior to matriculation, and on any student whose actions could potentially be considered a risk to others at any time. Should any Offenses occur after matriculation, (1) the student must report the Offenses to the Office of Student Affairs within thirty (30) days of the incident, or (2) if Offense s occurring prior to matriculation are not reported to CUSOM at the time of application but are subsequently discovered following matriculation, the Offense will , pursuant to Section 6.7.5 of this Bulletin , be reviewed by the Academic Performance, Promotio n and Standards (APPS) Committee and may result in possible sanctions, up to, and including, dismissal from the program. A national background check may be performed at any time and is also done on each student prior to the start of clinical rotations . Students must be aware that results of any background check are shared with the clinical sites. By matriculating to CUSOM, the student agrees to allow CUSOM to share background check information in full with the student's respective clinical site(s) . Additional national background checks may be performed at the discretion of CUSOM or its partnering institutions before accepting a student into a clinical rotation. National background checks may be required at any time deemed appropriate by CUSOM. Disc overy of any previously non -reported Offense(s) may lead to referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee and possible sanctions, up to , and including , dismissal from the program. CUSOM has no control over the content of t hird-party background checks. Even expunged records may appear on these background checks. Background checks revealing prior Offenses, even charges which may have been dismissed by the courts, could still result in consequences affecting clinical rotatio ns, acceptance into residency programs, future licensing, specialty board certification, or employment opportunities. If a student is unable to complete clinical rotations due to the inability to pass background check requirements, they will not be capable of making academic progress or be able to meet graduation requirements. In addition, and as such, they will be refer red to the APPS Committee for possible sanctions, up to, and including, dismissal from the program. A student with any Offenses is encouraged to contact the licensure boards in the state of intended practice to ensure the aforementioned Offense will not i nhibit the ability to obtain a medical license upon graduation. 56 All current or former students returning from an approved extended period away from CUSOM, such as a Leave of Absence or an offer to repeat an academic year, must notify the Office of Student Affairs in writing of any Offenses, including any conduct which may be considered a violation of the Standards of Professional Conduct (Section 5.6.3 of this Bulletin ), Student Professionalism and Ethics Standards (Section 6.7.2 of this Bulletin ), Honor Code (Section 6.7.3 of this Bulletin ), or the Code of Conduct (Section 6.7.4 of this Bulletin ) no earlier than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the anticipated return date . For example, a student returning from a Medical Withdrawal on August 1, the Background Check and Controlled Substance Screen must be completed , and results provided to CUSOM , within a timeframe designated by CUSOM . An Offense occurring less than thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated return date must be reported to the Office of Student Affairs within 24 hours of the Offense. Non-disclosure or falsification of any information related to an Offense may result in the revocation of the offer to return to CUSOM, or if already returned to CUSOM, referral to the APPS Committee for p ossible sanctions up to, and including, dismissal from the program. CUSOM retains the right to relinquish the seat of any current or former student returning from an extended absence if they have been criminally charged or convicted of a misdemeanor, felo ny, or traffic violation. Students who have already resumed classes following an extended absence, who have been or are criminally charged or convicted of a misdemeanor, felony, or traffic violation will be referred to the APPS Committee for sanctions up to, and including, dismissal from the program. As future physicians, students are held to a high standard of professionalism, ethics , and honor, and CUSOM has a duty to protect the public from potential harm by its students. All current or former students returning from an approved period away from CUSOM including, but not limited to , a Leave of Absence or an offer to repeat an academic year, minimally must submit a completed Supplement al Application, national background check, and controlled subst ance screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM . Additional requirements, such as a psychiatric or medical evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. Students who do not return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulf ill all the requirements for return yet still wish to attend CUSOM , will have to re -apply through AACOMAS and will not be guaranteed re -admission. 3.16.3 Driver's Li cense As the clinical campus system of CUSOM is widespread across the states of North and South Carolina, all applicants must provide evidence of a valid driver's license to allow for travel to clinical rotations. Students may have to drive up to an hour from t he premier educational partner of their respective 57 regional site for an assigned rotation. Therefore, evidence of a valid driver's license must be provided to the Office of Student Affairs by the end of the first year of medical school. Failure to provid e evidence of a valid driver's license by the end of the first year of medical school may prevent the student from being promoted to the second year of medical school. Due to the potential need to travel for clinical rotations during the third and fourth year, all students must maintain a valid driver 's license through graduation. 3.16.4 Basic Life Support Skills CUSOM students are required to have Basic Life Support (BLS) training prior to matriculation and must maintain active certification through graduation. Each student must provide a copy of their American Heart Association CPR card, documenting current BLS for Healthcare Providers certification . CUSOM only accepts BLS for Healthcare Provider courses authorized by the American Heart Association. Failure to provide evidence of appropriate certification may result in revocation of an offer of acceptance. BLS certification must be maintained throu ghout a student's enrollment at CUSOM . Students who allow their certification to lapse will not be permitted to participate in any clinical experience, including third - and fourth year rotations . Students who are unable to participate in required clinica l rotations due to a lapse in their BLS certification will not be capable of completing curricular requirements or making academic progress and will be called to the APPS Committee according to the process prescribed in this Academic Bulletin. 3.16.5 Controlled Substance Screening In response to requirements in the professional practice environment and to minimize the risk to patients, a controlled substance screening must be completed by all accepted applicants prior to matriculation. This screening mus t meet CUSOM's standards and be conducted by an agency approved by CUSOM. Controlled substance screening results are viewed in light of state and federal laws governing illegal or controlled substances. If the controlled substance screening test result is positive ( i.e., evidence of a controlled substance) or shows other abnormalit ies including, but not limited to, excessively dilute urine, an ad hoc committee will be assigned to review the case. Depending on the recommendation of the ad hoc committee, the student's acceptance may be rescinded. For example, although the use of marijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to his or her patients. As such, the use of marijuana in any form is a violation of University policy. 58 By signing the Attestation confirming that students have read and acknowledge compliance with the precepts contained in th is Academ ic Bulletin, each applicant to CUSOM attests they are not currently using, and they will not use while a CUSOM student, any products or substances in any manner which are illegal in the state of North Carolina. A random controlled substance screening is r equired prior to starting clinical rotations, and all results are shared with the clinical sites. Additional screenings may be required, at any time, at the discretion of CUSOM or partnering - institutions. By matriculating to CUSOM, the student agrees t o allow CUSOM to share controlled substance screening results as deemed necessary. If either of the following events occur, the matter will be referred to the APPS Committee for review in accordance with Section 6.7.5 of this Bulletin : 1. Any substance-related incident which occurs b e f o r e o r after matriculation, includin g, but not limited to, charges/arrests for Driving Under the Influence or possession of a controlled substance , must be reported by the student to the CUSOM Office of Student Affairs within thirty (30) days of the o ccurrence. 2. If the controlled substance screening test result is positive ( i.e., evidence of a controlled substance) or shows other abnormalities including, but not limited to, excessively diluted urine . 3.16.6 Transcripts All CUSOM students are required to provide official transcripts from all colleges and universities attended if they have c ourse work which was not included or degree(s) not conferred with the transcripts submitted through AACOMAS. All transcripts are included in the student's original AACOMAS application so students are only required to provide CUSOM official transcripts from coursework completed and degree(s) conferred after the AACOMAS application was submitted. All students must submit all requir ed paperwork by the publish ed deadlines. Failure to submit info rmation could r esult in an offer of admission b eing rescinded. Falsification of any do cument or omission of any p ertinent information may result in dismiss al from the program if dis covered after matriculation. 59 4. Student Expenses and Financial Aid 4.1 Cost of Attendance 4.1.1 Secondary Application Fee A non-refundable fee of $50.00 is payable upon submission of the Secondary Application for admission. Details regarding fee submis sion are includ ed in the email invitation to submit a Secondary Application. CUSOM will waive this fee if the applicant has an approved AACOM AS fee waiver documen t. 4.1.2 Acceptance Fee Accepted students must submit a non -refundable deposit of $1,500.00 to CUSOM by the deadline designated in their offer of acceptance. Payment is credited tow ard tuition upon mat riculation. 4.1.3 Tuition and Fees Tuition is subject to chang e annually.

Campbell Univ ersity's Board of Trustees reserves the right to chang e the schedule of tu ition and fees without advance notice, and to make such change s applicable to p resent, as well as future students of CUSOM. The Board of Trustees may also establish additional fees or charges for special services whenever, in the Board of Trustee's opinion, such actions are deemed advisabl e. Students receiving federal aid or scholarships which have not arrived by the beginning of the acade mic year must have written assurance the funds are awarded. Students must pay any outs tanding tuition and fees. When those funds are distribut ed, any funds which exceed tuition and fees will be refunded. All inquiries concerning the above policies and all requests for refunds should be directed to the Campbell University Office of Financial Aid: CUSOMFinancialAid@Campbell.edu Student Fees Students in Years One through Four are assessed an annual student fee of $2,140. These fees are used to cover costs of laboratory equipment, compu ter softw are and mainten ance, activities, and h ealth services. The Campbell Univ ersity Board of Trustees reserves the right to change this fee schedule without notice. 60 4.1.4 Refund Policy Tuition and fees are refunded in accordance with the Campbell University Refund/Repayment Policy for Graduate and Professional Program s. To officially withdr aw from CUSOM, a student is required to complete an official withdrawal f orm available from CUSOM's Office of Student Affairs. The official form must be completed with prop er signatures obtai ned and turned in to the Office of Student Affairs . Once all signatures are obtain ed, the Office of Student Affairs provid es a copy to the Registrar for placement in the student 's permanent file. Upon the completion of the official withdrawal form and the receipt of said form in the CUSOM Office of the R egistrar, the student's class registration is updated as a withdrawal from the University denoting the \"Effective Date\". The Campbell University Bursar's Office verifies all classes have been updated accordingly and reassesses student tuition and fee charges. CUSOM students' tuition refunds are issued for a University Withdrawal (\"W\" status) in accordance with the schedule for Campbell University Refund/Repayment Policy f or Graduate and Professional Programs set forth in the link above . To be eligible for a University Withdrawal tuition refund, the student must withdraw from CUSOM and all classes are subsequently assigned a \"W\" status. Withdrawal tuition refunds will be based on the effective date of status change . The Campbell University Bursar's Office is responsible for the reassessment of student account charges and ensuring financial aid awards have been evaluated and reassessed accordingly. The Campbell University Bursar's Office reserves the right to hold refund of credit balances until they have evaluated and approved the release of funds awarded to students who withdraw from the University. Any student account balance resulting from a University withdrawal is the responsibility of the student and subject to the collections process. Students will not have grades entered on transcripts, or have transcripts available, if there is an outstanding balance owed the University. 4.2 Financial Aid Campbell University's Office of Financial Aid (Office of Financial Aid) makes every effort to ensure no qualified applicant is denied the opportunity to study medicine due to financial reasons. The financial aid program assists students in the form of institutional scholarships and student loans. The Office provides financial aid counseling to prospective applicants and to CUSOM graduates and beyond. 61 The Office of Financial Aid is responsible for the ad ministration of the student fin ancial aid program. Financial aid couns eling is provid ed to all prosp ective students as part of the applicant interview process. During each applicant interview session, a financial aid couns elor provid es a financial aid presentation . Personal financial aid couns eling is also a vailable to stud ents by appointment. The Office of Financial Aid will email all accep ted students information related to applying for financial aid. Students interested in applying for financial aid are required to complete the Free Applic ation for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), and the Statement of Financial Responsibility. Students must also provide any other document ation required by federal, state, and private financial assistance programs to determine eligibility for student financial assistance. Financial aid counseling is presented to incomin g students at the Financial Aid Entrance Interview Presentatio n during O rientation. Attendance at this financial aid presentation is mandatory for all students. During the presentation , federal entrance counseling requirements are discussed including aid eligibilit y calculations, borro wer rights and responsibilitie s, and loan informatio n. A review of the financial aid applicatio n process , loan disburse ments, billing pro cess, deferments, recor d keeping, and debt manage ment are also discussed. Students may meet individually with the financial aid counselor if th ey have sp ecific questions regardi ng their fin ancial aid package or if the coun selor requests a special meeting. The Office of Financial Aid provides perso nal couns eling upon request with students receiving financial aid throughout each academic year. CUSOM students are offered periodic updates regarding changes in financial aid regulations and application procedures. Such information is provided to students through their CUSOM email. Students are encouraged to call, email , or stop by the Office of F inancial Aid f or further individual assistance . The Office of Financial Aid also provid es Debt Management Couns eling sessions for medi cal students. These sessions include budgeting tips, respons ible borrowing strategies, loan t erms and conditions, default prevention, student loan d ebt in relation to month ly payme nt amounts and averag e physician salaries, deferm ent, forbearance, repayment and consol idation options, record keeping, and helpful websites for additional financial aid resources. Satisfactory Academic Performance (SAP) is one of the factors which determine if a student will qualify for renewal of financial aid. The SAP at CUSOM currently is set at a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.2 on a 4.0 s cale. The Office of Financial Aid coordinates Exit Couns eling sessions for any student who withdr aws or graduates from CUSOM. During these sessions, federal exit couns eling requirements are discuss ed including borrower rights and respons ibilities, instructions on how to access and interpret the National Student Loan Data System ( NSLDS), loan terms and conditions, d efault prevention, r epayment options and str ategies, consolidation, deferment, forbearance, record keeping and helpful websites for additional financial aid resources.

Campbell Univ ersity is consisten t in apply ing the SAP policie s to full- and part-time students. The cumulative GPA for achieving SAP for CUSO M is currently 2.2 on a 4.0 scale. Addit ional information regarding SAP and financial aid can be found on the Campbell Univ ersity F i n a n c i a l A i d P o l i c i e s website. In addition, should there be an outstanding balance at the end of the semest er, students will be placed on a Bursar's Office Hold and will not be registered for the following s emest er and are not eligible for financial aid unt il the Bursar's Office Hold is cleared. CUSOM and Campbell University advise students concerning financial aid requirements ; however, final responsibility rests with each individual student to ensure all financial aid requirements and due dates are met and are up-to- date. 4.3 Scholarships 4.3.1 Merit S cholarships CUSOM awards merit scholarships to a limited number of admitted students as an effort to recruit highly qualified medical students.

After the initial award notification letter, an e mail follow -up is sent to the student's Campbell email account, the award is canceled if the thank you letter is not turned in by the deadline date assigned by University Financial Aid Office . 4.3.4 Scholarship Renewal Criteria The Presidenti al, Dean's, and Campbell Univ ersity Scholarships may be renewed annually providi ng the student maintains a cumu lative CUSOM grade point average of 3.50 or above on a 4.0 scale for Presidenti al scholars, and 3.30 or above on a 4.0 scale for Dean's and Campbell Univ ersity scholars, at the end of each year of study. Cumu lative grade point averages are not rounded (e.g., a GPA of 3.49 or 3.29 will void a s cholarship). 69 Endowed and Direct Aid Scholarships are renewed annually if the recipient remains in good standing and continues to meet the award criteria . The Office of Financial Aid, in concert with the Office of the Registrar determines eligibility for renewal of scholarship awards on an annual basis. Medical Missions schola rships are non -renewable. Scholarship recipients must also abide by all aspects of the CUSOM Honor Code. Violat ions of the Honor Code may result in revocation of a scholarship. Students placed on acade mic or non -acade mic prob ation will be ineli gible for renewal of their CUSOM scholarship. If a scholarship is revoked, it will not be reinstated in subsequ ent years. 70 5. Curriculum 5.1 General Overview 5.1.1 Academic Calendar Academic calendars are made available to all students. Weekly schedules vary based on course content and space needs but are gene rally stru ctured so that lectures prim arily take place in the morn ing with labs and clinical skills typically taking place in the afternoons. Lectures and discuss ions are complement ed by labs and clinical skills sessions with embedd ed study time. OMM and other clinical skills are taught longitudinal ly thro ughout the fi rst two years in a progression designed to integra te with and provide a s eamless transition to the third and fourth years. Content is presented by biomedical faculty and physicians incorporating team- teaching and small group learning. For years three and fou r, clinical rotations are typically four (4) weeks in duration at the Regional Clinical sites. Learning assessment during the first 8 Blocks of years one and two includ es integrated exams, quizzes , OS CE Standardized Patient encounters , clinical skills, simulation, anatomy, and OMM practical exa ms. Clinical case exercises help students integrate and apply knowledge acquired during the Block and provide faculty opportunities for monitoring students' learning progress. For years three and four, student assessment occurs via COMAT exams at the end of core rotations and competency -based evaluation s performed by clinical preceptors at the end of each clinical rotation. Students also evaluate each clinical rotation to identify curricular improv ement opportunities . The minimum length of the osteopathic medical curriculum at CUSOM is 167 weeks over four academic years. The curriculum duratio n for each year is: Year 1 = 37 weeks Year 2 = 38 weeks Year 3 = 44 weeks Year 4 = 44 weeks 5.1.2 Programmatic Level Educational Outcome Objectives CUSOM has adopted the 2012 American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM) Osteopathic Core Competencies for Medical Students as the programmatic level educational outcome objectives for graduates since these als o align with the Mission of the University and medical school. 71 These Osteopathic Core Competencies measure specific objectives along the following 14 competency domains: 1. Osteop athic Principles and Practices 2. Medical Knowledge 3. Patient Care 4. Interpe rsonal and Communication Skills 5. Professionalism 6. Practice -Based Learning and Improvement 7. Systems -Based Practice 8. Counseling for Health Promotion/Disease Prevention 9. Cultural Competencies 10. Evaluation of Health Sciences Literature 11. Environmental and Occupational Medicin e (OEM) 12. Public Health Systems 13. Global Health 14. Interprofessional Collaboration The four -year Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine curriculum, which embodies the mind, body, spirit philosophy of the osteopathic profession and Mission of Campbell University, is a systems -based curriculum. The four -year course of study begins with integrated biomedical and clinical didactic and laboratory activities leading up to the third - and fourth -year clinical rotations, which provide the necessary clinical training for transi tion to , and success in , subsequent residency training programs. For the full description and detailed listing of objectives, please refer to the official 2012 AACOM Osteopathic Core Competencies for Medical Students . Document. 5.1.3 Clinical Shadowing Policies and Procedures CUSOM Medical Student Shadowing It is essential that students choosing to engage in shadowing experiences understand the differences between these optional shadowing experiences and the required clinical rotations of the credit -bearing CUSOM curriculum. Clinical rotation s that occur in conjunction with the CUSOM clinical curriculum (Early Clinical Experiences, Outreach, International Medical Missions and MS -3 and MS -4 scheduled rotations) are completed under the supervision of CUSOM -appointed clinical faculty and follow v ery specific guidelines in regards to student's roles, responsibilities, supervision requirements, and feedback and evaluation processes. In contrast to clinical curriculum experiences, shadowing experiences do not occur as part of the student's required CUSOM curriculum and may lack the defined structure, supervision, feedback mechanisms and medical -legal protections provided by forma l clinical rotations . 72 Students choosing to engage in a shadowi ng experience acknowledge they will do so while adhering to the following principles: 1. Shadowing experiences are meant to be observational only and if any hands -on activity occurs with patients, it should be limited to patient examination, approved by the patient and supervising physician, and MUST be repeated by the physician. To protect patients and students, students must not perform any invasive procedures while on shadowing experiences , includi ng but not limited to suturing, endotracheal intubation, performing arterial blood gas testing, or placing IV's, Foley catheters, or central lines or perform exams of the pelvic, breast, rectal and genitourinary systems. In addition, s tudents must not perform any osteopathic manipulation while on shadowing experiences. 2. Students are not protected by malp ractice insurance provided by Campbe ll Un iversity while engaged in physician sh adowing experiences unless the experience is with a CUSOM-appointed faculty memb er and as a part of the curriculum . Students are required to let non -CUSOM ap pointed physicians they are shadowing know that th ey are not covered by malp ractice insurance provid ed by Campbell University. 3. Students must follow all hospital system, facility, and ambulatory policies when engaging in any type of shadowing experience. Individual physicians chosen to shadow with may not be familiar with their facility or healthcare system pol icies so it is the student's respons ibility to make sure they review and comply with a ny applicable policies. 4. Individual physicians may not know the student's level of training, therefore, it is the student's ethical and professional duty to ful ly explain their lev el of tr aining. Shadowing with CUSOM-Appointed Clinical Faculty Members 1. Students who desire to shadow CUS OM-appointed clinical faculty must arrange the experience on their own. 2. Students shadowing with CUSOM clinical faculty memb ers should wear their CUSOM n ame badge and white coat unless dir ected otherwise by their preceptors. 3. Students wishing to schedule a shadowing experience with a CUSOM clinical faculty memb er must submit the Shadowing Agreement Form , (available from the Office of Clinical Affairs) c ompleted in its entirety to the Office of Clinical Affairs. 4. Shadowing experiences should be arranged in conjunction with the preceptor and Regional Dean/Director of Student Medical Education (DSME ), both of whom must sign the agreeme nt form to indicate their approval. 5. Students must sign the form and initial all required attestations. 73 6. The completed form must be submi tted to the Office of Clinical Affairs for review and approval at least two (2) weeks prior to the start of the requested shadowing experience. Shadowing with non-CUSOM Clinicians 1. Students who desire to shadow clinicians without a CUSOM faculty appointment ( non-CUS OM clinicians), must arrange the experience on their own. 2. Students s hadowing with non -CUSOM clinicians must accept and abide by the following conditions : a. CUSOM will not obta in affiliation agreements with sites or preceptors in order to facilitate shadowing experiences. b. CUSOM will n ot provide the clinician or si te with any student records including, but not limited to, results of drug screens and background checks, immunization records, academic performance information or letters of recommendation. c. Students may not wear their CUSOM white coat or name tag. d. Students or the physician they are shadowi ng are not protected by malpractice insurance through Campbell University . e. Students acknowl edge th at Campbell Univ ersity will not be li able for any medi cal care or expenses if they are injured or b ecome ill during , or as a result of, the clinical shadowing experience. They also release Campbell Univ ersity f rom any li ability from any injury or illness which occurs during , or as a result of the sh adowing experience. 3. Even if engaging in shadowing experiences with non-CUSOM clinicians or clinical sites, students must abide by all general guidelines noted previous ly in this document. Violation of any conditions of this Sh adowing Policy is handled as a professionalism issue and may be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion a nd Standards (APPS) Committee. 5.2 Years 1 and 2 Curriculum The first two years of the CUSOM curriculum focus on the integration of fundamental biomedical and clinical science, elements of clinical practice, and professionalism . Historically, the first two years of medical school instruction have been viewed as \"pre- clinical\" with the remaini ng two years being viewed as \"clinical\". At CUS OM, the curriculum is integrated to provide a core of strong bio medical principles in addition to a robust foundation in clinical sciences and osteop athic prin ciples, prin ciples of clinical practice, and professionalism. 74 5.2.1 Curricular Content Overview All semest ers of the first and second year are partitioned into two 9-11 week Blocks. Within the first two Blocks, students are introduced to the biomedical found ational concepts of A natomy, Biochemistry/Cell Biology, Microbiology/ Immunolog y, Pathology, Pharmacology, and Physiology. Anatomy is taught throughout the first year, in Blocks 1 -4, as a component of an integrated systems approach. In Blocks 3 throu gh 8, the CUSOM curriculum follows an organ-system approach to medi cal education. Facu lty incorporate instructional materials which go beyond the basic bio medical principles mastered during the first semest er. Biomedical faculty, prim ary care physicians, and sub-specialty physicians collaborate to deliver integrated content relating to the particular organ system. The Clinical Skills and Ost eopathic Manipulative Medicine courses address content that will facilitate CUSOM student learning, integrat ion, and application of the basic philosop hy, principles, and practice of osteo pathic medi cine. of osteop athic whol e-person healthcare and serve as critical components of the CUSOM curriculum . Lectures and labs incorporate stat e-of-the-art instruction, while Simulation and Standardized Patient experiences allow stud ents to enhance their clinical skills, such as physical exam techniques, interviewing, couns eling, and medical reporting skills necessary to prog ress to the third and fourth years. The Foundations of Medical Practice (FMP) courses, presented through all semest ers of the first- and second-year curriculum, provide CUSOM students a broad ov erview of biostatistics, epidemiology, population health, re search methodo logy, and experimental design for practicing evidenced -based medicine . Students are exposed to the calculations and strategies required to appropriately locate, interpret, design, and complete a research/schol arly project with clinically relevant knowl edge related to compet ent medi cal practice. The Professional Core Compet encies (PCC) courses, also presented through all semest ers of the first- and second-year curriculum, are designed to teach the core compet encies necessary for caring, compassionat e, effective, and holistic practice of osteopathic medicine throu ghout the physician's career. The use of lecture, discussion, and other unique activities in troduces students to medi cal human ities, cultural competence, biomedical ethics, medi cal law and jurisprud ence, quality improvement and patient safety, global health issues, and professionalism. 75 5.2.2 Schedule of Course Offerings OMM = Osteopathic Manipul ative Medicine FMP = Foundations of Medical Practice PCC = Professional Core Competencies OMM = Osteopathic Manipul ative Medicine FMP = Foundations of Medical Practice PCC = Professional Core Competencies CABS I = C linical Applications of Biomedical Sciences I CABS II = C linical Applications of Biomedical Sciences II FIRST YEAR SEMESTER 1 (FALL) SEMESTER 2 (SPRING) Bloc k 1 Integrated Basic Science & Clinical Courses Bloc k 2 Integrated Basic Science & Clinical Courses Bloc k 3 Musculoskeletal System Bloc k 4 Neuroscience & Human Behavio r (Psychiatry) OMED 500 OMM OMED Clinical Skills Skills OMED 506 FMP OMED 507 PCC OMED 522 Ph armacology 540 Physiology OMED 551 Pathology OMED 560 Anatomy OMED 508 OMM OMED Clinical Psychiatry OMED 594 Anatomy SECOND YEAR SEMESTER 3 (FALL) SEMESTER 4 (SPRING) Bloc k 5 Cardiovascular & Respiratory Systems Bloc k 6 Hematology , Dermatology & Renal System s Bloc k 7 Endocrine & Gastrointestinal Systems Bloc k 8 Reproductive System & Clinical Applications of Biomedical Sciences II OMED 600 OMM OMED 601 Clinical Skills OMED 602 603 610 Cardiovascular OMED 620 Respiratory System OMED 604 OMED 605 OMED 609 614 Gastrointes 618 FMP 619 P CC OMED 690 CABS II OMED 695 Reproductive System 76 5.2.3 Course Description s The curriculum in Blocks 1 and 2 of the first year introduces students to the foundational biomedical concepts of Cell and Molecular Biology , Genetics, also consists of introductory clinical training in osteop athic principles and practice in addition to fundamental clinica l skills.

A standardized, competency -based syllabus format is utilized to deliver Osteopathic Principles and Pra ctice ( OPP) and Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine ( OMM ) throughout the first and second years of the cur riculum in the following manner. 5.2.4 .1 Year One Each student receives a minimum of 3 hours per week of didactic and hands-on OMM ins truction under the sup ervision of an American Osteopathic Board of N euromus culosk eletal Medicine Board certified physician(s) and with the assistance of DO faculty table facilitators (approximate faculty to student ratio 1:1 0). 95 The first-year courses provide instruction related to the history of osteop athic medi cine, research in osteop athic medi cine, landm arks, and the introduction anatomical and physiological principles of osteo pathic medi cine. Students also learn the neuromus culosk eletal basis of disease and how it integrates with basic sciences such as anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, etc. In addition, students learn and practic e various osteop athic manipulative treatments, such as soft tissue techniques , muscle energy, counterstrain, high-velocity, low amplitude (HVL A) and myofascial release techniques to treat somatic dysfunction and integrate into the management of certain disease states. 5.2.4 .2 Year Two Each student receive s a minimum of 3 hours per week of didactic and hands -on OMM instruction under the supervision of an American Osteopathic Board of Neuromusculoskeletal Medicine Board Certified physician (s) and with the assistance of DO faculty table facilitators (approximate faculty to student ratio 1:10). During the second year, the OMM curr iculum is organized by body system. Students are instructed on the integration of OPP and OMM in the treatment of somatic dysfunction commonly observed in the management of medical conditions in each system. S tudents gain a deeper understanding of incorporating viscerosomatic reflexes and Chapman points to help guide the development of a differential diagnosis and the therapeutic goals of incorporating OPP into the overall medical management of these conditions . Students also become more adept at incorporating osteopathic principles and manipulative medicine in the management of special patient populations including hospitalized patients, pediatrics , and pregnancy. The OMM lab provides students with a regular review of common techniques used to man age conditions such as short lower extremity, tension and dysfunctions. 5.2.4 .3 Years Three and Four A description of the integration of OPP and OMM throughout the third - and fourth -years of the curriculum is presented in Section 5.3.13 of this Bulletin . 96 5.3 Years 3 and 4 Curriculum 5.3.1 Philosophy of Clinical Training CUSOM students in years three and four are assigned to Regional Sites/Clinical Campuses. Site assignment takes place during the second year. Clinical rotations occur within hospital sites for inpatient experiences, in ambulatory practices, and in geriatric acute care and long -term facilities. The clinical training program for all s tudents, regardless of their clinical training site, also includes the following: All students will spend time in rural, small, urban , or critical access hospitals for a rural/underserved care clinical experience. During their third year, all students wil l complete at least one clinical rotation under the supervision of an osteopathic physician and at least two rotations which include an inpatient experience. Prior to their fourth -year clinical rotations, all students will work with a resident physician(s) currently enrolled in an accredited program of graduate medical education . Clinical rotations are designed to provide the student with an education in the general areas of medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, psychiatry, family medicine, geriatrics, and emergency medicine. The philosophical framework of clinical education and training at CUSOM is to prepare students to become competent and caring osteopathic physicians who clearly recognize their roles as professionals and providers of comprehensive healthcare to the individual , the family as a unit , and to the communities they serve. Osteopathic physicians must be able to function in the role of the leader of a healthcare team to bring about needed change from the level of the individu al to the level of the community. The ultimate intent of the program is to prepare patient -centered physicians who will positively impact the equality of healthcare and healthcare delivery systems and will improve healthcare access for individuals and the ir families. CUSOM believes the physician must assume a leadership role not only in the medical community but also in the broader community in which they serve . Community leadership is an integral part of improving the healthcare of the community as -a-whole; thus, physicians must be committed to th e prevention of illness and improving the delivery of healthcare services at extended levels. 97 The CUSOM clinical curriculum is a challenging blend of tradition al and innovative components d esigned to: Foster the analytic and problem-solving skills requisite for physicians involved in disease pr evention, diagnosis, and treatment of individual patients, families, communities, and populations at-large; Ensu re the acquisition and application of basic clinical knowl edge, osteopathic principles and practice , and essential clinical skills; Develop an un derstanding of contempo rary healthcare delivery issues; Cultivate effective physician-patient relationships based upon integrity, respect, compassio n, and cultural sensitivity ; Develop h igh ethical standards; and Promote a lifelong commitment to learning. Following clinical training, students , regardless of their chosen specialty, will have a clear understanding of, and appreciation for the important roles of the prim ary care physician which include, but are not limited to, the ability to: Demonstr ate clinical excellence, using current eviden ce-based medi cine and bio medical knowl edge, to identi fy and manage their patients' medical conditions ; Provide continuing and compr ehensive care to individuals and families; Integrate the behavioral, emotional, so cial, cultural, and envi ronment al factors of individuals and families in promoting health and man aging disease; Develop and maintain t he knowl edge, skills, and attitudes required for the delivery of quality care and outcom es in modern medical practice in a rapidly changing world; Pursue a regular and systematic p rogram of lif elong learning; Recognize ind ications for and initiate consu ltation with other medical specialists while maintaining continuity of care; Collaborate with an interprofessional team and s hare tasks and respons ibilities with other healthcare professionals; Be aware of the findi ngs of relevant research; understand and critically evaluate this body of research, and appropriately apply the results of research to med ical practice; Manage their practice in a business -like, cost -efficient manner which will provide professional satisfaction and time for a rewarding personal life; Serve as an advocate for patients within the healthcare system; Assess the quality of care they provide and actively pursue measures to continually improve ; Apply current medi cal knowl edge to identi fy, evaluate, and minimize risks for p atients and families; Recognize community resour ces as an integral part of the healthcare system and participate in improving the health of the community; 98 Inform and couns el pati ents con cerning their health problems and recognize and value differences in patient and physician backgrounds, beliefs, goals, and expectation s; Develop p hysician-patient and problem-solving; Balance potential benefits, costs, and resources in determining appropriate in terventions; and Integrate and effectively utilize osteop athic principles and practices in the d elivery of optimal p atient care. The gene ral expectations for all clinical rotations are designed to help students develop the fundament al skills of medi cal probl em solving, case management, procedural expertise, and professional demeanor. Clinical rotations are under the direct supervision of the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs, led by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. CUSOM has established affiliations with a wide range of hospitals, clinics, and physicians offering diverse training opportunities. The clinical program has been organized to permit the g reatest degree of educational exposure in a practical, clinical environment and to develop expertise in the areas of patient diagnosis and management. The clinical rot ations provid ed at each affiliated clinical campus and the number of CUS OM students assigned to each affiliat ed clinical campus are determined by mutual agree ment with CUSOM, the Asso ciate Dean for Cl inical Affairs, the Hospit al Admin istrator(s), Regional Dean, Vi ce-President for Medical Education (VPME) / Director of Medical Education (DME), Clinical Faculty, and the Office of Clinical Affairs. Whe never possible, CUSOM utilizes hospit als with accredited postdoctoral residency training programs approved by the A ccreditation Coun cil for Graduate M edical Education (ACGME) for postdo ctoral training to provide assurance of adequate teaching material and faculty. 5.3.2 Third -Year Clinical Rotations CUSOM's third -year osteopathic medical students are required to complete eleven rotations. Each rotation consists of approximately 160 contact hours inclusive of modules, self -directed learning, didactics, and other duties as assigned by the site . All third -year clinical rotations must be completed at the student's respective clinical campus with CUSOM -appointed faculty. All third -year rotation s must be successfully completed prior to progressing to the fourth year and must be completed at the student's assigned clinical campus. Third-year CORE rotations include Family Medicine, Medicine I and II, Obstetrics & Gynecology, Pediatrics, Psychiatry , and Surgery . 99 Required Rotations for third year are listed below: Simulation Medicine (SIM) (4 weeks) Family Medicine (FM) (4 weeks) CORE Medicine (MED) I (4 weeks) CORE Medicine (MED) I I (4 weeks) CORE Obstetrics/Gynecology (OBG) (4 weeks) CORE Pediatrics (PED ) (4 weeks) CORE Psychiatry/Behavioral Medicine (PSY) (4 weeks) CORE Surgery (SUR) (4 weeks) CORE Rural/Underserved/International (R/U/I) (4 weeks) Medical Selective (MS) (4 weeks) Medical/Surgical Selective (M/SS) (4 weeks) During their third -year rotations, all students, regardless of their clinical training site, will work with a resident physician (s) currently enrolled in an accredited program of graduate medical education , complete at least one clinical rotation under the supervision of an osteopathic physician , and complete at least two rotations which an inpatient experience . 5.3.3 Fourth-Year Clinical Rotations CUSOM's fourth -year osteopathic medical students are required to successfully complete all fourth -year rotations to be eligible for graduation. Additionally, to become eligible for graduation, each fourth -year student must have passed COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE and COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE* and successfully completed all clinical rotation requirements. * NOTE: COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE was suspended indefinitely in February 2021, and formally discontinued in June 2022. COMLEX -USA candidates are currently verified by attestation from their COM dean that they are proficient in these important clinical skills. Additi onal information is available on the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners COMLEX - USA Level 2 -PE website . As such, to be eligible to graduate, each student must have successfully completed CUSOM's Clinical Skills Assessment Program, which includes both a longitudinal assessment of student performance and an on -campus multi -station Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE) during the fourth year. This multi -statio n OSCE, also called the Physical Exam -Qualifying Exam (PE -QE), requires students to demonstrate successfully the fundamental clinical skills and physician -related competency domains required for graduation, entrance into supervised graduate medical educati on programs, and the provision of safe osteopathic medical care of patients. 100 Students are also provided the opportunity to participate in twenty (20) weeks of elective rotations which may be completed at non -core sites. These elective rotations may be utilized by students for audition rotations at sites with residency programs or to obtain additional experience in the student's areas of interest. CUSOM's fourth-year osteop athic medi cal students are required to complete the following clinical rotations: Residen cy Development (RD) (4 weeks) Emergency Medicine (EM) (4 weeks) Geriatrics (GER) (4 weeks) Electives (ELEC) * I, II, III, IV, V (20 weeks) Medical Selective (MS) (4 weeks) Primary Care Selective (PCS) (4 weeks) Surgical Selective (SS) (4 weeks) Students are required to comp lete a Sub-Internship (Sub-I) during one of their selective, elective, or Em ergency Medicine rotations . In an effort to provide fourth -year students with increase d flexibility and a greater oppo rtunity to audition or rotate at sites they may be interested in for residency training, CUSOM allows students to do one (1) of the following three (3) required fourth-year rotations at a site with an ACGME -approved residency training program . Medical Selective (MS) * (4 weeks) Primary Care Selective (PCS) * (4 weeks) Surgical Selective (SS)* (4 weeks) * All elective and selective rotations scheduled outside CUSOM regional affiliated sites mu st be approved in advance by the Associ ate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Most rotations are scheduled on a four-week basis; however, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs may approve students to participate in two- week elective and selective rotations. This flexibility provi des students the oppo rtunity to participate in up to six (6) rotations (five (5) electives plus one (1) of the above listed selectives) at sites outside CUSOM's core clinical campuses . In addition, the remaining two (2) fourth -year selectives may be completed at another CUSOM clinical campus as the rotation capacity allows . Students are required to complete their Geriatrics and Emergency Medicine rotations at their respective CUSOM clinical campus . 101 5.3.4 Schedule of Rotation Offerings 5.3.5 Selective and Elective Rotations CUSOM selective rotations are chosen from the CUSOM surgical and medi cal selective lists and are based on educational standards and requirements, the student 's self-assessment of areas where they would benefit most from further education and patient exposur e, along with input from the Asso ciate D ean for Clinical Affairs and respective Clinical Ch airs. Ele ctives may be scheduled outside CUSOM r egional clinical training s ites; how ever, each elective site and rotation requests must be submi tted to the Office of Clinical Affairs at least sixty (60) days in advance of the rotation start date and approved by the Associ ate Dean for Clinical Affairs. CUSOM does not arrange student electives or selectives outside CUSOM's regional clinical training si tes. If a student chooses to do electives or selectives at hospitals with ACGME -accredited post-graduate programs or at a military facility (Health Professions Scholarship Program, HPSP students only), they must arrange those rot ations thems elves with appropriate notification to the respective clinical campus student medical education coordinator.

Based on their medical interests, the student will choose relevant topics from which they will develop two simulation cases: one manikin - or augmented reality -based case and one Standardized -Patient based case. A single, hybrid progressive case can be completed as an option. Within each case, the student must identify specific measurable objectives to cover during a simulation learner's exposure to the case. Specific debriefing approaches and objectives must accompany the work. Surgery/General - 10.0 Credits Through participation in this rotation, students increase their knowl edge base and experience in pr eoperative, intra-operative and postop erative care. Students work under the dir ect supervision of residents and attending physicians to learn and apply op erative techniques, anatomy, physiology, and pathology. Students have an oppo rtunity to expand their manu al skills while assisting in surgery and other procedures and are also expected to participate in patient care, te aching rounds, educational conferences, and le ctures. Surgery/Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery - 10.0 Credits This is a fourth-year surgical rotation , and the student must have successful ly completed a General Surgery rotation. The training in this area will include repair, replacement, and reconstruction of defects in form and function. Emph asis will be pla ced on multiple components of plastic and reconstru ctive su rgery such as skin and soft tissue tumors, hand surgery, and aesthetic surgery. Students are expected to participate in patient care, te aching rounds, educational conferences, and le ctures. Surgery/Vascular - 10.0 Credits After completion of a General Surgery rotation, students may elect to do a Vascular Surgery rotation. In addition to assisting in surgery, students will partake in daily rounds, consults, and time spent in the surgeon's office. This rotation expands on previous ly learned surgical skills, and provide students the oppo rtunity to work with a vascular surgeon. Students are expected to participate in patient care, teaching rounds, educational conferences, and lectures. The most up -to-date list of elective and selective rotations, along with their course descriptions and syllabi are maintained on CUSOM's web -based evaluation system . 122 5.3.13 Curricular Integration of OPP and OMM Years Three and Four CUSOM utilizes a structural approach to osteopathic (OMM) in tegra tion in the clinical years. The assessment of the cognitive learning and practical application of os teopathic manipulation consists of evaluation and assessment of students' psychomo tor learning through practical hands-on and oral evaluations under the sup ervision of clinical faculty. This method of assessment a ssists students in their preparation for both the CO MLEX-USA Level 2-CE, COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE*, and the transition to residency training. To become eligible for graduation, each fourth -year student must have passed COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE and COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE* and successfully completed all clinical rotation requirements. * NOTE: COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE was suspended indefinitely in February 2021, and formally discontinued in June 2022. COMLEX -USA candidates are currently verified by attestation from their COM dean that they are proficient in these important clinical skills. Additi onal Information is available on the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners COMLEX - USA Level 2 -PE website . As such, to be eligible to graduate, each student must have successfully completed CUSOM's Clinical Skills Assessment Program, which includes both a longitudinal assessment of student performance and an on -campus multi -station Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE) during the fourth year. This multi -station OSCE, also called the Physical Exam -Qualifying Exam (PE -QE), requires students to demonstrate successfully the fundamental clinical skills and physician -related competency domains required for gradua tion, entrance into supervised graduate medical education programs, and the provision of safe osteopathic medical care of patients. OMM Hands -on Experiences Participation in hands-on OMM experiences is includ ed during third- and fourth-year clinical rotations, Callback Fridays, and Residency Development month. Osteopathic education plays a key role in the entire curriculum and students will gain an understanding of the osteopathic profession as it relates to all aspects of healthcare. 123 OMM Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Achievement Test (COMAT) Requirement : Osteopathic manipulative medi cine reading assignments are inclu ded in each of the relevant core clinical rotations throu ghout the course of the third year of tr aining. Students are requir ed to complete these reading assignments concurrently with all other assigned modu les for each clinical rotation. The info rmation contai ned in the OMM r eading assignments are assess ed using the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiner's OMM COM AT which students are required to take during R esidency Development month . Students are required to pass the OMM COMAT, defined as achieving a score within two (2) St andard Deviations of the mean. Osteopathic medi cal kn owledge emphasized during clinical rotations includes, but is not limited to : Concepts basic to osteop athic healthcare includin g the self-healing tendency/processes, the unity of the organism in its environme nt, and the ind ications and application of osteop athic diagnostic and therapeutic manipulative pro cesses, including when and how to safely apply them ; The philosop hy and principles of osteo pathic medicine; The history, growth, and development of the profession; The effects of growth, development, and aging on the musculosk eletal system (no rmal and variations of norm within the muscul oskeletal system ; Most frequently encountered structural anomalies and functional abnormalities in the mus culosk eletal system at each age group ; Somatic changes, including somatovisceral and viscerosomatic changes, which occur as a result of distant disease processes and the relationship of th ese changes in delaying the resolution of the dis ease process; Musculosk eletal evaluation assessment te chniques suitable for each age group and situation ; Primary somatic changes resulting f rom anatomical syndromes and their r elationship to o ther syndromes; and The applications of osteop athic philosop hy and principles in special situations with in the life cycle. 124 Students will dev elop a d eeper understanding of the following osteopathic principles: The relationship of the philosop hy and pri nciples of osteop athic medicine to the concepts of health and disease; The relationship of the philosop hy and principles of osteop athic medi cine to care and management; The of the philosop hy and principles of osteop athic medi cine to situations in each of the various sp ecialty-specific conditions; and The impact of the philosophy and principles of osteopathic medi cine on the practice of sub -specialty areas of medicine . During the third- and fourth-year, stud ents a re required to demonstr ate knowledge and/or skills related to the following areas : Application of basic osteopathic concepts to patient care (diagnosis, treatment, variations, and indications ); Use of osteopathic manipulative techniques in diagnosing/treating problems in special situations (e.g., pregnancy, labor, pediatrics, surgery ); Identifying indications/contraindications for osteopathic manipulative techniques , including those in situations unique to the various specialties ; Utilizing a variety of techniques in osteopathic manipulative medici ne applied/adjusted to the unique needs of the individual patient (e.g., in terms of age, development, disorder, body habitus ); A recognition of the relationship of disease/disorder of the musculoskele tal system to total well -being ; and Writing of appropri ate orders and progress notes relevant to the use of osteopathic manipulative treatment. Callb ack Fridays During the third - and fourth -year, students are required to return to CUSOM on the last Friday (Callback Friday) of the following clinical rotations: Family Medicin e, Medicine II, Obst etrics, Pediatrics, Psyc hiatry, Surgery and Emergency Medicine. During these sessions, students take end-of- rotation exams, participate in c linical skills and OSCE experiences, and attend a variety of professional seminars. Students returning from their Pediatric and Psychiatry rotations are also required to participate in Osteopathic Principles and Practice OSCE sessions. Full attendance and participation for the entire day is MANDATORY. Callb ack Friday sessions typically run from 8am-5pm; therefore students sho uld NOT make any travel plans prior to 5pm. 125 On each Callb ack Friday, students take a COMAT or comparable exam (for designated rotations) from 8am -12noon. During the afternoon sessions, which typically run from 1pm -5pm, students participate in clinical skills, OSCEs (including OMM specific OSCEs) and Simulation lab activities relevant to the student's upcoming clinical rotation or other educational session as described above. During fourth -year clinical rotations, students are required to attend and actively participate in a minimum of two (2) on-campus Callback Friday Simulation /OSCE workshops , one during the Residen cy Development month and the other during their required Emergenc y Medicine rotation. During Residency Development month, students are required to perform an OMM-specific OSCE in a simulated outpatient setting. Students returning to campus to take their required Emergency Medicine end-of-rotation exam are required to attend an OMM wo rkshop structured to help them develop strategies for integrating OMM into their post-graduate education. 5.4 Clinical Rotation Standards 5.4.1 General S tandards The following general objectives are expectations for all clinical rotations and are designed to help students develop the fundamental skills of medical problem solving, case management, procedural expertise, and professional demeanor. Students should review these objectives carefully as their evaluation on each rotation will in large measure be b ased on achievement of these objectives. As a result of each clinical rotation, students should become better able to obtain an adequate, logical, and sequential medical history. Students should include in the history of present illness (HPI) those perti nent positive and negative features which demonstrate their understanding of the patient's medical condition(s) . All medications , treatments, and important previous milestones concerning that illness should be clearly noted. Past History will contain but not be limited to the following : Compl ete past and present medi cation use, including doses and duration of use ; All p revious su rgeries, including approximate dates and sequelae; All p revious injuri es and any sequelae; Immuni zations ; Quantitative estimate of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug use, and other appropriate social histo ry; and All untow ard drug reactions (allergic or toxic), including anesthetic agents and t h e specific reaction. If none, it sh ould be clearly noted. 126 Family History will include all diseases with a familial tendency, or which may have a bearing on the HPI. The ages and health st atus of all first-degree relatives should also be listed . Review of Systems will contain some notation for each body system. Detailed and complete system histori es are mandatory for symptoms un covered during the review of systems. Physical Examination - Performance and documentation of an appropriate physical examina tion is required and includes: Accurate and compl ete vital signs; A thoughtful description of the patient's general appearance and behavior; A thorough and complete description of physical findings pertinent to the HPI; and Careful attention to find ings suggested by the past medi cal histo ry or review of systems. The remainder of the physical examination must be sufficiently detailed in order to identify incidental abnormal findings not related to the present illness or positive historical clues. Documentation - Students must document a complete History & Physical (H&P ) in the patient's chart. It should include a brief summary statement, which demonstrates the student has synthesized the historical and physical exam data. Oral Presentation - Orally present the patient's data to the resident and/or attending physician in 5-10 minutes in standard , logical, sequential fashion, demonstrating an understanding of the patient's disease process and its manifestations in the patient. Differential Diagnosis - Apply basic medical knowledge in synthesizing a differential diagnosis and plan of management for the patient's medical condition(s) . Success in this area requires the ability to: Generate a clear probl em list; Develop a plan of action to confirm a diagnosis ; Review the pertinent literature to expand student knowl edge of the problem; Identify indicated laboratory tests; Suggest a therapeutic plan of treatment; Define patient education ob jectives and assess the patient's understanding; Perform as an effective memb er of the healthcare team and the patients' primary physician; Gather patient information and data and offer an interpretation of the data relevant to the p atient's concern(s) and condition(s) ; 127 Report data on rounds and in progress notes. P rogress notes and related documentation should reflect a dispassion ate report; and Acquire sufficient knowledge and skill concerning the patient's medical condition(s) . Affective and Professional Behavior - Demonst rate and develop the following affective (attitud es, feelings) and behavioral characteristics: Work with p atients in a respectful, compassion ate, caring, and empath etic mann er; Develop a profession al attitude and demeanor in working with patients, peers, faculty, house staff, healthcare profession als, and oth er persons in the healthcare setting; and Identify and emulate appropriate role models among attending physicians and house staff, includi ng those who demonstr ate the process of developing rapport and positive communi cations with patients, f aculty, house staff, and ot her healthcare profession als. Demonst rate the followi ng profession al behaviors: Reliability and dependability Self-awareness Emotional st ability Integrity and hon esty Initiative and enthusiasm Punctuality Self-directed learning 5.4.2 Ethical Standards Essential hum anistic qualities required of physicians include integrity, respect, and compassion . INTEG RITY is the personal commi tment to be and trustwo rthy; this includ es evaluation and demonst ration of one's own skills and abilitie s. RESPECT is the personal commitment to honor other's choices and rights regarding thems elves and their medical care. COMPA SSION is an appreciation that suffering and illness engender special needs for comfort and help without evoking excessive emotional involvement. In broad terms, these words propose the qualities of mind and feeling a physician shou ld bring to the profession of medi cine. They enforce no orthod oxy. They do not establish a hierarchy of values or issue imperatives. They do not force the varied facets of each physician's personality into a rigid mold. 128 These words describe a good relationship between patient and physician, a relationship in whi ch the dignity and freedom of both parties are respected, and their expectations and needs are acknowl edged. This description can be interpreted in many ways; its application to different styles of personality and to diff erent situ ations is variable. 5.4.3 Non-Cognitive Standa rds As future physici ans, m edical students h ave a responsibility to guide their actions to s erve the b est int erest of their fellow students, p atients, and faculty. This responsibility is uph eld by maintaining the high est degree of p ersonal and profession al integrity. To meet these obj ectives, the following st andards a re expected of all m edical stud ents at CUSOM. Medical students sh all demonstrate d edication to acquiring the knowl edge, skills , and attitudes n ecessary to provide competent medi cal care. They sh all: Assume personal responsibili ty for their medical education; Continue to study, apply, and advance scientific knowledge, and make relevant information available to patients, colleagues, and the publi c; Seek appropriate consu ltation with faculty, staff, and colleagues in their interactions with p atients; and Take an active role in the plannin g, implem entation , and evaluation of the medical education pr ocess by discussion with inst ructors and peers as well as throu gh written evaluation. Medical stud ents sh all demonstrate profession al behavior expected of a physi cian and must : Be truthful in carrying out educational and clinical responsibilities; never falsify information , including patient histories, physical examinations, or laboratory data, or purposely mis represent a situation; never tamper with, remove, or destroy patient records or educational materials, in cluding slides or anatomical diss ections; Maintain confidentiality of information concerning patients and refrain from discussing cases except und er appropriate circumst ances; Be punctual, reliable, and conscientious in fulfilling profession al duties, including attendance at lectures, examinations, and clinical rotations ; Not p articipate in patient care when under the influ ence of any substance or ot her conditions, whi ch could impair jud gment or ability to function; Maintain profession al hygi ene, demeanor, and appearance when in a patient care setting or representing CUSOM ; Accept the responsibility to review plans or dir ectives for p atient care with the attending physici an when, after careful consid eration, the student b elieves these plans or di rectives are not in the b est int erests of the patient; 129 Clearly identify their role as medi cal stud ents in the patient care setting; Seek appropriate faculty supervision ; and Respect civil and criminal laws, hospital rules, and univ ersity rules governing the condu ct of m edical students . Medical students sh all show compassion and respect for thems elves, th eir families, their colleagues, faculty, st aff, and, most importantly, the patients who participate in th eir education. They sh all: Within the confines of p rofession al confidenti ality, establish rapport and deal hon estly with pati ents, colleagues, faculty, st aff, and the patient's family; Respect patients, their families, and their p rofession al colleagues, including st aff and other h ealthcare providers, reg ardless of th eir ag e, sex, race, national origin, religion, socioeconomic status, state of h ealth, personal h abits, sexu al orientation, cleanlin ess or attitud e; and Care for thems elves by following good h ealth m aintenance pra ctices related to physi cal and me ntal health and seek help in this r egard when help is n eeded. 5.5 Clinical Rotation Scheduling 5.5.1 Assig ned Rotations Students are provided a schedule of their assigned rotations. No changes are allowed, except for extenuating medical, financial, or personal hardships, which will be reviewed and are at the discretion and approval of the Associate Dean for Clinical Affa irs. Assigned rotations not completed will be record ed as a failure (FC) and will be referred to the Academic P erformance, Promotion and Sta ndards (APPS) Committee for review and adjudication following the process described elsewhere in this Bulletin . If a student is allowed to continue in the program, they may be placed on a Modified Course of Study in order to make up the rotation at a later time as designated by the APPS Committee and the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Placement on a Modified Course of Study may result in a delay in the student's graduation date and may adversely affect financial aid and the student's ability to participate in the residency match process. 5.5.2 Notice of Site Changes Clinical training sites are subject to change. While the training sites are subject to change without notice to students, those students who are in clinical rotations at the time of the change will be accommodated for the duration of the rotation when possible. Rotation sites will be updated annually. 130 5.5.3 Selective Rotations If a student decides to exercise the option of completing one (1) of the fourth - year Selectives away from their assigned clinical campus , they must arrange for the Selective rotation as they would for an elective and according to the process presented in Section 5.3.5 of this Bulletin . 5.5.4 Rural/Underserved/International (R/U/I) The third -year Rural/Underserved/International (R/U/I) rotation may take place either at a rural site or a non -rural und erserved site. Rural and und erserved are as are usu ally, but not always, d esignated or qu alify as a HPSA (He alth Profession al Short age Ar ea) or M UA (Medically Underserved Ar ea) thr ough federal or st ate stand ards. Third -year R/U/I rotations should be performed at outpatient clinics, must be in a primary care me dical field su ch as Family Medicin e, Inte rnal M edicin e, or P ediatrics, and must be compl eted at an appropriate facility or clinic b earing a fully executed affiliation agreement at the Regional Site. 5.5.5 Electives Students must honor their elective rotation commitments out o f respect for the clinical site. If a student must cancel an elective, they must first notify the Office of Clinical Affairs no later than four (4) weeks prior to the start of that rotation. Cancellations will not be accepted after that time. This policy is necessary because many hospitals reserve a limited number of elective slots for students and once full, may turn away students from other schoo ls. Withdrawal on short notice means a desirable rotation slot , which could have been offered to another interested and qualified student, is wasted. This is disrespectful and unfair to the hospital and , more importantly, it is unfair to fellow students. Any changes to elective rotations received after the deadline must be accompanied by official documentation certifying the student has been cancelled by the physician/hospital originally registered. A letter from the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs verifying the student is in good standing and current on their required immunizations , along with proof of coverage by CUSOM's malpractice insurance will be sent to the designated host institution for each outside elective rotation. Students must arrange their own electives with the clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator according to the process presented in Section 5.3.5 of this Bulletin . Questions regarding the scheduling of third - or fourth -year elective rotations should be directed to t he respective clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator or the appropriate CUSOM Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator. Although it is preferred students schedule their elective rotation for four consecutive weeks, some rotations may be split into two 2 -week elective rotations. The specific rotations eligible for two -week rotations and limitations of this option are reviewed in Section 5.3 of this Bulletin . 131 5.5.6 Elective and Other Rotations Information regarding the scheduling of Elective and Selective rotations may be found in Section 5.3. 5 of this Bulletin . Rotation approval forms for requested Elective, Selective , or other rotations must be submitted to the Office of Clinical Affairs a minimum of sixty ( 60) days before the beginning of the requested rotation. Many clinical sites requir e a list of do cuments in o rder to p articipate in a rotation at their sit es. This may include but is not limit ed to: Letter of Good Standing ( states your academic st anding, BLS & ACLS certification, etc.); Immuniz ation R ecords proof PPD, flu v accination, etc.); Crimin al Background Check; Drug S Proof of ability/Malpra ctice Cov erage. For liability reasons, the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs will not release the proof of liability/malpractice coverage to the student, but can release this information to a requesting entity only for the purposes of clinical coordination. In order to facilitate the provision of these documents to the clinical site, students must provide the following information to the Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator : Name, title, fax numb er, and em ail address of the contact person; Name of healthcare or medical edu cation institution requesting documentation; and A list of the specific document ation the entity is requesting. ** No travel plans regarding away rotations should be made by the student until they have received official approval from the Office of Clinical Affairs and notice of a fully executed affiliation agreement. ** 5.5.7 Family Medicine Preceptor Rotations Rotations must be scheduled for four (4) consecutive weeks with an office -based or residency -based family physician. The precepting physician must be board certified in Family Medicine. 5.5.8 Out-of-State Rotations All out -of-state rotations are subject to the State Autho rization and Reciprocity Act. This federal legislation requires states to abide by state-assigned law which may require students doing either online education or distance learning to obtain the formal permission of the state to serve as a clinical practicum or medical clerkship within their state. Each state has a different requirement for state authorization or approval. The federal penalty for violating the State 132 Authorization and Reciprocity Act is loss of federal education funding for the institution. This legislation affects all educational institutions, including CUSOM. Stud ents desiring to participate in a clinical rotation outside of the state of North Carolina must work with the Office of Clinical Affairs to ensure all conditions of the State Autho rization and Reciprocity Act are met. This is in addition to the completion of the Away Rotation R equest form and submission of all required documentatio n. The process for requesting out-of-state clinical rotations is as follows: Compl ete the Affiliation Agree ment Request form, available from the Office of Clini cal Affairs on CUSOM's web -based evaluation system , between six (6) months and no less than sixty (60) days prior to the start of the rotation. Clini cal Affairs will review the compl eted form and work with the Provost 's Office staff to establish n ecessary state approvals to complete the rotation. Clini cal Affairs will not ify the student of the status of the request at least thirty (30) d ays prior to the start of the rotation . Any further questions or concerns regarding the State Autho rization and Reciprocity Act should be sent to the Office of Clinical Affairs. 5.5.9 International Rotations Specific information regarding the scheduling of international rotations may be found in Section 5.3.10 of this Bulletin . A limited number of international rotations are available for fourth -year Elective Rotations. International rotations must be at CUSOM -affiliated sites and approved in advance by the Department of Community and Global Health, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, the Dean, and the Campbell University Study Abroad Commit tee. A signed affiliation agreement between CUSOM and the internationa l organization must be in place at least ninety ( 90) days prior to the clinical rotation. CU SOM does not assume any liability for health or safety while on international rotations. All international experiences must comply with CUSOM poli cies for international rotations. Requirements for students wishing to do an international rotation includ e: Must be in good academic standing ; Must h ave taken and passed COMLEX-USA Level 1; Must have approval of the rotation from the Department of Communi ty and Glob al Health, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, the Dean, and the Campb ell Univ ersity Study Abro ad Committee ; Must h ave necessary immuni zations, p assport, and other requirements for travel; Students are responsible for obtaining travel insurance, including evacuation coverage, and proof of such must be presented with the required forms for international travel; 133 Students must have completed the Travel Safety SDL and electroni cally sign to acknowledge understanding of safe practice in foreign country prior to travel; and At the completion of the rotation, the student m ust prepare a written case report from their clinical experience abroad (no more than two pages, topic pertinent to the country of rotation, e.g., tropi cal diseases, occupational inju ries, foodb orne illnesses, etc.). 5.5.10 Addition al Clinical Rotation Information for Military Rotations All students in the United States Armed Forces may complete certain rotations in the Armed Forces and Ve terans Affairs facilities with approval by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. A copy of the military orders must be presented to the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs for approval. 5.5.11 Away Rotation Requests All students desiring to compl ete elective rotations away from their assigned CUSOM clinical campus must complete an affiliation agree ment request form. A link to this form may be found on CUSOM 's web -based evaluation system. All affiliation agree ment requests must be subm itted in a timely manner (at least sixty ( 60) days prior to the start of a domestic r otation and at least 90 for all international rotations) . Timely Approval It is extremely impor tant students complete their affiliation agreement requests on time. Failure to submit the appropriate forms within the timeframe allotted may result in a rotation other than the requested elective being assigned to the student by their respective clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator and Regional Dean /DMSE . No rotation may be started without being approved (see Unauthori zed Rotations). 5.5.12 Scheduling Away Rotations Many fourth -year elective rotations are scheduled through VSLO (Visiting Student Learning Opportunities) and Clinician Nexus. Information regarding using VSLO and Clinician Nexus to schedule rotations may be obtained from the Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator . Additional information regarding VSLO is also available on CUSOM's web -based evalu ation system. 134 Unauthoriz ed Rota tions Any student starting an Elective or Selective rotation without a fully executed affiliation agreement with the Office of Clinic al Affairs will not receive credit for that rotation and all violations will be subject to review by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee . For questions regarding the process, students should contact their clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordi nator or the Third -Year or Fourth - Year Student Medi cal Edu cation Clinical Coordin ator. 5.6 General Policies and Procedures - Clinical Rotations 5.6.1 Overview Medical students will work directly under the supervision of an attending physician. A licensed physician must countersign all entries in the patient record. Students must clearly identify themselves in the medical record as either a n MS-3 or a n MS-4 student. Histo ry & Physicals: Students ar e responsible for all assigned H&Ps, including osteopathic stru ctural exams. P receptors will review student performance and provide constructive feedback to assist in improvement . Procedures: Students may, only with direct supervision, perform a procedure in the presence of a licensed, CUSOM -appointed physician. Unde r NO circumst ances are students to attempt a procedure without direct supervision. Rounds : The student's direct supervisor will provide the schedule to make rounds on each service. Students are required to be prompt and prepared to discuss the status of patients and any results/reports which may have been received. Clinical rounds are an impor tant component of medical education and s tudents should not be afraid to ask questions or speak up if there is something needing clarification. Morning Report: Many services will have a morning report, where the \"on- call\" house staff will report on the events of each patient during the night. This is also where the chief resident will make assignments for the day. There is usually an educational component during this time. This conference is MANDAT ORY if the student is on a service with morning report and students must BE ON TIME and be prepared. Procedure Workshop, Simulation or Skills Lab : Occa sional ly during the rotation or at the clinical training site, workshops or \"skills labs\" will be provided to enhance procedural or OMT training. Atte ndance is MANDATORY. If assigned, students are expected to attend and be prepared. 135 Didactics: Each service and clinical site has its own didactic schedule, which will be prov ided the first day on service. Atte ndance at all didactic sessions is MAND ATORY. In the event a student is outside a 30-minute travel radius from the site, teleconferenc e options are available for lectures scheduled for one hour, such as noon conferences and morning report. Students must be in -person for half -day didactic programming at their respective clinical campus. If students ar e performi ng duties related to the rotation, such as participating in a surgica l case or delivery, the student MUST communi cate the explanation for the absence with the clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator . In addition, students should attempt to attend any other hospital conferences or educational programs of interest (with appropriate supervisor permission). A schedule of the hospital educational programs should be obtained each wee k or month from the hospital Department of Medical Education. Evaluations : During the final week of the rotation, students should remind the preceptor to complete their student evaluation (Preceptor Evaluation of Student (PES)) in the web -based evaluation system and schedule a time to review their performance and preceptor evaluation. All evaluations are to be completed online and must be completed in a timely fashion as noted in Section s 6.2.7.1 -6.2.7.3 of this Bulletin . Prior to completion of the rotation, students are expected to complete evaluations of the rotation (Student Evaluation of Site (SES)) and of the preceptor (Student Evaluation of Preceptor (SEP)) . Completion of these evaluation s are required as this inform ation is utilized in an anonymous fashion to provide valuable clinical rotation, site, and preceptor feedback and assist CUSOM in its effort to continually improve its clinical rotation program. Failure to comp lete any rotation requirement or submit any required rotation do cument ation will r esult in a failing grade (Fail Clinical, FC) and referral to the AP PS Committee. Any specific preceptor or rotation concern should not wait for documentation in the end -of-rotation evaluation but should be brought to the immediate attention of the Regional Dean /DSME or Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Electronic Health Record (EHR) : At most training sites, students will receive a Username and Password for accessing the EHR in use on that rotation. With this, students will be able to access protected personal health information. Students must complete site -specific EHR training and s ign a \"confidentiality agreement\" to receive this access. Students MUST NOT use others' Usernames and Passwords as doing so constitutes a HIPAA violation and may carry civil and legal penalties. 136 Confi dentiality: All rotating students are subject to the policies and procedures of co nfidentiality for patient information at their respective clinical campuses and facilities at which they are completing a clinical rotation. Confidentiality policies also apply to non-electronic patient information - all must be protected and shared only with those who have a profession al need-to-know . 5.6.2 Responsibilities and Duties The student, while on a rotation service, will at all times be responsible to the personnel in charge of the service involved. In addition, all students are expected to comply with the policies and procedures established by the hospital or clinic at which they are being trained. All problems or concerns should be communicated immediately to the Regional Dean/DSME and the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs. Any time spent away from the hospital/clinic during regular duty hours for lectures, conferences, and other programs conducted at local hospital/clinic or university must be approved as noted elsewhere in this Bulletin . Although patient care assignments take precedence over lectures and conferences, the hospital and attending physicians are encouraged to allow the students to attend scheduled lectures. The director of the individual clinical service must approve absences from clinical duty in advance. 5.6.3 Standa rds of Professional Conduct As healthcare practitioners, students are required to conform to the highest stand ards of ethical and profession al conduct. Th ese includ e, but are not limit ed to: Respect of colleagues, staff, patients, & faculty Flexibility Academic integrity Honesty & trustwo rthiness Accountabili ty for personal actions & ral compet ency Students are exp ected to adhere to the s ame high ethical and p rofession al standards required of p racticing physi cians. The pr ofession al condu ct of is evaluated on an ongoing b asis thr oughout the did actic and clinical years of the CUSOM pr ogram. Violations of sta ndards of condu ct are subj ect to faculty review and may be referred to the Ac ademic P erformance, Promotion and Sta ndards (APPS) Committee . Appropriate behavior regarding patients, staff, and other clinici ans is expected in all situations. P receptors are instructed to report any attendance, appearance, or behavioral probl ems to the R egional Dean/DSME and Office of Clinic al Affairs immedi ately. 137 5.6.4 Preceptor - Stud ent Interactions The student should maintain a professional relationship with the preceptor and adhere to appropriate professional boundaries at all times . Contact through web - based social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) should be avoided . Career networking through professional sites, such as LinkedIn, is acceptable. All students must refrain from any inappropriate relationship with students/facu lty/staff/preceptors to the extent the relationship may compromise any policies or expectations of the University or as noted elsewhere in this bulletin . Inappropriate relationships include any romantic or physically intimate liaison with a student outsid e the bonds of marriage. CUSOM maintains a faculty recusal policy which requires a ny CUSOM faculty member , including CUSOM appointed clinical preceptors, with a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship with a current CUSOM student to recuse themselves from all activities involving the summative assessment, grading, and promotion of that student. For the purposes of this policy, a \"therapeutic relationship\" occurs when a licensed clinician assumes the responsibility for the evaluation, diagno sis, or management of a student's medical or behavioral health condition. Any student working with a clinical preceptor with whom they have a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship should contact the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs at the beginn ing of the rotation so they may identify an alternative clinical practice or service for the student's rotation, or in cases when that is not feasible, identify another preceptor on the rotation to complete the end of rotation evaluation. 5.6.5 Dress Code CUSOM recogniz es the importan ce rofession al appearance in maint aining an atmosph ere conducive to the deliv ery of qu ality h ealth care. Students are always expected to d ress in a p rofession al and appropriate manner in accordance with Section 6.5 of this Bulletin . Please note , business attire is appropriate for all clinical rotations . All students are expected to wear business casual attire appropriate for a professional setting unless otherwise directed by their clinical preceptor. Jeans, t-shirts , and flip -flops are not permitted. Closed -toe shoes are required. Shoes should be professional (no tennis shoes), comfortable and functional. The student must wear profession al attire as desc ribed in th e Section 6.5 of this Bulletin. CLEAN , short, white lab coats with a Campbell University patch are required at all times. If the CUSOM embroidered lab coat is dirty, students are permitted to wear a non -Campbell -issued , short, white lab coat until the original coat is cleaned. Students must wear their CUSOM ID badge at all times as noted below. 138 On serv ices where scrubs are indi cated, they will be prov ided by the training facility. S crubs are not to be worn outside of the t eaching fa cility. Stud ents will wear appropriate p rofession al attire to and from the institution. Approved identi fication will be worn as dict ated by each training facility. Students are required to also wear their CUSOM identifi cation (ID) badges at all times. In cases of lost ID badges, students must contact CUSOM to obtain a new ID badge. If students arrive without a lab coat or are inappropriately dressed, they may be asked to leave the rotation and may NOT be allowed to participate in clinical activities. This may result in an unexcused absence and will require fu rther action and review by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Inappropriate dress may also be considered a professionalism issue and may be referred to the Academic Performa nce, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Commit tee. Good personal hygiene is expected. Students must not wear overpowering cologne or perfume . Scrubs are to be worn ONLY on services in which they are indicated, in which case they will be prov ided by the training facility . They are not to be worn home or into the hospital from outside. New scrubs must be worn daily. Surgical head and footgear is not to be worn outside of the operating room area. Failure to adhere to these standa rds of dress and grooming may result in corrective action as noted above. 5.6.6 Supervision of Students The student, while on a clinical rotation, will at all times be responsible to the personnel in charge of the service involved. In addition, all students are expected to comply with the policies and procedures established by the hospital or clinic at which they are being trained. If a student has any questions or concerns regarding the policy or their role as a student, they should immediately contact the Regional Dean/DSME or the Director of Medical Education Office of the affiliated hospital, and the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs. All CUSOM student s on clinical rotations must be supervised in all patient care situations by a CUSOM -appointed physician/faculty member or other appropriate health care provider who is respon sible to: Be physically located in the facility where patient treatment is rendered; Grant authori zation of s ervices provid ed by the student ; Examine all patients seen by the student ; Supervise procedures performed by CUSOM students. Under NO circumstances are students to attempt a procedure without the appropriate direct supervision. ; and Assure that the document ation in the patient's medi cal record is appropriate. 139 5.6.7 Stud ent Problems / Issues The Office of Clinical Affairs makes every effort to ensure all clinical rotations are positive learning experiences. However, if any problems/concerns arise during the clinical years, students should contact the Office of Clinical Affairs for assistance as soon as they arise. In addition, counseling services are available to all students on rotations as noted in Section 5. 7.3 of this Bulletin. If a preceptor suspects or identifies problems with a student's progress, professionalism , or performance they are to contact the Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Affairs. All reports will be thor oughly inv estigated and, should action be required , the appropriate pr ocedures, as outlined in Section 6.7 of this Bulletin , will be followed. Examples of such problems may include, but are not limited to: Poor interpersonal skills (i.e., personality problems, etc.); Deficient clinical skills ; Below average clinical knowledge or academic performance; Unexcused absenteeism; Suspected m edical or psychological illness ; ance illegal behavior; or Susp ected physical, sexual, or emotional abuse. If at any time, the Office of Clinical Affairs or other faculty member feels a student is unfit physically, mentally, or emotionally to care for patients, the student will be removed from rotations and required to meet with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs to determine the appropriate course of action. If a student has concerns about their own well -being, they should contact the Of fice of Clinical Affairs and access CUSOM p rovided Behavioral Health counseling services as noted in Section 5.7.3 of th is Bulletin . 5.6.8 Letters of Recommendation The Office of Clinical Affairs does not provide letters of recommendation for students seeking post -doctoral training. Students should identify faculty members who will advocate for their suitability in the various specialties. Letters of recommendation should be forwarded directly to the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS). Do not have these letters sent to the Office of Clinical Affairs. CUSOM will provide the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE) as part of all student residency applications. As the name signifies, this is a standardized instrument of evaluation a nd not a letter of recommendation. 140 5.6.9 Stud ent Records Student evaluations (PES) are available for rev iew acc ording to CUSOM policy. Grades cannot be given by phone. Student evaluations (PES) and grades are maintained in the Office of C linical Affairs. Student files are CONFIDENTIAL and will not be cop ied by personnel of the Office of Clinical Affairs or sent to another party for externship/internship applications. However, students will be allowed to download a copy of their own evalua tions. Student transcripts will remain under the aegis of the Registrar's Office. C omments provided by preceptors on the s tudent end -of-rotation evaluation will be included in the MSPE. 5.6.10 History and Physicals CUSOM believes in the importance of an ed ucationally sound policy pertaining to student performa nce of History and Physical examinations (H&P' s) at affiliated tra ining sites. I deally, t he H&P policy should be the same for all student s. However, we realize the sov ereignty of our affiliated hospitals and acknowle dge our policy must be in tegrated with individual hospital policy. I deally, the student should complete at least two H&P's per day on each assig ned service. The student, according to the rules and regulations of the training institution, may sign History and Physical (H&P) notes. The H&Ps performed and documente d by students must be reviewed and countersigned by the supervising physicia n. Progress notes may be written by students only under the direct supervision of the supervising physician and must be countersigned within the time required by the rules and regulatio ns of the training institution. At no time do student notes serve as the physician preceptor's notes. The Office of the Director of Medical Education or Regional Dean/DSME are responsible for the student documentation policy for each hospital. I f a student has any questions or concerns regarding the policy or their role as a student, they should contact the Regional Dean/DSME or the Director of Medical Education Office of the affiliated hospital. 5.6.11 Patient Care Orders Students shall not order any examinations, tests, medications, or procedures without consulting and obtaining the prior approval of the supervising physician. 141 The Director of Medical Education or Regional Dean/DSME for each specific hospital will make clear to the student the policy of the respective hosp ital for student order writing. As students are not licensed physicians, all activities (orders, any patient care, procedures, progress notes, etc.) in the clinical setting are under the supervision of a CUSOM -appointed fa culty member or other appropriate health care provider who assumes responsibility for the student. Students must perform procedures under appropriate and proper supe rvision, within the scope of practice of their supervising preceptor, and only in those areas where the training institution regulations permit them to do so. 5.6.12 Prescription W riting Students may write or input electronic prescription information only with preceptor approval , but the physician must sign/send all pre scriptions. The student's name is not to ap pear on t he prescription. For clinical rotation sites which use electronic prescriptions, the precept or MUST log into the sys tem under their own password and personally s ign and send the electron ic prescription. 5.6.1 3 Medical Care & Medication Samples Students may not seek medi cal care from a preceptor, colleagues, or staff. The o nly exception is emergency situations where the preceptor is the only qualified licensed provi der to give care. Any student working with a clinical preceptor with whom they have a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship should contact the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs at the beginning of the rotation so they may identify an alternative clinical practice o r service for the student's rotation, or in cases when that is not feasible, identify another preceptor on the rotation to complete the end of rotation evaluation. Students may only provide sample medications to patients under the direction and supervision of the supervising physician. Students may not take any medication or supplies from a clinical rotation site for personal use. Any student violating these guidelines on drug samples will autom atically fail that rotation and be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Com mittee. 142 5.6.1 4 Heal th Insu rance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Student phys icians must be c ognizant of and comply with HIPAA. This will be in accordance with the traini ng institution rules and regulations and state and federal regulations as they a pply. HIPAA training will be completed by the student prior to starting both third -year and fourth -year clinical rotations. Any HIPAA violation may result in referral to the Aca demic Performa nce, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Commit tee, and depending on the clinical site's policy, may result in student removal and assignment to another rotation site. 5.6.1 5 Medicare Policy The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) revised the Medicare Claims Processing Manual in early 2018 to update policy on Evaluation and Management (E/M) documentation to allow the teaching physician to verify in the medical record any student documentation of components of E/M services rather tha n re-documenting the work. Students may document in the medical record , however, the supervising physician must verify in the medical record all student documentation or findings, including history, physical exam, and/or medical decision making. The supervising physician must personally perform (or re -perform) the physical exam and medical decision -making activities of the E/M service being billed but may verify any student documentation of them in the medical record rather than re -documenting this work. Direct access to CMS rules regarding student documentation can be found on the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) website . 5.6.16 Change of Address Students must notify the Office of Clinical Affairs , Office of Student Affairs, and the Registrar of any change in mailing address during the clinical rotation years. This may be done via a Wufoo form. A link to this form may be found on CUSOM's web -based evaluation system. 143 Students m ay contact the Office of Clinical Affairs at: Campbell Un iversity School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUSOM) Office of Clinic Office of Clinical Affairs will use CUSOM email as an official form of communication with students during clinical rotations. All students are required to check their CUSOM email daily , including weekend s and holidays, while on all rotations and to respond to email requests within twenty -four (24) hours . Students are asked to acknowledge any email se nt specifically to them (non -group emails) with a s imple reply to ens ure the email was received. If a student is located in a site with no/limited internet access, they must in form the Office of Clinical Affa irs immediately. Repeated offenses for not replying to CUSOM email in a timely manner may result in a referral to the Academic Performance Prom otion and Standards (APPS) Committee for a breach in professionalism . Policy on Student Response to CUSOM Request for Information Whenever this Academic Bulletin requires the student to provide a written response to be received by CUSOM on or before a certain date, CUSOM will not grant exceptions to the stated deadline except in the case of a medical emergency, and in that case, the student must provide the response as soon as medically feasible. 5.6.18 Cell Phone Calls / Text Messages It is inappropria te, unpr ofessional, and disrespectful to te xt message, c heck social media sites or email, or u se cell phone s or any ot her devices for purposes other than educational in nature while on clinical rotations. If the prece ptor approves, e lectronic devices with internet capabilities may be used as a clinical re source (i.e., medical applications). Students who text message or use the ir cell phone for non -educa tional purposes are subject to disciplinary action, may be re ferred to the Academic Performa nce, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Commit tee for un profes sional cond uct, and their behavior may also be ref lected in a negative e valuation fr om the preceptor. All preceptor comments on student evaluations (PES) are includ ed in the MSPE. 144 5.6.19 Social Media Students may not post any patient or rotation -specific information on social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc.). Contact through we b-based social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) should be avoided with all employees of clinical sites as well as program faculty a nd staff. Career networki ng through professional sites, such as LinkedIn, is accep table. Students should NEVER post any patient -related information or commentary even if the patient name is not included. Students should avoid all perception of impropriety, such as pictures suggesti ng com promisi ng states or alcohol. Violation of these gu idelines may result in referral of the stude nt to the Academic Performance Prom otion and Standards (APPS) Committee for professionalism and Code of Conduct violations . 5.6.20 Housing Students must provide for their housing during their enrollment at CUSOM. This includes during the clinical training years at the student's respective clinical campus. During the clinical years, students can be expected to drive up to one hour from the premier educational partner of their region to complete a rotation. If a student must be displaced for a core or selective rotation due to rotation capacity, then CUSOM will cover the cost of housing through their membership with the AHEC. CUSOM will not provide the housing cost for a student displaced for a rotation due to remediation due to a clinical rotation failure or to complete an elective. Students can request AHEC housing for elective/away rotations. AHEC cannot bill students directly to students, a repayment agreement has been created where the University will bi ll the AHEC housing expense directly to the student 's account. Once AHEC housing has been secured, students must complete the AHEC Housing Repayment Agreement form and submit it to the Director of Clinical Affairs. If a student requests AHEC housing and needs to cancel or modify the request, the student must contact AHEC to request changes. Students are responsible for all AHEC housing charges if they register for housing and do not cancel the request if housing is not needed. 145 5.6.21 Other Regulations and Procedures The study and training of each student during assignment to a training institution shall be governed by the followi ng regulations: A CUSOM -appointed, licensed physician or faculty member must supervise students. Students shall assume responsibility for and perform , their assigned duties in accordance with the training institution regulatio ns. Students are not permitted to accept financial compensation or any form of gratuity for ren dering patient care. Students should be assigned to specific patients by their faculty preceptor . H&P exams should be completed on those patients whom students will be following on the service they are ass igned. Emphasis will be placed on the teaching and application of osteopathic principles and practice. Palpation and structural diagnosis in the narrative form shall be an integral part of the history and phys ical examination. The student, accordi ng to the rules and regu lations of the traini ng institution, may sign H&P's. The H&P's performed and documented by stu dents must be reviewed and countersig ned by the su pervising physician. Progress no tes may be written by students only under t he direct supervision of the supervising physician and must be c ountersig ned within the time required by the rules and regu lations of the training institution. Students shall not order any examinations, tests, medications, or proce dures without consulting and obtaining the prior approval of the supervising phys ician. Students may only write or input electronic prescription information with preceptor approval, but the physician must sign/send all prescriptions. The student's name is not to appear on the prescription. For clinical rotation sites w hich use electronic prescriptions, the preceptor MUST log into the system under their own password and personally sign and send the electronic prescription. Attendance by students is required at all conferences, discussions or study session s, and any other programs of an educational nature designed specif ically for students and should be documented with an attendance rec ord. In a ddition, students are encouraged to attend lectures for inter ns and residents provided these do not interfere with the student's own program. Students are required to participate in utilizing osteopat hic manipulative treatment when ordered and supervised by t he atte nding phys ician. Students shall learn and perform procedures under appropriate and proper supervision, in those areas w here the training institution regulations permit such instruction. 146 Every eff ort should be made to counsel and assist students having difficulty in a particular service. Stude nts who are particularly adept in a specif ic service should be given additional o pportunities to learn at the di scretion of the appropriate supervis ing physicians and the Director of Medical Education in accordance with hosp ital or clinic regulations. Students must cond uct themselves in a courteo us and professional manner and shall fol low the dress co de of the training institution and CUSOM at all times . 5.7 Clinical Rotations Health and Wellness 5.7.1 Vaccination Record Students must complete and maintain all vaccination requirements/records as required in the CUSOM matriculation agreement (See Section 3.16.1) . Failure to do so will jeopardize starting or ongoing partic ipation in clinical rotations. Students are responsible for keeping their PPDs current according to th e guidelines set forth by the CDC (within one (1) year of their last PPD) and according to the process documented in Section 3.16.1 of this Bulletin . This documentation pertaining to the update must be submitted to the Office of Clinical Affairs prior to the student continuing on their rotation schedule. Inability to participate in required clinical experiences due to noncompliance with CUSOM vaccination policies may result in unexcused absences leading to failure of a course, Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee hearing, Academic Probation, Suspension, delay in graduation, or even Dismissal from the program. 5.7.2 Heal th Services CUSOM students are able to utilize the Campbell University Health Center for confidential diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic medical services and personal health concerns. Student Health Center office hours are published and distributed to students at the start of each academic year and may be found online at the Health Center's website . All students are required to have health insurance at the time of matriculation and maintain health insurance coverage through graduation. Students are required to either enroll in Campbell University's health insurance plan or provide proof of active health insurance coverage obtained through another company. Students without active health insurance coverage will not be permitted to participate in any patient care clinical activities. 147 For medical emergencies and after -hours health care, students are encouraged to access appropriate care as warrante d by their situation which may include local urgent care facilities, Emergency Departments , and Emergency Medical Services. In an emergency, students should access EMS and the 911 -dispatch system. For students on clinical rotations away from CUSOM needin g diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic health services, assistance may be obtained anytime by contacting the Regional Dean/DSME or the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs. CUSOM will assume no financial responsibility for injuries (e.g., accidental needle sticks, burns, laceration, etc.) or medical/surgical problems incurred either on or off a clinical rotation. For this reason, the student is required to keep enforced a health insurance policy throughout every year in attendance at CUSOM. Proof of insurance information is to be provided to the Office of Clinical Affairs yearly and updated on an ongoing basis if there are any changes in coverage. 5.7.3 Counseling Services CUSOM's Department of Behavioral Health provides support and counseling services to students for concerns including, but not limited to burnout, fatigue mitigation, anxiety, depression, academic difficulty and performance, study strategies, relationship/f amily difficulties, stress and anger management, and adjustment to illness and lifestyle changes.

As stated in Section of 5.1.3 of this Bulletin, s tudents are not protected by malp ractice insurance provided by Campbe ll Un iversity while engaged in physician shadowing experiences unless the experience is with a CUSOM- appointed faculty memb er and as a part of the curriculum . Students are required to let non -CUSOM ap pointed physicians they are shadowing know that th ey are not covered by malp ractice insurance provid ed by Campbell University. Students working in the CU Health Center or volunteering at the CUCCC are covered by the professional liability insurance of the Campbell University Health Center, LLC. Any incidents, which may bear a medico -legal impact, occurring in the clinical interaction with patients must be immediately reported to the clinical supervisor on-site, the Office of Clinical Affairs, the Regional Dean/Director of Student Medical Education (DSME) , the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, and the Campbell University General Counsel's Office at PO Box 114, Buies Creek, NC 27506, (910) 893 -1217. 5.7.5 Body Fluid and Needle Stick Policy and Procedure Incid ents involving needle sticks and exposure to body fluids or potential blood-borne pathogens require immedi ate action to prot ect the health and safety of students, faculty and staff . Per CDC recommendations, post -exposure prophylaxis should be administered within hours of an exposure if the source patient is deemed high risk for having a blood -borne infectious disease, or if there is uncertainty of the source patient's status. CDC gui delines for the prevention of blood -borne infectious disease following an exposure are found at the CDC Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure website . Post-exposu re prophylaxis for HIV, when indicated, is extremely time sensitive with b est results obtain ed when treatment is begun within just a few hours of exposu re. Thus, immediate evaluation following an incident is critical. In the event of an exposure, the National Clinician's Post Exposure Prophylaxis Hotline is available by phone, (888) 448 -4911, twenty -four hours per day, seven days per week , to provide guidance in managing exposures. 151 If a student , faculty, or staff member sustains a needle stick or is exposed to infectious mat erials, they should: Immediately wash exposure site thoroughly with soap and water (or water only for mucous me mbranes). o Wash needle stick and cuts with so ap and water. o Flush the nose, mouth , or skin with w ater. o Irrigate eyes with clean water, saline, or sterile irrigating solutions . Immediately notify the preceptor or clinical supervisor at the rotation site for assistan ce. Call/go to the Campbell University's Health Center or the occupational health clinic or area of the clinical facility designated for treating needle stick exposur es. Time ly consultation concerning appropriate tests, risk-assessment couns eling, and chemoprophylaxis decisions are critical. Proceed to the Emergency Department for evaluation if exposure has occurred after normal business hours or if for any other r eason, unable to be evaluated at one of the above locations. Seek immedi ate care for necessary lab work and post -exposure prophylaxis if indicated. Information for Students on Clinical Rotations In addition to the above procedures, the following guidelines apply to students on clinical rotations exposed to potentially infectious blood or body fluid pathogens: In the event the clinical rotation site has an existing exposure policy, the student should follow the site's policy. If the rotation site is not able to perform a timely assessment and/or provide treatment, the student should immediately seek care at the nearest available facility , which may be an Emergency Department, to provide appropriate care (initial lab work for HI V, HBV, HCV, and risk assessment to determine the need for chemoprophylaxis, etc.) . Students may also be seen at Campbell University's Health Center. The preceptor or appropriate institutional representative at the site where the exposure occurred should obtain consent from the source patient for appropriate laboratory testing (i.e. , HIV, HBV, and HCV status). Some clinical sites will provide post -exposure care to students at no charge. When this is not the case, students should file a claim with their personal health insurance or Campbell University Student Health Insurance first. However, submission of insurance information should never delay an initial evaluation or in itiation of appropriate care and/or post -exposure prophylaxis. 152 Accidental in fectious exposure must also be reported to A -G: A-G Administrators LLC PO Box 21013 Eafan, MN 55121 Number: US1529251 When presenting to a clinic for post-exposure care, the student may provide the above A-G policy information and his or her student ID card. However, the site may or may not accept direct payme nt through this pl an. Students may have to pay out of pocket at the time of service. Campbell University Health Center personnel will provide further instruction on how to compl ete and file your claim. If requested, mail documents to : Campbell Univ ersity Health C enter P.O. Box 565 Buies Creek, NC 27506 Exposure Reporting and Follow -up Althou gh the preceptor or clinical supervisor may contact the CUSOM Offic e of Clinic al Affairs as indicated above, the student must also contact the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs and complete the Incident Report Form (available on CUSOM's web -based evaluation system and in the Department of Clinical Affairs) within 72 hours of the incident . In addi tion, w ithin seventy -two (7 2) hours of the exposu re, the student must report the incid ent and then provide a copy of the Incident Report Form to the Campbell University Health Center, attention to \"Front Desk Staff\", at (910) 893-7254. The incident report, Exposure Reporti ng Form - CU Health Center, contain s: The date and time of exposure ; Clini cal site, location and unit info rmation ; Details of how the exposure occurred; Details of the type and severity of the exposure ; and Details about the source patient (i.e. Post-exposure management, previous vaccinations, current HIV, HBV, HCV status) . The Office of Clinical Affairs will also provide a copy of the incident report to the Campbell University Health Center. This will alert the Health Center in the event an accident insurance claim needs to be filed. In the event an incident report was filed at the rotation site, a copy must be sent to the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs to be mai ntained in the student's file. 153 In the event of an exposure, the National Clinician's Post Exposure Prophylaxis Hotline is available by phone, (888) 448-4911 , twenty -four hours per day, seven days per week, to provide guidance in managing exposures. 5.7.6 Infectious Dis eases The risk of exposure to, and transmission of, infectious diseases can be greatly decreased by the combination of several simple, but effective, measures including ongoing education and training, adherence to universa l precautions, and vaccination. All CUSOM students receive OSHA/Blood -borne Patho gen Training on matriculation and annually through graduation. Clinical faculty complete infection prevention training as required by their specific healthcare system or clinical practice. In addition, unless granted an exemption (See Section 3.16.1), CUSOM students must obtain all required vaccinations and corresponding titers prior to matriculation and remain compliant with all vaccination requirements through graduation in order to complete all clinical requirements in the CUSOM curriculum. Descriptio ns of CUSOM current vaccination and testing requirements, including those addressing Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Varicella, Hepatitis B, Influenza, and COVID -19 and Tuberculosis are delineated in the CUSOM Immunization Policy a nd annual Academic Bulletin , Section 3.16 . Diseases that may be acquired in the healthcare setting include, but are not limited to : Needle sticks, and Blood and Body Fluid Exposures Hepatitis B Hepatitis C HIV Aerosol and Droplet Exposures Tuberculosis Measles Chickenpox Meningococcus Pertussis Influenza Rubella Lassa Transmission Salmon Shigella Cryptosporidiosis Enterovirus Adenovirus Hepatitis A and Mucous Membrane Exposure Herpes Simplex Staphylococcus aureus A Streptococcus Keratoconjunc tivitis (Simple and Epidemic) Syphilis Scabies Diseases students can transmit to patients or other healthcare personnel include , but are not limited to : Respiratory Route Tuberculosis Influenza Measles Chickenpox Rubella SARS CoV -2 Herpes Simplex Enteric Infections Gram-negative Bacilli Staphylococcus aureus Drug Resistant Bacteria Monkey pox Hepatitis B Group A Strep Clostridium difficile Keratoconjunctivitis (Simple and Epidemic) Scabies 5.7.7 Standard Precautions The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has developed precautions to prevent accidental spread of infectious disease in healthcare settings. These include standard precautions for all patient care and transmission -based precautions for situations in which sp ecific infections are identified or suspected. A comprehensive description of these precautions is found on the CDC website . Standard precautions make use of common -sense practices an d personal protective equipment to protect healthcare providers from infection and prevent the spread of infection and include, but are not limited to, the following principles: Handwashing o Handwashing is one of the most important methods of preventing the transmission of disease. o Always wash your hands before and after examining a patient, between patient contact, immediately after removing gloves, and after touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions and contaminated items. o Comprehensive CDC gu idelines for hand hygiene in healthcare settings are found on the CDC website . 155 Wear gloves for contact with mucous membranes, non -intact skin, blood, body fluids, secretions, and contamin ated items. Masks, goggles, and face masks should be worn to protect mucous membranes of the eyes, nose and mouth when contact with blood or body fluids is likely. Gowns should be worn to protect the skin and prevent soiling of clothing during procedures p ossibly involving contact with blood or body fluid. Handling sharps o Use great care when handling needles or sharp instruments. o Never attempt to recap a needle. o Avoid removing used needles from disposable syringes o Dispose of all sharps (used or unused) only in puncture -resistant containers. Know where the container is located BEFORE using needles or sharp instruments. o Don't use needle cutters and don't try to bend or break needles. o Be careful when cleaning up after lumbar punctures, thoracentesis, bone marro w biopsies or any other procedures in which sharps or needles were used. o Don't hide needles under drapes or packaging. o In the case of an accidental needle stick: Thoroughly clean the wound immediately Follow the needle stick/exposure procedure delineated above o Additional information is available on the CDC website . Soiled linens and patient care equipment should be handled in a manner to prevent contact with skin or mucous membranes and to prevent contamina tion of clothing or the environment. Environmental Cleaning - routinely care, clean and disinfect equipment and furnishings in patient care areas. Patient resuscitation - use mouthpieces, resuscitation bags, or other ventilation devices to avoid mouth - to-mouth resuscitation. Additional Steps to Help Preventing Infectious Disease Transmission Observe Isolation Procedures o Isolation procedures are based on a large body of scientific work and detailed guidelines are provided by on the CDC website . o Each isolation category specifies whether gloves, gowns, masks, and/or goggles are necessary when in close contact with the patient or entering the room. o Isolation is intended for appropriate patients whether they are alive or deceased. All specimens taken from isolated patients must be designated as isolation specimens and placed in the appropriate protective bags or containers. The lab must be aware a specimen is from an isolation patient as body fluids can be haz ardous when spilled, splattered, or aerosolized in the lab. o A copy of the infection control manual and isolation category cards are available in every healthcare facility. 156 If you are sick, don't be a vector to patients, students, faculty, staff, or other h ealthcare workers o If you are ill, consult a physician. o Wear a mask if you have a respiratory illness or stay at home. o Students, faculty, and staff must follow all CUSOM and facility - specific COVID -related policies including those requiring the need to sta y home, isolate, or quarantine in the case of COVID -related symptoms, exposures, or positive testing. o Practice frequent handwashing. o If you have a contagious disease or have been exposed to one, inform your supervisor and the Office of Clinical Affairs immediately. 5.8 Hospital / Clinical Facility Information 5.8.1 Clinical Stud ent Preparation All t hird- and fourth -year medical students have successfully completed two years of didactic education which prepares them for clinical rotations. In addition to passing all required course work, all students beginning clinical rotations have completed the following: Criminal Ba ckground Check and Substance Abuse S creen Students have completed a background check prior to matriculating to CUSOM and again prior to clinical rotations. A substance abuse screen is completed before matriculation and again before the beginning of the third year. Students may be required to submit to additional substa nce abuse testing at any time, including during the clinical years depending on the clinical site protocols, and any additional substance abuse screens will be at the student's expense . Vaccinations Before starting clinical rotations , all students are re quired to provide a completed medical history form and proof of vaccinations to the Campbell University Health Center . A completed physical examination form is required for students and is kept on file. Students must maintain compliance with all CUSOM vaccination policies in order to complete all required supervised clinical practice experiences. All students must have provided proof of adequate vaccination /immunity for the following: 1. Diphth eria, Pertussis, Tetanus 2. Measles, Mumps, R ubella 3. Varicella 4. Hepatitis B 157 5. Influenza (annual vaccine) 6. Tuberculosis ( TB) skin test (twice given 2 weeks apart) using a two -step tuberculin skin test or via a single Interferon -Gamma Release Assay blood test. -- If a student has had a positive TB test, a chest x -ray report must be received as well as an annual questionnaire. 7. COVID -19 (SARS CoV -2) Unless granted an exemption (See Section 3.16.1), Campbell University and as such, CUSOM , requires all students to either show proof of full vaccination for COVID -19 or present proof of a negative test for COVID -19 within 48 hours of returning to campus. 8. Some clinical sites require evidence of full vaccination, which may include one or more boosters . As such, students are required to be fully vaccinated for those specific locations. 9. Non-compliance with CUSOM Vaccination Requirements may result in the inability to participate in any clinical experiences, including, but not limited to, standardized patie nt OSCEs, early clinical experiences, and clinical rotations. This may result in unexcused absences leading to failure of a course or clinical rotation(s), referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee, Academic Probation, Suspension, delay in graduation, or even Dismissal from the program. Annual Influenza Vaccination Requirement For your own health and safety as well as that of the patients you serve, all students are required to obtain an annual influenza vaccination. The CDC cites yearly influenza vaccinations as the first step to helping protect yourself as well as others arou nd you from contracting the influenza virus. Additional information regarding influenza vaccination is available on the CDC website . Proof of annual influenza vaccine is due to the Office of Clinical Affairs no later than November 15 of each year. Certifications/Trainings All students beginning clinical rotations will have successful ly completed the followi ng certifications /trainings prior to th eir clinical rotation Life Suppo rt; Advanced Cardiac Life Suppo rt; HIPAA Training (completed annually) ; and OSH Training (completed annually) . 158 5.8.2 Credentiali ng of Medical Students at Affiliated Sites CUSOM works with each affiliated healthcare site to ensure proper credentialing of all medical students is completed prior to the start of the students ' scheduled clinical rotations. Credentialing ensures CUSOM assists its affiliated sites in providing the best possible clinical rotation experiences for CUSOM medical st udents while assisting them in maintaining the highest quality care and safety for their patients and hospital staff. All CUSOM affiliated healthcare sites receive up -to-date and accurate personal information for all CUSOM medical students participating i n clinical rotations at their facilities. This credentialing information ensures all CUSOM medical students are granted proper access to the facility's physician's portal (per facility policies) , teaching faculty, clinical areas, dining facilities, medica l library, physician's lounge, and employee parking (list may vary depending on site). CUSOM has designated affiliated site liaisons who work with the site's Office of Staff Development or Human Resources department, Public Safety department, and Informat ion Technology department to obtain required credentialing forms as well as create a streamlined process for student credentialing. Some of the CUSOM student personal information used for credentialing may inclu de, but is not limited to : Student clerkship application; Letter of Good Standi ng; Up-to-date Vaccination Records (to include PPD, Varicella Titer, COVID -19, and flu shot during flu season); Substance Abuse Screening Results; Crimin al Background Check Results; Proof of BLS Certification; Proof of ACLS Certification; and Student photo graph. It is the policy of most of CUSOM's affiliated healthcare sites that all CUSO M- generate d paperwor k (vaccination records, substance abuse screen panel results, crimin al backg round check results, p roof of BLS & ACL S) required for crede ntialing is kept on file in CUS OM's Office of Clinic al Affairs. In all cases, CUSOM is able to provide this paperwork upon the affiliated site's request. 5.8.3 Personal Health Insurance All C USOM medical students are required to maintain health insurance coverage through graduation . All students must either provide proof of health insurance or purchase the health insurance available through the University. Proof of insurance must be provided to the Office of Clinical Affairs on a yearly basis with ongoing updates for any change in coverage. Any medical costs 159 incurred by students while in training, including those as a result of needle sticks or exposure to infectious diseases or materials, are the responsibility of the student and their health insurance carrier. 5.8.4 Hospital Training Program Structure Students will be assigned to a patient care team comprised of physicians and residents or interns. This structure will provide all participants with clearly delineated responsibilities for meeting educational objectives. During their third year, all students will complete at least one clinical rotation under the supervision of an osteopathic physician and at least two rotations which include an inpatient experience. Prior to their fourth -year clinical rotations, all students will work with a resident physician(s) currently enrolled in an accredited program of graduate medical education. 5.8.5 Administrative Functions The hospital/training site, in concert with the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs, will specifically define the degree of student participation in its own institution. Standards for medical students should be consistent regardless of their school of origin . CUSOM and each participating hospital will identify the personnel involved in teaching programs, including administrative personnel. Program coordination will be through the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs and the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Program content, structure , and evaluation will be the responsibility of the appropriate departments of the hospital and approved by CUSOM. Any difficulties in the program should be immediately communicated to the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs. 5.8.6 Orientation At the start of clinical rotations , students will receive a hospital/clinical site orientatio n and compl ete all adminis trative requirements, includ ing obtaining a name badge and computer passwo rd, compl eting any necessary paperwor k, EMR training, and additional site-specific HIPAA training, if needed. At the beginning of the clinical rotation, it is recommended the precep tor and student meet to formulate mutu al goals in regar d to what they hope to achieve during the rotation. The preceptor should communic ate their expectations of the student during the rotation. These may include topics such as : Clinical h ours; Interactions with o ffice and profession al staff; General attendance; Call schedules ; 160 Overnight/weekend schedules ; Participation during rounds and conferences; Expectations for clinical care, patient int eraction, and procedures; Oral presentations ; Written document ation - electronic medical record s (EMR ) and handwritten notes; Assignments and write-ups; and Any additional duti es necessary for learning purposes. Students will comply with all requirements related to patient care as establish ed by the hospital/ training site. The student's orientation should also include a review of the physical plant. This may include, but is not limited to patient rooms, nursing stations, Emergency Department, ancillary services facilities (radiology, laboratory, etc.), rest rooms, lounges, cafeteria or coffee shop, and library. 5.8.7 Stud ent Requirements The specific objectives are defined for all core rotations in the rotation syllabi. The followi ng must be subm itted to the Office of Clinical Affairs for a student to receive credit for the rotation: Student p erformance evaluation (i.e., the Preceptor Evaluation of Student (PES) Form); Clini cal experience database (i.e., Patient Logs); and Site evaluation (i.e., the Student Ev aluation of Site (SES) Form and the Student Evaluation of Preceptor (SEP) Form). Additional requirements may be incorporated into specific rotations. The student will attend educational lectures and seminars offered at the hospital/training site. Students will be evaluated by each of the responsible individuals on the teaching servic e through periodic oral evaluation and observation of performance. Clinical faculty preceptors on the teaching service will complete a specific evaluation form provided by CUSOM for evaluation of student performance based on the AACOM core competencies. Students will also be evaluated on core rotations by computer -based testing at the end of the rotation. 5.8.8 Informed Patient Cons ent Regarding Stud ent Involv ement in Patient Care Patients are essential partners in this educational endeavor. Efforts must be made to observe strict confidentiality, respect patient privacy and dignity, and honor their preferences regarding treatment. Patients must be informed a student will participate in their care, and the patient's con sent must be obtained. This may be done through standardized forms at admission/ check -in or on a person -by-person basis. The students must be clearly identified as a student, wear their name badge, and verbally identify as such. If the patient requests a 161 physician and refuses the student's services or participation in their care , this request must be honored. Patients must know they will see their regular provider, and they should have an explicit opportunity to decline student involvement. 5.8.9 Medical Records / Charting The responsibility given to students for medical records varies among facilities. Some sites allow students to write full progress notes and orders directly into the patient's chart. When this is allowed, notes must be immediately co-signed by the supervising physician , and th e physician must follow with his or her own note. At no time do student notes serve as the physician preceptor's notes. Billing must be directly related to the services provided and documented by the physici an. Some hos pitals/clinics have separate pages in charts set aside for \"Student Progress Notes\" . These should also be reviewed and co -signed by the attending physician. Policies may vary at different clinical sites; students are required to follow estab lished policy at the training site. Notes are usually written in the SOAP format. If dictation or computerized entry is allowed by students at a particular hospital or clinic, the resulting notes must also be reviewed and approved by the attending physic ian. The student is responsible for obtaining charting instructions from the preceptor or rotation coordinator. The introduction of electronic medical records (EMRs) presents obstacles for students if they lack a password or are not fully trained in the use of a particular institution's EMR system. In these cases, students are encouraged , if permitted by facility policy, to hand write notes , which should be reviewed by preceptors whenever possible for feedback. Hand -written notes must be maintained according to HIPPA principles and must be handled and or disposed of in a way that maintains strict patient confidentiality and conforms to the specific institution's policies. 5.8.10 Supervision of the Student During a student's time at the clinic or hospital, the preceptor must be available for supervision, consultation, and teaching or clearly designate an alternate CUSOM -appointed preceptor. Having more than one clinical preceptor has both the potential to disrupt continuity for the student and the advantage of exposing them to valuable variations in practice style, which can help learners develop the professional approach that bes t fits them. Students may also be given an assignment or be directed to spend time with ancillary staff (x - ray, lab, physical therapy, etc.) as these experiences can also be very valuable. The preceptor should be aware of the student's assigned activiti es at all times. 162 Students are not employees of the hospitals or clinics and, therefore, work entirely under the preceptor's supervision. On each rotation, it is the student's responsibility to ensure the supervising physician or preceptor also sees all of the student's patients. The preceptor must provide direct supervision of technical skills and may allow for increased autonomy in accordance with the student's demonstrated level of expertise. While many CUS OM students have relatives who are physicians and may have been inspired by those family members to pursue osteopathic medicine, students may not complete rotations with a family member as the clinical faculty preceptor of record. This includes family members related by marriage or in-laws. Any stud ent working with a clinical preceptor with whom they have a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship should contact the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs at the beginning of the rotation so they may identify an alternative clinical practice or service for the student's rotation, or in cases when that is not feasible, identify another preceptor on the rotation to complete the end of rotation evaluation. 5.9 Graduate Medical Education CUSOM strives to deve lop and support a sufficient number of residency training positions to support the needs of our graduates and our ability to meet our Mission, reflect our values, and achieve our goals . The Associate Dean for Postgraduate Affairs is respons ible for facilitating residency program development and assisting with the strategies for placement of CUSOM graduates into graduate medical education programs. Regional Deans, who supervise third - and fourth -year student rotations at their site, also ass ist in the development and maintenance of residency training programs. CUSOM's goal is to develop the same or greater number of GME positions as our number of graduates. The C USOM GME programs provide graduating students postgraduate training opportuniti es and help meet the need for future physicians to care for the rural and underserved populations in North Carolina, the Southeastern United States, and the nation. 163 6. Academic Policies and Procedures 6.1 Advising and Tutoring 6.1.1 Advising and Faculty Access CUSOM believes in strong academic counseling and provides students with excellent longitudinal guidance and support starting during the pre - matriculation phase and continuing through graduation. This comprehensive academic counseling process includ es a series of academic transition support activities, mentorship from assigned academic advisors, licensing exam and residency preparation, training and allocation of peer -tutors, as well as individual and group learning enrichment workshops through its A cademic Center of Excellence (CUSOM ACE). Additionally, CUSOM's Clinical Faculty Chairs serve a critical role in advising students as they advance towards graduate medical education and the residency selection process. The sections below describe each sp ecific process, responsible entity, and programs for these academic counseling activities. 6.1.2 Organizational Structure of the Academic Center of Excellence ( ACE ) The CUSOM ACE, under the directorship of the Assistant Dean for Academic Success and the support of an Administrative Assistant, is responsible for the overall academic success of CUSOM students. The CUSOM ACE manages academic support programs and learning services including, but not limited to the peer -tutoring program, study skill developme nt workshops, individual academic coaching, and faculty advising support. The CUSOM ACE also hosts a collection of learning, advising, coaching, and licensing exam preparation resources accessible to the CUSOM community through its electronic subscription s and library. The CUSOM ACE Blackboard community page provides an additional platform for disseminating information as well as promoting collaborative academic interactions. 6.1.3 Academic Transition Activities The CUSOM ACE is responsible for designing and leading activities and programs designed to assist matriculating students develop study skills and techniques, which lead to achieving academic success. Two weeks prior to Orientation of the new incoming clas s, the CUSOM ACE distributes a pre - matriculation reading assignment on the topic of \"The Science and Strategies for Successful Learning and Study.\" This material, prepared by the CUSOM ACE, is a collection of highlights and excerpts from the literature pe rtaining to critical skills essential for academic success in a high -volume, high -paced learning environment. This material provides students with foundational knowledge in areas such as growth mindset, learning styles, metacognition, spaced -repetition pr actice, interleaving learning, etc., which is then expanded 164 upon during Orientation. During Block 1, two (2) study skills workshops are offered to further explore these topics with special discussion on test -taking skills, and \"exam autopsy\" for refining study skills. This series catalyzes students' academic transition process, helps alleviate transition -related stress, and promotes student success. Additional academic skills workshops are also offered at the beginning of Block 2 and Block 5 with emphase s on transitioning to specific phases of the curriculum. The CUSOM ACE also organizes peer forums periodically throughout the academic year to provide near -peer modeling support. 6.1.4 Long -term, Consistent Mentorship from Academic Advisors The academic Advisor -Advisee relationship is one of institutional representatives providing insight or direction to a student for academic, professional, scholarly, and career planning issues. The nature of this direction may be to inform, suggest, counsel, disciplin e, coach, mentor, or even teach. The CUSOM advising process ensures both biomedical science and clinical faculty are involved in student advising and establishing relationships cultivating an atmosphere of trust for meaningful dialogue. The Advisor - Advis ee relationship ensures consistent feedback regarding academic performance and directs the student to additional resources as needed. All advisors play important roles in identifying students experiencing academic, personal, or behavioral health problems and guiding them to CUSOM's Office of Student Affairs for general support, the CUSOM ACE for individual study skill coaching, or to Behavioral Health Services for assessment and appropriate treatment. The Office of Student Affairs assigns academic advisor s, with input and approval from the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, to each incoming CUSOM student. This mentorship is typically carried out through both mandatory group and individual meetings. In the first two years, this is facilitated through designated time on the academic calendar for the advisors to meet with their advisees. The frequency of meetings between students and their advisors during Years 1 and 2 is as follows: During Blocks 1 and 2 of Year 1, students meet with their academic advisors at least once individually, and once in a group setting each Block (4 meetings total). The focus of these meetings is to provide academic support to the students during this transitional period, serve as an opportunity to answer questions, identify student concerns or difficulties, and provide students information regarding helpful CUSOM resources and support services. During Blocks 3 -5, students are required to meet with their advisors at least once each Block in a group setting. Additional indivi dual meetings are arranged based on student needs. 165 In addition to their role as assigned academic advisors, faculty members are also available to meet with students seeking additional guidance or help with course work. Faculty members offer individual of fice hours, and many of them host additional virtual office hours via a teleconference platform, providing students with additional flexibility and opportunities for assistance. The scheduling of these meetings may be done directly with faculty or through a designated administrative assistant. By matriculating at CUSOM, students agree that their grades will be shared with their faculty advisors in an effort to facilitate effective advising. 6.1.5 Licensing Exam and Residency Preparation Support To help guide CUSOM students in preparation and planning for national licensing exams through the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME) and the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME), the CUSOM Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, and the Assistan t Dean for Academic Affairs provide presentations to MS -1 and MS -2 students and offer individualized advisement. These sessions and meetings offer insights, data, and guidance for studying and scheduling COMLEX -USA Level 1 exams and USMLE Step 1 exams . As students enter their third year, additional advising relationships are developed to support clinical rotation needs, residency specialty selection, and the residency application process. Students are provided a list of clinical advisors/mentors with spe cific areas of clinical expertise; in addition, they may choose additional mentors according to their interested clinical discipline. Clinical advisors provide guidance to the students with a focus on the clinical path they are interested in pursuing. CU SOM Clinical Department Chairs provide guidance regarding clinical rotations, addressing any issues with rotation performance and meeting curricular requirements. The Clinical Department Chairs also provide support to students applying to residency progra ms in their specific or related fields by meeting with students to offer advice on residency planning, GME readiness and competitiveness, and providing letters of recommendations for student residency applications. Rising fourth -year students participate in CUSOM's annual Residency Fair, designed to help students narrow down their specialty selection and to prepare for the process of applying to residency programs. This event offers a presentation on criteria to consider when selecting a specialty as well as a panel discussion including residency program directors, current residents from Campbell co -sponsored postgraduate training programs, and fourth -year students in the application process. Participating students can attend breakout sessions for two spe cialties presented by the discipline's Chair, offering information regarding training, job opportunities/outlook, lifestyle etc., evaluation of their competitiveness to that specialty, and advice for the 166 application process. Students also have the chance to talk to Program Directors and staff from residency programs directly. In the first month of their fourth year, all CUSOM medical students complete the Residency Development course (OMED 870) which includes an on - campus, multi -station Objective Structur ed Clinical Exam (OSCE). This multi - station OSCE, also called the Physical Exam -Qualifying Exam (PE -QE), requires students to successfully demonstrate the fundamental clinical skills and physician -related competency domains required for graduation, entran ce into supervised graduate medical education programs, and the provision of safe osteopathic medical care of patients. The Residency Development course also provides a series of lectures designed to prepare students for the residency application process including specialty selection, CUSOM advising and resources, ERAS, residency program interviews, the Match and strategies for success, the SOAP process, and expectations for resident performance when entering residency. Students are provided match reports from the NRMP, information related to the single accreditation system for graduate medical education, resources available through AACOM and the AAMC, curriculum vitae templates and writing support, and a residency application FAQ resource developed by CUS OM. Fourth -year students also participate in mock residency interviews in which they receive immediate feedback on their performance and specific advice regarding targeted areas for improvement in their interviewing skills. In addition to individual meetings with Clinical Chairs, the annual residency fair, and the Residency Development course, students have advising opportunities with CUSOM faculty during the Callback Fridays during their third and fourth years. Callback Fridays are the last Friday o f core clinical rotations when students are required to return to CUSOM to participate in end - of-rotation exams, didactic presentations, Osteopathic Principles & Practices sessions, professional seminars, and clinical faculty advising sessions. 6.1.6 Enrichment and Intervention Support from the Academic Center of Excellence (ACE) Through collaboration with the Department of Behavioral Health, the CUSOM ACE assists students, directly and indirectly, to achieve academic excellence. The Assistant Dean f or Academic Success leads the CUSOM ACE and provides counseling services for study skills, time management, test -taking skills, etc. in group settings or during one -on-one meetings. Individual meetings are scheduled based on need or according to the recom mendations of Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committee or the Dean's office. Students who receive a grade of 75% or less on any integrated exam are encouraged to contact their academic advisors or the CUSOM ACE for an individual mee ting. Meeting frequency is tailored to individual student needs 167 based on academic performance, student requests, recommendations of the ACE, faculty advisors, or the APPS Committee. Students who desire individual advising sessions can schedule meetings w ith their academic advisor or the CUSOM ACE at any time, regardless of their academic performance. Students placed on Academic Probation by the APPS Committee may be required to maintain regular communication with the ACE Director. To maximize the effect iveness of faculty academic advisors, the CUSOM ACE also organizes and participates in Faculty Development sessions to facilitate discussion, share best practices, and offer useful tools for mentoring and coaching the development of master adaptive learners. 6.1.7 CUSOM Peer -Tutor Program The CUSOM ACE develops and manages additional academic support services through the CUSOM Peer -Tutor ing program. The CUSOM Peer -Tutoring program is designed to assist students requesting tutoring service to not only gain more proficiency in subject -specific content but also become more efficient and effective independent learners across a broad range of co urses. Peer tutoring is intended to enhance, not replace lecture attendance and personal study time. Tutors also act as facilitators for student learning, assisting with clarification of lecture and lab objectives, discussions, readings, or other assignm ents. The CUSOM ACE identifies, trains, certifies, and appoints course -specific peer tutors among rising second -year students. To become a certified tutor, students must meet the minimal academic requirements (ranking in the top 20% of a specific course and maintaining a cumulative GPA 3.3) and complete a mandatory Tutor Training Workshop provided by the CUSOM ACE. Certified peer -tutors are processed by the CU Human Resource department and their service financially compensated as graduate student worke rs. CUSOM MS -1 and MS -2 students who wish to receive peer -tutoring support place their requests by logging onto the Blackboard Class Community and completing a request form provided via a Wufoo link. Upon receiving a request, the CUSOM ACE staff will mat ch the requestee/tutee confidentially with an available certified peer -tutor who will then contact the tutee directly to arrange session(s) on a short - or long -term basis. The goal of tutoring sessions is to clarify and review concepts, explain processes, and assist in problem -solving. The interactions between tutor and tutee are required to adhere to the rules of academic professionalism, confidentiality, and honesty according to the CUSOM Honor Code. The most updated CUSOM Peer -Tutor Program manual is published on the CUSOM ACE Community page on Blackboard. 168 As a student -centered institution, all CUSOM faculty and administrators are accessible to students when needed and based on availability. Administrative leadership also strives to conduct informa l meetings with students on a regular basis. In summary, academic advisors, CUSOM Behavioral Health, the Academic Center for Excellence, faculty, Deans, and staff are available to assist students with personal and academic problems that may arise throughout the four years of medical school and provide guidance or referrals to other resources as necessary. 6.1.8 Academic Freedom Policy Students and faculty may not represent themselves verbally, in print, or electronically (including use of Campbell University or CUSOM logos, titles, letterhead, or stationery) as representing Campbell University or CUSOM without the express written permission of the Dean. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. 6.2 Assessment 6.2.1 Global Assessment Throughout the CUSOM curriculum, examinations and other assessments are administered to assess student knowledge , performance , and attainment of the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine program's educational objectives . Students are assessed to gauge satisfactory individual academic progress based on performance on written and practical examinations, Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs), in the clinical setting, and performance on national osteopathic licens ing examinations. The Office of Academic Affairs (including the Registrar), Office of Biomedical Affairs, Office of Clinical Affairs, and the Office of the Dean, work collaboratively with the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards Committee (APPS) Committee to determine each individual student's eligibility for promotion or graduation, consider the results of the student assessments and reports concerning attendance, and monitor conduct and potential professionalism issues. Students who fail to make satisfactory academic progress are addressed through the processes described in this Academic Bulletin. For example, under certain cir cumstances, students may be brought before the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committee for academic review or disciplinary action, with recommendations made to the Dean for final adjudication. 169 Program o utcome objectives have been mapped to the AACOM Core Competencies and the courses in which they are covered, and evaluation strategies are utilized to ensure that all CUSOM graduates achieve the intended learning outcomes. The CUSOM Comprehensive Assessment Plan summarizes addition al methods and metrics which are tracked for continual program evaluation and improvement. Assessment of knowledge is conducted by multiple -choice examinations and quizzes administered at scheduled intervals. Laboratory, including anatomy, OMM, clinical skills, simulation and OSCE assessments are in written or verbal exam format. Assessment of performance on clinical rotations is by end -of-rotation examinations, preceptor evaluations and related methods. Assessment of performance compared to national co horts occurs through the end-of-rotation COMAT exam and the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examinations (COMLEX -USA Levels 1, 2 -CE, 2 -PE* and 3). * NOTE: COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE was suspended indefinitely in February 2021, and formally discontinued in June 2022. COMLEX -USA candidates are currently verified by attestation from their COM dean that they are proficient in these important clinical skills. Additio nal information is available on the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners COMLEX -USA Level 2-PE website . As such, to be eligible to graduate, each student must have successfully completed CUSOM's Clinical Skills Assessment Program, which includes both a longitudinal assessment of student performance and an on-campus multi -station Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE) during the fourth year. This multi - statio n OSCE, also called the Physical Exam - Qualifying Exam (PE -QE), requires students to demonstrate successfully the fundamental clinical skills and physician -related competency domains required for graduation, entrance into supervised graduate medical educati on programs, and the provision of safe osteopathic medical care of patients. In order to successfully complete the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine Program, students must meet all programmatic educational objectives which includes successful demonstration o f the fundamental knowledge, clinical skills, behaviors, attitudes, and physician -related competency domains required for graduation, entrance into supervised graduate medical education programs, and the provision of safe osteopathic medical care of patien ts. 170 6.2.2 Faculty Recusal from Assigning Student Grades Any CUSOM faculty member who is a health care professional with a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship with a CUSOM student, in any CUSOM program, must recuse themselves from all activities involving the summative assessment, grading, and promotion of that student. For the purposes of this policy, a \" therapeutic relationship \" occurs when a licensed clinician assumes the responsibility for the evaluation, diagnosis, or management of a student's medical or behavioral health condition. Recusal Policy If a CUSOM faculty member is a health professional with a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship with a CUSOM student in any CUSOM program, they must recuse themselves as described below. Committee Meetings In the case of committee meetings, including, but not limited to, the Academic Performance, Progress and Standards (APPS) Committee, the committee Chair (or designee) will call for a declaration of any conflict of interest from committee members prior to student case discussions. Any committee member(s) identifying a potential conflict will be required to recuse themselves from both the discussion phase of the meeting as well as the decision -making process for matte rs in which a potential conflict exists. This policy also applies to any faculty member on the Admissions Committee or Endowed and Annua l Scholarship Committee involved in the discussion of an applicant with whom the faculty member has a previous or ongoi ng therapeutic relationship . In such a case, the faculty member must recuse themselves from any discussion or vote regarding the student's candidacy or admission decisions. Summative Skills Assessments In cases of summative skills assessments including, but not limited to, OMM, clinical skills, simulation, and OSCE evaluations, faculty graders with conflicts of interest must recuse themselves from the assessment and grading process. Any faculty member assigned to assess or grade the performance of a current CUSOM student with whom they have a previous or ongoing established therapeutic relationship must identify the conflict of interest to the Course Director. The Course Director will either assign the student assessment and/or grading to a different fa culty member or perform it themselves. 171 If the Course Director also has a potential conflict, then the Block Leader(s) will perform the assessment (or designate another qualified faculty member) and assign the grade. Final Course Grades: Blocks 1 -8 During all first - and second -year courses in preclinical Blocks 1 -8, a Course Director who has a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship with a CUSOM student is prohibited from making any decisions regarding final course grade determinations for that student. In these cases, the Course Director must report the potential conflict of interest to the Block Leader(s) who will then assign the Co -Course Director to make the student's summative assessment or final grade determination. In cases in which ther e is no Co -Course Director, the Block Leader(s) will assume these responsibilities. Activities Not Prohibited by This Policy CUSOM faculty who have previous or ongoing therapeutic relationships with a CUSOM student are permitted to provide student instruction through lectures, small group sessions, clinical skills instruction, or OMM table training. In addition, they may provide academic advising or letters of recommendation at the student's request. Clinical Rotation Evaluations and Grades During third - and fourth -year clinical rotations, supervising faculty preceptors who have an established therapeutic relationship with a current CUSOM student are not permitted to determine the end -of-rotation evaluation for that student. If a preceptor is assigned to supervise such a student for a clinical rotation, they should immediately notify the Regional Dean or Director of Student Medical Education (DSME) in the case of a Clinical Campus without a Regional Dean. The Regional Dean or DSME, in consultation with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, may identify an alternative clinical practice or service for the student's rotation, or in cases when that is not feasible, identify another preceptor on t he ro tation to complete the end -of-rotation evaluation. Policy Implementation Adherence All faculty are notified of this policy and, by signing an acknowledgement, they have read and accept the policies and procedures delineated in the CUSOM Academic Bulletin and Faculty Handbook and are attesting to agreement with abiding by this policy. Each faculty member is expect ed to 172 acknowledge their review of the Faculty Handbook annually . New faculty will acknowledge reviewing the Faculty Handbook u pon signing their contract, and thereafter review on an annual basis as cited previously. A s noted above, this policy will be reviewed at the beginning of any committee meeting regarding student academic performance in which a conflict of interest may exi st. Reminders of the policy are also made at one or more scheduled Faculty and Staff Meetings annually. The CUSOM Professional Development Program also includes disc ussions related to this topic. Assessment of Compliance In compliance with the COCA standards , any health professional with a CUSOM faculty appointment who provides health services to a CUSOM student through a patient relationship must recuse themselves from the academic assessment or promotion of the student receiving those services. A faculty member providing a therapeutic relationship is not responsible for assigni ng grades for medical students. In the pre -clinical curriculum, the Office of Assessment, Accreditation, and Medical Education manages the assessment process and reco rding o f grades in all courses. In the CUSOM model, one of the Course Directors serves as the instructor of record and is responsible for the assigning of grade s for their particular course. In this capacity, the Acting Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs asks each Course Director during every Block if they have a therapeutic relationship with any of the stud ents in their course . If the Course Director identifies any conflicts , then feedback would be provided to the Vice Dean and in that instance a Co -Course Di rector or other designee appointed by the Vice Dean or Dean would be appointed to assign the grades and act as the i nstructor of record. In the clinical curriculum, the appropriate Clinical Chair or the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs ac ts as the inst ructor of record. In a case similar to described above for the situation when a Clinical Chair is asked and determined to be acting in a therapeutic relationship with a student, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs would act as the instructor of record to assign a grade for that student. If a circumstance does arise in which a student identifies a clinical preceptor or faculty member providing summative course grading or skills assessments (including, but not limited to, OMM, clinical skills, simulation, and OSCE ), and with whom they have a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship , they should immediately contact the Course Director (for 1st and 2nd year courses) or Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs (for 3rd or 4th year rotations) . 173 6.2.3 Credits, Grading, and Grade Point Average (GPA) Credit Assignment Process The Office of Academic Affairs is charged with ensuring the appropriateness of credit assignments within the CUSOM curriculum. Corresponding credits are assigned to all courses in the curriculum, including clinical rotations, based on contact hours. Credit assignments are reviewed as described below, and the credit assignments are consistent with the definition of a credit hour as provided in the glossary of the Commission on Colle ge Accreditation (COCA) Accreditation of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine: COM Standards and Procedures . The CUSOM Initial Review Committee (IRC), the CUSOM Curriculum Committee, and the Campbell University Curriculum Council (UCC) have reviewed the credit assignment process and CUSOM curriculum as part of the institutional accreditation process. Campbell University i s accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to award a ssociate, baccalaureate, master , and doctorate degrees. Contact the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges at 1866 Sou thern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033 -4097 or call (404) 679-4500 for questions about the accreditation of Campbell University. Campbell University was awarded Level VI accreditation by the SACSCOC on May 29, 2013, at which time SACSCOC approved the Doctor o f Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree program of CUSOM. The SACSCOC approval reads: \"The Board of Trustees of the Southern Asso ciation of Colleg es and Schools C ommission on Colleg es reviewed the materials seeking approval of the Do ctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree program. It was the decision of the Boa rd to approve the program and include it in the s cope of the current accreditation and to advance the institution to Level VI.\" Campbell University is one of only five private universities in North Carolina to be awarded Level VI accreditation status by SACSCOC. 6.2.3.1 CUSOM C redit Cal culation The CUSOM curriculum utilizes a process by which course grades are determined per Block of study with a designated number of weeks per Block. For the first two years of the curriculum, there are eight Blocks of study ranging from nine (9) weeks to eleven (11) weeks duration. For the third and fourth years, clinical rotations represent four -week (4) Blocks of time. Some clinic al rotations may be divided into shorter time intervals, such as two (2) weeks, as approved by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. 174 CUSOM assigns grades to all credit -bearing courses, and credits for each course are determined based on contact hours ut ilizing 0.5 credit increments. A minimum number of contact hours per credit is delineated, and a course with contact hours not reaching the requirement for the next higher credit value is reported at the next lower credit value. For example, a 1.0 credit course requires 16 contact hours so a course of 10 contact hours would be assigned a value of 0.5 credit, not 1.0 credit. This credit hour calculation is consistent with US Department of Education standards. 6.2.3.2 Credit Review Process CUSOM assigns the amount of credit awarded for student work, and the criteria utilized in this process conform to commonly accepted practices of higher education. CUSOM awards credits to course offerings based on delivery method and duration, utilizing standards endors ed by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admission Officers (AACRAO), as well as the minimum Federal Financial Aid regulations. Review of the curriculum, including credits, is through the CUSOM Curriculum Committee, as well as the Campb ell University Curriculum Council (UCC), as necessary. To ensure appropriateness and consistency, CUSOM reviews credit assignments for the curriculum periodically as part of the curricular design review process. The process includes, but is not limited t o, review of current standards of higher education, precedent established by other Colleges/Schools of Osteopathic Medicine, and consistency with the CUSOM Mission . The records of review of the credit assignment as part of the overall curriculum review are maintained in the Office of Academic Affairs. All proposed curricular changes, including minor and subs tantive changes, are brought to the Initial Review Committee (IRC), and the full Curriculum Committee for review, consideration , discussion and approval. Minor changes include such matters as the addition/elimination of a course, modifications to an exist ing course, or minor changes to existing program requirements. Substantive changes are those that involve extensive new patterns of requirements for existing students, or those that have a significant impact on other programs within the University. For proposed non -substantive curricular changes in years 1 and 2, with minimal impact on other programs or on student requirements, approval is required first through the Block Leaders and Course 175 Directors, in consultation with the Assistant Dean for Curri culum, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Integration, or the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs as necessary, the IRC, and finally by the Curriculum Committee. For proposed non -substantive curricular changes in years 3 and 4, with minimal impact on other programs or on student requirements, approval is required first through the Clinical Department Chairs, in consultation with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Integration, or the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs as necessary , the IRC, and finally by the Curriculum Committee. Upon approval at all levels, the proposed changes are then presented to the Dean for review and final approval. Any proposed substantive changes, as defined by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA), would follow procedures and deadlines as outlined in the COCA Accreditation of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Accreditation Standards and Procedures document: The COCA must be notified of all substantive change requests, which the College of Osteopathic Medicine (COM) wishes to have reviewed at the n ext regularly scheduled me eting. Application must be reviewed by the COCA at a meeting held at least 120 days prior to when the anticipated change would become effective. Application materials must be submitted at least 60 days prior to the COCA meeting where the substantive c hange request will be reviewed. Documentation required for the substantive change submis sion would be submi tted as required. COCA Substantive Change Policies and Procedures effective for reviews submitted on or after August 1, 2021 are found on the COCA website . The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) is the regional body for the accreditation of degree -granting higher education institutions in the Southern states. As such, any proposed CUSOM substantive changes also would be reported to SACSCOC per their requirements and in a timely manner. 6.2.3.3 Grading CUSOM has developed and publicized a grading system, in keeping with the CUSOM Mission , to assess the progress of each student toward meeting programmatic educational objectives and acquiring 176 the competencies essential for effective performance as an osteopathic physician. Throughout all four years of the CUSOM curriculum, students must complete all required coursework and clinical rotations with passing grades as published in this Academic Bulletin. Students who fail any part of the curriculum will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Com mittee for review (See Section 6.7 of this Bulletin ). Additionally, CUSOM maintains longitudinal records marking the career tracks, choices, and achievements of graduates in a comprehensive assessment system. This assessment includes: COMLEX -USA Level 1, licensure; geographi area practice; obtainment and a postgraduate training program; and AOA or ABMS board certification. CUSOM publishes outcomes of student performance in annual reports to the faculty and Board of Trustees. * NOTE: COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE wa s suspended indefinitely in February 2021, and formally discontinued in June 2022. COMLEX -USA candidates are currently verified by attestation from their COM dean that they are proficient in these important clinical skills. Additional information is avail able on the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners COMLEX -USA Level 2-PE website . As such, to be eligible to graduate, each student must have successfully completed CUSOM's Clinical Skills Assessment Program, which includes both a longitudinal assessment of student performance and an on-campus multi -station Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE) during the fourth year. This multi - station OSCE, also called the Physical Exam - Qualifying Exam (PE -QE), requires students to demonstrate successfully the fundamental clinical skills and physician -related competency domains required for gradua tion, entrance into supervised graduate medical education programs, and the provision of safe osteopathic medical care of patients. 177 CUSOM has adopted the following schema for determining letter grades and clinical grades: Grading Scale MS-1 and and MS-4 Rotations Preceptor - Exam Grades Overall Final Grade Quality Points Other Grades A 90-100a 4.0 H-H Hono rs rs 4.0 W Withdraw C 70-79 2.0 HP-HP High Pass 3.5 C*b 70 2.0 H-P High Pass 3.5 F < 70 0.0 HP-P High Pass 3.5 P 70 4.0 P-P Pass Clinical 3.0 P*b 70 2.0 PC*b Pass Clinical 2.0 FC Fail Clinical 0.0 FMP and PCC are P/F P = 4.0 QP F = 0.0 QP P* = 2.0 QP PC = Pass Clinical FC = Fail Clinical a The maximum percentage cannot e xceed 100. Percentage grades are rounded to the tenth from 0.50 upwards, th erefore 82.50-82.99 = 83, while 82.49 = 82. b Denotes course was passed after successful r emediation of an initial failing grade. Incomplete (IC) and Withdr aw (W) do not carry any quality points. 6.2.3.4 Grade Point Average (GPA) , Quality Points A student's grade point average (GPA) is determined by dividing the total number of quality points earned by the total number of graded hours attempted. Note that for purposes of GPA calculations, a grade of \"W\" is not included in \"graded hours attempted\". If a student has earned 227 quality points on 61 graded hours attempted, the grade point average would be 227/61 = 3.721. In the first two years of the CUSOM curriculum, most courses use a traditional letter grade system (A, B, C or F) and are calculated into the GPA. In the third and fou rth years of the CUSOM curriculum, all rotations have a clinical rotation grade as determined through the student's rotation evaluation, and all core rotations have clinical modules and end -of-rotation exam grades. Both the clinical rotation grade and the module portions of the rotation grade use an Honors, High Pass, Pass Clinica l, Fail Clinica l system. Successful completion of the rotation requires students to pass both the clinical rotation (preceptor evaluation) and the end -of-rotation exa m or module portions of the course. Students failing a n end-of-rotation exam have a second opportunity to pass the exam within thirty ( 30) days of notification. 178 If the student fails the second attempt at the post -rotation exam, an F is recorded on the module/exam grade and the student receives an F for the rotation . Students who fail a clinical rotation either due to failure of the post -rotation exam or the preceptor evaluation will be reviewed and acted upon by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. If the APPS Committee grants the student the opportunity to remediate the failed rotation, the entire rotation and post -rotation exam must be repeated in order to successfully remediate the rotation. No course or clinical rotation grade will be changed unless the Office of Academic Affairs or the Office of Clinical Affairs certifies to the Registrar, in writing, an error occurred or remediation results in a grade change. A student may appeal to the Dean for consideration of a grade change only after the APPS Committee has convened and rendered their recommendation. NOTE: \"F\" grades. A student who earned a grade of F initially and is eligible to remediate the course will have the grade reported as Incomplete (IC) on the transcript until the prescribed remediation is attempted and a new grade is issued. The Registrar will report current IC grades to the appropriate Associate Dean at the time the IC is assigned. Once an IC grade has been officially changed to a letter grade on the transcript, the Registrar will not retain a record of IC courses as part of the academic record. Student s who fail to successfully remediate a grade of F will have failed the course and receive an F on the transcript. The highest grade that can be earned for a remediated course is 70%. The new grade, if remediated successfully, will have the letter grade C or P with an asterisk (C* or P*, respectively) associated with the course to reflect a repeated course on the transcript. The grade of C* represents a remediated, passed Graded course, and a P* represents a remediated, passed Pass-Fail course. A success fully remediated clinical rotation will be represented on the transcript as PC*, with the asterisk denoting a remediated clinical rotation . If remediation of a clinical rotation is failed, a grade of FC is assigned. 6.2.3.5 Quality Points Quality points are points assigned to grades in an academic \"banking\" system. CUSOM is on a four -point system. In this system, an \"A\" is worth four (4.0) points per hour, a \"P\" is worth four (4.0) points per hour, a \"B\" is worth three (3.0) points per ho ur, a \"C\" is worth two (2.0) points per hour, a \"C*\" or \"P*\" is worth two (2.0) points per hour, and zero (0) points awarded for \"F\" or failing grades. A student who earns an \"A\" in a three -hour course has 4.0 points per hour x 3 hours = 12 total quality points. Incomplete (IC), and Withdraw (W), do not carry any quality points. 179 6.2.4 Remediation Throughout all four years of the CUSOM curriculum, students must complete all required coursework and clinical rotations with passing grades as published in this Academic Bulletin. Students who fail any part of the curriculum are brought before the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for review and possible disciplinary action. The APPS Committee may offer students who fail any par t of the curriculum an opportunity for remediati on (See Section 6.7) . A student in the first (MS -1) or second (MS -2) year of stud y, who fails any course, will appear before the APPS Committee. If the Committee grants the student the opportunity to remedi ate, the student will receive a grade of Incomplete (IC) until remediation is complete. The student will receive a grade of C* fo r a passed graded course or P* for a passed Pass/Fail course after the successful remediation of the failed course. The C* or P* will remain on the transcript with the notation that the student passed after remediation. A student will earn a grade of F if not allowed remediation or if the student fails the remediation (See Section 6.2.3.4 ). A student in the third (MS -3) or fourth (MS -4) year of stud y who fails a clinical rotation will appear before the APPS Committee. If the Committee grants the student the opportunity to remediate the rotation, the student will receive a grade of Incomplete (IC) until remediation is comple te. The student will receive a PC* after the successful remediation of the failed rotation, and the PC* will appear on the transcript with the notation that the student passed the rotation after remediation. A student will earn a grade of FC if not allow ed remediation or if the student fails the remediatio n (See Section 6.2.3. 4). PLEASE NOTE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMEDIATE IS NOT GUARANTEED AND IS A DECISION MADE BY THE APPS COMMITTEE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. A STUDENT MUST NOT ASSUME THEY WILL BE GRAN TED REMEDIATION. 6.2.5 Eval uation Categories for Years One and Two For the purposes of this Grading Policy, CUSOM recognizes four categories of evaluation modalities, including, but not limited to: 1. Integrated written examinations 2. Laboratory practical examinations 3. Quizzes 4. Other (e.g., SIM performance, Early Clinical Experiences, Projects, Audience Response, individual course exams ) Each category is represented within the CUSOM curriculum. A course grade can be determined by any combination of the components listed above as determined by the Course Director and approved by the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs or Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Integration. 180 Process In an effort to promote faculty flexibility in assigning grades through assessment venues for the four categories identified above , yet also provide consistency across courses, CUSOM recognizes the following approach to testing and grading: Integrated exams typically occur three times in each Block in Years 1 & 2. Foundations of Medical Practice ( FMP), Professional Core Competencies ( PCC), OMM and Clinical Skills course questions are not inclu ded on the integra ted exams except where they are consistent with discip line content in other courses. All other courses may have questions on integrated exams. OMM and Clinical Skills have separate didactic exams, as well as their Pr actical and Lab exams, as required. Quizzes are typically administered each Friday morning of the MS- 1 and MS-2 curriculum. These are integra ted and inclu de questions from lectures given in the sp ecified preceding 3-4 ins truction days. Quizzes may be administered at other times as determined by respective faculty. Course grades are typically determined based on percentage of total points earned out of total points poss ible. Grades are defined by the course-grading plan approved prior to start of the course and delineated in the course syllabi . As su ch, bonus points are not permitted. In rare instance s, there may be exceptions to the establish ed Grading Policy, whi ch require jus tification for deviation from the original plan; however, every attempt is made to ensure the policy stated to the stud ents at the start of the course is the policy by which they will receive th eir course grades. 6.2.6 Clinical Rotations Assessment s 6.2.6 .1 Didactics Students are expected to have a half -day of dedicated didactic experiences per week. This consists of: Cecil's Essentials of Medicine (based on a current schedule provided to the clinical campuses) in a Jeopardy format . 50 Studies Every Internist Should Know - The student will present one assigned landmark case and then present the current information of t hat case. Some students may have to present more than one study per year based on the clinical campus student cohort size. Two (2) case presentations per year based on an interesting case in which they have been involved. 181 COMBANK questions. Students will complete 150 assigned questions relevant to their rotation. If they exhaust those, they can repeat those questions or complete questions from other topics. These are checked for completion. Regional Deans /Director of Student Medical Education (DSME's ) may add topics at their discretion, or at the request of their student cohorts, to enhance the half -day didactic experience. Noon conferences and morning reports are mandatory, if available at the respective clinical campus. Other clinical campus didacti c offerings, such as Tumor Board and medical staff continuing medical education programs, may be mandated by the Regional Dean /DSME . Half-day didactic experiences are led by the third -year student cohort and facilitated by the Regional Dean /DSME . Fourth -year students are expected to attend didactic sessions at the institution in which they are completing a clinical rotation. If they are completing a rotation at a CUSOM clinical campus, they are expected to attend the half -day didactic programming and all other offered didactic experiences. Students are expected to complete all didactic surveys from the web - based evaluation system. This feedback will be used for ongoing improvement and future planning purposes. 6.2.6 .2 Clinical Modules Clinical Modules including videos, lectures , and other educational materials are utilized to supplement knowledge and skill acquisition during clinical rotations and provide students with opportunities for self-directed learning experiences, self -assessment of their learn ing needs, and to further develop skills for lifelong learning. These modules are appropriate for both third - and fourth -year students and offer the learner flexibility. Modules and other educational materials supplement topics covered on clinical rotatio ns and function as study guides for the end -of-rotation exams, COMLEX - USA Level 2 -CE, and the summative OSCE administered by CUSOM. Clinical Modules are an important supplement to a student's education, but do not replace the extensive reading, studying, patient contact, etc. students must achieve on clinical rotations. 182 Students are provided with required curricula during the third - and fourth -year, and syllabi with specific l earning objectives and corresponding reading assignments are provid ed for the core discipline rotation s. Comp letion of learning modu les are due no later than 11:59 pm on the Thursday before the Callb ack Friday of the rotation. In extenuating circumstances, CUSOM Clinical Chairs may grant a limited time extension to complete the modules . Five (5) points will be deducted from the student's COMAT score per day the learning modules remain incomplete. 6.2.6.3 Clinical Exp erience Database (Logs) Each student must maintain a Clinical Experience Database Log in CUSOM's web -based evaluation system so the acquisition of particular clinical skills and exposure to a broad scope of practice for each rotation can be monitored. A minimum of ten (10) proce dures must be documented per rotation (with the exception of independent study electives). If the student did not observe, assist on, or perform any procedures , they are still required to submit a log form stating no procedures were observed, assisted, or performed. Failure to maintain and submit required logs by the deadline will result in a failing grade (Fail Clinical, FC) for the rotation, and referral to the APPS Committee . Completion of procedural logs are due no later than 11:59 pm on the Thursday before the last Friday of the rotation. Students must include all information requested on the log form. In compliance with HIPAA, no patient names or other identifiers may be included on logs. 6.2.7 Grading Rubric for Years Three and Four The primary basis for the core clinical rotation grade is the CUSOM Preceptor Evaluation of Student (PES) Form and the end -of-rotation exam. The end -of- rotation exam is given at the end of the four -week block for select core rotations. The PES Form is completed by the student's clinical faculty preceptor or that clinical campus's respective rotation clerkship director (or designee) following completion of the rotation and should be discussed with the student before submission. For rotations without an end -of-rotati on exam, the student's grade is based solely on the clinical faculty's evaluation (PES) of the student. 1. Some selective and elective four-week rotations may be divided into two (2) dif ferent two-week experiences. In such cases, students will receive a grade as determined by the preceptor for each two-week experience. The overall grade for the four-week rotation will be the combination of the two (2) two-week experience grades. Students who fail either two-week 183 rotation, even if the average of the two rotation evaluations results in a passing grade, will receive an FC for the entire four -week rotation block and will be called to the APPS Committee for r eview. 2. End-of-rotation Examination End-of-rotation exams are administered after the following third - and fourth -year rotations: Medicine II, Surgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Family Medicine, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, and Emergency Medicine. Students must pass the end -of-rotation exam to pass the rotation. Students who do not pass an end -of-rotation exam ar e allowed one chance to retake the exam. If the student passes the exam retake, the highest grade possible is a Pass Clinical (PC*) and they are not eligible for High Pass (HP) or Honors (H) for that clinical rotation. If the end -of-rotation exam is fail ed twice, the student will receive a failing grade for the rotation (Fail Clinical, FC) and be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. If the APPS Committee grants the student the opportunity to remediate the failed rotation, the entire rotation and post -rotation exam must be repeated in order to successfully remediate the rotation . If the student passes the remediation, a grade of PC* is assigned. If remediation is failed, a grade of FC is assigned. 3. Completion of Learning Modules on Clinical Rotation Several core clinical rot ations, including Pediatrics, Medicin e I and II , Family Medicin e, General Surgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology, and Psychiatry utilize eviden ce-based, medi cal education online modu les, selected by the respective CUSOM Clinical Chairs, to suppl ement learning and skill acquisition. In addition to provid ing a unified, comparable curriculum and educational learning objectives across core clinical education sites, these learning modules provide student s with opportunities for self -directed learning experiences, self -assessment of their learning needs, and to further develop skills for lifelong learning . Students are required to complete all assigned learning modules as described in the clinical rotation syllabi in order to pass the rotation and advance to the next clinical rotation . Monitoring of student progress and verification of learning module completion, including the required level of engagement, is provided by the r espective CUSOM Clinical Chairs. Completion of learning modules are due no later than 11:59 pm on the Thursday before the Call back Friday of the rotation. In extenuating circumstances, CUSOM Clinical Chairs may grant a limited time extension to complete the modules. Five (5) points will be deducted from the student's COMAT score per day the learning modules remain incomplete . 184 4. Preceptor Evaluation of the Student (PES) and Student Evaluation of the Preceptor (SEP) All evaluations must be completed and submitted to the Office of Clinical Affairs within seven (7) days of completion of each rotation. Competency -based rating forms with Entrustable Professional Activity (EPA) behavioral anchors are used by preceptors to evaluate each student's clinical skills and the application of medical knowledge in the clinical setting. A student failing a clinical rotation will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Stand ards (APPS) Committee. Students failing a rotation may be required to repeat the failed rotation and be placed on a Modified Course of Study, which may delay the student's date of graduation. The CUSOM compet ency-based evaluation is based on the following core compet encies in each area: Osteopathic Philosop hy and Osteopathic Manipulative edicine Medical Patient Care Interpersonal and Comm unication Skills Professionalism Practice-Based Learning and Improv ement System s-Based Practice Courses of eight (8) weeks duration (example: Internal Medicine) require an evaluation to be completed at the end of each four -week block. If a student has an approved rotation of two (2) weeks duration, the evaluation is to be completed at the end of the two-week period. If a student does not receive a passing grade on the end -of-rotation evaluation from the preceptor, the student will fail the rotation and receive an FC grade on their transcript. Rotation grades for students who are permitted to split a four (4) week selective or elective rotation into two different two -week experiences will be the combination of the two , 2-week experience grades. Students who fail either two -week rotation, even if the average of the two rotation evaluations results in a passing grade, will receive an FC for the entire four -week rotation block and will be called to the APPS Committee for review. One rotation evaluation form will be submitted and accepted per each 2 (two) or 4 (four) week rotation. If a stude nt worked with more than one clinical faculty member during the rotation, it is expected the clinical faculty member completing the rotation will complete a composite evaluation as designated on the evaluation form and seek feedback of the other teaching clinical faculty to include in the overall evaluation. 185 In order to receive a grade for each rotation, the student must ensure each of the following are completed and received by the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs: 1. Preceptor Evaluation of Student (PES) Form, 2. Student Evaluation of Site (SES) Form 3. Student Evaluation of Preceptor (SEP) Form 4. End-of-rotation examination 5. Rotation learning modu les 6. Clinical experience database (logs) Failure to comp lete any rotation requirement or submit any required rotation do cument ation will result in a failing grade (Fail Clinical, FC) and referral to the AP PS Committee. Items wh ich may also be used to det ermine grades on clinical rotations include but are not limited to : 1. Educational modules - Lectures, cases, reading assignments and other fo rms of d elivery that may be utiliz ed in the third- and fourth - year curriculum. 2. Students Logs (Procedure Logs) - Students must submit rot ation clinical patient logs and proc edure logs. 3. Question Bank Review - Students are required to compl ete 150 COMBA NK qu estions during each clinical rot ation in order to receive credit for the rot ation. 4. Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine - Compl etion of OMM spe cial assignments and p articipation in OMM skills lab during C allback Fridays for core rot ations are required. 5. Objective Structured Clinical Performance Examination (OSCE) and Standardized Patient (SP) Exercises - OSCE and SP exercises demonstrate the student's ability to perform clinical skills and to evaluate patient pre sentations for the most common disorders found in adult and pediatric patients. During the first two years of the CUSOM curriculum, students complete a minimum of eighteen (18) standardized, timed OSCE encounters (nine (9) as MS -1, nine (9) as MS -2). Ten (10) of these OSCEs are summative; the students must achieve a minimum score of 70% on both the Biomedical/Biomechanical and Humanistic Domains to successfully pass the Clinical Skills course and advance in the curriculum. These OSCEs include taking a me dical history, evaluating signs and symptoms to formulate a differential diagnosis, performing a physical examination, assessing the results of diagnostic exams to evaluate and narrow a differential diagnosis, demonstrating the ability to manage common med ical scenarios, and providing 186 appropriate documentation of the patient encounter in the form of a SOAP note. OSCE, Simulation, and Clinical Skills may also be incorporated into Call back Fridays. During the Residency Development course, the first rotation of the fourth year of the CUSOM curriculum, CUSOM students must successfully complete an on -campus summative four -station OSCE (the PE QE) which requires students to successfully demonstrate the fundamental clinical skills and physician -related competency domains required for graduation, entrance into supervised graduate medical education programs, and the provision of safe osteop athic medical care of patients. 6.2.7 .1 Preceptor Eval uation of Student Performance A clinical faculty preceptor or a clinical campus's respective rotation clerkship director (or designee) will evaluate a student's performance during the respective rotation. The Preceptor Evaluation of Student (PES) Form will be completed by supervising physicians with input from appropriate hospital staff with direct knowledge of the student's performance. During the last week of each rotation, the student must meet with the preceptor to review their performance and end of rotation evaluation. Based on the grading rubric, a grade of Honors, High Pass, Pass, or Fail Clinical for the PES will be submitted to the Registrar's Office. Students will have access to the electronic PES via the CUSOM web-based evaluation system . Completed PES Forms are due in the Office of Clinical Affairs within seven (7) calendar days of completion of each rotation. If the student worked with more than one clinical faculty member, the student should have the principal evaluator or the clinical campus's respective rotation clerkship director (or designee) submit a composite evaluation based on the input of those physicians with whom the student worked. One rotation PES Form will be submitted and accepted per two ( 2) or four (4) week rotation. Students a re not permitted to solicit additional evaluations. PES Forms must be completed by the primary evaluator who must be an attending physician. While resident physicians may provide input to aid the attending physician in completing the evaluation, residents are not permitted to serve as the primary evaluator. Students are not permitted to self -comp lete the evaluation and submit to the evaluator for a signature. Violation of this rule or falsification of any component of the PES Form will be considered an Honor Code violation. 187 Violation of this policy will be subject to review by the APPS Committee and may result in a rotation failure or Incomplete (IC) grade. Any Incomplete (IC) grade will jeopardize student eligibility for financial aid and may also alter/delay their graduation date. It is the student's responsibility to ensure all PES Form s are either completed online or submitted to the Clinical Affairs Office within seven (7) calendar days of completion of each rotation. It is the student's responsibility to expediently inform the Office of Clinical Affairs of any difficulty in obtaining an ev aluation from the preceptor at the end of the rotation. Only one PES Form from the clinical faculty preceptor (preceptor of record), primary evaluator, or rotation clerkship director (or designee) will be accepted. It is expected each student will meet with the preceptor assigning the grade at the end of the rotation to review comments and to reconcile any issues, including concerns related to factual or typographical errors in the evaluation, at that time. If a stu dent does not do so, or if the student meets with the preceptor but does not bring forward any concerns at that time, the preceptor comments from the appropriate section of the evaluation will stand and will be included verbatim on the student's MSPE . There will be no exceptions to this policy and no option to appeal for a change in the preceptor evaluation at a later date. All submitted PES Forms are final. However, if a student has met with the preceptor as required above, the student may submit a grievance related to any unresolved factual or typographical error (See Section 6.10.2) to the Third - or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator, as appropriate . Any factual or typographical errors in a preceptor evaluation may be edited only if approved by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs will review any requested changes of factual or typographical errors and make the determination to approve or deny the requested change(s). 6.2.7 .2 Composite Evaluations As mentioned in other sections of this bulletin, if a student worked with more than one clinical faculty member during the rotation, it is expected the clinical faculty member will complete a composite evaluation as designated on the PES Form . In this situation, the student should have the principal eva luator or the clinical campus's respective rotation clerkship director (or designee) complete and submit the composite evaluation. 188 If such a composite evaluation is completed, it is expected the author of the evaluation form will consult with other clinica l faculty, nursing staff, and members of the healthcare team who interacted with the student during the clinical rotation to provide accurate and constructive feedback of the student's overall rotation performance. Only one PES Form from the rotation clerkship director (or designee) will be accepted. Students are not permitted to solicit additional evaluation forms from other clinical faculty on the rotation into the final evaluation form. Students who solicit additional evaluations may be brought be fore the APPS Committee. It is expected each student will meet with the preceptor assigning the grade at the end of the rotation to review comments and to reconcile any issues, including concerns related to factual or typographical errors in the evaluatio n, at that time. If a student does not do so, or if the student meets with the preceptor but does not bring forward any concerns at that time, the preceptor comments from the appropriate section of the evaluation will stand and will be included verbatim on the student's MSPE . There will be no exceptions to this policy and no option to appeal for a change in the preceptor evaluation at a later date. The overall responsibility to ensure evaluations have been completed and returned to the Office of Clinical Affairs (or clinical campus student medical education coordinator if indicated) remains with the student. For this reason, students are responsible for setting up a time to review their final evaluation with their preceptor during the last week of the ro tation to discuss their overall performance and obtain their preceptor signature on the evaluation. While the summative PES Form must be completed and submitted at the end of the rotation, students are to regularly, including at the end of every week of each clinical rotation, request feedback from the preceptor, (e.g., \"How am I doing?\", \"Are there things I should improve?\") in ord er to continually address areas needing improvement. This provides students an opportunity to improve any deficient areas while on the rotation and prevents an unexpected poor evaluation at the end of the rotation. It is the student's responsibility to s eek ongoing feedback from their preceptor. Students should check with the Office of Clinical Affairs (or site coordinators if directed) regularly to their completed preceptor evaluation has been received . Clinical Affairs staff may assist the student in obtaining an evaluation if a preceptor fails to complete the evaluation form or to turn it in to the Office of Clinical Affairs or clinical campus student medical education coordinator in the required timeframe. 189 Preceptor com ments from the appropriate sect ion of the PES Form will be included on the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). 6.2.7 .3 Delinquent Evaluations During the second week of the rotation, the CUSOM Third - or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator will enter the student preceptor information provided by the clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator into CUSOM's web-based evaluation system. It is CUSOM's expectation the Clinical Faculty preceptor will complete the PES Form at the end of the final week of the rotation and review it with the student to provide constructive feedback. Obtaining a PES Form in a timely fashion is critical to ensure an up - to-date and accurate student academic record and transcript. At the end of the first week following a Clinical Rotation, the CUSOM Third - or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator will run a report in CUSOM 's web -based evaluation system to identify any incomplete PES Forms . These findings are reported to the corresponding student, clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator , and Regional Dean /DSME . The Regional Dean /DSME directly contacts the Clinical Faculty preceptor to remind him/her of the pending PES Form . At the end of the second week following a Clinical Rotation, the CUSOM Third - or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator will run another repor t in CUSOM's web -based evaluation system to identify any remaining incomplete PES Form s. These are communicated to the corresponding student, clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator, Regional Dean /DSME , and Associate Dean for Clinical Affair s. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, in collaboration with the Regional Dean /DSME , directly contacts the Clinical Faculty preceptor to obtain the pending PES Forms . If the PES Form is not completed by the third week following a Clinical Rotation, the Regional Dean /DSME or a designee completes the student's evaluation. 190 6.2.7 .4 Rotations, Course Remediation , and Academic Probation Failure of a clinical rotation occurs if the student fails either the preceptor evaluation of the student or the end -of-rotation exam after a second attempt. Failure of a clinical rotation (grade of Fail Clinical, FC) for either reason will result in a re ferral to the APPS Committee for review. If the student is permitted to remediate, they will be required to repeat the entire rotation, including any associated modules and end - of-rotation exam, and may be placed on Academic Probation. Mandatory repeatin g of a clinical rotation will result in the institution of a Modified Course of Study, which may result in a delay in the student's graduation date and may adversely affect financial aid and the student's ability to participate in the residency match process . The student may incur additional tuition costs and fees such as re-taking the end -of-rotation exam. Additionally, the student will be responsible for reimbursing CUSOM for any rotation/preceptor costs associated with repeating any failed rotatio ns, including, but not limited to, housing costs if a student is displaced from their clinical campus in order to remediate the failed rotation . These charges will be billed directly to the student's account. Failure of a second clinical rotation is evid ence the student is unprepared for the rigors of clinical practice and may result in dismissal from the program. Students who fail a clinical rotation for any reason will come before the APPS Committee. In addition, repeated performance evaluations in wh ich items performed in a specific category or across categories are rated as \"1\" or \"2\", even if the student achieves a passing rotation grade, will be reason for remediation at the discretion of the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs in consultation with the Clinical Chair, the clinical faculty preceptor, or the APPS Committee. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs will investigate any evaluation rating of \"2\" or less on any competency regardless of an overall passing grade. The findings of this investigation may lead to a follow -up student meeting with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, Regional Dean /DSME , or Clinical Chair, or result in referral to the APPS Committee. 191 Students are expected to show a progression of improvement in performance during the course of clinical rotations. Students who fail to perform satisfactorily on clinical rotations as described above, will be referred to the APPS Committee and may result in additional required curriculum, repeat ing of an entire academic year, or dismissal from the program. Poor ratings or preceptor comments on th e Preceptor Evaluation of Student (PES) Form in the professional and ethical areas of the assessment of a student are addressed by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and may result in a remediation appropriate to correct the deficient area. Poor rati ngs related to professional and ethical behavior area must be accompanied by preceptor comments as to the exact nature of the rating. The Associate Dean of Clinical Affairs may refer the student for an APPS Committee hearing which will act upon this refer ral depending on the severity and the ar ea of the performance measure. 6.2.8 Grading Policies Years 3 and 4 Failur es: A failing grade on a clinical rotation, due to either failure of an end- of-rotation examination or a failing preceptor evaluation, will be recorded as a Fail Clinical (FC) on the stude nt's official transcript. In addition, f ailure to complete any rotation requirement or submit any required rotation documentation may result in a failing grade (Fail Clinical, FC). A student failing a clinical rotation will be referred to the APPS Committe e and if given the opportunity to remediate, will be required to repeat the clinical rotation, and may be placed into a Modi fied Course of Study which may result in delaying graduation. Addition al consequences may apply to students who have failed a rotation as noted in Section 6.7 of this Bulletin. After satisfactory completion of a remediation of a failed rotation, a Pass Clinical (PC*) will be entered as the final grade for the rotation. Placement of a student on Academic Probation is mandatory if the student has failed a clinical rotation while on Academic Warning, or failed multiple courses or clinical rotations . Students who fail two or more rotations may be dismi ssed from CUS OM. Additional information regarding failure of clinical rotations and Modi fied Courses of Study may be found in Section 6.6.3 of this Bulletin. 192 Incomplete Grades: If, for any reason, a student receives an incompl ete evaluation or is unable to compl ete a rotation or its associ ated requirements, the student will receive an Incomplete (IC) for the rotation. Students are required to make up any incompl ete requirements as coordinated and approved by the Associate Dean for Clinic al Affairs. Failure to make up the requirements may constitute a failure to make academic progress, result in a rotation failure ( Fail Clinical; FC), and may be referred to the APPS Committe e. In addition, failure to meet all third - year rotation requirements will result in an inabil ity for the student to be promoted to fourth -year clinical rotations. Rotations with Family Members: While many CUSOM students have relatives who are physicians and may have been inspired by those family members to pursue osteopathic medicine, students may not complete rotations with a family member as the clinical faculty preceptor of record. This includes family members related by marriage or in -laws. Unauthoriz ed Rotations: Any student starting an Elective or Selective rotation without prior pr oper registration (according to the process described elsewhere in this Bulletin) with the Office of Clinical Affairs will not receive credit for that rotation, and all such violations are subject to review by the APPS Committe e. Students must follow the prescribed process for obtaining pre-approval for all Elective and Selective rotations to ensure all required documentation and proper affiliation agreeme nts are in place. For questions regar ding the approval process, students should contact the Student Medical Education Clinical Coordi nators for Third - Year or Fourth -Year . 6.3 Educational Records 6.3.1 Policy Statement on Student Information and Educational Records For general information related to FERPA see Section 1.1 of this Bulletin. Also, Campbell University guarantees each student certain rights in compliance with FERPA. Please refer to Campbell University's Annual Notification of Rights Under FERPA . CUSOM has a secure, confidential, onsite computerized record system with an offsite secure network backup. All items entered into this system are retained as a part of a student's permanent record. A student's permanent record contains the transcript from CUSOM, transcripts and transcript evaluations from other educational agen cies attended by the student, secondary school transcripts, Standardized test scores, the student's application for admission, general correspondence with the student, and if applicable, letters or other documentation concerning misconduct. 193 Upon appointment with the Registrar, a student may examine their transcript and contents of their permanent record. University officials with access to a student's educational records are the President, Provost, Academic Deans, Registrar, Office of Studen t Affairs , and designees of these University officials with a legitimate educational interest in the record. There is a health and safety emergency exception to FERPA which states the institution may disclose personally identifiable information from an ed ucation record to appropriate parties including parents in connection with an emergency if knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health and safety of the student or other individuals. More information can be found at the U.S. Department of Education Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) website . All documents and other information concerning student academic records, student disciplin ary i ssues, including written reprimands, are securely maintained in a confidential file. Such actions become a part of a student's permanent education record. All disciplinary actions, with the exception of admonitions , academic warnings , and conduct warning s, are required to be reported on the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE) as well as any State Medical Education Verification forms. 6.3.2 Match -State Medical Education Verification Once a stud ent participates in the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP ) or the S an Francisco , Urology and/or Military Match and is placed in a residency training program , several forms must be completed and processed for licensing purposes in the state the student will be doing their residency training . State M edical Education Verification forms vary from state to state. Most verifications have very specific information requested and CUSOM must provide complete and thorough answer s. CUSOM will be requested to complete and file another medical school education verification form throughout the alumni's lifetime with any program or residence move. 6.4 Attendance 6.4.1 Attendance Policy Years 1 and 2 Attendance an d active participation in lectures, cases, and labs during first - and second -year provides students the opportunity to engage with their professors and fellow students, to participate in active learning exercises, and ask questions to clarify difficult concepts. Students will establish and grow meaningful relationships with fellow students and the broa der CUSOM community, and foster a deeper level of inquiry, understanding and application of fundamental concepts to the practice of medicine and patient care. 194 During years 1 and 2, students are encouraged to attend all lectures. Faculty will schedule form al office hours during Study Times on the schedule, not scheduled class/lab time, to avoid conflicts with in -person class participation. Attendance is required at all labs and other designated scheduled curricular activities including, but not limited to, Interprofessional Education (IPE) events and Grand Rounds. Absences from mandatory sessions for emergencies during years one and two are considered on a case -by-case basis through the Department of Medical Education in consultation with the Course Direct or as delineated in Section 6.4.2 of this Bulletin . Years 3 and 4 Attendance of third - and fourth -year students is required for all requisite clinical duties of the clinical rotation . Any time away from a clinical rotation must be approved through the process described in Section 6.4.3 of this Bulletin . Students on clinical rotations are required to be on time for all assigned activities associated with each rotation which may include, but are not limited to, lectures, rounds, hospital comm ittee meetings, on -call assignments, case presentations, etc . St udents must abide by attendance requirements as described in Section 6.4.3 of this Bulletin . Non-adherence to the Attendance Policy Any falsification of attendance records or other attempt to circumvent processes is considered an Honor Code violation. Failure to meet attendance requirements may result in referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for review, corrective action, and additional sanctions as described in Section 6.7 of this Bulletin. Sanctions the APPS Committee may impose include, but are not limited to, removal from any leadership position with a student club, organization or student government office, issuance of a Conduct Warning, placeme nt on Conduct Probation, or other sanctions as delineated in Section 6.7 of this Bulletin. 6.4.2 MS-1 and MS-2 Years During years one and two, attendance is required for the following: All laboratory sessions (Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine, Clinical Skills, Simulation, and Anatomy). Designated scheduled curricular activities including, but not limited to, Interprofessional Education (IPE) events and Grand Rounds. All assessments as listed on the Block schedules. Integrated Exams are in-person excep t in unusual circumstances. 195 Absences from Required Lectures , Laboratory, Clinical Skills, and Interprofessional Education (IPE) Activities It is recognized there may be instances when a student must be absent; however, a student who misses a required lecture, laboratory or workshop is not excused from the subject materials or activities of th e particular session(s). The student may be required to make -up the missed educational session(s) during off -hours. Make -up laboratories are conducted only in ex treme situations and at the discretion of the Course Director in consultation with Med Ed, and Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs when necessary. Med Ed will notify the Course Director of the decision if approved. Approval must be granted and obtained in order to arrange a mak e-up with the Course Director. An unexcused absence from any of these mandatory activities may result in a grade of zero (0) or an overall grade deduction (as indicated in each specific course syllabus) which may lead to an overa ll failing course grade. A student may be eligible to request an excused absence from a required session through Med Ed by meeting one of the following qualifying criteria: Medical Illness : For a me dical co ndition/illness, the student must provide Med Ed with a note fr om the exa mining physician or other appropriate healthcare provider (who is NOT a f amily member) indicating the medical visit, the amount of recommended time -off, a nd the student's return-to-class da te. Personal Leave : For personal leave, unless it is emergent in nature, the absence request must be submitt ed at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the anticipated absence. Personal leave does not include vacations, weddings, graduations or other similar activities or events. Examples of appropriate requests for personal leave include: o Death in immediate family o Critical status secondary to accident/acute illness involvi ng an immediate family member Note: \"Immediate member\" is defined as a student's parent, stepparent , grandparent, spouse, spous e's parent, child, or siblin g. Jury Duty : It is the obligation of every citizen to serve on jury duty when called. If a CUSOM student is called to serve on a jury, or if a CUSOM student is ordered to appear in court as a witness, the student should submit the appropriate lecture or lab excused absence request as outlined above and advise the Associate Dean for Biomedic al Affairs as soon as possible. o For Jury Duty, the absence request and supporting documentation must be submitted to Med Ed at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the anticipated absence. 196 National Meetings or CUSOM -related Activities : For attending CUSOM -related activities or national meetings of student clubs and organizations, an excused absence request must be submitted, in writing, to Med Ed at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the anticipated absence(s). o To be considered for s uch a request, students must have a cumulative GPA 3.0 on a 4.0 scale, no prior course failures, and be in good academic and professional standing (not on academic or conduct warning or probation). o Students are allowed a maximum of two (2) excused absenc es per semester for volu ntary attendance at conferences. o No travel arrangements should be made prior to approval being granted by Med Ed. CUSOM accepts no responsibility or liability for any losses as a consequence of any cancelled or delayed travel plans due to a student's failure to obtain prior approval . Religious Holidays : Students may request an excused absence for religious holidays not included in the list of recognized University holidays. The submission of an excused request for this purpose do es not guarantee approval will be granted. Appropriate documentation to support any excused absence request is required, and must be submitted for approval to Med Ed. Absences from an Assessment In the event of any absence from an assessment including, examinations, quizzes, and OSCEs, approval (based upon the qualifying criteria detailed above) must be obtained from Med Ed to arrange a make -up. It is essential students make every effort not to miss any assessment . Requests for make - up assessments must be made in a timely manner with Med Ed. An unexcused absence from assessment may result in a grade of zero (0) for that assessment which may lead to an overall failing course grade. If a student receives an excused absence for any assessment, the studen t will be required to make -up the assessment as soon as possible at a time and date to be determined by Med Ed and approved by the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs as necessary. Patterns of absences from assessments may result in the student having t o appear before the APPS Committee. Evaluation and Approval of an Excused Absence Request For an absence to be considered excused, students must notify Med Ed and complete the appropriate lecture or lab \"Excused Absence Request Form\" online. Med Ed will determine if the excused absence is approved or denied, and the student will be notified of th e decision in a timely manner. 197 If a student is failing any course or has been placed on Academic Probation, they may not be approved for an excused absence unles s for an extenuating situation determined on a case -by-case basis. The Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs will resolve any disagreement concerning an attendance decision. Once an absence request is approved, it is the student's responsibility to contact the Course Director (s) and Med Ed to arrange a makeup for missed laboratories or an assessment where applicable . o It is important to note that, although Course Directors will do their best to accommodate makeup requests, some missed experiences may not be able to be replicated, and the arrangement is at the Course Directors' discretion. o In the case in which a missed experience is not able to be replicated, and therefore unable to be made up, the student may receive a zero (0) for that assessment, wh ich may lead to an overall failing course grade. Official Holidays CUSOM o bserves the following Univ ersity holidays. New Year's Day Martin Luther King , Jr. Day Good Friday Memorial Day Juneteenth Independence Day Labor D ay Thanksgiving Christmas Holidays falling on a weekend will be observed either on the Friday before or the Monday after the holiday, or as designated by Campbell University. A list of Campbell University recognized holidays for the current calendar year is found on the University's Human Resources website . Clinical rotations a re independent of this schedule and follow the approach delineated in Section 6.4.3.7 of this Bulletin. 6.4.2.1 Cons equences of Non-compliance of Attendance Policies As professionals, students are expected to strictly adhere to the attendance policy. Non-compliance with the Attendance Policy by MS -1 and MS -2 students is considered a violation of CUSOM professionalism policy and may result in referral to the APPS Committee for disciplinary action up to and including suspension or dismissal from the prog ram. 198 6.4.3 MS-3 and MS -4 Years ( Clinical Rotations ) 6.4.3 .1 Reporting for Service On the first day of each clinical rotation, the student should report to the clinical faculty preceptor or their representative by no later than 8:00 am or at the time required. Any questions regarding specific instructions for reporting on the first day of rotations should be directed to the regional site Student Medical Education Coordinator or the CUSOM Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator for Third - or Fou rth-Year, as appropriate. Students are expected to bring their own basic diagnostic equipment (i.e., otoscope, ophthalmoscope, stethoscope, etc.). Timeliness is a critical component of professionalism and demonstrates respect to clinical preceptors, office/hospital staff, fellow students, and patients. As such, s tudents are expected to arrive at least fifteen (15) minutes early for each of their scheduled workdays . Tardiness reflect s negatively on both the student and CUSOM and will not be accepted . 6.4.3 .2 Work Ho urs Each rotation consists of approximately 160 contact hours inclusive of modules, self -directed learning, didactics, and other duties as assigned by the site. Students are required to be at their assigned supervised clinical education during all working hours , although exceptions may be granted as described below (see Section 6.4.3 .4) as indicated and determined by the training site and the physician in charge of that service, in cooperation with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and the Vice -President of Medical Education/Regional Dean/ Director of Student Medical Education (DSME ) of the CUSOM clinical campus . The specific days and times a student is expected to report is determined by the preceptor, and students may be assigned to day, evening, night, weekend, or holiday work hours. Preceptors may ask students to rotate with them during their scheduled wor k hours in order for the student to gain the most clinical experience during times of peak patient flow . The Campbell University holiday schedule is independent of the clinical rotation schedule . Third - and fourth -year students must follow the schedule a s outlined by their preceptor for the clinical rotation . 199 6.4.3 .3 Training H ours Clear communication of the expectations between students, the Office of Clinical Affairs, and the training sites will permit flexibility within reasonable limits in a way which does not impact either clinical education or reflect poorly on a student's professionalism. Four (4) weeks of vacation time is included in both the third - and fourth -year as a scheduled rotation block. The exact number of days or length (hours) of required shift schedules are determined by the preceptor and may be different depending on the specific specialty , clinical site , and consistent with meeting the educational outcomes of the rotation . General su rgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Hospitalist, sub -internship, and Emergency Medicine rotations frequently involve shifts outside normal weekday daytime working hours. Working hours in each of the services will be indicated and determined by the training site and the physician in charge of the particular service, in cooperation with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and the Vice -President of Medical Education/Regional Dean/ Director of Student Medical Education (DSME ) of the CUSOM clinical campus . If ca ll, night duty, or weekend duties are required, this will be indicated by the individual rotation. Students may not substitute workday hours from one service for anoth er and are required to remain on the clinical rotation to which they are assigned. A student may spend time in another department only if it is part of the assigned clinical rotation's curriculum and only with approval of their attending physician/clerkship director. For example, it is acceptable for a student in general sur gery to spend time in pathology seeking tissue and biopsy results to ensure proper follow -up and continuity of care. It is not acceptable, however, for a student to make -up missed hours of an Obstetrics/Gynecology rotation in the Emergency Department. Any questions regarding these training hour requirements should be directed to the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Students are not permitted to rearrange their normal working schedule to allow for time off during any rotation. The only exception may be the Emergency Medicine and inpatient Hospitalist rotations in order to accommodate shift schedules, provided it has been approved by the appropriate supervising physician. 200 Professionalism in patient care requires reliable attendance. The Office of Cli nical Affairs will centrally track the number of days off for each student. No unexcused absences are permitted from patient care activities. As noted below, students will be given a total of three (3) discretionary days and five (5) sick days (approved absences) per academic year. Any student in violation of attendance policies will be referred to the APPS Committee for further review. All s tudent absence requests must be made utilizing the o fficial CUSOM Absence Request/ Submission form which may be obtained from the Office of Clinical Affairs or found on CUSOM's web-based evaluation system. All absences, whether a current illness or a request for a future absence, must be completed usi ng this form. 6.4.3. 4 Clinical Rotation Attendance Attendance at all scheduled workdays is mandatory. Students are expected to arrive at least fifteen (15) minutes early for each of their scheduled workdays. Any length of absence (an hour, half day, full day, etc.) must be immediately reported to the preceptor, clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator, Regional Dean / Director of Student Medical Education (DSME) and the corresponding Third - or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUS OM Office of Clinical Affairs. All r equests for planned absences must be submitted electronically via the CUSOM Absence Request/Submission Form (as identified below) to the corresponding Third - or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator. Extracurricular activities, vacations, or lack of childcare are NOT acceptable excuses for absences. 1. Discretionary Days Students are allowed three (3) discretionary days total annually. No more than one (1) day may be taken in any given clinical rotation, and discretionary days may NOT be used on a Callback Friday. 201 Discretionary days MUST be approved by both the preceptor and Office of Clinical Affairs in writing at least one (1) week in advance to the requested t ime off. Requests for discretionary days off are to be submi tted electroni cally via the CUSOM Absence Request/Submission Form to the correspondi ng Third- or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator . 2. Sick D ays Students are allowed five (5) sick d ays annually. If more than five (5) sick d ays total are taken in a single academic year by a student, which prevents them from meeting the requirements of one or more rotations, the student may be referred to the Office of Clinical Affairs or the AP PS Com mittee for review. If a student must miss any clinical time due to illness (l eaving early, arriving late, or missing a full day), they must immediately notify their preceptor, clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator, Regional Dean /DSME and the corresponding Third - or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs . If 2-4 hours of clinical time are missed, a half day leave will be documented. More than four (4) hours of missed clinical time equals a full d ay of sick le ave. If the student is absent from a single rotation for two (2) days or more due to illness , the student is required to submit a note f rom a licensed healthcare provid er to the Office of Clinical Affairs defining the number of days absent and the expected d ate of return. A student may be required to make up missed days in order to meet the educational outcomes of the rotation . If circumstances require a prolonged absence (more than three (3) days in one rotation), the student may be encouraged to consider a Medical Leave of Absence whi ch can be requested through the Office of Clinical Affairs in conjunction with the Office of Student Affairs . A Medical Leave of Absence may be required for students who miss more than three (3) days due to medi cal reasons and are unable to make up the missed time prior to the end of the rotation. A M edical Leave of Absence may result in the student being placed on a Modified Course of Study and a delay the student's graduation. Each case is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 202 Students who require a Medical Leave of Absence must follow the process described in Section 6.8 of the Academic Bulletin \"Separation from the Program\", specifically Section 6.8.2.3, \"Medical Leave of Absence - Absence less than 180 Calendar Days\". 3. Family Emergencies / D eath in Family Due to the variability of circumstances, time-off requested for family emergencies or a death in the family will be reviewed by the Office of Clinical Affairs on a case-by-case basis. Students reques ting time off for immediate family emergencies or a death in the immediate family may be eligible to request a Personal Leave of Absence as described in Section 6.8 .2.2 of the Academic Bulletin. Note: \"Immediate family member\" is defined as a student's parent, stepparent , grandparent, spouse, spous e's parent, child or siblin g. Students taking a Leave of Absence may have to be placed on a Modified Course of Study which could result in a delay in the student's graduation. 4. Time off for Residency Interviews Students may request no more than four (4) days off for interviews during any four -week rotation, and no more than two (2) days over any two -week rotation . This includes partial day absences of greater than four (4) hours. A student may be required to ma ke up missed days in order to meet the educational outcomes of the rotation. All requests for time -off must include written verification of the interview location and date and be provided to the Office of Clinical Affairs at least one (1) week prior to th e requested date of absence. As noted previously, permission for time off for internship/residency interviews must be granted in advance with the aforementioned offices. 5. Conferences Additional excused time off for conference attendance may be granted only if the student is presenting, is a national officer, or by special permission. All requests for conferences require prior approval by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs as noted above. A student may be required to make up missed days in order to meet the educational outcomes of the rotation . 203 Educational presentations, such as posters or research, may be considered toward meeting the required contact hours for the rotation at the discretion of the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Only students in good academic and professional standing and with an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale at the end of the MS -2 year will be considered. In addition, for students to be considered for an absence to attend a conference, th ey must have up -to-date submissions of all clinical rotation evaluations, site evaluations, and clin ical experience database logs. Extracurricular activities, vacations, or lack of childcare are NOT acceptable excuses for absences. Email is the primary method of communication between the Department of Clinical Affairs and students, and, thus, students must check their CUSOM email regularly. Student Absence Request Requirements All s tudent absence reque sts must be made utilizi ng the official CUSOM Absence Request / Submission form which may be obtain ed from the Office of Clinical Affairs or found on CUSOM's web -based evaluation system. All absences, whether a current illness or a request for a future absence, must be completed using this form. There are no exceptions to this procedure and failure to follow the procedure will result in the student being assigned an unexcused absence . Failure to Provide Notification of an Absence Failure to notify the clinical site/preceptor, clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator, Regional Dean /DSME and the corresponding Third - or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs of any absence from a rotation, regardless of the r eason or number of hours absent, may result in h referral to the APPS Committee for failure to follow CUSOM policy and violation of CUSOM professionalism standards . 204 6.4.3 .5 Make-Up Time Students must be available to make up anticipated time off at the discretion of the rotation preceptor in order to maintain compliance with the CUSOM attendance policy. If a student's excused absence results in missing an examination, the student will ret ake the exam under the direction of the Office of Clinical Affairs . Students who miss more than a total of four (4) days of a four -week rotation, or two (2) days of a two -week rotation, regardless of the reason, and who are unable to make up the missed ti me prior to the end of the rotation will not receive credit for the rotation and will be required to appear before the APPS Committee. Failure to notify the clinical site/preceptor, clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator, Regional Dean /Director of Student Medical Education (DSME ) and the corresponding Third - or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs of any absence from a rotation, regardless of the reason or number of hours abse nt, may result in referral to the APPS Committee for failure to follow CUSOM policy and violation of CUSOM professionalism standards . 6.4.3. 6 Callback Fridays Students are required to return to Campbell University on the last Friday of the following clinical rotations: Family Medicin e, Medicine II, Obstetri cs/Gynecology, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Surgery, and Em ergency Medicine. During these sessions, end-of- rotation exams are tak en, and rotation specific pr e-preparation activities occur includi ng, but not limited t o, formal OSCEs; simulatio n; workshops; seminars; OMM practice, review, and practical app lication; residency application advising meetings with Clinical Chairs; and interprofessional events. Full attendance and participation in the entire d ay is MANDATORY. These sessions are scheduled from 8am-5pm; therefore, students should NOT make any travel plans prior to 5p m. These times m ay be subject to change. If a st udent is unable to attend Callb ack Friday due to illness, they will be required to make up BOTH the end-of-rotation exam and the rotation-specific pre-preparation activities in order to receive credit for completion of the rotation. Any emergency requiring absence from a Callback Friday must be communicated to the corresponding Third- or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs immediately. 205 Fourth-Year Callback Friday Requirements Attendance and active participation in a min imum of two (2) on - campus Callb ack Friday OMM workshops is required during the fourth year. The first will occur during Residency Development month, where the students are required to perform an OMM specific OSCE in a simulated outpatient setting. The second will occur when students return to campus to take their core emergency medicine end - of-rotation exam, and the students are required to attend an OMM workshop structured to help them develop strategies for integrating OMM into their post -graduate education. Students are always encouraged to attend additio nal Callback Friday activities in order to take advantage of additional practice, OMM and educational opportunities. Students who wish to attend additional Callback Friday activities must register in advance by contacting the Third - or Fourth -Year Clinical Coordinator . 6.4.3. 7 Holidays While on clinical rotations, students are excused only for holidays which are observed by their respective clinical site. If a student is assigned by a preceptor to work on a holiday, the student may NOT request the use of a discretionary day on that holiday. Third - and fourth -year students are required to follow the training site (e.g., hospital, clinic, office, health center) policies and procedures regarding holidays. All major holidays are observed at the discretion of the affiliated training site and must be reported to the Office of Clinical Af fairs. Students may request an excused absence for religious holidays not included in the list of recognized University holidays (Section 6.4.2 of this Bulletin ), however, t he submission of an excused request for this purpose does not guarantee approval will be granted. If a student is required to work on a holiday, the student may be given a day off during the holiday week at the discretion of the clinical preceptor or the Vice President of Medical Education/Regional Dean/DSME. 6.4.3.8 Consequences of Non-compliance to Attendance Policies As professionals, students are expected to strictly adhere to the attendance policy. For third - or fourth -year students , any unexcused absence while on clinical rotation will automatically result in a failure for that rotation and the student will be referred to the APPS Committee. In extreme cases, absen teeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program . 206 6.4.3. 9 Dismissal from a Rotation Site In the event a student is asked to leave the rotation site by the preceptor or clinical site staff, the student must IMM EDIATELY notify the Regional Dean/Director of Student Medical Education (DSME ) and the Office of Clinical Affairs (Associate Dean for Clinic al Affairs, Director of Clinical Rotations, Student Medical Education Clinic al Coordin ators for Third -Year or Fourth -Year) in person or by phon e. In addition, this communi cation must be follo wed by written documentation of the events and sent to the site coordinator and Office of Clini cal Affairs within the ensuing twenty - four (24) hours. 6.4.4 Severe Weather Policy If inclement weather results in changes to class schedules , a message will be posted via the website at www.campbell.edu and Facebook, Twitter, and through the Campbell University inclement weather line: On campus: dial 5700 Local, (910) 814-5700 Long distance: 1-800-760-8980 then dial 5700 It is recommended students visit the Campbell University website at https://www.campbell.edu/alerts/ to sign up to receive campus alerts. In the event of a campus -wide emergency, a text message with information about the emergency and actions to take will be sent to all enrollees . In the case of severe weather while on clinical rotations, students should fo llow the severe weather protocol of their specific clinical site . If the preceptor is present, the student should make every attempt to be present , as long as it is safe to do so .. If the student is unable to get to the clinical site due to unsafe road c onditions, the student must communicate this to their preceptor, their clinical campus Student Medical Education Coordinator and the Third - or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator immediately. Any time missed due to severe weather mu st be made up at the discretion of the preceptor, Regional Dean /Director of Student Medical Education (DSME ), and Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, keeping in mind students must complete the requirements for the rotation block in order to receive credit for the rotation. 6.4.5 Emergency Preparedness Plan Section O ne - Assessment of Risk CUSOM's guiding principle behind the assessment of risk in any potential emergency shall be the protection of life and safety of our students, faculty, and staff. Communication and coordination between the CUSOM Clinical Affairs Department and Regional Deans /Director of Student Medical Education ( DSMEs ), is crucial to assessing risks within the respective 207 clinical campus regions. CUSOM recognizes events affecting one region might not affect all regions due to the geographic dispersion of the clinical campuses . For events that are anticipated such as ice storms, hurricanes, or other known events, a meeting will be schedul ed 4-5 days in advance of the event to include the Dean of CUSOM, Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, Director and Assistant Director of Clinical Affairs, and Regional Deans /DSMEs to discuss the projected events and the plan for response by each Regional Dean /DSMEs. Regional Deans /DSMEs, shall be prepared to discuss their specific site response if the event is \"Green\" which would indicate minimal impact, \"Yellow\" which would indicate a medium level impact, and \"Red\" which would indicate a catastrophic eve nt. Event Category Description Green Event Minimal impact to life and property in the region with expected loss of utilities to last no longer than 1-2 days. Yellow Ev ent Mod erate impact to life and property in the region with potential loss of life and moderate damage to local structures. Uti lity failure projections of at least 3-7 days. Red Event Severe impact to life and property in the region with loss of life and severe damage to loc al structures. Parts of the area are uninhabitable for weeks. Water and sewer system f ailure with power loss projections of greater than 7 days. Regional Deans /DSMEs serve as the key point of contact for CUSOM and for its students in the respective regions and should print student contact information to keep with them until the event is over. The Regional Deans /DSMEs, or their representative, will be responsible for contactin g each student in their region to make them aware of plans for response to the event at least two (2) days in advance (if known in advance). In an unanticipated event, Regional Deans /DSMEs will have the authority to assess the risk and communicate their p lans with students and CUSOM Admin istration. Section T wo - Communication of Risk and Protection of Life and Safety CUSOM encourages students to sign up for alerts using the university's emergency alert system: https://campbell.omnilert.net/subscriber.php CUSOM will send emergency assessment information to students providing instructions on what to do, supplies they should have on hand, and key sources o f credible information during the event. 208 The Regional Dean /DSMEs will serve as the primary point of contact for students and communicate with them directly during an emergency by email, telephone, or text message. Section T hree - Identification of Student Whe reabouts and Status Each clinical campus will keep a current list of student cell phone numbers and addresses in a printable format that can be taken home for reference by the Regional Dean /DSMEs in an adverse event. If electronic communication is available, a survey may be conducted online requesting student response with their condition, location where sheltering, and any needs they may have. Section Four - Returning to Clinical Rotations Regional Deans/DSMEs will communicate with students in the region to provide specific instructions regarding when students may return to the facility. In addition, Regional Deans/DSMEs will provide students in the region information regarding any need for volunteers to assist in disaster response operations. Section Five - Educational Program Conti nuity Regional Deans /DSMEs in affected regions, along with the Clinical Affairs Department, will be in frequent contact to discuss whether relocation of affected students is necessary, to ensure educational program continuity. End-of-rotation exams and Callb ack Fridays may be rescheduled or alternate days offered depending on the impact of the event on students. Section Six - Resources for Displaced Students In the event of a catastrophic event, CUSOM may explore arranging temporary housing and assist with other needs to the extent possible. 6.5 Dress Code Policy Students must maintain a professional appearance and professional attire whenever on CUSOM grounds, including adjacent property at Campbell University and on all clinical experiences or rotations. Students must be professionally dressed for all lectures, examinations, laboratory classes , and workshops ; this includes all on -site and virtual sessions. All students are expected to wear business casual attire appropriate for a professional setting. Changing areas and lockers are provided for students to change into appropriate dress for OMM, Clinical Skills, and Anatomy labs. All students must have at least one short, white consultation jacket maintained in a clean and presentable condition. 209 A clean and well -cared -for appearance should be maintained. The apparel and appearance of faculty, staff, and students project, in part, the image the community has of the University. Faculty, staff, and students are expected to be neat, well - groomed, and appropriately dressed for the work and study they do. The clothing selected should not be distracting to faculty, staff, students , or patients . Shorts, jeans, sweatpants, scrubs, T-shirts , and athletic shoes are not permitted except in the OMM , Clinical Skills , and Anatomy labs when appropriate as designated in course syllabi . Revealing or tight, form-fitting clothing is unacceptable. Head coverings (unless for religious reasons), caps, hoodies , or sunglasses may not be worn during classes , labs or examinations. Any student wearing a head covering (unless for religious reasons), cap, hoodie, or sunglasses will be asked to remove it. Students inappropriately dressed or groomed may be required to leave the campus or their clinical rotation and not return until appropriately attired. Any class, lab, or clinical rotation missed during this time will be considered an unexcused absence. Questionable or disputed cases of dress or grooming shall be presented to the Office of Student Affairs or Department of Clinical Affairs, whose decision will be final. Repeated infractions may be considered a professionalism issu e resulting in referral to the APPS Committee. Certain educational experiences at CUSOM require a specific dress code. These include the laboratory classes of OMM, Anatomy, and Clinical Skills , and the required dress code is included in the respective syllabus for each course. 6.5.1 OMM Laboratory Dress Code The dress requirement in the OMM lab sessions is designed to promote learning by providing optimal access to diagnostic observation and palpatory experience. Wearing inappropriate clothing interferes with a partner's experience of diagnosis and treatment. Appropriate attire must be clean and includes any clothing that allows for easy visualization, examination, palpation, and treatment of the body areas being addressed. Students should a void wearing any heavy or thick -seamed clothing, clothing that restricts movement or visualization of the area under examination, and any inappropriately revealing clothing. During lab, students may nee d to remove their shirts to reveal the back, rib cage and abdomen. Women may wear sports bras or bathing suit tops beneath their shirts or scrubs during these lab sessions. Student s may wear scrubs, or other apparel approved by the Course Director, over laboratory attire when not in the role of the patient. 210 Students must remove their shoes when serving in the role of a patient (no shoes are permitted on the tables). Hats or other head coverings (other than for religious purposes) are not permitted in t he OMM lab. Religious head coverings are to be removed when they would obscure the immediate area to be examined or treated (e.g., head, neck, and upper back) and may be immediately replaced after this portion of OMM training. 6.5.2 Anatomy Laboratory Dress Code Lab coats , which are provided and laundered by CUSOM, are to be worn in the anatomy lab at all times. Students are also provided with disposable latex -free gloves, and if required, masks and face shield s. It is recommended student s wear scrubs or old clothes and shoes which can be discarded when the gross anatomy curriculum is over. Students should w ear appropriate clothing and comfortable shoes. The lab is cool, so warm clothing is recommended. Close d-toe shoes and long pants ar e required . Flip -flops, open ed-toe shoes, shorts , and spaghetti - strap tops are not permitted. For ultrasound laboratories, appropriate attire must be clean and includes clothing that allows for easy visualization, examination, and palpation of the body areas being addressed, which requires partial exposure of the body. On such days, students will be required to dress in a fashion that will allow examination of these areas (denoted as \"OMM Dress Code\" ; Section 6.5.1 ). Students should a void wearing any heavy or thick -seamed clothing; clothing that restricts movement or visualization of the area under examination; and any inappropriately re vealing clothing. Students may need to remove their shirts to reveal the back, rib cage and abdomen. Women may wear sports bras or bathing suit tops beneath their shirts or scrubs during these lab sessions. Hats or other head coverings (other than for religious purposes) are not permitted in anatomy or ultrasound labs. In ultrasound labs, religious head coverings are to be removed when they would obscure the immediate area to be examined (e.g., head, neck, and upper back) and may be immediately replaced after this portion of ultrasound training. Lockers are available in the locker rooms adjacent to the lab where stude nts may store their gross anatomy lab clothes. Students must provide their own locks and leave all their personal belongings in a locker instead of stacking them in the fourth -floor lobby outside the laboratory . In addition, the lockers are to be used when taking a gross anatomy practical exam. Students are not to leave their personal belongings in the fourth -floor lobby. 211 Protective eyewear is suggested but not required (students provide their own eyewear). Soft contact lenses are NOT recommended in the lab as they may absorb chemicals used in the laboratory. 6.5.3 Clinical Skills Laboratory Dress Code Students are expected to dress appropriately for Clinical Skills laboratory exercises. Appropriate dress varies based on the activity of the day and is clearly stated in the course syllabi. Unless otherwise stated, students will adhere to the standard \"CUSOM dress code\" as outlined in this Academic Bulletin (Section 6.5) . White consultation coats are requir ed for all Clinical Skills sessions. NO opened -toe shoes are permitted at any time during Clinical Skills sessions. Students are permitted to wear neat, clean athletic shoes or clogs when wearing \"scrubs\" or \"OMM dress code\"; Section 6.5.1. The laboratory sessions during Clinical Skills involve physical examination of classmates, models, and standardized patients , and students are expected to demonstrate professionalism when examining patients and classmates. The development of a professional ap proach to performing a physical exam is crucial and s tudents are required to fully participate in Clinical Skills labs which require physical examination. Randomly selected student lab partners allow for a broad range of exposure and experience diagnosing and treating patients with different body types, both male and female. No student will be required to examine, or be examined by, a classmate or faculty member for breast, genital, or rectal exams. However, there will be sessions, such as when practicin g examination of the heart, lungs, abdomen, or extremities, which will require partial exposure of the body. On such days, students will be required to dress in a fashion that will allow examination of these areas (denoted as \"OMM Dress Code\" ; Section 6.5 .1). Ladies should wear sports bras or bathing suit tops when exposure of the thorax is needed. No short shorts, tight garments, or attire with inappropriate slogans, are allowed in Clinical Skills Lab sessions. Lab sessions requiring \"scrubs\" are announced in advance and will be delineated in the course syllabus . White coats must be worn f or all encoun ters with Standardized Patients . Professional dress and a white coat are required for ALL Final OSCE Examinations. Faculty and staff reserve the r ight to refuse admission to students not compliant with the dress code as set forth in this document. Students who are not permitted to participate in a Clinical Skills, Simulation or OSCE lab or exam due to non -adherence to the dress code will receive an unexcused absence and may be issued a grade of zero (0 ) for any graded exercise. 212 6.6 Academic Standing and Academic Progress 6.6.1 Academic Standing Academic Standing is defined as a student's academic status at any time within the four -year CUSOM curriculum. CUSOM must attest to the NBOME that each CUSOM student is in Good Academic and Professional Standing prior to sitting for COMLEX -USA Level 1 and COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE. As such, a student Not in Good Academic and Professional Standing will not be approved to sit for COMLEX . A student who is considered in Good Academic Standing is one with officially recorded, passing grades in all completed courses and clinical rotations attempted at any given point in time. This includes all students who hav e successfully remediated a failed course or a clinical rotation. A student Not in Good Academic Standing is one with any unresolved (e.g., non-remediated or failed ) course or clinical rotation failing grade at any given point in time. Academic Standing is used, in part, to determine student eligibility to participate in CUSOM -approved activities, such as conferences, student organizations, etc. Academic Standing and GPA requirements for student eligibility to serve as an SGA or club officer, participate in CUSOM -sponsored research, serve on a CUSOM Committee, and receive an approved absence to attend any off -campus conference or meeting are delineated in Sections 6.4.2, 6.4.3.4, and 7.3.1 of this Bulletin. 6.6.1.1 Academic Warning The APPS Committee will place a student on Academic Warning for a defined term if the student fails a course or clinical rotation. The APPS Committee reviews the record of each student on Academic Warning at the end of the defined term of the Academic Warning to evaluate t he student's academic progress, and makes recommendations regarding the continuation or removal of Academic Warning. Academic Warning will not appear on the student's official transcript and will not be included in the Medical Student Performance Evaluation ( MSPE ). Students on Academic Warning are not eligible to serve as a Student Government, club or organization officer, serve on a CUSOM committee, receive an approved absence to attend an off -campus conference or meeting, serve as a Teaching Ass istant, or participate in CUSOM -sponsored research, such as the Sum mer Research Scholars program. 213 Students on Academic Warning generally require modifications to their study strategies in order to succeed academically and as such are encouraged to utilize opportunities afforded by the CUSOM Academic Center for Excellence (ACE), Student Affairs, Behavioral Health, faculty, and peer -tutors. 6.6.1.2 Academic Probation The APPS Committee will place a student on Academic Probation for a defined term if the student fails multipl e courses or clinical rotations; fails CO MLEX -USA Level -1 or Level 2 -CE; fails a course, clinical rotation , fails to make satisfactory academic progress while on Academic Warning ; or other academic issues as deemed relevant to warrant the sanction of Academic Probation. The APPS Committee review s the record of each student on Academic Probation at the end of the defined term to evaluate the student's academic progress, and makes recommendations regarding the continuation or removal of Academic Probation. Academic Probation will appear on the student's official transcript, along with the date the Academic Probation was instituted, and rectified. Academic Probation will be included in the Medical Student Performance Evaluatio n (MSPE) , and applications for state medical licens es where required . Students on Academic Probation are not eligible to serve as a Student Government, club or organization officer, serve on a CUSOM committee, receive an approved absence to attend an off-campus conference or meeting, serve as a Teaching Assistant, or participate in CUSOM -sponsored research, such as the Summer Research Scholars program. Academic Probation is a more significant sanction than Academic Warning, and any additional course o r clinical rotation failures may result in Dismissal from the program. 6.6.2 Academic Progress Years 1 and 2 Academic Progress for students in Years 1 and 2 of the curriculum requires passing all courses in all Blocks in a sequential manner (i.e., all curricular requirements for Block 1 must be satisfied before a student may start Block 2; Block 2 requirements before Block 3; and Block 3 requirements before Block 4, etc.) , successfully completing all curricular require ments in the Blocks and meeting the requirements as set forth by the APPS Committee for students, 214 including those in a Modified Course of Study. Stud ents must also demonstrate adequate development in professionalism as determined by the faculty and admini stration. Completion of all Year 1 curricular requirements must be satisfied before a student is promoted to, and may start, Year 2 coursework. In order to be permitted to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1, the student must pass the CABS II course and all prior coursework (i.e., be in good academic standing) as delineated in Section 6.6. 4.1 of this Bulletin , as well as any other requirements as set forth by the NBOME. Students who pass the CABS II course and have met all other curricular requirements for Years 1 and 2 are considered \"provisional\" third -year students and allowed to participate in clinical rotations. Full third -year status is not granted until a student passes COMLEX -USA Level 1. Years 3 and 4 Successful academic progress for students in Years 3 and 4 of the curriculum includes successful completion of all clinical rotations, end -of-rotation exams, and any other requirements, including but not limited to, clinical modules, procedure and patient logs, Callb ack Fridays, and their evaluations of the site and their preceptor. In addition, students who have been placed in a Modified Course of Study must meet any requirements set forth by the APPS Committee. Each student must pass the COMLEX -USA Leve l 2 Cognitive Evaluation (CE) as well as the COMLEX -USA Level 2 Physical Examination (PE) * prior to graduation. * NOTE: COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE was suspended indefinitely in February 2021, and formally discontinued in June 2022. COMLEX -USA candidates are currently verified by attestation from their COM dean that they are proficient in these important clinical skills. Additi onal information is available on the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners COMLEX - USA Level 2 -PE website . As such, to be eligible to graduate, each student must have successfully completed CUSOM's Clinical Skills Assessment Program, which includes both a longitudinal assessment of student performance and an on -campus multi -station Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE) during the fourth year. This multi -station OSCE, also called the Physical Exam -Qualifying Exam (PE -QE), requires students to demonstrate successfully the fundamental clinical skills and physician -related competency domains required for gradua tion, entrance into supervised graduate medical education programs, and the provision of safe osteopathic medical care of patients. 215 In order to be permitted to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE, the student must achieve a passing score on a CUSOM -identified Q ualifying Exam (QE) and have passed all prior coursework (i.e., be in good academic standing) as delineated in Section 6.6. 4.5 of this Bulletin, as well as any other requirements as set forth by the NBOME. Students who do not pass the QE after three (3) consecutive attempts are referred to the APPS Committee and required to choose to participate in a Board review program or can elect to go on Suspension to study on their own as delineated in Section 6.6. 4.6 of this Bulletin. Students who experience difficulty successfully completing any element (s) of the CUSOM curriculum or any level of the COMLEX examination series in a timely manner according to the academic calendar and requirements set forth in this Bulletin may be required to enter a Modified Course of Study, and in cases of COMLEX -related failures , to complete a board preparation program . Students placed in a Modified Course of Study must agree to comply with the plan as determined by the APPS Committee. A s long as the student is making satisfactory progress in the Modified Course of Study, they will remain in full - time status. Students who do not follow the Modified Course of Study, or who do not make satisfactory academic progress while in a Modified Cou rse of Study, may be referred to the APPS Committee for additional required remediation, or additional sanctions up to, and including, dismissal from the program. 6.6.3 Six (6) Year Graduation Requirement In accordance with COCA standards, single degree DO students must complete their education within 150% of the standard time (six (6) years following matriculation ). To become eligible for graduation, each student must successfully complete all graduation requirements (as delinea ted in Section 6.9.1 of this Bulletin) within six (6) years following matriculation. The six (6) years allow for the completion of a Modified Course of Study due to medical, academic, behavioral, or other leave s of absence. The Dean may grant an extension to this 6 -year rule, in exceptional circumstances. Fourth -year students should refer to Section 6.9.1 of this Bulletin for further information regarding graduation requirements. 216 Students not making satisfactory academic progress towards graduation will be referred to the APPS Committee for review and further recommendations, which may include but is not limited to, placement on a Modified Course of Study, Academic Probation or Dismissal from the program. 6.6.4 National Boa rd (Licensing) Exams Students are required to pass the COMLEX -USA Level 1, COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE, and the COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE* prior to graduation as outlined in the table of milestones below. A student is permitted only three (3) attempts to pass COMLEX -USA Level 1 and only three (3) attempts to pass COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE. Failure to achieve a passing score in three (3) attempts on either Level will result in the student being dismissed from the program. In order to be permitted to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1 and Le vel 2 -CE, the student must be in good standing (academic and non -academic) and also satisfactorily complete a Qualifying Process which may include achieving a pre-identified \"passing\" score on a Qualifying Exam (QE) such as a CUSOM - proctored College of Osteopathic Medicine Self -Assessment Exam (COMSAE) or a similar exam. CUSOM identifie s the passing parameters prior to each Qualifying Exam. Students are permitted to register for COMLEX -USA Level 1 or Level 2 -CE prior to passing the required Qualifying Exam (QE); however, students failing satisfactorily complete the Qualifying Process are not permitted to take COMLEX -USA Level 1 or Level 2 -CE. The CABS II (OMED 690) course during Block 8 serves as a capstone to the first two years of the curriculum. This credit -bearing course is designed to review, integrate, and consolidate the content from the first two years with the requisite knowledge and skills for clinical rotations. Completion of this course will also prepare students for successful passage of COMLEX -USA Level 1 and entry into third -year clinical rotations. Prior to receiving t heir COMLEX -USA Level 1 scores, all students, including those on appeal for failure to complete any required coursework, are considered \"provisional\" third -year students and allowed to participate in clinical rotations. Full third -year status is not grant ed until a student passes COMLEX -USA Level 1. 217 Academic Progress M ilestones Successful Completion of All Courses During Blocks 1 -8 Satisfactory Completion of a Qualifying Process for COMLEX -USA Level 1 Successful Completion of COM LEX-USA Level 1 Successful Completion of All COM AT/Equ ivalent Subject Examinations Satisfactory Evaluation by Clinical Faculty for Each Clinical Rotation Successful Completion of Third-Year Rotations and OSCEs Satisfactory Completion of a Qualifying Process for COMLEX -USA Level 2-CE Successful Completion of COM LEX-USA Level 2-CE Successful Completion of COM LEX-USA Level 2-PE Equivalent* Successful Completion of Fourth -Year Rotations * NOTE: COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE was suspended indefinitely in February 2021, and formally discontinued in June 2022. COMLEX -USA candidates are currently verified by attestation from their COM dean that they are proficient in these important clinical skills. Additi onal information is available on the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners COMLEX - USA Level 2 -PE website . As such, to be eligible to graduate, each student must have successfully completed CUSOM's Clinical Skills Assessment Program, which includes both a longitudinal assessment of student performance and an on -campus multi -station Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE) during the fourth year. This multi -station OSCE, also called the Physical Exam -Qualifying Exam (PE -QE), requires students to demonstrate successfully the fundamental clinical skills and physician -related competency domains required for gradua tion, entrance into supervised graduate medical education programs, and the provision of safe osteopathic medical care of patients. Accommodations on COMLEX-USA Exams Students who want to request accommodations for any COMLEX -USA examination must submit their applications directly to the NBOME within the timeframe designated by the NBOME. Information regarding testing accommodations for COMLEX -USA examinations is available on the NBOME's Test Accommodations website . CUSOM is not responsible for requesting or approving COMLEX -USA testing accommodations. Note: The NBOME has specific accommodation criteria and may deny a student's accommodation request, even if that student has been granted accommodations by CUSOM. 218 6.6.4.1 COMLEX-USA Level 1 In order to be permitted to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1, the student must satisfactorily complete a Qualifying Process. Students are permitted to register for COMLEX -USA Level 1 prior to passing the Qualifying Exam (QE) ; however, students failing to meet the minimum CUSOM pre -identified score on the QE are not permitted to take COMLEX -USA Level 1. Students must complete th e Clinical Applications of Biomedical Sciences (CABS) I and II courses in Blocks 5 and 8, respectively, and MUST sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1 prior to the start of Simulation Medicine (OMED 770), the first rotation of the third academic year, depending on the Qualifying Process. Students are permitted to register for COMLEX -USA Level 1 prior to passing the CABS II (OMED 690) c ourse. Students are not permitted to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1 until they pass the CABS II course , which requires passage of the QE (see Section 6.6.2) . A student who fails the CABS II course is not in good academic standing and, per NBOME regulations, is not eligible t o sit for the COMLEX -USA Level 1 exam. Students who have passed CABS II must sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1 prior to the start of the Simulation Medicine (OMED 770) rotation. Students are not permitted to begin clinical rotations until they have taken COMLEX -USA Level 1. Permission to remain on r otations is contingent on passing COMLEX -USA Level 1. Please note that all COMs are required by the NBOME to provide attestation that the student is in good academic and professional standing before the NBOME will allow a student to sit for COMLEX -USA Lev el 1. Eligibility requirements for COMLEX - USA Level 1 are provided on the NBOME website . Per this Bulletin, students have a maximum of three (3) attempts to pass COMLEX -USA Level 1. 219 6.6.4.2 Qualifying Process to sit for COMLEX-USA Level 1 Students who pass the first or second Qualifying Exam Students who pass a Qualifying Exam (QE) for COMLEX -USA Level 1 (QE -L1) on the first (QE -L1-1) or second (QE -L1-2) attempt will have successfully completed the CABS II (OMED 690) course (earning a grade of P) and are eligible to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1, which must be taken by the beginning of the Simulation Medicine (OMED 770) r otation. CUSOM determines the passing score on each Qualifying Exam such as a CUSOM -proctored College of Osteopathic Medicine Self - Assessment Exam (COMSAE) or a similar exam. CUSOM pays for the first Qualifying Exam (QE -L1-1); however , students are responsible for the cost of subsequent exams. Students who do not pass the first or second Qualifying Exam A student who does not pass a Level 1 Qualifying Exam (QE) on their first (QE-L1-1) or second (QE -L1-2) attempt is placed in a Modified Course of Study (MCOS ; see Section 6.6.5 of this Bulletin ), during which they are required to complete a Board preparation program of study, not to exceed 90 -days in duration. If the student is already on a MCOS, adjustments to the MCOS may be required. In either case, a MCOS may result in a delay in the student's completion of CUSOM graduation requirements, which may in turn affect their ability to participate in the residency match process. The Boards preparation program cannot exceed 90 -days duration, and the student is required to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1 for the second attempt no later than 14 -days following successful completion of the Boards preparation program of study . The student i s required to choose, and successfully complete, one of the following Options in order to pass the CABS II (OMED 690) course (earn a grade of P) and be released to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1. Kaplan Program (Option 1) Boards Boot Camp Program (Option 2) PASS Program (Option 3) Voluntarily choose to take a Suspension (Option 4) o Students who voluntarily choose to take a Suspension (Option 4) may utilize any Board preparation materials or 220 programs of their choice and are permitted to take COMLEX at the time o f their choosing, however they must provide evidence of a passing score on COMLEX -USA Level 1 within 180 days of the start of the suspension or they will be dismissed from CUSOM. Earning a passing score on COMLEX -USA Level 1 will also result in a passing grade on CABS II. Students participating in a Boards preparation program must meet all program requirements, which includes, but is not limited to, strict adherence to all timelines related to the completion of study assignments and assessment examinations. Failure to do so will result in referral to the APPS Committee for non -adherence to the agreed process and m ay result in sanctions up to and including Suspension or Dismissal. OPTION 1: The student is required to complete the Kaplan Board preparation program. This program is four weeks in duration and primarily consists of faculty -delivered presentations focused on high yield topics in advance of the licensing exam. The presentations are provided by faculty identified by Kaplan as excellen t in their disciplines, and with significant experience in Board preparation. Students must attend this four -week component of the CABS II course AND achieve a passing score on the third Qualifying Exam (QE -L1-3). The passing score for the third Qualifyi ng Exam (QE -L1-3) is determined after administration of this exam and is based upon class statistics, in a manner consistent with common practices in higher education and CUSOM grading practices across the four -year curriculum. The qualifying score is det ermined based upon cohort performance with contextual reference to prior cohort's performance on qualifying examinations as well as on licensure examinations. Qualifying exam scores do not round up and failing to achieve a passing score is not appealable. Failure to achieve the qualifying score requirement on the third Qualifying Exam (QE -L1-3) will result in a failing grade for the CABS II course and referral to the APPS Committee. Remediation, if granted, is determined by the APPS Committee. 221 A student who has failed the third Qualifying Exam (QE-L1-3) in this path will be placed on a Modified Course of Study (MCOS; see Section 6.6.5) and be required to select Option 2 (Boards Boot Camp), 3 (PASS Program), or 4 (Voluntary Suspension) as described below. The student cannot start clinical rotations until successfully completing the selected program and sitting for COMLEX -USA Level 1 (if option 2 or 3) or submitting verification of a passing COMLEX -USA Level 1 score (if selecting Option 4 - voluntary suspe nsion). Similarly, participation in the Simulation Medicine (OMED 770) rotation may be impacted as well. OPTION 2: The student is required to complete The Boards Boot Camp Ultra Board preparation program. The Boards Boot Camp Ultra Program (http://www.boardsbootcamp.com ) is taken at the student's expense and will not exceed a timeframe established by the APPS Committee. The student is not allowed to start clinical rotations until they sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1. Permission to continue on rotations is contingent upon passing COMLEX -USA Level 1. Students are not permitted to sit for COMLEX-USA Level 1 until Boards Boot Camp confirms to CUSOM successful compl etion of the program. Students will be placed on a modified Course of Study (MCOS; see Section 6.6. 5) if their COMLEX -USA Level 1 test date falls after the conclusion Simulation Medicine (OMED 770), the first rotation of the third academic year. If BBC requires a student to complete an NBOME COMSAE as part of the program, CUSOM will purchase the COMS AE directly from the NBOME and bill the cost of the exam to the student's account. Students will allow CUSOM access to, and share as necessary, the results and scores for any practice exams, including, b ut not limited to any NBOME COMSAE exams. 222 Students must adhere to the directions and program requirements of BBC, which includes strict adherence to all timelines related to the completion of study assignments and the Post -Course Diagnostic Exam (PCDE ) or other equivalent exam as determined by BBC . Failure to pass the PCDE (or other equivalent exam as determined by BBC) may result in a return visit to APPS Committee for further review as delineated in this Bulletin. Once a student passes the PCDE (or other equivalent exam as determined by BBC) and has successfully completed the program per BBC, they must sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1 by the date identified in their plan, which can be no later than 14 days following the PCDE (or other equivalent exam as determined by BBC) unless approved by BBC and the APPS Committee. Failure to do so may result in a return visit to APPS Committee for further review as delineated in this Bulletin. Failure to pass the PCDE, meet necessary timeline requirements, or otherwi se not gain approval by BBC to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1, will result in a failing grade for the CABS II course and referral to the APPS Committee. Failure to follow the timeline established by BBC or any subsequent further delay in sitting for COMLEX - USA Level 1 may delay the student's graduation date and adversely impact the ability to participate in the residency match process. OPTION 3: The student is required to complete the PASS Board preparation program. The student may choose either the in-person or virtual PASS program option ( https:/ /www.pass - program.com/ ). This program is at the student's expense and will not exceed a timeframe established by the APPS Committee. The student is not allowed to start clinical rotations until they sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1. Permission to continue on rotations is contingent upon passing COMLEX -USA Level 1. 223 Students are not permitted to sit for COMLEX-USA Level 1 until the PASS Program confirms to CUSOM successful compl etion of the program. Students will be placed on a modified Course of Study (MCOS; see Section 6.6. 5) if their COMLEX -USA Level 1 test date falls after the conclusion of Simulation Medicine (OMED 770), the first rotation of the third academic year. If PASS requires a student to complete an NBOME COMSAE as part of the program, CUSOM will purchase the COMSAE directly from the NBOME and bill the cost of the exam to the student's account. Students will allow CUSOM access to, and share as necessar y, the results and scores for any practice exams, including, but not limited to any NBOME COMSAE exams. Students must adhere to the directions and program requirements of PASS. Once a student successfully completes the PASS program, they must sit for COM LEX -USA Level 1 by the date identified in their plan, which can be no later than 14 days following the completion of the program, unless approved by the PASS program and the APPS Committee. Failure to do so may result in a return visit to APPS Committee for further review as delineated in this Bulletin. Failure to meet necessary timeline requirements, or otherwise not gain approval by the PASS Program to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1, will result in a failing grade for the CABS II course and referral to the APPS Committee. Remediation, if granted, is determined by the APPS Committee. Failure to follow the timeline established by PASS or any subsequent further delay in sitting for COMLEX - USA Level 1 may delay the student's graduation date and adversely impac t the ability to participate in the residency match process. Failure to do so may result in a return visit to APPS Committee for further review as delineated in this Bulletin. OPTION 4: The student voluntarily chooses to be placed on Suspension, during which time they may utilize any Board preparation materials or programs of their choice. 224 Suspension is defined as a temporary separation from the institution and during this period students are not enrolled, not registered and not eligible for financial ai d. Students choosing Option 4 are not permitted to return from Suspension and begin clinical rotations until they achieve a passing score on COMLEX -USA Level 1. Per this Bulletin, students have a maximum of three (3) attempts to pass COMLEX -USA Level 1 , or they will be dismissed from CUSOM. If the student is on Suspension, verification of a passing score on COMLEX -USA Level 1 must be provided within 180 days of the start of Suspension. While on Suspension, students must not represent themselves as CUSOM students. In addition, they may not be on the University campus or affiliated clinical campuses, participate in any clinical activities or wear their CUSOM white coat. If the terms set out under the Suspension are not fulfilled, or the student exceeds the Suspension term of 180 calendar days, the student will be referred to the APPS Committee for dismissal from the program. 6.6.4.3 Rescheduling a COMLEX Exam All students are responsible for coordinating with the NBOME their own logist ics, and their own payment methods, to sit for COMLEX examinations. CUSOM is not responsible for any fees associated with scheduling or rescheduling COMLEX dates. NBOME requirements, including fee schedules, may be found on the NBOME website . Students are encouraged to consider the costs of these exams, and rescheduling fees, in planning their budgets. Please note that all COMs are required by the NBOME to provide attestation that the student is in good academic and professional standing before the NBOME will allow a student to sit for a COMLEX examination. Eligibility requirements for COMLEX - USA Level 1 are provided on the NBOME website . Although a student must schedule a COMLEX test date, CUSOM must approve the student to sit for the exam. As such, if a stude nt fails a course (e.g., CABS II at the end of Block 8) or a clinical rotation which has not been successfully remediated , the student would not be 225 in good academic standi ng and CUSOM is obligated to cancel the approval for the scheduled test date per NBOME regulations . Once the failed grade is rectified, the student may reschedule the licensing exam. 6.6.4.4 Failure of COMLEX -USA Level 1 Failure of COMLEX -USA Level 1 on the First Attempt A student who fails COMLEX -USA Level 1 on their initial attempt is removed from clinical rotations , not allowed to resume clinical rotations until they sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1 a second time, placed on Academic Probation, and referred to the APPS Committee. The student is placed in a Modified Course of Study (MCOS ; see Section 6.6. 5), during which they are required to complete a Board preparation program of study, not to exceed 90 -days in duration. If the student is already on a MCOS, adjustments to the MCOS may be required. In either case, a MCOS may resul t in a delay in the student's completion of CUSOM graduation requirements, which may in turn affect their ability to participate in the residency match process. The Boards preparation program cannot exceed 90 -days duration, and the student is required to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1 for the second attempt no later than 14 -days following successful completion of the Boards preparation program of study . Students participating in a Boards preparation program of study must meet all associated program of study requirements, which includes, but is not limited to, strict adherence to all timelines related to the completion of study assignments and assessment examinations. Failure to do so will result in referral to the APPS Committee for non -adherence to the agre ed process and may result in sanctions up to and including Suspension or Dismissal. The APPS Committee will provide the student with a list of possible Board preparation programs of study - Multiple Options Pathway (MOP). The student will choose a progra m(s) of study they wish to use as they prepare for the second attempt at COMLEX -USA Level 1. Any associated costs of these programs are at the student's expense and the student must complete the program(s) of study within ninety (90) days from star t of th e first program of study. 226 Failure to follow the timeline established by a program of study, to complete the program within 90 days, or to sit for COMLEX - USA Level 1 within 14 days of completion of the program will result in referral to the APPS Committe e for non -adherence to the agreed process and may result in sanctions up to and including Suspension (see Section 6.8.5) or Dismissal (see Section 6.8.6) . Students are not permitted to return from Suspension and resume clinical rotations until they achieve a passing score on COMLEX - USA Level 1. Per the DO Academic Bulletin, students have a maximum of three (3) attempts to pass COMLEX -USA Level 1 .

As such, to be eligible to graduate, each student must have successfully completed CUSOM's Clinical Skil ls Assessment Program, which includes both a longitudinal assessment of student performance and an on-campus multi -station Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE) during the fourth year. This multi - station OSCE, also called the Physical Exam - Qualifying Exam (PE -QE), requires students to demonstrate successfully the fundamental clinical skills and physician -related competency domains required for graduation, entrance into supervised graduate medical education programs, and the provision of safe osteopathi c medical care of patients. 6.6.4.10 COMLEX -USA Graduation Requirements Students must pass COMLEX COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE and COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE* in order to meet graduation requirements . * NOTE: COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE was suspended indefinitely in February 2021, and formally discontinued in June 2022. As such, to be eligible to graduate, each student must have successfully completed the on -campus multi -station Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE), also called the Physical Exam -Qualifying Exam (PE -QE), during the fourth year as previously described. 236 Students are allowed a maximum of three (3) attempts to pass COMLEX -USA Level 1 and three (3) attempts to pass COMLEX - USA Level 2 -CE. Failure to pass any of these exams (COMLEX Level 1, Level 2 -CE, or CUSOM's Physical Exam -Qualifying Exam - PE-QE) during the required timeframe will result in a referral to the APPS Committee and dismissal from the program. 6.6.5 Modified Course of Study A Modified Course of Study (MCOS) is a credit -bearing, individualized study plan for students who require an alternative educational pathway for reasons such as required remediation, approved board preparation, illness, Leave of Absence , or Withdrawal . The MCOS will be individually designed based upon the student's performance and needs as designated by the APPS Committee or respective Associate Dean and approved by the APPS Committee . If the student is already on a MCOS, adjustments to the MCOS may be re quired. In either case, a MCOS may result in a delay in the student's completion of CUSOM graduation requirements, which may in turn affect their ability to participate in the residency match process. Students in a MCOS must agree to, and comply with, the conditions and schedule of the MCOS . Students not following the individualized plan will be referred to the APPS Committee for review and may be subject to additional sanctions up to and including Suspension or dismiss al from the program. Students in a MCOS should be aware that they must complete all program requirements, including COMLEX -USA Level 1 and Level 2, to graduate, enter ERAS (Electronic Residency Application Service) and participate in the residency Match. Students who fail COMLEX Level 2 -CE after the Match may lose their matched position. In addition, students who fail to meet their graduation requirements in adequate time to start their residency program may also lose their matched position. These decisi ons are made by the Residency Program Director or Director of Medical Education at the respective clinical program. MCOS for COMLEX or Qualifying Exams A MCOS is not intended to provide extra time to prepare for licensing examinations simply because a student would like more time to study and prepare for these examinations. Students cannot request to be placed on a MCOS; rather, a student is placed on a MCOS by the A PPS Committee or respective Associate Dean if an alternative educational pathway is required. 237 A student in a MCOS who does not adhere to the requirements and parameters of the MCOS, including but not limited to, compliance with established timelines or following directions of an assigned program such as Boards Boot Camp or the PASS Program, may be referred to the APPS Committee for further review and may be subject to additional sanctions up to and including Suspension or dismissal from the program . If the student is already on a MCOS, adjustments to the MCOS may be required. In either case, a MCOS may result in a delay in the student's completion of CUSOM graduation requirements, which may in turn affect their ability to participate in the residency ma tch process. Boards preparation program s cannot exceed 90 -days duration, and the student is required to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1 or 2 -CE no later than 14-days following successful completion of the Boards preparation program of study. Students participating in a Boards preparation program of study must meet all associated program of study requirements, which includes, but is not limited to, strict adherence to all timelines related to the completion of study assignments and assessment examinatio ns. Failure to do so will result in referral to the APPS Committee for non -adherence to the agreed process and may result in sanctions up to and including Suspension or Dismissal. If a student fails COMLEX -USA Level 1, COMLEX Level 2 - CE, or fail s to achieve a passing score on the Qualifying Exam for COMLEX -USA Level 2 - CE, the APPS Committee be will provide the student with a list of possible Board preparation programs of study - Multiple Options Pathway (MOP). The student will choose a program(s) of stu dy they wish to use as they prepare for the subsequent attempt on that exam . Any associated costs of these programs are at the student's expense and the student must complete the program(s) of study within ninety (90) days from start of the first program of study. Failure to follow the timeline established by a program of study, to complete the program within 90 days, or to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1 or 2-CE within 14 days of completion of the program will result in referral to the APPS Committee for non -adherence to the agreed process and may result in sanctions up to and including Suspension (see Section 6.8.5) or Dismissal (see Section 6.8.6). Students who choose, or are placed on, suspension are not permitted to return from Suspension and resume clinical rotations until they achieve a passing score on COMLEX -USA Level 1 or 2 -CE. 238 While on Suspension verification of a passing score on COMLEX -USA Level 1 or COMLEX -USA Level 2-CE must be provided within 180 da ys of the start of Suspension. If the terms set out under the Suspension are not fulfilled, or the student exceeds the Suspension term of 1 80 calendar days, the student will be referred to the APPS Committee for dismissal from the program. 6.6.6 Six (6) -Year Graduation Requirement In accordance with COCA standards, single degree DO students must complete their education within 150% of the standard time ( six (6) years following matriculation). To become eligible for graduation, each student must successfully complete all program requirements within six (6) years following matriculation. The six (6) years allow for the completion of a Modified Course of Study due to medical, academic, or other leave of absence. The Dean may grant an extension to this 6 -year rule in exceptional circumstances . 6.7 Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee The APPS Committee, in conjunction with the Office of Academic Affairs, monitors the academic progress achieved by all students throughout the entire CUSOM academic program. Additionally, the APPS Committee is responsible for the review of situations where students are involved in academic misconduct (i.e., cheating or plagiarism), non - academic violations of the Honor Code or Code o f Conduct, unprofessional conduct, or grievances . Additional information regarding these violations and corresponding procedures is found in this Bulletin at Sections 6.7.3 Honor Code , 6.7.4 Code of Conduct , and 6.10 Grievance Processes. The APPS Committee is appo inted by the Dean, and membership may be subject to change at any time. The Registrar and Office of Student Affairs participate as voting members. A quorum is defined as a simple majority of the members. The committee Chair, with approval of the Dean, may invite non -voting members to attend. APPS Committee meetings are not legal hearings, and as such, neither attorn eys nor other representatives (e.g. , healthcare providers) are allowed to participate . Faculty Recusal from APPS Committee Hearings Per the CUSOM Faculty Recusal Policy (Section 6.2.2 of this Bulletin), a ny CUSOM faculty member who is a health care professional with a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship with a CUSOM student, in any CUSOM program, must recuse themselves 239 from all activities involving the summative assessment, grading, and promotion of that student. In the case of committee m eetings, including, but not limited to, the Academic Performance, Progress and Standards (APPS) Committee, the committee Chair (or designee) will call for a declaration of any conflict of interest from committee members prior to student case discussions. Any APPS C ommittee member(s) identifying a potential conflict , including a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship with a student , will be required to recuse themselves and exit the meeting until that student's case is concluded . 6.7.1 Procedures for Calling and Conducting an APPS Committee Meeting Regarding Academic Matters The APPS Committee meets at the end of any Block or clinical rotation after the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs or the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs have determined all grades : (i) to review students who have achieved a failing course or clinical rotation grade, or failed to successfully remediate a failed course , (ii) when a delay in a student's academic progress is identified, or (iii) when deemed necessary. Any student who has failed a course in a Block must be available to meet in - person with the APPS Committee on Friday of Final Exam week per the Block schedule. The Chair of the APPS Committee or the appropriate Associate Dean for the academic year involve d may also call a meeting of the APPS Committee in cases where the academic progress of a student is affected by a Leave of Absence or other factors. Students cannot request a meeting of the APPS Committee for any reason including to challenge or appeal a n APPS Committee decision; appeal able sanctions are handled through the Dean as outlined in Section 6.7.8 or through the Grievance procedures outlined in Section 6.10 of this Bulletin. Reasons f or an APPS Committee hearing include, but are not limited to , if a student has: Failed a course; Attempted and failed to remediate a course; Failed to pass any course while on Academic Probation; Failed a clinical rotation; Failed an end -of-rotation exam; Failed to pass a COMLEX -USA Qualifying Exam within the required timeframe or number of attempts; Failed to pass an appropriate COMLEX-USA examination; or Failed to make academic progress, or follow directives set forth, in an assigned remediation plan, any Board preparation program, or any Modified Course of Study. 240 Upon initial review of a referral of a student to the APPS Committee, the Chair of the APPS Committee has the discretion to determine an intermediary action, such as the student meeting with the appropriate Associate Dean or other designated individual , which may be warranted in an effort to resolve the issue in lieu of an APPS Committee hearing. The Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, or designee, will Chair the APPS Committee. Members of the APPS Committee , depending on the academic year of the student, have the following roles: The appropriate Associate Dean for the academic year involved reports on the academic progress of student(s), as necessary. The Associate Dean may submit a written or oral repo rt documenting assistance the student has received or been offered, including , but not limited to , tutoring or advising. The Course Director, Department Chair, or the student's Faculty Advisor may be invited to an APPS Committee meeting to comment on student performance and related topics, as necessary. The Office of Student Affairs may report on documentation the Office of Student Affairs has which may be relevant to the student's academic progress. The Registrar is available to discuss the student's academic record , if needed. The APPS Committee Chair shall identify a secretary to record minutes and to ensure all communications occur in a timely manner. Each student reviewed by the APPS Committee is provided the opportunity to make a maximum of a ten -minute oral presentation (no PowerPoint presentations or handouts except for wr itten reports from a healthcare provider ) relevant to any issues or considerations the student wishes to make known to the APPS Committee. Members of the APPS Committee may then directly question the student. This is the only portion of the meeting at which the student may be physically present. In lieu of an in -person oral presentation, the student may be allowed to phone or videoconference (e.g., Zoom or WebEx) into the APPS Committee meeting and has the option to submit a written document prior to t he meeting , no more than two pages, single -spaced. These options are only available upon approval by the Chair of the APPS Committee, pending a valid reason for not presenting in-person. Students who fail to appear at a scheduled meeting or provide a wri tten document may be reviewed in absentia by the APPS Committee. Students are prohibited from recording (in audio or video format) any APPS or ad hoc Committee meetings or proceedings, including those held via phone or videoconference. 241 The APPS Committee will not accept or consider any additional information from the student, or on behalf of the student, after the student has exited the APPS Committee meeting , except where the information (a) was not available at the time of the meeting and before deliberation, or (b) is deemed relevant by the committee during deliberation . All sessions of the APPS Committee are closed to all individuals except those immediately concerned in the case. APPS Committee meetings are not considered legal hearings, therefore neither attorneys nor other representatives (e.g., healthcare providers) are allowed to attend. All persons present at the proceedings shall be bound to disclose no more than the Committee does in its official report on the case. As mentioned p reviously, a ny APPS Committee member(s) identifying a potential conflict of interest, including a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship with a student, will be required to recuse themselves from both the discussion phase of the meeting as well as th e decision -making process for matters in which a potential conflict exists. Subject to FERPA, a ll deliberations, minutes, findings, and recommendations of the APPS Committee functions remain confidential except where the student waives confidentiality , or the release is required by law. All APPS Committee meeting minutes and evidence are maintained in the Office of the Dean . The APPS Committee Chair will notify the student in writing of the decision of the APPS Committee meeting as soon as practical. Upon receipt of notification, the student must sign and return the Notice of Decision within the timeframe defined in the letter. Policy on Student Response to CUSOM Request for Information Whenever this Academic Bulletin requires the student to provide a written response to be received by CUSOM on or before a certain date, CUSOM will not grant exceptions to the stated deadline except in the case of a medical emergency, and in that case, the student must provide the response as soon as medically feasible. If the APPS Committee renders a decision , which is considered appealable as delineated in Section 6.7.7.2 of this Bulletin, t he student shall have the right to submit a written appeal of the APPS Committee decision to the Dean within five (5) business day s of receipt of notification in accordance with Section 6.7. 8 of this Bulletin. Note: Students are not permitted to appeal sanctions denoted as \" Non- appealable\" as presented in Section 6.7.7.1 of this Bulletin. 242 6.7.2 Student Professionalism and Ethics Standards All CUSOM students are required to conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner at all times. Establishing and maintaining the highest concepts of honor and personal integrity during medical school is critical to the training of physicians. It is the responsibility of the st udent to support the highest standards of professionalism and student conduct including, but not limited to, those delineated in this Bulletin. This includes adherence to the policies and procedures of CUSOM in all matters. All CUSOM students have the rights and obligations of other citizens and measure the urgency of these obligations in the light of responsibilities to colleagues, to their profession, and to the institution. When CUSOM students speak or act as private citi zens, they must avoid creating the impression of speaking or acting for their School or the University. As such, they are prohibited from identify ing themselves as CUSOM students when expressing personal opinions in a public forum, posting comments or material on websites, social media, or other forms of communication without the express permission of the Dean. As citizens engaged in a profession which depends upon freedom for its health and integrity, students have a particular obligation to promote c onditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of academic freedom. Student Statement of Professional Ethics As a CUSOM student, I will... Be guided by a deep conviction of the worth and dignity of all human life; Pursue the advancement of knowl edge and recognize the special responsibiliti es placed upon me; Adhere to the policies and procedures of CUSOM in all matters; Seek and communicate truth; Promote scholarly competence and integrity; Practice intellectual honesty; Uphold scholarly and ethical standards; Demonstrate respect for peers, faculty, staff, administration and the community in general; Foster honest academic condu ct and ensure student evaluations reflect the student's true merit; Promote appropriate interaction between students and faculty, students and administ ration, and students and staff; Avoid any exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory treatment; Respect and defend the free inquiry of associates' exchange of ideas and show respect for the opinions of others; and Give due regard to the paramount responsibilities within the institution in determining the amount and character of work done outside it. 243 Respect for Patients CUSOM takes the utmost care to ensure patient respect and confidentiality. As osteopathic medical students, students must demonstrate respect for patients through the use of appropriate language and behavior, including that which is non-threatening and no n- judgmental. This respect extends to interactions with standardized patients, including simulated patients , during all OSCE, clinical skills, OMM, and simulation experiences/labs. In order to maintain professional relationships with patients and their families, patient privacy and modesty must be respected during history taking, physical examinations, and any other interactions . It is critical for students to be truthful and not intentionally mislead or give false information. Students should avoid disclosing information to a patient which only the patient's physician should reveal. Students should always, or at the request of the patient, consult more experienced members of the medical team regarding patient care. Respect for Faculty, Staff, Colleagues, Hospital Personnel, and Community Students must exhibit respect for faculty, staff, colleagues, and others, including hospital personnel, guests, and members of the general public. This respect should be demonstrated by punctuality in relationships with patients and peers, prompt execution of reasonable instructions, and deference to those with superior knowledge, experience or capabilities. Students should express views in a calm and respectful manner when in disagreement with another individual, understanding that a mutual agreement will not always be reached. Respect for Self All students must uphold a high level of personal ethics, beliefs, and morals in their daily conduct. Respect for Laws, Policies and Regulations Students must respect and obey the laws, policies, and regulations at all levels of the University and the local community, state , and federal government. 6.7.2.1 Informed Consent Policy Purpose Patients, research participants, and designated surrogates when appropriate, must be provided with appropriate information required for them to make informed choices and give informed consent. Faculty, staff, students, and researchers are responsible for ensuring that all personal health information of patients and research participant s remains confidential in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) . 244 All CUSOM faculty, staff, and students must practice within the informed consent framework as presented in this policy. Guiding Principles Patients have an ethical and legal right to be free of unwanted medical interventions and bodily invasions. Competent patients, by law, must be informed of the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the proposed care and have the right to reject a physician's recom mendations. This right to refuse also extends to noninvasive care, such as diagnostic tests and medications. Patients have a right to consent or decline their participation in medical education (including the presence of students or other observers durin g treatment or examination) or to take part in research. \"Observers\" (including students) are defined as individuals additional to the normal medical team and personnel immediately involved in a patient's acute or on -going care. Patients must not be incl uded in research without their written informed consent. Additional information regarding informed consent for research studies is provided by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Campbell University or the IRB of record for affiliated clinical sites. Specific information regarding Campbell University's IRB may be found at the Institutional Review Board website . Procedure General Principles Informed consent is the process whereby an individual who has the capacity/competence to consent to a medical evaluation and treatment, having been given sufficient information, arrives at a reasoned decision as to whether or not to agree to a proposed therapy or procedure. Consent may be given verbally or in writing so long as the details that are discussed are appropriately documented. Consent must be given in writing if: o The patient will be under general anesthesia; o There is a significant risk of adverse effects on the patient; o The procedure is experimental; o The patient is to participate in any research study; o The procedure is to be undertaken in the operating room setting; o When either party requests it; or o As required by specific healthcare system/facility policies. 245 Informed Consent is not only the act of completing documentation, but rather a process of exchange of information so that an informed decision can be made by the patient (or their legal surrogate) or research participant. The patient has the right to be accurately and adequately informed about any proposed procedure or treatment and to subsequently agree or refuse to proceed with the procedure or treatment discussed. All health professionals have a responsibili ty to inform patients about proposed procedures and treatments and to obtain informed consent to procedures and treatment plans. Due to the potential lack of familiarity of treatment details, potential adverse outcomes, and alternatives to treatment, medic al students are NOT permitted to obtain informed written consent for diagnostic studies, treatment, or procedures being performed by other physicians or health care providers. In the event of a discrepancy between the CUSOM policy and the policy of the te aching site, this CUSOM policy supersedes the teaching site where written consent obtained by a student is concerned. Generally, informed consent must be obtained for each treatment or procedure proposed (e.g., anesthesia and surgery are separate procedure s). There are, however, situations where consent for each individual treatment or procedure would be inappropriate. (See below section regarding Composite Procedures). Consent in Emergency Situations o Consent may not be available in emergencies when the capacity to consent is impaired or absent. o Key features of an emergency include a medical condition of extreme urgency, which, if left untreated, may result in serious consequences including significant morbidity or mortality. o In these situations, health ca re providers may operate under the principle of implied consent, which is founded on the notion that reasonable persons would consent to treatment in such emergency circumstances. o When providing treatment in the situation of implied consent, treatment prov ided should generally be limited to that which is necessary to stabilize an d treat the emergent condition. o After the emergency has been stabilized, and the patient has the capacity to consent, the patient must be provided information regarding any treatmen t or procedures that were utilized in their care. 246 Information that Should be Provided When Obtaining Informed Consent The higher the probability of risk, or the greater the magnitude of harm associated with a treatment plan or procedure, the more care and detail is required when providing the patient information. Every patient has the right to receive: o An explanation of their condition; o An explanation of the treatment options available, including any alternatives, and an assessment of the expected ris ks, side effects, benefits, and costs of each option; o Advice as to the estimated time within which the services will or should be provided; o Any other information required by legal, professional, ethical, and other relevant standards; o The results of any dia gnostic tests; o The results and outcomes of procedures; and/or o An explanation of any complications that may occur during a procedure or treatment. Every patient has the right to receive honest and accurate answers to questions relating to diagnostic and tre atment services, including: o The identity and the qualifications of the provider(s) who will be rendering care o The recommendation of the provider(s) o How to obtain an opinion from another provider o The results of research related to the procedure Every pati ent has the right to receive, on request, a written summary of information provided. Patient Right to Refuse Treatment It should be made clear to the patient or research study participant that he or she has the right to refuse or withdraw from any treatment without fear of recrimination or penalty. Advance Directives Every patient may use an advanced directive to consent to or refuse a health care treatment or procedure. An advanced directive is the patient's instructions to consent to or to refuse treatment, given at a time when the patient was competent, for use when they are subsequently of diminished competency. An advanced directive must be written and notarized to be considered a legal document. 247 There may be language in the advanced dir ective that specifies the healthcare power of attorney's ability to change the content in select circumstances, or that specifies the content of the advanced directive is not to be altered in any event. Composite Procedures Composite Procedures, or inter dependent treatments, are those where the treatments are routine and necessarily interdependent, for example, administration of general anesthetic, endotracheal intubation and the insertion of intra - vascular lines accompanying major surgical procedures (bu t not the surgery itself). In such cases, all the component procedures should be clearly described to the patient as an integral part of the treatment for which she/he is consenting. Appropriate further action may be consented to by a patient in the event of potential pathology being confirmed during the procedure for which they actually consented. o For example, the surgeon may proceed to a more extensive operation following a biopsy that is confirmed as malignancy during frozen section analysis. o The patien t should be informed as to the possible nature of the additional surgery, and the consequences of non - consent; for example, the need for further surgery. o If the patient is unable to make an informed decision without a confirmed diagnosis, consent to a comp osite procedure should not be sought. Composite procedures should never be used to imply prior consent to treatment or procedures, which are not routinely used in the treatment for which the patient has consented, and/or are unproven in the situation, even in an emergency. In the event unforeseen pathology is discovered during the procedure for which the patient actually consented, the physician should not perform a definitive procedure for that pathology during that procedure. It is preferable that the new diagnosis be considered separately and separate consent to treatment gained from the patient. Concerning Procedures without Consent Provisions for overriding the individual's right to decide whether or not to consent to treatment, including some procedu res, exist in limited circumstances in cases where that right is seen to work against the public good. The following are examples: o A patient may be urgently sedated, by injection if necessary, without their consent when the medical 248 practitioner has reaso nable grounds to believe it is necessary to maintain that person's or another person's safety. o In the instance of tuberculosis, North Carolina law permits quarantine or isolation under certain circumstances as set forth in North Carolina General Statute Se c. 130A -145. o Coroners have the ability to require post -mortem exams, which the deceased's family has no right to refuse. o The court has the ability to appoint a welfare guardian to make decisions on behalf of a person who lacks capacity to make or communica te decisions about any particular aspect or aspects of that person's personal care and welfare - including medical and surgical procedures. o The use of \"such force as may be reasonably necessary\" is allowed in the circumstance to prevent the commission of suicide, or of an offense likely to cause immediate and serious injury to the person or property of anyone. This includes the application of chemical or physical restraint without consent in the circumstances specified in the section. Informed Consent of Minors Consent to treat patients under the age of 18 years must be obtained from the parent(s) or legal guardian(s), except in cases when the patient has been declared a legally emancipated minor. In order for parents to provide informed consent, they must be provided all the information normally required to obtain consent from an adult. In addition to obtaining parental consent, information should, where practical, be given to the minor in a way that the minor can understand and, where possible, the chil d's agreement should also be sought. Even when children are not capable of giving informed consent, their assent to interventions is still ethically important if it is developmentally appropriate. Some state laws may allow minors to consent to specific services such as care for pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Students, physicians, and other healthcare providers must be familiar with the state laws in which they are practicing and know how to reference them when required. Reference to the state laws where the student is rotating is recommended. The presumption of parental decision making provides that parents, after being provided with all information needed to make an informed decision, have the right to refuse treatments, procedures, and testing for their child even when it is recommended by the treating physician. 249 However, courts have ruled that parents do not have absolute power to refuse care for their children. For example, when parents cannot be persuaded to accept life -saving thera py that has few side effects, such as antibiotics for bacterial meningitis in a previously healthy child, physicians may ask the courts to override parental decisions. Blood and Blood Products In the case in which treatment would include the administrati on of blood or blood products, the patient must receive adequate information regarding the reasons for the transfusion, the risks, the anticipated benefits, and potential adverse sequelae. In addition, they must receive the same information regarding pote ntial outcomes of not proceeding with a transfusion. In circumstances where the patient cannot give informed consent (e.g., under anesthesia) blood products may be given if deemed to be in the patient's best interest, unless there is clear knowledge that t he patient would not agree. As a general rule, when consent is being obtained for anesthesia, consent would also be obtained for the use of blood products if, in the particular circumstances, there is a significant risk (1% or more) of these products being required. When blood or blood products are refused by an adult for any reason (e.g., religious beliefs), this decision must be respected, ensuring that those making the decision fully understand the implications this may have on the clinical outcome. Consent for Photography, Video, or Audio Recordings Making a recording of any patient without obtaining written informed consent is not permitted. Clinical Case Recordings - The recordings must be used purely for patient management and must be included as pa rt of the patient's confidential medical record and protected according to HIPAA requirements. In the case of a patient who is incapable of consenting personally, consent must be obtained from that patient's surrogate/representative. No patient who has dec lined consent may be included in a recording. Where staff or relatives are to be included in the recordings, their written consent must also be obtained. Where recordings are to be used for reproduction in a journal or textbook, inclusion in a display pres entation or any other form of publication, or distributed or transmitted by electronic 250 or digital media, written consent detailing the use of material is required. Recordings are to be identified by the patient's hospital number or other tracking number, rather than by use of the patient's name. There shall be no information on any recording which specifically identifies the patient by name. Recording for Research or Educational Purposes A consent to be recorded for research or educational purposes is ineffective and invalid unless it is given following a disclosure of all the relevant information surrounding the recording, including: o Who is to make the recording; o Why the recording is being made; o The audience for whom it is to be made and used; and o How, and for how long, the recording will be stored. These matters must be specified in the written consent obtained. The patient must not be subject to any pressure to give consent. No recordings may be used for any purpose other than the purpose or purposes specified in the consents obtained. Ethical Guidelines for the Involvement of Patients in Clinical Teaching and Research Any research involving patients must have appropriate mechanisms in place for identifying patients and gaining informed consent from each involved person. A healthcare provider CANNOT give participation consent on behalf of a group of individual patients. Individual consent must be obtained in all instances. In the partnership between patient, teaching and research staff, and student, the paramount consideration must always be the welfare and interests of the patient. These guidelines apply to all teaching staff, other qualified staff, and students working in all settings where patient/student interactions are organized primarily for te aching and research purposes. The quality of patient care is the responsibility of the clinical team. Students participating in aspects of the clinical treatment are supervised by their clinical team and supported by the teaching staff. Physical examinati on or specific procedures undertaken by students must not be repeated unreasonably on any one patient and must not produce or prolong any distress, embarrassment or pain. 251 Students involved in research activities must have received authorization to partici pate and do so under supervision of the teaching staff. Campbell University Institutional Review Board (IRB) Policies and Procedures governing research safety, regulation compliance, scientific quality, and ethical standards are found on the Institutional Review Board Policies and Procedures website . Campbell University IRB Policies regarding student Participation in research are found on the Institutional Review Board Studen t Research website . Medical Education Consent Every patient has the right to decide whether he or she wishes to agree to an interview, examination or other specific procedure carried out by a student. Every patient has the right to withdraw from a teachi ng session or research project at any stage and must receive a clear prior assurance that refusal to participate in teaching and research or withdrawing from teaching and research will not jeopardize his or her care in any way. Students must seek the agree ment of patients to be interviewed and examined, or to be the subject of specific learning procedures, and must explain clearly what is involved. Written consent must be obtained from the patient by the treating physician or health care provider for a stud ent to undertake any procedure or examination to be performed by them while the patient is under general anesthesia or sedation. The patient's verbal consent must be obtained for learners to observe procedures in surgical suites if they are part of the car e giving team. The consent should be obtained before pre - medication is given. Patients have the right to know the name and professional status of any person who wishes to interview them for teaching or research purposes and/or examine them, or to carry out specific treatment or investigation procedures. Clinical educators must ask a patient's permission to involve him or her in group teaching or clinical demonstration sessions and explain precisely what will be involved and how many students will be pres ent. 252 Consequences of Non -Compliance Instances of potential non -compliance with the Informed Consent Policy are of serious concern and any allegation of such will be investigated and adjudicated according to the process delineated in the CUSOM DO Academic Bulletin. Due to the sensitive nature of the grievance, CUSOM will require that all real and standardized patient interactions with the accused be immediately suspended at the time of the grievance, pending the investigation conclusion. As outlin ed in the CUSOM DO Academic Bulletin, the APPS Committee is responsible for the review of situations involving academic misconduct or violations of CUSOM's Honor Code, Code of Conduct, or Professionalism standards. 6.7.2. 2 Chaperoned Physical Exam Policy Purpose The purpose of this policy is to define the need for, and usage of, chaperones in patient care, simulation, and teaching environments of Campbell University and its affiliated sites. Patient/learner trust cannot be maintained without a basic understanding of the limits and responsibilities of the professional's role. The valued human experience of the physician -patient relationship is damaged when there is either confusion regarding professional roles and behavior or clear lack of integrity t hat allows sexual exploitation and harm. Sexual impropriety may comprise behavior, gestures, or expressions that are seductive, sexually suggestive, disrespectful of patient privacy, or sexually demeaning to a patient, that may include, but are not limite d to: 1. Neglecting to employ appropriate disrobing or draping practices respecting the patient's privacy, or deliberately watching a patient dress or undress ; 2. Subjecting a patient to an intimate examination in the presence of medi cal students or other parties without the p atient's informed consent or in the event such info rmed consent has b een withd rawn; 3. Examination or touching of genital muco sal areas without the use of gloves; 4. Inapp ropriate comments about or to the patient, including but not limited to, making s exual comments about a patient's body or underclothing, making s exualized or sexually demeaning comments to a patient, critici zing the p atient's sexual 253 orientation, or making comments about potential sexual performance during an examination; 5. Using the physician-patient relationship to solicit a date or romantic relationship; 6. Initiation by the physician of conversation regarding the sexual probl ems, pr eferences, or fantasi es of the physician; 7. Performi ng an intimate examination or consultation without clinical justification; 8. Performi ng an intimate examination or consultat ion without explaining to the p atient the need for such examination or consultation even when the examination or consultation is pertinent to the issue of sexual function or dysfunction; and/or 9. Requesting details of sexual history or sexual likes or dislikes when not clinically indicated for the type of examination or consultation. Policy Medical students at any level of training are held to the same ethical standards as established by the medical profession. Efforts to provide a comfortable and considerate atmosphere for the patient and t he learner are part of respecting patients' dignity. These efforts may include, but are not limited to, providing appropriate gowns, private facil ities for undressing, sensitive use of draping, and clearly explaining various components of the physica l examination. Having chaperones present during the physical exam can also help prevent misunderstandings between patient and learner or health care provider. CUSOM s tudents and faculty must comply with the following requirements : 1. Adhere to a policy that patients are free to request a chaperone during the medi cal encounter and ensure that the policy is clearly communicated to patients. 2. Always honor a patient's request to have a chaperone. 3. Never perform invasive or sensitive exams such as breast, pelvic, rectal, and genitourin ary exams without the p resence of an authori zed chaperone. 4. Have an authori zed memb er of the health care team serve as a chaperone. Physicians should establi sh clear expectations that chaperones will uphold pro fessional standards of privacy and confid entiality. 5. Use a chaperone even when a patient's trusted companion or family memb er is pr esent. 254 6. Provide oppo rtunity for private conversation with the patient without the chaperone present. Physicians should minimize inquiries or history taki ng of a sensitive n ature during a chaperoned examination. 7. Have chaperones available regardless of the physician's gender. 8. Inform the patient that an appropriate staff member can act as a chaperone if required and where possible this will be a staff member of the same gender as the patient. 9. Respect that the patient has the right, at all times, to decline a particular p erson as chaperone. 10. Utilize the learning or simulation environme nt in a mann er consistent with r especting patient pri vacy. 11. Utilize same gender models for sensitive physical exam demonstr ations wh enever possible (cardiac exam, sa cral exam, etc...). 12. Perform Osteopathic Manual Manipulation (OMM) only on subjects or patients who are adequately clothed to cov er all sensitive areas. 13. Not p erform OMM as an invasive procedure. 14. Respect the right of a patient participating in an educational activity (such as, but not limited to OMM lab, ultrasound lab, clinical skills) to refuse any component of the physical exam. 15. Respect the right of a child volun teer in the OMM or Clinical Skills lab to refuse any component of a physical exam, even if approval to perform the exam has been given by the parent. Children participating in OMM or Cl inical Skills labs must never be forcefully subjected to any physical exam, even if the exam is not consid ered sensitive in n ature. Family members or friends of the patient should not be expected to undertake any formal chaperone role. There is a risk of inadvertent breaches of confidentiality and embarrassment if friends or relatives are chaperones, and they are best avoided unless there is no alternative than postp oning an immediately necessary physical examination. There is also the possibility of collusion between the patient and friend/relative/caregiver to conspire where any complaint of abuse is made. Medical students must not conduct any intimate examination unsupervised even if the patient provides permission for them to proceed with the examination without a chaperone. Medical students cannot act as a chaperone to their clinical partner (another medical student) or another health care provider for intimate examinations. 255 It is important that students seek verbal consent from patients for any form of examination. For intimate examinations, informed consent is particularly important. Intimate examinations include the following : vaginal examination; rectal examination; external genitalia examination; breast examination; and any other examination that might embarrass patients throu gh the removal of clothes, particularly those examinations that might expose external genitalia or breasts. Procedure Communicate the chaperone protocol to patients by prominent notice through conversation with the patient. In addition, all healthcare providers and students must adhere to the following principles: Honor all requests for a chaperone. Utilize private facilities for undressing, incorporate sensitive use of draping, and provide clear explanations on the various components of the physical examination to be performed. o The nature of the procedure/examination should be explain ed o The purpose of the procedure/examination should be clearly stated, (e.g. \"it is to help me learn how to...\") o There should be an explanation, where relevant, of what will happen to the information collected (e.g., \"I will record my findin gs in the medi cal notes... \") o The patient's understanding , and acceptance , of the procedure/ examination should be assessed and documented Utilize chaperones on a consistent b asis, particularly for intimate examinations and those that may be constr ued as such regardless of physician or learner's gender. When a chaperone is present, keep patient inquiries of a sensitive nature to a minimum. Provide a separate oppo rtunity for a private conversation between the patient and the physician, in order to protect the patient's p ersonal health info rmation (PHI). Provide an authori zed healthcare professional to s erve as the chaperone wh enever possibl e. During a rectal/vaginal examination, sur gical gloves mu st be worn. Glov es act as a barrier and thus help to maintain the clinical natu re of the exam. Throughout the examination, the healthcare professional must remain alert to verbal and no n-verbal indications of dis tress from the p atient. Any request for the examination to be discontinu ed should be respected and do cument ed in the patient's records. 256 Any discussion during the examination should be kept relevant avoiding any unnecessary personal comments regardless of whether a chaperone is pr esent. A person who is feeling embarrassed or vulne rable is more likely to misinterpret a comment. Document in the patient no te or chart the presence of a chaperone with a ny intimate examination or those that m ay be constr ued as such. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) offers the following additional guidance on the use of chaperones for children and adoles cents: In the medic al office setting, the physical examination of an infant, toddler, or child should always be performed in the presence of a parent or guardian. If a parent or guardian is unavailable or the parent's presence will interfere with the p hysical examination, such as in a possible case of abuse or p arental ment al health issues, a chaperone sho uld be present during the p hysical examination. Cons equences of Non-compliance Items of potential non -compliance are of serious concern and will require confirmation via investigation of any allegation. Due to the sensitive nature of the grievance, CUSOM will require that all real and standardized patient interactions involving the accused be immediately suspended at the time of the grievance, pending the investigation co nclusion. As outlined in this Academic Bulletin, the APPS Committee is responsible for the review of situations where students are involved in academic misconduct, or unprofessional conduct. The CUSOM Honor Code will guide this review. Outcomes of an APPS Committee intervention may include, but are not limited to , any of the following levels of discipline: Conduct Probation; Suspension; Dismissal from the program without the option to return; or Revocation of Degree Violations of patient rights are serious matte rs and may result in civil and crimin al charges. FERPA privacy laws do not prot ect violations of a crimin al natu re. 257 6.7.3 Honor Code The Campbell University Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine Honor Code (CUSOM Honor Code) embodies a spirit of mutual trust, intellectual honesty, and professionalism between the School and the student body, and it is the highest expression of the values shared by the CUSOM and Campbell University communities. The CUSOM Honor Code is based on the fundamental belief that every student is worthy of trust , and it is maintained to protect the right to participate in an academic environment free from injustice caused by dishonesty. Further, CUSOM students are expected to conduct themsel ves in a professional and ethical manner befitting the honorable profession they are entering. Students have an obligation to maintain the highest standards of honesty and integrity. It is not possible to enumerate all examples of expected academic and professional behavior, nor is it possible to enumerate all behaviors considered inappropriate, unprofessional, unethical, or not in keeping with the conduct standards of a CUSOM student. In general, the founding principles of the CUSOM Honor Code are the established rules and regulations of the CUSOM community. The CUSOM community includes CUSOM, affiliated hospitals, and any institution (\"Affiliated Sites\") where CUSOM students pursue activities for academic credit. Violation of the policies, rules , and regulations of these Affiliated Sites may constitute a violation of the CUSOM Honor Code. In addition, specific examples of behavior which may constitute a violation of the CUSOM Honor Code include, but are not limited to, the following: Cheating: Providin g, acquiring, or receiving any unauthori zed assistance or unfair advantage on any form of academic work, or attempt thereof. Sharing inf ormation f rom testing/exams is also conside red a form of cheating. Plagiarism: Copying the language, structure, ideas, algorithms, or compu ter code of another and representing it as one's own work on any form of academic work or attempt thereof. Falsification: Fabrication of in formation on any form of academic work or attempt the reof, including, but not limited to, the followin g: o Clinical requirements; o Externships and clinical rotations ; o Assignments such as: ob taining patient histories, performi ng physical exams, ord ering or int erpreting laboratory tests, documenting and submi tting rotation records, etc...; o CUSOM lab, skills workshop, small group session, and clinical rotation attendance reports ; or o Clinical preceptor or other faculty evaluation or grading forms . 258 Unprofessional or unethical behavior: Behavior on or off the CUSOM campus that would or could cause a loss of respect or confidence in the offending student or in the CUSOM community by the public, faculty, staff, colleagues, or the-community-at-large. Unprofessional or unethical behavior may include, but is not limited to, the following: o Entering or using the facilities of the CUS OM community without appropriate authori zation or during inappropriate times; o Knowingly and purposely disrupt ing teaching, research, administrative, or student fun ctions of the CUSOM community; o Abusive or disrespectful condu ct toward members of the faculty, administrative or pro fessional staff, employees, students, patients, or vis itors of the CUSOM commun ity. Medical simulators must be treated with the same level of respect and professionalism as standardized or actual patients ; o Disclosure of privil eged information from campus activities or patient care; o Taking pictures or recording video in the anatomy lab, clinical lab, OSCE rooms, or in any ro oms housing clinical simulators; o Impro per relationships or activities involving persons entrusted to a student as part of educational requirements, which extend beyond those educational requirements. Entrusted persons may inclu de, but are not limited to, patients or oth er stud ents und er supervisio n; o Breach of Integrity: Any behavior at any time that is consid ered a severe lapse in judgment and has the potential to damage the pro fessional, ethical or moral integrity of the CUSOM community; or o A violation of any policy of the Univ ersity or CUSOM, including but not l imited to the American Osteopathic Asso ciation Code of Ethics. 6.7.3.1 Professional Standing Professional Standing is defined as a student's professional status at any time within the four -year CUSOM curriculum . A student is considered in Good Professional Standing if they are not currently on Conduct Probation. A student is Not in Good Professional Standing if they are currently on Conduct Probation. Professional Standing is used , part, in determining eligibility for students to participate in CUSOM approved activit ies, such as conferences, student organizations, etc. Professional Standing and 259 GPA requirements for student eligibility to serve as an SGA or club officer, participate in CUSOM -sponsored research, serve on a CUSOM Committee, and receive an approved absen ce to attend any off-campus conference or meeting are delineated in Secti ons 6.4.2, 6.4.3.4, and 7.3.1 o f this Bulletin. CUSOM must attest to the NBOME that each CUSOM student is in Good Academic and Professional Standing prior to sitting for COMLEX -USA L evel 1 and COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE. As such, a student Not in Good Academic and Professional Standing with not be approved to sit for COMLEX. 6.7.3.2 Conduct Warning The APPS Committee may place a student on Conduct Warning for a defined term if the student violates the CUSOM Honor Code or Code of Conduct . The APPS Committee reviews the record of each student on Conduct Warning at the end of the defined term to evaluate the student's professional progress and makes recommendations regarding the continuation or removal of Conduct Warning. Conduct Warning will not appear on the student's official transcript and will not be included in the Medical Student Perfo rmance Evaluation (MSPE). Student s on Conduct Warning are not eligible to serve as a Student Government, club or organization officer, serve on a CUSOM committee, receive an approved absence to attend an off -campus conference or meeting, serve as a Teaching Assistant, or participate in CUSOM -sponsored research, such as the Sum mer Research Scholars program. 6.7.3.3 Conduct Probation The APPS Committee may place a student on Conduct Probation for a defined term if the student violates the CUSOM Honor Code or Code of Conduct . The APPS Committee reviews the record of each student on Conduct Probation at the end of the defined term to evaluate the student's professional progress and makes recommendations regarding the continuation or removal of Conduct Probation. Conduct Probation will not appear on the student's official transcript . Conduct Probation will be included in the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE) , and state licensing boards where required . 260 Student s on Conduct Probation are not eligible to serve as a Student Government, club or organization officer, serve on a CUSOM committee, receive an approved absence to attend an off -campus conference/meeting, serve as a Teaching Assistant, or participate in CUSOM -sponsored research, such as the Sum mer Research Scholars program. Conduct Probation is a more significant sanction than Conduct Warning, and any additional professionalism issues, which arise while on Conduct Probation, may result in Dismissal fr om the program. Section 6.7.5 of this Bulletin , \"Procedures for Calling and Conducting an APPS Committee Meeting Regarding Non -Academic Matters\", describes the process for addressing cases related to allegations of misconduct , professionalism , or Honor Code violations. 6.7.4 Code of Conduct Violations may includ e, but are not limited to: Harassment (other than a violation of the Title IX Policy), harm, abuse, or damage to any person or property in the CUSOM community. This includ es know ingly or purp osely causing damage to or v andalizing CUSOM community proper ty; Arrest for a crimin al offense other than a minor traffic offense; Participating in academic or clinical endeavors in the CUSOM community while und er the influ ence of alcohol, or controll ed substances; Use, possession, or distribution of illicit subst ances, prescription medications withou t a valid prescription, or substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolina may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismiss al. Controll ed substances will be viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal substances. Please note this includ es substances which are illegal in the state of North Ca rolina, but which m ay be legal in other states; Controlled substance screening tests which show abnormalities including, but not limited to, excessively dilute urine, or screening tests which are positive (i.e., evidence of the substance or showing presence) for alcohol, prescription medications without a valid pr escription, or substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolina. Controlled substance screening results are viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal substances. For example, although the use of marijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to patients; o As such, the use of marijuana in any form is a violation of University policy. 261 o Anoth er example is a br eathalyzer result or a blood alcohol concentration sample identi fying lev els of alcohol above the legal limit in violation of law, such as in a Driving Und er the Influence (DUI), Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), or a similar charge. o The presence of these subs tances, regardless of any legal consid erations or adjud ication by the courts, is or u nethical behavior by CUSOM . Com municating or posting of information or images in a public arena, including w ritten or electroni c/Internet communications, which could result in a loss of respect by patients or other memb ers of the public toward the offending student or tow ard CUSO M. Disruptive Behavior: Any inapp ropriate etiquette or inapp ropriate disturbance either solely or repeated often enough oft en enough to establi sh a disrespectful trend. Inappropriate disturbances include but are not limited to the following: o Arriving late for class, lab, or clinical rotations; o Disrupting class with cellular phon es; o Disrupting class with c omputers or compu ter games; o Disrupting class with loud talking or other activities which create a distraction; o Leaving trash in classrooms or academic areas, including student small group study room s; o Bringing food into unauthori zed areas or hosting food functions without p ermissio n; o Posting un approved materials or approved mat erials in inapp ropriate areas; or o Parking in inappropriate or reserved spaces. Unacceptable use of technology: Unacceptable uses of te chnolo gy include, but are not limited to, the following: o Using compu ters for p urposes which are consid ered unprofessional or i mmoral; o Accessing pornographic material at any time while on any campus of the CUSOM community or using any equipment of the CUSOM community to access such material; o Distributing, posting, or uploading materials to students or any other third party not authorized to receive them or to those outside CUSOM is an Honor Code violation. Lecture materials, includi ng PowerPoint presentations, and videos contain confid ential and proprietary info rmation and material protected by intellectual p roperty laws. Students do not h ave permission to share them.; or o Any device capable of capturing still or video images or audio recordings, including cell phones, are not permitted in any laboratory (anatomy, clinical skills, OMM, Simulation), or in any clinical setting, including but not limited to OSCE, standardized p atients, simulation activities, clinical rotations, and the student health clinic. 262 6.7.5 Procedures for Calling and Conducting an APPS Committee Meeting Regarding Non -Academic Matters Reasons for an APPS/ ad hoc Committee hearing/meeting for non -academic matters include, but are not limited to, allegations that the student has : Violated the CUSOM Honor Code or Co de of Conduct; Violat ed any CUSOM or Campbell Unive rsity policy/procedure or provision of this Bulletin; Failed a controlled substance screening test; Failed to maintain required vaccinations as scheduled; Received findings on a criminal background check that would affect the student's matriculation or potential ability to participate in clinical rotation s; Failed to adhere to established timelines/due dates; Failed to update contact information; or Failed to respond in timely manner to email and other forms of communication from CUSOM. Allegations of misconduct may arise from an individual student, group of students, faculty m ember, clinical preceptor, staff member, or member of the community. For issues arising from Honor Code, Code of Conduct, or professionalis m or ethics violations, the person(s) identifying the issue(s) should report the issue(s) to the Office of Student A ffairs or the respective Associate Dean (Biomedical or Clinical) within five (5) business days of the issue(s) or becoming aware of the issue(s) . The Office of Student Affairs or respective Associate Dean will collect documentation which may be relevant to the alleged violation. This may include, but is not limited to, a written report from the student(s), faculty, or staff involved with the incident(s). In the case where stu dents are reporting the suspected violation, unless required at a hearing, not waived by the subject(s) of the alleged violation, or required by law, confidentiality of the reporting student is maintained to the maximum extent possible , and the Office of S tudent Affairs or respective Associate Dean will present the reporting student(s)'s testimony. Dated notes are typically taken to des cribe the discussion. The Office of Student Affairs or respective Associate Dean notifies the Associate Dean for Clinical Integration of the suspected misconduct or violation and provides him/her with a detailed summary of the reason for referral along with all supporting documentation. The Associate Dean for Clinical Integration then, (i) constitutes an ad hoc committee to investigate the suspected misconduct, who reports their findings in writing to the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, or (ii) depending upon the severity of the allegations, refers the matter directly to the APPS Committee. 263 If forwarded to the APPS Committee pursuant to Section 6.7.6, the recommendations of the ad hoc committee or the decision of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs are presented to the APPS Committee at the hearing. The student( s) shall meet with the APPS Com mittee and be informed of the allegations and afforded an opportunity to explain themselves and offer any mitigating factors. All sessions of the Committee are closed to all individuals except those immediately concerned in the case. APPS Committee meeti ngs are not considered legal hearings, therefore neither attorneys nor other representatives (e.g., healthcare providers) are allowed to attend. Faculty Recusal from APPS Committee Hearings Per the CUSOM Faculty Recusal Policy (Section 6.2.2 of this Bulletin), a ny CUSOM faculty member who is a healthcare professional with a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship with a CUSOM student, in any CUSOM program, must recuse themselves from all activities involving the summative assessment, grading, and promotion of that student. In the case of committee meetings, including, but not limited to, the Academic Performance, Progress and Standards (APPS) Committee, the committee Chair (or designee) will call for a declaration of any conflict of interest, from committee members prior to student case discussions. Any APPS Committee member(s) identifying a potential conflict, including a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship with a student, will be required to recuse themselves and exit the meeting until that student's case is concluded . APPS Committee Proceedings All persons present at the proceedings shall be bound to disclose no more than the Committee does in its official report on the case. The testimony of each witness is provided while the other witnesses in the case are out of the room. The Committee may allow introduction of evidence other than testimony of witnesses (for example, documentary evidence) provided the evidence is relevant to the question before the Committee on any matter. The Committee shall set rules for the conduct of all cases and all arrangements connected with collecting evidence. Timeframes for investigation of hearings and proceedings may be altered if circumstances warrant. The Committee will not accept or consider an y additional evidence from the student, or on behalf of the student, after the student has exited the Committee meeting except where the information (a) was not available at the time of the meeting and before deliberation, or (b) is deemed relevant by the committee during deliberation. 264 Deliberation of either the ad hoc Committee or the APPS Committee shall take place in private and remain confidential, and the standard for a decision in a hearing involving misconduct or honor code violations shall be based on a preponderance of the evidence (whether a violation is more likely than not to have occurred). All APPS Committee meeting minutes and evidence are maintained in the Office of the Dean. The APPS Committee Chair will notify the student , in writing , of the decision of the APPS Committee meeting as soon as practical. Upon receipt of notification, the student must sign and return the Notice of Decision within the timeframe defined in the letter . If the APPS committee renders a decision that is considered appealable as delineated in Section 6.7.7.2 of this Bulletin, t he student shall have the right to submit a written appeal of the APPS Committee decision to the Dean within five (5) business days of receipt of notification in accordance with Section 6.7.8 of this Bulletin 6.7.5.1 Rights of the Student With respect to a hearing regarding non-academic matters , the student(s) is guaranteed the right to: a timely hearing, if requested ; receive notice of the allegation(s) at least three (3) days prior to the hearing ; a presumption of innocence until found guilty based on a preponderance of the evidence (whether a violation is more likely than not to have occurred) ; solicit advice ; expect the case to be adjudicated in a confidential manner ; and appeal the decision to the Dean in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.7.8 of this Bulletin. Note: students are not permitted to appeal sanctions denoted as \"Non-appealable\" as presented in Section 6.7.7.1 of this Bulletin . 6.7.6 Ad hoc Committee Procedures If referred to an ad hoc Committee, the Chair of the ad hoc Committee will schedule a hearing with the ad hoc Committee and notify the accused student(s) (the \"Respondent\") at least three (3) business days prior to the hearing. This hearing typically is held as soon as practical following the referral of the case to the ad hoc Committee. 265 The Respondent(s) shall meet with the ad hoc Committee and be informed of the allegations and afforded an opportunity to explain themselves and offer any mitigating factors. Although the hearing's purpose is fact -finding, the Respondent(s) shall have the right to offer witnesses to support their position. The ad hoc Committee will not accept or consider any additional information from the student, or on behalf of the student, after the student has exited the ad hoc Committee meeting. All sessions of the ad hoc Committee are closed to all individuals except those immed iately concerned in the case. No legal counsel shall be present, as this is not a legal proceeding. All persons present at the proceedings shall be bound to disclose no more than the Committee does in its official report on the case. The testimony of ea ch witness is conducted in private while the other witnesses in the case are out of the room. Ad hoc Committee Decisions and Recommendations After the ad hoc Committee concludes its investigation, they shall provide a written report to the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs in a timely manner, which shall include a recommended finding of facts, and if the finding of facts is that a violation occurred, a recommended sanction. If the recommendation is that: 1. No violation oc curred, the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs may accept the finding, and so notify the Respondents(s); 2. No violation occurred, and the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs disagrees, he/she may decide: a) Upon an appropriate sanction as set forth below and so notify t he Respondents(s); or b) To forward the matter to the APPS Committee for further consideration; 3. A violation occurred, and the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs may accept the finding and the sanction proposed by the ad hoc Committee, and so notify the Respondents(s); 4. A violation occurred, and the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs disagrees with the sanction proposed by the ad hoc Committee, he/she may decide: a) Upon an appropriate sanction as set forth below, and so notify the Respondents(s); or b) To forward t he matter to the APPS Committee for further consideration on the sanction only. The Vice Dean for Academic Affairs notifies the student in writing of his/her decision and if the decision of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs is: 1. No. 2a, 3, or 4a above and the Respondents(s) accepts the decision, the decision of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs shall be final; or 266 2. No. 2a, 3, or 4a above, and Respondent(s) do not accept the decision of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, the Respondent(s) has/have th e right to appeal the decision to the APPS Committee *; or 3. No. 2b, or 4b above, the matter will be forwarded to the APPS Committee for further consideration. *Note: Students are not permitted to appeal sanctions denoted as \"Non-appealable\" as presented in Section 6.7.7.1 of this Bulletin . An appeal of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs' decision to the APPS Committee by the student must be made in writing to the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs within five (5) business days of receipt of notification and be based only upon new and relevant information not available to the student at the time of the hearing. If the student does not appeal within five (5) business days of receipt of notification, the Vice Dean's decision is final. 6.7.7 APPS Committee Sanctions Penalties or sanctions for violation of institutional policies or rules and regulations may be administered regardless of whether the actions of the student also constitute civil or criminal violations. Whenever disciplinary actions lead to the student leaving CUSOM, grades are assigned in accordance with the CUSOM grading policy. All APPS Committee meeting minutes and evidence are maintained in the Office of the Dean. Depending on the nature of the hearing, the following is a non -exclusive li st of sanctions the APPS Committee may recommend to the Dean or require to be imposed . 6.7.7.1. Non-appealable APPS Committee Sanctions The APPS Committee may impose a sanction, which is not appealable to the Dean, for students failing to make academic progress due to the following: Failure of one or more courses in any one Block in Years 1 and 2 of the curriculum; Failure of one or more total clinical rotations; Failure of any course or clinical rotation while in a Modified Course of Study; Failure of any course or clinical rotation while on Academic Probation; Failure to successfully remediate a failed course or clinical rotation is considered an additional course/rotation failure; 267 Failure to successfully complete any curricular requirements; or Any other issues similar to the foregoing and deemed relevant. In addition to imposing sanctions for failure to make academic progress, the Committee may review student progress in order to remove students from Academic Warning, Academic Probation, or Suspension. A non-appealable APPS Committee , ad hoc Committee**, or the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs** sanction may include, but is not limited to , any of the following decision by the APPS Committee : ** Ad hoc Committee and Vice Dean for Academic Affairs sanctions on ly address non -academic matters Award a satisfactory grade (C*, P*, or PC*) and promotion to the next Block/clinical rotation following satisfactory remediation; Require remediation, further coursework, repeat of courses, or write a topic -specific paper **; Repeat an examination, or coursework; Require the student to repeat multiple courses in which the student initially earned a failing grade; Specify a timeline or manner in which any remediation or Modified Schedule must occur; Require the successful completion of one or more additional clinical rotations and associated requirements, including, but not limited to, educational modules, procedure logs, and end-of-rotation exams (even if previously taken and passed); Place a student on a defined term of Academic Warning or Academic Probation.

An Admonition will not become a part of the student's longitudinal record and is not reported in the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). In certain circumstances, the APPS Committee Chair may determine a referral to the Committee warrants an Admonition and may directly assign that sanction if the student agrees to waive their meeting with the APPS Committee **; Assign an Academic Warning : A student who fail s any course or clinical rotation will be placed on Academic Warning for a defined term. While on Academic Warning, a student is not eligible to serve as a Student Government , club or organization officer, serve on a CUSOM committee, receive an approved absence to attend an off -campus conference or meeting, serve as a Teaching Assistant , or participate in CUSOM -sponsored research, such as the Summer Research Scholars program. The record of each student on Academic Warning is reviewed at the end of the defined term to evaluate the student's academic progress, and the APPS Committee makes any recommendations regarding the continuation or removal of Academic Warning. Academic Warning will not appear on the student's official transcript and will not be reported i n the MSPE ; Assign an Academic Probation: A student who fails a course or clinical rotation while on Academic Warning, fail multiple courses or clinical rotations, fail s COMLEX USA Level -1 or Level 2 -CE, fails to make satisfactory academic 269 progress, or exhibit any other issue identified by the APPS Committee will be placed on Academic Probation for a defined term. While on Academic Probation a student is not eligible to serve as a Student Government, club or organization officer, serve on a CUSOM commi ttee, receive an approved absence to attend an off -campus conference or meeting, serve as a Teaching Assistant, or participate in CUSOM -sponsored research, such as the Summer Research Scholars program . The record of each student on Academic Probation is r eviewed at the end of the defined term to evaluate the student's academic progress, and the APPS Committee makes any recommendations regarding the continuation or removal of Academic Probation. Academic Probation will appear on the student's official tran script, along with the date the Academic Probation was rectified. Academic Probation will be reported in the MSPE and state licensing board s where required ; Assign a Conduct Warning : Students who violate the Honor Code or display unprofessional behavior may receive a Conduct Warning for a defined term.

The Dean's decision is final. 6.7.9 Release of Information All documents and other information concerning student discipline, inclu ding written reprim ands, are securely maintain ed in a confid ential file. Such actions become a part of the student 's permanent education record but are only released at the written disc retion of the D ean. However, all disciplinary actions, with the exception of Admonitions, Academic and Conduct Warnings, are required to be reported on the M edical Student Performance Evaluation (M SPE). Additional information regarding Educational Records is provided in Section 6.3 of this Bulletin. 6.8 Separation from the Program 6.8.1 Separation from CUSOM There are four (4) categories of separation from CUSOM: Leave of Absence Withdrawal Suspension Dismissal The Dean makes all final decisions regarding any separation from CUSOM. All current or former students returning from an approved period away from CUSOM (such as, but not limited to, a Leave of Absence or an offer to repeat an academic year), must submit a completed Supplemental Application, Background Check, and Controlled Substance Screen which typically follows these timelines and associated requirements : 273 Separation from CUSOM (excluding Dismissal) less than 45 days: Supplemental Application may be required Background Check and Controlled Substance Screen may be required All required documents must be received no earlier than fifteen ( 15) calendar days and no later than seven ( 7) calendar days prior to the anticipated return date For example, a student returning from a 30 -day Leave of Absence on July 1st must submit the required documentation between June 15th and June 23rd. Separation fr om CUSOM (excluding Dismissal) greater than 44 days: Supplementa l Application, Background Check, and Controlled Substance Screen must be received no earlier than thirty ( 30) calendar days and no later than seven ( 7) calendar days prior to the anticipated return date For example, a student returning from a 60 -day Leave of Absence on July 1st must submit the required documentation between June 1st and June 23rd. Additional requirements, such as a medical or mental health evaluation, may be required of returning students as deemed appropriate. The Executive Committee of the CUSOM Admissions Committee, consisting of the Chair, two Vice -Chairs and at least two other members, will deter mine whether or not the st udent has met the requirements to return. In cases in which there is a potential conflict of interest or two of the above members are not available, the Dean may designate another member of the full Admissions Committee to participate. Students who do not return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the requirements for return, will need to re -apply through AACOMAS and may not be guaranteed re -admission. In order to return from any approved separation, the student must provide the Dean with documentation verifying completion of the terms of the approved separation. Once approved for return, the Executive Committee of the APPS Committee consisting of the Chair, two Vice -Chairs and at least two other members, will determine where the stud ent will resume the curriculum and if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume at a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the medical education curriculum and training required to be successful, perform well on licensing exams, and provide competent and compassionate patient care. In cases in which there is a potential conflict of interest or two of the above members are not available, the Dean may designate another member of the full APPS Committee to participate. 274 6.8.1.1 Accommodation Requests following return from a Separation All students, including those returning from any Separation from CUSOM lasting more than 180 days (including but not limited to Withdrawal, Academic L eave of Absence, Suspension, or return to repeat an academic year) requesting accommodations must follow the process as outlined in Sectio n 7.2.3 of this Bulletin . Students returning from a Separation from CUSOM, who are requesting accommodations, must contact the Office of Student Affairs to request services as soon as possible and identify their request in the \"Request for Accommodations\" section of the CUSOM Supplemental Application. This applies to a request to receive the same accommodations that were previously granted by CUSOM or a request to receive new accommodations upon r eturn from a Separation from CUSOM. The University is not responsible for identifying students with disabilities and is not required to provide services unless proper procedures have been f ollowed in making a request. As noted above, accommodations are n ot provided retroactively. 6.8.1.2 Modified Schedule In rare instances, a student may need to enter a Modified Schedule, which does not require a Leave of Absence, usually due to a brief acute illness, or personal emergency. In such cases, the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS -1 and MS-2 students) or the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs (MS -3 and MS-4), will develop a proposed Modified Schedule with the student which is subsequently approved by the Executive Committee of the APPS Committee. 6.8.2 Leave of Absence A Leave of Absence is granted by the Dean. A Leave of Absence is a temporary separation from CUSOM which may not last longer than 180 calendar days. Reasons for a leave include, but are not limited to, academic, perso nal, medical, and maternity. If a leave exceeds 180 calendar days, it will become a Withdrawal. A Leave of Absence is requested in writing, addressed to the Dean and delivered to the Office of Student Affairs , who then provides it to the Dean. A Leave of Absence request must include an anticipated date of return. The Dean in turn makes the final determination on the Leave of Absence request. 275 In addition, a Leave of Absence request requires completion of a Leave of Absence form available from t he Office of Student Affairs, and may or may not require the return of CUSOM issued items depending upon the specific circumstances of the Leave of Absence. Students requesting a Leave of Absence must schedule meetings and acquire signatures from the Offi ce of Financial Aid and the Bursar's Office as part of their leave process to avoid any ambiguity with the effect the leave may have on a student's financial aid. The date for a Leave of Absence is the date of the Dean's approval of the Leave of Absence r equest. Process for Returning from an Approved Leave from CUSOM of less than 180 days : 1. The Executive Committee of the CUSOM Admissions Committee consisting of the Chair, two Vice -Chairs and at least two other members, will review all relevant documentation and determine whether or not the student has met the requirements to return . In cases in which there is a potential conflict of interest or two of the above members are not available, the Dean may designate another member of the full Admiss ions Committee to participate. 2. If a student is approved for return, the Executive Committee of the APPS Committee consisting of the Chair, two Vice -Chairs and at least two other members will determine where the student will resume the curriculum and if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuri ng the appropriate continuum of the medical education curriculum and training required to be successful, perform well on licensing exams, and provide competent and compassionate patient care. In cases in which there is a potential conflict of interest or two of the above members are not available, the Dean may designate another member of the full APPS Committee to participate. 3. Students who do n ot return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all the r equirements for return, will need to re-apply throu gh AACOMAS and may not be guaranteed re-admission. 276 6.8.2.1 Academic Leave of Absence An Academic Leave of Absence is a unique situation, usually of a one-year duration, which allows students to pursue a research opportunity or complete a one -year post -secondary degree. Upon completion of this additional educational, experiential activity or scholarly pursuit, the student minimally must submit a completed Supplemental Appli cation, Background Check, and Controll ed Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM, as described in Section 6.8.1 of this Bulletin . In order to return from any approved Academic Leave of Absence , the student must provide do cumen tation verifying completion of the terms of the approved Academic Leave of Absence as described in Section 6.8.1 of this Bulletin . The letter from the Dean approving an Academic Leave of Absence will delineate any specific outcomes required upon return from the leave, such as a list of abstracts, publications, grants submitted, letter from the supervising research mentor, or other tangible evidence of productivity resulting from the leave. 6.8.2.2 Personal L eave of Absence A Personal Leave of Absence is granted by the Dean and may not last longer than 180 calendar days. A Personal Leave of Absence is available to address situations such as a death of a spouse, child, or such other circumstance that would interrupt a student's education. A Personal Leave of Absence lasting longer than 1 80 days will automatically become a Personal Withdrawal. In order to return from any approved Personal Leave of Absence, the student must provide the Dean with documentation verifying completion of the terms of the approved Personal Leave of Absence, as described in Section 6.8.1 of this Bulletin . 6.8.2.3 Medical Leave of Absence (Absence Less than 180 Calendar Days) A Medical Leave of Absence may be granted to students who provide acceptable supporting documentation indicating a valid medical reason requiring a leave of less than 180 calendar days and an anticipated date of return . Decisions regarding the granting of a medical leave are determined by the Dean. A Medical Leave of Absence may last no longer than 180 calendar days; if the leave extends beyond 180 calendar days it will automatically become a Medical Withdrawal as described below . 277 In order to return from an approved medical leave, the student must provide the Dean with documentation from a healthcare provider approving/releasing t he student to return as a full-time student in the curriculum as described in Section 6.8.1 of this Bulletin. 6.8.2.4 Student Maternity Leave of Absence A Student Maternity Leave of Absence may be granted to students who provide acceptable supporting documentation indicating a need to take a leave of absen ce because of their pregnancy. The required period of leave may include time before the delivery, after delivery, or both. This documentation must include an estimated date of delivery or, if a leave must be continue d beyond deliver y, the date delivery occurred. Decisions regarding th e granting of a maternity leave are determined by the Dean. A Student Maternity Leave of Absence extending more than 180 calendar days will require the student to file a request for a Medical Withdrawal. Return from a Maternity Leave of Absence In order to return from a Maternity Leave of Absence, a student must provide a medical note from her healthcare provider indicating the definitive date of return the student is medically cleared to resume all activities of the curriculum as a full -time student, with no restrictions. If the treating healthcare provider places an activity or time restriction on the student, the nature of the restriction(s) and the time frame for these restrictions must be well defined. Returning students must also complete and submit any additional requirements as delineated in Section 6.8.1 of this Bulletin. 6.8.2.5 Parental Leave of Absence CUSOM may grant leave for students whose significant other gives birth or adopts a child while enrolled in the curriculum. A Parental Leave of Absence may be granted on a case -by-case basis. Students requesting a parental leave of absence must prov ide appropriate documentation. 278 A Parental Leave of Absence may be up to four (4) weeks for non - birth parents following the birth, o r adoption, of a child. Following the birth or adoption, the non -birth parent will provide the Office of Student Affairs with an anticipated return -to-school date, not to exceed 4 -weeks from the beginning of the leave. Students unable to return from a Parental Leave of Absence within four (4) weeks following the birth, or adoption, of a child will be required to request a Personal Leave of Absence, which may last up to a total of 180 days. A Personal Leave of Absence ex tending more than 180 calendar days will require the student to file a request for a Personal Withdrawal . Students requesting a Parental Leave of Absence must complete the following requirements: Meet with either the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS-1 and MS-2) or Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs (MS -3 and MS-4), and the Office of Student Affairs at the earliest available time to discuss the anticipated Parental Leave. Provide the Office of Student Affairs a proposed timeline of the requested leave. 6.8.3 Withdrawal Withdrawal from CUSOM is granted by the Dean. A Withdrawal may be a temporary separation from CUSOM , which may last longer than 180 calendar days or a permanent separation from CUSOM. Reasons for a Withdrawal include, but are not limited to, personal , academic, and medical. In order to avoid a final grade being recorded on a student's transcript, any request for Withdrawal must be completed prior to beginning the first final course assessment (e.g., exam) of a Block or clinical rotation (e.g., end - of-rotation exam). This would include courses ending earlier than other courses in a Block (e.g., a student would need to withdraw before completing the Foundations in Medical Practice course, which typically ends prior to finals week). Failure to withdraw by this timefra me may result in issuance of a grade of F for all courses in that Block, or for that rotation, for the reasons described below, which will be recorded on the student's transcript and adversely affect the student's GPA. Withdrawal requests made after a gra de has been assigned , a course or clinical final examination or assessment event has been started , or after a clinical rotation completed, even if approved by the Dean, will result in the final grade being the grade of record. As such, a Withdrawal cannot remove a grade of F. 279 A Withdrawal is requested in writing, addressed to the Dean and delivered to the Office of Student Affairs , who then provides it to the Dean. The student must schedule meetings and acquire signatures from the Office of Financial Aid and the Bursar's Office as part of their leave process to avoid any ambiguity with the effect the leave may have on a student's financial aid. The Dean in turn make s the final determination on the Withdrawal request. The student must complete and return a Withdrawal Form and if approved, return any designated CUSOM issued items to the Office of Student Affairs before the student will be considered Withdrawn in Good Standing. The date for a Withdrawal is the date of the Dean's approval of the Withdrawal request. The Dean makes the final decision regarding Withdrawals. Students who discontinue their education at CUSOM, for any reason, are required to complete a Withdrawal Form. Students eligible to return from a Withdrawal from CUSOM, minimally must submit a completed Supplemental Application, Background Check, and Controlled Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM, as described in Section 6.8.1 of this Bulletin . Additional requirements, such as a medical or mental health evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. Students eligible to return from a Withdrawal are required to provide the Dean with do cumen tation verifying completion of the terms of the approved Withdrawal as described in Section 6.8.1 of this Bulletin . NOTE: Although different categories of Withdrawal are identified, the student transcript will reflect a \"W\" for any approved Withdrawal. 6.8.3.1 Personal Wit hdrawal Subject to Section 6.8.3, a Personal Withdrawal may be granted to students who wish to voluntarily leave CUSOM for personal reasons. Students withdrawing from CUSOM for personal reasons are not guaranteed re -admission.

A student returning from an approved Medical Withdrawal minimally must submit a completed Supplemental Application, Background Check, and Controlled Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM as delineated in Section 6.8.1 of this Bulletin. Additional requirements, such as a medical or mental health evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. In order to return from an approved Medical Withdrawal, the student must also provide the Dean with documentation from a healthcare provider approving/releasing the student to return as a full-time student in the curriculum as described in Section 6.8.1 of this Bulletin. The student may also be required to provide the Dean with additional documentation verifying completion of the terms of the approved Withdrawal as described in Section 6.8.1 of this Bulletin. 6.8.4 Special Meet ings of the APPS Committee The Dean may call a meeting of the APPS Committee to determine placement of a student who is returning from an approved Leave of Absence, Withdrawal, or Suspension to determine where the student will resume the program and to determine if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. 281 Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume at a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the medical education curriculum and training required to be successful, pass required licensing exams, and provide competent and compassionate patient care. 6.8.5 Suspension Suspension is defined as a temporary separation from the institution during which time students are not enrolled, not registered and are not eligible for financial aid . The duration of the Suspension will be determined by the Dean and may include recommendations from the APPS Committee. While on Suspension, students must not represent themselves as CUSOM students. In addition, they are not permitted to be on the University campus or affiliated clinical campuse s, participate in any clinical activities or wear their CUSOM white coat. If the terms set out under the Suspension are not fulfilled, or the student exceeds the Suspension term of 180 calendar days, the student will be referred to the APPS Committee for dismissal from the pro gram. 6.8.6 Dismissal The Dean makes the final decision on all student dismissals and this decision is not appealable. 6.9 Graduation 6.9.1 Graduation Requirements The degree of Do ctor of Osteopathic Medicine is granted to, and conferred upon, candidates who have : Satisfied all academic requirements, and completed the total number of credits required for their class as calculated at the time of graduation; Passed COMLEX -USA Level 1, COMLEX : COMLEX Level 2 -PE was suspended indefinitely in February 2021, and formally discontinued in June 2022. COMLEX -USA candidates are currently verified by attestation from their COM dean that they are proficient in these important clinical skills. . Addi tional information is available on the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners COMLEX -USA Level 2-PE website . 282 As such, to be eligible to graduate, each student must have successfully completed CUSOM's Clinical Skills Assessment Program, which includes both a longitudinal assessment of student performance and an on -campus multi -station Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE) during the fourth year. This multi -station OSCE, also called the Physical Exam -Qualifying Exam (PE-QE), requires students to demonstrate successfully the fundamental clinical skills and physician -related competency domains required for graduation, entrance into supervised graduate medical education programs, and the provision of safe osteopathic medical care of patients. Demonstrated good moral, professional, and ethical character; and Completed all required exit paperwork and settled a ll financial obligations with CUSOM, Campbell University , and affiliate and collaborative partners incurred during the academic program. In accordance with COCA standards, each fourth -year, single degree DO student must complete their education within 150% of the standard time (six (6) years following matriculation). To become eligible for graduation, each student must successfully complete all program requirements within six (6) years following matriculation. The six (6) years allow for the completion of a Modified Course of Study due to medical, academic, or other leave of absence. The Dean may grant an extension to this 6 -year rule, in exceptional circumstances . Professional and ethical competence is required for graduation. Students mu st demonstrate the ethical and professional qualities deemed necessary for success and continued study and practice of osteopathic medicine; the suitability for the practice of medicine by dutiful and responsible acceptance for patient care; and integrity in the conduct of clinical duties.

In addition to this requirement, the student must have been enrolled full -time a t CUSOM during their entire third and fourth academic years. Students must complete to the satisfaction of the faculty, as determined by the individual course directors, clinical rotation preceptors and through the APPS Committee, all prescribed courses and clinical experiences to graduate. The 283 Dean makes the determination on any student appeals of APPS Committee or Vice Dean recommendations according to the process delineated in Section 6 .7 of this Bulletin. Students must meet with Financial Aid and complete all required exit documentation , including financial aid and debt counseling, in order to receive a diploma. CUSOM students must also attend the exit process in order to receive a diploma. Upon passage of COMLEX -USA Level 1, Level 2 -CE, CUSOM's Clinical Skills Assessment Program (in lieu of COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE as described above) , and all other requirements as delineated in this Academic Bulletin, the Faculty of CUSOM, through the Dean and President, recommends degree candidates to the Board of Trustees. Upon approval of the recommendation, the Board of Trustees confers the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree on students successfully completing all requirements for graduation. 6.9.2 Delayed Graduation Policy If a student is suspended, takes a Leave of Absence or Withdrawal, or is required to retake courses in the curriculum as a result of specific course or clinical rotation failures or a deficiency in overall academic performance, the student will be placed in a Modified Course of Study (MCOS). As discussed in Section 6.6.3 , a Modified Course of Study (MCOS) is a credit -bearing, individualized study plan for students who require an alternative educational pathway for reasons such as board preparation, required remediation, illness, leaves of absence, or withdrawals. The ins titution of a MCOS may result in a delay in the scheduling and completion of a student's clinical rotations and graduation date. Voluntary withdrawals, leaves of absence, suspensions secondary to academic or non -academic matters, or failure to pass Board exams consistent with CUSOM policy may also result in a delay in the scheduling and completion of a student's clinical rotations and graduation date. Six (6) Year Graduation Requirement : All single degree DO students, including those who require a Modifie d Course of Study, must complete their education within six (6) years following matriculation. To become eligible for graduation, each student must successfully complete all graduation requirements within six (6) years following matriculation. Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression may affect a student's financial aid status or qualification for education -based financial aid.

Additional information is available on the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Exami ners COMLEX -USA Level 2-PE website . As such, to be eligible to graduate, each student must have successfully completed CUSOM's Clinical Skills Assessment Program, which includes both a longitudinal assessment of student performance and an on -campus multi -station Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE) during the fourth year. This multi -station OSCE, also called the Physical Exam -Qualifying Exam (PE-QE), requires students to demonstrate successful ly the fundamental clinical skills and physician -related competency domains required for graduation, entrance 285 into supervised graduate medical education programs, and the provision of safe osteopathic medical care of patients. 6.9.3 Hooding Policy The CUSOM Hooding Policy outlines the requirements for an individual to be allowed to hood CUSOM graduates conferred with the degree Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine. The Dean designates the specific hooders to participate in each Commencement ceremony. This i ncludes participating immediate family members who may be eligible and approved to serve as a hooder as discussed below. All hooders of graduates receiving the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree must be CUSOM Faculty or hold either the DO or Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree from an accredited medical school. Members of the graduation ceremony platform party who do not hold the DO or MD degree may be permitted to hood graduates upon approval by the Dean. Immediate family members who hold either the DO or MD degree from an accredited medical school may be permitted to hood graduates upon approval by the Dean. For the purposes of this Policy, an immediate family member is defined as a person who is connected to the graduate by blood or marriage -- spouse, parent(s), parent -in-law, brother, sister, son, daughter, grandparent(s), aunt, uncle, cousin, nephew, niece, or sibling -in-law. Family hooders are required to wear appropriate academic regalia during the Commencement ceremony. Family hooders w ho do not own their own regalia are responsible for any costs associated with the rental/purchase of regalia for the ceremony. Students who participate in Commencement ceremonies outside of the CUSOM Commencement Ceremony in May will not be able to design ate specific hooders for their Commencement ceremony (i.e., no family hooders at any graduation other than the May ceremony). These policies and procedures may change due to unforeseen circumstances. 286 6.10 Grievance Processes 6.10.1 Resolution and Grievance Proced ure CUSOM recognizes the need for students to voice grievances and to seek resolution to problems, disagreements with faculty/administrators, or interpretations of institutional policy. CUSOM also recognizes the responsibility of the studen t to express their concerns in a professional and ethical manner. Concerns may involve course grades other than a grade reviewed by the APPS Committee, promotion, behavioral issues, financial concerns or issues related to external (e.g. COCA, SACSCOC) acc reditation standards and procedures. This grievance process shall not be used to appeal or review violations of the Honor Code or an appeal from the APPS Committee final decision by the Dean or the APPS Committee. All grievances must be filed in writing to the CUSOM Office of the Dean. All grievance material is securely maintained in the Dean's Office in a specific student/employee/faculty file as appropriate to the grievance. Each step of the Resolution and Grievance Procedure generally take s fourteen (14) calendar days to complete, unless otherwise noted. Extensions or waivers to this timeframe may be granted on a case -by-case basis. Notice of a request for an extension from a student must be submitted in writing to the Dean within ten (10) calendar days prior to the deadline.

Student Policies and Services 7.1 Student Wellness As future physicians, it is important for CUSOM students to maintain good personal, physical, and mental health. With this in mind, CUSOM offers several services to support student physical and mental well-being. CUSOM encourages students to seek assistance for themselves or fellow classmates early if they encounter any physical or mental health concerns. 7.1.1 Student Health CUSOM students are able to utilize the Campbell University Health Center for confidential diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic medical services , and personal health concerns. All personal medical information is kept confidential in compliance with HIPAA regulations. The Campbell University Health Center office hours can be found on the Health Center website . For medical emergencies and after -hours healthcare, students are encouraged to access appropriate care as warranted by their situ ation including local Urgent Care facilities, Emergency Departments and Emergency Medical Services. In an emergency, students should access EMS and the 911 -dispatch system. Students needing health services while on Clinical Rotations away from CUSOM, sho uld refer to Section 5.7.2 of this Bulletin. Further information may be found on the Health Center website . 7.1.2 Health Insurance All students are required to have health insurance at the time of matriculation and maintain health insurance coverage through graduation. Students are required to either enroll in Campbell University's health insurance plan or provide proof of active health insurance coverage obtained through another company. Before registration and before the beginning of class or clinical rotations annually, all students must either provide pro of of health insurance and sign the Campbell University insurance waiver or purchase the health insurance made available through Campbell University. Students without active health insurance coverage will not be permitted to participate in any patient car e clinical activities. 296 Any medical costs incurred by students as a result of exposure to infectious diseases or materials, needle sticks, injuries (falls, burns, lacerations, etc.) or other medical or surgical conditions while a student at CUSOM are the responsibility of the student and their health insurance carrier. Information on Campbell University's health insurance plan is available on the Student Health Insurance website . 7.1.3 Vaccinations Students must obtain all CUSOM -required vaccinations and corresponding titers, prior to matriculation and remain compliant with all vaccination requirements through graduation in order to complete all clinical requirements in the CUSOM curriculum. Regulatory and legislative authorities require students to demonstrate vaccination, immunity or protection from multiple contagious diseases before being allowed to participate in clinical experiences. Descriptions of CUSOM vaccination and testing requirements, including those addressing Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Varicella, Hepatitis B, Influenza, and COVID -19 and Tuberculosis are presented in Section 3.16.1 of this Bulletin. All incoming and current students must log all vaccination requirements on the linked standard AAMC Standard Immunization Form . This form must be completed in its entirety and signed by a physician or qualified healthcare provider verifying the required information. In addition, students are required to submit supporting documentation such as vaccination records and titers. Non-compliance with CUSOM Vaccination Requirements may result in the inability to participate in any clinical experiences, including, but not limited to, standardized patient OSCEs, early clinical experiences, and clinical rotations. This may result in unexcus ed absences leading to failure of a course or clinical rotation(s), referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee, Academic Probation, Suspension, delay in graduation, or even Dismissal from the program. Additional i mporta nt information regarding CUSOM Vaccination Requirements is presented in Section 3.16 .1 of this Bulletin. 297 7.1.4 Controlled Substance Screening Protocol Controlled substance screening of learners and staff members is mandatory at most healthcare facilities prior to participating in patient care. As such, a controlled substance screening test showing no evidence of alcohol, illicit substances, prescription medications without a valid prescription, or substances classified as illegal in the state o f North Carolina, is required before matriculation into CUSOM and again before the start of Year Three of the program. Additional screening or confirmatory tests may be required as determined by CUSOM or affiliated clinical training sites. CUSOM reserves the right to require controlled substance testing or a mental health evaluation of any student when there is an incident of erratic or unusual behavior or there is a reasonable concern due to a student's behavior, appearance, or performance. Refusal or f ailure to submit to required testing may result in disciplinary action up to, and including, dismissal from the program. Students found to have screening tests positive for alcohol, illicit substances, and controlled substances (defined as a drug or subst ance listed in Schedules I through V of the Federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7812)) or prescription medications without a valid prescription may be subject to disciplinary action up to, and including, dismissal. Please note this also includes substances classified as illegal in the state of North Carolina but which may be legal in other states. For example, although the use of marijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abu se impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to his or her patients. As such, the use of marijuana in any form is a violation of University policy. CUSOM will provide clinical rotation sites with a copy of the results of an y controlled substance screening performed on students prior to, and for the duration of, their placement at the site. By matriculating at CUSOM, students grant CUSOM the right to share this information as deemed appropriate. Clinical education sites may set their own standards regarding whom they will permit to participate in clinical rotations based on the results of the controlled substance screening or require students undergo further testing. CUSOM has no control over the content of third -party Back ground Checks, which may include charges of Driving Under the Influence (DUI), Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), or similar offenses. Background Checks revealing prior criminal activity, even charges which may have been dismissed by the courts, could still result in consequences affecting clinical rotations, acceptance into residency programs, future licensing, specialty board certification, or employment opportunities. 298 If a student is unable to complete clinical rotations due to the inability to pass cont rolled substance testing requirements, they will not be capable of making academic progress or be able to meet graduation requirements . In addition, and as such, they will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Stand ards (APPS) Committee for possible sanctions up to, and including, dismissal from the program. Prior to Starting Year 3 Clinical Rotations: A random controlled substance screening is required prior to starting clinical rotations, and all results are shared with the clinical sites. Students must have the controlled substance screening sample collected at a facility approved by CUSOM. If the test result is positive or shows other abnormalities, the Dean will appoint an ad hoc subcommittee, a subset of the CUSOM APPS Committee , to review the information and make a recommendation regarding an appropriate action to the Dean who will make the final decision. Depending on this decision, the student's advancement to the third year of the curriculum (clinical rotations) may be delay ed based on the results. Results of controlled substance screenings are made available to clinical rotation sites. By matriculating at CUSOM, students grant CUSOM the right to share this information as deemed appropriate. All controlled substance screen ing tests are maintained in a secure location to ensure confidentiality. Access to this information is limited to the Office of Student Affairs , the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, the CUSOM Dean (or Vice Dean as the Dean's designee), and the Campbel l University General Counsel. Results from positive controlled substance screens are shared with the Associate Dean for Behavioral Health in the event the student requires drug/alcohol counseling. The entire cost of any testing is the responsibility of t he student. If a student is unable to complete clinical rotations due to the inability to pass controlled substance testing requirements, they will not be capable of making academic progress or be able to meet graduation requirements. In addition, and as such, the student will be referred to the APPS Committee for possible sanctions up to, and including, dismissal from the program. 299 By signing the Attestation confirming that students have read and acknowledge compliance with the precepts contained in the DO Academic Bulletin, each applicant to CUSOM attests they are not currently using, and they will not use while a CUSOM student, any products or substances in any manner which are illegal in the state of North Carolina or prohibited by CUSOM policy . 7.1.5 Infection Control Students exposed to an infectious disease should consult the Campbell University Health Center (910) 893 -1560 for information regarding appropriate evaluation, testing, and treatment. Students presenting with signs or symptoms of infectious or communicable disease should consult with Campbell University's Health Center or the infection control office at the clini cal site to determine if it is safe for them to continue providing care and if not, when it is safe to resume. Standard Precautions The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has developed precautions to prevent accidental spread of infectious disease in healthcare settings. These include standard precautions for all patient care and transmission -based precautions for situations in which specific infections are identified or suspected. A comprehensive de scription of these precautions is found on the CDC's website . Standard precautions make us e of common -sense practices and personal protective equipment to protect healthcare providers from infection and prevent the spread of infection from patient -to-patient; examples include, but are not limited to, the following: Handwashing (or using an antiseptic hand rub) After touching blood, b ody fluids, secretions, excretions and contaminated items; Immediately after removing gloves ; and Between patient contact Comp rehensive CDC guidelines for hand hygiene in healthcare settings are found on the CDC's website . Gloves For contact with blood, body fluids, secretions and contaminated items; For contact with mucous membranes and non-intact skin 300 Masks, goggles, face masks Protect mucous membranes of eyes, nose and mouth when contact with blood or bo dy fluids is likely Gowns Protect skin from blood or body fluid contact; Prevent soil ing of clothing during proc edures possibly involving contact with blood or b ody fluid Linen Handle soiled linen as to prevent touching skin or mucous membranes; Do not pre-rinse soiled linens in patient care areas Patient care equipment Handle soiled equipm ent in a mann er to prevent contact with skin or mucous membranes and to prevent contamination of clothing or the environment; Clean reusable equipment prior to reuse Environmental cleaning Routinely care, clean and disin fect equipment and furnishi ngs in patient care areas Sharps Avoid recapping used needles; Avoid removi ng used needles from disposable syringes; Avoid bending, breaking, or mani pulating used needles by hand; Place used sharps in puncture-resistant containers Addition al information is available on the CDC's website . Patient resuscitation Use mouthpieces, resuscitation bags, or other ventilation devices to avoid mouth- to-mouth resuscitation Patient placement Place patients who contaminate the environment or cannot maintain appropriate hygiene in private rooms Needle sticks Incidents involving needle sticks and potential exposure to blood -borne pathogens require immediate action to protect a student's health and safety. CDC guidelines for the prevention of blood -borne infectious disease 301 following an exposure are found on the CDC Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure website . If a student sus tains a needle stick or is exposed to infectious m aterials they shoul d: Immediately w ash exposure site thoroughly with soap and water (or water only for mucous me mbranes). Immediately notify the clinical supervisor at the rotation site for assistance. Call or physically g o to the Campbell U niversity Health Center or the occupational health clinic or area of the clinical facility designated for treating needle stick exposur es. Time ly consultation concerning appropriate tests, risk-assessment couns eling, and chemoprophylaxis decisions are critical. Be evaluated immediately following an exposure event to determine if HIV post -exposure prophylaxis is appropriate. HIV post-exposure prophylaxis is most effective when initiated within the first few hours following an exposure so it is critical students are evaluated in a timely manner . This will ensure if post-exposure prophylaxis is indicated, then it is started as early as possible in order to increase its effectiveness. Proceed immediately to the Emergency Department for evaluation if exposure has occurred after normal business hours or, if for any other r eason unable to be evaluated at one of the above locations. Complete an incident report from the facility in which the incident occurred and have a copy of the report sent to the Campbell University Health Center (PO Box: 565, 129 T.T. Lanier St., Buies Creek, NC 27506). Send treatment and testing bills to the student's insurance company. Students are responsible for all costs not covered by their insurance. CDC guidelines for the prevention of blood -borne infectious dis ease follow ing an exposure are found on the CDC Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure website . In the event of an exposure, the National Clinician's Post -Exposure Prophylaxis Hotline (PEPline) is available by phone, (888) 448 -4911, 11am -8pm Eastern, seven days per week to provide guidance in managing exposures. For exposures or questions that occur outside these hours, a PEP Quick Guide for Occupational Exposures is available on their PEP: Post - Exposure Prophylaxis website . The following addit ional CDC guidelines for the pr evention of inf ection transmission in healthcare settings should be reviewed carefully before participating in any patient care activities: CDC Guide to Infection Prevention for Outpatient Settings CDC Infection Control Basics 302 7.1.6 Medical Emergencies The safety of students, faculty, staff, and visitors to the Health Science Campus is of utmost concern and the utilization of a standard approach to medical emergencies will ensure the provision of the most timely, efficient, and appropriate care in a medical emergency. As a school of osteopathic medicine, CUSOM's focus and expertise is in the domain of medical education. While many capable and compassionate healthcare providers are present on our campus on any given day, their role in this setting is as educators and administrators rather than as clinicians. While able to render immediate assistance in a life -threatening emergency, these individuals should not be consulted to make treatment or disposition recommendations in non -emergent situations. Anyone suffering from a medical emergency must be evaluated by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) , which is activated by dialin g 9-1-1. If anyone on the Health Science Campus suffers from a medical emergency, the first person in contact with the patient should dial 911 immediately to summon EMS assistance. Following activation of the EMS system, security must be notified of the situation and is responsible for contacting EMS to confirm the need for emergency response as well as to provide them with more detailed information regarding the location of the patient and instructions for appropriate access to the building. Security will complete and maintain an incident report form for any situation in which EMS is called to provide assistance even if the patient ultimately refuses treatment or transport. Incident Reporting If a student suffers an accident resulting in an injury during a CUSOM activi ty while on campus, the student must comple te an incident report, and call or go to the Campbell University Health Center for consultation and assistance. Incident reports can be obtained from the Campbell University Health Center (910) 893 -1560. If the accident occurs at a clinical training facility, that facility's incident report form should be completed, and the clinical supervisor, the Office of Clinical Affairs, the Regional Dean /Director of Student Medical Education ( DSME ), and the CUSOM Associat e Dean for Clinical Affairs should be contacted immediately for assistance. A copy of the facility's incident report must be sent to: Campbell University Health Center P.O. Box: 565 129 T.T. Lanier St. Buies Cr eek, NC 27506 303 7.1.7 HIPAA and OSHA Training HIPAA Training CUSOM is committed to ensuring the privacy and security of all patient health information as required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). As such, all students are required to complete HIPAA training each a cademic year. To support the commitment to patient confidentiality, CUSOM and its clinical partners have developed processes to ensure appropriate steps are taken to verify the identity and authority of individuals and entities requesting protected health information as required under 45 C.F.R. \u00a7164.514(h) and other applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Additionally, CUSOM ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems containing electronic ally protected health information by implementing policies to prevent, detect, mitigate, and correct security violations. CUSOM is in compliance with the US Department of Health and Human Services' Privacy Rule as it applies to the creation, collection, use , or disclosure of all individual health information (whether identifiable or not) (\"Information\") in connection with CUSOM. OSHA Training All CUSOM students enrolled in the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine program receive OSHA Blood -Borne Pathogens (BBP) training which addresses the prevention of transmission of communicable pathogens. Students complete OSHA training annually during which time they review OSHA rules, requirements, appropriate plans and practices. CUSOM has the following plans in place: Blood-borne Pathogen Exposure Plan Infectious Waste Management Plan Biohazard Waste Management Plan 7.2 Behavioral Health Confidential counseling services and mental health care, including access to a mental health representative, are available 24-hours -a-day, seven -days-a-week in a confidential manner through a combination of resources which includes clinical services offered by the CUSOM Department of Behavioral Health (CUSOM BH) under the leadership of the Departmental Chair and Clinical Direc tor (https://m edicine.campbell.edu/behavioral-health) and MYgroup , a 24/7/365 student assistance program offering wrap -around psychosocial support services. All requests 304 for information or assistance through the MYgroup program are free of charge and completely confidential.

Anyone with concerns regarding a student's potential risk of harming themselves or someone else should cont act CUSOM's Office of Student Affairs or Campbell University's Associate Vice President for Campus Life to initiate the CUBIT process. 911 Emergency Medical Services should be contacted immediately if there is a concern regarding an imminent threat to the safety of the student or others. The CUBIT process is outlined in this Bulletin and the \"Institutional Policies\" section of the Campbell University Main Campus Undergraduate Student Handbook . 7.2.3 Accommodations Policy Campbell University is committed to providing equal educational opportunity for persons with disabilities in accordance with the nondiscrimination policy of the University and in compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and with the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. The ADA states that a person with a \"disability\" is: \"Someone with a physical or ment al impairment which substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; or a person with a record of such impairment; or a person who is regarded as having such an impairment.\" Equal educational opportunity means a person with a disability who is qualified for admission must have access to the same university programs, services, and activities as all other students. If necessary to provide equal opportunity, Campbell will make reasonable modifications to its policies, practices and procedures, unless doing so w ould fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity or pose an undue administrative or financial burden. 307 Under the law, universities may not discriminate in the recruitment, admission, educational process, or treatment of students. Students who have self- identifi ed, provid ed document ation of disabili ty, and requested r easonable accommodations are entitled to receive approved modifications of programs, appropriate academic adjustments, or auxiliary aids that enable them to participate in and benefit from all educational programs and activities. The law specifies unive rsities may not limit the number of students with disabili ties admitted, make preadmissions inquiries as to wh ether or not an applicant has a disabi lity, use admission tests or criteria that inadequately m easure the acade mic qualifications of students with disabili ties because s pecial provisions were not mad e, exclude a qualified student with a disabili ty from any course of study, or establi sh rul es and pol icies that may adversely affect students wi th disabili ties. In support of its commitment to provide equal educational oppo rtunity, Campbell provid es a variety of services and accommodations to students with document ed disabili ties. Campbell Univ ersity's Student Guide for Acce ssing Disability Services can be accessed here. Questions or comments about this manual should be directed to: Laura Rich Director of Disability Services Student Services, Telephone: will make reasonable accommodations as required by law for students whose disabilities will not prevent them from successfully completing the entire CUSOM curriculum and graduating as an osteopathic physician (Section 3.5 of this Bulletin). Students, however, are required to function with independence and perform at all skill levels described below which CUSOM holds as mandatory for the safe and effective practice of osteopathic medicine. CUSOM is committed to patient safety and assuring a safe and effective environment that does not place patients, students, or others at unnecessary risk. Each Technical Standard has been chosen from standards osteopathic physicians deem necessary for the safe and effective practice of osteopathic medicine. Applicants who do not meet the Technical Standards and Vaccination Requirements should not apply to CUSOM. 308 Matriculating or Cur rent CUSOM Students with Disa bilities 7.2.3.1 Section I: Who to Contact Students with do cument ed disabili ties who d esire mod ifications or accommodations must c ontact the CUSOM Office of Student Affairs . No accommodations will be made without approval through the University's pro cess. A medi cal, psychological or other diagnosis may rise to the level of a disabili ty if it substantially limits one or more major life functions, one of which is learning. A dis ability may be tempor ary or ongoing. 7.2.3.2 Section II: How to Obtain Services For any student deemed eligible, CUSOM provides accommodations or modifications to policies and practices in order to ensure that all students have equal access to all CUSOM programs, services, and activities. The purpose of accommodations is to provide access and equal educational opportunity for all students. Accommodations are not provided retroactively. Any student approved for accommodations is entitled to services and accommodations only from the date th e approval is given. Even if the student can establish they had a disability at the time of the course in question, CUSOM will not expunge or re -examine coursework completed before the student was reviewed and approved for accommodation(s). No student is required to disclose their disability to the University. However, as discussed above, any student who discloses and receives approved accommodations after they have begun study at CUSOM will not receive any retroactive accommodations on work completed before the approval for accommodations was granted . Documentation of a student's disability is only shared with relevant CUSOM faculty, staff or administration on a need -to-know basis with a release of information signed by the student. General Procedure for Receiving Accommodations Step 1: Incoming or current students are required to contact the Office of Student Affairs to request services as soon as possible. The Univ ersity is not responsible for identi fying students with disabili ties and is not required to provide services unless proper pro cedures have been follow ed in making a request. 309 Step 2: The student must schedule a meeting with the Office of Student Affairs , who consul ts with the Director of Disability Services to provide document ation of the disability and to co mplete the appropriate paperwork. Step 3: The Office of Student Affairs reviews the student's request and supporting do cument ation with the Director of Disability Services to determine, through an interactive process consistent with policy and the requirements for granting accommodations, what reasonable accommodations may be indicated and available for a student's specific situation , and based in part on the nature of the student's disability. Decisions re garding accommodations are made on a case-by-case basis. There is no stand ard accommodation for any particular disabili ty. CUSOM will make r easonable modifi cations to its policies, practices and pro cedures, unless doing so would fundament ally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity or pose an undue administrative or fin ancial burden. General Do cumentation Guidelines To ensure reasonable and appropriate services and accommodations are provided to students with disabilities, students requesting such accommodations and services must provide current documentation of their disability. Such documentation generally must include the following: A clear diagnostic statement of the disability prepared by a licensed professional A description of the mann er in which the disab ility limits the student in a specified major life activity and the s everity of the limitation It is the responsibility of the student requesting the accommodations and services to provide documentation of the disability. As such, the cost of evaluations required pursuant to these guidelines is to be borne by the student. If there is a change in the student's condition, they may request modifications to previously approved accommodations. The student will have to provide current supporting documentation for review at that time. 310 Guidelines for Documenting a L earning Dis ability Every report should be on letterhead, typed, dated, signed and otherwise legible, and be comprised of the following elements: Eval uator I nformation: The n ame, t itle, and credentials of the qu alified pro fessional who condu cted the assessment should b egin the r eport. Please note that memb ers of the student's family and CUSOM faculty and staff are not consid ered appropriate evaluato rs. Recent Assessment: The report m ust provide adequate info rmation about the stude nt's current level of functioning. If such information is missing, the student may be asked to provide a more recent or complete assessment. Testing: There should be a discu ssion of all tests that were administ ered, observations of the student's behavior during testing, and a listing of all test scores (i.e., domain, cluster, subtest, index, etc.) represented in standard scores or percentile ranks. Informal assessment, an Individualized Education Plan (IEP), or a 504 plan may help to supplement a more comprehensive test battery but are generally insufficient documentation when presented alone. In addition, a clinical summary and a clearly stated diagnosis are helpful and must be included in the report. The summary should integrate the elements of the battery with background information, observations of the client during the testing situation, and the student's current academic situation. This summa ry should present evidence of a substantial limitation to learning and explain how the patterns of strength and weakness are sufficiently significant to substantiate a learning disability diagnosis. It should also demonstrate that the evaluator has ruled out alternative explanations for the learning problem. If social or emotional factors are possible obstacles to learning, they should be addressed in the summary. This summary may include recommended accommodations, but these are in no way binding to the University. CUSOM reserves the right to evaluate all documentation with the Director of Disability Services to determine, through an interactive process consistent with policy and the requirements for granting accommodations, what reasonable accommodatio ns may be indicated and available for a student's specific situation, and based in part on the nature of the student's disability. 311 Step 4: If the request for accommodations is approved, the Office of Student Affairs generate s a Letter of Accommodation (LOA) documenting the studen t's individual, approved accommodations. The O ffice of Student Affairs coordi nates dissemination of the LOA. Any student whose requested accommodations are not approved is encouraged to meet with the Office of Student Affairs to discuss the reasons for the denial. The Office of Student Affairs may discuss the Grievance procedure with the student at this time. Accommodations on COMLEX-USA Exams Students who want to request accommodations for any COMLEX - USA examination must submit their applications directly to the NBOME within the timeframe designated by the NBOME. Additional information regarding testing accommodations for COMLEX -USA examinations is available on th e NBOME's Test Accommodations website . CUSOM is not responsible for requesting or approving COMLEX - USA testing accommodations. Note: The NBOME has specific accommodation criteria and may deny a student's accommodation request, even if that student has been granted accommodations by CUSOM. Service Animal Information According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a service animal is defined as \"any animal individually trained to work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability \". This includ es, but is not limited to, guiding individuals with impaired vision, alerting individuals to an impending seizure or protecting individuals during one, alerting individ uals who are hearing impaired to intruders, pulling a wheelchair and fetching dropped items\". Providing comfort or support does not qualify an animal as a service animal. If there are any questions as to whether an animal qualifies as a service animal, the Office of Student Affairs with consultation with the Director of Disability Services will make this determination . In compliance with the ADA, service animals are welcome in all buildings on campus and may attend any class, meeting, or other event. Service animals are expected to exhibit reasonable behavior while on campus. The owners of disruptive and aggressive ser vice animals will be asked to remove them from university facilities. If the improper behavior happens repeatedly, the owner will be told not to bring the service animal into any facility until they take significant steps to mitigate the behavior. 312 Emotion al support animals are animals that provide comfort and relieve symptoms of mental health disorders. Emotional support animals are not allowed in campus buildings, including classrooms and dining facilities unless it is deemed as a reasonable accommodatio n and will be included in the student's Letter of Accommodation (LOA) from CUSOM. The CUSOM Office of Student Affairs can provide further information. Cleanliness of any approved service or emotional support animal on campus is mandatory. Consideration of others must be taken into account when providing maintenance and hygiene of animals. The owner is expected to clean up and dispose of all animal waste. If the service or emotional support animal becomes a disruption to other students, the animal must be removed to a location which does not cause a disruption to the education of other students. Service Animals in Clinical Training Clinical education sites may have their own regulations, policies, and procedures regarding the permissibility of service animals in the clinical setting, and which may differ from those of Campbell University. CUSOM has no control over an individual clinical site's requirements as related to service animals. Students must coordinate these requests with the clinical site Re gional Dean/DSME, Human Resources, ADA coordinator, or designated individual at the institution. Confidentiality of Information Information received from a student is governed under the provisions of the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974. Under the provisions of this law, students in post -secondary education have the right to inspect and review their sc hool records as defined by law. Only those faculty and staff members of CUSOM have access to information collected for use in accom plishing necessary tasks for the student. Any information gathered is not released to third parties except in accordance with state and federal law. By matriculating at CUSOM, a student agrees that CUSOM may share their graduate medical education (residency training program) Match data. A student has the right to review their own file and as a courtesy to the individual, copies of documents and information obtained will be provided at no cost with limitations. 313 7.2.3.3 Section III: Student Responsibilities General Student Responsibilities 1. Identify themselves to the Office of Student Affairs to begin the process of requesting accommodations. CUSOM is not respons ible for identi fying students with disabili ties or for contacting such students to begin the accommodation request process. 2. Document ation which conforms to the University's guidelines must be provided by the student. If the student's document ation is insuf ficient for any reason, the student is respons ible for acquiring any additional required document ation and to p ay any costs thereof.

Any student approved for accommodations is respons ible for retrieving his or h er Letter of A ccommodation (LOA) and Release of Information Form f rom the Office of Student Affairs . Responsibilities of a Student Approved for Testing Accommodations Testing accommodations require frequent communication between the student and the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education (Years 1 and 2) or Department of Clinical Affairs (Years 3 and 4). It is very important that testing information be shared with these offices in a timely manner. At the beginning o f the semester, and at least one week prior to the first scheduled quiz and exam , the student should discuss with the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education or the Department of Clinical Affairs all approved testing accommodations. This discussion should address the questions of how, when and where the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education or the Department of Clinical Affairs will provide the testing accommodations. The student should make sure to have a calendar an d a copy of the LOA with him/her at the time of this discussion. The student should also remind the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education or the Department of Clinical Affairs of their need for accommodations at least one week prior to each quiz/exam. If at any time a student believes the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education, or the Department of Clinical Affairs is not adequately meeting their accommodations, the student should discuss this concern with the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education or Department of Clinical Affairs and the Office of Student Affairs immediately. 314 The Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education or the Department of Clinical Education is only required to provide accommodations specifically listed in the Letter of Accommodation. Responsibilities of a Student Approved for Handicapped Parking Students who use handicapped parking on campus must maintain state-issued handicap parking permits.

Students are also encouraged to exercise their rights of complaint through the Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights and other legal channels if needed. 315 7.3 Clubs and Organizations 7.3.1 Student Clubs and Organizations Student clubs and organizations are a very important part of the Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUSOM). The service performed by members of student organizations benefits not only the community and the region, but al so the members, as they gain valuable knowledge, skills, and experience. Many CUSOM students are actively involved in at least one organization, and some students are members of several. CUSOM students may serve as officers or committee members at the state, regional , or national level.

As such, student participation and contributions are solicited whenever possible. Appointments to Committees differs from appointment as a Student Government representative or class leader, and appointment to, and service on, a CUSOM Committee should be considered a privilege. The process begins with the Office of Academic Affairs identifying student vacancies o n CUSOM Committees, as approved by the Dean, prio r to the start of each academic year (and as vacancies arise within an academic year). Student members of CUSOM Committees must meet pre -identified criteria including, but not limited to, the student being in good standing at all times relative to: Acade mic standing: A cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale is required at the time of appointment. If the GPA falls below the minimum required for appointment at any time, the student will be required to step down from service to focus on her/his aca demics. This requirement also includes COMLEX performance, and any student failing any level of COMLEX must relinquish their role on any CUSOM Committee. Professionalism: No student is permitted to serve on a CUSOM Committee if they are on Conduct Probat ion or otherwise have any Honor Code or Professionalism infractions. Committee service of students with an Admonition or Conduct Warning is determined based on the recommendation of the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee at the time the Admonition or Conduct Warning is assigned or by the APPS Committee Chair if an Admonition is assigned by the Chair instead of an APPS Committee hearing . If an appointed student has a documented professionalism issue at any time, the stude nt will be required to step down from the committee service. Other: All other requirements necessary to be a registered student in good standing, such as payment of tuition, must be met. First-year students may not serve on CUSOM Committees, except in rare circumstances, until they successfully complete Block 2. At designated times in the first - and second -year of medical school, the class officers are asked by the Office of Student Affairs to solicit names of students who have interest in the identified CUSOM Committees which include student membership. The Office of Student Affairs provides the charge of each Committee and the desired qualities of the ideal student member. 326 Interested students submit materials addressing how they meet the stated needs of the Committee based on their interests and experiential base. These materials are submitted to the class officers at a time designated by the Office of Student Affairs in conjunction with the class officers. The class officers review all submissions in a fair, impartial, and unbiased manner , and send to the Office of Student Affairs their recommendations for no more than three (3) students they identify for each Committee vacancy. The Office of Student Affairs then works with the Office of Academic Aff airs to ensure each student recommended meets all the stated prerequisites for service. Once verified, the names are forwarded to the respective Committee Chairs, who are given a brief timeframe to review the applications and select the student(s) they wi sh to invite to serve on the committee. The Office of Student Affairs will notify the students selected, as well as those not selected, of the outcome. All faculty and student committee appointments are subject to approval by the Dean. 327 8. Research and Scho larly Activity 8.1 Research at CUSOM Research is fundamental to, consistent with, and a prerequisite for excellence in teaching and the creation of a scholarly atmosphere for learning. CUSOM recognizes the critical role for developing its research capac ity in order to continue to attract and retain top -tier faculty and students, thereby training students for productive careers in osteopathic medicine, biomedical research, and in making valuable contributions to society. Research and scholarly activity a t CUSOM may take different forms, which may include basic biomedical research, translational research, clinical research, and medical educational research. 8.2 Policy Statement on Student Research and Scholarly Activity CUSOM strives to advance scientific and medical knowledge and to promote the distinctive philosophy and practice of osteopathic medicine. As part of CUSOM's support of students in the area of scholarly activity, students receive instruction in research sk ills and complete a scholarly project paper as part of the curriculum in the first two years. Whereas CUSOM specifically supports the academic and scholarly pursuits of students and faculty, this policy specifically applies to student extracurricular research and s cholarly activities. CUSOM does not require students to complete an extracurricular independent research project or scholarly activity as a requirement for graduation. However, CUSOM is committed to supporting students in pursuing research and extracurricular scholarly opportunities. Whereas students are encouraged to participate in research, students are not permitted to act as a principal investigator (PI). Rather, they must partner with a faculty member or preceptor who takes on the rol e of PI. Furthermore, CUSOM requires all students who are interested in engaging in research to notify the Associate Dean for Research of their intent through the submission of the research notification form . Students receiving mentorship and/or working on a project not associated with CUSOM should make those projects and relationships know n through the research notification form. As such, student researchers are provided with an additional layer of oversight and support in addition to their faculty or p receptor mentor. 8.3 Education in Research Principles Research processes, compliance practices, and principles of responsible conduct in research (RCR) are presented in the Foundations of Medical Practice (FMP) course throughout years one and two. Topic s include general principles of research ethics, statistical methods, project development, human subject protections and the responsibilities of CUSOM students in basic science , educational, and clinical research. Additional education al opportunities in research, scientific method, statistics, and scholarly activities are presented throughout the curriculum and through workshops associated with extracurricular research activities. As active members of a research team, students may be re quired to complete the associated CITI training, if appropriate. 328 If such training is required, the student must provide the Associate Dean of Research with documentation of completion prior to beginning work on the project. Research mentors provide addit ional training specific to the research project. 8.4 Research Opportunities CUSOM students may pursue research and scholarly activities in many areas of individual interest. Faculty mentors in areas of biomedical and clinical research are available to p rovide guidance for student scholarly work. The faculty mentor has overall responsibility for the conduct of research or scholarly activity and is ultimately responsible for obtaining approval from regulatory committees as needed. As such, CUSOM requires that students receive appropriate mentorship while engaging in scholarly endeavors. A faculty member must approve all scholarly activity undertaken by students or if working on a project outside of CUSOM, the student must identify an individual higher -ranking than that of a student who will serve as the project lead and mentor. However, student and faculty investigators may share the responsibility for complying with policies related to research ethics. For a student -initiated project, the student must have a faculty, preceptor, or outside higher -ranking sponsor, who will serve as the project PI and student mentor. The student may prepare the relevant proposals and applications in close cooperation with the mentor. Mentors and students are responsible for conducting their research in accordance with University and institutional affiliates' research policies. Students wishing to earn credit for biomedical research, clinical research or other scholarly activities may enroll in the Research (Independent S tudy) elective during the fourth year. Description of the course requirements are available in the syllabus and elsewhere in this Bulletin. Students participating in the research elective must comply with all appropriate regulatory requirements, which ma y include Institution Review Board approval prior to initiation of the project. Students and their faculty mentors are responsible for knowing which compliance requirements are appropriate. 8.5 Medical Student Summer Research Scholars Program Each year a limited number of 7 -week paid research fellowships are available to CUSOM medical students during the summer between their MS -1 and MS -2 years. Designed to expose students to basic science, clinical, osteopathic manipulative medicine, or simulation med icine research these opportunities allow students to gain valuable experience in research and explore various clinical and biomedical disciplines. Students are incorporated into laboratories or educational settings to work with CUSOM faculty at the medica l campus at CUSOM -affiliated clinical sites, or work on select projects at local institutions. The Scholars Program is designed to help medical students acquire a greater understanding and application of methodologies, which suppo rt healthcare innovation and to envision themselves as physician -scientists. This is a competitive program and accepted s tudents will attend an RCR training workshop, participate in weekly work -in-progress sessions, work on a full -time basis during the summer months and receive a stipend at the conclusion of the summer. All Summer 329 Scholars are encouraged to present their work at a local, regional, or national symposium. 8.6 Student Presentation Processes Students are encouraged to share the results of their research through publication and presentation of their projects. The Associate Dean for Research oversees research publications and scholarly activities of students. Students are required to receive approval from the Associate Dean for Research prior to presentation or publication of any research project conducted while a CUSOM student. For meeting submissions, the final version of the abstract must be submitted and approved by the faculty mentor and/or the project lead, and the Ass ociate Dean for Research. The Associate Dean for Research must review and approve all compliance requirements before submission of the abstract for any scientific meeting. For manuscript submissions (case report, original research, or any other publicati on), the final manuscript draft must be submitted and approved by the Associate Dean for Research prior to submission to any journal for consideration of publication. The faculty mentor and all listed co -authors must review and approve the final poster, presentation or manuscript prior to submission to the Associate Dean for Research for final approval for presentation and/or publication . The author(s) and mentor must be up-to-date on research compliance processes. Failure to adhere to any of these requi rements is considered professional misconduct and will be reported through the appropriate channels for consideration by the APPS Committee as described elsewhere in this Bulletin . 8.7 Research Symposium Campbell University and CUSOM ha ve a tradition of highlighting and showcasing student research interests. Annually, Campbell University hosts the Campbell University Interprofessional Education (IPE) Symposium, which is an adjudicated competition open to students, residents , and faculty. The IPE research symposium is an opportunity for students to see other projects from their fellow students, as well as projects from other healthcare fields.

The owner of a personal machine or device may use that machine at his or her discretion; however, the use of the University network is subject to all of the policies stated in this document including, but not limited to the following: The owner of any device or machine connected to the Campbell network is responsible for the behavior of all users of that machine and for all network traffic to and from the machine. Campbell maintains no responsibility or liability for loss of data or hardware corruption on personal computer systems. A private machine or dev ice connected to the University network may not be used to provide network access to individuals who would not otherwise have access through official Campbell channels. A private machine may not be used to redirect data to other networks, nor may it serve in any way as an electronic gateway to non - University affiliated systems. Private machines or devices may not use the University network for commercial gain or profit. Neither Campbell -owned, private compu ters, or electronic devices may be used to s erve files through any protocol (http, ftp, email , IM, etc.) without appl ication to Information Technology Services for an except ion for scholarly use unless the compu ters are designated ser vers by Information Technology Services. Unless otherwise appro ved in writing, provisions for in teract ive login servi ces for non -University affiliated users a re prohib ited. 340 Should the Univ ersity have reason to believe that a privately owned system is using the n etwork inappropriately, network traffic to and from that system will be monitored and, if justified, the system will be disconn ected, and appropriate puni tive action will be taken. Technology Usage Computer systems and networks allow for a free exchange of scholarly ideas and information. This exchange serves to enhance learning, teaching, critical thinking, and research, as well as to promote the sharing of moral standards. While the constitutional right of free speech applies to communication in all forms, the Christian atmosphere of Campbell University prescri bes only civil and respectful discourse. Campbell University computer and network services are available as a privilege to all full -time and adjunct faculty, staff, and students at the main and extended campuses. The number of people in the Campbell comm unity dependent upon the University's computer and network services is sizable. Therefore, a respect for the needs of others is expected among users. To ensure access and service for all, eligible users must refrain from any action which interferes with normal system operation, such as: Using compu ter or network services for commercial purposes or personal profit Sending excessive email locally or over the network su ch as chain letters, advertisements, or so licitations Knowingly installing or running a program that will d amage or place an undue burden on the s ystem Knowingly acting in a mann er that will disrupt normal operations of computers or the n etwork Using computer or network services in a way that vio lates copyrights, patent protections or license agreement Gaining unauthori zed access to information that is private or protected, or attempting to do so Attempt ing to gain system and/or network privileges to which you are not entitled Using the Univ ersity computer system to disseminate materials that are not in keeping with the purposes of the ins titution The University reserves the right to monitor the use of institutionally owned resources. Alleged inappropriate use of technology resources will be investigated. In instances of misuse, appropriate disciplinary actions, to include legal action, will be taken. Copies of the Acceptable Use Policy are included in official University publications including, but not limited to, the graduate and undergraduate catalogs, staff/faculty/student handbooks , and selected course syllabi. 341 The Acceptable Use Policy is also posted on the University's policy web page .

With the notable exceptions of the processes normally associated with grading, critique, assessment, and lecture or classroom illustrations, no other student, faculty, or staff member may make any use of another's work without the expressed consent of the creator. However, the Department and the University r etain the right to display, copy, replicate, or distribute any work created through the use of the Department's production facilities for the purposes of promotion, representation, artistic display, publication, illustration, and recruiting, on the conditi on that the creator is given full, appropriately disclosed credit. No one, including the creator, may use the Department's production facilities for any commercial purpose. Pornographic or Obscene Material Users are requir ed to use institutional resources in a responsible and respectful manner. Pornographic, obscene, or offensive material is prohibited on the Campbell University computers and network system. The Campbell University Office of Information Technology Services is to be notified of t he transmission of questionable or offensive materials via the institutional computer and network system. Treated as inappropriate use, these allegations will be investigated, and if warranted, appropriate disciplinary actions taken. 342 Electronic Communications The University provides Internet access to all eligible users through campus computing facilities. Electronic mail (email) is also provided to all eligible users. These services are provided only for University -related purposes. Class R ecordings Class materials (hereafter including PowerPoints, Handouts and Lecture Recordings) are distributed for the exclusive use of students in the Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine. Student access to and use of materials are conditioned on agre ement with the terms and conditions set out below. Any student who does not agree to them is prohibited from accessing or making any use of such materials. In a distance -learning environment, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), a feder al privacy law, continues to remain in effect and students need to understand their role in supporting the privacy of fellow students. In courses which incorporate remote interactions, students must be cognizant that shared pictures, written assignments, audio, videos, emails, blog posts, discussion boards, etc. remain part of the content of the course, just as they would if they were shared in the face -to-face classroom setting. The expectation is that each member of the class treats those materials with care and does not reshare or post beyond the course. Accordingly, any student accessing class or other educational materials on Blackboard or any other electronic media: 1. Acknowledges the faculty members' intellectual property rights and that distribution of the materials outside the course participants violates the copyright policy; and 2. Recognizes the privacy rights of fellow students who speak or appear on video in cla ss; and 3. Accepts that recording, distributing, posting, or uploading materials to students or any other third party not authorized to receive them or to those outside the classroom is an Honor Code violation; and 4. Agrees that the materials are to be ac cessed and used only as directed by the faculty member(s) teaching the course. 343 10.
