However, mounting evidence indicates that they can also influence the immune and nervous systems and vice versa. Here we reviewed the bidirectional relationship between the gut microbiota and the brain, termed microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis, and we discuss how it contributes to the pathogenesis of certain disorders, that may involve brain inflammation. Methods\u2014 Articles were chosen from Medline since 1980 using the key words anxiety, attention-deficit hypersensitivity disorder (ADHD), autism, cytokines, depression, gut, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal immune system, microbiota, nervous system, neurologic, conditions, psychiatric, stress. Findings\u2014 afferent or efferent pathways are involved in the MGB axis. Antibiotics, environmental and infectious agents, intestinal neurotransmitters/neuromodulators, sensory vagal fibers, cytokines, essential metabolites, all convey information about the intestinal state to the CNS. Conversely, the HPA axis, the CNS regulatory areas of satiety and neuropeptides released from sensory nerve fibers affect the gut microbiota composition directly or through nutrient Corresponding author: Theoharis C.

Such interactions appear to influence the pathogenesis of a number of disorders in which inflammation is implicated such as mood disorder, autism-spectrum disorders (ASDs), attention-deficit hypersensitivity disorder (ADHD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and obesity. Implications\u2014 Recognition of the relationship between the MGB axis and the neuroimmune systems provides a novel approach for better understanding and management of these disorders. Appropriate preventive measures early in life or corrective measures such as use of psychobiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation and flavonoids are discussed. nervous system MGB Humans have up to 37% gene homology with Bacteria and Archae1. Great numbers of commensal microorganisms reside on both the external and the internal surfaces of our bodies, especially the gut, outnumbering human somatic cells by approximately 10:12. Our colonization starts at birth during vaginal delivery with a maternal signature followed by complex \"adult\" microbiota after the first year of age3, 4. As a result, the human body is considered as a super-complex ecosystem, a social network with the gut microbiota having formed a permanent symbiotic relationship rather than a temporary form of parasitism5. Normally, the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota has a symbiotic relationship with our enteric cells and contributes to basic physiological processes including digestion, growth and self- defense (Table 1). An individual's gut microbiota composition depends on the mode of delivery at birth, genetic predisposition, age, nutrition, physical activity, environmental factors, stress, infections, other diseases and use of antibiotics. Brain function and psychological make-up are now increasingly considered to have a reciprocal relationship with the gut6. Disruption of the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) balance is known to contribute, among others, to the pathogenesis of GI diseases, especially inflammatory bowel disorder (IBD)7 and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)8, especially since the gut microbiome regulates immunity9-13. In fact, bacteria reported to directly induce inflammation and pain14 Accumulating evidence suggests that the gut microbiota maintain bidirectional interactions with critical parts of the central nervous system (CNS) and the immune system through direct and indirect pathways (Table 2 and Fig. 1). These involve the endocrine [hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis], immune (chemokines, cytokines), autonomic systems forming the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis6. Neuro/immune-active substances derived from the intestinal lumen can penetrate the gut mucosa, be transported by blood, cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and affect the CNS15. Gut microbiota can influence CNS function through their ability to synthesize or mimic a range of host-signaling neuroactive molecules, such as acetylcholine (Ach), catecholamines, Petra et al.

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptgamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), histamine, melatonin and 5-hydroxytryptamine regulation of peristalsis or modulation of sensation17. Conversely the composition of gut microbiota is influenced by emotional and physiological stress18. One study found that healthy students during an extremely stressful time had fewer Lactobacilli present in their stool as compared to less stressful periods19. Maternal separation stress between 6-9 months of age in rhesus monkeys resulted in decreased faecal Lactobacilli20. Exposure to chronic stress in adult mice decreased the relative abundance of Bacteroides species and increased the Clostridium species in the caecum; moreover, it caused activation of the immune system as documented by increased IL-6 and CCL2 production21. Acute stress increased GI22, 23 and BBB24 permeability through activation of mast cells (MCs), which express high affinity receptors for CRH25. Moreover, chronic stress disrupted the intestinal barrier through MC activation and permitted penetration of luminal antigens, microflora metabolites, toxins and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the systemic circulation and the CNS26. In fact, stress-induced MC activation has been implicated in functional GI diseases27. Maternal separation stress in mice also increased intestinal MC- neuron communication28. MCs communicate with pathogens29 and have been invoked as key modulatory cells in innate immunity30, as well as in inflammation31-34 and autoimmunity35. A new finding concerning MCs is their ability to secrete mitochondrial components, including DNA, extracellularly36. These components are then misconstrued by the body as \"innate pathogens\" and induce a strong auto-inflammatory response36 leading to inflammation and neuronal damage37. The microbiota can also modulate the immune system through other mechanisms38 And the increased use of antibiotics results in depletion of microbiota-derived metabolites, impairs immune homeostasis and contributes to chronic inflammation39. Mood disorders Genes involved in synapse formation between neurons in the brain and neurons in the GI tract are quite similar, and any mutations could possibly lead to both brain and GI abnormalities40. Recent studies analyzing the human genome in brains from diseased individuals with psychiatric disorders reported only two clusters of affected genes with: (a) increased inflammation and (b) decreased mitochondrial function41. Depression is associated with increased inflammatory biomarkers, such as interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- , and C reactive protein (CRP)42. Schizophrenia has been linked to intestinal inflammation43 and gastrojejunal ulcers44. \"Psychobiotics\", which are live organisms, when ingested may produce health benefits in patients suffering from mood disorders45. In a study of 124 healthy volunteers (mean age 61.8 years), those who consumed a mix of specific psychobiotics (Lactobacillus helveticus and bifidobacterium longum) exhibited less anxiety and depression19. Symptoms of \"depression\" were reported to decrease following probiotic treatment in the rat46. Additional studies showed beneficial effects of probiotics in animal models with altered behavioral phenotypes, as they reduced vagal-dependent activation of GABA receptors in response to physical and psychological stress46-51.Petra et al. Page 3 Clin Ther . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 May 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptStudies in animals showed that certain bacterial species could reduce mood changes. For inastance, when Citrobacter rodentium was administrated orally to CF-1 mice, there was an increase in anxious-like behavior 7-8 hours following the infection, through activation of vagal pathways52. Postnatal colonization of germ-free (GF) mice by orally feeding them with different probiotics programmed the HPA for a stress response; for instance, when Campylobacter jejuni was given orally, it increased anxious-like behavior 7 hours after the infection53. Furthermore, a corresponding increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus and amygdala was evident and was eliminated after administration of antibiotic therapy in the mice53. Of note, BDNF is involved in the pathology of depression54 and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs)55, while it is also considered a biomarker for gastric hypersensitivity56. Attention-Deficit Hypersensitivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by lack of attention, impulsiveness and hyperactivity. Its cause is considered multifactorial, involving genetic pre-disposition, somatic mutations, epigenetic changes, perinatal factors (e.g. low birth weight, prematurity and prenatal exposure to alcohol and/or smoke), as well as environmental and socioeconomic factors57. Increasing evidence from clinical and epidemiological studies suggests that children and adults with food allergies, eczema or asthma are associated with behavioral problems and neuropsychiatric disorders, including ADHD58-63. The gut microbiota are known to participate in susceptibility to allergies64, 65, especially food allergens66. One meta-analysis reported that the Kaiser-Permanente (K-P) diet using elimination of salicylates, artificial food colors (AFC) and flavors, as well as the preservative butylated hydroxytoluene, could decrease the hyperactivity of ADHD children57. Children with ADHD were substantially improved on either an AFC-free diet67, or by dietary supplementations with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), iron and zinc68. In fact, PUFA levels in plasma of ADHD children were reported low69. Food-based treatments in children with allergic disorders significantly reduced ADHD-like behavior70. Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social interactions and communication, along with repetitive and stereotyped behaviors71. Many children with ASDs present with GI symptoms72-74 and altered GI flora71. Increasing evidence indicates that ASD pathogenesis may involve brain inflammation75 especially activation of microglia76, 77. Moreover, about 30% of children with ASDs have auto- antibodies against brain proteins78 and the presence of such antibodies strongly correlated with allergic symptoms79. We recently showed that levels of the neuropeptide neurotensin (NT), found both in the brain and the gut and CRH were increased in the serum of children with ASDs; moreover, NT was significantly correlated with the presence of GI symptoms80. We also reported elevated levels of mitochondrial DNA in the serum of children with ASDs81 and CRH Petra et al. Page 4 Clin Ther . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 May 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptaugmented the stimulatory effect of mitochondrial DNA on MCs82. A paper recently reported increased amount of mitochondrial DNA in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with ASDs83. Extracellular mitochondrial DNA could derive either from MCs, PBMC, intestinal cells or bacteria and is misconstrued as \"innate pathogens\" leading to auto-inflammatory reactions84. About 30% of ASD children are characterized by hyperserotonemia85 and a serotonin re- uptake transporter (SERT) gene mutation (SERT Ala56) was identified in some ASD children with hyperserotenemia86. Introduction of this mutation in mice resulted in communication delays and repetitive behaviors similar to those in children with ASDs86. In fact, 5-HT can affect the immune system28, and autoimmune neuroinflammation was treated with a tryptophan metabolite87. The SERT Ala56 mice were also constipated and had bacterial intestinal overgrowth similar to what is often seen in children with ASDs88. Increased intestinal permeability would permit bacterial products, cytokines and chemokines to enter the circulation and cross the BBB89 influencing brain and behavior. For example, children with ASDs had higher levels of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM) against cow's milk-derived allergens, and milk intake by these patients significantly worsened some of their behavioral symptoms70. Elimination of caseinomorphin, gliadomorphin, colorings, sweeteners and preservatives led to significant benefit70. The gut microbiota composition appears to differ between healthy children and those with ASDs71. For example, there was a higher prevalence of Bifidobacteria in healthy controls as compared to ASD patients90. In contrast, Bacteroides vulgatus and Desulfovibrio species were more commonly found in stools of ASDs children; however, only D. desulfuricans, D. fairfielddensis and D. piger were associated with regressive ASD. Clostridium species were increased at the expense of Bifidobacterium in ASD children with food allergies and pediatric IBD as compared to sex- matched controls children91. ASD children treated with oral vancomycin had significant improvement in behavioral, cognitive and GI symptoms92. Such findings are discussed in detail in another manuscript in this issue. Such findings have led to the gut-to-brain connections being proposed as target for treatment of ASDs93. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) Multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease characterized by progressive demyelination and deterioration of neurological function94, 95. It has been suggested that gut microbiota may contribute to the pathogenesis of MS96. One study showed that germ-free mice had delayed induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), probably due to the attenuation of Th17 and auto-reactive B cell responses96. In another study, mice genetically predisposed to develop EAE spontaneously did not develop EAE when housed under germ-free conditions; however, this was reversed upon colonization with conventional microbiota in adulthood97. Even the presence of commensal microbiota promoted the induction of EAE in germ-free B6 mice due to decreased IFN- and IL-17 responses98. et al. Page 5 Clin Ther . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 May 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptHigh-fat diet was found to increase EAE severity in mice, while caloric restriction attenuated EAE symptoms99. Patients with NMO have aquaporin (AQP) autoantibodies (AQP4-seropositive) against the optic nerve and spinal cord, but also more antibodies against GI antigens than healthy controls100. Specifically, 37% of these patients had increased levels of antibodies at least against one of the following: gliadin, tissue transglutaminase (tTG), intrinsic factor (IF), parietal cells (PC) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae compared to 8% of healthy controls, with anti-gliadin and ASCA being the most frequent in AQP4-seropositive NMO (P=0.01 and P<0.05, respectively100. In addition, the AQP4-specific T-cells in NMO patients showed cross-reactivity to a protein of Clostridium perfrigens , supporting a molecular mimicry process in NMO pathogenesis101. MS102 and EAE103 are precipitated or worsen by stress, which is known to also affect the gut104. In fact, stress-induced gut alterations can impact the brain and behavior105. 5. Obesity Obesity has been called a psychiatric disease106 and is associated with depression107 and other neuropsychiatric disorders43Adipocytokines can influence both the brain and the gut106. Recent evidence suggests that gut microbiota influence energy balance and weight68. Increased energy harvesting from diet, regulation of biologically active fatty acid tissue composition, chronic low-grade endotoxemia and modulation of gut-derived peptide secretion are some of the proposed routes that link gut microbiota with obesity108. Gut microbiota may also contribute to low-grade inflammation in obesity109. Increased fat intake has been associated with increased serum levels of LPS in normal humans110 and mice111. This endotoxin can potentially trigger toll-like receptors (TLRs) in adipose or on pancreatic -cells, contributing to both insulin resistance and -cell damage112, 113. Experimental endotoxemia induced adipose inflammation and insulin resistance in lean human subjects114. Modulation of gut microbiota by using probiotics in obese mice was found to decrease high-fat-diet-induced LPS endotoxemia, as well as systemic and liver inflammation111, 112. There are many studies with contradictory results concerning the types of bacteria that predominate in obese as compared to lean individuals115-117. For instance, metabolically obese mice with mutated leptin gene had different microbiota than mice without the mutation115. The same researchers later reported altered gut microbiota composition (reduction of Bacteroidetes and increase of Firmicute phyla ) in obese human subjects compared to lean human subjects118. In contrast, other authors reported higher proportion of Bacteroidetes in overweight and obese subjects119. These conflicting results may be due to the variable methods of analysis and to the different profile of subjects. Gut microbiota can convert undigested carbohydrates into short-chain-fatty acids (SCFA), like acetate, propionate and butyrate. These SCFAs are able to bind and activate two G- protein-coupled receptors (GPR41 and GPR43) on gut epithelial cells, leading secretion petide (PYY), which suppresses gut intestinal is interesting that propionate could induce an autistic-like phenotype in rats120.Petra et al. 6 Clin Ther . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 May 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptModulation of gut microbiota may have therapeutic potential in the management of metabolic disorders121. Treatment and Future Directions Therapeutic modulation of gut microbiota possibly by the use of pPre- and probiotics may be helpful in disorders involving MGB axis disturbances122. Prebiotics can benefit both intestinal mucosa and systemic immunity as they reach the large intestine non-hydrolyzed and stimulate the growth of beneficial intestinal microbiota123. Probiotics could restore intestinal permeability by improving mucosal barrier function124. Administration of different probiotics has been reported to be beneficial in humans with abdominal pain125, 126 and increased the pain threshold in rats127. Lactobacillus acidophilus induced the expression of the cannabinoid 2 and -opioid 1 receptors in the colonic epithelium128, while Lactobacillus farciminis inhibited stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity129. However, use of probiotics may result in both beneficial and detrimental effects. For example, there were beneficial effects in IBS with the use of probiotics Bifidobacterium infantis 35624130, coli (DSM 17252) and Enterococcus the contrary, use mixtures, such as Lactobacillus plantarum MF1298138 had negative effects in IBS. Non-absorbable antibiotics (e.g. oral rifaximin) was shown to be beneficial in IBS139. Natural flavonoids may be useful because they have immunoregulatory actions140. For instance, the quercetin glycoside rutin is cleaved gut bacteria has anti-inflammatory actions141. Both quercetin, luteolin and potent inhibitors of MCs142. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from a healthy donor can re-establish intestinal flora balance and could be used for specific GI diseaseS143, especially the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection144 and possibly be efficacious in IBD145.
