According to yogic philosophy, the [third eye](https://lonerwolf.com/how-to-open-your-third-eye/) is connected to [duality](https://lonerwolf.com/non-duality/) which is a type of perception that opposes reality and is created solely by the mind. Once the third eye chakra is in harmony with the rest of the chakras, it is said that a doorway towards [spiritual enlightenment](https://lonerwolf.com/spiritual-enlightenment/) is opened. When our third eye chakra is clean and balanced, we see life with clarity and possess strong intuition, insight, [self-awareness](https://lonerwolf.com/self-awareness/), and emotional balance. On the other hand, when our third eye chakra is blocked or imbalanced, we tend to struggle with problems such as closed-mindedness, cynicism, anxiety, depression, paranoia, and various other mental illnesses and mood disorders. If you think you might have a blocked third eye chakra, think back to your childhood. Were you raised in a closed-minded family? Was freethinking encouraged in your childhood, or were you conditioned to \"obey without questioning\"? Was your early life environment emotionally stable? Did you parents or caretakers value your insights and perspectives? If not, you probably struggle with third eye chakra issues as a result of your childhood conditioning. Don't worry, this guide will help you initiate your own unique process of third eye chakra healing. Table of contents What is the Third Eye Chakra? The third eye chakra, or Ajna, is the energy center within our bodies that is responsible for intuition, imagination, thought, and self-awareness. Located in the middle of the forehead just above the eyes, the third eye chakra is associated with the color indigo and the pineal gland within the brain. This chakra helps to regulate the energy associated with insight and wisdom. What is Third Eye Chakra Healing? Third eye chakra healing is the practice of cleansing, opening, and balancing the third eye chakra within our bodies. Third eye chakra healing employs a wide range of holistic healing remedies to bring alignment to the body, mind, and spirit. These remedies include practices such as meditation, mindfulness, color therapy, sound healing, yoga, [self-inquiry](https://lonerwolf.com/self-inquiry/), aromatherapy, and many others. 24 Signs of an Unhealthy Third Eye Chakra The best way to tell whether you need to undergo third eye chakra healing is to pay attention to your thoughts, feelings, actions, and physical sensations within your body. Here are some signs to look out for: - You rarely feel creative or inspired by anything - You ignore listening to your [intuition](https://lonerwolf.com/how-to-trust-your-intuition/) - You are overly logical or overly emotional - You become absorbed by the details but struggle to see the \"bigger picture\" - You're often lost in your thoughts - You habitually escape into daydreaming to avoid reality - You are egotistically attached to special \"powers\" (ability to see visions, clairsentience, etc.) - You are emotionally reactive and get upset easily - You're addicted to external things which you believe will make you happy (relationships, food, sex, money, status, shopping, etc.) - You struggle to see reality clearly (see [mental distortions](https://lonerwolf.com/anxiety-and-depression/)) - You can't seem to connect to your deeper self or Soul - Your interactions with other people are very trivial or superficial - You mistrust or dislike people easily - You have rigid opinions about the world that you aren't willing to change - You are stubborn - You find it hard to be open-minded - You might be perceived as arrogant and opinionated, OR ... - You might be perceived as being dreamy and ungrounded - You suffer from frequent headaches or migraines - You have a dense and heavy [ego](https://lonerwolf.com/what-is-the-ego/) - You're strongly attached to outcomes - You lack focus and decisiveness - You suffer from vision problems and sinus issues - You suffer from delusions/mental illness How many of these signs can you relate to? Do You Have a Deficient or Excessive Third Eye Chakra Blockage? Did you know that there are actually [two types](http://anodeajudith.com/excess-and-deficiency-in-the-chakras/) of chakra imbalances? While a deficient third eye chakra is passive or energetically \"numb,\" an excessive third eye chakra is energetically aggressive or manic. Here's a breakdown of the difference between the two: Deficient = lifeless, sluggish, passive, blocked, inwards (not enough energy flows in). Excessive = lively, agitated, reactive, aggressive, outwards (too much energy flows in). Therefore, if you have a deficient third eye chakra, you will be more prone to issues such as dreaminess, ungroundedness, and mental confusion. On the other hand, if you have an excessive third eye chakra you will be prone to narrow-mindedness, cynicism, and arrogance. The question is, what type of imbalance do you have? It's also possible to fall somewhere in the middle. 22 Third Eye Chakra Healing Practices So what does a healthy and balanced third eye chakra look and feel like? When you have a clear and harmonious third eye chakra, you are calm, self-aware, and possess foresight. You are not controlled or limited by the mind, and you find it easy to distinguish truth from illusion. You will also be much more insightful and understanding of yourself, other people, and life in general. Intuition will flow effortlessly to you as you make wise decisions that are grounded in reality, not fantasy. Once you have opened and balanced your third eye, you will also find it easier to be objective and less fixated on your limited beliefs. As a result, life will take on a more fluid and vibrant quality which will help you to be more creative and spontaneous. You will be able to see life from a bird's eye view which will give you wisdom and compassion. Spiritually speaking, you will be able to access mystical states of being much more easily, such as the feeling of timelessness and boundlessness that comes with [ego death](https://lonerwolf.com/ego-death/). Some people even report developing gifts such as clairvoyance after working on this energy center. This all sounds very exciting, doesn't it! But please understand that chakra healing can take time because it is a process of inner growth. Sometimes many things within us have to change before we seek the clarity we've been looking for. So be prepared to make changes and keep an open heart. Here are twenty-two third eye chakra healing practices out there which will help you balance this energy center: 1. Explore different perspectives and viewpoints Best suited to: excessive blockages One big problem associated with a blocked third eye chakra is being rigid and closed-minded. To overcome this problem, try reading books, watching new programs or experimenting with [activities](https://lonerwolf.com/self-awareness/) outside of your comfort zone. Even if it feels a little weird at first, try to be curious about other perspectives and ways of life. 2. Decalcify your pineal gland Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Your pineal gland is a tiny pea-shaped mass within the brain that is linked to third eye chakra blockages. While the pineal gland is responsible for regulating our sleep cycles and reproductive hormones, it also has more [mystical roots](https://lonerwolf.com/what-is-a-mystic/). Many ancient cultures such as the ancient Tibetan, Egyptian, and Chinese believed that the pineal gland is responsible for spiritual consciousness. To decalcify your pineal gland, try to avoid products and water sources that contain fluoride. 3. Ground yourself with mindfulness Best suited to: deficient blockages Our third eye functions the best when it is [grounded in reality](https://lonerwolf.com/how-to-ground-yourself/). Otherwise, we get lost in fantasy and delusion very easily. Try to [practice being present](https://lonerwolf.com/being-present/) with whatever arises in your daily life. Focusing on your breath helps a lot. 4. Get out into the sunlight Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages As the element of the third eye chakra is light, you might find your mind becoming much clearer if you get outside a bit more. If you live in a dark or cold climate, you might like to try [light therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy) if getting natural sunlight isn't much of an option. On a physical level, light awakens the pineal gland which improves the function of the third eye. 5. Use the following herbs Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Use herbs such as mugwort, star anise, saffron, basil, jasmine, lavender, passionflower, rosemary, and blue lotus. You can diffuse these herbs, burn them as incense, apply them topically (in a diluted form), or consume them. One of the best ways to take herbs is to drink them as tea. For the third eye chakra, I recommend Buddha Teas' soothing and 100% organic Third Eye Chakra Tea [which you can buy here](https://lonerwolf.com/go/thirdeyechakratea/). This tea is infused with the essence of sapphire. 6. Explore your limiting beliefs Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages One major cause of third eye malfunction is limiting core beliefs. Core beliefs are the central convictions we have about ourselves which cause us to feel fear, insecurity, and [self-loathing](https://lonerwolf.com/self-loathing/). Common core beliefs include \"I am not worth it,\" \"I'm a bad person,\" and \"I deserve to be punished.\" By uncovering your hidden core beliefs, you might save yourself from attending years of therapy (not to mention improved mental health). Read more about [core beliefs](https://lonerwolf.com/core-beliefs/). 7. Hum or chant the sound \"OM\" Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages This sound matches the vibration of the third eye chakra. Try drawing out the letters into sounds, such as \"ommmmmmmmmm\" or \"auuuummmmmm.\" You might also like to listen to [binaural beats](https://lonerwolf.com/binaural-beats-meditation/) (a form of music healing therapy) which helps to activate and clear all the chakras through alternating sound waves. [Try these chakra healing songs.](https://lonerwolf.com/go/chakra-healing-binaural-beats/) 8. Go on a psychedelic shamanic journey Best suited to: excessive blockages Under the guidance of a trained [shaman](https://lonerwolf.com/shaman-signs/) or spiritual guide, try a sacred form of [plant medicine](https://lonerwolf.com/legal-psychedelics/) such as peyote, ayahuasca or psilocybin mushrooms. These sacred plants help to open the third eye and balance the entire energy system. Often, during these sacred trips, many great and profound truths are revealed. 9. Eat more of these foods Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Introduce more of the following fruit and vegetables into your diet which all resonate with the third eye chakra: prunes, dates, blackberries, blueberries, figs, raisins, eggplant, purple cabbage, purple kale, purple carrots, and purple potatoes. 10. Contact the owl spirit guide Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages The owl is the symbolic and totemic animal of the third eye chakra. In order to contact Owl, think about what you need help the most with. You may contact this [spirit guide](https://lonerwolf.com/spirit-guides/) through self-induced trance states, meditation, visualization or [prayer](https://lonerwolf.com/the-power-of-prayer/). 11. Reflect on all that you think and do Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Self-reflection is an important skill to develop, and it helps to increase your self-awareness. Try reflecting on your thoughts and feelings in a [private journal](https://lonerwolf.com/how-to-journal/) each day. Try to dissect why you believe certain things and behave in various ways. 12. Try star-gazing and moon-gazing Best suited to: excessive blockages Gazing into the night sky is a simple but awe-inspiring way to put everything in perspective. Staring at the moon and stars tends to open the mind and help you to transcend the cage of thought. 13. Use essential oils Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Use oils [clary sage](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QMVK4MK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?tag=lonerwolf-20), [sandalwood](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SVF0JNO/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?tag=lonerwolf-20), [juniper](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PX9BDOK?tag=lonerwolf-20), and [vetiver](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PJ5W8XS/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?tag=lonerwolf-20). You can put these oils into an oil diffuser, rub them on your wrist (in a diluted form), or wear them in a [diffusing pendant](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016K52S7Q/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?tag=lonerwolf-20). 14. Become an observer of your thoughts Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Try Vipassana meditation, which is a type of meditation that involves learning how to watch your mind, and observe your thoughts. The number one reason why the third eye chakra gets blocked is that we believe the thoughts in our head and therefore identify with them. When we learn how to simply observe our thoughts, we can discover that thoughts are very temporary and spontaneous: they don't mean anything about us unless we assign them meaning. 15. Do a third eye chakra visualization Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Imagine a throbbing or swirling ball of luminescent indigo light in your third chakra area. Feel the ball of indigo energy dissolving all blockages, sluggishness, or aggressive flows of energy within you. You might also like to try the [violet flame meditation](https://lonerwolf.com/violet-flame-meditation/), which is a powerful way to enhance your spiritual awareness. 16. Practice scrying Best suited to: excessive blockages Scrying is an ancient art of revelation. Traditionally, scrying has been portrayed through the popular image of the psychic woman gazing into her crystal ball. However, scrying can be used with bowls of water, mirrors, and other objects. Scrying is essentially a practice that helps you to develop your inner vision or \"second sight.\" Read this step-by-step guide on [scrying ](https://lonerwolf.com/scrying/)(with instructional pictures). 17. Pay attention to your dreams Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Your dreams are richly symbolic in nature and express your unconscious fears, desires, and needs. The third eye is responsible for helping you to interpret your dreams, so practice reflecting on your dreams each morning for about ten to fifteen minutes. Remember, dream dictionaries cannot provide you with the precise and nuanced meanings you need. Although it's tempting to use one, see if you can try and discover the meaning carried within your dreams by yourself. Often important lessons and messages are conveyed within the dream world. 18. Use crystals Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Use crystals as energetic totems that will help you balance your third eye chakra energy. Try meditating or carrying crystals such as [shungite](http://www.exquisitecrystals.com/minerals/shungite?acc=093f65e080a295f8076b1c5722a46aa2), [sapphire](http://www.exquisitecrystals.com/minerals/sapphire?acc=093f65e080a295f8076b1c5722a46aa2), [lapis lazuli](https://lonerwolf.com/go/lapislazulicollection/), suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Every day, infuse your mind with supportive and loving affirmations. Try to choose a statement that you sincerely resonate with. Here are a few examples, \"I create my reality,\" \"I trust my intuition,\" \"I see with clarity,\" \"I connect with the wisdom of the universe,\" \"It is safe for me to see the truth,\" \"I trust in myself,\" \"My mind and heart are in perfect balance.\" 20. Harmonize your energy with yoga Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Balance your third eye chakra by doing yoga stretches such as standing forward bend (uttanasana), dolphin pose, child's pose, and head-to-knee pose (janu sirsasana). 21. Wear indigo! Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Wearing and surrounding yourself with the color indigo is a wonderfully simple way to stimulate your third eye chakra. 22. Candle gazing Best suited to: deficient and excessive blockages Candle gazing, also called [Trataka](http://www.yogaindailylife.org/system/en/hatha-yoga-kriyas/trataka) in Hatha Yoga, is a powerful way to open your third eye by simply looking into the flame of a candle. Try to incorporate mindful breathing into this practice to stimulate energy flow within your body. Light a candle and place it three to four feet in front of you at eye level. Keep your vision focused on the flame in a gentle and natural way.
