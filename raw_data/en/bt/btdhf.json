Because the Catalogue must be prepared well in advance of the year it covers, changes in some programs inevitably will occur. Courses described in the Catalogue are subject to change without notice, and some listed courses are not offered each year. The quarterly Schedule of Classes, a pub\u00ad lication available from the Registrar's Office shortly before enrollment begins each quarter, provides information on classes to be offered, instructors, enrollment restrictions (for example, major only), class hours, room assignments, and examination schedules. Students should consult the appropriate academic unit for current information. Admis\u00ad sion to UCI does not guarantee admission to any particular course. Course Listings. Undergraduate courses are classified as \"lower division\" and \"upper \"upper division\" refers to courses numbered 100-199. Courses numbered 200 and above are graduate courses. \"Lower division\" usually refers to freshman-sophomore courses, \"upper division\" to junior\u00ad senior courses. However, junior and senior students may take lower-division courses, and freshmen and sophomores may normally take upper-division courses when upper\u00ad division standing is not a prerequisite. Prerequisites for courses should be noted carefully; a course has no prerequi\u00ad sites unless indicated. Courses with sequential designations (for example, lA-B-C) normally indicate multiple-quarter courses; except as noted, each course in a sequence is prerequisite to the one follow\u00ad ing. The letter L following a course number usually desig\u00ad nates a laboratory course. The \"(4)\" or \"(4-4-4)\" designation following the course title indicates the unit credits toward the 180 quarter units needed to graduate. Each \"4\" represents four quarter units. The letters F, W, or S after the course number and title indi\u00ad cate the quarter(s) in which the course will be offered: fall, winter, or spring. The word Summer appears if the course is offered in Summer Session of the academic year covered by this issue of the UCI General Catalogue. While efforts have been made to provide information on when a course is offered, such information is not always available in time for inclusion in the Catalogue. The designation (4) F, W, S indi\u00ad cates a single course offered each quarter which can be taken only once for credit; a (4-4-4) F, W, S designation indi\u00ad cates that credit may be earned in each quarter. When a course is approved for satisfaction of the UCI breadth requirement, the breadth category is indicated by a roman numeral at the end of the course description. A description of the breadth requirement may be found on page 13.

Second class postage paid at Santa Ana, California.' Price $1.50; by mail $2.00. All announcements herein are subject to revision without notice. INTRODUCTION TO UCI THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA David S. Saxon President The University of California was chartered as the State's only Land Grant College in 1868. Throughout its first decades, the University's development was strongly influ\u00ad enced by leading educators and scholars from various parts of the country. Supported by the State and many generous benefactors, the University was responsive to the needs of California while progressing on a steady climb toward emi\u00ad nence in academic and scientific achievement. Today the University system includes nine campuses\u00ad Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. All of the campuses adhere to the same admissions guidelines and high academic standards, yet each one has its own distinct character. Among the campuses there are five medical schools, three law schools, and a school of veterinary medi\u00ad cine, as well as professional schools of business administra\u00ad tion, education, engineering, oceanography, and many others. The University's libraries are among the finest in the United States. In just over a century, the University has become one of the world's largest and most renowned centers of higher educa\u00ad tion. The faculty is internationally noted for its distin\u00ad guished academic achievements. On its nine campuses, the University has a total of 14 Nobel laureates. National Academy of Science membership on all campuses numbers 197-greater than the total for any other college or univer\u00ad sity system. The University maintains a variety of research facilities, agricultural field stations, and extension centers in more than 100 locations throughout California. Public services include medical and dental clinics, information services for agricultural and urban populations, and a broad program of continuing education for adults in the arts, business, and professions. Under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy and with support from other agencies, the University operates three national research facilities: the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory adjoining the Berkeley campus; the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory at Livermore, California; and the Los Alamos National Scientific Laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Other major research facilities include Lick Observatory, White Mountain Research Station for high-altitude research, Laboratory of Radio Astronomy, Bodega Marine Laboratory, Scripps Institution of Oceanog\u00ad raphy, Institute of Transportation Studies, Statewide Air Pollution Research Center, Space Sciences Laboratory, Hormone Research Center, and Philip L. Boyd Deep Canyon Desert Research Center, among others. One of the University's unique resources is its roster of Uni\u00ad versity Professors. The University Professor title is reserved for certain distinguished faculty members who are recog\u00ad nized nationally and internationally as scholars and teachers of exceptional ability. A University Professor may visit a number of University of California campuses during the aca\u00ad demic year, holding conferences with students and staff and speaking before general public audiences. A list of University Professors may be found on page 260. University Administration. Under the State Constitution, governance of the University is entrusted to the Board of Regents. The Regents appoint the President of the Univer\u00ad sity, and with the President's advice, appoint the Chancellors, Directors of major laboratories, Provosts, and Deans who UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Introduction to UCI 5 UC IRVINE - 1982-19836. The Irvine Campus administer the affairs of the individual campuses and other divisions of the University. Authority in academic matters is delegated by The Regents to the Academic Senate, which determines academic policy for the University as a whole. The Board of Regents includes seven ex officio board members, and 18 regular members who are appointed by the Governor for 12-year terms after consultation with an ad\u00ad visory committee. In addition, The Regents appoint a student Regent for a one-year term as a voting Board member with full rights of participation. A constitutional amendment pro\u00ad vides that \"Regents shall be able persons broadly reflective of the economic, -cultural, and social diversity of the State, including ethnic minorities and women.\" They shall have \"full powers of organization and government, subject only to such legislative controls as may be necessary to ensure com\u00ad pliance with the terms of the endowments of the University and the security of its funds.\" The President is executive head of the total institution. Each of the nine campuses has a Chancellor as its chief administra\u00ad tive officer. The Chancellor is responsible for the organiza\u00ad tion and operation of the campus, including academic, stu\u00ad dent, and business affairs. For the names of University Regents, Officers, and Chancellors, see page 259. The Academic Senate, consisting of faculty and certain admin\u00ad istrative officers, determines the conditions for admission arid degrees, subject to the approval of The Regents, authorizes and supervises courses and curricula, and advises the Univer\u00ad sity administration on the important matters of faculty appointments and promotions and budgets. Students participate in policymaking at both the campus and Systemwide levels. THE IRVINE CAMPUS Daniel G. Aldrich, Jr. Chancellor The University of California, Irvine has achieved distinction nationally and internationally because of the high quality of its programs, faculty, and alumni. The campus challenges its students both academically and personally and relies on the commitment, curiosity, imagination, and judgment of faculty and students to assure its continued intellectual and cultural vitality. Since the campus opened in 1965, enrollment has grown to 11,057, including 8,485 undergraduate students, 1,522 graduate students, and 1,050 medical students and res\u00ad idents as of fall 1981. ACADEMIC GOALS The University of California, Irvine offers programs designed to provide students with a foundation on which to continue developing their intellectual, aesthetic, and moral capacities. The programs and curricula are based on the belief that a student's collective University experience should provide understanding and insight which are the basis for an intellec\u00ad tual identity and life-long learning. An important aspect of the educational approach at UCI is the emphasis placed on student involvement in independent study, research, and the creative process as a complement to classroom study. Independent research in laboratories, field study, involvement in writing workshops, and participation in fine arts productions are normal elements of the UCI expe\u00ad rience. In many departments special programs and courses which involve students in original research and creative activ\u00ad ities are integrated into the curriculum. The Irvine campus provides an atmosphere conducive to creative work and scholarship at all levels, to the exploration of the accumulated knowledge of mankind, and to the devel-opment of new knowledge through basic and applied research. Along with these objectives, Irvine has a serious commitment to public service. The campus generates research expertise which may be applied to regional and national social issues, and seeks to provide humanistic under\u00ad standing of the problems of society. ACADEMIC STRUCTURE Instruction and research programs at UCI focus on funda\u00ad mental areas of knowledge, while at the same time provide for interdisciplinary and professional study. Five basic Schools represent five fundamental areas of knowledge: Biological Sciences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences. Programs covering interdisciplinary and profes\u00ad sional studies are offered in the Department of Information and Computer Science, the Program in Social Ecology, the School of Engineering, the Graduate School of Management, and the Office of Teacher Education. The UCI-California Col\u00ad lege of Medicine provides educational programs for medical and health sciences graduate students, medical residents, and practicing physicians. Programs in physical education, recrea\u00ad tion, and intercollegiate athletics are provided by the Department of Physical Education. The Office of Academic Affairs is responsible for all pro\u00ad grams of instruction and research. Matters of educational policy, including approval of programs, courses, and grades, are the responsibility of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate. The Irvine Division is part of the Academic Senate of the University of California. Accreditation The University of California, Irvine is a member of the West\u00ad ern Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). The cam\u00ad pus is fully accredited by the Senior Commission of WASC. This accreditation requires periodic review in accord with WASC policies and standards. In addition, the undergraduate degree program of the Department of Chemistry is accred\u00ad ited by the American Chemical Society; the undergraduate Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering options of the School of Engineering are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology; the M.D. program of the UCI-California College of Medicine is accredited by the Liaison Committee of the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Medical Association; and the credential programs of the Office of Teacher Education are approved by the Commission for Teacher Preparation and Licensing. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION OFFICE The UCI Affirmative Action Office develops and supports programs which promote affirmative action and equal oppor\u00ad tunity in University employment, services, and education for qualified minorities, women, handicapped persons, and Viet\u00ad nam Era veterans. Additionally, the Office implements sys\u00ad tems and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with Titles VI and VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and Title IX of the Educational Amendments to the Act. The Office is responsible for assuring fair and equal treat\u00ad ment in University admissions policies, educational programs and activities, and in both undergraduate and graduate stu\u00ad dent affirmative action programs. The Office also coordinates student affirmative action plans. For further information, contact the UCI Affirmative Action Office, 117 Administra\u00ad tion, (714) 833-5594. THE CAMPUS SETTING UCI's location offers the cultural and economic resources of an urban area along with access to the scenic, recreational UC IRVINE - 1982-1983areas of Southern California. Located 40 miles south of Los Angeles, five miles from the Pacific Ocean, and nestled in 1,510 acres of coastal foothills near Newport Beach, UCI lies amid rapidly growing residential communities and a dynamic national and multinational business and industrial complex that affords many employment opportunities. Even so, the campus remains an oasis of green-a natural arboretum planted with trees and shrubs from all over the world. Adja\u00ad cent to the campus lies UCI's outdoor laboratory, the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve, which is home to a wide variety of migratory and nonmigratory water fowl and other wildlife. The UCI Medical Center, located in the City of Orange on a 33-acre site, is a major teaching hospital for the UCI\u00ad California College of Medicine. A major redevelopment pro\u00ad gram is in progress at the Medical Center and includes the recently opened six-level Medical Center Tower, which pro\u00ad vides space for many of the varied activities at this compre\u00ad hensive health education, service, and research facility. Within a few miles of the campus are major department stores; branches of world-renowned boutiques; dozens of outstanding restaurants, many offering cuisines from a vari\u00ad ety of other countries; and major hotels. Cultural opportuni\u00ad ties include repertory theatres, orchestras, choral groups, dance companies, galleries, and museums. The John Wayne Airport is two miles from campus. Yet, in part, the Irvine area retains some of its traditional character as a beach-although not a sleepy-resort. The Portuguese dory fishing fleet at Newport, one of the last private fleets on the West Coast, comes ashore every morn\u00ad ing and evening to sell the day's catch, and the sun and surf crowd mingle with the art and artisan crowd at Laguna Beach during the summer and winter festivals. The temper\u00ad ate, Mediterranean climate stimulates year-round water\u00ad oriented activities such as windsurfing, sailing, and tidepool\u00ad ing. The spring, summer, fall, and winter find students\u00ad many of whom live in the nearby beach communities of Bal\u00ad boa Island, Balboa Peninsula, and Newport Beach-enjoying the warm sun and gentle sea breezes. Boating enthusiasts set sail in Newport Bay in 14-or 30-foot sailboats or in canoes, available from the UCI Sailing \u00b7Club. Local mountain and desert recreation areas are within easy reach, and the UCI Cooperative Outdoor Program provides low-cost rental equipment for hiking and skiing, \u00b7and instruction for other recreational pursuits. The metropolitan attractions of Los Angeles and San Diego are approximately an hour's drive from the campus. Bus transportation between the campus and major housing areas, shopping centers, and beaches is convenient, and bi\u00ad cycling is popular. Both the campus and the surrounding communities are designed to encourage bicycle traffic, and trails connect UCI to many student housing areas and to the waterfront areas of Newport Beach. INSTRUCTIONAL AND RESEARCH FACILITIES University Library Calvin J. Boyer University Librarian The UCI Library is a component of the extensive University of California Library system, whose libraries contain more than 15 million volumes. These libraries are committed to a resource-sharing plan which will strengthen the resource base and usefulness of UCI's own library system.

UCI MEDICAL CENTER AND COMMUNITY CLINICS The Irvine Campus 9 The UCI Medical Center is a fully accredited general and emergency care hospital located in the City of Orange. UCI\u00ad California College of Medicine faculty and resident physi\u00ad cians are the professional staff for medical services at the Center; a full complement of inpatient and outpatient ser\u00ad vices in virtually all medical specialties is offered. The Medical Center provides the only designated comprehensive emer\u00ad gency service in Orange County; it is also the designated Countywide Level I tertiary trauma referral center. The Center serves as a principal facility for teaching and re\u00ad search programs for medical students. Licensed for 493 beds, the Medical Center currently serves 16,300 inpatient admis\u00ad sions, 133,400 outpatient visits, and 42,300 adult and pedi\u00ad atric emergency visits. The availability of advanced technology and the nationally recognized expertise of members of the staff have made UCI Medical Center a regional referral center for the diagnosis and treatment of many medical problems. For example, a recently acquired artificial pancreas for use in the care of dia\u00ad betic patients is one of just a few in the country. One of the nation's major burn centers, and the only one in Orange County, is located at the Medical Center. UCI Medical Center is also recognized for its programs in high-risk obstetrics and surgical replantation of severed limbs. In addition, it is one of two regional centers for the care of critically ill infants. A major redevelopment program is underway at the Medical Center to provide an enhanced professional, functional, and a more attractive environment for patient care and educational programs. The recently opened six-level Medical Center Tower houses diagnostic radiology services, emergency and trauma facilities, obstetrical facilities, and private and semi\u00ad private patient rooms. The redevelopment program includes plans for renovating existing buildings, removing out-dated structures, and constructing new facilities, including a medi\u00ad cal sciences library. The library is planned as the first com\u00ad ponent of a proposed modular facility system that wiU include buildings for inpatient and outpatient diagnostic services and for instructional and research programs. UCI clinical facilities also include the Community Clinic of Orange County (CCOC) in Santa Ana and the North Orange County Community Clinic (NOCCC) in Anaheim .. Both clinics provide educational experiences and patient ser\u00ad vices in primary care. Important components of UCI's medical education and re\u00ad search programs are also conducted at affiliated hospitals and clinics, in particular, the Veterans Administration Medical Center, Long Beach; Memorial Hospital Medical Center, Long Beach; and Childrens Hospital of Orange County. For further information about University-operated clinical facilities and other facilities associated with the UCI Clinical Services System, see the UCI-California College of Medicine section. UC IRVINE - 1982-198310 The Irvine Campus PROGRAM OF ACADEMIC SUPPORT SERVICES The goal of the Program of Academic Student Support Ser\u00ad vices (PASS) is to help students in their progress toward degrees and assist the,m in acquiring certain basic skills and competencies they will be expected to have in whatever pro\u00ad fessions they choose after graduation. PASS is intended to provide a broad range of academic support services including diagnostic testing, writing assistance, tutoring, and help with learning and study skills techniques. Learning Skills Services The Learning Skills staff offers ongoing classes, workshops, individual counseling, and self-help materials aimed at improving students' reading, writing, and learning skills. Many students who utilize these services wish to refine skills developed in high school or to acquire new skills which will help them achieve their highest potential and take advantage of the opportunities for learning available at UCI. Tutorial Assistance Program The Tutorial Assistance Program (TAP) provides small-group peer tutoring in all major disciplines. Tutoring services not only focus upon the needs of students experiencing difficulty in specific courses but also provide assistance to those who wish to improve existing competencies. The TAP staff works closely with faculty and other staff in an effort to assist stu\u00ad dents to become more confident, to reach their academic goals, and to develop a practice of independent learning.

English (\"Subject A\"). Every undergraduate must demon\u00ad strate upon entrance to the University an acceptable level of ability in English composition. This requirement may be met before entrance by: a. Achieving a grade 5, 4, or 3 in either of the two College Board Advanced Placement Examinations in English; or b. Achieving a score of 600 or better in the College Board English Composition Achievement Test; or c. Completing satisfactorily the California State University English Equivalency Test; or d. Entering the University with credentials from another col\u00ad lege which show the completion of an acceptable one-quarter (four units) or one-semester (three units) course in English composition with a grade of Cor better. NOTE: High school English courses will not satisfy this option. Those students who have not met the Subject A requirement before entrance must attempt to satisfy the requirement dur\u00ad ing their first year of residence in the University. This requirement may be met after entrance by one of the four following means: One is by taking and passing the Subject A Diagnostic Exam\u00ad ination that is given only during the fall quarter Academic Advising and Orientation Week before classes begin. A second option, open only to those enrolled in the Humanities Core Course, is by taking and receiving a grade of P in the Writing Workshop. (NOTE: Students held for Subject A and enrolled in the Humanities Core Course MUST be enrolled in the Writing Workshop.) Third, students scoring from 550 to 600 on the College Board English Composition Achieve\u00ad ment Test may enroll in WR 39A-B or Humanities 15-16 and can satisfy the Subject A requirement through achieving a grade of C-(1. 7) in any quarter of either sequence. Fourth, students scoring below 550 on the College Board English Composition Achievement Test-and who have followed neither of the first two routes described above-can satisfy the Subject A requirement through taking Writing iA and receiving a grade of Pin that course. 2. American History and Institutions. This requirement may be met by one of the following: a. Completion in high school of one year of United States history with grades of Cor better, or one semester of United States history and one semester of United States government with grades of Cor better. b. Receiving a score of 5, 4, or 3 in the Advanced Placement Examination in United States History. c. Receiving a score of 500 or higher in the College Board Achievement Test in American History and Social Studies. d. Presentation of a certificate of completion of the require\u00ad ment at another California institution. e. Completion at another institution of one year of college\u00ad level United States history with grades of Cor better, or one UC IRVINE - 1982-1983course in United States history and one in United States government with grades of Cor better. f. Completion at UCI of one four-unit course in colonial American history and one four-unit course in introduction to political science with grades of Cor better. g. Passing an examination in these subjects. (Students should contact the Undergraduate Study Office, School of Humani\u00ad ties, for further information about the examination.) UCI REQUIREMENTS 3. Credit for 180 quarter units, earned by examination, by other evaluation, or course work. A course normally offers four quarter units of credit. 4. A grade average of at least C (2.0). 5. Candidates for the baccalaureate must attain at least a C (2.0) average in all of the courses required in the major pro\u00ad gram and at least a C (2.0) average in the upper-division courses required in the major program. Higher averages than this may be required only in honors programs. Students who fail to attain a C (2.0) average in courses required in the major program may, at the option of the major unit, be denied the privilege of pursuing a major program in that unit. (In this context, \"the courses required in the major program\" are defined as the courses required for the major and offered by the program of the student's major.) 6. Credit for the last three quarters of work immediately preceding graduation earned in residence on the Irvine cam\u00ad pus (i.e., a minimum of one year full-time attendance at UCI). Exceptions to this rule may be allowed, with prior depart\u00ad mental approval, to students enrolled in the Education Abroad Program. 7. Students enrolled at UCI from their freshman year may elect to meet as graduation requirements (UC, UCI, school, and major requirements) those in effect at the time of entrance\u00b7or those subsequently passed after entrance. Stu\u00ad dents transferring from other collegiate institutions may elect to meet as graduation requirements those in effect at the time of entering the other collegiate institution, those in effect at the time of transfer to UCI, or those subsequently passed. A student who seeks readmission to UCI more than \u00b7 three consecutive quarters after withdrawing from student status must adhere to the graduation requirements in effect at the time of readmission or those subsequently passed. Breadth Requirement 8. The current UCI breadth requirement became effective with new freshmen who entered UCI or any other accredited college in fall term, 1980, and thereafter. Candidates for the bachelor's degree must satisfy the current UCI breadth requirement. The requirement is designed to ensure that UCI graduates will have been exposed to a broad spectrum of fundamental areas of intellectual experience. It is a gradua\u00ad tion requirement and therefore need not be satisfied during only the lower-division years. To satisfy the breadth requirement, three four-unit courses are required in each of the following areas: I. Writing II. Natural Sciences III. Social and Behavioral Sciences IV. Humanistic Inquiry V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, or Computer Science The specific course combinations in each area which may be used by students to satisfy the requirement are listed below. Requirements For a Bachelor's Degree 13 These course combinations were selected to ensure the following: (1) that students, in meeting the requirement, be exposed to subject matter, problems, and techniques which would serve as a first introduction to an academic area and (2) that in meeting the requirement students be exposed to a connected set of courses which provide a coherent experience in that academic area. Only with respect to the lower-division writing requirement is it necessary to pass the first two courses sometime before the student's junior year. It is, of course, a good idea to begin satisfying the breadth requirement as early as possible, as many upper-division courses have as prerequisites courses that may be used to satisfy the breadth requirement. NOTE: In satisfying the breadth requirement, a student may count toward breadth no more than three courses taken within the disci\u00ad pline of the major. For example, a student majoring in Philosophy may count no more than three Philosophy courses toward breadth. I. Writing Requirement. Because of the importance of writ\u00ad ing in every academic discipline, the University is committed to developing the verbal skills of its students at all levels and in all areas. The Writing Requirement expresses this com\u00ad mitment, but the concern for and attention to clear, accurate writing is expected of faculty and students in all courses. The Writing Requirement consists of three courses beyond the Subject A Requirement. Except where otherwise noted below, students must satisfy the Subject A Requirement prior to fulfilling the Writing Requirement. Two of the three courses required must be lower-division courses and normally must be completed prior to the junior year (or in the case of transfer students within the first year of residency). The third course must be an upper-division course, and it must be taken only after the successful comple\u00ad tion of 84 quarter units (achievement of junior status) and completion of the lower-division requirement. Lower-Division Requirement: The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division requirement must be completed with a grade of C-(1.7) or better. Students may select from the courses specified below: I. Writing 39A-B, Expository Writing. 2. Humanities 15-16, Humanities Writing Sequence, taken in conjunction with an associated course as designated in the quarterly Schedule of Classes. During the winter and spring quarters of the 1982-83 academic year, Humanities 15-16 will be associated with such courses as English 28, History 29, and Comparative Literature 50. Students must enroll concur\u00ad rently in the associated course selected. NOTE: Students held for Subject A who have scored between 550 and 600 on the College Board English Composition Achievement Test may enroll in Writing 39A or Humanities 15 (see 1 and 2 above); completion of either course with a grade of at least C-(1.7) will simultaneously fulfill the Subject A Requirement. 3. Any two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core Course, Humanities lA-B-C. Students held for Subject A may begin this option provided they concur\u00ad rently enroll in the Writing Workshop. 4. Students who complete Writing 39A or Humanities 15 with a grade of B (3.0) or better may substitute as the second course of the lower-division Writing Requirement one of the following courses in creative writing, nonfiction, or journal\u00ad ism: Writing 30, 31, 32, or 38. UC IRVINE - 1982-198314 Requirements For a Bachelor's Degree Upper-Division Requirement: The course taken to fulfill the upper-division requirement must be completed with a grade of C (2.0) or better. The requirement may be satisfied by completing any one of the following: 1. Writing I39. 2. An upper-division course in creative writing, nonfiction, or journalism. Such courses frequently have special prerequi\u00ad sites. Students may not use such a course to satisfy the requirement unless they have attained a B or better in both courses taken to satisfy the lower-division Writing Requirement. 3. An upper-division course designated in the quarterly Schedule of Classes as approved for satisfaction of the requirement. 4. By examination (refer to the quarterly Schedule of Classes). Students who fail to attain the required grades in the courses taken in fulfillment of the Writing Requirement should refer to page 48 for further information. II. Natural Sciences. Students must select a three-course sequence from one of the following areas: Biological Sciences: Students may select any three courses from Biological Sciences IA, IB, IC, ID, IE, IF, 80, 8I, 82. Chemistry: IS, I9, 20; I8A, B, C. III. Social and Behavioral Sciences. Students must select three courses from one of the following areas, or two courses from one area plus a third from another area. The first course taken in any area must be an introductory course numbered I-I2. Anthropology and Comparative Culture: Social Sciences IA, 2A\u00ad B-C-D-E, 70A. Economics: Sciences 7, SOQ, SOT, 52A, SSC, 550, E8, E32, 6IE. IV. Humanistic Inquiry. Students must select a three-course sequence from one of the following areas: Arts: Art History 40A-B-C; Art Studio History Humanities IA-B-C; 5-IS-I6; 20, 22, and either 2I or 23. Literature: English and Comparative Literature CL SOA-B-C 6-7-8, French SOA-B-C; Humanities 30A-B-C; Russian 20-30-40; Spanish SOA-B-C. V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, Computer Science. Students must select a three-course sequence from one of the following areas: Computer Science: ICS I, 2, 2L, 3; or IO, I, 2, 2L. Foreign l.Jmguages: 2A-B-C; Spanish 2A-B-C. Linguistics: Linguistics 50 and two courses from Linguistics 110, I20, or Social Sciences SOA; Social Sciences I36B-I53F-ISIL. wgic and and Prior to fall quarter, I980, the UCI breadth requirement was met by students taking courses in three schools outside the school of the major (Schools of Biological Sciences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Physical Sciences, or Social Sciences) or, upon approval of petition to their academic dean, by taking courses in Information and Computer Science, Social Ecology, Engi\u00ad neering, or the Graduate School of Management. Specifically, such students took 24 units in one school outside the major and I2 units in each of two other schools outside the major. Normally a student took six four-unit (standard or full) courses in one school outside the major and three four-unit (standard or full) courses in each of two other schools outside the major (referred to as the UCI 6-3-3 distribution). The requirement did not apply to students majoring in Engineering. All students planning to transfer to UCI should see page 38 for details on fulfilling the UCI breadth requirement. Application for Graduation In order to receive a degree, an undergraduate student should file an Application for Graduation at the appropriate dean's office, preferably during the first quarter of the senior year, but no less than six months before the expected day of graduation. SCHOOL AND DEPARTMENTAL REQUIREMENTS In addition to the University requirements listed above, each undergraduate student must satisfy the degree requirements for the major selected. UCJ, school, and departmental or major requirements may overlap; courses taken to fulfill a school or departmental requirement (e.g., the physics course requirement in the School of Biological Sciences) may also help fulfill the UCI breadth requirement. Information on spe\u00ad cific school and departmental or major degree requirements, as well as courses offered, can be found elsewhere in this Catalogue. The student should have determined an area of concentra\u00ad tion no later than the beginning of the junior year, having made certain that the background and the preparation pre\u00ad requisite to junior and senior work in the major have been accomplished. New and continuing undergraduate students should read the section on Planning an Undergraduate Pro\u00ad gram; transfer students should also read the section on Plan\u00ad ning for Transfer to UCI.

UC IRVINE - 1982-1983PLANNING AN UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Many students select their University major-the field of study which represents their principal academic interest-at the time they fill out their University of California Under\u00ad graduate Application. Some students, however, are not ready to choose a major at the time they apply, and still others may wish to change to a different major after they have enrolled. (Students entering the School of Humanities as freshmen may declare a major in a specific department or program upon entrance. If they do not wish to declare their major as an entering freshman, the next opportunity to do so will be at the end of the sophomore year.) CHOOSING A MAJOR In preparation for choosing a major, students need to famil\u00ad iarize themselves as much as possible with UCI and its many programs. Entering students are exposed to a wide range of areas of study, and it is not unusual for students to become enthusiastic about academic disciplines previously unfamiliar to them. Much depends on initiative-on how fully a student takes advantage of opportunities that come through sugges\u00ad tions for further study and through informal communication with faculty and students. The General Catalogue is a good place to find specific infor\u00ad mation about programs available, requirements for majors, and course offerings. At UCI a number of traditionally separ\u00ad ate academic disciplines have strong interrelationships, so that the academic environment is influenced by a wide range of interactions among disciplines. As a complement to class\u00ad room study, UCI encourages its students to become involved in a variety of educational experiences such as independent study, laboratory research, field study, writing workshops, computing, and fine arts productions. In addition to consulting the Catalogue, students are encour\u00ad aged to talk to academic counselors and faculty advisors about the opportunities which are open to them. They may go to any department in order to learn more about its pro\u00ad grams of study, its requirements for graduation, and possible enrollment limitations. While advisors may not be familiar with all fields, they can suggest ways to investigate other areas of study and be helpful in planning a lower-division program which will keep several options open. All students are expected to choose a major by the beginning of the junior year. It is important to look well ahead to this decision and to think about it carefully during the freshman and sophomore years. When considering possible majors, students need to keep in mind that some major programs require quite specific preliminary study. At the same time, excessive early concentration could reduce a student's options and prevent moving to a major in a different field. Further\u00ad more, courses required for graduation need to be considered. For these reasons, it is desirable for students to plan their programs carefully and thoughtfully, seeking a balance between exposure to a variety of academic areas and comple\u00ad tion of courses which are prerequisite to a major under con\u00ad sideration. A-qualified student interested in two areas of study may graduate with a double major by fulfilling the degree requirements of any two programs. Once a student decides on a major, the actual procedure to formalize the decision is not complicated. A form called the Undergraduate Petition for Change of Major must be com\u00ad pleted whenever a student who has no major is ready to declare one, or whenever a student wishes to change from one major to another. The form is available from academic counselors and the Registrar's Office. Planning an Undergraduate Program 17 UNAFFILIATED (UNDECLARED) STUDENTS Students who enter the University as freshmen or sopho\u00ad mores may be uncertain about which major they should choose and may not feel ready to declare their major until they have been on campus for a while. Such students partici\u00ad pate in the General Studies Advising Program (GSAP) which is administered by the Dean of Undergraduate St.udies. The goal of GSAP is to help students make the best informed and most rational choice of a major that is possible. All students at UCI are expected to choose their\u00b7major by the beginning of their junior year. To make a good decision about what major to declare, the student should.know what programs UCI offers and have some experience with them, have a good knowledge of his or her abilities and interests, have clear educational goals, and have a good sense of his or her vocational goals and of the academic programs at UCI that will provide appropriate prep\u00ad aration for them. In GSAP students receive individualized counseling that helps them explore the variety of course offerings on campus, become more aware of their own inter\u00ad ests and abilities, formulate sound educational goals, and learn how to prepare for possible careers .. ACADEMIC ADVISING At the time of admission every undergraduate student at UCI is assigned for purposes of academic advising to the school or program that corresponds to the student's selection of major or school or to the General Studies Advising Pro\u00ad gram if they have not declared a major. New students are encouraged to arrange appointments with an academic coun-\u00b7 selor as soon as possible after they have been admitted to plan their academic programs. Thus, the optimum time to initiate contact with an academic counselor is before the stu\u00ad dent enrolls in classes. The academic counselor can help the student determine whether classes the student wishes to choose are appropriate to the student's level of preparation, whether the proposed classes fit within the student's educa\u00ad tional goals, and whether the classes will help meet some of the various requirements for graduation. Jl1risdiction over all questions of academic regulations and academic standing rests with the dean or director of the UC IRVINE - 1982-198318 Planning an Undergraduate Program school or program to which a student is assigned for pur\u00ad poses of academic advising. Thus, all requests to add or drop courses, waive or change graduation or other requirements, and change area of academic concentration must be processed through the office of that dean or director. Each academic unit is responsible for maintaining a system which provides academic advising by faculty members. These systems differ among the academic units. In some, all of the faculty serve as advisors; in others, only certain members of the faculty are designated as advisors. In each instance, how\u00ad ever, every student will have a faculty advisor. Responsibility for informing students of the identity of their advisors rests with the dean or director of the appropriate academic unit. This is normally done by letter, but students may obtain information by telephone from the office of the appropriate dean or director (see separate listing). A student may request a change of advisor through the chief academic advisor or the dean of the unit. A change in area of concentration often involves a change in advisor. This will always be the case when the change of concentration is to a different school or program; the new school or program will assign a new ad\u00ad visor and inform the student. In some schools and programs consultation between students and their faculty advisors is mandatory. Students are respon\u00ad sible for knowing the governing regulations of the school or program to which they are assigned for academic advising purposes. Irrespective of whether or not consultation between student and advisor is required, the student is respon\u00ad sible for initialing and maintaining periodic contact with the assigned faculty advisor. An appropriate time for the initial con\u00ad tact is during the week prior to the beginning of the student's first classes at UCI, or earlier at the time of registration if this is possible. Thereafter, consultation between student and advisor at the time of registration for each subsequent quar\u00ad ter is desirable. The actual frequency of these meetings will be determined by the desires of the student, the advisor, and the governing regulations. It is the obligation of the faculty advisor to help the student plan an appropriate program of study and interpret the academic regulations of the campus, but the student is solely responsible for meeting the academic regula\u00ad lions and remaining in good academic standing. In addition to faculty members, academic counselors are available in each unit to assist students with major selection, program planning, and petitions. Also, peer academic advisors (trained upper-division and graduate students) can help stu\u00ad dents plan their programs, select or change majors, and arrange for tutoring as necessary. Besides furnishing counsel on such matters, these advisors dispense general campus information and refer students to the appropriate faculty and staff personnel for assistance with specific problems. In the fall, each new student is required to go to the appro\u00ad priate academic dean's office prior to the beginning of classes during Academic Advising and Orientation Week for advice concerning class enrollment and to pick up a Class Verifica\u00ad tion and Identification Card. These plans for new students and provisions for continuing students are explained in detail in the quarterly Schedule of Classes. Advising Personnel Biological Sciences Grover C.

PREPARATION FOR GRADUATE OR PROFESSIONAL ought to keep the possibility of future graduate or professional study in mind as they plan their academic programs, and they should discuss their career goals with their advisors. Students who have an idea of the direction in which they would like to go should familiarize themselves with the basic requirements for postbaccalaureate study and keep those requirements in mind when selecting courses. Further, students should supplement their under\u00ad graduate programs by anticipating foreign language require\u00ad ments at major graduate schools and by intensive work in areas outside their major that are of special relevance to their intended graduate work. For information about graduate or professional study in a given field, students may consult the graduate advisor or an academic counselor in the academic unit corresponding to the area of interest. Also, the Career Planning and Placement Center frequently sponsors seminars on specific career areas and offers a number of services useful to those considering graduate or professional study. PART-TIME STUDY UCI offers several possibilities to pursue part-tiine study for credit leading to an undergraduate or graduate degree. Part\u00ad time study opportunities are available in academic units in which there exists good educational reason, as determined by the academic unit, to allow part-time study. The same admis\u00ad sions standards that apply to full-time students apply to part\u00ad time students. Under University policy, academic deans (the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, for graduate stu\u00ad dents) may approve Petitions for Part-Time Status for reasons of occupation, family responsibilities, or health. In approved part-.time status, one-half of the Educational Fee and one-half of the Nonresident Tuition (if applicable) are assessed. Undergraduate petitions are available from aca\u00ad demic counselors or the Registrar's office; graduate students may obtain further information and petitions from the Divi\u00ad sion of Graduate Studies and Research. Since there are cer\u00ad tain restrictions on receiving undergraduate credit for part\u00ad time course work, undergraduates interested in part-time study should read the Admissions and Fees, Expenses, and Financial Aid sections of the General Catalogue. Graduate students should refer to the Graduate Studies and Research section. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983GRADUATE STUDIES AND RESEARCH Jaime E. Rodriguez Dean Graduate education and research, two major areas of respon\u00ad sibility of the Division of Graduate Studies and Research, are vital and integral parts of academic life at UCI. Programs leading to doctoral or master's degrees are offered in over 35 academic and professional areas. Many of UCI's graduate programs and research activities have achieved national repu\u00ad tations for excellence, and several are internationally recog\u00ad nized as leaders in their respective fields. UCI graduate pro\u00ad grams continue to grow and to evolve in directions that are consistent with the University's teaching, research, and pub\u00ad lic service missions. Graduate study at UCI provides the excitement and satisfaction that spring from the discovery and dissemination of new knowledge, as well as from meet\u00ad ing new challenges. The Dean of Graduate Studies and Research has general ad\u00ad ministrative responsibility for graduate education and research. Graduate education responsibilities include admis\u00ad sions, enrolled-student actions and advising, degree awards, fellowship and assistantship administration, Teaching As\u00ad sistant training, and the Graduate and Professional Oppor\u00ad tunity Program, which facilitates the involvement of minor\u00ad ity students and women in graduate education. In the area of research, the Graduate Dean has responsibility for the administration of extramurally funded training grants, gen\u00ad eral research administration, and research policy develop\u00ad ment and implementation. The Division of Graduate Studies and Research also is ad\u00ad ministratively responsible for Organized Research Units, Focused Research Programs, the Office of Contracts and Grants Administration, and other campus research activities. The following sections describe areas of graduate education and research, and include information about academic regula\u00ad tions and policies important to applicants and graduate students. GRADUATE EDUCATION With the exception of programs conducted by the UCI\u00ad California College of Medicine for the training of medical professionals, the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research administers graduate education, in accordance with academic policies established by the Academic Senate and by the Grad\u00ad uate Council, a standing committee of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate. There is no separate graduate faculty at UCI; graduate work is supervised by academic units and faculties which have concurrent responsibility for under\u00ad graduate studies. A great deal of information about graduate education at UCI is published in the UCI General Catalogue and in the annual Graduate Study Announcement. The staff of the Division Office is ready to help answer questions about admission, academic policies and procedures, graduate programs and degrees, financial assistance, student services, and other mat\u00ad ters of concern to applicants or graduate students. Through the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Pro\u00ad gram (GPOP), positive steps are being taken to increase the participation of minorities, and women in certain fields, in the graduate academic and professional programs of the Uni\u00ad versity. Appropriate assistance is offered during the admis\u00ad sion process, and every effort is made through GPOP advis\u00ad ing and support to ensure that all students will have a rea\u00ad sonable chance to attain their academic objectives. UCI does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, age, handicap, or marital status. ADMISSION TO GRADUATE STANDING Applicants for admission to graduate study at UCI must apply for acceptance into a specific graduate program to work toward an advanced degree. A general requirement for admission is that the applicant hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts, Letters, Philosophy, or Science (or an acceptable equiv\u00ad alent) from a recognized academic institution. A grade point average of at least B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) or better normally is required. Applicants for programs leading to M.A., M.S., or Ph.D. degrees must submit scores from the Graduate Record Examination Aptitude Test; for M.B.A., M.P.A., M.B.P.A., or Ph.D. degree applicants the Graduate Management Admis\u00ad sion Test (GMAT) is preferred by the Graduate School of Management. Most graduate programs have additional admission requirements. Each applicant's file is evaluated by the admissions committee of the specific graduate program and by the Graduate Dean on the basis of such factors as academic subject preparation, scholarship, letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, and examples of previous work. A criti\u00ad cal question is whether the applicant's academic objectives can reasonably be satisfied by the graduate programs on this campus. The University of California does not have the capacity to accommodate all applicants who meet the min\u00ad imum admission requirements. Prospective graduate students are encouraged to assess the professional placement opportunities that are anticipated in the field of interest. It is generally recognized that the number of traditional academic appointments in certain disci\u00ad plines is limited. There are, however, other attractive career options, many of them as yet unrecognized, for highly moti\u00ad vated men and women who demonstrate intellectual strength, integrity, and discipline in earning an advanced degree from a respected university. UCI is committed to help\u00ad ing graduate students develop, in addition to their academic training, the communication and problem-solving skills that also may be critical to future careers. HOW TO APPLY Application forms and the annual Graduate Study An\u00ad nouncement giving application deadlines for each program are available from the Division of Graduate Studies and Research, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717. For fall quarter admission, application by February 1 is required by some programs and strongly encouraged for all others. Some academic units will accept applications for win\u00ad ter or spring quarter admission, for which the deadlines are October 15 and January 15, respectively. Two complete sets of official records covering all postsecondary academic work attempted, regardless of length of attendance, are required. A summary of credit transferred and recorded on the transcript issued by the institution granting the degree will not suffice, except in the case of graduates of the University of Califor\u00ad nia. Records must include official evidence of all college-level degrees conferred. To be official, record copies must bear the Registrar's signature and the seal of the issuing institution, and should be sent directly from the Registrar to the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. University of California transcripts also must be requested by applicants, including those who are UCI undergraduates. Until a complete official academic record including certification of degrees awarded has been received, final admission and registration will not be granted. One set of transcripts and all other credentials is retained by the Division and may not be withdrawn by appli\u00ad cants or students for any purpose. The second set is for\u00ad warded to the appropriate academic unit, retained there, and may be used by the student in conferring with faculty ad- UC IRVINE - 1982-1983visors. Three letters of recommendation are required. Letters from professors or instructors in disciplines related to the proposed course of study are preferred. The application must be accompanied by a $25 Application Fee in the form of a check, draft, or money order for the exact amount made payable to Regents-UC. The Application Fee is nonrefundable. In order for the applicant to receive full consideration, it is necessary that letters and official tran\u00ad scripts be received before the published deadlines. Where students have work in progress at the deadline dates, final transcripts covering such work must be received before a provisionally admitted student is officially enrolled. A formal notice of the admission decision is sent to each applicant by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research as soon as possible after the application and complete records are received, and after the department has made a recom\u00ad mendation. All applicants are advised to await this official notification of admission before making definite plans or arrangements for attending UCI. Admission of Foreign Students Foreign applicants are subject to the standard admission requirements and must provide satisfactory evidence of financial support in order to obtain necessary visa docu\u00ad ments. Since it normally takes much longer to obtain creden\u00ad tials and process foreign applications, foreign students are urged to apply at least six months prior to the deadline dates. All foreign applicants, except those from countries where English is the primary language, must take the TOEFL Exam\u00ad ination (Test of English as a Foreign Language). Ordinarily a score of 550 or better is required. Upon admission and prior to the first day of instruction, the spoken and written English communication skills of a student who has not attained a TOEFL score of at least 600 or who is being considered for appointment as a teaching assistant or reader will be evalu\u00ad ated. The primary purpose of this policy is to identify poten\u00ad tial communication problems and to recommend an appro\u00ad priate program for the development of language skills. LIMITED STATUS Under certain conditions, students holding a bachelor's degree are admitted to Limited Status in order to pursue a specific graduate degree or to prepare for admission to a graduate or professional program by enrolling for a pre\u00ad scribed set of courses (usually undergraduate courses). The general requirements for admission to Limited Status are the same as those for graduate admission, with the exception that Graduate Record Examination scores are not required. Admission to Limited Status is ordinarily for a period of three quarters (one academic year) and does not imply admis\u00ad sion to a UCI graduate degree program at some later date. Although Limited Status does not represent graduate stand\u00ad ing, the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research may offer admission upon the recommendation of an academic unit which has agreed to oversee the student's program. Limited Status students may enroll in graduate courses with the permission of the instructor, but courses taken while in Limited Status will not satisfy minimum degree or residency requirements for any UC graduate program to which the student eventually might be admitted. ACADEMIC ADVISING In each academic unit with an advanced degree program, there is at least one formally appointed Graduate Advisor or Director of Graduate Studies. The Graduate Advisor is a regular faculty member responsible for supervising graduate Graduate Studies and Research 21 study in that unit, for monitoring the academic progress of graduate students, and for seeing that each graduate student is assigned a faculty advisor. The Graduate Advisor plays a key role in the academic lives of graduate students, advising students and other faculty members about program require\u00ad ments and the academic policies of the Division of Graduate Studies and Research, approving study lists, and evaluating academic petitions. In many academic units the Graduate Advisor is instrumental in the selection of students for assistantship and fellowship appointments, and in the super\u00ad vision of graduate student teachers. In most schools there also is an Associate Dean for Graduate Studies who coor- UC IRVINE - 1982-198322 Graduate Studies and Research dinates many of the functions which affect graduate students within that school. Both Graduate Advisors and Deans are important links between the student and the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and Research. Most graduate students also will have an individual faculty advisor or advising committee, especially after the first year of advanced study. When a student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D., the doctoral committee becomes the primary source of academic guidance; however, student academic peti\u00ad tions still must be approved by the Graduate Advisor. ACADEMIC POLICIES The academic policies described in this section of the Cata\u00ad logue apply to students enrolled in study leading to graduate degrees and California education credentials. Other regula\u00ad tions and procedures of importance to graduate students are covered in the Academic Regulations and Enrollment and Other Procedures sections and in the description of each graduate program. Scholastic Requirements A graduate student is expected to make satisfactory progress toward an approved academic objective, as defined by the faculty of the program in accordance with policies of the Graduate Council, and to maintain a satisfactory grade point average for all work undertaken while enrolled in graduate study. Satisfactory progress is determined on the basis of both the recent academic record and overall performance. A graduate student normally is expected to complete satisfac\u00ad torily at least eight units of academic credit applicable to the graduate program in each regular academic session (unless on an approved Leave of Absence), and satisfy all requirements of the academic program according to an approved schedule. For a graduate student, only the grades A, A-, B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship and may be applied toward advanced degree requirements. However, a UCI course iri which a grade of B-is earned may be accepted in partial satis\u00ad faction of the degree requirements if the student has a grade point average of at least 3.0 in all cours~s applicable to the degree. Graduate students may not apply courses graded Pass or Not Pass toward any degree or satisfactory progress requirements. A grade point average below the B level (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) is not satisfactory, and a student whose grade point average is below that level is subject to academic disqualification. A student's academic progress ordinarily is evaluated on the basis of the academic record. A few weeks after the end of a quarter, an updated copy of each enrolled student's per\u00ad manent academic record is available from the Registrar. This record lists all UCI courses for which a graduate student was enrolled (including courses taken through the Intercampus Exchange Program), the grades assigned, and the cumulative grade point average. Formal candidacy for an advanced degree, degrees conferred, certain examinations passed, unit credit accepted from other institutions, and other important academic information is recorded also. A graduate student who has not demonstrated satisfactory progress is not eligible for any academic appointment, such as Reader, Research Assistant, or Teaching Assistant, and may not hold a fellowship or other award which is based upon academic merit. Grading With the consent of the academic units involved, individual study and research courses at the graduate level may be graded Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory (S/U). Certain graduate courses are graded S/U only, with the approval of the Gradu-ate Council. A grade of Sis equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No credit is given for a course in which a grade of U was assigned. Graduate students may take one course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program; may not be applied to the requirements for an advanced degree; and do not count toward the minimum number of units for which a graduate student must enroll. The grade of Incomplete (I) may be assigned by an instructor when the student's work is of passing quality, but is incom\u00ad plete because of circumstances beyond the student's control. Although Incomplete grades do not affect a graduate stu\u00ad dent's grade point average, they are an important factor in evaluating academic progress. The maximum amount of time that ~n instructor may allow for making up incomplete work is three quarters of enrollment, but stricter limits may be applied. When work is completed within the time allowed, the student should ask the instructor to submit a change of grade notice to the Registrar, ordinarily through the dean of the school in which the course was offered. If not made up within the time allowed, an I grade. is recorded permanently. IP (in Progress) is a transcript notation restricted to sequen\u00ad tial courses extending over two or more quarters, for which use of the IP notation has been approved. When the last quarter of the sequence is completed, the grade for the final quarter is assigned for all quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. A student who received an NR (No Report) transcript nota\u00ad tion must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. After one quarter, an NR becomes an F which will remain permanently upon the student's record. A graduate student may repeat once a course in which a grade below B (3.0) or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade is used in computing the stu\u00ad dent's grade point average for the first eight units of repeated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades are used. Additional information about grading may be found in the Academic Regulations section. Academic Disqualification After consultation with the student's academic unit, the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research may disqualify a student who has a grade point average in graduate and upper-division courses below 3.0 for two or more successive quarters; or fails to pass (or does not take) a required exami\u00ad nation within the time specified for that graduate program; or does not maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of an approved program of study. Unsatisfactory academic progress may be determined on the basis of explicit requirements, but the professional judgment of the faculty upon review of all graduate work undertaken by the student is paramount. Ordinarily, a student whose work does not meet academic standards will be given written notice and a reasonable period of time in which to make up all deficiencies. Prior to taking final action to disqualify, the Graduate Dean ordinarily will notify a student who is subject to academic UC IRVINE - 1982-1983disqualification and will provide reasonable opportunity for the student to correct erroneous or outdated academic records, to submit other information or comments in writing, or to request a second review of his or her academic performance. Upon written notice of academic disqualification by the Graduate Dean, disqualification will be noted on the formal academic record of that student. Following the formal notice of disqualification, the student may appeal to the Graduate Dean only on the basis of procedural error. Academic Residence A graduate student is considered to be in residence during an academic quarter if at least four units of academic credit are earned in regular upper-division or graduate courses. Credit for one academic quarter of residence may be earned by com\u00ad pleting at least two units of credit in approved\u00b7 courses in each of two Summer Sessions. In the case of Ph.D. students, these must be consecutive sessions. Enrollment Policy Full-time academic enrolhrient ordinarily is expected of grad\u00ad uate students at the University of California. Full-time study is defined as enrollment in at least 12 units of upper-division or graduate academic credit per quarter, including credit for supervised research or teaching. Graduate students may enroll in lower-division courses with the approval of their academic advisors, but such courses are not considered to be part of any graduate program. Graduate students ordinarily may not receive credit for more than 12 units per quarter in graduate courses, or 16 units in upper-division courses, or a proportionate number in com\u00ad bination. Course loads in excess of 16 units must be approved in advance by both the student's Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Although in most instances completion of an advanced degree at UCI requires full-time study, the University recog\u00ad nizes the legitimate need for part-time study opportunities and is committed to increasing those opportunities wherever possible. Graduate degree programs may be opened to part\u00ad time students wherever good educational reasons exist for so doing. Under this policy, part-time enrollment at the graduate level is defined as enrollment for eight units or less, including enrollment in Physical Education classes. Within the guide\u00ad lines and limitations on the application form available in the Division Office, graduate students may petition for part-time status and, if the petition is approved, shall pay the full Uni\u00ad versity Registration Fee and student activities fees, one-half the Educational Fee, and one-half the Nonresident Tuition Fee (if applicable). Continuous Registration A graduate student is expected to enroll for each regular aca\u00ad demic session (fall, winter, arid spring quarters) until all requirements for an advanced degree or credential have been completed, including final examinations and the submission of an approved thesis or dissertation. Enrollment is not offi\u00ad cial until all required fees have been paid and the student's Enrollment in Classes Petition is completed correctly, signed where necessary, and submitted to the Registrar. Students are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollment is correct. For more information, see the Enrollment and Other Procedures section. A student engaged in study or research outside the State of California for an entire quarter ordinarily will register in absentia. Unless an official Leave of Absence (see below) has been granted, or a petition to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of reg-Graduate Studies and Research 23 istration has been approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, a student who does not register by the final deadlines for any regular quarter will lose graduate standing, and candidacy for any advanced degree will lapse. Prior to resuming graduate study in the University, a former student must successfully apply for readmission. A readmitted stu\u00ad dent must register and then be advanced or reinstated to candidacy at least one quarter before receiving an advanced degree. A degree cannot be conferred earlier than the second quarter following readmission. A graduate student who decides to leave the University after enrolling and paying fees for a quarter must file an official Notice of Withdrawal or Cancellation with the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. A graduate student in good academic standing who withdraws from graduate study and intends to return within one year may submit an application for a Leave of Absence. If the leave is approved, the student remains in good standing and need not apply for readmission in order to enroll at the expiration of the leave period. \u00b7 Leave of Absence A graduate student who withdraws from the University with the intention of returning within one year and wishes to avoid a lapse of student status should request a Leave of Absence. A Leave of Absence of up to one year's duration may be granted by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research upon the recommendation of the student's aca\u00ad demic unit, subject to the following guidelines: I. The student must have completed satisfactorily at least one quarter in residence and be in good academic standing. The leave must be consistent with the student's academic objectives. 2. Leave ordinarily is approved in cases of serious illness or other temporary disability, or temporary interruption of the student's academic program for other appropriate reasons. 3. A student on leave is not eligible for assistance from a University fellowship, research grant, or financial aid pro\u00ad gram, and may not hold an academic appointment or compar\u00ad able University employment. During a period of leave, a stu\u00ad dent may not take comprehensive or qualifying examinations or earn academic credit (except by a transfer of credit from another institution approved in advance by the Graduate Dean). Leave may not be granted to students who intend to make use of most University resources or facilities (including housing), and it may be revoked if they do so. 4. A student failing to register for the next regular academic session following the expiration of leave will lose graduate standing and will be subject to the readmission policy des\u00ad cribed below. Readmission A student who previously withdrew from the University, or whose student status has lapsed, may request readmission to graduate study by submitting an Application for Readmission with a $25 fee, which is nonrefundable. The Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and Research may grant readmission when recom\u00ad mended by the academic unit. If readmitted, a student's pre\u00ad vious academic work will be applied toward the requirements for an advanced degree only with the approval of the Gradu\u00ad ate Advisor and the Graduate Dean. A readmitted student must satisfy the academic requirements in effect at the time of readmission and may be required to satisfy certain requirements a second time, including those for formal UC IRVINE - 1982-198324 Graduate Studies and Research advancement to candidacy. A readmitted student must regis\u00ad ter and then be advanced or reinstated to candidacy at least one quarter before receiving an advanced degree, which will be conferred no earlier than the second quarter following readmission. Intercampus Exchange Program A graduate student in good standing who wishes to take advantage of educational opportunities available only at another campus of the University of California may do so through the Intercampus Exchange Program. Ordinarily, an exchange student will have demonstrated a high level of scholarship during at least one year of graduate study at the home campus and will have well-defined academic objectives. Approval of the faculty advisor, the host department(s), and the Deans of the respective Graduate Divisions is required. Direct arrangements between faculty members on the two campuses are encouraged so as to ensure that courses, seminars, or facilities will be available to meet the participat\u00ad ing student's needs. Students may take courses on more than one campus of the University in the same academic session. The exchange student enrolls and pays fees on the home campus and then enrolls at the host campus, following the procedures of that Registrar's Office. A report of academic work completed will be transferred to the student's academic record on the home campus. Although eligible for all normal student services, the exchange student is a visitor and is not formally admitted to graduate study at the host campus. Application forms for the Intercampus Exchange Program may be obtained from the Graduate Division Office of the student's home campus and should be filed with the Office at least four weeks before the beginning of the quarter in order to avoid penalties for late filing of the study list. Transfers of Credit At least one-half of the course re-quirement for a master's degree must be completed while in residence as a graduate student at UCI. Credit for up to one-fifth of the minimum number of units required for a master's degree may be allowed for graduate-level work completed at another institu\u00ad tion or through University Extension prior to first graduate enrollment at UCI. Such courses do not count toward the required number of units in 200-series courses. Up to one\u00ad half the units required may be accepted from another Gradu\u00ad ate Division of the University of California. After enroll\u00ad ment, the student must initiate a formal petition for such credit. The acceptance of unit credit earned in another pro\u00ad gram must be recommended by the academic unit to which the student has been admitted and be approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. No units of transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B (3.0) or equivalent was assigned. Under no circumstances will grade credit be transferred. A student currently enrolled in a master's degree program or on a Leave of Absence may receive unit credit (not grade credit) for graduate-level work completed at another institu\u00ad tion or through University Extension only with the prior approval of the departmental Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. No transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B or equivalent was assigned. A student who begins graduate study at UCI in the fall quar\u00ad ter will receive appropriate credit for courses taken in preced\u00ad ing UCI Summer Sessions, provided that the formal date of admission precedes Summer Session enrollment. Continuing graduate students will receive credit for courses taken in intervening UCI Summer Sessions. GRADUATE DEGREES Master's Degrees The master's degree is conferred at the end of the academic quarter in which all requirements have been satisfied, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council. The student must be advanced to candidacy for the degree prior to the beginning of the final quarter of enrollment. Therefore, an application for advancement to candidacy, initiated by the student and approved by the academic unit, should be sub\u00ad mitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research at least 30 days before the opening of the quarter in which the degree is expected. The Master of Arts (M.A.) or Master of Science (M.S.) degree normally is attained by one of two routes: Plan I; a thesis; or Plan II, a comprehensive examination. Both require a minimum of one year in residence, satisfactory completion of prescribed course work, and an appropriate demonstration of achievement. Plan I includes a minimum of seven courses (28 units), 20 units or more of which must be at the graduate level; a thesis; and a general examination. Plan II requires at least nine courses (36 units), including 24 units or more at the graduate level, and a comprehensive examination cover\u00ad ing a broad range of subject matter in the discipline. Only approved 200-series courses completed while in residence at the University satisfy the minimum graduate course require\u00ad ment. Some programs will have course requirements exceed\u00ad ing the minimums cited above and may have additional or alternative degree requirements. Please refer to the descrip\u00ad tion of the specific program for more information. Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) degrees are awarded by the School of Fine Arts (M.F.A. in Fine Arts) and by the Program in Writing (M.F.A. in English) upon successful completion of the equivalent of two years or more of full-time study with an emphasis upon creative expression and professional devel\u00ad opment. Special thesis or comprehensive examination requirements are established for these programs. Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) degrees are awarded upon successful completion of programs designed for the professional development of secondary school teachers and college instructors. A minimum of one year in residence is required, usually including Summer Session course work. A thesis project or other comparable evidence of professional attainment is part of each M.A.T. program. Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.), Master of Pub\u00ad lic Administration (M.F.A.), and Master of Business and Pub\u00ad lic Administration (M.B.P.A.) degrees are awarded by the Graduate School of Management upon successful completion of the equivalent of two years of full-time study in the devel\u00ad opment of professional managerial skills. Doctor of Philosophy Degree The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is awarded on the basis of evidence that the recipient possesses knowledge of a broad field of learning and expert mastery of a particular area of concentration within it. The research dissertation is expected to demonstrate critical judgment, intellectual syn\u00ad thesis, creativity, and skill in written communication. The candidate for the Ph.D. is expected to be in full-time res\u00ad idence for at least six regular academic quarters. Four to six years.of full-time academic work beyond the bachelor's degree typically is required to complete the degree. At the end of the first year or so of full-time study, many programs UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Graduate Studies and Research 25 UC IRVINE - 1982-198326 Graduate Studies and Research administer a preliminary examination on the student's mas\u00ad tery of fundamental knowledge in the discipline. Upon suc\u00ad cessfully demonstrating a high level of scholarship on this examination and after further study, the student will con\u00ad tinue to a series of qualifying examinations which lead to formal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. Graduate students ordinarily attain candidacy status for the Ph.D. degree when all preparatory work has been completed, when qualifying examinations have been passed, and when they are ready for the dissertation phase. Students are recommended for advancement to candidacy by unanimous vote of the candidacy committee appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research on behalf of the Graduate Council. The proposed candidacy committee list must be sub\u00ad mitted to the Division Office (on the Ph.D. Form I) at least two weeks before the final qualifying examination is to be given, so that formal appointment can be made before the examination date. The Report on Qualifying Examination for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Form II) must be signed by the committee at the time the candidacy examination is concluded and submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Following a unanimous favorable vote of the committee, the student will be advanced to candidacy upon payment of the $25 Candidacy Fee. Candidacy for the Ph.D. will lapse automatically if the student loses graduate standing by academic disqualification or failure to comply with the University policy on continuous registration. A readmitted student who was a candidate for the Ph.D. must again advance to candidacy and thereafter enroll as a candidate for at least one academic quarter before the Ph.D. may be conferred. Following advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D., a doctoral committee appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research (on behalf of the Graduate Council) supervises the student's program, approves the dissertation, and conducts the final oral examination if required. The chair of the doc\u00ad toral committee is the member of the faculty responsible for providing primary guidance of the student's dissertation. Ordinarily, the final examination will be given just prior to completion of the dissertation and while the student is in res\u00ad idence during a regular academic session, and will be open to all members of the academic community. Ph.D. degrees are conferred, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council, as of the last day of the regular academic quarter in which all requirements have been satisfied. The In-Candidacy Fee Offset Grant By action of each academic unit, the Graduate Council, and the Academic Senate Coordinating Committee on Graduate Affairs, a Normative Time has been established for each Ph.D. program. This is the expected number of 12-month years from first enrollment to completion of the Ph.D. for students entering with normal preparation who are able to study without serious interruptions. The Normative Time established for UCI Ph.D. programs is five years in all fields except (years in parentheses): Biological Sciences (four or five), Comparative Culture (six), Comparative Literature (six), Engineering (four), French (six), German (six), History (six), Information and Computer Science (four or five), Man\u00ad agement (six). A Ph.D. student in good standing will be eligible for a quar\u00ad terly grant equal to the Educational Fee if: I. the student is a formal candidate for the Ph.D., as of the first day of the quarter; 2. the student's accrued time since first enrollment is less than the Normative Time for completion of the Ph.D. estab-lished for that graduate program (accrued time is equal to elapsed time from first enrollment as a UCI graduate student less (a) up to three quarters of approved leave, and (b) any time between completion of a graduate program or formal withdrawal and readmission in a different field of study); 3. the student is not entitled to payment of the Educational Fee from an extramural fellowship, grant, or traineeship; and 4. satisfactory academic progress has been certified by the Graduate Advisor. Additional information about the In-Candidacy Fee Offset Grant program and application forms are available from the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. Theses and Dissertations Candidates for the Ph.D. and certain master's degrees must conduct an extensive research project and submit a thesis or dissertation in order to fulfill degree requirements. Research expenses are not supported by the University, and the cost of preparing the thesis or dissertation ordinarily ranges from $200 to $1,000, but may be considerably more. Soon after advancement to candidacy, those Ph.D. or mas\u00ad ter's candidates who are writing a thesis or dissertation should consult with the Manuscript Advisor in the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. The Manuscript Advisor has the responsibility of ensuring that the established proce\u00ad dures and standards of UCI are upheld in the preparation of theses and dissertations. After approval by the doctoral or thesis committee appointed for each candidate by the Gradu\u00ad ate Council, a copy of the dissertation (two copies of a mas\u00ad ter's thesis) must be filed with the Manuscript Advisor for placement in the UCI Library. The final copy must meet the University's requirements for style, format, and appearance \u00b7 before the degree can be conferred. Dissertations filed later than the end of the sixth week of instruction of an academic quarter ordinarily cannot be reviewed and accepted in time for the degree to be conferred in that quarter. Ordinarily, a graduate student will be registered for the quar\u00ad ter in which the dissertation or thesis is submitted and the degree is to be conferred, and no additional fees are required. If the manuscript is submitted and accepted before the first day of the regular academic quarter in which the degree is to be conferred and the student was registered for the previous regular quarter, additional fees usually are not required. The Filing fee Under certain circumstances, a student may be eligible to pay a Filing Fee equal to half of the Registration Fee in lieu of reg\u00ad istration, subject to the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. In general, all requirements for a degree must have been satisfied prior to the start of the quarter, except for the submission of the final version of the dissertation or thesis, or the completion of a final oral or comprehensive examination. The student who intends to make use of any University resource, to hold any academic appointment or comparable University employment, or to receive any student service for which official registration and payment of regular fees is a requirement is not eligible to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of registration. A Filing Fee will not be accepted immediately following readmission and will be accepted immediately following a Leave of Absence only under exceptional circumstances. The date for payment of the Filing Fee without a late service fee is the same as that for the payment of other student fees. If all degree require\u00ad ments are not completed during the quarter in which the Fil\u00ad ing Fee is paid, the student must subsequently register and pay all applicable fees. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Conferral of Graduate Degrees Prior to the beginning of the quarter in which an advanced degree is to be conferred, the student must have advanced to candidacy for that degree and should have received formal notice confirming candidacy from the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. The student should consult the departmental Graduate Advisor to determine which degree requirements, if any, have not yet been satisfied. No later than the beginning of the final quarter, the student should file a Graduation and Diploma Information form with the Division of Graduate Studies and Research and verify with the departmental office that the student's name is included on the tentative degree list. If a master's thesis or doctoral dissertation is to be submitted, the Manuscript Ad\u00ad visor should be cor~sulted well in advance about the final format and the deadline for submission of the approved manuscript. Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are avail\u00ad able, which is approximately 90 days after the quarter in which the degrees are awarded. Financial Assistance for Graduate Students The University offers many types of financial assistance to graduate students. These include fellowships, teaching and research assistantships, tuition fellowships for nonresident students, grants-in-aid, student loans, and Work-Study. Applicants interested in assistantships or fellowships should so indicate when applying for admission; continuing students should contact their program's Graduate Advisor. Most awards are made in April or May of the preceding academic year. Regents' Fellowships will be awarded to a number of promis\u00ad ing students entering graduate study at UCI leading to the Doctor of Philosophy or Master of Fine Arts degree. Awards include a stipend, all required student fees, and, if applicable, Nonresident Tuition. Other fellowships are offered, including tuition awards for outstanding scholars who are not resi\u00ad dents of California. In many cases, fellowship stipends may be supplemented by partial assistantship appointments. Entering or continuing graduate students may be awarded research or teaching assistantships for all or part of the aca\u00ad demic year. The types of assistantships, number available, and required duties vary according to the activities of the academic unit. Neither assistantship includes remission of fees or tuition, but a graduate assistant who is not a Califor\u00ad nia resident also may receive a tuition fellowship. Through the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Pro\u00ad gram, a number of fellowships and assistantships are awarded to first-and second-year graduate students on the basis of need and academic promise. All fellowship awards and assistantship appointments are made in accordance with the affirmative action policies of the University. Grants for doctoral research and a limited number of disser\u00ad tation fellowships are awarded each year; additional informa\u00ad tion is available from the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. The Division Office also provides information and assistance to students who wish to apply for fellowships from federal agencies, foundations, and other non-University sources. The Fees, Expenses, and Financial Aid section contains information about assistance based upon financial need that is administered by the Financial Aid Office, including grants, loans, and Work-Study awards. A Financial Aid Prospectus is available from the Financial Aid Office. Graduate Studies and Research 27 RESEARCH The University of California is the State's primary research institution. Most scholarly research and creative activities are supported by University funds or by grants and contracts from federal and state agencies, foundations, corporations, and individual sponsors. In addition to University funding, over $34 million from extramural sources was awarded to the University of California, Irvine in the 1980-81 fiscal year for basic and applied research and for other scholarly activity. Under direction of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, the Office of Contracts and Grants Administration (OCGA) is responsible for the submission of proposals, acceptance of grant and contract awards, and negotiation of all awards for extramurally funded research, training, fellow\u00ad ship, and public service programs. The OCGA maintains a Resource Center containing the most current information about extramural funding sources for student and faculty research. While most research takes place at the academic unit level, the academic quality of many of UCI's educational programs is enhanced by Organized Research Units and Focused Research Programs that extend beyond unit boundaries. Organized Research Units An Organized Research Unit (ORU) ordinarily consists of an interdepartmental group of faculty, students, and other re\u00ad searchers engaged in a continuing program of research, sup\u00ad ported by both University and extramural funding. The work of some OR Us is directed toward the solution of complex contemporary problems, while others conduct basic research essential to the understanding of natural or social phe\u00ad nomena or of humanistic ideas and expressions. Organized Research Units established on the Irvine campus by The Regents of the University are the Cancer Research Institute, the Developmental Biology Center, the Institute of Transpor\u00ad tation Studies (ITS), and the Public Policy Research Organi\u00ad zation (PPRO). Cancer Research Institute The Cancer Research Institute is an Organized Research Unit established by The Regents of the University in early 1980 to provide leadership and support for researchers work\u00ad ing toward understanding and controlling cancer. The Insti\u00ad tute serves as a means of focusing, coordinating, and direct\u00ad ing efforts of scholars in basic and clinical sciences from sev\u00ad eral departments of the School of Biological Sciences and the UCI-California College of Medicine. The ORU provides a central source of information concerning cancer-related research, as well as a forum in which basic researchers and clinicians can assess advances that may be of immediate value in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and in the detection of chemicals or conditions that cause cancer. Ongoing and projected research activities involve the regulation of cell function, tumor cell surfaces and control of proliferation and metastasis, viral carcinogenesis, environmental carcinogene\u00ad sis, and clinically related studies. Developmental Biology Center The Developmental Biology Center is an Organized Research Unit that provides a focus within the School of Biological Sci\u00ad ences and the UCI-California College of Medicine for research in several related areas of developmental biology and genetics. The major goal of the Center is to understand the mechanisms responsible for the control of growth and the generation of spatial patterns of differentiation during development. Experimental techniques from the fields of cell biology, embryology, genetics, neurobiology, and endocrine!- UC IRVINE - 1982-198328 Graduate Studies and Research ogy are applied to insects, hydra, fish, and amphibians. The work carried out in the Center has potential implications in such areas as the control of growth and regeneration of lost body parts and the cause and prevention of cancer, nervous system anomalies, and birth defects in man. Research in the Center also involves the analysis of insect developmental hormones which may provide new methods to control agri\u00ad cultural pests and disease vectors. Institute of Transportation Studies The Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS) was established to foster research, education, and training in the field of transportation. The Institute has been an Organized Research Unit within the University of California since 1947, with its main branch located on the Berkeley campus. The Irvine campus branch was established in 197 4. Emphasis at Irvine has been on the development of a strong interdisciplinary research capability. Completed and ongoing research projects have involved faculty and students from the Graduate School of Management, the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences, the School of Engineering, the Program in Social Ecol\u00ad ogy, the UCI-California College of Medicine, and the Department of Information and Computer Science. Research at Irvine focuses upon transportation systems planning and evaluation, fiscal and administrative management of public transit systems, labor relations in the transit industry, and energy and environmental issues. Current projects include \"Comparative Analyses of Transit Performance,\" \"Chaining Behavior in Urban Trip Making,\" \"The Impact of Changing Women's Roles on Transportation Needs,\" \"Evaluation of Private Sector Provision of Urban Commuter Services,\" \"Transit Investment Alternatives,\" and \"Transit Labor Rela\u00ad tions.\" A portion of Institute funding is used to sponsor post\u00ad doctoral research fellowships and visiting professorships. The Institute maintains an extensive research collection to support these activities. The 12,000-volume collection includes books, journals, dissertations, and technical reports in the field of urban transportation. A wide range of services is offered including computer-based literature searching. Students and faculty are encouraged to meet with the Infor\u00ad mation Center's trained personnel to discuss research needs and strategies. Public Policy Research Organization The Public Policy Research Organization (PPRO) is an Organized Research Unit established to foster empirically grounded research into problems of public policy. In pursuing its broad policies studies mission, PPRO has focused its effort since 1973 on information technology and public policy and more recently has developed research programs concerned with public management and human cost accounting. As a campuswide research unit, PPRO draws its research expertise from the full faculty and student resources of the Irvine campus. Of the 90 faculty and students currently doing research in PPRO, the majority are from the School of Social Sciences, the Department of Information and Com\u00ad puter Science, the Program in Social Ecology, the Graduate School of Management, and the UCI-California College of Medicine. Among PPRO researchers are experts in law, pub\u00ad lic administration, economics, public finance, political science, sociology, psychology, planning, and public health. PPRO projects are multidisciplinary by nature. Among the 22 projects currently in progress are studies of the effectiveness of Federal Civil Service reforms; the use of information sys\u00ad tems in U.S. and European local governments; the social and mental health impacts of economic change; the effects of environmental air on respiratory symptoms; the incidence of injuries to children in auto accidents; and case studies of the prohlems and costs faced by new users of computer technology. PPRO maintains extensive survey research, data analysis, and data archiving capabilities which support its research efforts and which serve researchers in various UCI academic units. A limited number of graduate assistantships and Work\u00ad Study positions are available to qualified UCI students who wish to participate in PPRO research projects or in the prepa\u00ad ration of research proposals. Focused Research Progranns Focused Research Programs are established by the Chancellor for the purpose of developing and, for a limited period of time, sustaining interdisciplinary research that could not be carried out through individual effort or within a single aca\u00ad demic unit. Because of the developmental nature of these programs, they ordinarily are approved for no more than three years and are supported partly by University funds. If a research program develops successfully, it may continue with extramural and/or University support. Seven groups of faculty, students, and other researchers have been recognized as Focused Research Programs. Alternative Sources of Hydrocarbons Researchers from the Department of Chemistry in the School of Physical Sciences and the Departments of Molecu\u00ad lar Biology and Biochemistry and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology in the School of Biological Sciences are involved in the development of new sources of alternative and renewable petrochemicals from plant biomass. The project is being con\u00ad ducted in collaboration with Mexican scientists from the Uni\u00ad versidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico and the Centro de Investigacion de Quimica Aplicada. Authority Studies Authority relations in a variety of social organizations and institutions (work places, schools, families) are the foci of a project involving faculty from the School of Social Sciences, the Department of History (School of Humanities), and the Graduate School of Management. Project goals are to develop broad theories about authority and a useful data archive on the subject. The initial theoretical emphasis is on problems of adaptation to unaccustomed authority relations and those raised by attempts to change occupational author\u00ad ity through self-management arrangements. Brain Function The Focused Research Project on Brain Function seeks to develop an understanding of the role of small groups of neurons in brain function. It involves the close interaction of theoretical\" physicists from the Department of Physics in the School of Physical Sciences and experimental neurobiologists from the Department of Psychobiology in the School of Bio\u00ad logical Sciences, who utilize recent advances in studying cooperative phenomena in physical systems. Chemistry and Physics of Crystal Surfaces Researchers from the Departments of Chemistry and Physics are investigating the nature of chemical reactions on sur\u00ad faces, using the scattering of laser light from surfaces as the basic experimental technique, and exploring fundamental questions in the theory of vibrational motion of surfaces and absorbed atoms. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Diabetes Mellitus Faculty participants include basic and clinical researchers representing the Departments of Pathology, Medicine, Pedi\u00ad atrics, Ophthalmology, and Neurology in the UCI-California College of Medicine and the Program in Social Ecology. The project is designed to establish an interdisciplinary research program directed at developing techniques to improve blood glucose control in diabetics and determining the psychological and biomedical results of the application of these techniques. A registry of diabetic patients in Orange County will be created as part of the program to provide a data resource for the study of diabetes from an epidemiological perspective. Goethe Faculty from the Departments of German, French and Ital\u00ad ian, the Program in Comparative Literature, and the School of Fine Arts, along with scholars from the UCLA Depart\u00ad ment of German and the UCSC Department of Literature, have mounted a symposium on Goethe on the 150th anni\u00ad versary of his death (1982), concentrating on his narrative fiction. Con.comitant goals are to foster scholarly research papers on Goethe and to facilitate collaboration among lead\u00ad ing older and younger scholars concerned with Goethe. Vulnerable Populations Faculty from the Program in Social Ecology, the School of Social Sciences, the School of Engineering, and the UCI\u00ad California College of Medicine are working to advance knowledge about \"vulnerable groups\" in the population. Interviews will be conducted with a random sample of Orange County residents, focusing on substantive issues such as population growth, housing, environmental quality, transportation, employment, and human services. A collab\u00ad orative effort of data collection and survey analysis will pro\u00ad vide systematic studies of the extent to which attitudes, life circumstances, and responses to change vary among distin\u00ad guishable populations. Educational Technology Center The primary focus of the Educational Technology Center (ETC) is the interactive use of the computer as an aid to learning in many different areas. Emphasis is on inexpensive, graphic personal computers now available for schools and homes. The activities of the Center range from fundamental research to the development of learning modules. The Cen\u00ad ter is particularly interested in developing production capabil\u00ad ities which will lead toward the efficient large-scale produc\u00ad tion of highly effective computer-based learning modules. Mexico/Chicano Research The Mexico/Chicano program was established in early 1981 to support faculty and graduate student activities in the areas of Mexican studies, Chicano studies, U.S.-Mexico relations, and collaborations with Mexican scholars. The program has made awards to faculty to coordinate ongoing research activi\u00ad ties, initiate research programs, and formalize existing ties with Mexican researchers and institutions. Graduate stu\u00ad dent awards support research and travel costs related to activities in the above areas. Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project Financed through private and federal funds, the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLGJ Project has been in operation at the University of Californi\u00b7a since the summer of 1972. The goals of the project are to create the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae, a data bank of Greek literature from its Homeric beginnings to approximately A.D. 600; to conduct literary research using collected texts; and to apply technological innovation to these endeavors. The TLG's research activities are multifaceted, Graduate Studies and Research 29 combining the traditional concerns and methodologies of philological and literary study with the most advanced features of computer technology. Included among the research foci currently pursued by the Project are the identi\u00ad fication of ancient Greek literary and documentary materials extant from various literary-historical periods; the develop\u00ad ment of procedures pertinent to the conversion of these materials into machine-readable form; the enhancement of automated text-verification routines; and the examination of criteria for data-capture of \"nonstandard\" source materials such as documentary papyri and inscriptions. The Project staff is investigating procedures to allow for nationwide access to data-bank resources located at UCI. The TLG data bank currently contains more than 42 million words of Greek text and is expected to grow to 90 million words in the future. Although a separate administrative entity, the TLG is closely related to the Department of Classics in many respects. Faculty members of the Department are involved to varying degrees in TLG research; Classics graduate students are encouraged to apply for TLG assistantships; UCI's library and research resources in Classics are immeasurably enhanced by the text and reference holdings acquired by the TLG for its own purposes; TLG-related conferences and visits by scholars from North America and Europe afford the Department and its students many contacts with eminent classicists of special competence. The establishment and availability of a data bank of ancient Greek literary and doc\u00ad umentary materials have made UCI a major source of re\u00ad search activity in the field of Classics. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS The Office of Admissions welcomes inquiries on any aspect of becoming eligible for the University of California and on planning for transfer. Admissions counselors are available in 245 Administration Building, and inquiries may be addressed to the Office of Admissions, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717. General information on application filing is available by telephoning (714) 833-6703; for specific questions regarding admission or eligibility, telephone (714) 833-6705. The University's undergraduate admission requirements, which are the same on all campuses, are based on two princi\u00ad ples: (I) the best predictor of success in the University is high scholarship in previous work, and (2) the study of certain sub\u00ad jects in high school gives a student good preparation for Uni-. versity work. The information on admission to UCI given below is organ\u00ad ized as follows: Preparing for University Work Categories of Application Admission to Freshman Standing Admission to Advanced Standing Nonresident Admission Requirements Admission to International Students Application Procedures Additional Information PREPARING FOR UNIVERSITY WORK A carefully planned program of high school courses provides students with the best preparation for University work. It can give them a definite edge in their undergraduate studies and the opportunity to do advanced preparation for their chosen field of study. Most important, if students master cer\u00ad tain basic subjects and skills in high school, they substantially increase their chances of success at the University. The \"a through f\" requirements for admission to the Univer\u00ad sity of.California are minimum entrance standards. Complet\u00ad ing the required high school courses with satisfactory grades will not automatically prepare students for freshman work in every subject, much less in their major or program of study. Many entering students discover that they are not ade\u00ad quately prepared for basic University courses, such as English composition and calculus, which they are expected to take in their freshman year. Also, many undergraduate majors, par\u00ad ticularly those in the sciences and mathematics, require more high school preparation than that necessary for admission to the University. This lack of preparation can cause problems for students who do not choose a major until after they enter the University, or for those who prepare for one major but later decide to change to another. For these reasons, students should take courses that will pre\u00ad pare them beyond minimum levels of competence in reading. writing, and mathematics. A student who is well-prepared for University work will have taken four years of English in high school, three to four years of mathematics, two to three years of foreign language, two to three years of laboratory science, one year of history, and one or more years of art or humanities. It is important to appreciate that good study skills and study habits are essential for doing well at the University. For example, students will need to know how to be effective in reading a textbook, how to approach word problems in sci\u00ad ence and mathematics, how to take useful notes in lectures, and how to plan and enforce their own study schedule. These skills are developed in the more advanced courses in high school. In addition, University courses often assume that background material is fresh in the student's mind and thoroughly mastered. Therefore, a student should take as challenging a high school program as possible, with a full academic course load through the senior year. If a student takes more than the minimum number of courses required in an \"a through f\" subject, only the highest grade(s) will be used in determining the grade point average. Thus, by'taking a challenging academic program in high school, a student can improve the probability of success at the University without jeopardizing their qualifications for admission. Reading Many students are not prepared for either the kinds or amounts of reading demanded of freshmen at the Univer\u00ad sity. Each student should become proficient in reading and understanding technical materials and scholarly works and should learn to read analytically and critically, actively ques\u00ad tioning the author's intentions, viewpoint, arguments, and conclusions. Students should also become familiar, and com\u00ad fortable, with the conventions of standard written English, and with various writing strategies and techniques. Reading experience should include original works in their entirety, not just textbooks and anthologies, and should encompass a wide variety of forms and topics. Writing Effective critical thinking and proficiency with the written language are closely related, and both are skills which every University student must master. By University stand\u00ad ards, q student who is proficient in English composition is able to (a) understand the assigned topic; (b) select and develop a theme by argument and example; (c) choose words which aptly and precisely convey the intended meaning; (d) construct effective sentences, i.e., sentences that economi\u00ad cally and successfully convey the writer's ideas and display a variety of structures; (e) demonstrate an awareness of the conventions of standard written English, avoiding such errors as sentence fragments, run-together sentences, faulty agreements, and improper pronoun references; and (f) punc\u00ad tuate, capitalize, and spell correctly. A student planning to attend the University must take Eng\u00ad lish courses in high school that require the development and practice of these skills. University entrance requirements include at least four years of English composition and litera\" ture that stress expository writing: the development of per\u00ad suasive critical thinking on the written page. Mathematics Many undergraduate majors require prepara\u00ad tion in mathematics beyond that necessary for admission to the University. All majors in the natural and life sciences, engineering, and mathematics require calculus. Many majors in the social sciences require statistics or calculus, sometimes both. If a student has selected a major that requires either calculus or statistics, that course should be taken during the freshman year at the University. Calculus is also required for undergraduates preparing for careers in environmental sciences, dentistry, medicine, optometry, pharmacy, and biostatistics. Many students are not aware of the large number of fields outside the natural and mathematical sciences which require calculus or statistics as prerequisites. Students should prepare for University courses in calculus while still in high school. In addition to the two years of mathematics required for admission, a second year of algebra UC IRVINE - 1982-1983and a year of precalculus mathematics are essential. These courses should include (a) basic operations with numerical and algebraic functions; (b) operations with exponents and radicals; (c) linear equations and inequalities; (d) polynomials and polynomial equations; (e) functions and their graphs; (f) trigonometry, logarithms, and exponential functions; and (g) applications and word problems. Students who plan to enter a field which requires statistics should take at least the second year of algebra. Students not proficient in basic and intermediate algebra will be at an enormous disadvantage in the University. It will be necessary to take one or more precalculus courses before tak\u00ad ing calculus, and preparatory courses may be essential before taking statistics. The necessity to take these preparatory courses could seriously delay a student's progress in under\u00ad graduate studies. CATEGORIES OF APPLICATION An undergraduate applicant is a student who wishes to com\u00ad plete a program of studies leading to a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Science degree. A freshman applicant is a student who has graduated from high school or has earned a California Certificate of Profi\u00ad ciency but has not enrolled since then in a regular session of any collegiate-level institution. Summer sessions immediately following graduation are excluded. An advanced standing (transfer) applicant is a high school graduate who has been a registered student in a regular or extension session of a college or university other than a suinmer session immediately following high school graduation. An intercampus transfer applicant is an undergraduate stu\u00ad dent who is currently or was previously registered in a regu\u00ad lar session at another campus of the University of California and has not been registered in another collegiate institution. See page 52. A nonresident applicant is a student whose legal permanent residence (as determined by the University) is outside of the State of California. Nonresident applicants are generally required to pay Nonresident Tuition and must also present a higher grade point average than is required of California res\u00ad idents. Refer to the Nonresident Admission Requirements section for further information. An applicant for readmission is a student.who was formerly registered and enrolled on the Irvine campus and who has interrupted the completion of consecutive quarters of enroll\u00ad ment. See page 52. A second baccalaureate applicant is a college graduate who because of a change of objective wishes to obtain a second bachelor's degree in a major different from that of the first degree. An international applicant is a student who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States. A University Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS) applicant is an accelerated high school student who wishes to register and enroll on a reduced fee basis in UC Irvine courses concurrently with high school courses. ADMISSION TO FRESHMAN STANDING The University defines a freshman applicant as a ~tudent who has graduated from high school or earned a California Certificate of Proficiency and who has not enrolled in a regu\u00ad lar session of any collegiate-level institution. Summer ses\u00ad sions are excluded in the determination. Undergraduate Admissions 31 Freshman applicants who are not residents of California should refer ahead to the section on Nonresident Admission Requirements. NOTE: Applicants still of freshman level and who have com\u00ad pleted more than 12 transferable units since high school graduation should refer to the section on Admission in Advanced Standing. Advanced standing credit will be granted for an acceptable course from an accredited college or university taken while still in high school if completed after the tenth grade and if reported on a valid transcript issued by the college or com\u00ad munity college which conducted the course. Freshmen applicants who have not yet decided on a major should refer to the section on Planning an Undergraduate Program. Requirements To be eligible for admission to the University as a\" freshman, an applicant must meet the Subject, Scholarship, and Exami\u00ad nation requirements. It is also possible to qualify for admis\u00ad sion by examination alone, as explained in the section Admis\u00ad sion by Examination Alone. Subject (\"A Through F\") Requirement Students must complete certain high school courses with at least a grade of C in each semester of each course in the sub\u00ad ject areas listed below. This course sequence is often called \"a through f\" pattern and must appear on a list of courses that high school principals certify meet University requirements. This list is called \"Courses to Meet Requirements for Admis\u00ad sion to the University of California\" and can be obtained from school counselors. The Office of Admissions will determine the equivalency of courses for graduates of out-of\u00ad State high schools. a. History- I year One year* of United States history, or one-half year of United States history and one-half year of civics or American government. b. English-4 years Four years of English:** composition and/or literature, uni\u00ad versity preparatory in nature. Not more than one year course will be accepted from the ninth grade. c. Mathematics-2 years Two years of mathematics: algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, elementary functions, and mathematical analysis. Courses such as arithmetic and business mathematics are not accepted. d. Laboratory- I year A year course in one laboratory science, taken in the tenth, eleventh, or twelfth grade. e. Foreign Language-2 years Two years of one foreign language. Any foreign language with a written literature may be used. A year course in high school is equivalent to one credit/unit. **Only three years of college-preparatory English are required if the applicant completed high school before the end of the 1978-79 aca\u00ad demic year. UC IRVINE - 1982-198332 Undergraduate Admissions f. Advanced Course-1 or 2 years This requirement must be satisfied by one of the following: 1. Mathematics A total of one ye9r of advanced mathematics: intermediate algebra, trigonometry, or other comparable mathematics courses; or, 2. Foreign Language Either an additional year in the same language used for \"e\" above or two years of a second foreign language; or, 3. Science A year course in any laboratory science completed in addi\u00ad tion to the laboratory science used for \"d\" above. The subject requirement can be fulfilled with 11 or 12 high school units. Grades in these courses are the only grades used in calculating the grade point average. However, the University requires all applicants (except those with a Certifi\u00ad cate of Proficiency- see p. 36) to complete at least 16 units. Thus, 3-4 units can be taken in elective courses, which pro\u00ad vide an excellent opportunity to strengthen preparation for the University. Additional courses in mathematics and science are essential in the preparation for majors in engineering, mathematics, the sciences, and many other fields of study. Scholarship Requirement Students who attain a grade point average of 3.30 in \"a-f\" courses taken after the ninth grade will be eligible to enter the University regardless of their scores on standardized tests. Students with grade point averages below 3.30 but greater than 2.77 will be admitted to the University if they achieve specified scores on the standardized test. (See the Eligibility Index.) Grades received in courses taken in the ninth grade or earlier are not used in determining the scholarship average, although subject requirements (except laboratory science) may be satisfied with grades of Cor better in these courses. If students successfully complete more than the minimum units within each required subject, only the best grades are used in calculating their grade point average. Grades are counted on a semester basis unless a school gives only year grades. Students may repeat up to a total of two semester courses (or one year course) in which they receive a grade of D or lower in order to meet the subject and scholarship require\u00ad ments. The grades earned in repeated courses, however, will not be counted higher than C in determining the scholarship average. If the courses students repeat were taken before the tenth grade, they will be treated as if the students were tak\u00ad ing them for the first time. Examination Requirement All freshman applicants must submit test scores as described below. Applicants for admission to the fall quarter should take the tests by December or January of the senior year, if possible. The following tests are required: \u00b7 1. One Aptitude Test-Either: A. The Scholastic Aptitude Test-SAT-(the verbal and mathematics scores submitted from this test must be from the same sitting); or B. The American College Test-ACT- composite score. 2. Three College Board Achievement Tests,* which must include (a) English composition, (b) one from among the social studies or foreign languages, and (c) mathematics (level 1 or 2). *Effective fall quarter, 1983, the three College Board Achievement Tests must include (a) English composition, (b) mathematics (Ievell or 2), and (c) one from among social studies, foreign languages, sciences, or literature. Admission by Examination Alone A student can qualify as a freshman by examination alone. The required total score on the SAT is 1,100. (If ACT is pre\u00ad sented, the minimum score is 26.) Also, the student's total score on the three College Board Achievement Tests must be 1,650 or higher, or at least 1,730 if a nonresident of Califor\u00ad nia, with no score less than 500 on any individual Achieve\u00ad ment Test. If test scores are available to UCI at a time earlier than the evaluation of an applicant's subject and scholarship requirements, and if they meet the above totals, the campus may be able to expedite notification of admission. This option does not apply to students who will have completed more than 12 transferable units prior to admission. The College Board Achievement Tests cannot be taken in academic sub\u00ad jects covered by transferable college courses a student may have taken. Eligibility Index Applicants are admissible if their a-f grade average and test score totals are higher than the combinations below: A\u00b7F ACT* or SAT** A-F ACT* or SAT** GPA Composite Total GPA Composite Total 2.78 35 1600 3.05 22 970 2.79 35 1580 3.06 21 950 2.80 34 1550 3.07 21 920 2.81 34 1530 3.08 20 900 2.82 33 1510 3.09 19 880 2.83 33 1480 3.10 18 850 2.84 33 1460 3.11 18 830 2.85 32 1440 3.12 17 810 2.86 32 1410 3.13 16 780 2.87 32 1390 3.14 15 760 2.88 31 1370 3.15 14 740 2.89 31 1340 3.16 14 710 2.90 30 1320 3.17 13 690 2.91 30 1300 3.18 12 670 2.92 29 1270 3.19 11 640 2.93 29 1250 3.20 10 620 2.94 28 1230 3.21 9 600 2.95 28 1200 3.22 9 570 2.96 27 1180 3.23 8 550 2.97 27 1160 3.24 8 530 2.98 26 1130 3.25 7 500 2.99 26 1110 3.26 7 480 3.00 25 1090 3.27 6 460 3.01 25 1060 3.28 6 430 24 1040 3.29 5 410 24 1020 3.30 5 400 3.04 23 990 *ACT is scored in intervals of 1 point from a minimum of 1 to 35 maximum. **SAT is scored in intervals of 10 points from a minimum of 400 to 1,600 maximum. Admission to the University Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS) The opportunity to enroll in University classes concurrent with the junior or senior year of high school is available to certain accelerated students. Through the University Pro\u00ad gram for High School Scholars (UPHSS), qualified high school students may enroll in UC Irvine courses, receive grades based on the same standards as full-time students, and receive full University of California credit for their work. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983UPHSS is designed to provide the high school student with an enriched education at a substantially advanced level. Stu\u00ad dents are given the opportunity to take courses of interest beyond those which their high schools offer. Along with the academic advantages, students have a chance to experience an early orientation to University life. To continue at UC Irvine after high school graduation, a UPHSS student need only complete a change-of-major peti\u00ad tion and enroll as a full-time student. Also, UPHSS status entitles students to Intercampus Transfer OCT) privileges should they decide to attend another campus of the Univer\u00ad sity of California after high school graduation. High school students wishing more information about the Program should contact the Office of Admissions or their high school counselor. ADMISSION IN ADVANCED STANDING The University defines an advanced standing (transfer) appli\u00ad cant as a high school graduate who has been a registered stu\u00ad dent in another college or university or in college-level exten\u00ad sion classes other than a summer session immediately follow\u00ad ing high school graduation. An advanced standing applicant may not disregard the college record and apply for admission as a freshman. Advanced standing applicants who are not residents of Cali\u00ad fornia should refer to the section on Nonresident Admission Requirements. Advanced Standing Admission Requirements The requirements for admission in advanced standing vary according to the high school record. Advanced standing appli\u00ad cants who have a California Certificate of Proficiency must also meet regular University entrance requirements. The high school eligibility for advanced standing applicants will be determined by one of the following, depending on the high school graduation date: (1) students graduating from high school June 1979 or later are eligible if they meet the Eligibil\u00ad ity Index (p. 32); (2) students graduating from high school before June 1979 are eligible if they have earned a 3.0 grade point average on the required high school subjects. In any case, if fewer than 12 units have been completed since high school graduation, the examination requirements for fresh\u00ad men also apply. Nonresident applicants must also meet addi\u00ad tional requirements discussed in the section on Nonresident Admission Requirements. The transcript submitted from the last college attended must show, as a minimum, that the student was in good standing and had earned a grade point average1 of 2.00 or better. If the grade point average fell below 2.00 at any one college attended, the student may have to meet additional require\u00ad ments in order to qualify for admission. An advanced standing applicant must also meet one of the following conditions: 1. A student who met the Eligibility Index or whose high school scholarship average in the required subjects was 3.00 1The grade point average is determined by dividing the total number of acceptable units attempted into the number of grade points earned on those units. A student may repeat courses com\u00ad pleted with a grade lower than C up to a maximum of 16 quarter units without penalty. The scholarship standard is expressed by a system of grade points and grade point averages earned in courses accepted by the Uni\u00ad versity for advanced standing credit. Grade points are assigned as follows: for each unit of A, 4 points; B, 3 points; C, 2 points; D, 1 point; I and F, no' points; P/NP, no points but are included in the unit total. Undergraduate Admissions 33 or better may be admitted any time after establishing an overall grade point average of 2.00 or better. If a student has completed less than 12 quarter or semester units of transfer\u00ad able college credit since high school graduation, the student must also satisfy the examination requirement for freshmen. 2. A student who met the Eligibility Index or whose high school scholarship average in the required subjects was 3.00 or better but had not studied one or more of the required courses in high school may be admitted after the student has: a. established an overall grade point average of 2.00 or better in another college or university; and b. completed, with a grade of Cor better, appropriate college courses in the high school subjects lacked;'and c. completed 12 or more quarter or semester transferable units, or met the examination requirement. 3. A student who was not eligible for admission as a fresh\u00ad man because (a) the Eligibility Index was not met and the student lacked the required subjects, or (b) because of low scholarship or a combination of low scholarship and a lack of required subjects, may be admitted after the student has: a. established an overall grade point average of 2.40 or better in another college or university; and b. completed 84 quarter units (56 semester units) of college credit in courses accepted by the University for transfer; and c. completed, with a grade of Cor better, appropriate college courses in high school subjects that the student lacked (high school deficiencies equivalent to two one-year courses may be waived) or completed, with a grade of C or better, (1) one col\u00ad lege course in mathematics at least as advanced as the equiva\u00ad lent of two years of high school algebra or one year of alge\u00ad bra and one year of geometry, (2) one course in English of a level transferable to the University of California, and (3) one course in U.S. history, a laboratory science, or a foreign lan\u00ad guage which is transferable to the University of California. Admission for a Second Bachelor's Degree Some students may wish to obtain a second bachelor's degree in a major different from that of the first degree. Admission as a candidate for a second bachelor's degree requires that the applicant be fully eligible for admission to the University and have strong promise of academic success in the new major. All such admissions are subject to the approval of the dean or director of the UCI school or pro\u00ad gram in which the second degree will be earned. . Students who have not attended UCI as undergraduates during a regular academic quarter should complete an Application for Undergraduate Admission and a Supplemen\u00ad tary Information for Second Baccalaureate Applicants form, available from the Office of Admissions. Students who have attended UCI as undergraduates during a regular academic quarter should obtain and complete a Second Baccalaureate Application form through the Registrar's Office. NONRESIDENT ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS NOTE: Admission requirements for applicants who are not California residents vary slightly from requirements for California residents. UC IRVINE - 1982-198334 Undergraduate Admissions Nonresident Freshman Applicant A nonresident freshman applicant must (I) graduate from a regionally or state-accredited high school; (2) complete satis\u00ad factorily the \"a through f\" pattern of subject requirements listed under requirements for California residents; (3) earn a grade point average of at least 3.40 or higher in the required high school subjects (3.00 is equal to a B average); and (4) meet the examination requirement: one Aptitude Test\u00ad either the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) (verbal and mathematics scores must be from the same sitting) or the American College Test (ACT) composite score-AND three College Board Achievement Tests* which must include Eng\u00ad lish composition; social studies or foreign language; and mathematics (level I or 2). Please note that the Freshman Eligibility Index applies to California residents only. To be admitted by examination alone, a nonresident applicant must score either I,IOO on the Scholastic Aptitude Test or 26 on the American College Test. The total score on the three College Board Achievement Tests must be I,730 or higher with a score of at least 500 on each test. Nonresident Advanced Standing Applicant A student who met the admission requirements for freshman admission as a nonresident must have a grade point average of 2.80 or higher in college courses that are accepted by the University for transfer credit. A nonresident applicant who graduated from high school with less than a 3.40 grade point average in the subjects required for freshman admission must have completed at least 84 quarter units (56 semester units) of transferable work with a grade point average of 2.80 or higher. Upon suc\u00ad cessful completion of that work, two units of the required high school subjects may be waived. A student who lacked any of the required subjects in high school must complete, with a grade of Cor better, appropriate college courses in those subjects, or (I) one college course in mathematics at least as advanced as the equivalent of two years of high school algebra or one year of algebra and one year of geome\u00ad try, (2) one course in English of a level transferable to the University of California, and (3) one course in U.S. history, a laboratory science, or a foreign language which is transfer\u00ad able to the University of California. Exceptions to Nonresident Admission Requirements For admission purposes only, a person residing outside of Cali\u00ad fornia may be determined by the Office of Admissions to be a bona fide resident and may be considered under California resident admission requirements if the applicant: is a spouse of a University of California faculty member; is a spouse of military personnel assigned to California; is a military dependent who has been granted a nonresident fee waiver; is an immigrant who has lived in California for a year and has chosen California as a place of residence; is a minor applicant whose parent or legal guardian appears to be a legal resident of California (as determined by the University for tuition purposes); has spent any two years or the last term enrolled in a California high school; has spent the last term (in at least I2 transferable units) enrolled in an accredited California col\u00ad lege or university; has been physically present in California continuously for at least one year prior to the quarter for which registration is requested; or if one parent has received *Effective fall quarter, 1983, the three College Board Achievement Tests must include (a) English composition, (b) mathematics (level 1 \u00b7or 2), and (c) one from among social studies, foreign languages, sciences, or literature. a degree from the University of California or is a full-time employee of the University of California. Nonresident Tuition Fee Refer to page 48 for information regarding residence classifi\u00ad cation for tuition purposes and the Nonresident Tuition Fee. Bona fide residents are still held for Nonresident Tuition. ADMISSION OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS The credentials of an international undergraduate applicant\u00ad a student who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States-are evaluated in accordance with the gen\u00ad eral regulations governing admission. An application, official certificates, and detailed transcripts of records should be submitted to the Office of Admissions early in the appro\u00ad priate application filing period. This will allow time for exchange of necessary correspondence and, if the applicant is admitted, will help the student in obtaining the necessary passport visa. International applicants whose native language is other than English will be required to demonstrate their English profi\u00ad ciency. This is most often accomplished by achieving a min\u00ad imum score of 550 on the Test of English as a Foreign Lan\u00ad guage (TOEFL). The admission of otherwise eligible appli\u00ad cants who do not meet this requirement will be deferred until it is possible for them to demonstrate an adequate level of English ability. Arrangements to take the TOEFL may be made by writing directly to TOEFL, Educational Testing Ser\u00ad vice, P.O. Box 899, Princeton, New Jersy 08540. Students must request the Educational Testing Service to forward results of their tests to the Office of Admissions. Completion of an acceptable English composition course (as determined by the Office of Admissions) with a grade of Cor better will also clear the English proficiency requirement for interna\u00ad tional applicants. In addition to achieving a minimum TOEFL score of 550, all international students must take an English as a Second Lan\u00ad guage Placement Test upon arrival and prior to registration. Based upon the results of this test, students may be required to improve certain language skills by enrolling in English as a Second Language courses during the freshman year with other major course work being adjusted accordingly. Generally, financial assistance and scholarships from the Uni\u00ad versity are not available to the nonimmigrant-visa student. International students must provide proof that sufficient funds will be available to meet their educational commit\u00ad ments while studying in the United States. International undergraduate students are considered as nonresidents of California and are required to pay the nonresident tuition in addition to fees paid by legal residents of California. Please direct all inquiries regarding the undergraduate admis\u00ad sion of international students to the Office of Admissions. English Language Proficiency of Permanent Resident, Refugee, and International (F-1 Visa) Students Any permanent resident, refugee, or international student whose first or native language is other than English and who has a score on the verbal section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) of 350 or less, or any such student without aver\u00ad bal SAT score, must, regardless of the student's TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score, take an English as a Second Language Placement Test prior to the first quarter of enrollment. Based upon the results of this test, students may be required to improve certain language skills by enrolling in UC IRVINE - 1982-1983English as a Second Language courses during their first year of enrollment and prior to enrolling in any other writing courses. This English as a Second Language Placement Test will be conducted by the staff in the Office of English as a Second Language, School of Humanities, prior to the begin\u00ad ning of each quarter. Information concerning exact times, locations, and a description of the placement test can be obtained by contacting the Office at (714) 833-6781. Credit for Native Language Students whose first language is not English may receive credit for course work in their native language and literature, provided such courses were completed on the college level in the country of the vernacular, or on the upper-division or graduate level at UCI or another accredited English-speaking institution. APPLICATION PROCEDURES Application Filing Periods Application packets for undergraduate admission to the Uni\u00ad versity are available from the counseling office of any Cali\u00ad fornia high school or community college, or from any Uni\u00ad versity of California Admissions Office. Submit completed application and related materials to the Office of Admissions, 245 Administration Building, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717 on or after the appropriate date below: Winter quarter, I983 Spring quarter, I983 Fall quarter, I983 Winter quarter, I984 Spring quarter, I984 July I, I982 October I, I982 November I, I982 July I, I983 October I, I983 The beginning of the application filing period is the same for \u00b7all campuses. Each campus will accept for consideration all applications filed during the first month of the filing period. After the first month the closing deadline will vary from campus to campus. Students are encouraged to file their applications early in the filing period to be assured considera\u00ad tion for the program and campus of their choice. Once en\u00ad rollment quotas have been filled, additional applications can\u00ad not be accepted and will be directed to another University campus where enrollments are still open, according to prefer\u00ad ences shown on the application. Application Fee There is a nonrefundable fee of $25 for filing an application for admission. Checks or money orders should be made payable to Regents-UC and attached to the application form. Change of Campus If, after applying for admission, the student's plans change and he or she prefers to attend a different campus of the University, the student should write to the Admissions Office of the preferred campus. The student's letter should state (I) the student's intended major, (2) the quarter or semester for which the student is applying, (3) the level for which the student is applying (whether freshman or advanced standing), (4) the name of the campus to which the student originally applied, and (5) the reasons the student wishes to change to a campus different from the one origi\u00ad nally applied for. Processing a change-of-campus preference takes several weeks. However, the student's admission priority will be assigned based on the date the student's request for a change was made. The student should be aware that special program commitments (such as the Educational Opportunity Program or UCLA's Academic Advancement Program) do not transfer from one campus to another. Undergraduate Admissions 35 NOTE: If the student requested housing or financial aid information at the originally chosen campus, the student should inquire of the new campus housing and financial aid offices whether pertinent records have been transferred and about priorities, deadlines, and availability of financial aid and housing. Transcripts The Office of Admissions requires complete, accurate, and up-to-date information about a student's academic program and work in progress in order to process and respond to the application in a timely manner. All applicants are responsible for requesting that the high schools from which they graduated and each college attended send official transcripts of work promptly to the UCI Office of Admissions. If a student is applying for admission as a freshman, a pre\u00ad liminary transcript showing work through the junior year should be requested from the high school. The transcript should list the courses the student is now taking and those the student plans to take. A final transcript that includes courses and grades for the senior year and a statement of graduation or a California Certificate of Proficiency must also be provided. A transcript from the last college attended is required if any college courses are completed before or at the time of high school graduation. Those applying for admission in advanced standing should have their graduating high school send a transcript im\u00ad mediately to the Office of Admissions which will also need a transcript from each college attended. A preliminary tran\u00ad script from the present college should list the courses cur\u00ad rently in progress and those planned before transfer. Attendance at any other schools or colleges after application to the University has been filed is considered to be part of the record and must be reported to the Office of Admissions. The transcript and other documents submitted as part of the application become the property of the University; they can\u00ad not be returned or forwarded in any form to another college or university. Examination Arrangements Students should make arrangements to take the required tests with the College Board, I947 Center Street, Berkeley, California 94704, or P.O. Box 592, Princeton, New Jersey 08540 for SAT and Achievement Tests. For the ACT, stu\u00ad dents should write to the American College Testing Program Registration Unit, P.O. Box I68, Iowa City, Iowa 52240. (Test fees should be paid to the testing services, not the Univer\u00ad sity.) Test scores will be regarded as official only if they are reported directly to the Office of Admissions by the Educa\u00ad tional Testing Service or by the American College Testing Program. Also, final notification of admission cannot be released until scores have been received by the Office of Admissions. In I982-83 SAT and Achievement Tests will be offered con\u00ad currently on the following Saturday mornings: October I6, I982 (SAT only January 22, I983 in California, Florida, Georgia, March I9, I983 (SAT only) Illinois, New York, North Caro- Ma 7 I983 lina, and Texas) Y ' November 6, 1982 June 4' I983 December 4, I982 UC IRVINE - 1982-198336 Undergraduate Admissions The 1982-83 ACT Tests will be offered on the following dates: October 30, 1982 December 11, 1982 February 12, 1983 April16, 1983 June 11, 1983 Details on testing are available from the College Board, the American College Testing Program, and from most high school counseling offices. Notification of Admission Candidates for the fall quarter will be notified whether their applications have been retained for consideration at UCI immediately after they are received. Most candidates who applied early in the filing period will receive notice of their admissibility by April 15. (There are similar notification peri\u00ad ods for other quarters.) Delays will occur if required records have not been received by the Office of Admissions. Since each application is considered individually, the length of time before notification is subject to some variation depending upon the unique circumstances of each applicant. If offered admission by the University, a student will be asked to sign and return a Statement of Intention to Register, accompanied by a nonrefundable fee of $50. This amount will be applied toward payment of University fees, provided the student enrolls in the quarter to which the student has been admitted. Admission to UCI is not an assurance of financial aid nor does it guarantee assignment to University housing. Separate applications are required of applicants desiring financial aid or University hous\u00ad ing, and receipt of communications from the Financial Aid or Housing Office does not imply that eligibility for admission has been established. Reapplication and Deferred Admission Privilege In general, an application for admission is effective only for the quarter for which it is submitted. If a student is not eligi\u00ad ble for admission, or if a student is admitted and does not enroll, the student must file a new application with the required fee in order to be considered for admission to another quarter. The new application will be considered in light of the admission requirements in effect and the space available on the campus. However, qualified applicants for undergraduate admission may request to have their admission deferred until a later quarter. Requests for admission deferment should be addressed to the Director of Admissions. Every consideration will be given to deferments requested for valid reasons, though applicants should be aware that responses to such requests may vary from quarter to quarter or major to major due to changing enrollment conditions. Educational Opportunity Program Applicants who wish to be considered for the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) should refer to page 54 for sup\u00ad plementary application procedures. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Recommended Subjects Many University programs require or recommend specific preparatory subjects to give students the needed background in their chosen fields of study. The lack of such preparation, particularly for advanced standing students, may delay graduation from the University. Details about these recom\u00ad mendations can be found in Prerequisites and Recommended Subjects, a University publication sent each year to high school and community college counselors. Subject A and American History and Institutions To be eligible for a bachelor's degree .from UC Irvine, stu\u00ad dents must meet a number of requirements, including those of the University of California, the Irvine campus, and the individual school and major. There are two requirements\u00ad Subject A (English Composition) and American History and Institutions-which all University of California students must satisfy in order to graduate. For specific information on these requirements and ways to satisfy them before entrance to UCI, refer to page 12. College-Level Courses The University gives unit credit to students for courses they have completed in other accredited colleges or universities. To be accepted for unit credit, the courses must be consistent with those offered by the University. All applicants with questions regarding transfer of credit should contact the Office of Admissions. College Level Examination Program (CLEP) Effective fall 1981, the University discontinued granting credit for both the general and subject examinations of the College Level Examination Program. Advanced Placement The Advanced Placement Examinations of the College Board are taken, usually during the senior year, in conjunction with courses taken in high school. Students will receive 10 quarter units of University credit for each examination (except Latin, Physics C, Part 1, 2, and Mathematics AB which earn five quarter units each) in which they earn a score of 5, 4, or 3. A maximum of 10 units can be earned for the following: a com\u00ad bination of Physics Band Physics C; English Language and Composition and English Composition and Literature if both examinations are presented; in Studio Art a student may submit either a General Portfolio or a Drawing Portfolio, but not both. These credits will apply toward the total required for graduation from the University. Information about spe\u00ad cific application of Advanced Placement toward subject credit may be obtained from the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges. High School Proficiency Examination The University of California will accept the California Certif\u00ad icate of Proficiency, awarded by the State Department of Education upon successful completion of the California High School Proficiency Examination, in lieu of the regular high school diploma. However, all other University entrance requirements (subject pattern, grades, tests) must be met. The date of high school graduation on University records will be the date of the certificate. Entrance by standardized test scores will remain an option for the student ineligible on the basis of high school record. Physical Examination All new students and those returning after an absence of two or more quarters require physical examinations and health clearances, respectively, before the first day of the quarter. See Student Health. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983PLANNING FOR TRANSFER TO UCI The University is committed to serve as fully as possible the educational needs of students who transfer from other Cali\u00ad fornia collegiate institutions. The principles covering transferability of unit credit and course credit are explained below and, unless otherwise indicated, are much the same whether transfer is from a two-year or a four-year institu\u00ad tion. Information regarding eligibility for transfer may be found in the section on Admission in Advanced Standing, page 33. Unit Credit for Work Taken Elsewhere The University of California grants unit credit for courses completed in other accredited colleges and universities when such courses are consistent with the functions of the Univer\u00ad sity as set forth in the Master Plan for Higher Education in California. Equivalent advanced standing credit from institu\u00ad tions on the semester calendar may be determined at a ratio of one semester unit to one and one-half quarter units. (To graduate from UCI 180 quarter units, equivalent to 45 UCI quarter courses, are .needed.) California Community Colleges Students may find it advantageous or necessary to complete the first two years of a University of California undergradu\u00ad ate program at one of the California Community Colleges, which are an integral part of the State's system of higher education. High school graduates who cannot be accommo\u00ad dated at their first University of California campus prefer\u00ad ence may choose to attend a community college and transfer to their preferred University campus at a later time. A stu\u00ad dent may earn a maximum of 105 quarter units (70 semester units) toward a University degree in a community college. No further unit credit may be transferred from a community col\u00ad lege, although subject, major, or breadth credit for courses taken will still be granted. Students anticipating transfer to UCI are urged to consult with their community college counselors. The community college counselor, with the aid of that college's transferable course list, can advise students about courses which will transfer to the University. Lists for each community college are updated annually and tell which courses will transfer and for how many units. In addition to the community college counselor, staff in the Office of Admissions and Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges keep current copies and can advise students about the transferability of courses. Four-Year Institutions Unit credit is granted for courses consistent with the Univer\u00ad sity of California's functions and which have been completed in colleges or universities accredited by the appropriate agen\u00ad cies. While limitations of credit may be imposed in certain subject areas, these are consonant with the curricula for all students in the University of California. No defined maxi\u00ad mum number of units which can be earned toward the degree is set for students transferring from four-year institu\u00ad tions. However, see page 13 for UCI graduation require\u00ad ments, including requirements for units earned in residence at this campus. University of California Extension Extension courses prefixed by XB, XD, XI, XR, XSB, and XSD are granted unit credit on the same basis as courses taken in residence at any accredited collegiate institution. Students intending to transfer Extension course credit for a degree at another college or university should verify accep\u00ad tance of the course with that institution. Resident students of the University of California must obtain the consent of the Undergraduate Admissions 37 dean of their school or college prior to enrolling for credit in an Extension course. Extension courses are not accepted as part of the residence requirements of the University. Grades earned in University Extension are not used in calculating the University grade point average. Decisions regarding the acceptability of extension courses taken in institutions other than the University of California rest with the Office of Admissions. Decisions regarding the applicability of such courses toward specific degrees and majors rest with the respective faculties. Course Credit for Work Taken Elsewhere The policies above refer only to the unit transferability of courses and are uniformly implemented on all campuses of the University. Thus, courses which are determined by the University of California to be transferable are assured only of being granted elective course credit. The application of transfer work to specific course and major requirements is determined by the student's academic dean. The Irvine campus makes every effort to eliminate all bar\u00ad riers to orderly progress from California community colleges into UCI's programs. To this end, many community colleges UC IRVINE - 1982-198338 Planning For Transfer to UCI have entered into articulation agreements with UCI so that the specific application of their courses to UCI's University, school, and departmental major requirements may be readily communicated to prospective transfer students. Students are urged to consult community college counselors or the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges for specific informa\u00ad tion on planning a program for transfer. The University of California bulletin Prerequisites and Recommended Subjects should also be consulted for planning the lower-division course of study for all programs offered on the campuses of the University of California. Requirements Requirements at UCI are in four categories: University of California, UCI, school, and departmental or major. Courses not specifically applicable to these are considered to be elec\u00ad tives. See pages 12-14 for a description of these requirements. University of California Requirements: Subject A and American History and Institutions Among the means of meeting the Subject A requirement is the completion of an acceptable one-quarter (four units) or one-semester (three units) transfer course in English com\u00ad position with a grade of Cor better. The American History and Institutions requirement may be met by completing in high school one year of U.S. history or one semester of U.S. history and one semester of U.S. government with a grade of at least Cor upon certification by another California collegiate institution. UCI Breadth Requirement The current UCI breadth requirement applies to new stu\u00ad dents who entered UCI or any other accredited college fall term, 1980, and thereafter. Transfer students who sub\u00ad sequent to high school graduation attended a regular term in an accredited college any time prior to fall 1980 have the option of satisfying this requirement through (1) the UCI 6- 3-3 distribution (see below), (2) the current UCI breadth requirement, which must be completed prior to graduation, or (3) one of the other options indicated below. The breadth requirement, which must be completed prior to graduation, may be satisfied by college-level courses appropriate to UCI offerings and may be met at any lime during the undergradu\u00ad ate years, except in the case of the upper-division Writing re\u00ad quirement. Transfer students should not feel that the breadth requirement must necessarily be completed in the lower division. See page 13 for details on the breadth requirement. Students who transfer from a four-year institution and who have completed the general breadth requirements of that col\u00ad lege will be considered to have met the total breadth require\u00ad ment of UCI. Students who transfer from a community col\u00ad lege and who have met the general breadth requirements of any campus of the University of California prior to transfer will also be regarded as having met the breadth requirement. Students who, upon transfer, have not completed whatever breadth requirements may have been in progress for another campus of the University of California may elect to complete at UCI either that program or whatever UCI breadth require\u00ad ment is applicable to them-the UCI 6-3-3 distribution or the new UCI breadth requirement. Students who transfer from colleges on the semester calendar and who elect to satisfy the breadth requirement by fulfilling the UCI 6-3-3 distribution may do so by completing four semester courses (minimum 12 semester units) in one school outside the major and two semester courses (min-imum six semester units) in each of two other schools out\u00ad side the major. Students transferring from another institution who first at\u00ad tended college in fall1980 or thereafter may satisfy the new UCI breadth requirement (p. 13) by completing a year se\u00ad quence (two semesters work, minimum six semester units, or three quarters work, minimum 12 quarter units) in each of the following areas: I. Writing II. Natural Sciences III. Social and Behavioral Sciences IV. Humanistic Inquiry V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, or Computer Science Students transferring to UCI should refer to the following detailed guidelines on how to satisfy the breadth requirement in each area: I. Writing. The lower-division writing requirement may be met by a year sequence in English composition. Courses used to meet the lower-division writing requirement must be com\u00ad pleted with a minimum grade of C-(1.7), or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C-. Transfer students may not count any course designed exclusively for the satisfaction of Subject A toward the completion of the lower-division requirement. Any student entering with only one semester or one quarter of English composition through which the Subject A Requirement is fulfilled will not have satisfied any part of the writing requirement. The upper-division writing require\u00ad ment normally should be completed at Irvine. II. Natural Sciences. This requirement may be met by a year sequence in one of the following areas: general biology, gen\u00ad eral chemistry, basic physics, the physical sciences with the exception of mathematics. These courses may or may not include a laboratory. III. Social and Behavorial Sciences. This requirement may be met by a year of work in any of the following areas: anthro\u00ad pology and comparative culture, economics, political science, psychology, sociology, or social ecology. Students on the semester system may elect to take both courses in the same area or one course from each of any two areas; students on the quarter system may elect to take three courses in one area, or two courses from one area and a third from another area. History, for the purposes of the breadth requirement, is not considered a social or behavioral science. (See IV, Human\u00ad istic Inquiry.) IV. Humanistic Inquiry. This requirement may be met by a year sequence in one of the following areas: classics, history, philosophy, humanities, English literature, comparative litera\u00ad ture, dramatic literature, art history, history of music, nature and theory of art. Performance courses may not be used in satisfaction of this requirement. V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, Com\u00ad puter Science. This requirement may be met by a year sequence in one of the following areas: probability and statis\u00ad tics, calculus, logic, linguistics, computer science, or comple\u00ad tion of the second year in a foreign language. In satisfying the above requirements, a student may count toward breadth no more than a year of work taken within the discipline of the major. For example, a student majoring in Philosophy may count no more than two semester courses or three quarter courses in Philosophy toward breadth. Transfer students should check with the academic counselor in their prospective major, the Office of Admissions, or the UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges about courses that may be used to satisfy the UCI breadth requirement. A complete description of the breadth requirement is on page 13. NOTE FOR PHYSICAL SCIENCES MAJORS: In addition to the courses taken to fulfull the UCI breadth requirement, students majoring in the School of Physical Sciences are required to take one additional year sequence from one of the following breadth areas: Social and Behavioral Sciences (III), Humanistic Inquiry (IV), or the Foreign-Languages or Lin\u00ad guistics section of Category V. For purposes of this require\u00ad ment, the approved sequences are the same ones listed for the UCI breadth requirement, with the exception that a year sequence of a single foreign language at the first level is acceptable. NOTE FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES MAJORS: By satisfy\u00ad ing the lower-division Writing requirement (I) and complet\u00ad ing a year sequence of courses selected from classics, history, philosophy, humanities, English literature, or comparative literature toward the Humanistic Inquiry (IV) breadth requirement, students majoring in Biological Sciences can also satisfy the Humanities requirement for their major. The courses and descriptions listed elsewhere in this Cata\u00ad logue may be used by prospective transfer students as a guide for selecting courses of similar content and purpose in their own institutions. However, it is strongly advised that they consult with their counselors to verify the transferabil\u00ad ity of such courses and the applicability to the breadth requirement. No student who has taken a course which is accepted for credit by the Office of Admissions and which has been determined by a community college as acceptable toward completion of the breadth requirement shall incur any loss of credit in satisfaction of the requirement. School Requirements Since school requirements occasionally cross school lines (e.g., physical science requirements for all majors in the School of Biological Sciences), courses taken to fulfill a school requirement may at the same time be applicable toward the University breadth requirement unless the school designates otherwise. Also, courses taken to fulfill a departmental major requirement may at the same time fulfill a school require\u00ad ment or, within prescribed limits, the University breadth requirement. Although course equivalencies for the breadth requirement are liberally interpreted for purposes of transfer, courses to be applied toward school and departmental major require\u00ad ments must be more precisely equated with UCI courses in unit value and in content~ By careful selection of courses, it is possible for students to satisfy some or all of the lower\u00ad division requirements of their intended program or school prior to transfer. Departmental or Major Requirements Courses to be applied toward departmental or major require\u00ad ments must be more precisely equated with UCI courses in content and purpose than is the case with courses applicable to the breadth requirement (seep. IS and departmental sec\u00ad tions). Prospective transfer students should consult with their counselors as to the applicability of courses toward UCI requirements. Prospective transfer students should address specific inquir\u00ad ies about their programs to the respective schools or depart\u00ad ments at UCI. Community colleges wishing to clarify the status of transfer courses should consult with the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges at Irvine or the Univer\u00ad sity of California campus closest to them. FEES, EXPENSES, AND FINANCIAL AID , ~ ESTIMATED EXPENSES NOTE: Undergraduate and graduate estimated figures are based on three quarters of attendance. Figures for first-year medical students are based on 10 months of attendance and are higher for second-through four-year students, who attend for a calendar year. All fees are subject to change without notice and the University may impose additional fees. The following is intended only as a guide in computing average expenses. Fee payment dates are announced in the quarterly Schedule of Classes. Special Expenditures Special expenditures beyond the cost of books and basic sup\u00ad plies may be associated with certain courses of study. For example, field study assignments may involve transportation expenses; students who take a dance class may be required to wear a certain type of shoe; a student may need a calculator. A student who has special expenses associated with a course should make an appointment to see a financial aid advisor. FEES Under terms of the Alan Pattee Scholarship Act a surviving child of a California resident who died as a result of accident or injury incurred in the performance of active law enforce\u00ad ment or active fire suppression and prevention duties is eligi\u00ad ble to apply for waiver of certain fees. Additional information concerning this Act is available from the Registrar's Office. Registration Fee The University Registration Fee is $170 per quarter. The full fee is required of all students regardless of the number of courses taken. This fee, which must be paid at the time of registration, is a charge to each student for services which benefit the student and which are complementary to, but not a part of, the instructional programs. No part of this fee is remitted to students who may not desire to make use of all or any of these services. Graduate students studying out of the State may be eligible to pay one-half of the Registration Fee.

For nonresidents of California, the above costs apply, plus $3,150 Nonresident Tuition. 1These budgets are estimates only and are intended to be used as a guide to help students plan for meeting the costs of attendance at UCI. 2Refer to the chart below for a breakdown of fees. 'Actual costs will depend upon a student's program. Based on costs for a first-year medical student attending for 10 months; average costs for each of the second through fourth years is currently estimated to be $11,253. The $50 advance deposit on the Registration Fee (Under\u00ad graduate Acceptance of Admission Fee), required of new undergraduates, is applied to the full fee when the student registers. Continuing students are required to pay all out\u00ad standing fines and other debts, in full, at the time they pay their Registration Fee for an upcoming term. Medical students are required to pay the full Registration Fee for each fall, winter, and spring quarter, and a reduced Regis\u00ad tration Fee for each summer quarter. As of spring 1982, the fee for summer quarter, 1982, is $80. Educational Fee The fall quarter Educational Fee for undergraduate students is $209; for winter and spring quarters it is $208 each quar\u00ad ter. For graduate students the Educational Fee is $229 for fall quarter and $228 each for winter and spring quarters. Legal residents of the State of California with demonstrated finan\u00ad cial need may defer payment of the Educational Fee by accepting obligation to repay, at a later date, the sum deferred. Students interested in this provision should contact the Financial Aid Office, 102 Administration Building. Medical students are required to pay the Educational Fee for each quarter in which they enroll, including the summer quarter. Part-Time Status Undergraduate and graduate students on approved part-time status (enrollment in 10 units or less per quarter for under\u00ad graduates and in eight units or less per quarter for graduate students) pay the full University Registration Fee and one\u00ad half the Educational Fee paid by students on full-time status. Those part-time students who also have been determined to be nonresidents of the State of California also are assessed one-half the Nonresident Tuition, in addition to the Registra\u00ad tion and Educational Fees. Students seeking part-time status must obtain the approval of the appropriate academic dean, and part-time status can be granted only for reasons of financial need, health, or family responsibilities. Part-time status lapses at the end of each academic year. A student must, therefore, reapply each year that part-time status is desired.

Nonresident Tuition Fee and California Residence Students who have not been residents of California for more than one year immediately prior to the residence determina\u00ad tion date are charged, along with other fees, a Nonresident Tuition Fee of $1,050 for each quarter or $3,150 per year for each year of attendance required by the curriculum, whether such year extends over three or four academic quarters. The residence determination date is the day instruction begins at the last of the University of California campuses to open for the quarter, and for schools on the semester system, the day instruction begins for the semester. Nonresident undergrad\u00ad uate and graduate students on approved part-time status shall pay one-half the Nonresident Tuition. Inquiries from prospective students regarding residence requirements for tuition purposes should be directed to the Residence Deputy. No other University personnel are auth\u00ad orized to supply information relative to residence require\u00ad ments for tuition purposes. Any student, following a final decision on residence classification by the Residence Deputy, may make written appeal to the Legal Analyst-Residence Matters (590 University Hall, University of California, 2200 University Avenue, Berkeley, California 94720) within 120 days after notification of the final decision by the Residence Deputy. General In order to be classified as a resident for tuition purposes upon admission, an adult student must have established his or her residence in California for more than one year im-Fees, Expenses, and Financial Aid 41 mediately preceding the residence determination date for the term during which the student proposes to attend the Uni\u00ad versity and relinquish any prior residence. An adult student must couple his or her physical presence within the State of California for one year with objective evidence that such presence is consistent with the student's intent in making California his or her permanent home and, if these steps are delayed, the one-year durational period will be extended until BOTH presence and intent have been demonstrated for one full year. Physical presence within the State solely for educa\u00ad tional purposes does not constitute the establishment of Cali\u00ad fornia residence under State law regardless of the length of the student's stay in California. Relevant indicia which can be relied upon to demonstrate one's intent to make California his or her permanent resi\u00ad dence include, but are not limited to, the following: register\u00ad ing and voting in California elections; designating California as the student's permanent address on all school and employ\u00ad ment records, including military records if one is in the mil\u00ad itary service; obtail)ing a California driver's license or Cali\u00ad Identification Card, if a nondriver; obtaining California vehicle registration; paying California income taxes as a resi\u00ad dent, including income earned outside the State; establishing an abode where one's permanent belongings are kept within California; licensing for professional practice in California; and the absence of these indicia in other states during any period for which residence in California is asserted. Docu\u00ad mentary evidence may be required. No single factor is con\u00ad trolling or decisive. All relevent indicia will be considered in the classification determination. The residence of the parent with whom an unmarried minor (under age 18) child maintains his or her place of abode is the residence of the unmarried minor child. When the minor lives with neither parent his or her residence is that of the parent with whom he or she maintained his or her last place of abode, provided the minor may establish his or her resi\u00ad dence when both parents are deceased and a legal guardian has not been appointed. The residence of an unmarried minor who has a parent living cannot be changed by his or her own act, by the appointment of a legal guardian, or by relinquishment of a parent's right of control. A man or a women establishes his' or her residence. A woman's residence shall not be derivative from that of her husband, or vice versa. ' Procedures New and returning students are required to complete a Statement of Legal Residence. The student's status is deter\u00ad mined by the Residence Deputy who is located in the Regis\u00ad trar's Office. All students classified incorrectly as residents are subject to reclassification and to payment of all nonresident fees not paid. If incorrect classification results from false or concealed facts by the student, the student also is subject to University discipline. Resident students who become nonresidents must immediately notify the Residence Deputy. Exceptions 1. A student who remains in this State after his or her par\u00ad ent, who was theretofore domiciled in California for at least one year immediately prior to leaving and has, during the student's minority and within one year immediately prior to the residence determination date, established residence elsE:\u00ad where, shall be entitled to resident classification until the student has attained the age of majority and has resided in UC IRVINE - 1982-198342 Fees, Expenses, and Financial Aid the State the minimum time necessary to become a resident so long as, once enrolled, he or she maintains continuous attendance at an institution. 2. Nonresident students who are minors or 18 years of age and can evidence that they have been totally self-supporting through employment and actually present within California for the entire year immediately prior to the residence deter\u00ad mination date and have evidenced the intent to make Cali\u00ad fornia their permanent home may be eligible for resident status. 3. A student shall be entitled to resident classification if immediately prior to the residence determination date he or she has lived with and been under the continuous direct care and control of any adult or adults other than a parent for not less than two years, provided that the adult or adults having such control have been California residents during the year immediately prior to the residence determination date. This exception continues until the student has attained the age of majority and has resided in the State the minimum time necessary to become a resident student, so long as continu\u00ad ous attendance is maintained at an institution. 4. Exemption from payment of the Nonresident Tuition Fee is available to the natural or adopted child, stepchild, or spouse who is a dependent of a member of the United States military stationed in California on active duty. Such resident classification may be maintained until the student has resided in California the minimum time necessary to become a resi\u00ad dent. If a student is enrolled in an institution and the member of the military (a) is transferred on military orders to a place outside the state where the member continues to serve in the armed forces of the United States, or (b) is retired as an active member of the armed forces immediately after having been on active duty in California, the student is entitled to retain resident classification under conditions set forth above. 5. A student who is a member of the United States military stationed in California on active duty, except a member of the military assigned for educational purposes to a State\u00ad supported institution of higher education, shall be entitled to resident classification until he or she has resided in the State the minimum time necessary to become a resident. 6. A student who is an adult alien is entitled to resident clas\u00ad sification if the student has been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence in accordance with all applicable provisions of the laws of the United States and has thereafter established and maintained residence in California for more than one year immediately prior to the residence determination date. Nonimmigrant aliens having visa classifi\u00ad cations A E, G, I, or K should consult the Residence Deputy in the Registrar's Office for further information about their ability to become California residents for tuition purposes. 7. A student who is a minor alien shall be entitled to resident classification if the student and the parent from whom resi\u00ad dence is derived have been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence, provided that the parent has had residence in California for more than one year after admission to permanent residence prior to the residence determination date for the term. As of June 30, 1980, those sections of the California Educa\u00ad tion Code which gave refugee students the ability to be Cali\u00ad fornia residents for tuition purposes were repealed. A.B. 2619, which would have extended these sections, did not pass. Therefore all refugee students now must be classified as nonresidents for tuition purposes. Once a student has been granted permanent resident status by the Immigration & Naturalization Service and has official verification of the date the student was adjusted to perman\u00ad ent resident status (either a \"green card\" or some other offi\u00ad cial document) the student must present them to the Resi\u00ad dence Deputy so determination of whether or not the Uni\u00ad versity's requirements for resident classification are met. 8. Children of deceased public law enforcement or fire sup\u00ad pression employees, who were California residents and who were killed in the course of law enforcement or fire suppres\u00ad sion duties, may be entitled to resident status. Reclassification California law requires that students classified as nonresi\u00ad dents seeking reclassification as residents demonstrate that they are financially independent. This factor is in addition to the other requirements necessary for a resident classification. For detailed information refer to Reclassification of Nonresi\u00ad dents below. Note also that students must petition in person at the Registrar's Office for a change of classification from nonresident to resident status. All changes of status must be initiated prior to the late registration period for the term of attendance for which the student seeks reclassification. Reclassification of Nonresidents The California Education Code was amended effective July 1, 1981 to reflect consideration of financial independence as an additional factor for students seeking to reclassify from non\u00ad resident to resident for tuition purposes. To be reclassified as a resident under the new legislation, a student must meet the residency requirements stated above and must also demonstrate that he or she has been finan\u00ad cially independent according to the criteria specified in the new law. Students seeking reclassification should be prepared to fur\u00ad nish information verifying their financial independence for the calendar year in which reclassification is sought and in each of the three immediately preceding calendar years. Under the new law, a student is considered financially inde\u00ad pendent if during each of the four years he or she: 1. has not been claimed by nonresident parents as an exemp\u00ad tion for federal and state income tax purposes; 2. has not received more than $750 from the nonresident parents; and 3. has not lived in the nonresident parents' home for more than six weeks. Failure to satisfy all of the financial independence criteria for the entire period will not necessarily result in a denial of resi\u00ad dence status if the durational requirement of one year is met and the showing of intent is sufficiently strong. Financial independence is of greater significance for the current and immediately preceding calendar years. Failure to satisfy all three of the financial independence criteria for the current and immediately preceding calendar years normally will result in a determination of nonresidence. Financial independence, or want of it, for the second and third calendar years immediately preceding the year in which reclassification is requested will be considered together with all other relevant factors in determining intent, with no spe\u00ad cial weight attached to the financial independence factor. Time Limitation on Providing Documentation. If additional documentation is required for either an initial residence clas\u00ad sification or a reclassification but is not readily accessible, the student will be allowed a period of time no later than the end of the applicable term to provide such documentation. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Inquiries and Appeals The student is cautioned that this summation is not a com\u00ad plete explanation of the law regarding residence. The student should also note that changes may have been made in the rate of nonresident tuition and the residence requirements between the time this catalogue statement is published and the relevant residence determination date. Regulations have been adopted by The Regents, and a copy is available for inspection in the Registrar's Office. Waivers of Nonresident Tuition Nonresident Tuition waivers may be granted to spouses and dependent, unmarried children under age 21 of University faculty faculty members who are qualified for membership in the Academic Senate. Inquiries regarding these waivers should be directed to the Registrar's Office. To the extent funds are available, Nonresident Tuition waiv\u00ad ers may be granted to the unmarried, dependent children under age 21 of a full-time University employee whose per\u00ad manent assignment is outside California and who has been employed by the University for more than one year imme\u00ad diately prior to the opening of the term. Inquiries regarding these waivers normally should be directed to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. FEE REFUNDS New undergraduates who cancel their registration before the first day of instruction are entitled to a refund of Registra\u00ad tion Fee paid except for the $50 nonrefundable Acceptance of Admission Fee; other fees paid are refunded in full. For all continuing and readmitted students, and new graduate and medical students, there is a service charge of $10 for can\u00ad cellation of registration or withdrawal before the first day of instruction. \u00b7 The Associated Student Fee and the University Center Fee are refunded only for cancellation of registration prior to the first day of orientation. After instruction begins, a withdrawal form, available from the Registrar's Office, is necessary. Students who withdraw from the University during the first five weeks of instruction will receive refundsi of Registration Fee, Educational Fee, and Nonresident Tuition Fee, less the $50 nonrefundable Under\u00ad graduate Acceptance of Admission Fee, on the following basis, effective with the first day of instruction and the effec\u00ad tive date of withdrawal: 1-14 calendar days, 80% 15-21 60% of 22~28 40% of amount paid; 29-35 calendar days, 20% of amount paid; 36 calendar days and over, 0%. The effective date of withdrawal is normally the date the student's official notice of withdrawal is received by the University. However, under extenuating circumstances, the Assistant Vice Chancellor Student Affairs, the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, or the College of Medicine Promotion and Honors Committee, as appropriate, may determine that the effective date of withdrawal occurred prior to the filing of the notice. It is presumed that no University services will be provided to the student after that date. Claims for refund of fees must be presented during the fis\u00ad cal year (July 1 to June 30) in which the claim is applicable. To obtain a refund, the student must surrender the identifi\u00ad cation card to the Assistant Vice Chancellor Student Affairs, the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, or the College 1If no credit for courses is received, a full refund of the Registration Fee of the regular session will be granted to all students entering the armed forces prior to the sixth week of the quarter. No refund thereafter. Fees, Expenses, and Financial Aid 43 of Medicine Associate Dean for Medical Student Affairs at the time of withdrawal. Refund checks are issued by the Accounting Office and are generally received by mail about four weeks after the official withdrawal. If any portion of a student's fees has been paid by the Uni\u00ad versity or outside sources, that portion of the refund will be returned directly to the source of those funds. Students receiving financial aid will have their monies credited to the appropriate accounts. Housing Refund Policies UCI Housing Contracts provide students with complete housing refund policies. FINANCIAL AID Lack of funds need not be a barrier to attending UCI; almost one third of enrolled students receive some form of financial aid. Students who show that they need financial assistance in order to attend are eligible for financial aid through the Financial Aid Office. In addition to awarding aid on the basis of financial need, the Office also offers some scholarships based on academic excellence. Guaranteed Student Loans, at nine percent interest, are available through banks and other lenders regardless of financial need. Students who receive financial aid will receive funds from one or more of the following sources: scholarships, grants, loans, and Work-Study. These sources are described briefly in the following sections; more detailed information can be obtained from the Financial Aid Office. To obtain financial aid, new and continuing students must file the Student Aid Application for California (SAAC) and the necessary supporting documents each year. Students are encouraged to apply as early as possible. The SAAC, addi\u00ad tional forms, information regarding the application process, and financial aid programs for undergraduate, graduate, and medical students may be found in the Financial Aid Prospec\u00ad tus which is available in the Financial Aid Office. The usual priority deadline for loans, Work-Study, and most grants is around February 10. The application deadline for Cal Grants A and B is usually around February 10 for the following aca\u00ad demic year. The University expects the student and the par\u00ad ent (or spouse) to contribute toward the educational costs to every extent possible. For dependent students, an analysis of the SAAC and supporting documents determines the amount a student and the student's parents can be expected to con\u00ad tribute toward the cost of the student's education. For inde\u00ad pendent students, the analysis determines the amount a stu\u00ad dent and/or spouse can contribute to the cost of the student's education. Income, assets, debts, size of family, and the number of family members in college are the major factors considered in the analysis. Assets include, but are not limited to, equity in real estate; stocks, bonds, and other securities; business and farm equity; and cash, savings, and checking accounts. Income includes wages, salaries, interest, dividends, and nontaxable income such as Social Security and Veterans' benefits. All undergraduate financial aid applicants are also required to apply for a Pell Grant and for a Cal Grant A or a Cal Grant B. , Scholarships Scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic ability, achievement, and promise. Although a few honorary scholar\u00ad ships are awarded on the basis of academic excellence alone, most also require that an applicant demonstrate financial UC IRVINE - 1982-198344 Fees, Expenses, and Financial Aid need. To be considered for a scholarship, undergraduate stu\u00ad dents must file an Undergraduate Scholarship Application, available from the Financial Aid Office. Filing deadlines vary each year, but the usual deadline is early January for the fol\u00ad lowing academic year. Regents' scholarships, among the highest honors conferred upon UC students, are awarded on the basis of academic excellence and exceptional promise, without reference to financial need. Undergraduate students are eligible upon graduation from high school or upon completion of the sophomore year of college. Medical students are eligible dur\u00ad ing any year of their study in medical school. The appoint\u00ad ments range from four years for students entering from high school to two years for students appointed after their sophomore year. Regents' Scholars receive a $100 honora\u00ad rium for each year of their appointment. In addition, a sti\u00ad pend is awarded each year to Regents' Scholars who submit a complete financial aid application and demonstrate financial need. University scholarships are offered to students entering their freshman or junior year who show evidence of high scholas\u00ad tic attainment. Students who demonstrate financial need may receive stipends ranging up to $1,200 per academic year. These stipends are renewable by submitting an application for consideration each year. Other scholarships are available to students who meet special eligibility requirements. For additional information, ton tact the Scholarship Coordinator in the Financial Aid Office. For information on Air Force ROTC scholarships, see page 10. For additional information, contact the Scholarship Coor\u00ad dinator in the Financial Aid Office. Grants Grants are awarded on the basis of financial need. There is no repayment requirement. Peii Grant is the largest federally funded grant program and provides awards up to a maximum of $1,670 for the academic year. To be eligible, applicants must be U.S. citizens or eligible noncitizens and must be enrolled as undergraduates and have not previously received a bachelor's degree. Students may use the SAAC or the Application for Federal Student Aid to apply for this grant. Cal Grant A is a State-funded scholarship program and cur\u00ad rently provides awards up to $816 for the academic year to be applied to University fees. To be eligible, applicants must be California residents and demonstrate financial need. Stu\u00ad dents should use the SAAC together with the Cal Grant Supplement to apply for Cal Grant A. The filing deadline for new applicants is usually around February 10 for the follow\u00ad ing year. Cal Grant B is a State-funded grant program and provides awards up to a maximum of $1,100 during a student's first year and $1,100 plus the cost of fees during subsequent years. To be eligible, applicants must be California residents, demonstrate financial need, and be entering college or not have completed more than one quarter of college work. Stu\u00ad dents may use the SAAC together with the Cal Grant Sup\u00ad plement to apply for Cal Grant B. The filing deadline for new applicants is usually around February 10 for the following year. Note: Students may not receive both Cal Grant A and Cal Grant B. If offered both, the Financial Aid Office recommends lak\u00ad ing Cal Grant B over Cal Grant A. Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) pro\u00ad vides grant aid for U.S. citizens and eligible noncitizens who are undergraduate students and have demonstrated financial need. These federal grants range from $200 to $2,000 per year, depending upon financial need. UC Grant-In-Aid (GIA) is funded by the University of Cali\u00ad fornia and provides grant aid for full-time students who demonstrate financial need. The amount awarded depends upon financial need. Educational Fee Grant (EFG) is funded by the University of California and provides aid for undergraduates in their first three quarters of attendance at UCI. Recipients must be Cali\u00ad fornia residents, enrolled full time, and must demonstrate financial need. Loans National Direct Student Loan (NDSL) provides long-term federal loans for U.S. citizens and eligible noncitizens. The amounts awarded vary, depending on financial need, but can\u00ad not exceed $3,000 for the first two years or $6,000 for the undergraduate years. No interest is charged nor is repayment required while the borrower is enrolled in at least one half of the normal academic load. Interest of five percent a year be\u00ad gins six months after the borrower ceases to be enrolled or is enrolled less than half time, and repayment must be com\u00ad pleted within a 10-year period. Graduate students may receive an aggregate of $12,000 which includes loans received as an undergraduate. Educational Fee Loan (EFL), funded by the University of Cali\u00ad fornia, enables California residents who establish financial need to delay payment of all or a portion of the University of California's Educational Fee. Repayment at four percent interest begins nine months.after graduation or withdrawal from higher education. University Loan, funded by the University of California, pro\u00ad vides long-term loans to full-time students who demonstrate financial need. The maximum amount for an academic year is $1,000. The four percent interest begins when a student leaves UCI. Repayment begins six months after the student ceases to be enrolled full time and must be completed within five years. Two co-signers are required. California Guaranteed Student Loan Program (GSL) is a fed\u00ad erally and state-supported loan available to U.S. citizens and eligible noncitizens through participating local banks or other lenders at an interest rate of nine percent. Undergraduate students may borrow up to $2,500 per year depending on the participating bank. Undergraduates may borrow a maximum of $12,500. Graduate and medical students may borrow a maximum of $5,000 per year, not to exceed a cumulative total of $25,000, including undergraduate loans. The min\u00ad imum repayment is $50 per month and begins six months after the borrower ceases to be enrolled at least half time. The entire loan must be repaid in 15 years. Application forms are available at the UCI Financial Aid Office. Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) provides educa\u00ad tional loans to medical students. Applicants must be U.S. citi\u00ad zens or permanent residents who are enrolled in or have been accepted for enrollment to UCI. Applicants must be full\u00ad time students in good academic standing. A student may bor\u00ad row up to $20,000 per year. The cumulative maximum is $80,000. The interest rate is tied to 91-day Treasury bills plus 3.5 percent and begins at the time the student signs the promissory note. Repayment of the principal plus interest begins 10 months after completion of professional training, including internships and residencies, and must be completed within 10 years. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Fees, Expenses, and Financial Aid 45 UC IRVINE - 1982-198346 Fees, Expenses, and Financial Aid Health Professional Student Loan (HPFL) provides long-term federal loans to medical students. Applicants must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. The amount of the loan must not exceed the cost of fees plus $2,500 per academic year or the amount of the student's actual financial need, whichever is less. The interest rate is nine percent. Loan repayment begins after a student has completed professional training, including internships and residencies, and must be completed within 10 years. Emergency Loans are made from an emergency student loan fund made possible through various philanthropic individuals and organizations. These loans, which do not bear interest, are of a short-term nature to cover emergency needs. Work-Study Federal College Work-Study Program provides part-time employment for U.S. citizens and eligible noncitizens who are at least half-time students and demonstrate financial need. The maximum amount recipients can earn under this federal program is determined by their financial need. University Work-Study Program is similar to the Federal Col\u00ad lege Work-Study Program except that funds are allocated through The Regents of the University of California. Veterans Work-Study Program is available only to U.S. mil\u00ad itary veterans. Separate applications and detailed information are available from the UCI Veterans Student Services Office. Additional Aid for Graduate and Medical Students Most graduate fellowship programs are administered by the Divi\u00ad sion of Graduate Studies and Research. Graduate students should contact the Division Office, 145 Administration Build\u00ad ing, (714) 833-6761, for information about applicatiqn proce\u00ad dures for other forms of aid such as graduate fellowships or teaching and research assistantships. College of Medicine students should contact the Medical Student Financial Aid Coordinator, 125 Medical Surge I, College of Medicine, (714) 833-6476, for information about other sources of financial assistance. Aid for International Students Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible noncitizens may be eligible for assistance from a limited number of University programs if they have experienced an unanticipated change in their financial situation (which must be documented). These students must complete at least two years at UCI in order to be considered for assistance. Priority will be given to students who will be receiving their degrees during the cur\u00ad rent academic year. Financial aid is limited to the expenses for books and fees. Aid for Disabled Students All forms of student financial aid are available to eligible dis\u00ad abled students. Interested students should follow the regular financial aid application procedures and should be sure to specify on the Student Aid Application for California any additional expenses they may incur because of a disability. Supporting documentation must be provided. Student Employment The Career Planning and Placement Center assists UCI stu\u00ad dents and their spouses in obtaining part-or full-time employment during the academic year and summer vacation. It is not necessary to be a financial aid recipient to apply for jobs through the Center. Students with Work-Study awards may obtain on-campus or off-campus job referrals in the Career Planning and Placement Center. The Center is located in Student Services I. REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES ACADEMIC REGULATIONS Except where noted, all information applies to both under\u00ad graduate and graduate students. Additional information con\u00ad cerning academic regulations applying only to graduate stu\u00ad dents is given in the Graduate Studies and Research section. Grading System A -Excellent (4.0 grade points per unit) B -Good (3.0 grade points per unit) C -Average (2.0 grade points per unit) D -Lowest passing grade (1.0 grade point per unit) F -Not passing (no grade points) I -Incomplete P -Pass (equal to grade Cor better) NP-Not Pass S -Satisfactory (equal to grade B or better; graduate students only in courses so designated by the Graduate Council) U -Unsatisfactory (graduate students only in courses so designated by the Graduate Council) IP -In Progress (restricted to certain sequential courses, so designated by the Committee on Courses, for which the final quarter grade of a multiquarter sequence course is assigned to the previous quarter(s) of the sequence) NR-No Report (given when an instructor's final grade course report is not submitted or when the student's name was on the official class roster but the instructor did not report a grade for the student; NR becomes an For NP after one quarter of subsequent enrollment or at the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, which\u00ad ever comes first, unless the instructor at the student's request clears the record or replaces NR with a grade). W -Withdrew. A W notation is recorded on a student's permanent record for each course a student drops after the end of the sixth week of instruction in a quarter. Courses in which a W has been entered on a student's record will be dis\u00ad regarded in determining the student's grade point average and will not be considered as courses attempted in assessing the student's satisfaction of the normal progress requirement. Plus suffixes may be attached to the grades B, C. and D; minus suffixes may be attached to the grades A, B, C. and D. Plus grades carry three-tenths grade point more per unit, and minus grades carry three-tenths grade point less per unit than unsuffixed grades. After each quarter, a copy of the student's permanent record is available from the Registrar's Office. On the copy, the stu\u00ad dent will find grades for all the quarters taken at UCI, a com\u00ad putation of grade point average at the University of Califor\u00ad nia, and a list of the University requirements completed (Sub\u00ad ject A, American History and Institutions, etc.). Requirements for a bachelor's degree include the accumula\u00ad tion of credit for 180 quarter units with an average of at least C (grade point average of at least 2.0). A course at UCI nor\u00ad mally offers four quarter units of credit, and the term \"course\" may be understood in what follows to carry four units. The grade point average is the sum of all accumulated grade points (grade points earned in a course per unit limes the unit value of the course) divided by the sum of all units attempted. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983It should be noted that final grades as reported by professors at UCI are normally permanent and final. A professor may not change a final grade except to correct a clerical or pro\u00ad cedural error. Clerical or procedural errors should be cor\u00ad rected within one regular academic quarter after the grade is assigned. Under circumstances explained in the Academic Grievance Procedures (Manual of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate, Appendix II), a grade may be changed if the Academic Grievance Panel has determined that the grade was assigned on the basis of discrimination. Incomplete Grades An I or Incomplete grade is assigned by an instructor to a student when the student's work is of passing quality but is incomplete because of circumstances beyond the student's control, and when the student has been excused by the instructor from completing the quarter's work. For currently enrolled students, the maximum time limit for making up an I grade is three quarters of enrollment. After this time the I can no longer be replaced and will appear per\u00ad manently on the record. The student should consult the instructor to determine how the Incomplete may be made up. The instructor is not obligated to allow the maximum three-quarter period. It is strongly recommended that the student and the instructor prepare a written agreement specifying how the Incomplete can be made up and the deadline for doing so. A form is available for this purpose. Once the work is com\u00ad pleted within a time agreed upon by the instructor, the stu\u00ad dent should ask the instructor to submit a change of grade form to the office of the dean of the school in which the course was offered. The student should not reenroll in the course to make up the Incomplete. Students not currently enrolled at UCI have a maximum of one calendar year in which to replace an Incomplete. How\u00ad ever, in exceptional individual cases involving the student's prolonged inability to pursue a course of study, extensions of up to two additional years may be granted by the instructor with the approval of the dean of the unit offering the course; students must petition for such an extension within one calendar year following the assignment of the Incomplete grade. Courses graded I carry no grade points and are not included in computation of the grade point average which appears on the student's permanent record. Any I grade will remain indefinitely on the permanent record unless the work is com\u00ad pleted and a grade assigned as described above. University of California regulations require a grade point average of 2.0 for all units attempted in order to receive a bachelor's degree. Only when a check for satisfaction of gradua\u00ad tion requirements is made are l's treated as F's. If the student's overall average is at least a 2.0, including the Incomplete grades computed as F's, then the student may graduate. If the Incomplete grades computed as F's decrease the student's average below a 2.0, the student may not graduate until enough I grades have been made up to bring the average up to a 2.0 and this must be done within the time limits specified above. . Pass/Not Pass The Pass/Not Pass option is available at UCI to encourage students to enroll in courses outside their major field. Courses graded Pass or Not Pass are not included in compu\u00ad tation of the grade point average which appears on a stu\u00ad dent's permanent record. However, if a student receives a Pass in a class, course and unit credit for the class is received, except as provided below. If a Not Pass is received, the stu\u00ad dent receives no credit for the class. Academic Regulations 47 The use of Pass/Not Pass is governed by all of the following provisions: 1. A student in good standing may take up to an average of four units per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, candidates for the bachelor's degree may take a total of 12 more units in courses designated by academic units as Pass/ Not Pass Only. \u00b7 2. A student who earns a grade of C (2.0) or better will have a Pass/Not Pass grade recorded as Pass. If the student earns a grade of C-, D, or F, the grade will be recorded as a Not Pass, and no unit credit will be received for the course. In both cases, the student's grade will not be computed into the grade point average. 3. Courses taken under the Pass/Not Pass option may count toward the 180-unit requirement for the bachelor's degree and toward the breadth requirement. But with the exception of courses designated by the academic unit Pass/Not Pass Only, courses taken Pass/Not Pass may not be used to satisfy specific course requirements of the student's school and major department, unless authorized by the appropriate dean. Graduate students may take one course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program; may not be applied to the requirements for an advanced degree; and do not count toward the minimum number of units for which a graduate student must enroll. 4. Changes to or from the Pass/Not Pass option must be made during the enrollment period. No changes can be made after the first two weeks of a quarter without the approval of the dean of the student's school. 5. No student on academic probation may enroll in a course on the Pass/Not Pass option. (Physical Education courses are excepted.) Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Grades (Graduate Students Only) Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading, unlike Pass/Not Pass, is not a student option. With the consent of the academic units involved, individual study and research or other individual graduate work undertaken by a graduate student may be evaluated by means of the grades S or U. Certain graduate courses are graded S/U only. Also, the grade S or U may be assigned provisonally in each but the last quarter of a gradu\u00ad ate course extending over more than one quarter. Upon completion of the last quarter, letter grades (A to F) replace such provisional grades. When a grade of S or U has been assigned on a provisional basis and the student does not complete all quarters of the course sequence, the instructor may assign a final letter grade or the grade of I to replace the S or U, or let the grade of S or U stand as a final grade. With the specific approval of the Graduate Council, other graduate courses may be graded on an S/U basis provided that each student enrolled in such a course receives a grade of S, U, or I (or if an undergraduate student, a grade of P or NP). The grade Sis defined as equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No credit will be allowed for work graded Unsatisfactory. Grades In Progress IP is a transcript notation, restricted to sequential courses which extend over two or more quarters, indicating that the final grade for the individual quarters will not be assigned until the last quarter of the sequence is completed. The grade UC IRVINE - 1982-198348 Academic Regulations for the final quarter is then assigned for all of the previous quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. IP notations may be given only for courses designated by the Academic Senate Commit\u00ad tee on Courses for use of this notation. IP notations are not included in computations of the student's grade point average and do not contribute to the number of quarter units completed. Grades Not Reported A student who receives an NR must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. An NR becomes an For NP after one quarter of subse\u00ad quent enrollment or at the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, whichever comes first. NR transcript notations are not included in computations of the grade point average and do not contribute to the number of quarter units completed. Grade Points and Grade Point Average Grade points are assigned on a four point basis: A, 4 points per unit; 8, 3 points per unit; C, 2 points per unit; D, I point per unit; F and I, zero points. Plus or minus suffixes modify the above by plus or minus 0.3 grade point per unit. Each undergraduate course counts one through eight units, and graduate courses range from one to I2 units each (see departmental course descriptions). Grade point average (GPA) is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total value of courses attempted. P, NP, S, U, NR, IP, and I grades are excluded in computing grade point average. Removal of Deficient Grades Undergraduates may repeat courses only when grades of D, F, or NP were received. Degree credit for courses so repeated will be given only once, but the grade assigned at each en\u00ad rollment shall be permanently recorded. In computing the grade point average of an undergraduate with repeated courses in which a D, F, or NP was received, only the most recently received grades and grade points shall be used for the first I6 units repeated. In case of further repetitions, the grade point average shall be based on all grades assigned and on total units attempted. A graduate student may repeat only once a course in which a grade below 8 or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade shall be used in computing the stu\u00ad dent's grade point average for the first eight units of repeated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades will be used. Satisfaction of the Writing Requirement The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division Writing requirement must be completed with a grade of C-(1.7) or better. The following applies to students who fail to attain a grade of C-(1.7) or better in the lower-division courses: I. Students who fail to attain a grade of C-(1.7) in one or both courses of the Writing 39A-8 sequence must repeat the course or courses in question. 2. Students who fail to attain a C-(I. 7) in Humanities I5 normally should enroll in Writing 39A; students who fail to attain a C-in Humanities I6 should normally enroll in Writ\u00ad ing 398. Alternatively, a student who fails to attain a C-in either Humanities I5 or I6 may repeat these courses with the permission of a faculty advisor or academic counselor. 3. Students who fail to attain a C-(I.7) in at least two quar\u00ad ters of the writing component of the Humanities Core Course normally should substitute Writing 398 if they need one quarter of additional work to complete the requirement, or Writing 39A-8 if they need two quarters to complete the requirement. The course taken to fulfill the upper-division requirement must be completed with a grade of C (2.0) or better. The fol\u00ad lowing applies to students who fail to attain a grade of C (2.0) or better in the upper-division course: Students who fail to attain a grade of C (2.0) in Writing I39 should repeat Writing I39. Students following any other approved upper-division option should enroll in Writing 139 if a Cis not attained in the selected course. See page I3 for further information on the Writing require\u00ad ment portion of the breadth requirement. CREDIT BY EXAMINATION An enrolled student may obtain credit for many courses by taking a special examination administered by a faculty member who normally teaches that course. Detailed proce\u00ad dures for obtaining credit by examination may be obtained from the office of the dean of the school which offers the course. Approval of any petition for credit by examination must be obtained from the dean of that school before the examination can be administered. After the dean has signed the petition, the student must have it validated by paying a $5 Credit by Examination Fee at the Cashier's Office. The instructor giving the examination retains the prerogative (I) to decide whether the course can be taken by examina\u00ad tion, (2) to determine the form such an examination may take, and (3) to stipulate whether the grade will be reported as Pass/Not Pass or as A, 8, C, D, or F. A student may take the examination for a particular course only one time. After receiving the grade, the student may accept it or reject it. If the student is not satisfied with the grade received on the examination, the student may choose not to receive credit or a grade. If the student does choose to accept the results of the examination, grades and grade points will be entered on the record in the same manner as those for regular courses of instruction. INDEPENDENT STUDY: UNDERGRADUATES ONLY Another class option is available primarily to upper-division stu\u00ad dents at UCI. The independent-study option allows the stu\u00ad dent to plan with the instructor a course having a clear rela\u00ad tionship to the student's academic program. The plan for the course will include a reading list, a group of assignments, examinations, papers, or similar evidence of intellectual achievement on which academic credit will be based. A de\u00ad scription of the course and of its requirements must be approved by the instructor responsible for it and by the department chair or dean. Independent-study credit for undergraduates is normally limited to five units per quarter. FINAL EXAMINATIONS Final examinations are obligatory in all undergraduate courses except laboratory and studio courses, or their equiv\u00ad alent, as individually determined by the Committee on Courses. Normally each such examination shall be conducted in writing and must be completed by all participants by the announced time shown in the Schedule of Classes for the quarter in question. These examinations may not exceed three hours duration. In laboratory and studio courses, the department concerned may at its option require a final exam\u00ad ination subject to prior announcement in the Schedule of Classes for the term. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Final grade reports from professors are due in the Registrar's Office within 72 hours after the final examination. UNDERGRADUATE SCHOLARSHIP REQUIREMENTS Class Level Undergraduate students are classified as freshman, sopho\u00ad more, junior, or senior students, based on the total number of units acquired, as follows: Freshman 0 -40.4 Sophomore 40.5 -83.9 Junior 84.0 -134.9 Senior 135.0 -180.0 Course Load Limits An undergraduate may enroll in as few as 12 units or as many as 20 units. To enroll for more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units a student must obtain the signature of the stu\u00ad dent's dean on the Enrollment in Classes Petition. Any action to add or drop courses after submission of the Enrollment in Classes Petition which will cause a student to be enrolled in more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units requires approval by the student's dean. This approval is certified by the dean's signature on the Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Card, as appropriate. Academic Standing To remain in good academic standing a student must main\u00ad tain a grade point average of at least 2.0 and make progress toward the degree at a satisfactory rate. An undergraduate student normally is subject to academic probation if at the end of any quarter the grade point average for that quarter, or the cumulative grade point average, is less than 2.0. A student whose grade point average falls below a 1.5 for any quarter, or who after two consecutive quarters on proba\u00ad tion has not achieved a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or a satisfactory rate of progress, is subject to disqualification. Normal Progress Requirement Regular undergraduate students will become subject to pro\u00ad bation or subject to disqualification from further registration in the University if they fail to make normal progress toward the baccalaureate degree. (A) Normal progress for all regular undergraduate students is defined in the following table, in terms of quarter units completed at the end of quarters enrolled. Quarter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Normal Subject to Progress to Disqualification 7 15 23 39 55 71 88 105 123 141 159 (B) A student who at the end of a given quarter of enroll- ment has completed no less than a number of units in the range specified in the \"Normal Progress\" category under (A) Academic Regulations 49 is making normal progress. A student who at the end of a given quarter of enrollment has completed a number of units in the range specified in the \"Subject to Probation\" category under (A) is subject to being placed on probation by the faculty of that student's school or program or its designated agent. A student who at the end of a given quarter of en\u00ad rollment has completed no more than a number of units in the range specified in the \"Subject to Disqualification\" cate\u00ad gory under (A) is subject to disqualification by the faculty of that student's school or program or its designated agent. (C) Students who have completed two consecutive quarters on academic probation without having achieved at the end of that period at least the normal rate of progress specified under (A) are subject to disqualification. A student will be allowed to continue on probation only if the record indicates likely achievement of the required scholastic standing within a reasonable time. (D) For purposes of calculating \"Normal Progress,\" \"Subject to Probation,\" and \"Subject to Disqualification,\" students admitted to the University with advanced standing will be classified with respect to quarter of enrollment at entrance in accordance with the following table: Quarter at Advanced Standing Quarter Entrance Units at Entrance 1 0-14 2 15-29 3 30-44 4 45-59 8 105-119 9 120-134 10 135-149 (E) Units earned under the following three circumstances are not to be counted toward determination of the quarter at entrance under (D) above: (1) Advanced Placement Examina\u00ad tion; (2) College Level Examination Program; (3) concurrent enrollment in college courses while in high school. (F) The quarter of enrollment at entrance of students (in\u00ad cluding baccalaureate degree candidates who already hold a baccalaureate degree) seeking admission to the University with 150 or more advanced standing units will be determined by th!! faculty offering the curriculum in which such stu\u00ad dents seek to enroll. This determination will be made con\u00ad sistent with the program required for such students to obtain the desired degree and with University residence requirements. Probation is not a necessary step before disqualification. If a student becomes subject to disqualification, the complete record of grades and other accomplishments will be carefully reviewed by the responsible faculty authorities of the stu\u00ad dent's school. If the record indicates little probability that the UC IRVINE - 1982-198350 Enrollment and Other Procedures student will be able to meet the academic standards of the University of California, the student will be disqualified from further enrollment. Each school and program is obliged by Academic Senate regulations to maintain a procedure under which a student may appeal probation and disqualification actions. In order to transfer from one campus to another in the Uni\u00ad versity of California or from one UCI school to another, a student who has been disqualified or who is on academic probation must obtain the approval of the appropriate faculty, or its designated agent, into whose jurisdiction the student seeks to transfer. GRADUATE SCHOLARSHIP REQUIREMENTS For a graduate student, only the grades A, A-, B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship. Information concerning graduate student course load requirements and satisfactory academic progress is given in the Graduate Studies and Research section. ENROLLMENT IN UNIVERSITY EXTENSION If a UCI student wishes to enroll in a University Extension course concurrently with enrollment in regular courses, the entire program of study must be approved in advance by the dean of the student's school (in the case of graduate students, by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research). CREDITS FROM OTHER INSTITUTIONS: UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS UCI undergraduate students who wish to enroll in courses at another institution in either a summer or regular session and to use such courses to satisfy any UCI requirements must secure approval from the Office of Admissions and their aca\u00ad demic dean. If such courses are determined by the Office of Admissions to be transferable, and if such courses do not duplicate other credit granted and do not exceed limitations of credit, then the units earned may be applied toward the total required for graduation. The student's academic dean will determine the applicability of such transfer credit toward the satisfaction of specific program requirements. Students are urged to secure, in advance of enrolling in courses, authorization from the Office of Admissions and their academic deans to apply such courses toward UCI requirements. Only then will the applicability of such courses be guaranteed. Forms for securing such authorization are available in the Office of Admissions and in deans' offices. Such advance authorization is not required; however, stu\u00ad dents may seek it for their own assurance. CREDITS FROM OTHER INSTITUTIONS OR UNIVERSITY EXTENSION: GRADUATE STUDENTS Graduate students may be granted unit credit (not grade credit) toward a master's degree for acceptable graduate-level courses completed at another institution or through Univer\u00ad sity Extension prior to first enrollment in graduate study at UCI. After enrollment, the student must initiate a formal petition for such credit: Approval of the student's Graduate Advisor and the Graduate Dean is required. While enrolled at UCI or on a Leave of Absence a graduate student may receive unit credit for graduate-level courses completed at another institution or through University Extension only with the prior approval of the student's Graduate Advisor and the Graduate Dean. See the Graduate Studies and Research section for further information about graduate transfer credit and the Univer\u00ad sity's Intercampus Exchange Program. ENROLLMENT AND OTHER PROCEDURES Except where noted, all information applies to both under\u00ad graduate and graduate students. Additional information con\u00ad cerning enrollment and academic policies applying only to graduate students is given in the Graduate Studies and Research section. ENROLLMENT AND PAYMENT OF FEES To receive academic credit for regular courses and other supervised instruction or research, a student must be offi\u00ad cially enrolled prior to undertaking such activities. Enroll\u00ad ment does not become official until all required fees have been paid, and the student's Enrollment in Classes Petition has been completed correctly, signed where necessary, and submitted to the Registrar. Students are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollments as indicated on the Class Verification and Identification Card are correct. The Schedule of Classes is provided by the Registrar's Office with registration materials approximately six weeks before the beginning of each quarter. The most important form in the registration materials is the Enrollment in Classes Peti\u00ad tion. It should be filled out carefully, according to the instruc\u00ad tions provided on the form and in the Schedule of Classes. A quarterly calendar of dates for submission of enrollment materials and payment of fees is included in each quarterly Schedule of Classes. The general procedures for enrollment are: 1. Consult the appropriate academic advisor to develop an approved program of study. Secure necessary signatures on the Enrollment in Classes Petition for courses that require special approval. New undergraduate students entering in the fall should seriously consider attending one of the Student-Parent Orientation Program (SPOP) sessions during the summer for academic advising and enrollment assistance. 2. Submit the completed class enrollment and student infor\u00ad mation forms to the Registrar. 3. Pay required fees to the Cashier. Any other outstanding obligations must be satisfied at this time also. Class Verification and Identification Card After payment of fees and submission of enrollment mate\u00ad rials, a Class Verification and Identification Card is available for each student. The Card lists the courses in which a stu\u00ad dent is enrolled. If any courses requested could not be sched\u00ad uled, they are listed also, with the reason why the student is not enrolled in the course. Changes to course enrollments after receipt of the Card are handled through Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Cards, available from the stu\u00ad dent's academic dean's office or the Registrar. New undergraduate students are required to call in person at their academic deans' offices to secure their Class Verification and Identification Cards and advice concerning their academic programs. Continuing undergraduate students and graduate students should consult the quarterly Schedule of Classes for instruc\u00ad tions on where to secure their cards. The Class Verification and Identification Card is certification of the student's class enrollment and is evidence that the stu\u00ad dent is registered at UCI and is entitled to Library privileges. In addition, the Card provides identification for Associated Students functions. If the Card is lost, there is a $3 replace- UC IRVINE - 1982-1983ment charge. Inquiries regarding the replacement of lost cards should be directed to the office that issued the Card. Late Enrollment and Payment of Fees Students who submit enrollment materials and pay fees within the published periods are not subject to late service fees. Those who do not submit an Enrollment in Classes Peti\u00ad tion to the Registrar's Office during the published period are subject to a late service fee of $50. Students who do not pay all required fees to the Cashier's Office during the published period for payment of fees are subject to a late service fee of $50. If fees are not paid by the established deadline prior to the beginning of instruction, the student is subject to both late service fees (total $100) if allowed to enroll and pay fees after the deadline. To avoid the expense and inconvenience of late enrollment, students are urged to enroll and pay fees well before the pub\u00ad lished deadlines. Students with financial need should make advance arrangements with the Financial Aid Office, or another source, to have funds available when fees are due. The Registrar does not have authority to allow a student to pay fees after the deadline date or to waive the late fees, except in unusual cases where the University is responsible for the late transaction. A student who is allowed to apply late and, as a result, must pay fees and enroll late, is required to pay late service fees. Change of Class Enrollment After official enrollment materials have been filed with the Registrar, a student may add or drop courses, change sections of a course, or change the grading option by completing an Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Card, available from the student's academic dean's office. An undergraduate student may not enroll in more than 20 units (excluding Physical Education) nor fewer than 12 units of course work during a given quarter without the permis\u00ad sion of the student's academic dean. Changes to Pass/Not Pass grading must not cause the student to exceed the limita\u00ad tions to Pass/Not Pass enrollment. Graduate students may not enroll in more than 16 or fewer than eight units of graduate or upper-division credit without prior approval of the departmental Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. During the first six weeks of each quarter, a student may add classes provided approval to add each class is granted by the instructor in charge. To add a class, a student must obtain the instructor's signature of approval on an Add card, carefully complete the Add card, and submit the card to the student's academic dean's office or the Registrar's Office no later than the end of the sixth week of instruction. To drop a class or change the grading option during the first two weeks of the quarter, a student must obtain the signa\u00ad ture of the instructor in charge as evidence of notification on a Drop or Change of Grading Option Card and submit the card to the student's academic dean no later than the end of the second week of instruction. Students may drop classes from the third through the sixth week of a quarter, inclusive, only with the permission of the instructor in charge. A student wishing to drop a class during this period must obtain the signature of approval from the instructor in charge on a Drop card and submit the card to the student's academic dean. After the sixth week of a quarter, students may drop a course only with the permission of the instructor and the student's academic dean. Permission to drop after the sixth week can be granted only if the student is not failing the Enrollment and Other Procedures 51 course and not subject to disqualification, and only if drop\u00ad ping the course would be to the educational benefit of the student and/or of the class as a whole. To drop a class after the sixth week, a student must complete a Drop card, obtain the instructor's signature of approval, and submit the card to the student's academic dean for the dean's action. Graduate students must have the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research to drop a course after the sixth week. A W notation will be recorded for each course dropped after the end of the sixth week of classes. The effective date of a \"drop\" is the date the approved Drop card is received in the Registrar's Office. Every student enrolled in a laboratory course in which equipment is issued is responsible for the equipment when dropping a course and will not be permitted to drop until the equipment is accounted for. Students are responsible for their official enrollment and must be officially enrolled in each class for which they expect credit. They must officially drop classes they have ceased attending. The student cannot simply discontinue attendance in a class; a Drop card must be filed or the student will receive an F grade in the class. Courses may not be added or dropped retroactively. Students are urged to verify their offi\u00ad cial enrollment during the eighth week of the quarter. Stu\u00ad dents enrolling for the next quarter will find this information included with enrollment materials for the next quarter. Those students not enrolling for the next quarter can verify their official enrollment by inquiring at the Registrar's Office. There is a $3 service charge for all add, drop, or change tran\u00ad sactions received in the Registrar's Office after the second week of classes. LAPSE OF STATUS A student's status may lapse for the following reasons: Failure to pay required student fees by the prescribed dead\u00ad line; failure to respond to official notices; failure to settle financial obligations when due or to make satisfactory arrangements with the Cashier's Office; failure to complete the physical examination; or failure to comply with admission conditions. Each student who becomes subject to lapse of status action is given advance notice and ample time to deal with the situa\u00ad tion. However, if the student fails to respond, action will be taken without further notice, and the student will be dropped from all courses and will be entitled to no further services of the University except assistance toward reinstatement. A student who desires to be reinstated must satisfy the condi\u00ad tions which caused the lapse of status and pay a $10 rein\u00ad statement fee at the Cashier's Office. The student should then make arrangements to have all of the courses dropped reinstated on his or her academic record by following the procedures outlined in the Notice of Lapse of Status letter mailed to the student prior to dropping of the courses. TRANSCRIPT OF RECORDS The transcript of a student's academic records will be released only upon receipt of a signed request of the student authorizing the release. Application may be made in person or by mail; telephoned requests cannot be honored because payment is due in advance. Application for a transcript should be submitted to the Cashier's Office with a check or UC IRVINE - 1982-198352 Enrollment and Other Procedures money order payable to Regents-UC for the exact amount due. The fee for transcripts is $3 for the first fOpy and $1 for each additional copy ordered at the same time. All outstanding debts to the University (with the exception of long-term financial aid loans not yet due and payable) must be paid in full before a transcript will be released. Requests for transcripts by other than the student whose transcript is being sought can be honored only (I) if the request is accompanied by a written authorization signed by the student whose transcript is sought, and (2) upon approval of the Registrar. Such transcripts can be released by the Registrar only to another college, university, or educationally related agencies such as the Law School Data Admissions Service (LSDAS) or the American Medical College Applica\u00ad tion Service (AMCAS). Such transcripts cannot be released to the person making the request in the student's stead. When a student orders a transcript sent to another college, university, or agency, it is extremely important for the stu\u00ad dent to provide a complete, accurate mailing address to ensure delivery to the correct office. At least two weeks should be allowed for a transcript to be received by another institution or agency. DIPLOMAS Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are avail\u00ad able, which is about 90 days after the quarter in which the degrees are awarded. Students may then call in person at the Registrar's Office or authorize the Registrar to deliver their diplomas by certified mail, or registered air mail to locations outside the United States. There is a service charge of $2 for certified mail, $3 for registered air mail, payable to Regents\u00ad UC. All outstanding debts due to the University, with the exception of long-term financial aid loans, must be paid in full before a student's diploma will be released. CANCELLATION PRIOR TO START OF INSTRUCTION A student who pays fees for a regular academic quarter and then decides to leave the University prior to the first day of classes must submit a Notice of Cancellation, with the identi\u00ad fication card attached, to the appropriate dean's office. With the exception of new undergraduate students, there is a $10 service charge for cancellation prior to the first day of classes. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE UNIVERSITY AFTER THE START OF INSmUCTION After classes begin for a regular academic quarter, an enrolled student who decides to leave the University before the end of that quarter must submit an official Notice of Withdrawal. A student who fails to submit a Notice of With\u00ad drawal will receive failing grades in all courses and severely jeopardize his or her academic standing at the University. Undergraduate students must submit the notice, with the identification card attached, to the Assistant Vice Chancellor Student Affairs. Graduate students must submit the notice to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, and students in the College of Medicine must submit it to the College of Medicine Director of Admissions and Records. In extenuating circumstances, such as illness or emergency, the student should notify the appropriate dean or office as soon as possible in order to initiate withdrawal procedures. The effective date of the withdrawal will be determined by the appropriate dean. A W notation will be recorded for each course in which en\u00ad rollment is withdrawn if the student's effective date of with\u00ad drawal is after the end of the sixth week of classes. A graduate student in good academic standing who wishes to withdraw and intends to return within one year may submit both the Notice of Withdrawal and an application for a Leave of Absence. If the leave is approved, the student remains in good standing and need not apply for readmission in order to enroll at the expiration of the leave period. Further informa\u00ad tion about leaves of absence appears in the Graduate Studies and Research section. If a student plans to leave the University after completing all academic work for the latest quarter of enrollment and has not paid fees for the next quarter, a formal Notice of With\u00ad drawal is not necessary. See page 43.for information on fee refunds. READMISSION: UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS Students are strongly urged to consider the policy below in formulating plans for leaving or returning to UCI. Every effort will be made to readmit UCI students who were in good academic standing at the time of dropping out and who have filed readmission applications. Readmission is not automatic. A student must file an Applica\u00ad tion for Readmission with the Registrar's Office at least eight weeks prior to the quarter in which readmission is desired and pay a nonrefundable $25 Application Fee at the Cashier's Office. If a student has been academically disqualified from the Uni\u00ad versity or has left the University while on probation or sub\u00ad ject to disqualification, the student must apply for readmis\u00ad sion in the manner prescribed above. The application, how\u00ad ever, will be forwarded to the dean of the school which the student hopes to enter. If the dean decides that the student is serious about academic life, and/or that the student has dis\u00ad played capability at another academic institution, the student will most likely be allowed readmission to the University. Transcripts for work taken at other institutions must be sub\u00ad mitted as part of the application. A nonrefundable fee of $25 is charged for each Application for Readmission. Remittance by bank draft or money order payable to Regents-UC must be attached to the application. READMISSION: GRADUATE STUDENTS A graduate student who withdraws and has not been granted a leave of absence approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research can resume graduate study only if readmitted. The Application for Readmission must be submitted by the published deadline for graduate admission applications. Please refer to the statement on readmission which appears in the Graduate Studies and Research section. INTERCAMPUS TRANSFER: UNDERGRADUATES ONLY An undergraduate student in good standing may transfer from the UCI campus to another campus of the University of California. To do so, the student should first check with the UCI Registrar to see which of the campuses are accepting transfers and which majors are being encouraged by each campus. The student then obtains an Intercampus Transfer Application form from the UCI Registrar's Office and files the form with the UCI Registrar by the deadline prescribed for the quarter in which the student wishes to transfer. The filing periods are: winter quarter-July 1-31; spring quarter\u00ad October 1-31; fall quarter-November 1-30. After these dates, applications are accepted only until quotas are filled. A student may apply for only one campus in any given quarter. A nonrefundable fee of $25 is required for all Intercampus Transfer Applications filed with the Registrar's Office. UC II ~ I I r ... \u00b7~ All inquiries with regard to the requirements for the estab\u00ad lishment of California residence (including exceptions per\u00ad taining to minors, certain classes of refugees and permanent residents of the United States, and dependents of military personnel stationed in California) should be directed to the Residence Deputy, Registrar's Office, 215 Administration Building, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717, (714) 833-6124 or the Office of the Legal Analyst\u00ad Residence Matters, 590 University Hall, University of Cali\u00ad fornia, 2200 University Avenue, Berkeley, California 94720, (415) 642-2822. Please refer to the Fees section for informa\u00ad tion on the Nonresident Tuition Fee and California residence. Enrollment and Other Procedures 53 \\ \\I j 1 UC IRVINE - 1982-1983STUDENT AFFAIRS The Office of the Vice Chancellor Student Affairs provides students with a broad range of special services and programs designed to carry out the University of California's commit\u00ad ment to create an environment supportive of an educational endeavor of the highest quality. OFFICE OF RELATIONS WITH SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES The Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges (ORSC) serves as a liaison between the University of California, Irvine and other educational institutions of the State. Staff members visit secondary schools and community colleges to interpret the policies and programs of the University and to seek information for the University about educational devel\u00ad opments throughout the State. In cooperation with commu\u00ad nity colleges, ORSC staff mediates course articulation agreements and provides assistance with the transfer pro\u00ad cess. The ORSC staff is a resource to schools and to education-oriented groups, and responds to invitations requesting University representatives and participation in col\u00ad lege advisement programs at schools and in the community. Staff members also provide information for prospective stu\u00ad dents, teachers, parents, and counselors. On the UC Irvine campus, the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges provides a number of services for the prospective student. Program information is supplied in a variety of forms: brochures, flyers, films, and slide presenta\u00ad tions are available, describing programs of study offered at UCI and explaining how students can qualify for admission. ORSC also schedules campus visits and tours, arranges edu\u00ad cational conferences, sponsors a variety of on-campus activi\u00ad ties for prospective students and educational groups, and assists prospective students in the application process. ORSC participates in the Access and Aspiration Model (AAM) Pro\u00ad gram for community college women, and sponsors a program of honors outreach to the high schools and community col\u00ad leges. Student-led tours for prospective students and their parents and school groups may be scheduled through the Office by calling Campus Tours, (714) 833-5832. EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM/ STUDENT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION Educational Opportunity Program The Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) for disadvan\u00ad taged students may provide, according to the student's cir\u00ad cumstances, special admissions consideration, assistance with financial aid application and procedures, and referral to advis\u00ad ing, tutoring, and learning skills services. The goal of EOP is to encourage representation of disadvan\u00ad taged students at UCI by assisting them in enrolling and suc\u00ad ceeding at the University. The kinds of difficulties students encounter in seeking a college education may range from inadequate preparation to a lack of funds to support their education. The Educational Opportunity Program is designed to assist students in overcoming obstacles by providing coun\u00ad seling on admissions and financial aid, and referral to advis\u00ad ing, tutoring, and learning skills services. A special EOP summer session is offered to those students identified by EOP as most likely to benefit from this support program. Special assistance on a continuing basis is available to all EOP students through the Counseling Center, the Tutorial Assistance Program, Learning Skills Services, and the Special Services Office. Information and the EOP brochure may be obtained from the EOP Office, (714) 833-5410. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds are encouraged to apply. EOP assists those who are regularly admissible to the University, and also those who may not have met traditional admissions requirements but who can offer evidence support\u00ad ing their ability to achieve at the University level. With the exception of American Indians, only residents of the State of California are eligible to apply for EOP sponsorship. Ameri\u00ad can Indian applicants must document their tribal affiliation. Admission Prospective EOP students must complete the regular UC admission forms and follow all procedures. EOP applicants should take particular care with the required essay and indi\u00ad cate their interest in EOP by marking the appropriate places provided on the application. Applications may be obtained from counseling offices in California high schools and com\u00ad munity colleges or the UCI Office of Admissions. EOP appli\u00ad cants who require special admissions consideration are advised to submit two letters of recommendation from teachers, counselors, persons in the community, or employ\u00ad ers, which document the student's background, motivation, and academic potential. In those cases where entering the University at this time would not seem appropriate, the EOP staff may recommend a program of study in a community college or elsewhere, in order that the student may qualify for UCI at a later date. Financial Assistance Personal financial resources should not be the determining factor in deciding whether or not to attend college. All stu\u00ad dents admitted to UCI, including EOP students, are eligible for financial assistance on the basis of demonstrated need. Funds can be provided to cover room and board, fees, books and supplies, and living expenses, when a student or family is unable to fully meet these expenses. Financial aid is com\u00ad prised of a combination or \"package\" of grant, loan, scholar\u00ad ship, and/or part-time employment based on the individual circumstances of the applicant. See Financial Aid, page 43. Undergraduate Student Affirmative Action Outreach Program The purpose of the Student Affirmative Action Outreach Program is to attract underrepresented minority and disad\u00ad vantaged students who are regularly admissible to UCI. Campus representatives visit high schools, community col\u00ad leges, and community centers to meet with students, parents, teachers, and school officials to discuss educational opportun\u00ad ities at UCI. The program also includes a series of seminars and workshops aimed at orienting students to specific aca\u00ad demic disciplines, particularly mathematics, physics, computer science, chemistry, biology, and engineering where minorities historically have been underrepresented. DEVELOPMENTAL OUTREACH PROGRAMS AND GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS This Office directs the Partnership Programs for junior and senior high school students, the Academic Enrichment Pro\u00ad gram, and the Student Teacher Education Project (STEP). These programs are designed to prepare junior and senior high school students for postsecondary education.

A limited number of single rooms also are available in each residence hall. Every room has carpeting and draperies, and is fur\u00ad nished with a bed, desk, chair, chest of drawers, closet, and bookshelves for each student. Both Mesa Court and Middle Earth have complete food service and dining commons for their residents. The halls are, however, closed during the Christmas and spring recesses. Each hall tends to have distinctive characteristics and often focuses on a specific interest or life-style. Examples include halls devoted to the fine arts, the humanities, languages, the outdoors, or crafts. Students who live in the residence halls participate in a prepaid meal plan. Meals are served cafeteria\u00ad style, and the menu offers a wide selection of food, with fresh fruit and an array of salads daily.

Undergraduate applicants must indicate their interest in on\u00ad campus housing by marking the appropriate item on the UC Undergraduate Application for Admission in order to receive an application for housing. Prompt return of the Housing Application is important as housing priority is given based on the date of receipt of the completed housing application. Due to the large demand for housing, students wishing to live on campus should apply for admission on November 1, when the application filing period opens, if they wish to live on campus the following fall. Continuing UCI undergraduates are required to participate in a lottery each spring in order to compete for space in the residence halls or undergraduate apartments for the following academic year. The application for admission allows the students to request information about off-campus housing as well. Students who become eligible for residence hall contracts will be obliged to pay approximately $100 as a reservation fee at the time the contract is returned to the University; any can\u00ad cellation, regardless of the circumstances or time of year, will result in a nonrefundable penalty fee. The cost of room and board in the residence halls is paid in quarterly payments. Students who live off campus may wish to take advantage of the Nonresident Meal Contract. This contract, good for any quarter, enables a student to eat 19 meals per week in Mesa Commons. For spring quarter, 1982, the price of the meal plan was $5 per day. Residential Learning The Student Programs Offices at Mesa Court and Middle Earth have the significant responsibility of providing student residents with an environment conducive to their intellectual, social, and personal growth.

Yahr, Ph.D. University of Texas, Associate Professor of Psychobiology No one can predict the future, but this much is known: the next quarter century is the time of the biologist, who will be in the midst of many of the activities that govern major aspects of life. These include some of the most challenging intellectual problems, such as the mechanisms of memory and of learning, the molecular basis of embryonic develop\u00ad ment, and the rules that help predict the behavior of the environment. Biology also lies at the heart of major social problems that face mankind in the coming decade, such as sensible management of the environment and the effective control of human populations. It is vital that educated men and women understand the contributions that biological sci\u00ad ences have made and will continue to make for the future welfare of mankind. The School of Biological Sciences reflects new concepts of biology in both its curriculum and its research programs. The faculty is dedicated to providing students with the opportun\u00ad ity to avail themselves of the principles and ever-increasing knowledge of biology. The curriculm is designed to meet present and future educational needs of majors and non\u00ad majors. In keeping with the responsibilities of the University, the School encourages vigorous faculty and student research programs. It strongly believes that excellence in research is essential for effective, enthusiastic, and up-to-date teaching. Each quarter nearly 300 undergraduate students and ISO graduate and postdoctoral students participate in independ\u00ad ent research programs. In addition to the regular University requirements for admis\u00ad sion, students interested in the biological sciences should include in their high school curriculum, in addition to a course in biology, four years of mathematics, as well as courses in chemistry and physics, which are now an integral part of most contemporary biological work. The biological sciences are presented as an integrated area of study through the eight-quarter Biological Sciences Core, with lectures and laboratories developing the major concepts of modern biology. Satellite courses expand upon and inten\u00ad sify areas covered in the Core and provide students with the opportunity to specialize in a particular area of the biological sciences. In addition to the regular major in Biological Sci\u00ad ences, a concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology, also leading to a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences, is available at the undergraduate level. The degree requirements of these two programs are similar, with the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology placing a greater emphasis on ecology and the natural sciences and a lesser emphasis on chemistry and molecular biology. Introductory courses for nonmajors are designed to make the biological sciences mean\u00ad ingful and interesting and to inform intelligent citizens of bio\u00ad logical phenomena that affect their daily lives. Graduate courses are offered in all the departments. Students with an interest in the application of ecology to human needs may choose the Applied Ecology major, leading to a B.A. degree in Applied Ecology, which is offered jointly by the School of Biological Sciences and the Program in Social Ecology. See page 197. DEGREES Biological Sciences ............... B.S., M.A.T., M.S., Ph.D. A concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology is available at the undergraduate level. Opportunities are avail\u00ad able at the graduate level to specialize in Developmental and Cell Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Psychobiology, Anatomy, Microbi\u00ad ology, and Physiology and Biophysics. Applied Ecology (offered jointly with the Program in Social Ecology) ....................... B.A. Honors Graduation with Honors.

DEGREE IN BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES University Requirements: See page 12. School Requirements Biological Sciences Core Curriculum (90, 101, 102, 103, 103L, 104, 104L, 105, IOSL, 106, 106L, 107); or SA-B-C, SLA-LB-LC; and Humanities 1A-B-C, or another option of the lower\u00ad division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) and a three-quarter sequence in either Humani\u00ad ties or Literature (Category IV, Humanistic Inquiry). Biological Sciences 65 Students must have a 2.0 cumulative grade point average in the Biological Sciences Core Curriculum and three satellite courses. In addition to the listed Biological Sciences satellite courses, Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C and Physics 18A-B-C can be used to satisfy the satellite requirement. Students with a double major in Psychology and Biological Sciences can also use Psychology ISIA-B-C to satisfy the satellite requirement. No student may enter as a double major, but students inter\u00ad ested in other areas may possibly become double majors after the first quarter, if the second school or program approves. A strong academic performance in the second area is requisite for acceptance as a double major. For information on requirements for the B.S. degree in Bio\u00ad logical Sciences with a concentration in Ecology and Environ\u00ad mental Biology, see page 68. UCI Breadth Requirement Those students majoring in Biological Sciences who have completed the School requirements and who have passed any two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core or its alternative with a grade of C-(1. 7) or better will have satisfied the UCI breadth requirement, with two excep\u00ad tions: the upper-division writing requirement and Category III, Social and Behavioral Sciences. Specifically, the Humanities Core or its alternative satisfies Category IV, Humanistic Inquiry; it also satisfies the lower\u00ad division writing requirement when two quarters of the writ\u00ad ing component are passed with a grade of C-or better. Chemistry and physics satisfy Category II, Natural Sciences. Category V, Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathemat\u00ad ics, Computer Science, is satisfied by completion of the School mathematics requirement. Planning a Program of Study Since biological sciences courses are built upon a base of the physical sciences, it is important for students to take their required physical sciences early. Freshmen will normally take eight units of the humanities re\u00ad quirement, Chemistry IA, and a freshman seminar (Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences 2) during the fall quarter. Students with a score of 650 or higher on the mathematics part of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) may enroll in mathematics during the fall quarter. Please note the prerequisites for Mathematics 2A. During winter quarter, students will begin the Biological Sciences Core with Biological Sciences 90. (Although Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences 90 is offered both fall and winter quarters, it is recommended that freshmen enroll in this course winter quarter.) Sophomores begin organic chemistry (Chemistry SIA), con\u00ad tinue the Biological Sciences Core, and complete the Humani\u00ad ties requirement if they have not taken it during their fresh\u00ad man year. Sophomores often begin taking courses in other schools to meet the UCI breadth requirement and fulfill their mathematics requirement if they have not done so as fresh\u00ad men. Sophomores who have completed the mathematics requirement as freshmen may enroll in physics. Students who intend to double major in Chemistry may be required to take Physics SA-B-C in place of Physics 3A-B-C. UC IRVINE - 1982-198366 Biological Sciences During their junior year, most majors continue the Biological Sciences Core and take physics if they have not yet done so. Juniors complete their breadth requirements and often become involved in the satellite course requirements. Since most satellites are based upon material contained in the Core, it is usually preferable for students to have completed most of the Core before taking satellite courses. Finally, during their senior year, students complete the Core and may become involved in an area of specialization within the School. Individualized accelerated programs of study are designed for students entering the School with strong backgrounds in biology. Please see page 67 for details regarding the Fresh\u00ad man Honors Curriculum. A special program of study should be considered by students who enter the biological sciences with a weak background in the sciences and in writing skills. A weak background might consist of not completing high school chemistry or mathe\u00ad matics through trigonometry, and not satisfying the Subject A requirement before entering the University. This program allows a student to gain the necessary background skills and may require five years of study at the undergraduate level. Before beginning this program of study, students must see an academic counselor in the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Freshmen should complete Writing lA, Mathematics 1, Bio\u00ad logical Sciences 2, and an additional humanities course (to satisfy the alternative to the Humanities Core) during the fall quarter. The winter quarter should include Chemistry 10 and continuation of humanities and mathematics. Continuation of humanities and mathematics, and an elective, are taken during the spring quarter. During the second year, students should begin general chem\u00ad istry (Chemistry lA-B-C), continue working on the breadth requirement and any remaining humanities requirements, and complete mathematics. During winter quarter, students Sample Program -Biological Sciences Freshman Sophomore Fall Chern. lA Bio. Core Winter Spring Human. lN Chern. SlA, LA Bio. 2 (Fr. Sem.)

The Biological Sciences Core, organic chemistry (Chemistry SlA-B-C), and elective courses should be taken during the third year. The fourth year should include Physics 3A-B-C, continuation of the Biological Sciences Core, biological sciences satellites, and possibly research or other electives. The fifth year should be relatively free to explore additional satellites and research and to complete any remaining Biolog\u00ad ical Sciences Core courses. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE B.S. DEGREE IN BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES WITH A CONCENTRATION IN ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY The School of Biological Sciences offers a concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology which provides a second pathway to a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences. The concen\u00ad tration in Ecology and Environmental Biology differs from the regular undergraduate program in having a greater emphasis on ecology and the naturalsciences.and a lesser emphasis on chemistry and molecular biology. Its principal objective is to afford the student an integrated, interdisci\u00ad plinary program in environmental studies within the frame\u00ad work of a broad and rigorous physical and biological sciences background. A vital goal is to allow the student completing the course of study to be broadly trained as a biologist, with the breadth of educational experience to view environmental problems from an informed ecologist's perspective. In addi\u00ad tion to completing basic required courses in the humanities and the physical and biological sciences, the student must complete a core of environmentally based courses from the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, the Pro\u00ad gram in Social Ecology, and the School of Engineering. Ex\u00ad posure to current thought in several subareas of ecology is Junior Bio. Core Physics 3A, LA or Electived Bio. Satellitee Elective Bio. Core Physics 3B, LB or Elective Bio.

Satellite Elective students may replace Humanities lA-B-C with another option of the lower\u00b7division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) and a three-quarter breadth sequence in either Humanities or Literature (Category IV. Humanistic Inquiry). Normally students must satisfy the Subject A requirement prior to fulfilling the lower-division writing requirement. Students taking Humanities lA must also enroll in Writing Workshop (2 units) if they have not satisfied the Subject A requirement. bStudents with a score of 650 or higher on the mathematics portion of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) may begin mathematics as freshmen. Students with a score below 650 on the mathematics portion of the SAT should defer mathematics to their sophomore year. Please note the prerequisites for Mathematics 2A. cStudents who have completed mathematics in their freshman year may take Physics 3A-B-C and 3LA-LB-LC in their sophomore year. Students who take the mathematics requirement in their sophomore year should defer physics to their junior year. Physics 3A-B-C is the course for non majors and is fully acceptable for a degree in the Biological Sciences. Physics 5A-B-C, which begins in the winter quarter, better prepares a student for Physical Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C and for some graduate schools. dEiectives should be chosen with the following purposes in mind: UCI breadth requirements; students' own breadth; preprofessional training. eln addition to our listed biological sciences satellite courses, Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C, Physics 18A-B-C, and Psychology 151A-B-C (for Biological Sciences/Psychology double majors) are counted as satellites.

Students with a score below 650 on the mathematics section of the SAT should defer mathematics to their sophomore year. cStudents who have completed mathematics in their freshman year may take Physics 3A-B-C and 3LA-LB-LC in their sophomore year. Students who take the mathematics requirements in their sophomore year should defer physics to their junior year. dElectives should be chosen with the following purposes in mind: breadth requirements; students' own breadth; preprofessional training. eRequired electives are Biological Sciences 171 or 174, Biological Sciences 169 or 179, and two courses from among various Engineering and Social Ecology courses. See School requirements for the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology. emphasized, and the acquisition of elementary statistical and computer skills is stressed. Opportunities to specialize in sev\u00ad eral general study areas are furnished. Students will study theoretical concepts and experimental relationships in terres\u00ad trial or aquatic systems through Ecology and Evolutionary Biology satellite courses, but may also choose to specialize in the demographic and planning aspects of environmental management through classes in Social Ecology, or the techno\u00ad logical approach to environmental problem solving through advanced course work in Environmental Engineering. Students with an engineering perspective are encouraged to explore the program options in Environmental Engineering (p. 21S), offered by the School of Engineering. Students should also investigate the Applied Ecology major (p. 197), offered jointly by the School of Biological Sciences and the Program in Social Ecology. The Applied Ecology major emphasizes ecology as it pertains to human needs, whereas the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology emphasizes ecology as a basic science.

Students must attain a 2.0 grade point average in required Biological Sciences courses. Planning a Program of Study A normal program of study for the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology is similar to that for the regular Biological Sciences major, except that Biological Sciences 102 and 120 are normally taken in the sophomore year. In the junior and senior years a program of study in Ecology and Environmental Biology requires Information and Computer Science IA rather than Biological Sciences 107. In addition, required electives in biological sciences, engineering, and social ecology replace the requirement for three satellite courses. The UCI breadth requirement may be satisfied in the concen\u00ad tration in Ecology and Environmental Biology in a manner similar to the regular Biological Sciences major. Further clarification on the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology may be obtained from the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND COURSES Freshman Honors Curriculum Individually accelerated programs of study can be designed for freshman students who enter the School of Biological Sciences with strong backgrounds in biology and who have achieved scores of 4 or S in the biology section of the Advanced Placement Examination. Such freshmen are exempt from the first course in the Biological Sciences Core (Biological Sciences 90, Diversity of Life) and begin the second Core course (Biological Sciences 101, Evolutionary Biology and Genetics) during the fall quarter of their first year. This program enables participants to complete the fourth Core course by the end of their first year. Any stu\u00ad dent with such Advanced Placement credit should contact the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for more informa\u00ad tion regarding this program. Biological Sciences 199 Every undergraduate student in the School of Biological Sci\u00ad ences has the opportunity to pursue independent research in a professor's laboratory in the School of Biological Sciences or in the UCI-California College of Medicine as an apprentice UC IRVINE - 1982-198368 Biological Sciences scientist. Under the guidance of a senior scientist, the student is able to experience the challenge and excitement of the world of science and to develop new scientific skills. This activity may commence as early as the sophomore year or, in the case of exceptional students, earlier. Interested students should investigate the possibilities for research early in order to obtain a great deal of research experience, if they so desire, before they graduate. Although the School of Biological Sciences does not require training in \u00b7a foreign language, some areas of research demand that stu\u00ad dents possess foreign language skills. Students are, therefore, encouraged to discuss foreign language needs with their advisors to see if such training is important for their own careers. Advising for research careers in the biological sci\u00ad ences is best accomplished by students working together with their faculty advisors. Excellence in Research Program The School of Biological Sciences believes that successful par\u00ad ticipation in creative research is one of the highest academic goals its undergraduates can attain and accordingly rewards such students with Excellence in Biological Sciences Research certificates. Through undergraduate research and the Excel\u00ad lence in Research Program in Biological Sciences, students have the opportunity of presenting the results of their research endeavors to peers and faculty, and possibly of see\u00ad ing their research papers published. Selected papers are pub\u00ad lished in the School's Journal of Undergraduate Research in the Biological Sciences. All Biological Sciences majors doing experimental research under Biological Sciences 199 who have completed a min\u00ad imum of three quarters (with at least one quarter taken dur\u00ad ing the academic year of the symposium) are eligible to par\u00ad ticipate. They must be in good academic standing and making normal progress in biological sciences. Marine Ecology Super Course For the winter quarter of odd years, Biological Sciences 181 (Advanced Marine Ecology) and 182 (Applied Marine Produc\u00ad tivity), or a similar grouping, are combined into a Marine Ecology Super Course. These courses, with a Biological Sci\u00ad ences 199 research course, constitute a student's entire win\u00ad ter quarter curriculum. The course is limited to 20 students with selection based on a questionnaire and interview. Pre\u00ad requisites are completion of Biological Sciences 102 and con\u00ad sent of instructor. Terrestrial Ecology Super Course For the spring quarter of even years, Biological Sciences 167 (Field Ecology), 173 (Physiological Animal Ecology), and 184 (Insect Ecology), or a similar grouping, are combined into a Terrestrial Ecology Super Course. These courses, with a Bio\u00ad logical Sciences 199 research course, constitute a student's entire spring quarter curriculum. The course is limited to 20 students with selection based on a questionnaire and inter\u00ad view. Prerequisites are completion of Biological Sciences 102 and consent of instructor. Undergraduate Seminars In addition to research opportunities, there are freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior seminars which enable stu\u00ad dents to meet in small groups with individual professors. Topics vary from quarter to quarter. Exciting developments in modern biology as well as other topics of interest to stu\u00ad dents are discussed. Some of the areas are regeneration, developmental biology of marine invertebrates, immunology, regulation of enzyme action and synthesis, human ecology, population ecology, experimental neuroanatomy, and neural and endocrine bases of behavior. Undergraduate Teaching Opportunities Through the Education Motivation Program and the Tutor\u00ad ing Program, students can immediately put to practice skills they have learned in their biology training. These programs provide opportunities for students to develop teaching abili\u00ad ties and to perform a worthwhile and necessary service. In the Education Motivation Program, present biological sci\u00ad ences majors go into the elementary and junior high schools to motivate students toward a career in the sciences. In the Tutoring Program, UCI students tutor other UCI students in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics. 3-2 Program in the Graduate School of Management Students who are interested in a career in administration and who will have completed all of the course requirements for a degree in Biological Sciences by the end of their junior year may apply to a cooperative 3-2 program which leads to a Master's degree in Management as well as the Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences. During the senior year, stu\u00ad dents take courses in management which count toward the 180 elective units needed to receive the Bachelor's degree. Upon successful completion of the required courses and units, usually at the conclusion of the first year in the 3-2 program, the B.S. degree in the Biological Sciences will be awarded. The degree in Management will be awarded after successful completion of course requirements, ordinar\u00ad ily at the end of the fifth year. SPECIAL RESEARCH RESOURCES Special research resources include the Laser Microbeam Pro\u00ad gram (LAMP), a research, training, and service facility in the area of laser microbeam technology; the School of Biological Sciences Biohazard (P-3) Facility, which provides laboratory facilities for working with biological agents or biological molecules such as recombinant DNA which would be haz\u00ad ardous when used in open laboratories; the Museum of Sys\u00ad tematic Biology, a teaching and research facility which cur\u00ad rently contains material on local populations of plants, inver\u00ad tebrates, and vertebrates; the Developmental Biology Center, devoted to analyzing developmental mechanisms in amphibi\u00ad ans, insects, and other invertebrates; the Irvine Arboretum, a botanical garden facility; the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve, which supports controlled marsh biota; the Burns Pinon Ridge Reserve, a high-desert habitat in San Bernardino County; and the UCI Ecological Preserve, which includes coastal hills on the campus, once under heavy grazing, but now returning to a more natural state. It is important to note that the School has access to the on-campus UCI-California College of Medicine, thereby providing an opportunity for the sharing of both teaching and research activities. ADVISING: ACADEMIC, CAREER, HEALTH SCIENCES Academic Advising The Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office coordinates the advising program and provides academic counseling as well as special services particularly in the area of preprofes\u00ad sional career counseling. The Office also houses the office of the Counselor for Special Programs. This office is responsible for academic counseling, coordination of special services, and professional career counseling specifically for minority and EOP (Educational Opportunity Program) students. All freshmen will be enrolled in small-group freshman seminars (Biological Sciences 2). All other new students will be enrolled in special sections of Biological Sciences 190. The UC IRVINE - 1982-1983professor conducting the seminar will be the student's faculty advisor. Upper-division peer advisors will be actively involved in these seminars. Peer Academic Advisors. The Peer Academic Advisors are upper-division Biological Sciences majors who bring with them valuable academic and social experiences. Their func\u00ad tions include counseling students in matters of major selec\u00ad tion, program planning, petitioning, tutoring, learning skills problems, and participation in cocurricular and extracurricu\u00ad lar activities. The Peer Advisors are located near the Student Affairs Office. Office hours are posted at the beginning of each quarter, and anyone should feel free to drop by and discuss any social or academic problems. Career Advising Information on graduate and professional schools in the health sciences can be obtained from the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Additional career information and job opportunities are available through the UCI Career Planning and Placement Office. The Student Affairs Office has devel\u00ad oped a complete career library and a close relationship with the Career Planning and Placement Center in an effort to provide current, relevant career information for biology stu\u00ad dents. Special events designed to provide career information are the annual Biological Sciences Career Fair and monthly career workshops, both of which are cosponsored by the Student Affairs Office and the Career Planning and Place\u00ad ment Center. Areas of opportunity open to those with a Bachelor of Sci\u00ad ence degree include laboratory technology, publishing, tech\u00ad nical editing, pharmaceutical sales, and training programs in county, state, and federal agencies. The bachelor's degree is necessary to pursue studies leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. A B.S. degree, plus short training periods, may prepare stu\u00ad dents for employment in education, medical technology (usu\u00ad ally one year), physical therapy, and various other areas. Education (community colleges, state colleges, or private schools), medical illustration, and public health (which includes hospital administration, biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health sciences, social work, public health education, maternal and child health, and infectious and trop\u00ad ical diseases) are fields in which opportunities are available upon completion of a Master's program. The Ph.D. degree may lead to research in many areas, among them bacteriology, biochemistry, biometeorology, botany, cytology, ecology, fish\u20acry biology, genetics, home economics, microbiology, pathology, physiology, psychobiology, public health, range management, soil conservation, and zoology. Other areas where advanced degrees are necessary include medicine, dentistry, law, optometry, podiatry, osteopathy, and veterinary medicine. Health Sciences Advising Advising for careers in the health sciences is a specialty of the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Students desiring to enter the health sciences should have their programs checked in the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. They should also check deadlines for taking the New Medical College Admission Test or other required tests and applica\u00ad tion deadlines. The New Medical College Admission Test, required by most medical schools, is administered in spring and fall of each year on the Irvine campus. This test should be taken in the spring, a year and one-half before the student plans to enter medical school. Biological Sciences 69 Many of our students desire a career related to their educa\u00ad tion in the biological sciences. Students can go into medicine, dentistry, optometry, osteopathy, podiatry, veterinary medi\u00ad cine, and related medical fields; into teaching; and into research in the biological sciences. In properly preparing for such careers, planning is essential early in a student's education. Leaders in dental, medical, and veterinary education recom\u00ad mend that students preparing to seek admission to their schools plan to obtain a bachelor's degree. Students who plan to enter a school of dentistry, medicine, or other areas of the health sciences may receive the required preprofessional training on the Irvine campus. This preprofessional training may be accomplished by (1) completing the major in Biological Sciences or (2) majoring in any school or department and ful\u00ad filling concurrently the specific course requirements of the dental, medical, or other professional school the student expects to attend. Students interested in the health sciences should choose elec\u00ad tives in the social sciences, possibly a foreign language, physi\u00ad cal chemistry, or other specific courses required or recom\u00ad mended by graduate schools. Health Sciences Advisory Committee The Health Sciences Advisory Committee consists of faculty and academic counselors in the School of Biological Sciences. The Committee offers specialized services to all students applying to postgraduate professional schools in the health sciences, including (1) a Committee interview and letter of recommendation for most professional school applications, (2) a personal file containing the student's letters of recom\u00ad mendation, and (3) a service of sending all recommendations for a student to professional and graduate schools. STUDENT PARTICIPATION BSSA. The School of Biological Sciences highly recommends undergraduate participation in its student organizations. The Biological Sciences Student Association (BSSA) is an auton\u00ad omous student-run organization which provides a liaison among the administration, science faculty, Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office, other biology-oriented organizations, and other students. Some of its activities include teaching evaluations, an annual Biofaire, special quarterly events, pub\u00ad lication of a list of 199 research courses available in the Bio\u00ad logical Sciences, and a quarterly newsletter. AED. Alpha Epsilon Delta (AED) is a national honor society for students preparing for careers in the health professions. AED strives to stimulate an appreciation of health careers through interaction among prehealth students, health educa\u00ad tors, and practitioners in a variety of health care fields. AED annually sponsors student tours of professional schools, an interview techniques workshop, guest lecturers, and a series of workshops on selecting, applying to, and financing medical school, as well as many other campus activities. BSSO. The Black Students in Science Organization (BSSO) was established to maintain a unified and supportive com\u00ad munity of successful Black science and prehealth professional majors at UCI. The group holds biweekly meetings; sponsors guest speakers; provides academic support in the form of study sessions, examinations, and study aids from previous courses; organizes trips to medical schools, hospitals, and conferences; arranges gatherings with doctors and medical students; hosts fund-raising events; and compiles and dissem\u00ad inates information on careers, conferences, hospital and laboratory positions, and issues affecting the Black commu- UC IRVINE - 1982-198370 Biological Sciences nity in particular. BSSO also works in close association with the UCI-California College of Medicine chapter of the Stu\u00ad dent National Medical Association. Major achievements have included \"BSSO Week\" and the cosponsoring of an annual \"UCI-CCM Third Pre-Medical Awareness Conference.\" CCM. Chicanos in Creative Medicine (CCM) was established to promote interaction among Chicano/Latino students majoring in the Biological Sciences. Some of the activities include lectures by prominent scientists, opportunities to visit graduate schools, and an annual dance. The major aim of CCM is to help members attain the goal of their choice-be it medical school, graduate school, or any science-related profession. Medspur. Medspur, conceived in 1977, is dedicated to serving prehealth professional students in both social and academic endeavors while at UCI. As the largest registered campus organization, Medspur brings together each year well over 500 students into the club who are interested in pursuing professional careers in human and animal medicine and in dentistry. Medspur's main goal is to bring students together in an environment conducive to the development of coopera\u00ad tion and friendship. Medspur is committed to providing members with the opportunity to learn about the realities of their prospective careers and the issues which face the health-care specialist. Medspur invites members of the medical community to speak about their professions and organizes student/faculty interac\u00ad tions, dances, MCAT preparation sessions, and Chemistry 1A-B-C, Chemistry 51A-B-C, and Biological Sciences 90 examination reviews. The highlight of each year is the annual UCI Medspur Southland Pre-Health Conference which allows students to explore all aspects of the health-care professions. Biological Sciences Chapter of the UCI Alumni Association. Recently, the UCI Alumni Association approved the forma\u00ad tion of the Biological Sciences Chapter of the UCI Alumni Association. The Chapter has been formed to fulfill several objectives: (1) to serve the educational, social, and profes\u00ad sional career aims of the alumni of the School of Biological Sciences, (2) to provide the School with an active and informed alumni support group, (3) to act as an interface between the School and the business, government, and local communities, (4) to assist current students in defining and reaching their career objectives, and (5) to serve as a refer\u00ad ence to all current Biological Sciences majors by providing them with information on career issues. The Chapter will provide Biological Sciences alumni with a continuing identifi\u00ad cation with UCI; provide a focal point for alumni activities on an intellectual, professional, and social basis; provide a strong link between the School and the local corporate and scientific communities; and provide continuing relevant feedback from alumni to the School. GRADUATE PROGRAM The School of Biological Sciences offers graduate study in a wide variety of fields ranging across the spectrum of the bio\u00ad logical sciences. The four Departments of the School of Bio\u00ad logical Sciences (Developmental and Cell Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Psychobiology) and four Departments of the UCI-Cali\u00ad fornia College of Medicine (Anatomy, Biological Chemistry, Microbiology, and Physiology and Biophysics) cooperate in the conduct of a unified graduate program, administered by the School of Biological Sciences. The organization of the Departments encourages an interdisciplinary approach to scientific problems, especially at the graduate level. All programs of study, regardless of emphasis, lead to the degrees of Master of Science (M.S.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D) in the Biological Sciences (with the exception of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics which offers only the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences). At the current time, applica\u00ad tions for the M.A.T. are not being accepted. Each Department has a graduate advisor whom students may consult in regard to the technical details of their individual programs. Applications for admission to graduate study are evaluated both by the Division of Graduate Studies and Research and by the School or the Department to which the student has applied on the basis of letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, grades, and other qualifications of the applicant. Candidates for graduate admission are urged to consult the department(s) whose faculty and expertise best fit their interests. Some faculty are members of an interdisciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group. These faculty are from the Department of Chemistry in the School of Physical Sciences; the Departments of Developmental and Cell Biology and Molecular Biology and Biochemistry in the School of Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences; and the Department of Physiology and Biophys\u00ad ics in the UCI-California College of Medicine. This program provides an opportunity for interaction among graduate stu\u00ad dents and faculty who share common interests in biophysics and biophysical chemistry. Participating graduate students pursue a degree in the department best suited to their own background and research interests. A program of seminars brings the group together monthly to discuss research prob\u00ad lems of mutual interest, and a regular series of interdiscipli\u00ad nary courses is offered by the participating faculty to provide formal instruction in areas encompassed by biophysics and biophysical chemistry. Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy in the Biological Sciences While both the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy programs are offered (with the exception of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics), emphasis at the graduate level is on the Ph.D. programs. Most training takes place within one of the departments, although full facilities and curricular offer\u00ad ings are available to all graduate students in all departments of the biological sciences. Interdisciplinary study and research are encouraged. Students are expected to maintain a B average at all times, attain the Master's degree in two years, and attain the Ph.D. in four or five years, depending on departmental affiliation. A Master's degree, however, is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree. Each new student is assigned a faculty member as a tempor\u00ad ary advisor. During the first part of the initial year of gradu\u00ad ate work, the student plans an academic program in consulta\u00ad tion with the graduate advisor or a small committee. Faculty advisors are changed if the specific interests of the student change. Students are encouraged to consult with other faculty members with regard to their research and academic interests. During their graduate training all students will serve some time as teacher apprentices under the direction of advanced teaching assistants and faculty. Advanced graduate students may work closely with faculty in the planning and execution of the teaching program. The amount and exact nature of the teaching experience varies with the department. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Master of Science Plan 1: Thesis Plan -The student completes seven upper\u00ad division or graduate courses including a minimum of five nonresearch courses. The student then presents a thesis based upon research done while in the School. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Plan -The student completes a minimum of nine upper-division and graduate courses. At least six must be graduate courses (numbered 200-299) in the student's field specialization. This program is terminated with a comprehensive final examination. Doctor of Philosophy First Level of Competence- The student attains this level by completing oral or written examinations at the discretion of the department. Second Level of Competence -This level is attained by pass\u00ad ing an examination dealing with the student's particular interests. A committee for the purpose of administering this examination is appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Once this examination is completed, the student is advanced to candidacy for the degree and is considered to have for\u00ad mally begun dissertation research. The student submits a dis\u00ad sertation on this research and defends it at an oral examina\u00ad tion during the final year of graduate study.

Schneiderman: Developmental biology and insect physiology Grover C. Stephens: Comparative animal physiology The Department of Developmental and Cell Biology is con\u00ad cerned with the development, physiology, structure, and function of organisms and their component cells. The main emphasis of the Developmental and Cell Biology graduate program is research training in either developmental and cell biology or comparative physiology of animals and plants. The Department maintains facilities for research involving bio\u00ad chemistry; genetics; electron microscopy; cell, tissue, and organism culture; microsurgery; and neurophysiology. Students in the Department of Developmental and Cell Biol\u00ad ogy generally enter one of two graduate curricula. In the first year, those emphasizing comparative physiology take a three\u00ad quarter sequence of organismic physiology (Developmental and Cell Biology 210). Those emphasizing developmental and cell biology take a series of courses (five out of a possible eight) in the first two years. The selection of the first-year course program is made in consultation with a faculty advi\u00ad sory committee when the student first arrives on the cam\u00ad pus. This committee monitors the student's progress through the first year after which the student's thesis committee is established and takes over the advising function. Students are able to diverge from this basic Core into their areas of special interest by means of graduate seminar courses in sub\u00ad sequent years. At the end of the first year students in com\u00ad parative physiology take an oral examination that covers a broad area in the general and related fields of interest to that student. Students in developmental and cell biology prepare and defend a research proposal and are examined in fields related to the proposal. Since many doctoral students in the Department undertake academic careers, the Department expects each graduate student to participate in a directed teaching experience during the graduate program. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D degree within five years or less.

Marsh: General entomology Eloy Eco-biological function of plant toxins; plant chemi- cal ecology; biological and cellular chemistry of plant products Philip W. Runde!: Physiological plant ecology John T. Smiley: Plant-insect interactions Grover C. Stephens: Comparative animal physiology Ecology and evolutionary biology deals with the establish\u00ad ment of adaptations over evolutionary time and with the sig\u00ad nificance of these adaptations in ecological time. The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology focuses on problems at the population and community levels, with par\u00ad ticular emphasis placed on coevolved processes. While the Department has faculty specialists in plant and animal ecol\u00ad ogy and in marine and terrestrial ecology, primary attention is given to important ecological questions rather than to par\u00ad ticular habitats or taxa. Faculty and graduate student research is often centered at the interface of two or more of these specialties. Departmental research activities include eco\u00ad logical energetics, plant-herbivore and plant-pollinator inter\u00ad actions, population and reproductive ecology, and community UC IRVINE - 1982-198378 Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ecology. These research endeavors attempt to achieve a bal\u00ad ance between empirical and theoretical approaches to evolu\u00ad tionary and ecological problems. Primary emphasis in the Department graduate program is placed on training leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences; under exceptional circumstances, a student may be admitted initially to the M.S. program. All entering students are required to enroll during the first year in a two-quarter graduate core sequence. At the end of the first year, these students will complete an oral examination based upon the core courses and other materials the Department might require. Satisfactory performance on this examination is required for continuation in the graduate program. Students entering with a B.A. or B.S. degree will enroll in the graduate core for two consecutive years, while those entering with an M.A. or M.S. degree will enroll only for the initial year. Each entering graduate student will be assigned a faculty advisor and a three-person advisory committee for guidance, with whom the student will meet at least once each quarter. All students are encouraged to submit a research proposal to their advisory committee during their first year of residency. A comprehensive proposal is required before the end of the second year. The progress of each student is reviewed by the departmental faculty before the end of each academic year. Normally, all requirements for the Ph.D. should be completed within five years. No more than seven years will be allowed for completion of the program. Prior to advancement to can\u00ad didacy for the Ph.D., students must satisfy two breadth requirements at the discretion of their advisory committee. One of these must be satisfied with a foreign language and the second by the attainment of an additional skill equivalent to a second foreign language (i.e., a second foreign language, demonstrated skills in computer-statistics, attainment of unusual technical expertise necessary for dissertation research, etc.). Advancement to doctoral candidacy by a com\u00ad prehensive oral examination will be expected during the third year for students entering with a B.A. or B.S. or during the second year for those entering with an M.A. or M.S. Appli\u00ad cants for this program should have a solid undergraduate program in biology and ecology, emphasizing both research and field work. In addition, course work in statistics, mathe\u00ad matics, and physical and chemical sciences is expected. All applicants are required to submit verbal, quantitative, and advanced biology GRE scores. The deadline for application is February 1.

The importance of developmental and com\u00ad parative approaches to these problems is stressed. The Department of Psychobiology offers graduate training leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences. Graduate students must complete a sequence of core courses (lectures and laboratories) during their first and second years. They also UC IRVINE - 1982-1983must take a minimum of four advanced courses before grad\u00ad uation and must participate in directed research and teaching each year. To advance to candidacy, the student must prepare a critical review paper in the area of the proposed dissertation research and must pass an oral examination in psychobiology by the end of the third year. Graduation depends on success\u00ad ful preparation and oral defense of a dissertation based on the student's research. Students are expected to complete this program in four years of study. Ideally, applicants for this program should have taken under\u00ad graduate courses in biology (one introductory year plus some advanced work), psychology (experimental, physiological, and learning), chemistry through biochemistry, introductory physics, calculus, and statistics. They also must submit gen\u00ad eral aptitude GRE test scores. Because graduate training emphasizes research, preference is given to applicants having laboratory research experience as undergraduates. The Department accepts only those students seeking a doctorate, though students who do not successfully complete their course work or do not advance to candidacy may, with the consent of the faculty, complete a Master's thesis and receive an M.S. degree in Biological Sciences. Applicants with sub\u00ad stantial outside commitments that would curtail laboratory research or prolong the time to degree are not accepted.

Dearden, Acting Chair: Growth inhibition and pulmonary edema interactions Christine nervous system morphological plasticity Roland A. Giolli: Experimental neuroanatomy; visual system Herbert system forebrain organization John E. Swett: Sensory-motor systems of the spinal cord Raymond B. Wuerker: Neuropathology The Department of Anatomy in the UCI-California College of Medicine offers a doctoral program leading to the Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences, with specialized research train\u00ad ing in the neurosciences. Research programs in the neuro\u00ad sciences include neurotransmitter immunocytochemistry, the central neural regulation of circadian rhythms, forebrain organization, and organization and development of sensory systems. Research programs also include growth inhibition, cartilage, and pulmonary edema. The Department maintains research facilities so that the student can become experienced with the following data. Students are encour\u00ad aged to become proficient in multiple areas of study using numerous techniques in various species. Students in the Department of Anatomy have two major goals. The first goal is to attain the technical skills, theoretical background, and experimental knowledge necessary to con\u00ad duct innovative and fundamentally sound research. The second goal is to become knowledgeable anatomists with the ability to teach graduate, undergraduate, and professional courses in anatomy and neuroscience. These two goals are achieved through a basic and extended academic program that is tailored to the individual needs of the student. The core curriculum is designed to provide all students with a fundamental knowledge of gross, cellular, and subcellular anatomy; physiology; and biochemistry. In the first year, stu\u00ad dents are required to take neuroanatomy, microscopic anat\u00ad omy, embryology, gross anatomy, biochemistry, and physiol\u00ad ogy. Over the usual four-year training period the student is required to complete a practical course in statistics, four departmental seminar courses, four laboratory tutorials, and a total of SO credit hours of research in anatomy. Elective courses in the Department of Anatomy or other departments on campus may also be taken; examples include pharmacol\u00ad ogy, psychobiology, cell biology, genetics, computer science, pathology, and physiology. The student typically devotes the majority of the first year to taking core courses and about half of the second year to taking electives. Only a minimum of the third year is spent taking courses. Each year following the first year, the student is expected to act as an assistant in one major anatomy core course. When a student is accepted into the graduate program, the student and the Graduate Committee decide to which labora\u00ad tories the student will be assigned the first year. During the first year the student will spend approximately 25 percent of the time doing research. At the beginning of the second year the student and the Graduate Committee select a faculty sponsor who will supervise the dissertation research. An oral Qualifying Examination at the end of the summer of the second year is given to the student by a Candidacy Commit\u00ad tee. The examination covers anatomy and focuses on the candidate's field of specialization. The dissertation research is chosen by the student and faculty advisor under guidance of the Graduate Committee. The majority of the second, third, and fourth years is devoted to completing the research and preparing a written disserta\u00ad tion suitable for publication. An oral defense of the dissertation research before the stu\u00ad dent's advisor and Doctoral Committee constitutes the final examination. The Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences is awarded following completion of all the requirements, a pro\u00ad cess that normally will take four years to complete.

We are committed to the creative act: to making and performing. A program based on such a commitment requires a faculty experienced in the creative process. The faculty in the School of Fine Arts is comprised primarily of permanent artists-in-residence. Studio courses in all areas are taught by eminent faculty who have earned their living professionally and who continue to maintain profes\u00ad sional assignments and commitments. In addition to the permanent artists-in-residence faculty, vis\u00ad iting artists comprise about one-third of the staff, providing a constant inflow of ideas and personalities. A variety of artists challenges the students' sensibilities and encourages them to think and to create freshly and freely. The focus on the creative process, the professional and scholar-performer faculty, and the individual's commitment and courage provide, we feel, an ideal condition for the serious student in the arts who wants to be painting, sculp\u00ad turing, dancing, acting, singing, directing, choreographing, writing, or playing an instrument six to 10 hours a day dur\u00ad ing the most sensitive and formative years of life. Our cen\u00ad tral concern is the development of a creative talent in an atmosphere of creative activity. In addition to programs con\u00ad cerned primarily with studio and performance activity, courses of study in the history and theory of the arts are offered as major areas of concentration. The School of Fine Arts is organized into areas of instruction rather than with formal departments. Undergraduate majors are offered in Fine Arts (General Interdisciplinary), History of Art, Studio Art, Dance, Drama, and Music. Requirements include extensive studio and work\u00ad shop experiences, essential theoretical and historical back\u00ad ground studies, and exercises in criticism. The requirements for all performing and studio majors in the fine arts are designed to provide opportunities for the student-artist to work creatively for at least four hours a day from the fresh\u00ad man year through graduation. Courses in film writing and television are available in the Drama program. A student who wishes to pursue a double major by combin\u00ad ing two majors from the School of Fine Arts or by combining a major from the School with a major from another academic unit may do so with the proviso that only one major can be officially declared until the senior year. At that time, when the requirements for both majors are nearly completed, the student can be approved as a double major. In addition to producing student concerts, musicals, and dramatic performances, the School of Fine Arts presents a varied offering of cultural events each year, including distin\u00ad guished lecturers, world-renowned concert artists, outstand\u00ad ing dance and drama groups, jazz and folk performers, a film series, and a gallery program. The Fine Arts Village includes studio and classroom space for the areas of History of Art, Studio Art, Dance, Drama, and Music. Specialized facilities for the studio art area include an Art Gallery and six well-lighted studios for drawing, paint\u00ad ing, sculpture, graphics, and ceramics. Power equipment for sculpture, two presses for graphics (intaglio), print making and lithography, and two kilns for ceramics are available. The Village Theatre, conventionally designed; contains an orches\u00ad tra pit, a large, completely equipped stage, and seating for 420 people. The Concert Hall, seating 230, has a thrust plat\u00ad form stage, a Baroque pipe organ, and excellent acoustics. The Studio Theatre provides an experimental stage base without fixed seats, allowing complete freedom in determin\u00ad ing the style of production. The Little Theatre, located in Humanities Hall, and the Virginia and Norman Nixon Studio Theatre are intimate proscenium theatres for Drama Work\u00ad shops and graduate directing projects. All theatres are com\u00ad pletely equipped with modern sound and lighting systems, and students involved in productions work in completely equipped and professionally operated scenery and costume shops. Campus television studios are also located in the Vil\u00ad lage. Music students attend orchestra rehearsals in a special Village facility also utilized for choral and instrumental ensemble rehearsals. Practice rooms are equipped with Steinway and other practice pianos, and Steinway concert grands are used in concerts. A music listening laboratory is also available to music students. Dance classes in ballet, mod\u00ad ern, and jazz are held in four locations: the two main studios in the Fine Arts Village, Crawford Hall (gymnasium), and the Studio Theatre. In addition to their formal instruction and participation, stu\u00ad dents in the School of Fine Arts and qualified students from other academic areas are involved at a less formal level as participants, organizers, and coordinators throughout the year in the various productional units, including University Chorus, UCI Symphony Orchestra, University Theatre, Stu\u00ad dent Exhibitions, Graduate Art Gallery, Dance Concerts, Dance Workshop, Drama Workshop, Music and Opera Work\u00ad shop, and Television Production. The opportunity is provided for all qualified UCI students to participate in the UCI Pep Band and Song Leaders, and to receive course credit for this participation. Those interested should see the instructor of Theatre Orchestra, Drama 173, about requirements for participation and enrollment in the appropriate course. All new Fine Arts students are assigned or may choose their own faculty advisors and are encouraged to meet with them during orientation week and periodically throughout the year to plan programs of study and to discuss educational and career objectives. In addition, students are invited to make use of the counseling services in the Fine Arts Counseling Office for assistance with programs, requirements, or any academic matter.

School Requirements: None (see under programs). GRADUATE PROGRAM The School of Fine Arts offers a program leading to the degree of Master of Fine Arts (in Fine Arts) with concentra\u00ad tions in Studio Art, Dance, Drama, and Music. The primary activity of the School of Fine Arts is performance-the crea\u00ad tive act. Research activities are concerned with illuminating performance and inspiring the studio experience. The intel\u00ad lectual activity of theoretical, literary, and historical courses complements the practical work in studio workshops and per\u00ad formance. The aim of the program is, thus, to produce liter\u00ad ate artists\u00b7 who are responsive to intellectual stimuli, who are capable of integrating knowledge into creative acts, and who are disciplined to the point of freedom. It is the strong belief of the School that intellectual integrity and professional excellence cannot exist without each other. Admission to the Program Applications are accepted for fall quarter admission only, and ordinarily must be completed by March I as the number of graduate students that can be admitted to the School of Fine Arts is limited. Applicants are advised to arrange for audi\u00ad tions, interviews, and the submission of portfolios, composi\u00ad tions, and dossiers, as appropriate, by March I. Students applying for scholarships and fellowships should do so by March I, and are also encouraged to apply for financial assistance through the Financial Aid Office. The School of Fine Arts has a modest number of teaching assistantships available in all areas, and all candidates are automatically reviewed for teaching assistantship positions; the School informs successful candidates by June I for the following academic year. Upon admission to the program the student will be assigned an advisor. The student should discuss with this advisor the scope of undergraduate preparation to determine any areas which may need strengthening if the student is to derive full benefit from graduate study. FINE ARTS GENERAL INTERDISCIPLINARY The program in general interdisciplinary studies is designed for students who wish to combine the various disciplines in fine arts. Although participation in studio classes is required, the program emphasizes the study of the history, theory, and criticism of the arts in three of the School's instructional areas. The nature of the program provides each student the opportunity to plan a uniquely individual course of study with the approval of an advisor. Upon completion of this program, students will be awarded the B.A. in Fine Arts with General Interdisciplinary as the area of concentration. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page I2. School Requirements: None. Program Requirements Three one-year surveys in three different areas of the arts selected from Fine Arts 20A-B-C, Art History 40A-B-C, Dance 110A-B-C, Dance 112A-B-C, Drama 40A-B-C, Music 40A-B-C, or Fine Arts IOOA-B-C; nine performance/studio courses (e.g., acting, ballet, drawing, chorus, orchestra); six upper-division courses in the history, theory, and criticism of the arts in at least two areas of the arts; a senior thesis; two years in a single European language at Universjty level (through 2C) or equivalent competence; related courses in disciplines other than fine arts are encouraged.

The program is concerned with understanding the function and characteristics of the monuments of civilization. Artists' intentions and achievements are studied in their historical settings. Students majoring in the history of art should select appropriate courses in classics, history, literature, and philos\u00ad ophy, as well as in other areas of the fine arts. All majors in the history of art are encouraged to study a second language beyond the minimum program requirement of two years in a single language at the university level. Careers for the History of Art Major A Bachelor's degree in the History of Art is excellent prepa\u00ad ration for pursuing either a career as an art historian or museum curator, or professional study in an entirely differ\u00ad ent discipline. History of Art majors have gone on to gradu\u00ad ate and professional school to study art history, archaeology, law, library science, business (in some cases with special focus in the fine arts), or teacher education. The study of the His\u00ad tory of Art is a valuable part of a liberal education that pro\u00ad vides a means of looking at the history and culture of both the past and the present through the world's great masterpieces. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page I2. School Requirements: None.

University of Arizona, Chair and Lecturer in Studio Art (new directions in art forms) Ed Berea!, Chouinard Art Institute, Lecturer in Studio Art (live art performance using social/political themes, video documentation and presentation) Tony DeLap, Claremont Graduate School, Professor of Studio Art (architectural paintings and forms) John Paul Jones, M.F.A. University of Iowa, Professor of Studio Art (suspended sculptural constructions of wood and metal which often use elements of light or movement) Craig Kauffman, M.F.A. University of California, Los Angeles, Professor of Studio Art (formal paintings using silk, rhoplex, and paper, incorporating both Japanese and French interior school elements) Melinda Wortz, M.A. University of California, Los Angeles, Lecturer in Studio Art, Director of the University Gallery (art history, with emphasis on contemporary artists and exhibitions) The program in studio art provides basic studio experiences in the fundamental knowledge and techniques of drawing, painting, sculpture, ceramics, and graphics (printmaking), and a study of the history and criticism of art. The curriculum constantly relates studio practice to the development of the visual arts and current critical theory. It aims to develop a sense of visual awareness by as wide a range of the study of art as possible. The student majoring in art experiences the creative aspects of art by learning to think with the materials and techniques of the medium. Careers for the Studio Art Major UC Irvine's Studio Art faculty and gallery exhibitions have provided the starting point for a great many prospective practicing artists. An unusually high percentage of Studio Art alumni have gone on to successful careers as profes\u00ad sional, exhibiting artists. Many graduates teach at all levels and work in museums as curators or preparators (those who prepare the gallery for an exhibit and hang or install the works). A Studio Art major is also good preparation for further study at the graduate level. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 12. School Requirements: None. Program Requirements Studio Major: Art Studio 30A-B-C; Art History 40A-B-C or any three courses from Art History 20A-B-C-D-E-F; one year in lower-division studio courses in sequence; three courses in history of modern art; 12 upper-division studio courses (Art Studio 145 through 194).

General Information The M.F.A. program focuses primarily on development of experimental concepts and format relevant to contemporary issues as they affect visual arts, rather than on processes of traditional techniques and ideas. A smalL personal environ\u00ad ment supports the individual's efforts in research, develop\u00ad ment, and exhibition of ideas by providing as much latitude for special needs as possible. By meeting with students on a one-to-one basis or in small groups, a variety of art experi\u00ad ences occur. Internships, selected field trips, contemporary exhibitions in the Art Gallery, contact with visiting profes\u00ad sional artists, and seminars provide the framework for the program. Because of the limited physical facilities; studio space is arranged privately. Admission Applicants for admission to the degree program must meet the general requirements for admission to graduate study, hold a B.A. or B.F.A. in Art, and submit by March I a port\u00ad folio of their creative work. Normally, anyone who has earned an M.F.A. degree in Studio Art will not be considered for admission into the program. General Degree Requirements Normally two years of residence are required. Each candidate must enroll for three courses each quarter for six quarters, exclusive of summer sessions. The student's progress and body of work will be reviewed by a faculty committee, on a regular basis, yearly. A satisfactory opinion by this committee will allow the student to progress to candidacy for the degree. Satisfactory attainment must be demonstrated by a specific creative project. This project is to be supported by a thesis incorporating visual and written material relevant to the pro\u00ad ject and the candidate's creative research while at UCI. Oral defense of the project and essay may be required to test the candidate's general knowledge in the area in which the pro\u00ad ject falls. Specific Degree Requirements Seventy-two quarter units in graduate or approved upper\u00ad division undergraduate courses must be completed with a grade of at least B or the letter grade S in each course. Not more than 20 units in upper-division courses may count toward the degree. Electives may be taken in any discipline. The 72 units will normally be made up in the following manner: First Year: three courses in Graduate Problems (215); three seminars in Problems of Contemporary Art (230); three courses in Graduate Projects (240). Second Year: two courses in Graduate Problems (215); three seminars in Problems of Contemporary Art (230); three courses in Graduate Projects (240); one course in Thesis (260).

Barbara Plunk, Visiting Lecturer in Dance (ballet technique, teaching of dance, theory) Larry Rosenberg, B.A. University of California, Los Angeles, Eliot Feld Ballet, Visiting Lecturer in Dance (ballet) The program in dance provides studio experiences in the fundamental knowledge and techniques of classical ballet and of contemporary dance movements. The classical academic approach to ballet adheres to those principles developed from Noverre through Petipa and Cecchetti modified to accommo\u00ad date our current understanding of those laws of physics and of the human anatomy applicable to the study of dance. The workshops in contemporary dance explore and extend the various approaches to modern dance and jazz, concentrating on physiological and rhythmic problems encountered in con\u00ad temporary choreography. Studies in preclassic dance forms and their musical structures provide additional workshop experience as well as significant research materials for chore\u00ad ographic problems. Theoretical and historical courses com\u00ad plement the practical work in workshops, choreography, and performance. The program is designed for students preparing to continue professionally as dancers, as choreographers, and as teachers, as well as for students who, while not planning to make dance their vocation, have a serious interest in the theory, practice, and history of dance. The traditional technique of classical ballet constitutes a craft and style that serves not only as a physiological center for the logical training of the body, but also as a basic language of movement for the choreographer. Workshop experiences build progressively on the techniques of ballet and extend through the contemporary idioms of modern and jazz. The aim is to develop kinetic resources, precision, flexibility, and freedom in a coordinated and intelligently responsive body. Careers for the Dance Major In addition to the perhaps more obvious careers in profes\u00ad sional dance, choreography, and teaching, a major in Dance also can serve as a basis for graduate study or job opportuni\u00ad ties in, for example, dance therapy, dance history, kinesiology/ anatomy, and dance notation. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 12. School Requirements: None. Performance Requirements Students planning to major in dance should develop basic ability in techniques of ballet and modern dance forms. Although freshmen entering with fewer than 12 units are not required to audition, a placement examination is offered. The evaluation of the examination indicates the level of ballet and modern at which the student is placed. Freshmen declar\u00ad ing the dance major are encouraged to take the placement examination, especially if they feel they could be placed at a higher level than Ballet I and Modern I. At the end of the sophomore year, the faculty will determine whether the stu\u00ad dent is making sufficient progress to proceed as an upper\u00ad division major. All advanced standing applicants (entering students with 12 units or more) to the University who have indicated an inter\u00ad est in majoring in dance are required to audition and will be notified by the School of the date. Evaluations of the stu\u00ad dent's audition will indicate whether or not the student may major in dance and will indicate the appropriate placement level in ballet and modern for students admitted to the major. This placement level determines the minimum amount of years it will take to complete the degree requirements. Inasmuch as the level of performance ability generally deter\u00ad mines the length of time in study, and all transfer students must anticipate meeting the total performance requirements for the B.A. degree, students deficient in level of perfor\u00ad mance in comparison to their level of academic study should be prepared to extend their studies in order to meet perfor\u00ad mance requirements.

Admission Applicants for admission to the degree program must meet the general requirements for admission to graduate study and hold a B.A. or B.F.A. in Dance. Candidates must meet the minimum requirements for the B.A. degree in Dance from the Irvine campus of the University of California. A paper of 500 words or more on a dance subject and proposals for three choreographed works which could be completed in the graduate program must be submitted for the file. Proof of practical ability in ballet, modern, and jazz dance forms must be provided by personal audition on the announced date shortly following the March 1 deadline for applying. Also on this date, applicants must present a prepared five-minute choreographed piece: a solo performed by the applicant and/or a work for a small group. Interviews with faculty will be conducted following the audition. General Degree Requirements Normally two years of residence are required. Each candidate must enroll for three courses each quarter for six quarters, ex\\=lusive of summer sessions. Normally after three quarters in residence, students must demonstrate satisfactory progress by the presentation of a choreographic project. Acceptable completion of this project will allow the student to progress to candidacy for the degree. The project is to be defended in a supporting paper of about 20 pages. Satisfactory attainment must be demonstrated by a major production thesis: in choreography this would be the compo\u00ad sition and production of a choreographic work; in teaching this would be a practical and comprehensive project con\u00ad cerned with the teaching of dance. The production or project and supporting paper are to be defended in a one-hour oral Dance 93 examination which may also test the candidate's general knowledge in the area and a written thesis in a chosen area of research must be prepared. This thesis is to be defended in a one-hour oral examination which may also test the candi\u00ad date's general knowledge in the area.

Each major in drama experiences exacting and rigorous training in the mutually interrelated areas of the theatre: performance, design, literature, history, and criticism. The curriculum con\u00ad stantly relates studio practices, technical resources, and pro\u00ad ductional techniques to the development of dramatic litera\u00ad ture and current critical theory. The student specializes dur\u00ad ing the last two years of study in acting, directing, design, television, or criticism. The continuous production of plays, musicals, operettas, and operas constitutes the major activity of the program. Stu\u00ad dents are treated as members of a theatrical organization, and they acquire experiences in all phases of theatrical pro\u00ad duction in a professionally disciplined atmosphere. Dramatic production centers on an exhaustive analysis of the script and on the challenge of communicating the complexities of the plan to an audience in a unified and meaningful production. The program is designed for students preparing to continue professionally as actors, directors, designers, critics, and teachers, as well as for students who, while not planning to make the theatre their vocation, have a serious interest in the literature, theory, and practice of drama. Careers for the Drama Major A degree in Drama may or may not lead to professional employment in theatre or films. A professional career in act\u00ad ing demands, in addition to excellent training, great talent, great dedication, and not a little bit of luck: intangibles no drama program can promise or even imply. Graduates in Drama at UCI have performed in Broadway plays, regional and summer theatres, and in films and televi\u00ad sion. At least seven thriving repertory theatres in the coun\u00ad try have been created by UCI Drama graduates; all of these theatres regularly add new members from the UCI alumni. Not all Drama students become professional theatre artists. Many embark upon careers in law, business, arts manage\u00ad ment, advertising, and teaching; others pursue further study earning the Master of Fine Arts degree at Irvine or elsewhere. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 12. School Requirements: None. Program Requirements One year survey in the development of dramatic literature (Drama 40A-B-C); one year in acting (Drama 30A-B-C); three courses in design (Drama SOA-B-C); one course in makeup (Drama 153); an introductory course in production theory (Drama 10); two upper-division courses in dramatic literature; six upper-division courses in addition to the two in dramatic literature mentioned above (these may be in studio work and/or dramatic literature, playwriting, film writing, television production, and criticism); two quarters in dance (these courses may be taken on Pass/Not Pass); two quarters of theatre production (Drama 101).

By March I applicants must submit dossiers of biographical information and theatrical experience, together with photo\u00ad graphs, essays, reviews, production books, and portfolios, as appropriate. Normally an audition is required for all applicants who intend to follow the curriculum in acting or music theatre; auditions are scheduled at UCI and in New York City shortly after the application deadline. Interviews for applicants in directing are also required; for applicants in design, interviews are strongly recommended. UC IRVINE - 1982-198396 Drama General Degree Requirements Normally three years of residence is required. Each candidate must enroll for three courses each quarter for nine quarters, exclusive of summer sessions. During the first year of residence each candidate will prepare, for credit, two graduate projects, in either acting, directing, design, theatrical research, or a combination of two of these. Satisfactory completion of these projects, as determined by the faculty, is prerequisite to entering the second year of the program. During the second year of the program the candidate will be examined on general familiarity with the history of the thea\u00ad tre and the principal works of dramatic literature. An assigned list of books and plays will form the basic syllabus of this examination. The required thesis normally consists of directing, designing, or playing a principal role in a major production, and collect\u00ad ing in essay form the evidences of research, analysis, and judgments which formed a part of the production experience. Each graduate student is expected to participate in produc\u00ad tions throughout residence at UCI.

Many graduates do, however, become professional musicians. Other former stu\u00ad dents are successful freelancing composers and performers. Many others go on to pursue graduate degrees in perfor\u00ad mance, music history, conducting, arts management, music librarianship, composition, or secondary or postsecondary education. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 12. School Requirements: None. Program Requirements (General) Entering majors are expected to have competence in the prac\u00ad tice of music: in reading and performing. At the end of the sophomore year, the faculty will determine whether the stu\u00ad dent is making sufficient progress in the following areas to proceed as an upper-division major: 1. Basic Ability at the Keyboard: the performance at sight of moderately difficult works; 2. Musicianship: sightsinging, dictation, keyboard harmony; 3. Analysis: music of the difficulty of a Mozart divertimento (from score), a sonata movement by Beethoven, a Schubert song; and 4. History: knowledge of basic reference tools for all Western music, major composers, major musical styles and forms ca. 500-1950. All transfer students must take placement examinations in the four areas specified above and must audition. Evaluations of auditions and examinations will indicate whether or not the student may declare a major in music and will indicate the appropriate placement level for students admitted to the major. This placement level determines the minimum amount of years it will take to complete the degree requirements. Basic to the program for all majors is command of piano: the performance at sight of moderately difficult works. Students must demonstrate this skill, by examination, no later than the end of the first quarter of the junior year. Performance requirements include private study -vocal or instrumental, a senior recital, and participation in the chorus or various music ensembles during each quarter of the stu\u00ad dent's four years.

Bailes Dean The School of Humanities sets for itself the goal of helping to develop both the analytical and creative powers of its stu\u00ad dents with particular respect not only to vocational goals, but also the larger questions of human conduct, the modes of human communication and symbolization, speculative thought, and the verbal arts. The School includes those basic disciplines of language, literature, history, and philosophy that deal fundamentally with the relation of man to himself and to all that is other than himself. As such, the School takes as its concern a large portion of the liberal education not only of students who intend to major within its confines, but also of students who come to it from other parts of the campus. Because of the nature of the disciplines collected in the School, it is deeply concerned with language and its many facets. Further, though the School has established a number of specific major courses of study, it is intent on integrating the basic disciplines in a variety of ways at the undergraduate level and to some extent at the graduate level.

To be nomi\u00ad nated the student must achieve a UC grade point average of at least 3.40 and receive strong recommendation from the department. A minimum of 18 courses (72 units) in residence at a UC campus is a necessary condition for honors at grad\u00ad uation. To be eligible for nomination, the student must meet all honors criteria and must file an application for graduation by the end of the winter quarter of the senior year. UNDERGRADUATEPROG~S The School offers undergraduate majors in Classical Civiliza\u00ad tion, Classics, Comparative Literature, English, French, Ger\u00ad man, History, Humanities, Linguistics, Philosophy, Russian, and Spanish. It offers elementary and intermediate courses in Hebrew and elementary and upper-division courses in Italian and Portuguese. A corps of lower-division advisors is designed to meet the special needs of freshmen and sophomores. The advisors are particularly interested in undergraduate education and espe\u00ad cially knowledgeable about University regulations, require\u00ad ments in and outside the School, course content, options to major, and other matters that may present difficulties. For the first two years, students in Humanities are encouraged to explore the various disciplines represented in the School. During that time the lower-division advisor is prepared to help the student keep options to major open, plan a coherent program of humanistic study, and reach an eventual decision about the major. NOTE: In many undergraduate courses in the School of Humanities, additional meetings between individual students and the instructor may be required. Generally each major stipulates a one-year course that is both an introduction to the discipline and a prerequisite to the major itself. Students who plan wisely with their advisors will construct programs that include a good number of such courses. Undergraduate students in the School of Humanities partici\u00ad pate in the affairs of the School in a number of ways: by serv\u00ad ing on committees of various departments, by sitting with the faculty in its meetings, and by serving on the Humanities Council, which directly advises the Dean. Graduates of the School of Humanities often go on to gradu\u00ad ate and professional schools. An undergraduate major in the humanities is excellent preparation for future careers in law, teaching at all levels, business, journalism, administration, government service at all levels, and also medicine. Language Laboratory The Language Laboratory serves as the audio-lingual re\u00ad source center for the following languages taught in the School of Humanities: Spanish, French, German, Russian, Portuguese, Italian, and Hebrew. Students, faculty, and staff may listen to cassettes of audio material in the Laboratory, or they may check out cassettes and cassette players to practice at home. Members of the community are welcome to use the Language Laboratory facilities on campus. In addition to the languages offered in the School of Humani\u00ad ties, the Language Laboratory has a tape library that includes reels in Persian, Romanian, Chinese, Japanese, Dutch, Swed\u00ad ish, Norwegian, English, and Swahili. Arrangements can be made to provide these languages on cassette. Through the business office, the Language Laboratory oper\u00ad ates a translation referral service for students, faculty, staff, members of the community, and local businesses. The Lan\u00ad guage Laboratory is located in 207 and 213 Humanities Hall and is open from 8:00a.m. until 4:00p.m., Monday through Friday. The telephone number is (714) 833-6344. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 12. School Requirements Humanities 1A-B-C, taken in the freshman year (transfer students may substitute appropriate course work in composi\u00ad tion, literature, history, humanities, and philosophy for the Core Course by permission: apply in the Dean's Office); two years of work in a single acceptable foreign language, either modern or classical (through 2C), or equivalent competence; quarterly consultation with an assigned !ower-division ad\u00ad visor and the advisor's written approval for the program of study decided upon. Consultation should be made by the second week of each quarter. Graduate Programs The School offers a wide program of graduate degrees. Although the Master's degree is offered in most depart\u00ad ments, the programs emphasize the Ph.D. and give distinct preference in admission to those students who intend to take that degree. An exception is the two-year Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing). In addition to the sem\u00ad inars offered by the various departments, the School spon\u00ad sors a number of interdisciplinary seminars annually. These courses are taught jointly by faculty members from various departments. Further, several departments offer a few stu\u00ad dents the opportunity to do part of their work for the Ph.D. in a related discipline. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Humanities 107 UC IRVINE - 1982-1983108 Classics A limited number of students is accepted annually to study for teaching credentials. This program is a cooperative effort between the School and the Office of Teacher Education. Graduate students in the School of Humanities participate in the affairs of the School in a number of ways: by serving on committees of the various departments, by sitting with the faculty in its meetings, and by serving on the student gradu\u00ad ate advisory committee, which directly advises the Dean. DEPARTMENT OF CLASSICS B.P. Reardon, D.U. Universite de Nantes, Chair of the Department and Professor of Classics (Late Greek literature, Greek novel) Luci Berkowitz, Ph.D. The Ohio State University, Professor of Classics (pastoral poetry, literary criticism) Theodore F. Brunner, Ph.D. Stanford University, Professor of Classics and Director, Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project (computer applica\u00ad tion to classical literature, Augustan literature) Peter Colaclides, Ph.D. University of Athens, Professor of Classics (linguistics, poetics, criticism) Richard I. Frank, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Associate Professor of Classics and History (Roman history, Classical tradition) Dana F. Sutton, Ph.D. University of Wisconsin, Associate Professor of Classics (Greek drama, satyr-play) UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The Department of Classics aims to provide the undergradu\u00ad ate student with an exposure to the origins and heritage of Western civilization. The Department is committed to a two\u00ad fold purpose: (1) disseminating interest in and knowledge of classical civilization through the teaching of Greek and Latin language and literature; and (2), through English translation courses in classical literature, history, civilization, and mythology, helping students to appreciate the pervasive influence of Greece and Rome on our own civilization. The Department offers both a major in Classics with an emphasis on Greek, Latin, or Linguistics and a major in Classical Civili\u00ad zation in which most of the required courses are in English translation. Students are encouraged to consult with the Classics faculty regarding the appropriate choice of major and design of program. For the Classics major, the basis of studying the Classics must be competence in both of the classical languages. The Classics program is designed to provide the student with this competence as rapidly as possible, so that by the end of first year Latin or Greek the student has already been introduced to some of the major classical authors in the original. From then -on, the student is concerned with reading and interpret\u00ad ing the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, and will devote study to literary and textual criticism. In addition, students obtain an extensive background in ancillary fields such as ancient history, archaeology, art, drama, philosophy, and religion. The major in Classical Civilization is designed for those stu\u00ad dents who have no plans to pursue graduate studies in the classical languages, yet wish to obtain an undergraduate degree based on a sound exposure to the classical world. The nucleus of this major consists of one year of study (or its equivalent) in either classical language and a minimum of 10 courses in English translation (seven of which are given by the Department) concerning such topics as classical literature, civilization, history, archaeology, art, and drama. The student planning to major in Classics or Classical Civili\u00ad zation should obtain a copy of the pamphlet, \"The Classics,\" available in the departmental office. Students entering UCI with previous Greek or Latin training will be given advanced standing as follows: In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, and four years of high school Latin will enroll in Latin 18, 1C, 25, and 100 respectively. Exceptions to this ruling can be made but must have the approval of the Department Chair. Students with high school training in the classical languages are encouraged to consult with the Classics staff before enrolling in Classics courses. The Department adheres to the policy of giving its students an opportunity to participate in the departmental decision\u00ad making process. Student representatives, elected from and by the undergraduate majors, participate in all departmental meetings. They are responsible for maintaining close liaison with their constituency, for representing the students' inter\u00ad est in curriculum and personnel matters, and for the evalua\u00ad tion of both the academic program and the academic staff. Please direct inquiries regarding language placement, prereq\u00ad uisites, planning a program of study, or other matters related to the Department's offerings to the Office of the Chair, 142 Humanities Hall, (714) 833-6735/5896. Hebrew and Judaic Studies Courses in Hebrew and Judaic Studies were initiated by the Department of Classics in September 1976, through a joint agreement between the School of Humanities and the Uni\u00ad versity of Judaism in Los Angeles. Normally two years of Hebrew are offered which meet the Humanities foreign lan\u00ad guage requirement. Emphasis is on modern Israeli-spoken Hebrew, with some instruction in Biblical Hebrew during the second year. Hebrew language courses will not be offered in 1982-83 but may be resumed in 1983-84. Courses will con\u00ad tinue to be offered in aspects of Jewish history, philosophy, and literature (Classics 180A-B-C, 181, and 182A-B-C). Through this program the Department of Classics is able to broaden its offerings to include both the Greek and Hebrew contributions to Western civilization. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 12. School Requirements: See page 106. Departmental Requirements Two separate majors: Classics (with an emphasis in Greek, Latin, or Linguistics) and Classical Civilization. Classics (Greek emphasis): five or more courses on the Greek 100 level; Greek 110; Latin 1A-B-C; Latin 25; two courses on the Latin 100 level. Classics (Latin emphasis): five or more courses on the Latin 100 level; Latin 110; Greek 1A-B-C; Greek 25; two courses on the Greek 100 level. Classics (Linguistics emphasis): two possible plans of study. Greek concentration-Greek 25; five courses on the Greek 100 level; Greek 110; Latin 25; two courses on the Latin 100 level; Linguistics 50, 110, 120, 130 (Greek 120 recommended) or Latin concentration-Latin 25; five courses on the Latin 100 level; Latin 110; Greek 25; two courses on the Greek 100 level; Linguistics 50, 110, 120, 130 (Latin 120 recommended). NOTE: With the permission of the Department, an additional 100 series course in the same language may be substituted for Greek or Latin 25. Classical Civilization: Latin (or Greek) 1A-B-C, or equiva\u00ad lent; Classics 35A-B-C; Classics 50A; at least one course each from the Classics 150, 160, and 170 series; three additional courses in classical history, classical philosophy, classical art, or classical civilization approved by the Classics Department. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Planning a Program of Study The Department believes in close consultation with students on academic advising, program planning, and discussion of goals and direction. Students planning to major in Classics or Classical Civilization are strongly urged to consult with the departmental faculty at the earliest possible moment, in order to familiarize themselves with the nature of the various pro\u00ad grams. All majors are assigned to a faculty member for aca\u00ad demic advising. Career Opportunities The practical value of the study of the ancient world extends very distinctly into modern life. The discipline of Classics is primarily a valuable component of a liberal education; a knowledge of Greek and Roman language and literature, his\u00ad tory and philosophy, religion and mythology offers an excel\u00ad lent foundation for the investigation and appreciation of many aspects of modern civilization; in effect, it is an inter\u00ad disciplinary study. For this reason, the student who chooses to major in Classics or Classical Civilization may find many professional opportunities open. Graduate and professional schools in law, medicine, management, and other fields wel\u00ad come students with training in the Classics. So do many bus\u00ad iness corporations. In a world of rapid industrial develop\u00ad ment, in which highly specialized skills quickly become obso\u00ad lete because of changes in technology, many enterprises find it necessary to train prospective executives themselves, to suit their own needs. Businesses are well acquainted with the value of a classical training; they are aware that a student with a strong background in a respected and demanding major such as Classics has been trained in disciplined think\u00ad ing, ability to learn, and the ability to express oneself in clear, coherent, and cogent language, capabilities which they find valuable in a future manager. There are also specific vocational opportunities open to the graduate in Classics or Classical Civilization. Most imme\u00ad diately, a major in this field may lead to a career in high school teaching, or (after appropriate further study) in college or university teaching. It is also an excellent preparation for advanced study in other academic disciplines, such as archaeology, history, comparative literature, and linguistics, as well as for theological studies and for work in a wide range of humanities and social science subjects. GRADUATE PROGRAM The Classics graduate program emphasizes individual atten\u00ad tion under tutorial conditions and study in small groups. The number of students admitted is carefully limited and work is closely supervised. Each student is associated with various faculty members while developing general competence in the discipline, research methods, and teaching. The principal strength of the program is in the area of literature. The entering student should be qualified at least to the level of the B.A. in Classics; some students may be required to do additional work at the undergraduate level. Students entering with the B.A. are normally expected to complete the Ph.D. program in five years. Completion of a dissertation and its successful oral defense are required. A sample Ph.D. curriculum can be obtained on request from the Department. The M.A. degree may be conferred after two years of satisfactory work. Students meet in one group for regular course work consist\u00ad ing of three elements as follows: (1) a single weekly seminar, covering a different topic each quarter, which may meet on another UC campus in some quarters; most seminars are devoted to major literary topics; Cia ssics 109 (2) a topically arranged directed reading course covering, in a three-year cycle, texts on the reading list; (3) tutorial instruction in Greek and Latin language and advanced prose composition. In addition to the above, instruction is given regularly in the tradition, methods, and tools of classical scholarship, includ\u00ad ing computer application to literature. In addition to course work, students are required to read extensively in the general field of Classics, under faculty guidance. Students take written examinations, and their progress is assessed periodically. Students are required to pass reading examinations in German and French at an early stage. After course work is completed, each student must pass an individ\u00ad ually designed qualifying examination, covering both the general field of Classics and the student's own interests, in order to become a candidate for the Ph.D. and enter the dis\u00ad sertation stage. The resources of the program are appreciably enhanced by contributions from other sources. In particular, cooperative arrangements are in force among the Classics graduate pro\u00ad grams of the UC campuses at Irvine, Los Angeles, and Santa Barbara. Additionally, the program calls on visiting scholars, faculty from other UCI departments, and members of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project (see below). THESAURUS LINGUAE GRAECAE PROJEO The Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project, a unique resource for research in Greek literary and linguistic studies, is closely affiliated with the Department of Classics.

University of Iowa, Professor of English (modern and contemporary poetry, poetry writing) The Department of English and Comparative Literature is concerned with the nature and value of literature, possible approaches to literary works, and the relation of literary criti\u00ad cism to the intellectual issues of the day. Fundamentally it is concerned with the humanistic problem of value. Thus its main literary concern is critical and theoretical. Though not alone in the task, the Department recognizes a continuing obligation to help all students write the English language with clarity and grace. Students are given the opportunity to participate in depart\u00ad n:tental affairs through two elected student committees, one of undergraduates, one of graduates, which are concerned primarily with matters of personnel and curriculum. The committees meet periodically with faculty committees of the Department, and the recommendations of student commit\u00ad tees become matters of record which accompany any recom\u00ad mendations emanating from the Department. Each quarter all students taking classes within the Department have the opportunity to evaluate the particular course and teacher. Careers for the English or Comparative Literature Major The study of literature helps students to express their ideas clearly, do independent research, and think analytically and imaginatively. These capabilities will help qualify majors for careers in education, law, technical writing, communications, journalism, public relations, business, and management. Because the undergraduate programs in English and Com\u00ad parative Literature are modeled according to the Depart\u00ad ment's graduate programs, an undergraduate major in either discipline is especially good preparation for graduate study. The Undergraduate Majors Committee and the departmental faculty work closely with the Career Planning and Placement Center to help majors plan careers appropriate to the educa\u00ad tion in English or Comparative Literature at Irvine. Advisors encourage their students to investigate various careers\u00ad especially those outside the traditional fields for such majors (e.g., gr<Iduate study and law)-before these students have completed their undergraduate educations. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The Department offers to the undergraduate three areas of study: The Program in Literary Criticism, which emphasizes a vari\u00ad ety of critical approaches in the reading and criticism of Eng\u00ad lish, American, and comparative literature. The Program in Writing, which offers an emphasis in the writing of poetry, fiction, or drama. Undergraduate courses in journalism and nonfiction are also available, including for\u00ad mal instruction and workshop experience for staff members of the campus newspaper. The aim of the program is to UC IRVINE - 1982-1983112 English and Comparative Literature encourage the creative powers of students while introducing them to the discipline of reading and practical criticism, often in workshop situations. Under certain circumstances, creative writing courses may satisfy part of the writing requirement portion of the UCI breadth requirement (Category I). See page 13. The Program in Comparative Literature, which though administratively a part of the Department, is basically inter\u00ad disciplinary in its orientation, drawing on faculty and other resources from the fields of the various modern and classical literatures and drama. The consciousness of the modern edu\u00ad cated person is the product of centuries of cultural heritage, including not only works of literature in one's own language but world literature from Homer to Gide and Thomas Mann. At UCI, Comparative Literature is regarded as the study of literature from the international point of view rather than in a national framework. A student who completes a degree in Comparative Literature will be expected to have a grasp of the history of literature in its broad outlines and to be able to deal competently with literary texts, whatever their period or national origins. Since the Department believes that a student of literature should recognize the importance of understanding theoretical problems in literature, of developing a broad acquaintance with literary texts, and of experiencing the problems of liter\u00ad ary creation at first hand, the Department invites students to take work in all three of its programs, with an emphasis in one of the first two (toward a Bachelor's degree in English) or a major in the third (toward a Bachelor's degree in Compara\u00ad tive Literature). Many of the courses will vary in specific content from year to year, depending on the plans of individual teachers, since the Department recognizes that no course can treat all the major authors and works relevant to a given period or topic. Students intending to major in English or Comparative Liter\u00ad ature should obtain a copy of Undergraduate Study in English and Comparative Literature from the departmental office. Comparative Literature is well-suited for students interested in a double major. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 12. School Requirements: See page 106. Departmental Requirements English: Two courses from theE 28A-B-C or CL SOA-B-C groups (including either E 28A or CL SOA) and a third course either from those two groups or from E 6, 7, 8 or CL 8; CR 100A; CR 100B and CL 100 (approved seminars from the course groups numbered in the 103s and 104s may be substi\u00ad tuted for these courses); at least four courses from the E 101 group; at least five Department courses numbered above ~ 101; competence in a foreign language, either classical or modern, equivalent to six quarters of work at Irvine (in clas\u00ad sical languages, 1A-B-C and Greek or Latin 100 three times, though Greek or Latin 25 may be substituted for one of the 100 courses), plus (in modern languages) one course in a for\u00ad eign literature in which texts are read in the original lan\u00ad guage. Students selecting a writing emphasis have some flex\u00ad ibility in substituting writing workshops for period and genre courses; their total courses normally number more than the usual major. Those students planning to graduate during 1982-83 will fol\u00ad low the former major requirements (see the 1981-82 General Catalogue) and must consult their advisors. The exception to the old requirements is that appropriate sections of E 101 will be substituted forE 102A-B-C. Comparative Literature: Sufficient competence in a foreign language, either modern or classical, to be able to read any standard literary or critical text in that language. If the stu\u00ad dent intends to continue with graduate work, the study of a second foreign language is highly recommended before graduation. Three quarters of lower-division work: Comparative Litera\u00ad ture majors are normally required to take CL SOA-B-C. Transfer students may be required to take one or more courses in the sequence depending on the courses they have taken previously. Normally 10 upper-division courses in addition: usually these will include CR 100A-B, CL 100, CL 102A-B (required) and either E 103 or CL 103 or CL 104; suitable upper-division course work in the literature of a foreign language; appro\u00ad priate study in English and American literature; and further study in literature or allied fields as recommended by the advisor. The Comparative Literature Program maintains a compre\u00ad hensive reading list in world literature, on which CL SOA-B\u00ad C and CL 102A-B are based. \u00b7Students who have not taken and passed one or more of those courses may, by prior arrange\u00ad ment with the Director of the Program, take an examination on relevant parts of the reading list in qualifying for a Bachelor's degree in Comparative Literature. Planning a Program of Study Students should plan, with their faculty advisors, coherent programs of study, including undergraduate seminars, work\u00ad shops in writing (for students choosing a writing emphasis), and courses in allied areas outside the Department. It is pos\u00ad sible to combine a cluster of courses in literature with other majors in the sciences and social sciences, and to use an Eng\u00ad lish or Comparative Literature major as preprofessional train\u00ad ing in government, law, medicine, etc. Students who wish advice in planning such programs should consult both the Department and people in their prospective professional areas. Students who intend to pursue a single subject or multiple subject teaching credential must consult with Professor Myron Simon (as well as with the Office of Teacher Educa\u00ad tion) to ensure that they understand the departmental and State requirements. A student who intends to continue with graduate work is urged to study a second foreign language before graduation. GRADUATE PROGRAM The Department's three principal areas of work on the un\u00ad dergraduate level-English and American Literature, Com\u00ad parative Literature, and the English major with writing emphasis-are reflected in the graduate programs: the M.A. and Ph.D. in English, the M.A. and Ph.D. in Comparative Literature, and the M.F.A. in English (Creative Writing). A student's courses for the M.A. and Ph.D. in English may include or emphasize work in American literature as well; and the faculty is particularly equipped to guide students with special interests in criticism and theory, an area which candidates for the Ph.D. in English or in Comparative Litera\u00ad ture may stress in their qualifying examinations and disserta- UC IRVINE - 1982-1983tions. Ordinarily students are not admitted to the English or Comparative Literature programs unless they plan to con\u00ad tinue, and are qualified to continue, to the degree of Ph.D. Students are admitted to the M.F.A. program chiefly on the basis of submitted creative work. A committee of the Department, with the consent of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, admits students to these programs. Each program has a director appointed by the Department Chair. A deliberate effort is made to maintain close adminis\u00ad trative and intellectual ties among the programs. Specific requirements for the graduate degrees will be reached by consultation between members of the faculty and the candidate. The first-year graduate student or the candi\u00ad date for the Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing) plans a program with an assigned advisor; candidates for the Ph.D. plan with an advisor and three-person committee. At the time of the M.A. examination, the Graduate Committee evaluates the student's graduate career up to that point and offers advice about future prospects. Candidates for literary degrees are encouraged to study philosophy, history, foreign languages and literatures, and the fine arts. Applicants for graduate degrees in English and Comparative Literature must submit scores for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) including the Advanced Literature in English Test; applicants must also submit sample papers and a statement about competence in foreign languages. Only in exceptional circumstances will students be permitted to undertake programs of less than six full courses during the academic year. The normal expectation, however, is enroll\u00ad ment in three courses each quarter, except for Teaching Assistants, who take two courses in addition to earning credit for University teaching. Students who are not teaching should be able to complete course work in two years, plus a quarter or a summer in preparation for the M.A. examina\u00ad tion, which normally is taken after about nine courses. The Ph.D. qualifying examination should be taken within a couple of quarters after courses are finished. Dissertations can fre\u00ad quently be written in a year. The Ph.D. in English normally should be completed in five years or less; the Ph.D. in Com\u00ad parative Literature normally should be completed in six years or less. The Department recognizes that many of its graduate stu\u00ad dents intend to become teachers, and it believes that graduate departments should be training college teachers as well as scholars-indeed, that teaching and most literary scholarship complement one another. Thus the Department has initiated a program by which all its Ph.D. candidates, in English as well as in Comparative Literature, may gain supervised training as part of the formal seminar work required for the degree. M.F.A. candidates also have the opportunity to participate in this program. All those interested in graduate study in the Department should obtain the brochure on graduate programs from the departmental office. English Master of Arts in English Each candidate for the M.A. will be assigned to a graduate advisor who will supervise the student's program. The M.A. plan of study includes (I) the completion of course work, as advised, for three quarters or the equivalent; (2) demon\u00ad strated proficiency in reading a designated foreign language, modern or classical; and (3) the passing of a written examina\u00ad tion upon a designated reading list. Exceptional students may be exempted from taking the examination by petitioning the Graduate Committee, which will review the student's per-English and Comparative Literature 113 UC IRVINE - 1982-1983114 English and Comparative Literature formance and qualifications in arriving at its decision. The candidate must take all formal work in graduate-level courses and seminars. Master of Fine Arts in English The Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) is a degree in creative writing. The M.F.A. degree is normally conferred upon the comple\u00ad tion of a two-year residence. Each quarter the candidate will be enrolled in either the poetry or fiction section of the Graduate Writers' Workshop, which will constitute two\u00ad thirds of a course load, the other course to be selected in con\u00ad sultation with the student's advisor. It is expected that M.F.A. candidates will complete at least one supervised teach\u00ad ing seminar. In addition to course work, the candidate is required to pass an examination on a reading list of literary works in the genre selected, and to present as a thesis an acceptable book\u00ad length manuscript of poetry or short stories, or a novel. Doctor of Philosophy in English The program for the Ph.D. in English requires about two years of full-time enrollment in regular courses beyond the B.A. (two courses of which may be in the graduate teaching program); proficiency in the reading of two acceptable for\u00ad eign languages, modern or classical; the dissertation; and satisfactory performance on designated examinations. The languages acceptable depend upon the nature of the stu\u00ad dent's program as determined by the student's advisors. Reading competence in one of these languages must be estab\u00ad lished in the first year of residence, and competence in the second well before the general examination. Students admitted at the post-M.A. level must provide evi\u00ad dence of satisfactory competence in foreign languages. Com\u00ad petence in one of the two languages required for the Ph.D. is verified through a course in theory and practice of transla\u00ad tion; the other language may be verified through examination. Upon completion of course work the student takes general examinations on literary theory and criticism; some particular literary form, genre, style, theme, or structure; a historical period; a group of authors; and a specific topic. The first four of these examinations are written; the fifth is oral. The stu\u00ad dent has the opportunity to present personal choices for the examination, but the choices must enable an individual to demonstrate breadth of knowledge as well as literary under\u00ad standing and therefore must be approved by the advisory committee. Upon satisfactorily completing the general examination and the oral Qualifying Examination, the student is admitted to candidacy for the degree. As soon after completion of the general examination as is practical, the student presents an essay leading to dissertation for the approval of the doctoral committee. Submission of an acceptable dissertation com\u00ad pletes the Ph.D. All work for the Ph.D. degree must be in courses limited to graduate students. Comparative Literature There are at least four avenues by which the student may approach graduate work in Comparative Literature: I. An undergraduate major in Comparative Literature equiv\u00ad alent to the one described above; 2. An English major, provided that a sufficient background in at least one foreign language is demonstrated (a beginning on a second foreign language is desirable); 3. A normal major in drama, with same proviso as 1 above; 4. A normal major in a foreign language, provided that a suf\u00ad ficient general background in world literature is demonstrated. Make-up work will be required before graduate studies can begin if one of these avenues has not been taken. At the graduate level, the study of Comparative Literature becomes more specialized, with the student engaged in a par\u00ad ticular area of research and concerned with such problems as the development of genres, interrelations between litera\u00ad tures, the theory and practice of translation, and other liter\u00ad ary questions transcending national boundaries. For the graduate student in Comparative Literature a profes\u00ad sional competence in foreign languages is essential. French and German are usually required for all doctoral candidates, since these languages along with English are the accepted tools of international literary scholarship. A classical language may prove indispensable for work in many traditional fields of literary study, and the scholar's own specialty may require the mastery of other languages. The underlying assumption of language requirements is that, after the tool languages have been mastered, the professional scholar's own interests should determine the specific kinds and degrees of language skill to be acquired. At the graduate level, the nucleus of the foreign language re\u00ad quirement is the course CL 220 (Problems in Translation) in which, after a suitable theoretical preparation, the student plans and carries out a high-quality translation of a literary text. The translation, along with an introduction or other scholarly apparatus explaining and defending the technical decisions involved in the task, is then submitted as a paper for course credit. Master of Arts in Comparative Literature Students entering the Master of Arts program should com\u00ad plete their course work in three quarters. This course work should include CL 220 (Problems in Translation) with a proj\u00ad ect in either French or German and appropriate graduate\u00ad level work in English, foreign languages, drama, comparative literature, and other areas as recommended by the advisor. . Soon after beginning graduate work the student, with the advice and approval of the assigned advisor, will decide on a field of specialty, which will be emphasized in progressing toward the M.A. degree. (Normally this choice will be a pre\u00ad liminary step toward the selection of an area of specialty for the Ph.D.) Graduate study in Comparative Literature requires an excep\u00ad tional facility in foreign languages, and the student should not attempt a Master's degree without a thorough knowl\u00ad edge of one foreign language and literature and a considera\u00ad ble knowledge of a second language. Normally the greatest part of the student's work will involve the study of literary texts in the original languages. At the end of course work, normally about nine courses at the graduate level, the student will be examined on a reading list in world literature that the student's committee has approved. This list should be designed by the student in con\u00ad sultation with the committee and based on the general World Literature list for Comparative Literature. The student's own list should follow some organizing principle, such as an emphasis on the fields and languages of the student's special\u00ad ization. Nevertheless, every list should include works from all of the different groups represented on the general World Literature list. The M.A. examination is a three-hour written examination, which focuses on essay questions based on the student's approved reading list. Exceptional students may be UC IRVINE - 1982-1983exempted from taking the examination by petitioning the Graduate Committee, which will review the student's per\u00ad formance and qualifications in arriving at its decision. Doctor of Philosophy in Comparative Literature The Doctoral program is designed to prepare the student for a professional career as a scholar and critic of literature. Details of the doctoral program in Comparative Literature may be obtained from the Director. Normally the degree requires two years of course work (usually a minimum of three courses per quarter). Of these courses, the only required course is CL 220 (Problems in Translation), which is taken twice, with projects in acceptable languages. The rest of the student's work will be in seminars or other graduate\u00ad level courses in Comparative Literature, English, the various foreign language departments, or drama. In general an exceptional command of foreign languages is required, normally involving a professional competence in two or more foreign languages, either modern or classical. The doctoral student is encouraged to design and carry out a personal plan of study (the area of specialty) in a particular field of interest. The requirements for the doctorate also include an area of competence in literary theory and practical criticism; a student may also stress theory in preparation for the Qualifying Examination. Upon completion of the course work, the student will be examined in the following areas of knowledge: (I) mastery of a limited topic in literary theory or history of criticism, along with general knowledge of major critical texts in the history of literature; (2) an area of specialty as described above; and (3) major works and authors appropriate to the study of comparative literature. Following this examination, and upon recommendation of a candidacy committee appointed by the Graduate Council, the student is formally admitted to candidacy. The study toward the degree of Doctor of Philosophy will culminate in the writing of a suitable dissertation, normally on a comparative subject, although subjects lying within a single literature or dealing with general literary and aesthetic problems not confined to any specific literatures may also be acceptable. Studies of the relation between literature and the other arts are also encouraged. UNDERGRADUATE COURSES Satisfaction of the Subject A requirement is a prerequisite for all departmental courses except E 6, 7, 8 and CL 8.

It seeks to enrich the students' appreciation of their own civilizations and to create a deeper sense of international understanding. The program brings the students to participate in the crea\u00ad tive process of language, to think in French or Italian as they learn to understand, speak, read, and write. Most classes are taught entirely in the foreign language, and a multiple approach stresses the interdependence of the four basic skills and makes them mutually reinforcing. The Language Labora\u00ad tory is used to complement classroom activity. Representatives chosen by the undergraduate French majors and by the graduate students serve on departmental commit\u00ad tees. These representatives also participate in Department meetings and are responsible for student evaluation procedures. Careers for the French Major The great majority of students who major in French pursue careers in various sectors of the world of business and com\u00ad merce, where they can take advantage not only of their com\u00ad petency in communicating in French but also of their knowl\u00ad edge of French literature and civilization. They gain an inter\u00ad national perspective which provides them with a dearer pic\u00ad ture of their own cultural heritage. In practical terms, this perspective will allow them to operate efficiently in market\u00ad ing, publicity, and public relations, where sophistication has become essential. A number of students also follow careers in education, continue their studies in graduate school, or enter the diplomatic service. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM IN FRENCH ) While preparing the student for graduate work and for the teaching profession, the French major is essentially a liberal arts program offering a broad, humanistic course of study. At the intermediate lower-division level, texts of contempor\u00ad ary literary and social interest provide the focus for advanced conversation, reading, and composition. After the second year, courses in speaking (conversation and phonetics) and writing enable the students to attain a greater degree of proficiency, preparing them for further study in French literature and linguistics and in French civilization and culture. In the introductory courses in literature, complete texts are studied by genre. The student learns to analyze and interpret different types of creative literature and is introduced to various critical techniques. At the more advanced level, litera\u00ad ture courses may emphasize a single author, movement, or genre within a historical period. The content of these courses changes yearly according to the interests of both faculty and students. Senior seminars are offered periodically to discuss literary problems which cannot be dealt with in depth in the regular offerings. Courses in civilization and culture explore aspects of French history, intellectual thought, and the arts. Courses are offered with a historical emphasis (for instance, the world of the Renaissance in France; the Age of Louis XIV; colonialism; anti-Semitism) and with a comparative orientation (for instance, poetry and painting; literature and society; women in literature; Paris and the history of art; literature and history). Courses in linguistics introduce students to aspects of the structure of the French language and to the application of linguistic techniques to problems of literary analysis. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983118 French and Italian Students are placed in elementary and intermediate courses according to their years of previous study and their grades; no placement examination is given. One year of high school is equated with one quarter of work at UCI. A student may not go back more than one quarter and receive credit. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 12. School Requirements: See page 106. Departmental Requirements French Major with Emphasis in Literature: French 11, IOOA-B, IOIA-B-C and eight other upper-division courses taught in French, at least six of which must be in literature. French Major with Emphasis in Linguistics: French 11, IOOA-B, IOIA-B-C, two courses in French civilization, Linguistics 50, 110, 120, 130, and French 113, 131. Prospec\u00ad tive elementary and secondary school teachers who choose this option should take as electives additional courses in French language, civilization, and/or literature. Work in French civilization is required by State credentialing authorities. French Major with Emphasis in Culture and Civilization: French 11, IOOA-B, IOIA-B-C and eight other upper-division courses taught in French, at least four of which must be in civilization and culture. Planning a Program of Study The student and the faculty advisor (assigned upon entering the major) should plan a coherent program of courses to ful\u00ad fill the literature, the linguistics, or the culture and civiliza\u00ad tion emphasis during the junior year. The Department encourages the student to study in France, either through the University's Education Abroad Program or independently. Information is available in the Department Office. Students should consult with the departmental coordinator of advisors concerning career plans in the areas of teaching, industry, journalism, law, civil service, etc. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM IN ITALIAN Third-and fourth-year offerings provide an introduction to Italian literature and culture that serves as a basis for compo\u00ad sition, conversation, and phonetics. Tutorial and seminar courses are available for advanced stu\u00ad dents. Students are encouraged to pursue their interests through a major in Humanities, leading to a B.A. degree in Humanities, which combines Italian literature, culture, his\u00ad tory, art, and music. GRADUATEPROGRAMINFRENCH The Department stresses understanding rather than encyclo\u00ad pedic knowledge, experimentation with various critical approaches rather than the perpetuation of a tradition, crea\u00ad tivity rather than conformity. Each quarter internationally known scholars are in residence to participate in the graduate program. Students choose their courses from three cate\u00ad gories: (I) Critical Theory: problems in French literature and criticism; (2) Comparative Methods; (3) Author, Genre, Period, Movement Master of Arts in French The Master of Arts degree is considered to be a step toward the Ph.D. degree; only students intending to pursue studies for the doctorate are admitted to the program. Performance on the Master's examination, usually given in the second year of graduate study, determines entrance into the doctoral pro-gram. Most candidates take a minimum of 11 graduate courses, with at least six in literature, one in linguistics, and one in writing and style. Particularly well-prepared students may receive special permission to take a minimum of nine courses and to write a short thesis, for which two course credits are given. All entering graduate students are assigned a faculty advisor. Individual programs are arranged in consul\u00ad tation with the faculty advisors. During the spring quarter of each year, the teaching performance and academic record of each student who is a Teaching Assistant are evaluated. All graduate students are also given a written evaluation of their work on a course-by-course basis. Proficiency in a foreign language in addition to French is required (proficiency is defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of course 2C). All M.A. candidates are required to pass a written and oral comprehensive examination on material drawn from the class program and the Master of Arts reading list. The student writes essays demonstrating an understanding of theoretical concepts and their application to the study of specific literary texts as well as an ability to establish relationships among literary works of different periods, genres, or authors. The written examination also allows the student to present an original topic of research. The oral part of the examination allows elaboration on aspects of the written examination, but seeks primarily to test the students' broader knowledge. The Master's examination is given in mid-fall quarter and at the end of winter quarter. Students who are Teaching Assistants normally take the examination in the fifth quarter of their studies. Doctor of Philosophy in French Upon successful completion of the Master's examinations and admission to the Ph.D. program, or admission with a Mas\u00ad ter's degree from an accredited institution, a Guidance Com\u00ad mittee is appointed to advise the candidate in the choice of courses to help prepare for the written and oral Qualifying Examinations leading to advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The formal Guidance Committee is composed of five members in fields closely related to the student's interest and projected area of specialization in which the dis\u00ad sertation will be prepared and one member who is not affil\u00ad iated with the School. One member of the committee will be expected to direct the dissertation. Language Requirements: A reading knowledge of two for\u00ad eign languages relevant to the student's area of specialization and subject to the approval of the Guidance Committee. Course Requirements: A minimum of 18 graduate courses or seminars in French beyond the B.A., including one graduate course in French linguistics, one graduate course in writing and style, and three graduate courses outside the Depart\u00ad ment in areas related to the field of specialization. Students entering with a B.A. degree are required to take at least three courses in each of these three course categories as they pro\u00ad gress to the Ph.D. degree; students entering with an M.A. degree must take at least two in each area. A student may pursue the Ph.D. with particular emphasis in literary theory by taking additional course work in theory beyond the minimum number required. Teaching: Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. candi\u00ad dates plan to teach, the Department recognizes its responsi\u00ad bility to train them as teachers. Therefore, as far as it is pos- UC IRVINE - 1982-1983sible, all candidates without previous teaching experience are required to participate in a program of supervised teaching for at least one year. Qualifying Examination -Written and Oral: Upon comple\u00ad tion of course work, the student takes a series of written open book examinations involving clearly defined problems of a critical or historical nature. The student may be given from one to three days to answer any part of the examination. The oral Qualifying Examination assesses the student's knowl\u00ad edge of French literature and understanding of a given liter\u00ad ary movement. The student will be examined on (a) five of the following six periods of French literature: Medieval; Six\u00ad Twentieth Century; or four of these periods plus the development of a single literary genre through all periods of French literature; (b) a given literary movement (e.g., Romanticism, Baroque, etc.) in a non-French literature. The written and oral parts of the examination are based both on material covered in the graduate seminars and on the Ph.D. reading list. Upon successful completion of the written and oral Qualifying Examinations, the student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Dissertation: The dissertation topic chosen by the candidate will normally, but not necessarily, fall within one of the major fields covered by the Qualifying Examination. The disserta\u00ad tion must be defended in an oral examination and approved by the Doctoral Committee before the candidate is recom\u00ad mended for the degree. Three faculty members, chosen by the candidate, proposed by the Department, and appointed by the Graduate Council, constitute the Doctoral Committee which directs the prepa\u00ad ration and completion of the doctoral dissertation. The Doc\u00ad toral Committee supervises an oral defense, the focus of which is the content of the doctoral dissertation, and certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory.

Newman, Ph.D. Princeton University, Assistant Professor of German Eric Rentschler, Ph.D. University of Washington, Associate Professor of German Wilfried M. Voge, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Lec!urer in German and Linguistics The Department of German sees its contribution in the con\u00ad text of the humanistic endeavor to understand and evaluate Western culture. We can understand ourselves and our immediate culture more clearly through the study of allied and diverse languages and cultures. The study of German (which is closely related to English) and a comparative study of the historical and social development of German-speaking peoples provide the student with another aspect of our com\u00ad mon culture. The Department offers courses on the German language and on German literature. The study of German literature is pursued from various critical perspectives. Some courses emphasize its historical, social, and political signifi\u00ad cance and setting; in others literature is approached as an imaginative experience which transcends its immediate con\u00ad text. The history of German literature and criticism, the the\u00ad ory of literature and literary criticism, and the relations of German literature to other literatures are also studied in the Department's courses. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The German major offers alternative emphases, one in litera\u00ad ture and another in linguistics. All courses in the Department are taught in German to the extent compatible with the aim of the course. In the basic courses the student will develop an understanding of the nature of the language, based on linguistic principles, while learning the necessary skills. Use will be made of the Lan\u00ad guage Laboratory. At the end of the first year, students will have attained mastery of the basic structure of the language. At the intermediate and advanced levels the student's ability to read and write German will be gradually developed. A third-year course of two quarters will stress composition as opposed to translation. It will be followed by a course in phonetics which will aim to perfect the pronunciation as well as to introduce historical and dialectal variants. The introduc\u00ad tory course in literature, also in the third year, will present a first view of some periods of German literary history, famil\u00ad iarize the student with German terminology used in the interpretation of literature, and use these concepts in practi\u00ad cal interpretations. A certain number of courses in the series German 117, 118, 119, 120 will be designated as \"core courses\" which are especially recommended for majors. It is assumed that the student is familiar with basic concepts of literature in English. Students are given the opportunity to participate in programs of study abroad during the summer and the junior year in Gottingen. Students entering UCI with previous German training will be given advanced standing as follows: In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus students with one, two, three, and four years of high school German will normally enroll in German 18, 1C, 2A and 28 respectively. Exceptions to this placement procedure must have the approval of the director of first-or second\u00ad year German instruction. Careers for the German Major German is excellent preparation for professional schools. It can be combined successfully with work in the natural sci-German 121 ences, business and management, and the computer sciences, and it is invaluable for advanced work in the humanities and the fine arts. An ability in German, when combined with other skills and specific training, can open up opportunities in communications, foreign trade and banking, transportation, government, science and technology, tourism, library ser\u00ad vices, and teaching. Recent graduates of the UCI German Department have begun careers in international law, business, the foreign ser\u00ad vice, the airline industry, professional translating, journalism, and all levels of education, including university teaching. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 12. School Requirements: See page 106. Departmental Requirements German Major with Literature Emphasis: German 100A-B\u00ad C; German 101; eight courses drawn from German 102-199, the selection to be approved by the student's advisor; at least one course selected from the following: Linguistics SO; Com\u00ad parative Literature SOA-B-C; courses in German history and Gerrnan philosophy (advisor's approval required). Students who plan to acquire a teaching credential, or intend to do graduate work in literature, are encouraged to take the major with literature emphasis. German Major with Linguistic Emphasis: German 100A-B\u00ad C; German 101; five literature courses drawn from German 102-199, to be approved by the advisor; Linguistics SO, 110, 120; at least one of the following: Linguistics 130; Introduc\u00ad tion to Middle High German or History of the German Lan\u00ad guage (these courses are offered under German 220). The German major with linguistic emphasis is recommended especially for students who intend to do graduate work in lin\u00ad guistics or enter a linguistics-related profession. GRADUATE PROGRAM In its graduate courses the Department stresses theoretical understanding of the nature of literature in its specific appli\u00ad cation to literature written in the German language. Courses also are offered elucidating the structure and history of the German language. The German Graduate Program is essentially a program lead\u00ad ing to the Ph.D. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than two years of full-time graduate study. The Department will decide after completion of the M.A., at the latest, whether or not to permit the student to continue in the Ph.D. program. The M.A. thus may be in some cases a terminal degree. In those cases where the student enters the UCI graduate pro\u00ad gram in German with an M.A. from another institution, the Department will evaluate the student's progress during the first year of study before deciding to allow continuation toward the Ph.D. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years or less. Master of Arts in German Before entering the program, a candidate is expected to have the equivalent of our undergraduate major. Students with a UC IRVINE - 1982-1983122 German bachelor's degree in another subject may be considered for admission. Normally their course of studies will have to be extended in order to make up for the deficiency. However, each case is considered individually by the faculty. The min\u00ad imum course requirement for the M.A. degree is nine courses, eight of which must be taken within the Depart\u00ad ment of German. Reading knowledge of a foreign language other than German also is required for the M.A. degree. Further requirements follow. The Preparation of a Reading List. All candidates should pre\u00ad pare as early as possible a list of works read in the field of German literature, e.g., both primary texts and critical works. This list should preferably be augmented by critical texts and by works from other literatures which, in the can\u00ad didate's opinion, relate to the German works in the list. Since it should ultimately contain representative selections from various eras of German literature and some works of criti\u00ad cism, a tentative list must be discussed with the graduate advisor before the end of the fall quarter. Candidates should indicate on the list a number of works with which they are especially familiar. In its final form (e.g., including works read during the year both in and out of class) the list will be sub\u00ad mitted together with the essay two weeks before the oral examination. It is the student's responsibility to keep the reading list current. The Master's Essay. The purpose of the written part of the M.A. comprehensive examination is to show the candidate's methodological progress in interpreting German literature. It consists of an essay in which a text is elucidated and related to: (a) pertinent works by the same author, (b) its social and historical context, and (c) other works of German or other literatures with which the candidate is familiar. The level of the discussion will normally be enhanced by the candidate's knowledge of the relevant secondary literature. The topic of the essay should be tentatively formulated and reported to the graduate advisor before the end of the second quarter of the student's residence. The Oral Examination. During the oral examination the fol\u00ad lowing items will be discussed: (a) the essay, (b) the reading list. The discussion based on the reading list will focus on works which the student knows well, but may broaden into other areas. One Course in University Teaching (399) One Year of Residence Ph.D. in German The Department requires a minimum of 24 approved courses from students entering with a bachelor's degree. Students entering with the master's degree will be advised individually as to remaining course requirements. These may include courses in philosophy, history, comparative literature, etc., suitable for the individual student's program of study. The course Introduction to Middle High German and one course in medieval German literature are required. The student also will enroll in each of the German Department's colloquia. The student will augment the reading list and keep it current during the whole course of study. At least two years of resi\u00ad dence are required. Since the majority of Ph.D. candidates choose careers as teachers, the German Department recognizes its obligation to offer them preparatory experience. Therefore, all candi\u00ad dates for the Ph.D. are required to teach under the supervi\u00ad sion of a faculty member at least one course in each of three quarters (for which they will receive credit as German 399). Three of these courses may be counted toward the 24 required courses for the Ph.D. Comprehensive Examination. There are two parts to the examination. In order to fulfill the written examination re\u00ad quirement the student will choose either (1) to present a lec\u00ad ture to the faculty and to the other graduate students, or (2) to write a three-part examination (one part on a signifi\u00ad cant author, one on a major genre, and one on a historical period) within a period of two weeks. These examination essays may be either closed-book or take-home, by agree\u00ad ment with the candidate's examination committee. The exam\u00ad ination essays or the lecture will be on a text or texts selected by the faculty from a reading list submitted by the student for the comprehensive examination. The second part of the comprehensive examination is the formal oral qualifying examination of up to three hours duration ranging over the whole field of the student's studies, to be taken within two weeks after completion of the written examination. The stu\u00ad dent will submit the reading list at least two weeks before the written examination after consultation with the members of the examination committee. Language Requirements. The candidate will demonstrate reading competence in two languages or extensive compe\u00ad tence in one language other than German or English. Choice of this language depends on the student's area of specializa\u00ad tion. For the various ways in which these requirements may be fulfilled, the student should see the graduate advisor. Dissertation. Toward the end of the second year of study, the student should formulate a tentative dissertation topic. Three faculty members proposed by the Department and appointed by the Graduate Council constitute the Doctoral Committee which directs the preparation and completion of the disserta\u00ad tion. The Doctoral Committee certifies that a completed dis\u00ad sertation is satisfactory through the signature of the Com\u00ad mittee members on the title page of the dissertation.

The Department offers a variety of approaches to history, and each emphasizes basic disciplinary skills: weighing evidence, expository writing, constructing logical arguments, and exploring the role of theory in historical analysis and human action. In addition to offering a number of lower-division history courses open to nonmajors, the Department requires all His\u00ad tory majors to participate in an introductory core course, His\u00ad tory 29A-B-C. This is a comparative course that acquaints students with the modern world by examining some of the basic characteristics of modernity and by focusing on the his\u00ad toric process of modernization in several different societies. From this introductory course the student moves on to a ser\u00ad ies of upper-division courses, the contents of which range from the examination of individual nation-states (e.g., British History), to studies of the relations among nation-states (e.g., European International History), to analyses of political, socio-economic, and cultural factors as they have developed through time (e.g., Mass Movements and Social Control). Students are also provided the opportunity for small-group learning experiences in a series of colloquia in the following areas: social history, political history, international history, intellectual history, social thought, and comparative history. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983124 History These courses bring a definite focus to the undergraduate major. Finally, colloquia and seminars for seniors concentrate on a particular aspect of more general phenomena (e.g., Hitler and World War II). The training and discipline derived from historical studies provide a valuable experience for all educated persons seeking to understand themselves and their world. They also provide a useful preparation for professional careers in teaching, law, librarianship, journalism, and business administration. Faculty members in the Department of History work closely with their students. Elected student representatives-both graduate and undergraduate-participate regularly with faculty at Department meetings and serve on major Depart\u00ad ment committees. Students also participate in the evaluation of teaching by faculty and Teaching Assistants. All upper\u00ad division History majors are assigned a faculty advisor, whom they are encouraged to consult at least once each quarter. Careers for the History Major Many students who complete undergraduate degrees in the Department of History go on to graduate school in a variety of fields, including history, law, business, international rela\u00ad tions, and teacher education. The study of history is valuable preparation for many other careers as well. The strong aca\u00ad demic and professional orientation acquired by History majors is necessary to pursue successful careers in such diverse fields as advertising, banking, journalism, manage\u00ad ment, public relations, publishing, and government service. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 12. School Requirements: See page 106. Departmental Requirements Fourteen courses are required, including History 29A-B-C (for which transfer students may substitute such year-long surveys as European, American, Asian, or Latin American history), six upper-division Historical Studies courses, three colloquia, and a senior seminar (two-course sequence) or two additional colloquia. GRADUATE PROGRAM The graduate program leading to the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in History is designed to provide students with both basic historical skills and a rigorous grounding in social and other comparative theory. This combination of theoretical study with training in historical method reflects the Department's conviction that scholars should be encouraged to deal with broad questions about the past and to approach these ques\u00ad tions in a methodologically sophisticated way. This approach requires that the student develop the critical abilities neces\u00ad sary to deal with primary sources, secondary syntheses, and the interrelationship of history and theory. Candidates for any advanced degree in History are expected to gain teaching experience as an integral part of their graduate training. Ordinarily this is accomplished through service as a Teaching Assistant or Associate. Basic to the Department's curriculum is a year-long course in History and Theory which deals with both theoretical texts and historical studies that have tested the theorists' concepts and models. The History and Theory course also examines the phenomenon of moderniziation-the general world transformation of the past four hundred yea~s-and seeks to understand the social institutions through which this process occurred and continues. The course directs attention to the diverse implications of modernity in the modern world, to the groups which dominated and were dominated by it, and to the costs and benefits of the process. These matters can be studied most satisfactorily by the historian whose theoretical self-conciousness and methodological facility have been sys\u00ad tematically and carefully developed. A two-quarter research seminar is offered fall and winter quarters every year and is required of all graduate students (including those entering with an M.A. degree) in both their first and second years. This course familiarizes students with at least one of the functional approaches to history (e.g., social, political, intellectual, international), the modes in which it has been written, and the methodologies available within it. At the same time the course makes it possible for students to begin carrying out projects of original research. The colloquium, a reading course that examines the chief his\u00ad torical works in a \"time-place\" field, enriches the student's knowledge of the main areas of historical research and devel\u00ad ops critical reading skills. Colloquia are offered yearly in American history and modern European history, and biannu\u00ad ally in Early Modern European history, Latin American his\u00ad tory, and Ancient history. A student may prepare a disserta\u00ad tion in any of these fields. In addition, independent reading and research courses are provided for advanced, specialized study in a tutorial form. The immediate objective for the doctoral student is to develop four fields of competence in preparation for compre\u00ad hensive examination. These fields are: history and theory; first \"time-place\" field (field in which the dissertation is writ\u00ad ten); second \"time-place\" field; \"focus\" field (such as social, political, intellectual, or international history). The subsequent objective, to write a distinctive dissertation, is of crucial importance. To assist in accomplishing both objectives, the Department offers intensive consultation with the faculty as well as a lively intellectual atmosphere. Stu\u00ad dents have long shared in the decision-making processes of the Department, which engages the entire historical commu\u00ad nity at Irvine in the collective pursuit of excellence. Students profit also from a vigorous visiting speakers program that brings scholars from other campuses and other nations to meet and interact with UCI students and faculty.

Though it is desirable that an applicant have the equivalent of an undergraduate major in History, the Department also welcomes students who have previously specialized in other subject areas and who show promise of sustained and self-disciplined work in history. Typically, a minimum undergraduate grade point average of 3.0 (B) is required for admission, with evidence of better work in history. In addition, all applicants are asked to submit three letters of recommendation, aptitude scores from the Graduate Record Examination, and examples of written work in history from their undergraduate classes. Students living in Southern California must arrange to come to UCI for an interview with the Department Chair or the Coordinator of Graduate Advising. Students are admitted for fall quarter only, and the deadline for application for fall admission is May 1. Program of Study. The M.A. program emphasizes the theo\u00ad retical, comparative, and social dimensions of the field in gen\u00ad eral, and of European, American, or Latin American history in particular. Each candidate for the M.A. will be assigned to a graduate advisor who will supervise the student's program. Nine courses are required for the degree: three in History and Theory (History 200A-B-C), three in \"time-place\" col\u00ad loquia (taken in sequence, as a unit), two in a two-quarter UC IRVINE - 1982-1983research seminar, and one from other \"time-place\" colloquia or from upper-division offerings. Students intending to pursue the Ph.D. should begin at once to delineate doctoral interests in order to fit their work for the M.A. into the total program. Language Requirements. Normally a reading knowledge of one foreign language is required for the M.A. degree. Stu\u00ad dents in American history, with an advisor's permission, may substitute a sequence of courses in communications science, statistics, or comparable studies for the M.A. foreign lan\u00ad guage requirement. Language proficiency can be demon\u00ad strated either by achieving a score of at least 500 on the appropriate ETS examination or by passing a departmental examination. Comprehensive Examination. At the end of the final quarter the M.A. candidate must pass a comprehensive examination covering the student's major field (e.g., American, Early Modern Europe) and focusing upon material assigned in the three-quarter \"time-place\" colloquium series. Time Limits. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than two years of graduate study. Doctor of Philosophy in History Requirements for Admission. Continuing students must have satisfactorily passed a departmental evaluation in order to be admitted to the doctoral program. New students must undergo a more formal admissions procedure, submitting transcripts, letters (three), papers, and aptitude scores from the Graduate Record Examination. These documents must be supplemented by an interview whenever possible. It would be advisable for thP potential doctoral student to begin graduate work on this campus, since the doctoral stu\u00ad dent who has taken the M.A. elsewhere will be expected to enroll in most of the same courses required of incoming M.A. students (greater experience will work to advantage later, in the second and third years, in speeding the student to examinations). Incoming students are admitted for fail quarter only, and the deadline for application for fall admission is May I. Program of Study. The Department requires doctoral stu\u00ad dents to prepare themselves in four different areas: I. History and Theory. 2. The first \"time-piace\" field (such as Modern Europe), which is designed as a teaching field as well as the focus of the student's dissertation. 3. The second \"time-place\" field (such as American History), which is designed as a second teaching field. 4. A \"focus\" field (such as social history, etc.), which is designed to enhance the student's capability for dealing with the problems and phenomena of the field, to make compari\u00ad sons, and to introduce the student to the theory and method of relevant related disciplines (e.g., sociology). The courses required in this preparation include the History and Theory sequence, colloquia series in both time-place fields, and the two research seminar sequences (two quarters each). Beyond these, the remainder of the student's program during the first six quarters of residence will consist of those colloquia, seminars, and courses in Special Studies. The nor\u00ad mal academic load is three courses per quarter. Every doctoral student will be assisted by a departmental ad\u00ad visor in the same general area of study who will be responsi-History 125 ble for approving defined fields, guiding the student to con\u00ad sultant faculty, and supervising the examinations. Language Requirements. All students, except as specified below, must demonstrate a reading knowledge of one foreign language relevant to the field of graduate study, no later than the end of the second year in the program. Normally, the M.A. foreign language will fulfill this requirement, but profi\u00ad ciency can also be established by a score of at least 500 on the appropriate ETS examination or by passing a department test. Students in American history who have opted for a lan\u00ad guage substitute in completing the UCI Master's degree will be allowed to submit this work in fulfillment of the \u00b7alternate skill requirements discussed below, and will not be subject to the time limit in achieving a foreign language competence. Additional language requirements depend on the subject the student selects for the first \"time-place\" field and must be met before the student takes the candidacy qualifying exami\u00ad nations. An individual with a first \"time-place\" field in Amer\u00ad ican history may either demonstrate a reading knowledge of a second useful foreign language (by achieving an ETS score of 500 or by passing a language test designed by the advisor), or complete, as a doctoral student, a sequence of courses in an alternate skill (e.g., communications science, statistics, computer work, content analysis, linguistics) that will be use\u00ad ful in mastering the chosen historical fields. An individual with a first \"time-place\" field in a non\u00ad American subject must demonstrate a reading knowledge of a second foreign language. This may be done either by achieving an ETS score of 500 or by passing a language test arranged by the advisor. Qualifying Examinations and Dissertation. After completing the appropriate courses and other preparatory work (nor\u00ad mally seven to nine quarters after entering the graduate pro\u00ad gram at UCI), the student will take written examinations in the History and Theory and two \"time-place\" fields, followed by the oral Qualifying Examination in the \"focus\" field, first \"time-place\" field, and dissertation topic. Upon successful completion of these examinations, the student will be advanced to candidacy and will begin intensive work upon the dissertation. The research and writing involved in this effort are expected to require from one to two years. At the end of this period an oral defense of the dissertation will be held, focusing on the adequacy of the student's research and thesis. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years or less.

SPECIAL PROGRAMS IN THE HUMANITIES UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR IN HUMANITIES The major in Humanities is one of the many options available to a student who wants to select a major in the School of Humanities. As such, the major in Humanities is on a par with the major in Spanish, the major in Classics, the major in Linguistics, and other majors in the School. The major in Humanities accommodates students who want to organize their undergraduate education around a humanistic perspec\u00ad tive on a topic, a field, or a problem which is interdisciplinary in scope (e.g., Literature and Politics in Twentieth-Century America; The Problem of Community; Social and Religious Thought in the Age of the Reformation). The student enters the program at the end of the sophomore year and, in consul\u00ad tation with the Humanities Major Committee, devises an individually tailored set of \"major requirements,\" not all of which need be offered in the School of Humanities. The Committee will assign an advisor on the basis of the stu\u00ad dent's own preference. At the end of the senior year the stu\u00ad dent will prepare, under the advisor's supervision, a long paper in the area of the special major. This requirement is satisfied by taking Humanities 199. A student majoring in the Humanities must also meet the regular School, UCI, and University requirements for graduation. (See p. 12 and p. 106.) Inquiries by third-quarter sophomores should be addressed to the academic counselors in the School's Office of Undergraduate Study. CONCENTRATION IN FILM STUDIES Participating Faculty Franco Tonelli, Ph.D. Louisiana State University, Director (film the\u00ad ory, French and Italian cinema) Susan Barber, Visiting Lecturer (history of film, American cinema) David Carroll, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University (film history and criticism, French cinema, film and society) Eugenio Donato, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University (film theory, Italian cinema) Thomas Girvin, Visiting Lecturer (film production) Oakley Hall, M.F.A. University of Iowa (fiction writing, film adaptation) UC IRVINE - 1982-1983128 Special Humanities Programs Renee Riese Hubert, Ph.D. Columbia University (Surrealist film/ fantastic film, early comedy) Alejandro Morales, Ph.D. Rutgers University (Latin American film) Eric Rentschler, Ph.D. University of Washington (German film, his- tory and theory) A student may major in Humanities with a concentration in Film Studies. The major centers on an interdisciplinary study of film history and criticism. The program is designed to study filmic concepts through a core of courses which will concentrate on film theory, history of film, formal structures, ideology, and relationship to the other art forms. While the Concentration in Film Studies emphasizes history and theory of film, through courses such as Humanities 50A\u00ad B-C 197, and 198 it tries to expose the student to practical and/or technical aspects of the study of cinema as well. In these latter courses students acquire practical experience in script writing, directing, camera, sound, editing, and applied aesthetic. The Theatrical Film Symposium (Humanities SOC) brings in a visiting writer, producer, director, performer, or the like to screen their latest work and discuss it with the students. Students majoring in Humanities with a concentration in Film Studies may spend their junior year in France studying at the Inter-University Center for Film and Critical Studies in Paris, through a program sponsored by the University's Edu\u00ad cation Abroad Program (EAP). Information is available in the Film Studies Office and from the EAP Office. Career Opportunities Besides providing students with a solid grounding in human\u00ad istic studies to allow them to pursue a number of educational or business opportunities, normally offered by a liberal arts major, an emphasis in Film Studies prepares students: (a) to seek a career at the production or commercial end of the rapidly growing entertainment industry; (b) to go to graduate school in film studies; (c) to continue literary studies con\u00ad nected with film. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 12. School Requirements: See page 106. Program Requirements: Humanities 50, 101A-B-C 110, 112 (two courses), 115, and 199, and four upper-division courses from the following: French 160, Italian 160, German 160, Russian 160, Spanish 160.

The student chooses a director of the project and a coreader. Honors Concentration in Social Thought The School of Humanities and the School of Social Sciences offer an honors concentration in Social Thought. The con\u00ad centration offers undergraduates the opportunity to examine major social theories and their implications in a systematic and thorough way. In exploring the intellectual foundations UC IRVINE - 1982-1983and contemporary development of modern social thought, students will develop their skills in critical analysis of society and theory. The concentration identifies whole societies as its objects of knowledge. It has as its central focus alternative conceptions of society's structure, historical development, and future prospects as perceived and analyzed by political and social philosophers, historians, social scientists; and literary writers. The concentration is taken in addition to a major in the School of Humanities or the School of Social Sciences. Thus, a student would major in, e.g., History and Social Thought or Political Science and Social Thought. Students interested in this program should apply to a member of the faculty steer\u00ad ing committee. A student is admitted to the program on the recommendation of the steering committee. Students are selected on the basis of aptitude for theory. A grade point average of at least 3.2 is required for admission, and in order to complete the honors program a grade point average of at least 3.5 must be attained in courses in the Social Thought concentration. Two core courses, two courses in surveys of theory, and two courses in intensive studies of theorists will be required. Additional problem-centered courses will be recommended. Lists of courses in these categories and of the current mem\u00ad bership of the steering committee may be obtained from the Social Sciences Advising Office or the Office of Undergradu\u00ad ate Study in the School of Humanities. A senior honors the\u00ad sis is required. Concentration in Women's Studies The Women's Studies concentration is not a major but is intended to allow a student to complement any major in the School of Humanities, the School of Social Sciences, or the Program in Social Ecology by studying systematically women in culture and society. The student will follow an interdisci\u00ad plinary course of study designed in consultation with a faculty advisor from the Women's Studies Committee. In addition to the two-quarter upper-division core courses (Humanities ISSA-B), the concentration also includes two courses each in the social sciences or social ecology, and the humanities. This will ensure that students acquire at least two different methodologies. UNDERGRADUATE COURSES The following set of courses has no necessary relation to the undergraduate major in Humanities. The courses are, of course, open to any UCI student. Humanities IA-B-C is required for the major in Humanities, as it is a requirement of any student majoring in the School of Humanities. Also, Humanities 199 is required of any undergraduate in the School who majors in Humanities. Humanities 1A-B-C The Humanities Core Course (8-8-8) F, W, S. Required of all Humanities majors and to be taken in the freshman year. From year to year different problems of concern to the various humanistic disciplines (history, literature, philosophy) are taken up, with emphasis on the careful reading of certain major texts that bear on these problems and on the development of the ability to think clearly and write well about the issues they raise. A writing program is an integral part of the course and counts for half the grade each quarter. (I), (IV) Humanities 10 Humanities Skills Development (0) F, W, S.

However, some Ph.D. students in regular programs in the School may elect an interdisciplinary modifi\u00ad cation of their degree with the permission of the departments or programs concerned. Such students will do about 60 per\u00ad cent of their graduate work in a major field and about 40 per\u00ad cent in one or more minor fields. At least one of the student's courses will be in the Humanities series 200-230. Those interested in an interdisciplinary degree should contact the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies or the Graduate Ad\u00ad visor in their major department. GRADUATE COURSES Graduate courses in Humanities are under the direction of the School's Associate Dean for Graduate Studies. These courses are designed for all graduate students in the School of Humanities, with the exception that students in philosophy may not count Humanities 230 as part of their degree program. Humanities 200, 210, 220, and 230 introduce study in four disciplinary areas, either to students planning a degree in his\u00ad tory or one of the literature departments or to those s~eking familiarity with disciplines other than their own.

PROGRAM IN LINGUISTICS Bernard Tranel, Ph.D. University of California, San Diego, Director of the Program and Associate Professor of French and Linguistics Richard Barrutia, Ph.D. University of Texas, Professor of Spanish and Linguistics (currently Education Abroad Program Director in Madrid) Peter Colaclides, Ph.D. University of Athens, Professor of Classics Mary Ritchie Key, Ph.D. University of Texas, Professor of Linguistics Tracy D. Terrell, Ph.D. University of Texas, Associate Professor of Spanish and Linguistics Owen Thomas, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles, Profes\u00ad sor of Linguistics, English, and Education Wilfried M. Voge, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Lecturer in German and Linguistics (See also the School of Social Sciences for additional faculty in Linguistics.) UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Linguistics is concerned with descriptions of human lan\u00ad guages, with theories that seek to explain the nature of lan\u00ad guage, and with the various uses of language. Additionally, linguistics has potential relationships with other disciplines concerned with language. Because of the various possibilities in emphasis, the programs are highly flexible. The undergraduate major in Linguistics is offered by the School of Humanities and by the School of Social Sciences. The UCI campus programs are administered by an inter\u00ad School Linguistics Committee. Students are able to select a Linguistics major in either School according to their interests. There are three ways to major in Linguistics as an under\u00ad graduate. They are designated as Tracks I, II, and III. Track I, General Linguistics, will appeal to students who wish to receive a broad introduction to the major subfields of Lin\u00ad guistics. Track I may be taken either through the School of Humanities or through the School of Social Sciences. Track II, Theoretical and Formal Linguistics, will appeal to stu\u00ad dents interested in areas of the cognitive sciences such as psychology and artificial intelligence. Track II is available through the School of Social Sciences. Track III, Applied Linguistics (Language Teaching and English as a Second Language), will appeal to students interested in language teaching including but not limited to the teaching of English as a second language. Track III is available through the School of Humanities. Students may also major in Classics, French, German, and Spanish with an emphasis in Linguistics. Students are encouraged to consider a double major in Lin\u00ad guistics and either English or a foreign language. This is especially recommended for students following Track III. Students who double major may not satisfy requirements in one major with courses which count for the other major, unless the same course is required for both majors. Careers in Linguistics A major in Linguistics prepares students for a wide variety of careers-in teaching, law, publishing, and public service, among others. Linguistics at UCI is also excellent preparation for graduate work in a number of areas. General Linguistics prepares students for advanced work in the field; Theoretical and Formal Linguistics students may continue work in formal linguistics, psychology, or other areas in the cognitive sci\u00ad ences; and those who concentrate in Applied Linguistics may pursue careers in the teaching 0f English as a second lan\u00ad guage or in other language teaching.

Each discipline inevitably poses prob\u00ad lems concerning the nature of the standards appropriate to it and the place of its subject matter within the total frame\u00ad work of human knowledge. If we are to understand science or art or literature, or such human practices as morality and religion, we are bound to address ourselves to philosophical issues relating to their nature, the uses of reason appropriate to them, and the contributions they make to our understand\u00ad ing and appreciation of ourselves and the world in which we live. Careers for the Philosophy Major The study of argument and the precision and clarity of thought and writing required of Philosophy majors are excel\u00ad lent preparation for a variety of careers. Many undergradu\u00ad ates trained in philosophy go on to professional schools in medicine, business, or law. The analytical skills developed in philosophy courses seem to be especially useful in legal edu\u00ad cation; indeed, many UCI philosophy graduates have estab\u00ad lished fine records at top law schools. Former philosophy stu\u00ad dents also have used their skills to advantage in careers in government, business, teaching, law enforcement, and com\u00ad puter programming. Many Philosophy majors also continue their education at the graduate level, either in philosophy or a related discipline. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Instruction in philosophy relies essentially upon discussion in which students are active participants. Wherever possible, therefore, classes are severely limited in size in order to per\u00ad mit sustained dialogues between student and instructor. Some of the courses offered are of general interest to a.II stu\u00ad dents. Others are designed to explore issues that arise in selected and special disciplines. Among these .are courses in the philosophy of science and of art. The staff should be con\u00ad sulted for advice about courses best suited to the specialized needs of particular students. The program of course offerings is also designed for those majors in philosophy whose intention may be either to enter some professional school upon graduation (e.g., law) or to engage in graduate work in philosophy. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 12. School Requirements: See page 106. Departmental Requirements Philosophy 50, Philosophy 20 and 22 and either 21 or 23; two of the following: Philosophy 100A-B; llOA-B; llSA-B; two additional quarter courses from Philosophy 101-199. GRADUATE PROGRAM . Students are encouraged to seek the counsel of any and all members of the Department whose recommendations the student would deem helpful. It is hoped that there will be a Philosophy 133 close intellectual relationship between graduate students and professors in order to provide the students with optimum conditions for philosophical development and to expedite their progress toward advanced degrees. In addition, the Department sponsors a series of colloquia each year. Partici\u00ad pation in these colloquia is an important part of the graduate student's training. Every new graduate student is assigned a committee of faculty members whose purpose is to oversee the student's progress through the major requirements for the advanced degree. The student consults with the committee each quar\u00ad ter about progress and any administrative or academic diffi\u00ad culties. Each student's overall record is evaluated by the Department each year, customarily during the first two weeks of March. When the student has satisfied residency, language, logic, and portfolio requirements, the Candidacy Committee supervises the qualifying examination and the development of a dissertation project, and the subsequent writing of the dissertation itself. The Chair of this committee is the principal person with whom the graduate student will consult on the dissertation. Master of Arts in Philosophy There is no list of courses required for the M.A. degree. The M.A. program in Philosophy takes one year at a minimum. The student may elect to follow either of the following routes to the degree: write a thesis on a subject to be chosen in consultation with an advisor and defend the thesis in an oral examination, or satisfy the Logic and Portfolio require\u00ad ments for the Ph.D. (see below). Please refer to the Graduate Studies and Research section for information on the min\u00ad imum number of courses required for the M.A. degree. Advancement to candidacy for the M.A. degree is not auto\u00ad matic, but requires formal application to the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and ,Research via the Philosophy Department Office. Application must be made with the recommendation of the Philosophy Department and must take place before the beginning of the quarter in which the student expects to receive the degree. Doctor of Philosophy in Philosophy There is no set number of courses required for the Ph.D., thus allowing course work to be tailored to the individual student's needs and interests. However, as a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree, every student is required to have some experience in teaching. The Ph.D. program is designed to take four years for the normally qualified student. In exceptional cases it may be possible to obtain the degree within three years. A Master's degree is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. The following five items are requirements for the Ph.D. degree. Tools of research, to be satisfied by demonstrating profi\u00ad ciency in a single appropriate foreign language* or by passing with a grade of B or better five to six courses at the graduate level in a discipline or disciplines outside of the Philosophy *The foreign language examinations are administered by the Department of Philosophy. They are two hours in length and con\u00ad sist of translating, with the aid of a dictionary, passages from two authors. Students wishing information as to courses to prepare them for these examinations and dates when these examinations will be given should consult the Philosophy Department Office, 500 Humanities Office Building, (714) 833-6526. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983134 Philosophy Department. Approval for the latter alternative will be granted by the Department only if, in its judgment, the courses form an integrated unit in light of the student's research interest. Logic, to be satisfied by (I) passing Philosophy 151 with a grade of B or better, or passing an examination prepared by the Department on equivalent material, and (2) passing with a grade of B or better one course in a mathematically rigor\u00ad ous subject that requires the student to carry out detailed mathematical proofs of significant theorems. Examples of such subjects are: Proof Theory, Model Theory, Probability Theory, Game Theory, Mathematical Linguistics, Topology, Classical Mechanics, Relativity Theory, etc. Philosophy 153 will satisfy this portion of the requirement. Other courses will satisfy it only with the approval of the Department. Portfolio of papers representing the student's best work in philosophy. The papers may be, or may be based upon, essays written for course work. The topics of the papers will cover four fields in philosophy as well as at least three of the fol\u00ad lowing historical periods: Ancient, Medieval, Early Modern, Kant and Nineteenth Century, and Twentieth Century. Examples of fields in philosophy are metaphysics, epistemol\u00ad ogy, ethics, political philosophy, philosophy of religion, phi\u00ad losophy of science, aesthetics, and so on. Papers will be eval\u00ad uated by the faculty for the purpose of determining whether or not the student is ready to seek admission to candidacy. Advancement to candidacy and the writing of a thesis. Upon successful completion of the above requirements, the student will apply for advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree by filling out the appropriate forms and returning them to the Philosophy Department Office. A Candidacy Committee including one or two members from an academic area outside of Philosophy is then appointed by the Graduate Council. This Committee administers an oral Qualifying Examination to determine whether the student is qualified to begin work designed to lead to the completion of a thesis. Upon passing this oral examination, the student becomes a candidate for the Ph.D. degree. The Doctoral Committee appointed by the Graduate Council supervises the student's further course work and research, as well as the actual writ\u00ad ing of the doctoral thesis. The defense of the thesis. At a suitable point during the development of the thesis, the Doctoral Committee adminis\u00ad ters an oral examination, the focus of which is the content of the thesis itself. If at all possible, this examination will be given while the student is still in residence. UNDERGRADUATE COURSES 5 Problems of Philosophy (4) F, W, S.

PROGRAM IN RUSSIAN Helen Wei!, M.A. California State University, San Diego, Director of the Program and Lecturer in Russian (Russian language and methodology, contemporary Soviet prose, Russian culture and civilization, nineteenth- and twentieth-century Russian literature, contemporary guitar poetry) Mark Altshuller, Ph.D. Leningrad State University, Lecturer in literature; golden age of Rus\u00ad sian literature; history of Russian culture; Pushkin, his times, works, and life; modern Russian prose) Guy de Mallac, Ph.D. Cornell University, Professor of Russian (mod\u00ad ern Russian literature, comparative literature, literature and society, Russian intellectual thought, Pasternak's life and work) Elena Dryzhakova, Ph.D. Leningrad State and works; Herzen, his life and works; history of Russian and Soviet poetry; theory of poetry; teaching \u00b7 methodology) Michael A. Green, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles, Associate Professor of Russian (Russian symbolist theater; relations between literature and the arts; eighteenth-century Russian theater, painting, and music) Russian is a language spoken by 215 million people in the Soviet Union and ranks with English and Chinese as one of the three major world languages. Russian is a language of the Indo-European family and is thus related to English, French, and German. Russian is an infinitely rich language, as is Eng\u00ad lish, and adapts itself well to a variety of styles and genres from lyric love poetry to the seeming harshness and brash\u00ad ness of the futurist poets. For the first two years, the Program in Russian emphasizes a combination of speaking, writing, and reading skills. At the end of the senior year, the student can expect to have at\u00ad tained a rather high level of proficiency in all language skills-reading, writing, speaking, and understanding. By then students will have read a number of selected literary texts-including a fair portion of the significant master\u00ad works-in the original. They will also have familiarized themselves with some of the historical background of the language and with its relation to other Slavic and European languages. And they will have achieved a reasonable degree of familiarity with the major cultural and social trends in Russian history. In addition to the regular Russian major with emphasis on language and literature, the Program in Russian offers a modified major with emphasis on linguistics. This major was designed for those students who have no plans to pursue advanced study in Russian literature, while they wish to focus on the study of the structure of Russian viewed within the framework of Slavic and general linguistics. The Program in Russian also offers a major with an emphasis in Russian civilization, which is geared to the interests of students who do not intend to specialize in Russian language and literature. This emphasis is based upon a multidiscipli\u00ad nary approach (through language, the arts, literature, history, study of institutions) to the rich variety of a culture that both before the Revolution and during the Soviet period has made an important contribution to mankind's heritage and en\u00ad deavors. Various specializations and challenging new career possibilities in today's world are available to students electing this option. Students planning to major in Russian should obtain a copy of the brochure \"Russian Language, Literature, and Civiliza\u00ad tion at UCI\" from the Office of the Program in Russian. Stu\u00ad dents entering UCI with previous training in Russian will be given advanced standing as follows: In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, and four years of high school Russian will enroll in Russian lB (or lOB), lC (or lOC), 2A (or llA), and 2B (or llB), respectively. Exceptions to this ruling can be made but must have the approval of the Program Director. Students with high school training in Rus\u00ad sian should consult with the Russian staff before enrolling in Russian courses. The Self-Paced Program: lOA-8-C/llA-B-C During the regular academic year, the Program in Russian offers students a self-paced option in the first and second years of language study. The Self-Paced Program is designed to accommodate students who cannot attend regular class meetings, or who wish to progress toward language compec tence at their own pace (please see lOA-B-C and llA-B-C). Students interested in enrolling in the Self-Paced Program should contact the Director of the Program in Russian. UCI Summer Russian Institute and Practicum In planning their programs of study, students should note that certain courses bearing the designation Summer are also offered within the three-week UCI Russian Institute and Practicum (Russian lA-B-C, 199, 220, 290, and The UCI Russian Language Institute is a three-week, total-immersion program in Russian lan\u00ad guage and culture for students of all levels, conducted entirely in Russian and encompassing all of the student's daily activities. The Practicum adjunct of the Institute affords prospective and practicing language teachers an opportunity for intensive language review and participation in established and experimental teaching methods. For information and reg\u00ad istration forms contact the Director of the UCI Russian Insti\u00ad tute and Practicum, Program in Russian, University of Cali\u00ad fornia, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 12. School Requirements: See page 106. Departmental Requirements Russian Major with Emphasis on Literature: Russian 1A-B\u00ad 170. Russian Major C (or 10A-B-C); 2A-B-C (or llA-B-C); 50; the following: History 123A-B-C, Social Sciences 122A, Russian 160, 180. Planning a Program of Study The Program in Russian believes in close consultation with students on academic advising, program planning, and discus\u00ad sion of goals and direction. Students planning to major in Russian with an emphasis on literature or on linguistics are strongly urged to consult with the departmental faculty as early as possible, in order to familiarize themselves with the nature of the various programs. After indicating an intention to major in Russian, the student is assigned to an academic advisor who will help in the task of selecting courses toward the completion of one of the three options open to students majoring in Russian studies at UCI. Special attention is paid to the unique aspects of the Russian field. In particular, students' attention is alerted to the com\u00ad bined academic and career implications and potentialities of these major options. Career Opportunities The major in Russian may lead to a career with the federal government, in private enterprise, or in education. The U.S. Departments of State, Defense, Health and Human Services, the Information Office, and the Library of Congress all hire people who can speak and write Russian. The United States Information Agency's Voice of America offers oppor\u00ad tunities in research, scriptwriting, editing, translating, and announcing. Because of the importance of Russia in world politics and economics, private businesses and corporations dealing in the international marketplace increasingly employ persons skilled in Russian language and knowledgeable about Russian soci\u00ad ety and political institutions. Individuals with degrees in Rus\u00ad sian may find employment in private enterprise as interprec ters and translators in the following areas: library science, communications media, science, and technology. Students who major in Russian may either go on to graduate programs or enter a career in education. Many students have entered teaching at the secondary level, while others, after graduate work in education, seek positions at colleges and universities. Since Russian is second only to English as a world language of science, the study of Russian provides access to a large body of the world's scholarly, scientific, and technical litera\u00ad ture. While the study of Russian language, literature, and civ\u00ad ilization provides training that may lead to careers similar to those described above, the major program is viewed primarily as a valuable component of a liberal education and an instru\u00ad ment for the investigation and appreciation of the modern world.

DEPARTMENT OF SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE Dayle Seidenspinner-Nunez, Ph.D. Stanford University, Chair of the Department and Associate Professor of Spanish (medieval Spanish and comparative literature) Richard Barrutia, Ph.D. University of Texas, Professor of Spanish and Linguistics and Director of the Madrid Study Center in the Education Abroad Program (1981-83) (applied linguistics, bilingualism and English as a second language) Anne J.

Sobek, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles, As\u00ad sociate Professor of Spanish (Latin American and Chicano folklore, bilingualism) Tracy Terrell, Ph.D. University of Texas, Associate Professor of Span\u00ad ish (applied linguistics and dialectology) .Juan Villegas, Ph.D. Universidad de Chile, Professor of Spanish {liter\u00ad ary theory, modern Spanish literature, Chilean poetry) Zidia Webb, M.A. Michigan State University, Lecturer in Spanish and Portuguese (Brazilian literature and culture) The main objectives of the program in Spanish and Portu\u00ad guese are to develop competence in the ability to understand, speak, read, and write Spanish and Portuguese, and to pro\u00ad vide through the knowledge of these two languages an understanding and appreciation of their literature and culture. Students are placed in Spanish courses according to their years of previous study and a placement test. In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. All courses in Spanish and Portuguese, unless specifically stated, are taught in the foreign language. By the end of the first year, students attain mastery of the basic structure of the language and ability to converse on everyday topics as well as to read and write on an elementary plane. Self\u00ad instructional courses in both Spanish and Portuguese are also available. In the second year, emphasis is put on gradually raising the level of the student's ability to read and write. A third-year course of two quarters stresses composition as opposed to translation. Further, a course in phonetics perfects pronunci\u00ad ation, introduces theoretical considerations, and presents his\u00ad torical and dialect variants of Spanish. The introductory courses in literature, also in the third year, emphasize the analysis and appreciation of complete literary works by genre rather than the study of many short selections of innumer\u00ad able authors in an anthology. The courses in Hispanic civiliza\u00ad tion combine a panoramic overview with a close look at a specific country or topic. Although no major in Portuguese is offered, advanced litera\u00ad ture courses are available. Students are encouraged to participate in programs of study abroad during the summer and the junior year. Elected representatives of the undergraduate majors, the graduate students, and the Teaching Assistants participate with full voting rights in Department meetings. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 12. School Requirements: See page 106. Departmental Requirements Spanish 10A-B, 11, 101A-B-C; 110A, B, or C. In addition, the UC IRVINE - 1982-1983student will choose one or more of the following emphases: Literature and Culture: Seven upper-division courses in literature with a minimum of one in Spanish-American litera\u00ad ture. Two courses in Hispanic culture and civilization may be substituted if desired. Linguistics: Linguistics 50, 110, 120; Spanish 113 and any three upper-division or graduate Spanish linguistics courses such as 100A-B-C, 186, 200, 201, 204, 205. Bilingualism and English as a Second Language: Spanish 100A (Multiple Subject) or 100B (Single Subject), Spanish 100C (ESL methods); one course in Chicano literature, one course in Chicano culture, Spanish 113, and two upper\u00ad division courses in literature at least one of which must be Latin American literature. (Education 140A-B-C is the same as Spanish 100A-B-C.) For students who plan to teach Spanish, the following courses are strongly recommended: Linguistics 50, Linguis\u00ad tics 140 (Second Language Acquisition), Spanish 113 (Spanish Linguistics). Also, Spanish 200 and Spanish 204 should be taken as seniors or as members of the credential program. Career Opportunities Spanish is particularly useful in international business or trade, community or social service, and in the foreign service. Spanish majors interested in writing may look to publishing, writing, or editing positions. Majoring in Spanish is excellent preparation for graduate and professional study in law, medicine, social welfare, library science, business or public administration, education, interna\u00ad tional relations, journalism, or advanced study in Spanish. An option available to Spanish majors is UCI's 3-2 Program offered by the Graduate School of Management, in which students may earn a Bachelor's degree in Spanish and a Mas\u00ad ter's degree in Management in five years rather than the usual six. Bilingualism and English as a Second Language are very use\u00ad ful preliminary emphases for many of the fields described above. These areas are closely related to the teacher prepara\u00ad tion program offered by the UCI Office of Teacher Education for students interested in the Bilingual/Cross Cultural Emphasis credential. Master of Arts in Spanish The candidate is expected to have the equivalent of our undergraduate major. The student takes a minimum of 11 courses, eight of which must be at the graduate level. Two of the 11 courses must be in linguistics. Spanish 239, Methods of Literary Criticism, is required of all literature majors. A maximum of two courses may be transferred from another university, but a maximum of five may be accepted from another University of California campus. Proficiency (defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of course 2C) in a foreign language other than the major language is required. The comprehensive examination, in part written, in part oral, will be based both on a reading list and the courses taken by the students and will also test the students' ability to express themselves correctly in Spanish. No thesis is required. The student may choose an emphasis in literature or linguistics. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than three years of graduate study. M.A. students are advised by a faculty member in their field of specialization. Normally only students who are studying for the Ph.D. are admitted to the graduate program. The comprehensive examination for the M.A. may be accepted as the written portion of the qualify\u00ad ing examination for the Ph.D. Spanish and Portuguese 139 M.A. T. in Spanish This program is specifically directed at meeting the needs of working credentialed teachers, although others may apply. It seeks to provide a group of modern, relevant courses that will enable teachers to keep abreast of recent developments in their field. It is structured so that working teachers can take courses in late afternoons, evenings, and summers, and may be completed in one academic year and two summer ses\u00ad sions. Applicants should have a B.A. in Spanish and should acquire proficiency in a foreign language other than Spanish. The program consists of 10 courses (eight of which must be at the graduate level) as follows: three courses in Hispanic literature; three courses in Hispanic civilization and litera\u00ad ture; three courses in Hispanic linguistics; and one course in Recent Trends in Foreign Language Teaching, to be combined with a curricular research project or a thesis. M.A.T. students are counseled by a faculty member in the Department. Bilingual/Cross-e ultural Emphasis The bilingual/cross-cultural emphasis is a specialization in addition to the regular teaching credential for high school (Single Subject) or elementary school (Multiple Subject). Undergraduates may plan from the beginning to aim for this emphasis by preparing themselves with a proficiency in the Spanish language. See page 234., Ph.D. in Spanish The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers a Ph.D. degree with a major in either Spanish or Spanish-American literature. The program attempts to integrate period and genre studies with work in literary theory, linguistics, and socio-historical studies. A number of courses outside of the Department are required. We thereby hope to aid in the for\u00ad mation of Ph.D. candidates who are not narrow specialists but rather scholars acquainted with the various fields that relate to their discipline. We are concerned also with the prac\u00ad tical aspects of helping our graduates become good teachers. The secondary field can be Spanish literature, Spanish\u00ad American literature, Spanish linguistics, literary theory, com\u00ad parative literature, or a non-Hispanic literature. Language Requirements A reading knowledge of Portuguese and other languages relevant to the student's area of specialization is required. The choice of language requires Department approval. Course Requirements A minimum of 23 courses is required for the Ph.D. as follows: A. Two graduate courses in linguistics, diachronic and syn\u00ad chronic (the students who select Linguistics as a secondary field will substitute two courses in either Spanish or Spanish-American literature); a course in literary theory (genre studies, etc.); a course in methods of literary criti\u00ad cism; a course on the socio-historical context of the period of the student's specialization; a course in Brazilian or Por\u00ad tuguese literature (preferably related to the student's spe\u00ad cialization); two courses outside of the Department in non-Iberic literatures; two courses in Spanish or Spanish\u00ad American literature, whichever is not the major. Ph.D. candidates should take one course in each genre within their area. B. Additional courses for the major and the secondary field: 1. Ten courses in the major. Those students who major in twentieth-century Spanish-American literature are UC IRVINE - 1982-1983140 Spanish and Portuguese required to take Spanish 238A-B: Spanish-American Literature in the Colonial Period and in the Nineteenth Century. 2. Three courses in the secondary field. Candidates who have the M.A. degree from another univer\u00ad sity will be interviewed by two professors representing peninsular and Spanish-American literature, in order to eval\u00ad uate their past studies in terms of our doctoral program; it is recommended that the student's graduate advisor direct the doctoral dissertation and that the choice of dissertation and director be made as early as possible. Each incoming graduate student will be assigned a faculty advisor who will supervise the student's program and with whom the student should meet at least once each quarter. All graduate students will be formally evaluated at the end of each year by the faculty with whom they have studied. Students pursuing a full-time pro\u00ad gram of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within five years or less. Teaching Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. candidates plan to teach, the Department recognizes its responsibility to train them as teachers. Therefore, all Ph.D. candidates without previous teaching experience are required to teach under supervision and at UCI one course in each of three quarters. All Ph.D. students will student-teach in an upper-division course related to the major. This will count as one of the required courses in the major. Comprehensive Examination The student is admitted to candidacy by passing, by a major\u00ad ity vote, an oral examination administered by a Candidacy Committee appointed by the Graduate Council. The Candi\u00ad dacy Committee is composed of five members, of whom four will be from the Department. The oral examination will be preceded by a written examination as follows: A. Choice The student, in consultation with the Doctoral Commit\u00ad tee, may choose one of the following options: I. A comprehensive examination including a dissertation project. The student will then take parts 1, 2, and 3 of the examination described below, and will submit a dis\u00ad sertation project. 2. A comprehensive examination including the minor instead of the dissertation project, part 4 of the exami\u00ad nation described below. B. The written comprehensive examination will consist of three parts: I. A genre in all periods. The student will demonstrate knowledge of literary theory and methods of literary criticism. 2. A historical literary period, including all of the genres and the socio-historical context. 3. Textual analysis. A representative text in the student's genre of specialization will be given to the student at the time of the examination. If the genre is poetry, the text may be a complete poem or a section from a larger poem. In the case of the short story, novel, theatre, or essay, a relatively brief organic section will constitute the text. The student's analysis should be intrinsic; it should also demonstrate the relationship of the text to the total work as well as to the author's total produc\u00ad tion and the author's position in the literary history of the country or the continent. 4. Dissertation project. During the year preceding the comprehensive exams, the student will write a disserta\u00ad tion project of approximately 40 typewritten (double\u00ad spaced) pages which will be turned in one month before the comprehensive exams. The topic as well as the dis\u00ad sertation advisor will be chosen by the student. The essay should: a. Define clearly the topic of the dissertation and jus\u00ad tify it by discussing its significance. b. Discuss previous studies on this topic and prove the originality of the new study. c. Describe and justify the critical method to be followed. d. Include a bibliography of special, general, and theo- retical works. Dissertation A dissertation topic will be chosen by the candidate and nor\u00ad mally, but not necessarily, will fall within one of the major fields covered by the Qualifying Examination. Three faculty members appointed by the Graduate Council will constitute the Doctoral Committee which supervises the preparation and completion of the doctoral dissertation. The Doctoral Committee supervises a final examination, the focus of which is the content of the dissertation. Ordinarily, the final examination will not be given after the dissertation is completed, but rather at an appropriate point during its development. Such final examination normally will be given while the graduate student is in residence at UCI. The Doc\u00ad toral Committee certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory through the signatures of the individual Com\u00ad mittee members on the title page.

UC IRVINE - 1982-1983142 Physical Sciences SCHOOL OF PHYSICAL SCIENCES Myron Bander Dean The School of Physical Sciences offers both professional training and general education in the Departments of Chem\u00ad istry, Mathematics, and Physics. The faculty, active in research and graduate education, are at the same time vitally concerned with undergraduate teaching. Curricula of the School are designed to meet the needs of a wide variety of students ranging from those with little technical background who seek insight into the activities and accomplishments of physical scientists to those seeking a comprehensive under\u00ad standing that will prepare them for creative research in phys\u00ad ical science. Over the course of the past century and a half, physics, chemistry, and mathematics have evolved into interdepen\u00ad dent but separate intellectual disciplines. This development is reflected in the departmental structure of the School of Phys\u00ad ical Sciences. In the same period, these fundamental disci\u00ad plines have moved into domains of abstraction unimagined by early scientists. This trend to abstraction with its concom\u00ad itant increase in understanding of the physical universe pro\u00ad vides the major challenge to the student of the physical sci\u00ad ences. Mathematics, physics, and chemistry, while providing the foundation of the technology that dominates contem\u00ad porary civilization, underlie to an ever-increasing extent the new developments in the biological and social sciences. In recognition of the contribution students can make to the academic affairs of the School, a variety of responsibilities on School and departmental committees is given to undergradu\u00ad ate and graduate students. Degrees Chemistry Honors Criteria used by the School of Physical Sciences in selecting candidates for honors at graduation are as follows: Approxi\u00ad mately I percent will be awarded summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude. Honors are awarded on the basis of a student's performance in research and cumulative grade point average. The School of Physical Sciences also grants special honors to students who have dis\u00ad tinguished themselves by their work in their major subject. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. UNDERGRADUATEPROG~S Each department offers courses that are of value to non\u00ad majors and majors in the sciences. The programs for majors are designed to meet the needs of students planning careers in business or industry, of students planning advanced pro\u00ad fessional study, and of students planning graduate work that continues their major interest. Introductory courses in chem\u00ad istry, mathematics, and physics meet the needs of students majoring in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering and are also appropriate for students in other disciplines who seek a rigorous introduction to the physical sciences. In addi\u00ad tion, a number of courses within the School have few or no prerequisites and are directed particularly toward students majoring in areas remote from the sciences. Planning a Program of Study Every undergraduate student who has chosen to major in Physical Sciences is assigned a faculty advisor. The name of this advisor is communicated to the student prior to enroll\u00ad ment or may be obtained from the Office of the Associate Dean or of the appropriate Department Chair. Students are free to change academic advisors at any time. Each depart\u00ad ment also has a Chief Academic Advisor who is responsible for interpreting degree requirements and dealing with special advising problems. An academic advising and counseling staff is also employed in the Associate Dean's Office and is avail\u00ad able to serve a broad range of student advising needs. In con\u00ad sultation with the advisor the student should plan a course of study leading to a major in one of the departments of the School. In carrying out this major, the student may often concentrate very heavily in a second department within the School or in some other school. Occasionally students choose to pursue a double major. Permission to do so may be sought by a petition submitted to the Office of the Associate Dean of Physical Sciences. All initial courses of study for majors include mathematics through calculus, and calculus is a prerequisite for much of the upper-division work in each major. A student interested in any of the physical sciences should continue mathematical training beyond these prerequisite courses. Furthermore, students interested in either physics or chemistry will usually include work in both of these subjects in their undergraduate careers. Students in the physical sciences are urged to acquire a work\u00ad ing knowledge of computer programming at an early stage of their University studies. This can be done by taking Informa\u00ad tion and Computer Science IA or IB, or Physics I. Career Opportunities The majority of UCI Physical Sciences graduates continue their education beyond the Bachelor's degree level. Many pursue advanced academic degrees in preparation for careers in scientific or medical research, engineering, or postsecon\u00ad dary education. Some students enter professional school in areas such as medicine, dentistry, law, or business adminis\u00ad tration. Students who choose not to continue their studies beyond the baccalaureate level most frequently find employ\u00ad ment in private business or industry. In addition to technical areas directly related to their major fields of study, students often enter careers in less obviously related fields such as computing, systems analysis, engineering, journalism, mar\u00ad keting, or sales. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 12. School Requirements In addition to the courses taken in fulfillment of the UCI breadth requirement, students with a major in the School of Physical Sciences are required to take one additional approved three-course group chosen from one of the follow\u00ad ing breadth categories: Category III (Social and Behavioral Sciences); Category IV (Humanistic Inquiry); or the Language and Linguistics section of Category V. For purposes of this requirement, the approved sequences are the same ones listed for the UCI breadth requirement, with the exception that any three consecutive foreign language courses are acceptable. GRADUATE PROGRAMS A program of course work and research leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees is offered in each of the three departments of the School. The individual programs are described in the following announcements of each department. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Physical Sciences 143 UC IRVINE - 1982-1983144 Chemistry DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY David A.

Taft, Ph.D. Ohio State University, Professor of Chemistry (substituent/solvent effects, acid/base chemistry) Max Wolfsberg, Ph.D. Washington University, Professor of Chemistry (theoretical chemistry) UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The major in Chemistry is elected by students planning careers in the chemical sciences and frequently also by those whose interests lie in biology, medicine, earth sciences, secondary education, business, and law. The curriculum of the Department is designed to satisfy the diverse needs of these students and others who may have occasion to study chemistry. The year course Chemistry 1A-B-C (or the two\u00ad quarter course Chemistry 61A-B) is prerequisite to all study in the Department at more advanced levels. The subject mat\u00ad ter of this course serves also as a thorough introduction to the varied aspects of modern chemistry for students who do not wish to pursue their studies beyond this introductory level. Chemistry 51A-B-C is a one-year sequence in organic chemistry which is required for Chemistry majors and for students of the life sciences. Certain more advanced courses required of Chemistry majors may also be of particular inter\u00ad est to the latter groups, among others. The undergraduate program of the Chemistry Department emphasizes close contact with research. Chemistry majors are urged to engage in research under the direction of a faculty member. Much of the important chemical literature is being and has been printed in foreign languages, principally German, Rus\u00ad sian, and French. Reading competence in one or more of these languages is desirable, and many graduate schools require the demonstration of such competence as a prerequi\u00ad site for an advanced degree. Chemistry majors are encour\u00ad aged to acquire this competence. Chemistry majors who are interested in teaching chemistry at the secondary level are urged to consult with their ad\u00ad visors and with the Office of Teacher Education early in their undergraduate careers. Chemistry majors who plan subse\u00ad quent study in medical, dental, or other professional schools should request information concerning admission require\u00ad ments directly from the schools which they seek to enter. Those intending to pursue graduate studies in chemistry should discuss their plans with their academic advisors. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 12. School Requirements: See page 142. Departmental Requirements Basic Requirements: Mathematics 2A-B-C, Physics 5A-B-C and 5LA-LB-LC, Chemistry 131A-B-C or 130A\u00ad B-C, Chemistry 151. Electives: Four courses chosen from the elective list below. These must include at least two courses offered by the Chemistry Department (Chemistry 180 may be counted no more than once, and Chemistry 192, 194, 196, and 199 may not be counted) and at least one of the laboratory courses in the following laboratory course group: Chemistry 152, Chemistry 153, Chemistry 160, Chemistry 170, Physics 150, Physics 151, Physics 152, Physics 153. Elective List: Chemistry 125, 135 and all Chemistry courses numbered 152-235, Bio. Sci. 106 (Biochemistry), Bio. Sci. 107 (Molecular Biology), Molecular Biology and Biochemistry 205A-B (Biochemistry), Physics 111A-B (Classical Mechan\u00ad ics), Physics 112A-B (Electromagnetic Theory), Physics 113A\u00ad B-C (Quantum Physics), Physics 115 (Statistical Physics), Physics 116 (Thermodynamics), Physics 132 (Nuclear Phys\u00ad ics), Physics 133 (Condensed Matter Physics), Physics 134 (Modern Optics), Physics 150 (Electronics for Scientists), Physics 151 (Advanced Laboratory), Physics 152 (Advanced Laboratory), Physics 153 (Advanced Laboratory). Scientific Breadth Requirements: A total of six additional four-or five-unit courses chosen from the offerings of the Departments of Mathematics and Physics and the School of Biological Sciences. (These may be taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis subject to the usual restrictions on Pass/Not Pass enrollment.) Planning a Program of Study The departmental requirements leave the student a great deal of latitude in choice of courses; the student can choose to pursue interests ranging from biochemistry on the one hand to chemical physics pn the other. Many of the basic require\u00ad ments above coincide with those of the School of Biological Sciences, and a double major in Chemistry and Biological Sci\u00ad ences does not require much extra course work. The Depart\u00ad ment is accredited by the American Chemical Society to offer an undergraduate degree certified by the Society as suitable background for a career in chemistry or for graduate study in chemistry. While it is not necessary, it is desirable for stu\u00ad dents to pursue a course of study that the American Chemi\u00ad cal Society judges to merit a certified degree. A certified UC IRVINE - 1982-1983degree specifically requires that the following courses be included in the program of study: Mathematics 3 (any two quarters); Chemistry 152 and 153; Chemistry 160, 170, or 180. Students should consult with their academic advisors on courses of study. A Chemistry major normally takes Chemis\u00ad try 1A-B-C and 1LB-LC, Mathematics 2A-B-C, and required writing courses during the freshman year. The sophomore year should include Chemistry 51A-B-C and 51LA-LB-LC; the Physics 5A-B-C and 5LA-LB-LC sequences should be completed no later than the fall quarter of the junior year. The balance of the freshman and sophomore program can be chosen at the student's discretion with consideration given to progress toward completion of the School of Physical Sci\u00ad ences breadth requirement, the UCI breadth requirement, and the Chemistry Department scientific breadth require\u00ad ment. In the junior year all Chemistry majors should enroll in the year sequence of physical chemistry (Chemistry 131A-B\u00ad C or 130A-B-C) and in Chemistry 107 (fall) and 151 (winter). During the junior and senior years the Chemistry Depart\u00ad ment electives requirement should be fulfilled, as should other University, School, and departmental requirements. There is no foreign language requirement, but Chemistry majors are urged to obtain reading competence in a foreign language through course work. Outlines of several typical programs of study for Chemistry majors, American Chemical Society-certified Chemistry majors, and Chemistry-Biological Sciences double majors have been prepared. Students are urged to obtain copies of the sample programs from their academic advisors, from the Chemistry Department Office, or from the Physical Sciences Associate Dean's Office. GRADUATE PROGRAM The Department offers graduate programs leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Chemistry. The Ph.D. degree is granted in recognition of breadth and depth of knowledge of the facts and theories of modern chemistry and an ability to carry out independent chemical research demonstrated through submission of an acceptable doctoral dissertation. The M.S. degree may be earned either through submission of an acceptable Master's thesis (Plan I) or through an approved program of graduate course work (Plan II). A Master's degree is not a prerequisite for admission to the Ph.D. program. Upon entering the graduate programs all students are required to take a series of Area Examinations which test the students' competence in the general areas of chemistry, e.g., organic, physical, inorganic, at the undergraduate level. The Area Examinations are designed to ensure a proper funda\u00ad mental level of preparation for graduate study and are used as a guide in choosing the appropriate program of course work for each entering student. Students in the Ph.D. program are expected to demonstrate their knowledge of chemistry at the advanced level through satisfactory completion of a series of Cumulative Examina\u00ad tions. These examinations are designed to encourage the independent study of chemistry through reading of the clas\u00ad sic and current chemical literature and attendance at advanced seminars and colloquia. Normally, beginning with the second year of graduate study, students must take the monthly examinations until four have been passed. This requirement must be satisfied within 12 consecutive Cumula\u00ad tive Examinations. Following completion of the Cumulative Examination require\u00ad ment, participants in the Ph.D. program take an oral exami\u00ad nation for formal Advancement to Candidacy. This examina-Chemistry 145 tion normally comes in a stude~t's third graduate year and consists of an oral defense before a faculty committee of the student's dissertation research project and a second original research proposition conceived, developed, and documented by the student. The committee may examine the student at this time on any subject it deems relevant to the independent pursuit of chemical research. Students in the Ph.D. and M.S. Plan I (Thesis) programs are required to complete a minimum of seven approved courses, including six graduate-level courses in chemistry. The M.S. Plan II (Course Work) program requires that the student complete 10 graduate-level chemistry courses. Graduate stu\u00ad dents are expected to maintain a grade point average of B or better to remain in good academic standing. Training in teaching is an integral part of each graduate pro\u00ad gram, and all graduate degree candidates are expected to par\u00ad ticipate in the teaching program for at least three quarters during their graduate career. The most important component of the Ph.D. program is the doctoral dissertation, which must describe the results of orig\u00ad inal research performed by the student under the supervision of a faculty member of the Department. The criterion for acceptability of the dissertation is that its contents be of a quality suitable for publication in a scientific journal of high editorial standards. Each Ph.D. candidate is expected to pre\u00ad sent the work described in the completed dissertation in a seminar before the Department, following which the candi\u00ad date will be examined in public on the contents of the disser\u00ad tation by a committee of the faculty. A Master's thesis pre\u00ad sented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the M.S. under Plan I must also describe the results of a student's orig\u00ad inal research performed under the direction of a faculty member. However, no public oral defense of the Master's thesis is required. Residency requirements specify a minimum of six quarters in residence at UCI for Ph.D. candidates and three quarters for M.S. candidates. Some faculty from the Department of Chemistry are mem\u00ad bers of an interdisciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemis\u00ad try group. The program provides an opportunity for interac\u00ad tion among graduate students and faculty from a number of UCI departments who share common interests in biophysics and biophysical chemistry. Participating graduate students pursue a degree in the department best suited to their own background and research interests. A program of seminars brings the group together monthly to discuss research prob\u00ad lems of mutual interest, and a regular series of interdiscipli\u00ad nary courses is offered by the participating faculty to provide formal instruction in areas encompassed by biophysics and biophysical chemistry. See page 70. The following lists specify requirements for each of the graduate programs offered by the Department of Chemistry.

Its activity is reflected in undergraduate and graduate courses which are responsive to new developments at the research frontier and the ever-changing requirements of government, industry, and education. The Department of Mathematics offers undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to fashion a thorough and soundly based pro\u00ad gram of study leading to professional competence in mathematical research, or in an area of application. The curriculum in mathematics includes opportunities for supervised individual study and research, and is augmented by seminars and colloquia. It is designed to be compatible with curricular structures at other collegiate institutions in California in order to enable students transferring to UCI to continue their programs of mathematics study. The Depart\u00ad ment maintains an LSI-11-based minicomputer and a number of programmable calculators that are available for student and faculty use and that supplement the campus Computing Facility. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Undergraduate mathematics courses are of several kinds: courses preparatory to advanced work in mathematics, the exact sciences, and engineering; coutses for students of the social and biological sciences; and courses for liberal arts stu\u00ad dents and those planning to enter the teaching field.

GRADUATE PROGRAM Graduate courses are designed to meet the needs of students doing graduate work in mathematics and in those disciplines that require graduate-level mathematics for their study. Among the fields covered are analysis, algebra, functional analysis, geometry and topology, probability and statistics, ordinary and partial differential equations, and mathematical logic. In addition to formal courses, there are seminars for advanced study toward the Ph.D. in various fields of mathe\u00ad matics. Topics will vary from year to year. Each seminar is conducted by a staff member specializing in the subject studied. Enrollment will be subject to the approval of the instructor in charge. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Master of Science in Mathematics The Master's program serves a dual purpose. For some stu\u00ad dents it will be a terminal program of mathematics education; for others it will lead to study and research at the doctoral level. To earn the Master of Science degree, the student must satisfy course, language, and residency requirements, and pass a comprehensive examination administered by the Graduate Studies Committee of the Department. There are three areas of concentration: Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Applied Mathematical Statistics. Each concentration requires the satisfactory completion of 12 upper-division or graduate courses; this includes a core of nine courses (36 units), in each of which the student must earn a grade of B (3.0) or better, and three elective courses (9 to 12 units). At least eight of these courses must be at the graduate level (200-series courses). The specific requirements are described below. A grade point average of at least B (3.0) is required for all courses applicable to the M.S. degree. The student's selection of alternative or elective courses must be approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. The nine required core courses for the Pure Mathematics concentration are Mathematics 210A-B-C, Mathematics 220A-B-C, and Mathematics 230A-B-C. The student must complete three additional approved courses, one of which must be an appropriate course offered by a department other than Mathematics. The nine required core courses for the Applied Mathematics concentration are Mathematics 210A-B-C, Mathematics 220A or 230A, Statistics (Mathematics 131A-B-C or 201A-B\u00ad C) or Differential Equations (Mathematics 142A-B-C or 295A-B-C), plus two additional graduate courses in Mathe\u00ad matics. The student must complete three additional approved courses, including two appropriate courses offered by a department other than Mathematics. The nine required core courses for the Applied Mathematical Statistics concentration are Mathematics 201A-B-C, Mathe\u00ad matics 202, Mathematics 204A-B, and three additional approved graduate courses in Mathematics or an appropriate applied area. The student also must complete Mathematics 129A-B-C. Ordinarily, the final examinations in the courses listed below will comprise the comprehensive examination for the Mas\u00ad ter's degree. Pure Mathematics: Mathematics 210C, Mathematics Applied 295C. Statistics: Mathematics ZOIC, Mathematics 202, and Mathematics 204B. The student must satisfy the language requirement for the Master's degree by demonstrating reading proficiency in French, German, or Russian; or by demonstrating program\u00ad ming proficiency in one higher level programming language. The residency requirement for the Master's degree ordinarily is satisfied by full-time enrollment for three quarters imme\u00ad diately preceding the award of the M.S. degree. When appropriate, a leave of absence may be granted between matriculation and the final quarters of study. Ph.D. in Mathematics To be admitt~d to the doctoral program in Mathematics, an applicant must have completed a Master's degree in Mathe\u00ad matics with distinction. Mathematics 151 When accepted into the doctoral program, the student em\u00ad barks on a program of formal courses, seminars, and individ\u00ad ual study courses to prepare for the Ph.D. qualifying exami\u00ad nation and dissertation. A candidate for the Ph.D. should have both breadth and depth of knowledge. Breadth is dem\u00ad onstrated by advanced knowledge and competence in algebra and analysis. Depth of knowledge is demonstrated by pro\u00ad found familiarity with a well-defined subject in mathematics, e.g., Banach algebras, categorical algebra, group theory, oper\u00ad ator theory, probability theory, or topology. After an appropriate period of advanced study, the Graduate Studies Committee will invite the student to prepare for the qualifying examination (or recommend that the student withdraw from the program). This decision will be reached after consultation with the student's faculty advisor and a review of the instructors' evaluations of the student's per\u00ad formance in courses and seminars. To prepare for the qualify\u00ad ing examination, the student should study, in depth, two top\u00ad ics selected with the approval of the Graduate Studies Committee. The oral qualifying examination is conducted by a candidacy committee, appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research on behalf of the Graduate Council, including at least one member of the faculty outside of the Mathematics Department. Following a successful examination, the com\u00ad mittee recommends admission of the student to candidacy for the Ph.D. The Ph.D. in Mathematics requires a demonstration of the ability to read the literature of mathematics in two of these languages: French, German, or Russian; ilnd the ability to program in a higher level programming language. Teaching experience and training is an integral part of the Ph.D. program. All doctoral students are expected to partici\u00ad pate in the teaching program of the Department. The candidate must demonstrate independent, creative re\u00ad search in mathematics by writing and defending a disserta\u00ad tion that makes a new and valuable contribution to mathe\u00ad matics in the candidate's area of concentration. Following advancement to candidacy, a doctoral committee, appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research on behalf of the Graduate Council, guides and supervises the candidate's research, study, and writing of the dissertation; conducts an oral defense of the dissertation; and recommends that the Ph.D. be conferred upon approval of the doctoral dissertation.

Physicists study the smallest structure of matter (quarks, nuclei, and atoms); the properties of solids, liquids, gases, and plasmas; the behavior of matter on the grand scale in stars and galaxies; and even the origin and fate of the universe. Other disci\u00ad plines such as chemistry, biology, medicine, and engineering often build upon the foundations laid by physics. In the past century applications of phenomena encountered in the field of physics have led to more changes in our lifestyle than have occurred in the previous millenium. These changes have brought us a \"high\" standard of living on one hand, and a threat of societal extinction on the other. The knowledge. gained in physical studies has affected our daily life, our view of life, our philosophies, and our religions. A subject of so great and general an influence is not only of interest to the specialist but should be understood in its scope, power, and promise for the future by every educated person. The Department offers courses for students of various inter\u00ad ests, from those in the liberal arts to those in engineering and other sciences. Faculty members are conducting active research in several forefront areas of physical research, and there is student access to specialized research areas such as elementary particles, plasma physics, and condensed matter at both advanced and undergraduate course levels. Instruc\u00ad tion varies in approach from traditional lecture courses to seminars at various levels, to independently constructed pro\u00ad grams, and to experimental computer teaching. The faculty is generally young, innovative, and engaged in everything from the traditional activities of research, education, and univer\u00ad sity service to community action, literature, and national pol\u00ad icy making, to mention a few examples. The Department encourages student-faculty interaction, and faculty members lead the lower-division discussion sections. The Department consists of people committed to intellectual activities and is exciting to those who are so inclined. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Courses in the Physics Department are designed to meet the needs of many kinds of students, from those students with\u00ad out facility in mathematics whose main interests lie in the humanities or the arts to those students with professional goals in science and engineering. In addition to the regular Physics major, a concentration in Applied Physics and a con\u00ad centration in Biomedical Physics are offered. The three lower-division sequences in physics are disting\"uished by their intended audience, their mathematical prerequisites, and the extent to which they offer preparation for more advanced courses. These aspects of the beginning courses are summar\u00ad ized in the following table: Physics 3 Physics 5 Intended Audience Premedical students, Physics, Chemistry, Biological Sciences and Engineering majors majors Mathematical Prerequisites Algebra and trigo- Math 2A (Calcu- nometry; concurrent Ius); knowledge enrollment in of computer pro- Math 2 gramming is recommended Preparation for Advanced Courses Physics SC with All upper-division permission courses in physics Physics 10-24 Non science majors None None Physics 155 UC IRVINE - 1982-1983156 Physics Requirements for Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 12. School Requirements: See page 142. Departmental Requirements Physics SA-B-C-0-E with laboratory; Physics lllA-B, 112A\u00ad B, 113A-B, and 115; two quarters of advanced laboratory (Physics ISO-IS3); Mathematics 2A-B-C (or H2A-B-C); Mathematics 3A-B-C; three courses from llOA-B-C 140A-B-C 142A-B-C or 144A-B with Physics llOA-B-C particularly recommended; and three additional coherently related upper-division courses chosen from the Schools of Physical Sciences, Biological Sciences, Engineering, or the Department of Information and Computer Science. Students should be aware that alternative programs can be developed to meet their special interests and that graduate courses can be used to satisfy undergraduate requirements. Applied Physics Requirements The requirements of the concentration in Applied Physics include all the requirements of the Physics degree plus six courses in engineering approved by the Physics Department. One quarter of the advanced laboratory requirement may be waived with appropriate engineering laboratory work. Biomedical Physics Requirements The requirements of the concentration in Biomedical Physics include the requirements of the Physics degree, except as noted below, plus the following: Biological Sciences 101, 103, and 104 with associated laboratories; Chemistry IA-B-C with laboratory; a three or four quarter sequence of courses in a specific area. Suggested sequences are as follows: 1. Chemistry SlA-B with laboratory; Biological Sciences 106 and 107 2. Biological Sciences lOS plus two Psychobiology courses 3. Chemistry 130A-B-C 4. Radiological Sciences 200A-B plus one additional Radio\u00ad logical Science course Approval must be obtained from the program coordinator. Sequences other than those above may be acceptable. The Sample Programs -Physics requirement for three additional coherently related upper\u00ad division science courses does not apply to students in this concentration. Planning a Program of Study Physics 3 is a one-year course suitable for premedical stu\u00ad dents, students majoring in Biological Sciences, and non\u00ad science majors. It surveys most of the important branches of physics with strong orientation toward modern physics. Laboratory work accompanies the course. Nonscience majors with some mathematical skill may wish to consider Physics 3 as an alternative to Physics 10-24. A student who decides to major in Physics after completing Physics 3 with a grade of A orB may, with the consent of the Department, enroll in Physics SC. The premedical physics requirements may be met with Physics 3 or with Physics SA-B-C. Physics Sis an intensive five-quarter course for students in physics, chemistry, engineering, and other areas interested in a careful quantitative approach to the subject. Laboratory work accompanies the course. Students expecting to enroll in the entire five-quarter sequence of Physics S should enroll in Mathematics 3A concurrently with Physics SC. Students planning to enroll in only three quarters of Physics Sneed not enroll in Mathematics 3A. The recommended knowledge of computer programming may be gained by enrolling in Information and Computer Science IA or IB, usually in the fall quarter of the freshman year, or in Physics I. Biological Sciences majors with facility in calculus should consider Phys\u00ad ics S as an alternative to Physics 3. Physics courses numbered between 10 and 24 are general education courses intended for nonscience majors. Physics 13A-B is particularly oriented toward students in Social Ecol\u00ad ogy. The content and format of Physics 21-24 will vary from year to year. In general, these courses will not include regular laboratory work. . Courses numbered 110 and above are for Physics majors and other qualified students. This series of courses in the upper\u00ad division curriculum is sufficiently broad to provide programs both for the Physics major who does not intend to pursue the A typical course program for Physics majors considering the possibility of graduate study in physics or astronomy is shown below. Three of the electives in the senior year may be physics graduate courses. A student with a weak back\u00ad ground may want to postpone Physics 113A-B-C until the senior year.

The Physics major with a career goal in medicine, law, teaching, or business, for example, should emphasize the Physics 130 series, which covers most of the important phenomena of physics. The Physics major preparing for graduate work in physics should cover most of the Physics 110 series. Any major who is so inclined can take more than the minimum two quarters of advanced laboratory work. Able students may begin the Physics l11 series in their sophomore year. Courses numbered between llO and l16 emphasize the mathematical and theoretical structures that have unified our understanding of nature. Those numbered between 130 and 149 emphasize particular domains of the structure of matter. Laboratory work is assigned to separate courses, 150-154. Transfer students are specifically advised to seek individual consultation with a member of the Physics faculty before deciding on a program of courses. Since many graduate physics departments require a reading knowledge of one foreign language, Physics majors planning graduate work should, if possible, study some Russian, Ger\u00ad man, or French. Introductory courses in biology and chemis\u00ad try are also recommended options. Every Physics major should avoid overspecialization and wisely use undergraduate years to explore some areas remote from physics. Physics majors with interests other than graduate work in physics or astronomy need not take as many physics courses as indicated above. Note also that alternatives to Physics major requirements can be approved upon petition to the Department and the Office of the Associate Dean. As a guide to preparing a suitable program, the Department makes the following suggestions: Physics majors considering the possibility of graduate school in engineering should complete the Applied Physics requirements. The course program of Physics majors considering graduate work in chemistry, biology, or various interdisciplinary areas should contain: Chemistry 1A-B-C and 51A-B-C and Biological Sciences 101, 103, and 104. The concentration in Biomedical Physics is offered for Phys\u00ad ics majors who wish to follow an integrated program which combines biology and/or chemistry with physics, and is suit\u00ad able preparation for a graduate career in one of these inter\u00ad disciplinary areas. The course program of Physics majors considering a teaching career in the public schools or the community colleges should contain: Education 171 and 170, or 172; and additional preparation in some other area of science or mathematics. Courses from the Physics 10-24 sequence may be appropriate. The 'course program of Physics majors considering graduate work in the history of science should contain at least: History 29A-B-C. Courses from the Physics 10-24 sequence may be appropriate. Sample Program -Applied Physics The Applied Physics concentration within the Physics under\u00ad graduate degree program is designed to provide appropriate education to students who anticipate a career in industrial or technological research. It combines the fundamental knowl\u00ad edge of physical processes obtained from physics courses Physics 157 with the technical knowledge obtained from engineering courses, particularly electrical engineering courses. In addi\u00ad tion to the basic courses in physics, a student is required to complete six courses in the School of Engineering approved by the Physics Department. Examples of appropriate courses include completion of the Applied Physics concentration, the student will receive a B.S. degree in Physics. A typical course program for Physics majors in the Applied Physics concentration differs .from the Physics major pro\u00ad gram primarily in the junior and senior years. Engineering EE75 should be completed before the junior year. Fall Winter Spring Junior Physics 110A Physics lllA Engr. EE113 Planning -Biomedical Physics l12B Physics Physics 133 Elective Engr. EE178 The Biomedical Physics concentration is designed for the stu\u00ad dent who anticipates a career in physics applied to biology and medicine, such as health physics or radiological physics, or who intends to work in a scholarly field which deals with the physical aspects of biology or medicine, such as molecular biology or physiology. Completion of requirements for the Physics major is required, except as noted in the Biomedical Physics requirements, as are six quarters of basic courses in biology and chemistry (see table). A sequence of three or four integrated additional courses which must be approved by the program coordinator com\u00ad pletes the program. Students who wish to follow the Biomed\u00ad ical Physics concentration are advised to seek guidance early in their college careers. The requirements are such that coor\u00ad dination of a program in the first and second years is essential.

In general, graduate study in physics is expected to be a full\u00ad time activity. Other proposed arrangements should be approved by the Graduate Committee. Complementing the formal courses, the Department offers regular colloquia and informal seminars. The graduate stu\u00ad dent is a member of an intellectual community and is expected to participate fully in departmental activities. Attendance at colloquia is considered an essential part of graduate study. In addition, there are regular weekly research seminars in condensed matter, high energy, and plasma physics. About 60 graduate students of physics were enrolled in I98I-82. Active programs of research are underway in high energy physics, condensed matter physics, low temperature physics, plasma physics, mathematical physics, and astrophysics. Sources of support available to graduate students include teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and fellowships. Students planning to pursue graduate work in physics should obtain a copy of the booklet Physiml Sciences from the Department. Master of Science in Physics The requirements for the M.S. degree are: (I) at least three quarters of residence; and (2) mastery of graduate course material, which may be demonstrated either (a) by passing, with a grade of B or better, a minimum of nine quarter courses numbered between 200 and 259, including 211, 2I3A~B, 2I4A, and 2I5A-B, and a written comprehensive examination; or (b) by passing the Ph.D. qualifying examina\u00ad tion. Under special circumstances, a research project and the\u00ad sis may be accepted in lieu of proficiency in some of the graduate course material. There is no foreign language requirement for the M.S. degree. In addition to the stated course requirements, all students who have not passed the Ph.D. qualifying examination must register continuously for Physics 264A-B-C (Seminar in Conceptual Physics). A typical program in preparation for the written examination for the M.S. degree would consist of I2 courses: 211 (Classical Mechanics) 2I2A-B (Mathematical Physics) 2I3A-B (Electromagnetic Theory) 2I4A-B (Statistical Physics) 2I5A-B (Quantum Mechanics) Three electives chosen from Physics 2I2C. 2I4C, 2I5C, 2I6-2I9, or undergraduate upper-division courses in related areas. Doctor of Philosophy in Physics The principal requirements for the Ph.D. degree are a min\u00ad imum of six quarters of residence, passage of a written and a two-part oral examination, and successful completion and defense of a dissertation reporting results of original research. In addition, the Ph.D. candidate must complete cer\u00ad tain graduate course requirements. There is no foreign lan\u00ad guage requirement for the Ph.D. degree. Course Requirements. The student is required to exhibit mastery of the basic sequences, Mathematical Physics, Classi\u00ad cal Mechanics and Electromagnetic Theory, Quantum Mechanics, Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, and Statistical Mechanics. A minimum of IS quarter courses numbered between 200 and 259, including 211, 212A-B, 2I3A-B, 2I4A\u00ad B, and 2I5A-B, must be passed with a grade of B or better. In addition, all students who have not passed the Ph.D. qualify\u00ad ing examination are required to register for Physics 264A-B\u00ad C. It is expected that students, having selected a research specialty, will ordinarily take the core course in that subject (237 A-B-C, 238A-B-C, or 239A-B-C) early in their graduate career. Qualifying Examination. For advancement to Ph.D. candi\u00ad dacy, a student must pass a qualifying examination consisting of a written part and two oral parts. The written part covers a broad range of fundamentals of physics at the advanced undergraduate and graduate levels. The first part of the oral examination will be administered shortly after the written examination. All members of the first oral committee will be faculty from the Physics Department. The second part of the oral examination will be taken approximately one year after successful completion of the written examination and the first oral. The candidacy committee that administers the second oral examination will contain one or two faculty members from outside the Physics Department. The second oral will cover principally material related to the broad and general features of the student's dissertation area. The writ\u00ad ten portion of the qualifying examination will be given once per year, generally in the fall. The examination may be taken by some students after one year of graduate study. A second attempt will be permitted if the first is not successful. A third UC IRVINE - 1982-1983attempt will be permitted only in extraordinary circumstances. Teaching Program. Experience in teaching is an integral part of the graduate program, and all graduate students are expected to participate in the teaching program for at least three quarters d11ring their graduate careers. Dissertation. A dissertation summarizing the results oforig\u00ad inal research performed by the student under the supervision of a doctoral committee appointed by the Graduate Council . will be required for the Ph.D. degree. The criterion for the acceptability of a dissertation by the Department is that it be suitable for publication in a scientific journal. The disserta\u00ad tion must not have been submitted to any other institution prior to its submission to the Physics Department at UCI. Defense of Dissertation. Upon completion of the disserta\u00ad tion, the student will take an oral examination, open to the public, before the doctoral committee. Suggested Course Sequence. Typical programs for the first two years designed to prepare the student for Ph.D. qualifi\u00ad cation and provide the foundation necessary for understand\u00ad ing and participating in modern research might include: First Year: 211 (Relativistic Quantum Mechanics). In the second year of graduate study, the student may begin to take courses that will provide a broad background for the dissertation area. The following sequences represent a typical second-year program: For the student with an interest in condensed matter physics: 221 (Elasticity); 222 (Hydrodynamics); (Group Theory); 218 (Condensed Matter Physics); 220 (Plasma Physics). For the student with an interest in elementary particle physics: 235A-B (Advanced Quantum Mechanics); 232B (Group (Astrophysics); 214A-B (Statistical Physics); 214C (Many Body Theory) or 218 (Condensed Matter Physics).

Yellott, Jr., Ph.D. Stanford University, Professor of Psychology UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Social Sciences 163 UC IRVINE - 1982-1983164 Social Sciences Undergraduate and graduate education in the School of Social Sciences at UCI represents a commitment to modern social science. The classic subject matter areas of anthropol\u00ad ogy, economics, geography, linguistics, political science, psy\u00ad chology, and sociology are included in the School's educa\u00ad tional programs, but these programs go well beyond the traditional disciplines and can be characterized by the follow\u00ad ing three-way emphasis: First, the faculty recognizes the value of systematic empirical observation and quantitative analysis in the study of human behavior. Developments in computer science and in mathe\u00ad matics oriented toward the problems of the social sciences and the refinement of techniques for the observational, experimental, and statistical study of human behavior have contributed major new elements to social science. Students in the School of Social Sciences will become familiar with the mathematical, computational, and statistical tools underlying modern social science. Second, many of the most interesting questions in the study of human behavior cannot be fixed within the traditional dis\u00ad ciplinary boundaries. Some of the new and evolving areas which cross orthodox boundaries are political sociology, pub\u00ad lic policy, cognitive anthropology, comparative culture, and psycholinguistics. Therefore, many courses and course modules are built around social science phenomena, rather than representing social science disciplines. Third, the School shares the academic philosophy that con\u00ad siders the design of hypotheses and of systems of interrelated ideas about the possible structure of the world to be an essential part of scientific pursuit. Consequently, the educa\u00ad tional programs place substantial emphasis on understanding social science phenomena through the development of the\u00ad ories that can be used to guide empirical studies. Opportunities for students in the School of Social Sciences to participate in the educational process extend well beyond attendance at courses. Students may develop independent study proposals in cooperation with interested faculty members; they are invited to participate in the quarterly eval\u00ad uation of courses and instructors, to propose new courses and other modifications in existing programs, to nominate candidates for visiting faculty appointments, and to serve on School committees. The School provides a variety of oppor\u00ad tunities for faculty-student interaction, and students will find the faculty, administration, and academic counseling staff of the School highly accessible and responsive. Careers in Social Sciences Graduates of the School of Social Sciences find many, and diverse, career opportunities. Social Sciences graduates have been in demand for jobs in government, primary and secon\u00ad dary teaching, and human services, as well as for careers in business. Many Social Sciences graduates have gone on to further studies, some at the doctoral level in preparation for careers in research and university teaching, others in the pro\u00ad fessions of law and medicine, in education, and in business administration. Because all Social Sciences degrees involve an educational program that is interdisciplinary and that emphasizes quan\u00ad titative methods of data analysis, graduates of the School are well prepared for research and analysis positions in all levels of government and in private firms. Their firm grounding in contemporary social science methods and their familiarity with a broad spectrum of social scientific thinking gives them a fine background on the basis of which to pursue further training in graduate and professional programs. Special Facilities The School of Social Sciences maintains several special facili\u00ad ties for research and education. The Social Sciences Research Laboratory occupies the entire fourth floor of the Social Sci\u00ad ences Laboratory Building. The facility contains 40 experi\u00ad ment and control rooms situated around a central core where two PDP 11-44 computers are available for experimental research. The laboratory is used for faculty and student research. The Farm School, a small, open, and ungraded elementary school located in a rural setting adjacent to the campus, serves as a research facility for faculty and students having interests in children and how they learn. Each quarter under\u00ad graduates receive course credit for assisting staff teachers, for developing educational materials, and for observing and analyzing child behavior at the school. The Anthropology Laboratory provides research facilities which include computer terminals for statistical studies and for the analysis of texts and other verbal material. The labor\u00ad atory is also available for undergraduate and graduate instruction in field methodology and analytical techniques through the use of video-cassettes, films, tapes, computer quizzes, and artificial intelligence programs that simulate interviewing situations. The School also maintains a Video Laboratory where social science students and faculty can produce and edit video-tapes for various purposes. The facility currently contains a tape library used extensively in the study of conversation and interaction. Degrees Anthropology ......................................

Two upper-division courses in each of the following modules: A-Linguistics 110-119 series (same as Linguistics I40-149) E-Linguistics I50-I59 C. One year (three courses) in a single foreign language. Students are strongly urged to study a non-Indo-European language (such as Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Swa\u00ad hili) whenever available. In addition, students may elect a third linguistics track in Applied Linguistics. For information on the requirements for this track as well as those for General Linguistics when taken through the School of Humanities, see page I31. Political Science School requirements must be met and must include 11 courses (44 units) as specified below: A. Three introductory courses (I2 units) in political science, Social Sciences 6A-B-C. B. Two lower-division courses in political science (eight units). C. Six upper-division courses in political science (24 units). Three of these courses must form a module. Honors Program in Political Science: The honors program in Political Science, open to selected students, provides for advanced work in either of two areas: Theory and Research, or Internship and Research. Admission to the program is based on a formal application normally submitted during the fall quarter of the student's junior year. In order for an appli\u00ad cation to be considered, two conditions must be met. The student must have an overall grade point average of at least 3.2, and the student must have completed at least five politi\u00ad cal science courses (with a grade point average of 3.5 or higher) by the end of fall quarter of the junior year. Success\u00ad ful completion of the honors program requires attendance at the Honors Seminar, completion of an honors thesis, and the passing of an oral examination administered by three faculty members of the political science faculty. Psychology School requirements must be met and must include I5 courses (60 units) as specified below: A. Social Sciences 7. B. Two four-unit lower-division psychology courses selected from courses listed in the following three groups. The stu\u00ad dent is strongly encouraged to take courses from two differ\u00ad ent groups. Group A: Social Sciences 50Q; SOT; SIA. C. Social Sciences 2A or 2B, and 8, or approved substitutes (eight units). D. Ten four-unit upper-division courses with emphasis in psychology, distributed as follows: (I) Three courses (four or more units each) taken from one of the following modules: module or combina\u00ad tion of modules other than the module selected to satisfy (I) above. (3) Four additional four-unit upper-division psychology courses. These may be selected from any of the modules listed above, including the module used to satisfy (I), as well as from special topics courses which are psychology\u00ad related. Students are also encouraged to take psychology courses outside the School of Social Sciences if such courses are appropriate to their educational goals. Social Science Requirements for the B.A. degree in Social Science are met by completing the School requirements on page I64. Sociology School requirements must be met and must include II courses (44 units) as specified below: A. Social Sciences 8. B. Social Sciences 6IE. C. Two lower-division courses (eight units) that emphasize sociology. It is strongly recommended that students take one course on sociological methods (such as Social Sciences 6IC or IA) and one course on a special area of sociology (such as Social Sciences 6IB). D. Three upper-division courses (I2 units) that emphasize sociology. E. Four courses (I6 units) in social science disciplines outside sociology, or in history or social ecology. Three of these courses must be in the same field, e.g., three courses in eco\u00ad nomics or three in history. These courses may be upper-or lower-division. They may not be counted as part of the breadth requirement. Double Majors In order to double major within the School of Social Sciences, the following conditions must be met: (I) Normally, neither major program may be the general social science program. (2) Major and School requirements must be met for both majors with no overlap of courses except for those used to satisfy the mathematics, computer science, and introductory social science requirements. The mathematics and computer science courses need only be taken once. Only two introduc\u00ad tory social science classes are needed, provided this also meets the requirements of both major programs. The same two-digit and upper-division courses may not be used to meet the requirements of more than one major program. For example, a student who would like to major in psychology and anthropology may take one of the mathematics se\u00ad quences, Information and Computer Science I, and may use Introduction to Psychology and Introduction to Anthropol\u00ad ogy to meet the major and School requirements for both programs. However, two different sets of two-digit and upper-division courses must be taken to complete the major and School requirements of the two programs. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Transfer Students Freshmen and Sophomores: Students transferring to UCI as freshmen or sophomores will fulfill the regular requirements of the four-year program either through work at UCI or through transfer credit for comparable work elsewhere. Juniors: Junior transfers electing to major in one of the School's degree programs and with good records at other ac\u00ad credited colleges and universities normally will be presumed to have satisfied School requirement B and the University re\u00ad quirements, with the exception of the upper-division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I). Stu\u00ad dents anticipating transfer to UCI in their junior year, how\u00ad ever, should plan their programs so as to anticipate the spe\u00ad cial mathematics requirements of the program (School requirement A). Every effort will be made to accommodate individual variation in background, provided students are prepared to commit themselves to intensive work in areas of deficiency. Ordinarily, the typical two-year program for jun\u00ad ior transfers is simply the last two years of the regular four\u00ad year program, except that students who have not satisfied the mathematics requirements of the School should plan to do so in the junior year and must do so before graduation. Seniors: Students wishing to graduate with a degree in the . Sch.ool by transferring to UCI in their senior year should plan the1r work carefully to ensure that the requirements can be met in one year of residence. In general, differences between the program at UCI and programs elsewhere make senior transfers difficult. The 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Students who are interested in a career in administration and who have completed all of the course requirements for the B.A. degree in one of the major programs in the School of Social Sciences may apply to the Graduate School of Man\u00ad agement for their 3-2 Program. Application should be made early in the junior year. During the senior year, students will take courses in management which will count toward the 180 total units needed to receive a bachelor's degree. Upon suc\u00ad cessful completion of the required courses and units, usually at the conclusion of four years of undergraduate study, a B.A. degree will be awarded in the student's major by the School of Social Sciences. A Master's degree in Business Administration, Public Administration, or Business and Pub\u00ad lic Administration will be awarded after successful comple\u00ad tiOn of all requirements for the advanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. Honors Concentration in Social Thought The School of Humanities and the School of Social Sciences offer an honors concentration in Social Thought. The con\u00ad centration offers undergraduates the opportunity to examine major social theories and their implications in a systematic and thorough way. For a complete description of the concen\u00ad tration, see page 128. Concentration in Women's Studies The Women's Studies concentration is not a major but is intended to allow a student to complement any major in the School of Humanities, the School of Social Sciences, or the Program in Social Ecology by the systematic study of women in culture and society. For further information on the con\u00ad centration, see page 129. Anthropology and Linguistics Historically there have been close ties between anthropology and linguistics. In the past, many linguists were originally trained as anthropologists, and many anthropologists have focused their research on aspects of linguistic structure. Lin-Social Sciences 167 guists who work on unfamiliar languages benefit from train\u00ad ing in anthropological field methods and elicitation techniques. Recommended courses for those majors in Anthropology who have a special interest in language, and for majors in Linguistics with a special interest in anthropology are the fol\u00ad lowing: Social Sciences 20, 3 (or Linguistics 50), 101G-H, 132B, 136B, 141A, 141F, Linguistics 110 and 133. For the lin\u00ad guistically oriented Anthropology major, the basic courses in linguistic structures (syntax, phonology, and semantics) are essential, while the Anthropology courses in collection and analysis of data are essential to the Linguistics major with an interest in field work. To complete a major in Anthropology or Linguistics, both School and major requirements must be completed. Planning a Program of Study Since there are many alternative ways to plan a program, some of which may require careful attention to specific major requirements, students should consult with their assigned faculty advisors or visit the Undergraduate Advising Office (122 Social Science Tower) to design an appropriate program of study. \u00b7 Students who elect one of the Social Sciences majors in their freshman year might begin by taking the one-digit courses required by their major and one of the mathematics se\u00ad quences listed under Part A of the Scho.ol requirements. It is a good idea to take these courses early since they include fundamental concepts that will be widely applicable in more advanced courses. In addition, the lower-division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) should be completed during the first year. In the sophomore year, the student might complete the course on computing, three courses toward the breadth requirement, four courses in the social sciences, and four electives. Students who are planning to go on to graduate school can use their freshman and sophomore years to advantage by taking courses in theory, research methods, mathematics, and other areas important to graduate study. In the junior and senior years, the student should take courses in the major area and should create an individualized program of study through a combination of courses and course modules which fall in an area of interest. Particular attention should be paid to planning a program of study that will ensure that major requirements are met prior to graduation. Teaching Credentials Students planning to seek State of California teaching cre\u00ad dentials in social science should discuss their undergraduate curriculum plans with the School's academic counselors. Stu\u00ad dents completing any of the B.A. programs in the School qualify for a waiver of the Single Subject Credential Exami\u00ad nation in social science. For additional information about teaching credentials, see the Teacher Education section. Mathematics and Social Science The mathematics requirement stems from the nature of modern social science. The concepts and terms of mathemat\u00ad ics, statistics, and computers are an important part of the social scientist's vocabulary. Basic knowledge of these tools is necessary to an understanding of current literature in these fields, to the analysis of data, and to an intelligent use of models in social sciences. Each candidate for a degree in the School of Social Sciences is expected to have a basic knowl\u00ad edge of probability, statistics, and computing. In addition, for students who are preparing for graduate school in an area of UC IRVINE - 1982-1983168 Social Sciences social science, it will be important to supplement the minimal mathematics requirements with additional courses related to mathematics and social science methodology. The particular courses which would be recommended are not specified here, however, since they are highly dependent on the major emphasis of the student. Students who are preparing for graduate study should consult their advisors to determine a program of study which will give them the research skills necessary for successful graduate work. GRADUATE PROGRAMS Graduate education within the School of Social Sciences is focused upon Cognitive Sciences; Comparative Culture; Poli\u00ad tics, Society, and Social Issues; and Social Relations (including anthropology). Doctoral students may be admitted to one of four established groups which offer graduate study: Cogni\u00ad tive Sciences, leading to the Ph.D. in Psychology; tive Culture, leading to the Ph.D. in Comparative Culture; Politics, Society, and Social Issues, leading to the Ph.D. in Political Science; and Social Relations, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science. When the interests of the student lie outside of the areas encompassed by the recognized groups, the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, School of Social Sci\u00ad ences, may appoint a faculty committee of at least three mem\u00ad bers to guide an independent course of study leading to the Ph.D. degree in Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science. Faculty members with shared interests are develop\u00ad ing new areas of emphasis, incluging Culture and Health Practices, Economics and Public Policy, and Networks. Graduate study is also offered leading to the Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) degree in Comparative Culture. Although the School does not offer other programs leading to a Master of Arts degree, the M.A. degree in Comparative Culture or Social Science may be conferred upon doctoral students who satisfy the requirements of the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. Admissions Potential graduate students should apply to the Division of Graduate Studies and Research for admission to the graduate program of the School of Social Sciences, indicating the title of the degree which they intend to pursue (Ph.D. in Compar\u00ad ative Culture, Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science), and the academic area in which they expect to concentrate. In addition to the Division admission requirements, each group may prescribe special requirements or expectations of appli\u00ad cants. All applicants are required to submit scores for the Graduate Record Examination Aptitude Test. Letters of recommendation are an important factor in the admission decision. The Program in Comparative Culture admits new graduate students only for the fall quarter of even-numbered years. Financial Aid Limited financial support in the form of teaching assistant\u00ad ships and fellowships is available to qualified students. There may be research assistantships available under grants to indi\u00ad vidual faculty. Students are expected to seek aid for which they are eligible from sources external to the University. General Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree in Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science The general requirements for the Ph.D. in Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science (in addition to those which apply to all UCI graduate students) are summarized below. Each recognized group within the School of Social Sciences may describe additional requirements, subject to the approval of the Graduate Council. Length of Study The faculty envisions a student's Ph.D. program to be of ap\u00ad proximately four to five years duration. Residence Because the intellectual training the School proposes requires full-time study and constant contact with the faculty, the School does not accept part-time students. Language A knowledge of one foreign language, appropriate to the stu\u00ad dent's research concerns, is required. Each student's group or candidacy committee will prescribe specific requirements. For those proposing to engage in field research, this may involve interviewing capabilities. Quantitative Methods Candidates for the Ph.D. degrees in Social Science, Political Science, or Psychology must satisfy a quantitative methods requirement. This may be met by (1) satisfaction of the quantitative methods requirement of the student's group, or (2) completion of two years of college-level mathematics, sta\u00ad tistics, logic, or applications of statistics to social science research problems, in courses approved by the student's group or committee. In the latter option, courses may include one computer science course; ordinarily at least one year of these quantitative methods courses will be taken during the student's graduate career. Examinations The scope and format of the qualifying examinations will be determined by the student's candidacy committee. These examinations may be written or oral, or both, and usually will be conducted after approximately two years of residence. Also, a student may be required to take additional examina\u00ad tions, submit research papers, or conduct experiments which the committee deems appropriate to the student's interests and goals. Upon satisfactory completion of the qualifying examinations, and approval of the dissertation topic, the can\u00ad didacy committee will recommend that the student be advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Dissertation Following advancement to candidacy, the dissertation is supervised by a doctoral committee ordinarily consisting of three members of the candidacy committee. The purpose of the dissertation is to demonstrate the student's ability to orig\u00ad inate interesting and significant research problems, to inves\u00ad tigate such problems both broadly and deeply, and to write scholarly material of publishable quality.

Wexler: Theoretical Psycholinguistics John I. Yellott, Jr.: Mathematical Models and Visual Perception The Cognitive Sciences group is made up of certain faculty of the School of Social Sciences and graduate students who are UC IRVINE - 1982-1983pursuing the Ph.D. in Psychology, all of whom share com\u00ad mon research interests in human cognition. The Cognitive Sciences group is concerned with how the human mind works. It conducts research and provides advanced graduate training in cognitive psychology and theo\u00ad retical linguistics. The group lays special stress on precise, scientific approaches to issues in human cognition. It views the formation of formal models as instrumental in under\u00ad standing what the human mind is all about. The group takes as its intellectual domain the following: mathematical psychology, perception (visual and auditory), cognitive development, problem solving, learning, memory, psycholinguistics, iconics, and theoretical linguistics. It does not emphasize traditional training in psychology or linguistics per se; rather, it stresses the integrati.on of research in the areas mentioned above (and related areas) into a discipline whose central focus is the study of human knowledge and human information processing, regardless of the medium in which it is expressed. Admissions In addition to meeting the general requirements for admis\u00ad sion, applicants should have acquired a background in mathematics equivalent to at least one year of calculus. Advanced courses in some of the following fields are con\u00ad sidered highly desirable: computer science, mathematics and the physical sciences, biology, logic, and linguistics. Each admission application will be considered on its own merits. Requirements Each student is expected to take two three-course graduate sequences. The first is a three-quarter methods sequence covering the areas of probability and statistics, experimental design, and mathematical models of language. The other is a proseminar sequence covering areas such as learning, memory, perception, and linguistics. Suitable substitutes may be made with written approval of the group. Additional advanced course work in other fields relevant to the student's interests will supplement the required courses. Each student is expected to carry out theoretical/empirical research during the first two years. By the end of the second year, each student should complete a research project of a scope and nature that potentially could be published in a rele\u00ad vant journal. The student's advisor is responsible for assisting in the planning and other facets of the project. Students are expected to write a paper based on their research and to present a talk to the \"Cognitive Sciences Seminar\" or another appropriate forum by the end of the spring quarter of their second full year in the graduate program. Reviews At the end of each academic year, the faculty in the group will meet to discuss the progress of each of its students and to provide feedback on the progress and perceived deficien\u00ad cies for each student. The advancement-to-candidacy examination will consist of an oral examination and possibly a written examination as well. Normally this step will be completed by the end of the third or beginning of the fourth year of the program. The exami\u00ad nation will be based on the student's dissertation proposal. If the student should fail the examination the first time, there will be, at most, one additional opportunity to take the exam\u00ad ination. A student who fails the examination twice will be asked to withdraw. Prior to submission of the final version of the dissertation the student will be expected to defend the dissertation in a public colloquium.

White: Anthropology, Social Networks and Relations, Cross-Cultural Comparison, Mathematical Models of Social Constraints, Decision-Making Networks and Social Processes Joseph L. White: Black Psychology, Community Mental Health, Child Development, and Psychotherapy The doctoral program in Comparative Culture emphasizes study centering on the cultures of the United States, includ\u00ad ing dominant and minority cultures and their antecedents. The program is designed to educate interdisciplinary intellec\u00ad tuals, teachers, and research scholars. The range of cultures found in America is studied on a comparative basis, with some students concentrating upon the expressive forms of culture (literature, religion, myth, and the arts) and others on culture from the perspective of social inquiry (history and the social sciences). However, all students will gain interdiscipli\u00ad nary training as comparative analysts in both broad areas. Finally, the program is intended to prepare graduate students for academic positions in interdisciplinary programs as well as in departments of humanities and social sciences. Admission Requirements and standards for admission into the program are in keeping with those of the University of California as a whole. Students with a B.A. degree will be considered for admission on the basis of past academic performance and present academic interests. In addition to the general applica\u00ad tion material, Graduate Record Examination Aptitude Test scores are required. Applicants who are admitted to the pro\u00ad gram begin their study in the fall quarter of the academic year. The deadline for applications is February 1. The pro\u00ad gram admits new graduate students only for the fall quarter of even-numbered years. Residence Although the University residence requirement for the Ph.D. is a minimum of six quarters, doctoral students in Compara\u00ad tive Culture must complete three years of course work (108 units). Normally, three courses (12 units) will be completed per quarter. Required and Elective Courses The program requires 21 courses (84 units for the doctorate). Courses are selected in consultation with the academic ad\u00ad visor, to prepare the student for the comprehensive first-year examination, the qualifying examination, and the develop\u00ad ment of a dissertation topic. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983170 Social Sciences The Proseminar in Expressive Forms (Social Science 2 70A-B) and ,I he Proseminar in Social Inquiry (Social Science 2 7 3A-B) are required of all first-year graduate students. In addi.tion each student must enroll in five approved electives. Electives may be taken in Comparative Culture or other areas pertinent to the program. During the second year, a course sequence in Nondominant American Classes and Cultures (Social Science 274A-B) is required of all doctoral students. For students emphasizing Social Inquiry, Cross-Cultural Comparisons, a methodological sequence (Social Science 275A-B-C) is also required while Expressive Forms students must complete a methodologies sequence (Social Science 276A-B-C) or approved alternative courses. Each second-year student must enroll in four approved electives totaling 16 additional units. During the third year, all doctoral students must enroll in three approved electives (12 units). All graduate students, including Teaching Assistants and Associates, are expected to enroll for a minimum of 12 units of academic credit (ordinarily, three courses) each quarter. Any student who wishes to take more than four courses (16 units) must petition the Graduate Committee and gain approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Incomplete grades will not be assigned for year-long courses except in extenuating circumstances. Credit for Previous Academic Work Students entering with an M.A. degree may request credit for a maximum of nine courses (36 units). These courses might be accepted in lieu of electives. A written petition requesting an acceptance of previous work in lieu of electives should be made to the Graduate Committee after consulta\u00ad tion with the academic advisor. Approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research is required. Language Requirements One foreign language and one \"alternate skill\" are required. The language will be decided upon by the student in consul\u00ad tation with the advisor. The language requirement must be satisfied either through a standard ETS examination or by another method approved by the Graduate Committee. The \"alternate skill\" may be another language, or a sequence of two courses in statistics, linguistics, or computer science, or some acceptable skill from the arts which is necessary for research. Both the language and the alternate skill must be satisfied before the qualifying examination can be taken. Comprehensive First-Year Examination Prior to the commencement of class work for the fall quarter, second-year doctoral students are administered a comprehen\u00ad sive examination which covers the materials from the two proseminars offered during the first year, including reading lists provided in those seminars. An ad hoc examination committee appointed by the Chair reads the examinations. It is possible for students who fail this examination to take it a second time. A second failure results in academic disqualifica\u00ad tion and no degree will be awarded. A student who passes the first or second examination may be awarded the M.A. degree. On the basis of students' performance in courses and on the compreh~nsive examination, the program faculty will decide which students to invite to continue studies toward the Ph.D. degree. Master of Arts Degree Those doctoral students who pass the first-year comprehen\u00ad sive examination but do not continue beyond that point, or those who have passed the Ph.D. Qualifying Examination, may be awarded the Master of Arts degree by (a) completing 36 units (nine courses), 24 units (six courses) of which must be in Comparative Culture and 12 units (three courses) of which are approved electives in Comparative Culture or a related area; and (b) demonstrating proficiency in a second language or an alternate skill. The Ph.D. Qualifying Examination Doctoral students are administered two examinations, one written and one oral. The written examination is scheduled after the completion of course work and language require\u00ad ments. The student's committee, formed by the Chair of the Graduate Committee in consultation with the student, is responsible for formulating the examination questions. The examination will be based on program courses and electives taken by the student during the second and third years. The entire program faculty can be called upon to submit questions for the examination, and the entire faculty will read the examinations. If the student passes the examination, the stu\u00ad dent will then be advanced to the oral examination. The oral examination follows successful completion of the written examination by two weeks or less and is conducted by a can\u00ad didacy committee (normally the student's advisory commit\u00ad tee) appointed in the name of the Graduate Council. This committee normally consists of five members of the UCI Academic Senate or persons with equivalent qualifications, and will include at least one member who does not hold a faculty appointment in Comparative Culture. The committee recommends advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. if the candidate successfully completes the oral examination. Students who fail the written examination may, upon peti\u00ad tion, take it a second time. Two failures result in academic disqualification. The Dissertation The final requirement for the Ph.p. degree is completion of a dissertation which is approved by the doctoral committee appointed by the Graduate Council. Master of Arts in Teaching in Comparative Culture This graduate degree program is designed primarily for those who want to pursue a career in education at the elementary, secondary, or community college level. M.A.T. students may work concurrently toward a California Teaching Credential, or may be experienced teachers who wish to upgrade their professional preparation. Based upon an interdisciplinary and comparative framework embracing the range of cultures found in the United States, the M.A.T. prepares its graduates to teach and facilitate the development of multicultural studies in several subject areas. Specifically, our M.A.T. pro\u00ad gram focuses on the study of Comparative Culture with a special concentration in literature, history, and social sciences relating to various ethnic groups of America. These emphases will be framed by the students' interests and needs with respect to their career goals in the field of education. Since the M.A.T. and Ph.D. programs in Comparative Cul\u00ad ture have different goals, the students in the M.A.T. program are not automatically advanced to doctoral training. Students who wish to pursue the doctoral degree in Comparative Cul\u00ad ture must apply to the Graduate Committee of Comparative Culture. Admissions Applications for admission to the M.A.T. program are made through Comparative Culture. Residence The minimum residence requirement for the M.A.T. is three quarters. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Required and Elective Courses In addition to the courses which may be required for the cre\u00ad dential, the M.A.T. program consists of at least nine courses (36 units), six of which must be at the graduate level. Required courses include Multicultural Foundations of Edu\u00ad cation, a three-quarter core course; Pluralism, Public Policy, and the Schools, a two-quarter review and analysis of public policy; Special Topics, a one-quarter seminar concerned with a specific theme of relevance to the multicultural dimension of public education; and Thesis Research and Analysis, a one\u00ad quarter seminar. The student will develop and carry out an appropriate project in the teaching of ethnic cultures and/or minority students, and submit a report of the project demon\u00ad strating an integration of theoretical knowledge and applied skills for the approval of the thesis committee. Language Requirement For those who are recommended to acquire proficiency in a second language or alternate skills pertinent to cultural edu\u00ad cation, additional courses may be required. POLITICS, SOCIETY, AND SOCIAL ISSUES James Danziger: Urban Political Systems, Public Policy Analysis, and Technology and Politics David Easton: Political Systems, Political Structures Harry Eckstein: Macropolitics and Authority Relations Creel Froman: Human Analysis Bernard Grofman: Mathematical Models of Collective Decision Making, Formal Democratic Theory, Sequential Decision Mak\u00ad ing, and Politics of Small Groups Julius Margolis: Economic Analysis of Government Behavior M.

Members are committed to studies involving the application of social science theory to the solu\u00ad tion of social issues. The Ph.D. is granted in Political Science. The group places special emphasis on recruiting students who propose to pursue research in the following areas: (a) authority, power, and value allocations-relating to public policy, to organization, to participation, and to relationships within and between social and political units; (b) change and structure of cultures and of social and political units; and (c) empirical theory, mathematical models, and quantitative analysis of political phenomena. Faculty are currently conducting research on authority rela\u00ad tions, organizational theory, and bureaucratic behavior; eco\u00ad nomic models of political behavior; mass media and society; democracy and participation; public policy; political thought; quantitative political science; foreign policy and international relations; and comparative politics with an emphasis on Europe and Latin America. Two University research institutes affiliated with the group through joint faculty appointments-the Institute of Trans-Social Sciences 171 UC IRVINE - 1982-1983172 Social Sciences portation Studies and the Public Policy Research Organiza\u00ad tion-are located at the University of California, Irvine. Both sponsor theoretical and applied research on social issues. They also may provide research funding for graduate stu\u00ad dents who select public policy or transportation as a special\u00ad ized field. Admissions Students are normally expected to have a grade point average above 3.0 and scores on the two parts of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Aptitude Test which total over 1,100. Decisions on admission are strongly influenced by let\u00ad ters of recommendation and the statement of student inter\u00ad est. International students will be evaluated primarily on the basis of letters of recommendation and completed seminar or research papers, but GRE scores are required in all cases. Requirements The following is in addition to the general School and campus requirements. Each year a core program, focusing upon methodology and substantive problems of current interest, will be outlined for entering graduate students. Those who have not already taken college mathematics are required to take at least three quarters of approved mathematics or sta\u00ad tistics courses. At the completion of the first year, the per\u00ad formance of each student is reviewed and the faculty will indicate whether the student should continue. Attendance in a colloquium series also is required for all graduate students during their first two years in residence. Reviews and Examinations Students ordinarily are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.5 or better. At the completion of the first year a review of performance in the core program will be conducted for each student by the Politics, Society, and Social Issues faculty. At that time, an advising committee of three faculty is identified to supervise the examinations leading to advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. By June 1 of each year, the approval of the advisory committee must be obtained for the student to be eligible for financial support during the subsequent academic year. A set of written examinations, normally taken at the end of the second year of study, tests competency in a set of major domains of intellectual inquiry determined by the student and the advisory committee. Upon successful completion of these comprehensive examinations and demonstration of competence in mathematics and foreign language, a formal candidacy committee \u00b7is appointed to oversee the final qualify\u00ad ing examination and formal advancement to candidacy. Stu\u00ad dents are expected to advance to candidacy by the ninth quarter of graduate study. After the student advances to candidacy, the doctoral com\u00ad mittee, usually composed of three members of the candidacy committee, supervises work toward completion of the dissertation.

Lave: Anthropology, Cross-Cultural Research on Cognition, Comparative Models of Social Organization Karen Leonard: Social History of India, Comparative History of Women and the Family, Asian-American Social History Robert Newcomb: Statistics, Research Methods in the Social Sci- ences and Education, Use of Computers in Education The faculty in Social Relations shares with traditional anthropology an interest in whole systems and a willingness to consider long-as well as short-run sociocultural effects. It has a commitment to include the meaning and content of the actions, events, and phenomena it studies from the micro-to the macro-level. The faculty also is concerned about similari\u00ad ties and differences among people living at different times and in different places. Unlike traditional anthropology, how\u00ad ever, we have not limited our interests to small communities nor to traditional forms of data collection or analysis. In addi\u00ad tion, the program leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science with emphasis in anthropology is distinct from more traditional anthropology programs in that it includes no requirements in archaeology or physical anthropology. Admissions We welcome students from diverse educational and social backgrounds. Students who have research interests corres\u00ad ponding to those of specific faculty members are especially encouraged to apply to this apprenticeship-type program. They should familiarize themselves with the publications of the faculty before applying. Requirements Students are admitted by the entire Social Relations faculty. New students are assigned an advisor who serves until a three-person committee is formed, which occurs by the mid\u00ad dle of the second year of residence. The committee oversees the student's academic work and ordinarily is chaired by the faculty member with whom the student plans to work most closely. A core seminar which meets weekly throughout the year is required of first-year graduate students. Students are expected to attend the Social Relations Colloquium Series throughout their graduate careers. In addition, two quarters of statistics, mathematics, computer science, or other appro\u00ad priate analytical methods are required. Normally these will be completed during the first two years of study. Reviews During the first year each student will prepare an original paper under the committee's direction. The paper will be presented by the student at a meeting of the Colloquium Ser\u00ad ies, normally during the spring quarter of the first year. The student's committee members will provide the student with a detailed written critique of the paper as part of the first-year evaluation of the student's overall progress. The second review takes the form of an advancement-to\u00ad candidacy examination. This ordinarily is conducted by the student's committee and two additional faculty members . from the campus. Students are expected to take this exami\u00ad nation no later than the spring quarter of their third year. Satisfactory completion of the dissertation is the final requirement in completing the Ph.D. Foreign Language A speaking or reading knowledge of one foreign language is required. Culture and Health Practices, Economics and Public Policy, and Networks Faculty with shared interests in (1) the interrelationship of culture and health beliefs and practices in cross-cultural per\u00ad spective, (2) economic theory, public economics, and public UC IRVINE - 1982-1983policy, or (3) relations among social units with an emphasis on mathematical and computer techniques in data analysis and modeling are developing interdisciplinary emphases in these three areas within the School of Social Sciences. At present, there is no formal graduate curriculum leading to a Ph.D. in these areas; however, individual courses of study .under the interdisciplinary committee system may be approved for selected graduate students, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Sciences. Prior to application, prospective students whose interests include culture and health practices, econom\u00ad ics and public policy or networks are advised to consult with a member of the respective faculty group. Culture and Health Practices John Boyd: Mathematical Anthropology Michael Butler: Social Sciences, How People Think and How They Could Think Better Douglas K. Chalmers: Social Psychology Craig MacAndrew: Psychology, Personality Theory Duane Metzger: Cognitive Anthropology, Belief Systems, and Semantic Analysis Louis Narens: Measurement and Logic Robert Newcomb: Statistics, Research Methods in the Social Sci\u00ad ences and Education, Use of Computers in Education A. Kimball Romney: Social Sciences, Social Anthropology, Cognitive Anthropology W.C. Watt: Cognitive Semiotics The faculty developing an area of emphasis in Culture and Health Practices share individual interests in anthropology, psychology, and sociology, with a common interest in the investigation of the interrelationship of culture and health beliefs and practices in cross-cultural perspective. The various disciplinary strengths represented by the faculty afford max\u00ad imum opportunities for graduate students to develop a well\u00ad grounded and flexible research approach. Economics and Public Policy Duran Bell: Formal Models, Labor Economics Gordon J. Fielding: Urban Theory and Transportation Policy Maxwell Fry: Monetary Economics and Financial Institutions Amihai Glazer: Industrial Organization and Policy Analysis Bernard Grofman: Public Choice, Law and Economics, and Models of Collective Decision Making John Johnston: Econometrics Shulamit Kahn: Labor Economics Sheen T.

Lave: Transportation Policy, Economics of Energy, and Social Change Julius Margolis: Economic Analysis of Government Behavior: Posi\u00ad tive and Normative Carole Uhlaner: Comparative Political Participation, Formal Models of Political Behavior Christian Werner: Mathematical Geography and Transportation Networks Economists and faculty from the other social sciences who share interests in public economics, evaluation of public pol\u00ad icy, and economic theory are developing an area of emphasis in Economics and Public Policy. This specialization was chosen for two reasons: first, governments and nonprofit institutions now occupy a primary role in our society so that an understanding of their behavior has become critical to understanding the economy in general; second, public eco\u00ad nomics has become one of the most intellectually exciting frontiers in economic analysis. Special emphasis is on research in the following areas: public choice, political economy, public policy, and organizational behavior. Graduate courses taught by the faculty listed above focus on positive and normative analysis of the behavior of government in formulating and implementing public policy. Social Sciences 173 Theory building is emphasized, as well as empirical studies in governmental behavior and substantive areasof public policy. The School of Social Sciences has strengths in formal social analysis which are valuable adjuncts to economic theorizing about the public sector. Faculty members are affiliated with two major research institutes, the Institute of Transportation Studies and the Public Policy Research Organization. Public policy and economics are central issues of both institutes. These research institutes provide funding for graduate stu\u00ad dents who select public policy or transportation as a special\u00ad ized field. The existing academic programs in medicine and social ecology also provide intellectual support.

Kimball Romney: Social Sciences, Social Anthropology, Cognitive Anthropology Christian Werner: Mathematical Geography and Transportation Networks Douglas R. White: Networks and Social Structure, Cross-Cultural Comparisons, Mathematical Anthropology, Division of Labor The faculty developing an area of emphasis in Networks focuses on relations among social units. These units may be individuals, organizations, or collectivities, but in every case, stress is placed on the patterns of relationships among them. The faculty shares an emphasis in mathematical and com\u00ad puter techniques in data analysis and modeling. Although no single mathematical tool can be said to dominate the field, its practitioners frequently use the theories of graphs, automata, semigroups, and stochastic processes. Computers are used for multidimensional scaling and statistical analysis, as well as for simulations. The School of Social Sciences has always emphasized formal analysis, and it is out of this tradition that the faculty listed above draws strength. In fact, many of the Networks faculty are affiliated with the established groups within the School. COURSES IN SOCIAL SCIENCES Courses in the School do not always resemble conventional university courses either in content or in format. Students at any level are encouraged to suggest areas of individual study and may (with faculty approval) pursue any intellectually challenging area within the social sciences. Such courses may include special seminars, study projects, individual papers, or any other useful educational activity. The faculty encourages students to present evidence that they have done interesting and original work and to receive official credit for that work by enrolling in an individual study course. Such courses are numbered 198 and 199 (undergraduate) and 299 (graduate). Students from other schools are encouraged to take courses and talk with faculty within the School. In addition to the introductory courses, many of the upper-division courses are open to students without previous work in social science. Since many of the courses touch on several areas of social science, a list of major areas of concentration is normally included in the description of a course. The classification terms used for this purpose are anthropology, comparative UC IRVINE - 1982-1983174 Social Sciences culture, economics, geography, political science, psychology, and sociology. Most upper-division courses are arranged in modules in order to provide continuity over individual courses, to facilitate long-range planning by students, and to encourage the pursuit of interdisciplinary programs of study. Students are encouraged to take advantage of the module concept to acquire experience in several integrated sets of courses. It is not necessary, however, for students to take all courses listed in a module; module courses may be taken individually, as long as course prerequisites have been met. The specific courses offered in module form may vary from year to year, but the structure of the curriculum will remain stable. Ordinarily, a student can expect to find at least one module offered in each broad area each year. By observing the content area of courses and by making effective use of module sequences, a student can assemble an individual pro\u00ad gram of study in a particular discipline or in an interdiscipli\u00ad nary area. Listed below are course descriptions of some of the proposed courses to be offered during 1982-83. A final, complete listing of the courses offered will be available prior to the beginning of each quarter in 122 Social Science Tower. Students who are interested in obtaining this material may receive copies by visiting or writing to the School of Social Sciences. NOTE: Students who entered UCI before fall quarter, 1980 should refer to the 1979-80 UCI General Catalogue and previous editions for information on the course numbering and lettering sys\u00ad tem prior to fall 1980.

These prob\u00ad lems include predicting the orbit of a satellite, simulating the economy, keeping track of inventories, and sending mail elec\u00ad tronically. Such problems are solved by having the computer execute a procedure-a sequence of information processing operations including, but not limited to, arithmetic opera\u00ad tions, testing and comparing numbers and representations of alphabetic information, and changing the sequence of opera\u00ad tions within the computer. Information and computer science is concerned with the development of procedures which are effective and efficient, languages suitable for stating these procedures, systems for executing procedures, and the social setting in which they are used. The implications of research in the development of informa\u00ad tion processing procedures and of systems for preparing and executing these procedures extend beyond the direct applica\u00ad tions in using the modern digital computer to solve problems ranging from bookkeeping to the control of orbiting satel\u00ad lites. Many animate and inanimate systems can be usefully viewed as information processing systems and analyzed in terms of the way they represent, store, and process informa\u00ad tion. Thus information and computer science provides a point of view, an approach, for studying phenomena in many sciences. Computing resources available to students include interactive access to the systems in the campus Computing Facility: a DECsystem-10, a Xerox Sigma-7, a DEC PDP-11/45, 12 Ter\u00ad aks, and 12 ACI Micro-engines. The departmental computing laboratory equipment includes two DECsystem-2020s, a VAX-11/750, and a complement of peripheral devices. On the basis our our experience over the past several years, we anticipate that the number of incoming freshmen and UC IRVINE - 1982-1983190 Information and Computer Science advanced-standing students who elect ICS as a major in the fall of 1983 will exceed the number of positions available. In the fall of 1982less than half of the incoming applicants who elected ICS were admitted to the major. Fall 1982 transfer students are required to have the follow\u00ad ing: a minimum of 56 semester units/84 quarter units with a grade point average of 3.0 in courses accepted for transfer; two years of transferable college mathematics, including one year of calculus, with a grade point average of 3.0; comple\u00ad tion of one year of computer science courses, including the equivalent of ICS 1, with a grade point average of 3.0; suffi\u00ad cient transferable credits to satisfy the majority of breadth requirements, and satisfaction of the lower-division writing requirement (one year of college English composition). Fall 1982 transfer students who, on the basis of their high school records and SAT scores, would be eligible for admis\u00ad sion as freshman to the ICS major, need only be eligible for transfer under University standards. To ensure that their application is considered for the fall of 1983, students should be sure to file their application so it arrives on campus before November 30, 1982. The selection criteria will include grades, test scores, and affirmative action considerations. Students interested in using computers as an adjunct to their major field of study will be able to enroll in the introductory programming sequence (ICS lB, 2L, and 3). Degrees Information and Computer Science ....... B.S., M.S., Ph.D. Honors Honors at magna cum laude, summa cum laude, are awarded on the basis of grade point average and the student's performance on research. Approx\u00ad imately 12 percent of the graduating seniors are selected for honors. A general criterion is that students must have com\u00ad pleted at least 72 units in residence at a University of Cali\u00ad fornia campus. Careers for the ICS Major Students with undergraduate degrees in Information and Computer Science have been successful in finding career opportunities in recent years. Employment is available in computer programming, systems analysis, project control administration, and marketing. A Bachelor's degree in Infor\u00ad mation and Computer Science can be part of a preparatory program for graduate work in computer science, business administration, or social science. UNDERGRADUATEPROG~ The undergraduate program in Information and Computer Science (ICS) is designed for students preparing for profes\u00ad sional careers and for students preparing for graduate study in information and computer science. It is designed to acquaint the student with the currently available methods of information and computer science which are useful in solving problems of science, industry, and government; to prepare the student for the additional formal and self-education required in this rapidly developing field; and to foster and extend the student's abilities to solve the kinds of problems encountered in information and computer science. T_he use of the computer as a problem-solving tool and the effects of its adoption on procedure and data representation are the under\u00ad lying themes of the program. Students enrolled in other degree programs who are inter\u00ad ested in digital computer programming will normally begin their studies with Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving I (ICS lB) and continue in the programming se\u00ad quence with Programming and Problem Solving II (ICS 2, 2L) and Programming and Problem Solving III (ICS 3) as far as their interests require and their programs permit. Students who are doing, or planning to do, extensive work with numerical problems are advised to consider courses in numer\u00ad ical analysis. Students interested in courses in computer engineering and digital systems should consult the list of Engineering courses. Students can declare a double major in Engineering and ICS; early consultation on such a double major is advisable. Students are advised on academic matters by faculty and staff. Advising of undergraduate students is coordinated by the departmental counselors who also provide information on vocational and counseling services available on the campus. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 12. Departmental Requirements Information and Computer Science lB, 2, 2L, 3. Any six of the following nine Information and Computer Science courses, provided at least one course and not more than two courses are chosen from each group: 141, 142; ISlA, 151B, 152; 161, 162; 171, 172.

Students may inquire at the Information and Com\u00ad puter Science Counseling Office for a copy. The 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Information and Computer Science majors may enter a coop\u00ad erative 3-2 program offered by the Graduate School of Man\u00ad agement. The special five-year program for selected students leads to both a Bachelor of Science degree in Information and Computer Science and a degree in Administration. Inquiries should be directed to the Graduate School of Management. GRADUATE PROGRAM M.S. Degree The course of study leading to the Master's degree in ICS provides advanced education in information and computer science for computer professionals with a B.S. in computer science or a related area. The program combines advanced study in basic areas of computer science with opportunities for specialization in software design and analysis, information systems, or computer systems organization. The program can be completed in two years or less of full-time study, or can be taken on a part-time basis. Software Design and Analysis-emphasis on the analysis, design, implementation, and management of software sys\u00ad tems, such as operating systems, translators, and information retrieval systems. Information Systems-emphasis on the analysis of informa\u00ad tion requirements in organizations and the design of systems to meet those requirements. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Computer System Organization-emphasis on the specifica\u00ad tion and synthesis of computer systems, particularly their organizational and hardware aspects. Admission to the program requires a baccalaureate degree, including two years of course work beyond the introductory level in computer science and at least two years of college\u00ad level mathematics or equivalent work experience. The Grad\u00ad uate Record Examination (GRE) Aptitude Test is required, and the GRE Advanced Test in Computu Science is strongly recommended. The departmental Graduate Advisor for the M.S. program should be consulted upon entrance, and periodically there\u00ad after, for guidance in the selection of appropriate courses. The Graduate Advisor also is an important source of infor\u00ad mation about other academic matters. When the student is \u00b7 prepared to begin work on the thesis and is advanced to can\u00ad didacy for the M.S. degree, a formal thesis committee will be appointed to supervise the thesis and to accept it on behalf of the Graduate Council. The program consists of 12 courses (48 units). Three may be upper-division undergraduate courses. If appropriate to the program, up to three graduate courses (12 units) may be accepted as transfer credit from other institutions. Three courses (12 units) are required of all students in the M.S. program: ICS 221 (Analysis of Computer Systems) ICS 231 (Formal Analytic Techniques) ICS 245 (introduction to Software Engineering) A thesis reporting on a major piece of technical work also is required. The program is available to students who are unable to study full time because of personal or professional commitments. Ph.D. Program The program leading to the Ph.D. in Information and Com\u00ad puter Science is research-oriented and encourages students to work together with faculty to solve advanced problems in computer science. Currently, active research groups are working in analysis of algorithms, artificial intelligence, machine architecture, programming environments, software engineering, and social impacts of computing. All of these studies have extramural funding. Students as well as faculty are active professionally; a number of student papers have recently been accepted for publication in the r.roceedings of national conferences. The Ph.D. program is designed for full\u00ad time study, and can be completed in four to five years, depending upon the focus of research. Admission Approximately 15 students are admitted each year. Applica\u00ad tions are evaluated on the basis of the student's prior aca\u00ad demic record and potential for creative professional contribu\u00ad tions. Applicants are expected to have good skills in computer programming and skills in mathematics equivalent to those obtained by students who complete college-level courses in logic and set theory, analysis, linear algebra, and modern algebra or probability and statistics. Computer science undergraduate training is not required, but some familiarity with machine organization, data structures, software sys\u00ad tems, and formal models is helpful. Applicants should take both the GRE Aptitude Test and the GRE Advanced Test in Computer Science. Where feasible, personal interviews are desired, but inability to have one does not prejudice an application. Additional information on appli-Information and Computer Science 191 \u00b7-l cation procedures can be obtained from the Division of Graduate Studies and Research. Further information on the Department and the graduate program can be obtained by writing to the Department. Financial Assistance Financial assistance is available to students in the form of teaching and research assistantships. Stipends vary, depend\u00ad ing on the duties involved, and range up to $7,299 for the academic year. Students who also teach or assist with faculty research during the summer may earn an additional $2,000 to $4,000 per year. More than half of the doctoral students in residence receive financial assistance. General Requirements fo~ the Ph.D. The Ph.D. degree is attained in three phases. Phase I. Breadth: The purpose of the breadth phase is to develop the student's understanding of broad areas in computer science. Understanding is certified by satisfactory performance in courses or on a written examination in five areas: 1. Architecture and Operating Systems 2. Programming Languages and Data Structures 3. Formal Methods 4. Artificial Intelligence 5. Design, Analysis, and Impact of Systems The examination is designed to test both basic knowledge and problem-solving ability. It is given once a year. Students are required to pass Phase I by the end of their second year. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983192 Information and Computer Science Phase II. Directed Research: Research under faculty direction in this phase is intended to develop research skills such as use of the literature; problem identification, definition, and analy\u00ad sis in depth; and creative problem solving. This research may be conducted individually or with other students. Phase II concludes with an oral qualifying examination conducted by a formal candidacy committee, appointed by the Dean of Grad\u00ad uate Studies and Research. In this examination the student must demonstrate the essential research skills. Phase III. Dissertation: This phase is devoted almost ex\u00ad clusively to the dissertation. When the student has passed the formal qualifying examination and advanced to candidacy, a doctoral committee is appointed to supervise the dissertation and approve it on behalf of the Graduate Council. The timing and methods chosen by students and their faculty advisors to develop competence in different areas are ex\u00ad pected to vary. Typically the student and the advisors will outline a program for each area that makes use of a combina\u00ad tion of the following resources: courses, individual study, project work, directed research. Colloquium: Each student shall present a colloquium to the Department in the area of interest prior to entering the dis\u00ad sertation phase. Teaching Requirement: All ICS doctoral students are re\u00ad quired to participate in teaching activities before being advanced to candidacy. Teaching activities in summer or night school, service at other universities, etc., may be accepted as fulfillment of the requirement. Programming Competence Requirement: A computer scien\u00ad tist must be able to read and write programs in assembly, algebraic, and nonnumerical languages. Faculty Research Interests Research areas of the faculty include multimachine and dis\u00ad tributed machine architecture, data flow and reduction lan\u00ad guage machines, data flow representations of data base, pro\u00ad gramming languages, program development and maintenance environments, data structures, analysis of algorithms and concrete complexity, natural language processing, knowledge representation, computer models of music theory, software engineering tools and methods especially for analysis and design, social impacts of computing, and management of computing resources.

Whiteley, Ed.D. Harvard University, Professor of Social Ecol\u00ad ogy and Vice Chancellor Student Affairs (moral development, educational environments, late adolescent to early adult development) The Program in Social Ecology applies interdisciplinary scien\u00ad tific methods to the study of a wide range of recurring social and environmental problems. Among the issues of longstand\u00ad ing interest to the Program are violence in society, social influences on normal and atypical human development over the life span, and aspects of the physical environment which have an impact on human health and behavior. The curriculum is organized around three major problem areas (Environmental Analysis, Criminal Justice, Social Behavior) rather than by traditional academic disciplines (e.g., regional planning, criminology, psychology). The Program in Social Ecology maintains a central interest in human adapta\u00ad tion and a special but not exclusive interest in the study of events in the natural settings in which they occur. Social ecologists also use laboratory, questionnaire, and interview methods to study human social and environmental problems. The faculty of Social Ecology is multidisciplinary. It includes psychologists who have specialized in developmental, envir\u00ad onmental, community, and social environmental health scien\u00ad tists; and lawyers. While faculty members are firmly grounded in their parent disciplines and teach basic courses in them, they concentrate their efforts on teaching and research with a problem orientation. In these problem-oriented courses, they integrate concepts and perspectives of several disciplines. This focus arises from commitment to the view that the analysis of complex societal problems requires inter\u00ad disciplinary efforts (i.e., the joining of talents by people with different intellectual backgrounds). Another feature of instruction in Social Ecology is the use of lecturers from the community, individuals whose academic qualifications are complemented by their experiences with practical applica\u00ad tions. For example, a judge, an architect, and a former police officer are among those who teach courses in the Program. A number of social ecologists are involved in interventions . directed toward improving the way groups of individuals, institutions, and communities function; a number of others are involved in interventions aimed at improving the quality and control of the environment. Degrees Social Ecology .......................... B.A., M.A., Ph.D. Applied Ecology (offered jointly with the School of Biological Sciences) .............. B.A. Honors Honors at graduation will be awarded to about 12 percent of the graduating seniors. Initial eligibility for such honors will be on the basis of grade point average. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in resi\u00ad dence at a University of California campus. Final decisions concerning the awards of summa cum laude, magna cum laude, and cum laude will reflect a number of other factors, including quarters of work completed at UCI, number of graded units of course. work in Social Ecology, and the quality of papers written for field study and independent study. Decisions about the award of honors are the responsibility of a commit\u00ad tee chaired by the Associate Director for Undergraduate Studies. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983196 Social Ecology UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY The undergraduate program in Social Ecology is organized around four curricular components: a Principles and Methods cluster and three subareas each concerned broadly with prob\u00ad lems of Environmental Analysis, Criminal Justice, and Social Behavior, respectively. Students do not major in a particular subarea; rather, they are expected to develop a degree of competence in each. Field Study. An important characteristic of the undergradu\u00ad ate program is its field study requirement for majors. Field study is open only to Social Ecology majors. In faculty\u00ad supervised field study situations, students relate theories learned in the classroom to actual social-environmental prob\u00ad lems, use acquired skills to collect meaningful data, and test findings from controlled laboratory studies in the more com\u00ad plex settings in which significant behaviors and events actu\u00ad ally occur. The settings provided for field study include a wide range of problem-oriented institutions and agencies, e.g., Orange County Planning Department, Orange County Department of Mental Health, Orange County District Attorney's Office, California Youth Authority, Envi\u00ad ronmental Education Council. Other field study placements may be generated by faculty and students to fit their particu\u00ad lar interests. All field studies are taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis. Further information on field study, including informa\u00ad tion about sign-up procedures, may be obtained from the Social Ecology Counseling Office. Career Opportunities. Graduates of the Program in Social Ecology bring a distinctive cross-disciplinary perspective to the job market. The Program provides a solid foundation for those students who seek jobs in planning departments, men\u00ad tal health settin~s, educational institutions, and a variety of community and governmental agencies. Many Social Ecology students find that their interdisciplinary training is also use\u00ad ful for careers in management and personnel. The Program also provides sound preparation for students who wish to apply to graduate and professional schools of law, administration, public health, social welfare, psychology, sociology, criminology, and urban planning. Further informa\u00ad tion on career and graduate school preparation can be found in the Sample Programs section on page 198. Major Subareas Environmental Analysis The Environmental Analysis subarea is concerned with the impact of the physical environment on human health and behavior. Students begin with basic courses in human ecol\u00ad ogy, environmental quality, environmental psychology, urban sociology, and planning and public policy. Subsequent course work moves toward problem-oriented courses in these areas, enriched by ongoing faculty and student research on such topics as the effects of environmental stressors (e.g., crowd\u00ad ing, smog, noise); the biology and politics of water pollution; compliance with environmental regulations; the way in which economic changes in a community affect the health and well\u00ad being of its residents; the psychological determinants of the decision to have children; the effects of stress on health; and the social effects of urbanization. In addition to providing basic knowledge for students in other areas, courses are relevant to professional careers in the areas of administration, environmental quality and health, environmental impact assessment, and community environmental education. Graduate and professional oppor\u00ad tunities related to environmental analysis include urban and regional planning, architecture, environmental psychology, ecology, public health, and urban sociology. Special emphasis is placed upon the roles of individual citizens and community organizations, both governmental and private, in maintaining and enhancing the quality of the human environment. Field study is done at the Orange County Planning Department, the offices of private architectural firms, environmental information centers, pollution control agencies, and health agencies. Criminal Justice The Criminal Justice subarea is concerned with the social control of criminality and violence and with the relationship between society and its legal institutions, including prisons and the courts. Basic courses cover forms of criminal behav\u00ad ior and introduce the student to the criminal justice system. Subsequent course work is complemented by ongoing faculty and student research on such topics as the determinants of police decisions to shoot; characteristics of persons and of situations which promote intervention by \"good Samaritans\" at the scene of crimes; violence against women; the control of delinquency through family counseling and crisis interven\u00ad tion; the analysis of court decisions; and the deterrence of criminal behavior, including white collar and corporate crime. The Criminal Justice subarea provides Social Ecology stu\u00ad dents with opportunities to examine critical issues in regard to criminal and delinquent behavior and society's reaction to crime. The course of study prepares students for careers in law enforcement and corrections, as well as for law school and other graduate programs, including criminology and sociology. Offerings examine social problems that involve crime and society's reactions to these problems, and assess the organization and operation of the criminal justice system as it now functions. Field study placements are available in police departments, prosecutors' and public defenders' offices, probation and parole agencies, consumer affairs agencies, the state juvenile detention system, the UCI College Legal Clinic, and in private legal firms. Social Behavior The Social Behavior subarea is concerned with the relation\u00ad ship between the social environment and human behavior. The central objective is to study variations in social settings (e.g., the family, school, work place) that have implications for healthy and unhealthy development over the course of the life cycle. Students begin with basic course work in human development, social psychology, community psychol\u00ad ogy, and abnormal psychology. Subsequent course work, enriched by research, examines such topics as the treatment of childhood hyperactivity; social and economic factors asso\u00ad ciated with child abuse; influences on adolescents' psychologi\u00ad cal and social development; the role of social support (family and friendship networks) in moderating stressful life events; the social ties of the elderly; the evaluation of social pro\u00ad grams; and effects of stress on mental health. Students are given a foundation which will enable them to work after graduation from UCI in the private or public sec\u00ad tors or to do graduate work in psychology, human develop\u00ad ment, social work, counseling, or education. Approximately SO agencies are available for field study in this subarea, including schools, child care facilities, community clinics, hos\u00ad pital settings, and social service agencies.

Social Ecology Requirements Social Ecology 1 (Principles of Social Ecology) and 10 (Re\u00ad search Design); J4 (introduction to Criminal Justice), E8 (Introduction to Environmental Analysis), and 59 (Introduc\u00ad tion to Human Behavior); required prerequisite courses for field study in a given subarea; Social Ecology 197 A (Applied Learning in Field Settings) followed by two quarters of field study (E197, 5197, or J197), to be elected during the junior and senior years; and five upper-division courses (those numbered 100-196) from Program offerings. Planning a Program of Study As noted earlier, students who major in Social Ecology do not limit themselves to a single subarea of interest. Rather, they are encouraged to develop an appreciation of a wide array of person-environment problems. The strongest program of study also will include basic course work in at least one of the social, biological, or physical sciences. Students who enter the major as freshmen should plan to complete the required lower-division courses by the end of the junior year. Transfer students and students who declare a major in Social Ecology after entering UCI should work with the Social Ecology Counseling Office to develop a plan for meeting the requirements of the major in an orderly fashion. The Social Ecology Counseling Office is prepared to help all students in planning a program of study. Contact with this Office is important so that students will develop a broad, yet coherent, series of courses. Students who expect to pursue graduate study should consult also with appropriate faculty members to ensure proper preparation.

Students who plan to obtain a teaching credential or a higher degree in the field of education should consult with counselors in the Office of Teacher Education early in their college careers. Students completing a B.A. in Social Ecology may qualify for a waiver of the Single Subject Cre\u00ad dential Examination. Social Ecology courses that are relevant to a career in education include: credentials, see page 233. The 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Students who are interested in a career in administration and who have completed all of the course requirements for the B.A. in Social Ecology and the UCI breadth requirement may apply to the Graduate School of Management for their 3-2 Program. Application should be made early in the junior year. During their senior year, Program participants will take courses in management which will count toward the 180 total units needed to receive a bachelor's degree. Upon suc\u00ad cessful completion of the required courses and units, usually at the conclusion of four years of undergraduate study, a B.A. degree will be awarded by the Program in Social Ecol\u00ad ogy. A Master's degree in Business Administration, Public Administration, or Business and Public Administration wHI be awarded after successful completion of all requirements for the advanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. Concentration in Women's Studies The Women's Studies concentration is not a major but is intended to allow a student to complement any major in the School of Humanities, the School of Social Sciences, or the Program in Social Ecology by the systematic study of women Social Ecology 199 in culture and society. For further information on the con- centration, see page 129. \u00b7 UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR IN APPLIED ECOLOGY The Program in Social Ecology and the School of Biological Sciences offer a program of undergraduate instruction lead\u00ad ing to a B.A. degree in Applied Ecology. The interdisciplinary curriculum furnishes a strong undergraduate foundation for students interested in advanced study in environmental plan\u00ad ning and resource management. An Applied Ecology major receives the basic science training of a Biological Sciences major and utilizes these skills in a core of environmentally based courses taught in Social Ecol\u00ad ogy. Social Ecology brings to this major a unique combination of courses in Environmental Quality and Health, Planning and Public Policy, and Law and Society. This combination, together with a strong biology background contributed by the School of Biological Sciences and a general science back\u00ad ground contributed by the School.of Physical Sciences, enables students selecting this major to pursue interdiscipli\u00ad nary learning experiences which are difficult to achieve within traditional disciplines. The first three years of the major are very structured, leaving the last year open for stu\u00ad dents to specialize in an area of their choice. Careers in Applied Ecology Careers in the fields of environmental and resource man\u00ad agement and planning are particularly suited to an Applied Ecology background. Many graduates hold technical or admin\u00ad istrative positions in, for example, the United States Envi\u00ad ronmental Protection Agency; or in California's Regional Water Quality Control Board, Air Resources Board, Depart\u00ad ment of Fish and Game, and Department of Health and Human Services; or in various county and city agencies. A variety of firms in the private sector employ Applied Ecology graduates to prepare environmental impact reports, labora\u00ad tory analyses, and planning studies. Industrial health profes\u00ad sionals are in demand to help determine the safety or work\u00ad place environments for the labor force. The Applied Ecology major also provides a strong academic foundation for gradu\u00ad ate or professional study in areas such as conservation and natural resources, environmental health science, microbiol\u00ad ogy, public health, law, planning, and administration. The Applied Ecology major provides students with a compre\u00ad hensive treatment of basic ecological principles and their relevance to human needs. As an alternate pathway, students with an engineering perspective are encouraged to explore the program options in Environmental Engineering offered by the School of Engineering. Also, students are encouraged to explore the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology, leading to a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences, offered by the School of Biological Sciences. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree in Applied Ecol~gy University Requirements: See page 12. Applied Ecology Requirements Each student must fulfill the following general, field study, and elective requirements: UC IRVINE - 1982-1983200 Social Ecology General: Mathematics 2A, 2B, and 7; or Mathematics 2A, 28, and Social Ecology 10; or Mathematics 14A, 148, and 7; or Mathematics 14A, 148, and Social Ecology 10; or Mathemat\u00ad ics 14A-B-C.

Field Study: Social Ecology 197 A and one quarter of 197; or two quarters of Independent Study (199) under a faculty member in one of the focused areas below. Elective: No fewer than three, and preferably, six courses in one of the following focused areas: Resource Management-Aquatic Environments Biological Sciences 120, 169, 175, 176, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182; Social Ecology E125, E140, E167A, El67B. Resource Management- Terrestrial Environments Biological Sciences 120, 167, 171, 172, 173, 174, 177, 184, 185, 186, 187, 189. Water Pollution Biological Sciences 122, 127, 175, 178, 180; Social Sciences 173, 206; Engineering CE166, E167B, Engineering CE166; Social Ecology El10, E121, E156A, E156B, Program of Study It is important that students take the required science courses early, in order that the science background may be utilized in the Social Ecology courses. There are many required courses, and the student must plan carefully. For initial academic advising, students should consult the Social Ecology Counseling Office (544 Engineering Building) or the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Faculty academic advisors may be either Social Ecology or Biological Sciences faculty members. GRADUATE PROGRAM IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY The Program in Social Ecology offers graduate education leading to the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. Students desiring a Ph.D. should apply directly for the Ph.D. program. Only individuals interested in the M.A. as their final degree in Social Ecology should apply for admis\u00ad sion at the Master's level. The emphasis in Social Ecology graduate study is primarily upon theory and research which have implications for policy and social action. Clinical training is not offered. All applicants for either the M.A. or Ph.D. should submit undergraduate transcripts, three letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination Aptitude Test scores, and a formal application to the Division of Grad\u00ad uate Studies and Research before February 1. Interested per\u00ad sons may call the Social Ecology Graduate Counselor, Jan Martin (714) 833-5917, for further information. The Program in Social Ecology is organized around the study of contemporary problems in the social and physical envi\u00ad ronment. Problems are researched from the diversified view\u00ad points of a multidisciplinary faculty, including specialists in community, environmental, social, developmental, and health psychology; planning; urban sociology; law; criminology; and environmental health. Graduate education emphasizes this multidisciplinary orientation rather than the focused perspec\u00ad tive of a single discipline. Social Ecology is committed to an empirical approach. Pro\u00ad gram evaluation, legal research, questionnaire and survey methods, field research, naturalistic observation, and quasi\u00ad experimental techniques are emphasized as much as labora\u00ad tory experimentation. A sampling of faculty research and teaching interests includes, but is not limited to, human stress, psychosocial aspects of physical and emotional health, program evaluation, economic change and behavioral disorders, atypical child development, effects of employment on adolescent social and cognitive development and adult well-being, police use of deadly force, legal sanctions and deterrence, white collar crime, effects of the physical environment upon social behav\u00ad ior and health, childbearing decisions, urban decentralization, social support systems among the elderly, water quality, air quality, the use of scientific information in public policy for\u00ad mation, and environmental regulatory processes. A predoc\u00ad toral and postdoctoral training program, sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health, emphasizing the rela\u00ad tions among environmental demands, human development, and health, commenced in fall 1981. Collaborative research with faculty members is an important component of graduate education in Social Ecology. Prospec\u00ad tive graduate students should contact the Social Ecology Graduate Counselor for more detailed information concern\u00ad ing the current research interests of Social Ecology faculty members. M.A. Program Each incoming Master's student is assigned a faculty advisor with whom the student discusses an individual program of graduate education. The program leading to the M.A. degree requires a thesis and satisfactory completion of seven approved courses (28 units), including the Seminar in Social Ecology (200), Research Methods (201), and at least one addi\u00ad tional approved course in statistics or methodology. Other courses should be selected with regard to the student's aca\u00ad demic and career objectives, and must be approved by the faculty advisor. The seven required courses must include at least five graduate courses and must be exclusive of any directed study, independent study, or thesis courses (298, 299, or 295). One four-unit field study (297) course may be counted as one of the seven required courses. A grade of B or better must be achieved in all courses. Students are advanced to candidacy for the M.A. degree, and a thesis committee appointed, after a review of their graduate work and thesis plans by a faculty committee. All M.A. students who have not advanced to candidacy will be formally evaluated by the Social Ecology faculty at the end of each academic year. At that time the faculty may recommend that the student con\u00ad tinue toward the M.A. or cease study in the Program. Eval\u00ad uation of M.A. students who have advanced to candidacy is the responsibility of the student's Master's thesis committee. One year of academic residence is required, but completion of UC IRVINE - 1982-1983all M.A. requirements, including a thesis approved by the student's committee, ordinarily takes about two years. The M.A. degree in Social Ecology may be useful in obtaining a variety of positions. Many recent M.A. graduates are now employed in federal, state, county, city, and private agencies in such areas as planning, mental health and welfare, and probation and parole. A number of students with the Mas\u00ad ter's degree in Social Ecology have entered Ph.D. programs at other universities. Ph.D. Program The doctoral program offers advanced training that prepares students for research and teaching positions. Graduates may be particularly qualified for positions with private or governmental agencies where they can bring advanced aca\u00ad demic training, insight, and expertise to bear in such areas as environmental quality, urban planning, criminal justice, and functional and dysfunctional social development. Students who enter with the normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree in four to five years. Each incoming Ph.D. student will be assigned a faculty advi\u00ad sor with whom the student should meet at least once every quarter to discuss an individualized program of graduate edu\u00ad cation. Required for all Ph.D. students are: Seminar in Social Ecology (200), Research Methods (201), two approved quar\u00ad ters of graduate-level statistics, Program Evaluation (291), and Issues in Social Interventions (213). In addition to these six required core courses, doctoral stu\u00ad dents must also complete a minimum of six other approved graduate level courses before advancement to candidacy. These six additional required courses are exclusive of any field study, directed study, independent study, or dissertation research courses (297, 298, 299, or 296). Students may take each of their electives within a different substantive area or may take clusters of courses within fewer subareas. Among the substantive areas in which multiple electives are offered are: Environmental Sociology (SE202, Law and Society (SE245, SE254). Several specialized courses on survey research, theory development, statistics, and teach\u00ad ing are offered (SE214, SE260, SE261, SE264A,B, SE290A\u00ad B). In addition, courses which may be applicable to a student's subarea are offered by other academic units on the campus (e.g., Graduate School of Management, School of Social Sciences, School of Biological Sciences). All Ph.D. students who have not been advanced to candidacy will be formally evaluated by the Social Ecology faculty at the end of each year. At that time, the faculty may recommend that the student continue toward the Ph.D., complete the M.A. degree only, or cease graduate studies in the Program. Evaluation of Ph.D. students advanced to candidacy is the responsibility of the student's doctoral dissertation commit\u00ad tee. Prior to the award of the Ph.D., each doctoral student must serve as a Teaching Assistant under faculty supervision for at least two quarters. Social Ecology 201 All Ph.D. students are required to complete a research project before advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. The method of research may include experiments, questionnaire and sur\u00ad vey studies, systematic field observation, computer simula\u00ad tion, etc. It is expected that students will begin this project during their first year in residence and that it will be com\u00ad pleted during the second year. The written report of the proj\u00ad ect may be equivalent to a Master's thesis and may be sub\u00ad mitted as such if the student has been advanced to candidacy for the M.A. degree. Also, before being officially advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D., doctoral students must demonstrate mastery of one or more research areas within Social Ecology. Accordingly, stu\u00ad dents are required to submit a written analysis of a social/en\u00ad vironmental problem relevant to one or more disciplines within Social Ecology. The prequalifying requirement can be completed through alternative written formats including a comprehensive examination or the submission of a manu\u00ad script (or series of papers) which intensively examines specific research issues. Preferably, the perspective taken should be interdisciplinary, but a unidisciplinary approach is acceptable if it is more congruent with the student's educational goals and is acceptable to the student's committee. Each student's plans for completing the breadth requirement are developed in collaboration with a committee of three Social Ecology faculty members. Students are encouraged to assemble and meet with this committee as early as possible during their graduate career and are required to do so by no later than the third quarter of their second year. Once the student's plans have been approved and implemented, the examining com\u00ad mittee will meet with the individual to determine his or her success in meeting the breadth requirement, and to recom\u00ad mend additional academic work if it is deemed necessary. A student may be formally advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. when the student's dissertation plan has been approved by the candidacy committee appointed by the Graduate Dean on behalf of the Graduate Council. The student will appear before this committee for an oral examination. The.disserta\u00ad tion plan will include a thorough examination of the history of the problem being proposed for investigation; its current status; the way in which the proposed research will further knowledge; a detailed specification of the proposed method of approach to the problem; and a description of the planned methods for analyzing research findings. Formal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. will be made by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research upon recom\u00ad mendation by a unanimous vote of the student's candidacy committee. Alternatively, the committee may recommend a course of action to strengthen the student for advancement to candidacy at a future date. When the student is advanced to candidacy, a doctoral committee will be appointed on behalf of the Graduate Council. The doctoral committee, ordinarily consisting of three members of the faculty, will supervise the preparation and completion of the doctoral dis\u00ad sertation. The dissertation should be completed and accepted within one to two years, and no later than three calendar years after the student's advancement to candidacy.

Wuerer, PhD. University of California, Irvine, Visiting uclurer in Mechanical Engineering (energy, air resources), Regis\u00ad tered Professional Engineer The School of Engineering offers undergraduate and gradu\u00ad ate programs of study for men and women who will engage in the professional practice of engineering as it relates to design, development, research, other engineering functions, and teaching in industry, government, or a university. Pro\u00ad grams at all levels emphasize the fundamentals underlying engineering, thus enabling the grad\"uates to continue profes\u00ad sional development through formal or informal study. Thus, programs of study in the School of Engineering endeavor to provide UCI graduates with adequate intellectual tools for entrance into the profession and for continued renewal of their technical knowledge. At the undergraduate level a single program in Engineering is offered with options in Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engi\u00ad neering, all of which are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (formerly the Engi\u00ad neers' Council for Professional Development). In addition, an undergraduate double option of Environmental Engineering in conjunction with either the Civil Engineering or the Mechanical Engineering option is available. Courses in computer engineering and digital systems are offered in the Electrical Engineering option. Courses in com\u00ad puter science are offered by the Department of Information and Computer Science (ICS). Students can declare a double major in Engineering and ICS. Early consultation with the School on this and other double-major programs, such as the one with Biological Sciences or the 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management, is advisable. The Engineering program provides a firm background in the basic sciences through courses in physics, mathematics, and chemistry; a fundamental understanding of the engineering sciences through required basic engineering courses; and spe\u00ad cialization via technical electives. The breadth requirement must be taken in the areas of Humanistic Inquiry, Social and Behavioral Sciences, and Writing. At the graduate level, programs of study become less struc\u00ad tured and specialization becomes more intense. The M.S. program requires 36 units to be completed, but the exact choice of the courses will be formulated through consultation between the student and the faculty advisor. Thesis and non\u00ad thesis programs are available. At the Ph.D. level the program is still less structured but more specialized than at the M.S. level. There is no set course requirement; rather, students must demonstrate various competencies as they progress toward the completion of their doctoral programs. Engineering students may join any of a number of student organizations. Most of these organizations are professionally oriented and have relationships to national engineering socie\u00ad ties. A primary function of these groups is to provide regular technical and social meetings for students with common interests. Most of them also participate in the annual Engi\u00ad neering Week activities, held each February, and in other School functions. There are student chapters of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the American Society of Mechani\u00ad cal Engineers (ASME), the Institute of Electrical and Elec-tronic Engineers (IEEE), the Mexican-American Engineering Society (MAES), the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), and the honorary engineering societies Tau Beta Pi and Eta Kappa Nu. Faculty and committee meetings (except those involving per\u00ad sonnel considerations) are open meetings; in addition to designated student representatives, all students are encour\u00ad aged and expected to participate in the development of School policy. Student evaluation of the quality of instruction is made each quarter. Degrees Engineering ............................ B.S., M.S., Ph.D. Honors Undergraduate honors at graduation in the School of Engi\u00ad neering are awarded on the basis of grade point average, and service to the School, service to the University, service to the community, or achievement in research projects. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Approximately 1 percent of the graduating class shall be awarded summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude, with no more than 12 percent being awarded honors. Additional awards in other categories are made throughout the academic year. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The undergraduate program leads to a B.S. degree in Engi\u00ad neering, with accredited options in Civil Engineering, Electri\u00ad cal Engineering, or Mechanical Engineering. A double option of Environmental Engineering in conjunction with either the Civil Engineering or Mechanical Engineering option may be obtained by satisfying the appropriate double option requirements. Admissions Students should plan to enter the Engineering program at UCI as freshmen or as juniors. The sequential nature of the Engineering program and the fact that many courses are offered only once a year also make it imperative that students begin their studies in a fall quarter. High school students wishing to enter the UCI Engineering program are advised to have completed four years of mathe\u00ad matics and one year each of physics and chemistry. That preparation is fundamental to success in the Engineering program and is vital to receiving first consideration for admittance to the Engineering major during periods of re\u00ad stricted enrollments, as are honors courses and advanced placement courses. Applicants should designate Engineering (and possibly an option such as Civil, Electrical, or Mechani\u00ad cal) as their intended major. If enrollment limitations make it necessary, some freshman applications may be redirected to another UC campus which can still accommodate freshman Engineering applicants. As an option, freshman applicants subject to redirection can ask for admission to a special two-year program offered by the Physics Department at UC Riverside. Completing this pro\u00ad gram with at least a 2.40 grade point average guarantees transfer to the UCI School of Engineering as a junior. Transfer students can be admitted to the School of Engineer\u00ad ing upon completion of a lower-division program elsewhere at UCI or at another college, including community colleges. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Students seeking admission to the School of Engineering from colleges and schools other than UCI must satisfy the University requirements for admission to advanced standing and must have completed appropriate prerequisites for the junior-level courses to be undertaken in the School. These include courses equivalent to Mathematics 2A-B-C and 3A\u00ad B-D; Engineering 10; and six science courses with labora\u00ad tories selected from Physics SA-B-C-0-E, Chemistry 61A-B (or Chemistry lA-B-C), but covering Physics SA-B-C as a minimum. (The typical equivalent at most colleges is a three\u00ad or four-semester physics sequence plus a two-semester chem\u00ad istry sequence, each for majors in those fields. Students planning to study electrical engineering at UCI need a course in modern physics that is equivalent to UCI Physics SO. If the student's physics preparation did not include such a course, Physics SD can, subsequently, be taken at UCI.) Completion of these minimum requirements does not guarantee admission to the UCI Engineering program, because enrollment limitations in various categories of Engi\u00ad neering may dictate selection based on ranking by academic proficiency. Transfer students satisfying the Statewide Articulations Agreement on Lower-Division Engineering Requirements (California Community Colleges-California State Universi\u00ad ties-University of California) may complete the remaining requirements for the B.S. degree in six quarters at UCI, assuming normal progress is maintained. Students coming from community colleges which do not offer engineering courses approve.d under this agreement should arrange for early consultation with the School's Undergraduate Student Affairs Office so that a smooth transition can be planned, including perhaps some summer courses. Advising Academic advising is available from faculty advisors, aca\u00ad demic counselors, and peer advisors. Freshmen and sopho\u00ad mores will find that most of their questions can be answered by the counselors, who also approve their programs of study, and by the peer advisors in the School's Office of Under\u00ad graduate Student Affairs. Juniors and seniors should consult regularly with their faculty advisors. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See page 12. School Requirements Credit for at least 180 quarter units composed of: Engineering Courses: Eighty-four units including: a) ElO, 70, 80, and 101, for a total of 13 units. b) Engineering courses and technical electives-an option\u00ad dependent selection of 71 units, including at most 10 units at the lower-division level. (Technical electives are defined as courses in engineering, computer science, physics, chemistry, mathematics, and biological sciences, which are designed for majors in the respective fields.) Consult programs of study forCE, EE, and ME program requirements. If none of the ac\u00ad credited options is followed, the entire segment of 71 units must be approved by the Undergraduate Studies Committee. Mathematic Courses: units plus laboratory units-no less than six courses, with laboratory where appropriate, from Physics SA-8-C-D-E, Chemistry 61A-B (or lA-B-C), and Biological Sciences lOlE. Excess units acquired through laboratory work may be assigned to Free Electives (see below). It is recommended that Engineering students Engineering 213 take more than this minimum and complete both the Physics Sand Chemistry 61 sequences. Breadth Courses: Thirty-six units-approved three-course clusters in (a) Humanistic Inquiry, (b) Social and Behavioral Sciences, and (c) Writing. At least one Writing course must be taken at the upper-division level. See pages 13-14 for the list of approved courses. Note that the remaining breadth requirements stated there are satisfied by the courses .in Mathematics and Basic Sciences specified above. Free Electives: Twelve units in any university-level academic courses. An exception is made with physical education and remedial courses which, while counting as part of a student's quarterly work load, are not applied to the 180 units required for the B.S. degree in Engineering. Duplication of Subject Material: Students who take courses which involve considerable duplication. of subject material may not receive full graduation credit for all units thus completed. Residence Requirement: In addition to the University resi\u00ad dence requirement, at least 36 upper-division engineering units specified by each option must be completed successfully at the University of California. Variations: Variations from the degree requirements may be made subject to the approval of the faculty of the School. Students wishing to obtain variances should submit petitions to the School's Undergraduate Student Affairs Office. Programs of Study A student who wishes to graduate from one of the accredited options-Civil, Electrical, or Mechanical Engineering-should select the engineering and basic science courses listed in the respective program of study. Additional information on opportunities within each option is available from faculty advisors and academic counselors. Students will work out suitable programs of study with their faculty advisors. Stu\u00ad dents must realize that they alone are responsible for the planning of their own programs and for satisfactory comple\u00ad tion of the graduation requirements. Students may substitute courses of their choosing for those required if they can substantiate the merits of the program of study and obtain the approval of the faculty of the School. Students are cautioned about the structure of prerequisites which underlies most engineering courses. The sample pro\u00ad grams shown here constitute preferred sequences which take into account all prerequisites. Students in the School of Engineering, in accordance with general campus policy, are permitted to take courses in cer\u00ad tain areas on a Pass/Not Pass basis. With respect to programs in Engineering, such areas are the breadth courses, except for courses taken in fulfillment of the UCI Writing Requirement; any nontechnical electives; and any courses not submitted as fulfilling the graduation requirement (including technical electives beyond the number required). Proficiency Examinations A student may take a course by examination with the ap\u00ad proval of the faculty member in charge of the course and the Dean of the School. Normally, ability will be demonstrated by a written or oral examination; if a portion of the capability involves laboratory exercises, the student may be required to perform experiments as well as to take a written examination. The proficiency examination is not available for any course a student has taken before or has audited at UCL UC IRVINE - 1982-1983214 Engineering Programs for Accredited Options Typical programs for the accredited options in Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering are shown below. Seniors may follow the curriculum presented in the 1981-82 General Catalogue; all others must take the courses specified for their cur\u00ad rent level and beyond. While the course sequence may be changed if there is sufficient reason, students should keep in mind that the programs are based on a rigid set of prerequisites, beginning with adequate preparation in high school mathe\u00ad matics, physics, and chemistry. Students who are not adequately prepared, or who wish to make changes for other reasons, must have their programs approved by their advisors.

Where there is a choice of courses but some courses are strongly recommended, those courses are shown in parentheses. CE electives are to be selected from approved clusters. Technical electives in the EE curriculum must include at least two design-oriented courses. Consult CE, EE, and ME curriculum guides for further details and for information on available specializations, including double options and double majors. Double Options for Environmental Engineering A significant feature of these double options is the provision for the broad interdisciplinary education necessary to deal with contemporary environmental engineering problems. The student may obtain the Environmental Engineering option from one of two possible paths-from either the Civil Engineering or Mechanical Engineering option-by satisfying additional course work from the Environmental Engineering core. By suitable choice of the courses taken as electives in either the Civil or Mechanical Engineering option, a student may complete most of the requirements for the second option in Environmental Engineering as part of the process of meeting the basic requirements for the B.S. degree in Engi\u00ad neering. Specifically, the double option requirement can be satisfied by either of the following: Civil and Environme!)tal Engineering In addition to the requirements in the Civil Engineering option, the student must successfully complete six courses from the following Engineering group: E 166; CE 161, 162; ME 110, 115, 118, 119, 120, 124, 164, 169. Mechanical and Environmental Engineering In addition to the requirements in the Mechanical Engineer\u00ad ing option, the student must successfully complete six courses from the following Engineering group: E 166; CE 120, 161, 162, 172, 173; ME 110, 118, 119, 124, 164, 169. The 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Outstanding UCI undergraduate Engineering students may enter a cooperative 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management. Students in this Program will complete their first three years in the School of Engineering and the final two years jointly in the School of Engineering and the Grad\u00ad uate School of Management. Successful completion of the requirements leads to a B.S. degree in Engineering and a l'yfaster's degree in Business Administration, Public Adminis\u00ad tration, or a combination of Business and Public Administra\u00ad tion. Students wishing to enter the 3-2 Program should con\u00ad sult with both the School of Engineering and the Graduate School of Management prior to, or early in, the junior year. Undergraduate Acceleration toward the M.S. Degree in Engineering Exceptionally promising seniors may, with permission of the Undergraduate Study Committee, take graduate-level Engi\u00ad neering courses in addition to the undergraduate degree requirements. After attaining the B.S. degree and upon acceptance to the M.S. program in Engineering, the student may petition for application of up to eight units of excess credit toward the M.S. degree. If the petition is approved by the School and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, the student could complete the M.S. degree in three quarters of residence as a graduate student even while serving as a teaching or research assistant. GRADUATE PROGRAM Graduate study is offered leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Engineering. The graduate program has concen\u00ad trations in civil, electrical, mechanical, and environmental engineering. Civil engineering focuses upon structural mechanics; transportation, planning, and urban systems; and water resources. The concentration in electrical engineering includes electronics, electro-acoustics and electro-optics, digital systems, telecommunications, control systems, and electric energy systems. Mechanical engineering specialties include heat transfer, fluid dynamics, materials, combustion, solar energy, and atmospheric processes. Environmental engineering is an interdisciplinary concentration with a focus on water quality, air resources, environmental impact, and occupational health and safety. Studies in operations research can be carried out through interdisciplinary courses offered by several academic units. Admissions For information on requirements for admission to graduate study at UCI, see page 20. Admission to graduate standing in the School of Engineering is generally accorded those pos\u00ad sessing a B.S. degree in Engineering or an allied field obtained with an acceptable level of scholarship from an institution of recognized standing. Those seeking admission without the prerequisite scholarship record may, in some cases, undertake remedial work; if completed at the stipulated academic level, UC IRVINE - 1982-1983216 Engineering they will be admitted to full graduate standing. Those ad\u00ad mitted from an allied field may be required to take supple\u00ad mentary upper-division courses in basic engineering subjects. The Graduate Record Examination Aptitude Test is required of all applicants. Master of Science in Engineering The M.S. degree is normally attained by one of two routes: Plan I, a thesis, or Plan II, a comprehensive examination. For the M.S. degree with thesis, a minimum of 36 approved units is required, of which at least 20 must be nonresearch grad\u00ad uate units (courses numbered 200-289). A maximum of eight M.S. thesis research units (296) may be submitted. The M.S. thesis must demonstrate the student's capability of undertak\u00ad ing an original study and carrying it through to a conclusion satisfactory to at least three members of the faculty. For the M.S. degree with comprehensive examination, a minimum of 36 approved units are required, of which at least 24 must be nonresearch graduate units (numbered 200-289). The detailed program of study for each M.S. student is formu\u00ad lated in consultation with an advisor who takes into consid\u00ad eration the objectives and preparation of the candidate and the specific requirements of the School. Students should acquaint themselves with core course requirements in the various concentrations of the M.S. program. The program of study must be approved by the faculty of the School. Full\u00ad time students should be able to complete the requirements for the M.S. degree in three to four quarters. Part-Time Study Those students who are employed may pursue the M.S. degree on a part-time basis, carrying fewer units per quarter. Since University residence requirements necessitate the suc\u00ad cessful completion of a minimum number of units in gradu\u00ad ate or upper-division work in each of at least three regular University quarters, the part-time student should seek the advice of the graduate student counselor in the School of Engineering and the approval of the chair of the appropriate program (CE, EE, or ME). M.S. programs must be completed in four calendar years from the date of admission. Students taking courses in University Extension should consult the section on Transfer of Courses below. Transfer of Courses Upon petition a limited number of graduate-level courses taken through University Extension, on another campus of the University, or in another accredited university may be credited toward the M.S. degree after admission. With the exception of work undertaken in another Graduate Division of the University, transfer credit will not be applied to the minimum required units in 200-series courses. For further information, see page 24. Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering The doctoral program is tailored to the individual needs and background of the student. The detailed program of study for each Ph.D. student is formulated in consultation with an advisory committee which takes into consideration the objec\u00ad tives and preparation of the candidate. The program of study must be approved by the faculty of the School. There are no specific course requirements, but there are several milestones to be passed: admission to the Ph.D. program by the faculty of the School; passage of the preliminary examination assess\u00ad ing the student's background and potential for success in the doctoral program; satisfaction of the teaching requirements required of all doctoral students; research preparation; formal advancement to candidacy; completion of a significant research investigation; and preparation and defense of an acceptable dissertation. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. For at least the final two years of the doctoral prog-ram it is expected that the student will be a full-time resident in the School. Doctoral programs must be completed in seven calendar years from the date of admission. Financial aid, such as research and teaching as\u00ad sistantships, is available.

(Master of Public Administration), M.B.P.A. (Master of Business and Public Administration), and to the Ph.D. degree in Administration. The undergraduate Concentration in Management Studies is designed for those who wish to gain some insight into issues of modern man\u00ad agement, as well as those who anticipate future graduate work in Management. The Master's degrees are professional in nature; the Ph.D. in Administration is for those who wish to pursue a career in scholarly research. The GSM Master's degree programs are intended to increase the likelihood that future leaders will be able to communicate effectively and more easily from one kind of organizational unit to another, thereby providing society with versatile managers and administrators. The Master's programs are intended to provide future man\u00ad agers with a firm foundation in the basic disciplines and in management tools and techniques. Each student in the Mas\u00ad ter's program focuses upon an institutional area and may develop expertise in one or more functional specializations. The Ph.D. program for the field of administration has aca\u00ad demic and research objectives. General Admission Requirements Evaluation of the applicant's file for admission to the Mas\u00ad ter's and Ph.D. degree programs will consist of an integrated assessment of all materials (test scores, transcripts of pre\u00ad vious academic work, statements of purpose, and letters of recommendation). There are no arbitrary cut-off points on any of the criteria for admission-rather, admission is on the basis of the total configuration of qualifications. The min\u00ad imum TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score acceptable for study at GSM is 570. Requests for application material should be addressed to the Division of Graduate Studies and Research, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92 717. Master's Degrees GSM admits students for study leading to the Master's degrees in the fall and winter quarters. The deadlines for completion of all phases of the application procedure are June 1 for the fall quarter and October 15 for the winter quarter. In addition to the general University rules governing admis\u00ad sion to graduate study, GSM normally requires the following: 1. The Graduate Management Admission Test. 2. College-level mathematics including calculus and a course in probability theory. Applicants without adequate mathemat\u00ad ical preparation may be admitted with the condition that they complete preliminary courses with a grade of B or better. These courses must be completed by the end of the second quarter in residence: Undergraduate courses in both the social sciences (e.g., economics, political science, psychology, UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Management 227 UC IRVINE - 1982-1983228 Management sociology) and information and computer sciences are strongly recommended. The Ph.D. GSM admits students for the Ph.D. in the fall quarter only; deadline for application is May 1. The Ph.D. program re\u00ad quires a commitment to full-time study. In addition to the other requirements, Ph.D. applicants are required to submit a previously prepared paper (research report, Master's thesis, essay, case study) which may be indicative generally of the applicant's interests and capabilities. Educational Objectives Three basic premises underlie the School's philosophy of generic graduate education. First, there are significant phe\u00ad nomena and problems common to business, educational, and governmental organizations; second, a common set of disci\u00ad plines, concepts, techniques, and technologies exist which are appropriate to a wide range of organizational or scholarly roles; third, many administrators in the future will work in more than one of the three arenas during their careers. Regardless of the content of particular courses, it is expected that all degree candidates will be exposed to and have the ability to use the following: General Knowledge. The broad context of organizations and management; the late twentieth century (significant trends, conditions, and problems); history of science, scientific inquiry, and the philosophy of science; economic, political, and social analysis. Conceptual and Empirical Knowledge of Organizations. Basic concepts of management; the structure and functions of organizations, including comparative analysis and inter\u00ad organizational relations; levels and units of decision making; individual behavior and group norms; operating environ\u00ad ments of organizations. Specific Knowledge of Particular Arenas of Administration. In-depth study of specific institutional environments for administrative practice, such as governmental and business organizations, and other types of organizations. Mathematics and Statistics. As tools of precise reasoning, as languages which will tend more and more to dominate pro\u00ad fessional and scholarly literature, and above all, as founda\u00ad tions for relevant quantitative methods. Technical Bases of Management. Decision processes; opera\u00ad tions research; systems and policy analysis; budgeting and accounting techniques; personnel policies; techniques for measuring and affecting attitudes and behavior; research design and strategies. Management Information Systems. Computer technology, information sciences, and basic computer applications. General Skills. Political skills, effective management of inter\u00ad personal relations, leadership strategies and tactics, and com\u00ad petence in oral, graphic, and written expression. Professional Orientations. Identification of factors, values, and policies which might bear on successful, responsible, and intellectually honest performance of organizational roles. Recognition of the administrator's potential contributions to society and of ethical and moral problems which arise from social research and the management of human enterprises. Undergraduate Concentration in Management Studies The GSM faculty and the Dean of Undergraduate Studies in cooperation with the various schools, departments, and pro-grams on campus, offer an undergraduate Concentration in Management Studies. The Concentration consists of seven courses: three Core courses that are required of all students in the Concentration, and four elective\u00b7s, two chosen from among GSM upper-division courses and two selected from specified upper-division courses in other schools on campus. Admission to the Concentration is in fall quarter only. Stu\u00ad dents must be sophomores at the time of applying and must have a minimum 3.0 grade point average both overall and in prerequisite courses. All prerequisite courses must be com\u00ad pleted prior to fall1983. Only 75 students will be admitted each year, and the selection will be based primarily on grade point average and a statement of purpose. Application dead\u00ad line is May 1; students may pick up applications, and further information, from the Graduate School of Management Office, 318 Social Science Tower. Prerequisite Courses The following courses are prerequisites for admission to the undergraduate Concentration, and must be completed prior to fall1983: Social Sciences 12A and 12B (Basic Economic Theory) Lower-division writing requirement Information and Computer Science IA (Programming and Problem Solving) or Engineering 10 (Computational Methods in Engineering) A one-quarter course selected from Social Sciences 6A, 6B, or 6C (Introduction to Political Science); 7 (introduction toPsy\u00ad chology); 8 (introduction to Sociology); or Social Ecology 59 (introduction to Human Behavior) Management lOA(Introductory Calculus) (or equivalent) Management lOB (Introductory Probability) (or equivalent) Transfer students should check with their college counselor for established equivalencies for these prerequisite courses. Concentration Core Courses The first year of the undergraduate Concentration in Man\u00ad agement Studies consists of the following three Core courses: Management 180 (Managing in Contemporary Organizations), Management 181 (Managing Organizational Behavior), and Management 183 (Managerial Decision Making). Concentration Elective Courses Four electives complete the Concentration curriculum; two must be selected from the following GSM upper-division courses, and the other two must be selected from the list of approved electives available in the GSM Office, 318 Social Science Tower. GSM Undergraduate Elective Courses (select two) Management 160 (introduction to Public Administration) Management 185 (introduction to Managerial Accounting) Management 186 (introduction to Managerial Finance) Management 187 (Introduction to Marketing) Only students admitted into the Concentration will be allowed to enroll in GSM upper-division courses. In establishing the GSM undergraduate Concentration in Management Studies, the faculty anticipated three types of students drawn to courses in administration: (1) students who wish to learn about the administration of organizations as a way of gaining appreciation for a significant aspect of the UC IRVINE - 1982-1983culture, (2) students preparing for careers in other fields that require some knowledge of administration but not a high concentration in the field, and (3) students who expect to go on to graduate work in administration and who wish early guidance and undergraduate work appropriate to this career objective. The 3-2 Program for Undergraduates In addition to the two-year Master's program for students who have already received a bachelor's degree from the Uni\u00ad versity of California or another institution, outstanding UCI undergraduate students may enter a cooperative 3-2 Pro\u00ad gram with GSM and other campus units such as the School of Social Sciences, the School of Engineering, the School of Biological Sciences, the Program in Social Ecology, or the Department of Information and Computer Science. Accep\u00ad tance into the 3-2 Program constitutes advance admission to the graduate program. Such students complete their under\u00ad graduate major requirements by the end of the junior year. During their senior year, they take graduate courses in GSM. These courses are used to satisfy their undergraduate unit requirements, and at the same time apply toward their grad\u00ad uate degrees. Successful completion of the requirements in the program normally leads to the bachelor's degree in the cooperating discipline after the fourth year, and an M.B.A., M.B.P.A., or M.P.A. degree after the fifth year. Students con\u00ad templating entering such a program should contact the Graduate School of Management prior to, or early in, the start of the junior year, for the purpose of program consultation. NOTE: With the exception of 3-2 students, no undergradu\u00ad ates will be enrolled in GSM graduate-level courses. Master's Degree Programs in GSM The Graduate School of Management offers three Master's degrees: the M.B.A. (Master of Business Administration), the M.P.A. (Master of Public Administration), and the M.B.P.A. (Master of Business and Public Administration). All three require a minimum of 23 quarter courses (92 units) with a minimum overall grade point average of 3.0 in Core, Tier II, and elective courses. The Master's degree programs normally take two full aca\u00ad demic years or their equivalent in part-time registration. Students with substantial personal or professional commit\u00ad ments normally take two courses per quarter and are required to complete the Master's degree in no more than four years. To accommodate the needs of these students, GSM offers a number of courses each quarter during the late afternoon and evening hours. Students who cannot take courses in the late afternoon (after 4:00p.m.) may not be able to complete the program successfully. There is no thesis required. The courses in the Master's degree programs are divided into three groups, each group designed to achieve specific educational objectives. The courses are divided as fol\u00ad lows: Tier I, Common Core Courses, which are required of all Master's degree students; Tier II B courses, which are required for the M.B.A. degree; and Tier II P courses, which are required for the M.P.A. degree. For the M.B.P.A. degree, the student is required to take all of Tier II B and II P courses. The balance of the minimum required 23 courses will consist of electives. Master's students often select electives to emphasize one or a combination of the following: management information sys\u00ad tems, accounting, public policy management, corporate plan\u00ad ning, marketing, operations management, public financial management, organizational behavior, or management of high technology enterprises. Management 229 Tier I Common Core Courses The first group consists of 10 Core courses (Tier I) taken by all Master's degree students. The Core has two fundamental aims: (1) to develop skills needed to select and use effectively the appropriate means, methods, and techniques for diagnos\u00ad ing and solving organizational problems; (2) to identify the significant concepts and phenomena associated with the study of complex organizations, and to bring to bear the rele\u00ad vant contributions of the core disciplines on the analysis of organizations and the administrative processes. Tier I Common Core Courses, each of which is four units, are: Management of Complex Organizations, Quantitative Methods for Management, either Quantitative Methods for Management II, or Statistics for Management, Organizational Analysis for Management, Accounting Information for Man\u00ad agement, Microeconomics for Management, Macroeconomics for Management, Political Analysis for Management, Com\u00ad puter and Information Systems for Management, Public/Pri\u00ad vate Interactions. Specialization in Business Management, Public Management, or Business and Public Management Students pursuing the M.B.A. are required to take all four Tier II B courses: Business Strategy, Marketing for Manage\u00ad ment, Corporate Finance, and Production Management. Stu\u00ad dents pursuing the M.P.A. are required to take all four Tier II P courses: Public Policy Making, Public Policy Analysis, Public Financial Analysis, and Public Productivity Management. Students pursuing the M.B.P.A. are required to take all eight of the Tier II courses. Tier II courses are designed to increase the students' skills in the particular arena they wish to enter, as well as to present them with the problems .and options common to high-level managers. The separation of the M.B.A. and M.P.A. degrees allows for a certain amount of specialization; the M.B.P.A. degree is structured to present the widest view of the interface between public and private management. Elective Courses The remaining coursework for the Master's degrees will con\u00ad sist of either nine additional electives for the M.B.A. or M.P.A. degrees, or five electives for the M.B.P.A. degree. The major emphasis in the elective courses will be to develop additional depth in a discipline or interdisciplinary area or specialized competence in the use of a particular set of tech\u00ad nical tools and methods. The student will select the electives in light of the student's educational and career goals and interests. Management Internship Program To complement the academic curriculum of GSM, a Man\u00ad agement Internship Program provides practical application and work experience to selected GSM Master's students. Student interns are employed in administrative positions by local cooperating organizations. Course credit is available for participants in the Internship Program through the course \"Management Internship Seminar.\" GSM faculty and organi\u00ad zational representatives as well as student interns participate in this seminar which deals with specific topics and projects encountered by the interns in their positions. Special Opportunities Opportunities for students to take part in ongoing research exist through two University-wide research units based on the Irvine campus. Through the Public Policy Research Organization (PPRO) a student may participate in research on significant public policy issues. Current projects include a nationwide study of local government information systems. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983230 Management The Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS) conducts research in the areas of urban transportation policy and planning, transit management and labor relations, and trans\u00ad portation system evaluation. Students interested in these areas may have an opportunity to work on an ITS project. Doctor of Philosophy in Administration GSM offers the Ph.D. in Administration to students with backgrounds in a variety of disciplines. While a master's degree is preferred, students may be admitted to the doctoral program directly from the baccalaureate degree. There are many appropriate undergraduate majors, including (but not limited to) industrial or behavioral psychology, political science, business or public administration, mathematics, com\u00ad puter sciences, economics, sociology, and so forth. Students with strengths in the humanities and aptitudes in mathemat\u00ad ics are encouraged to apply. The Ph.D. program is designed to prepare students for academic careers in a number of the fields of management, e.g., organizational behavior, opera\u00ad tions research, marketing, public policy, finance, business pol\u00ad icy, or management information systems. Requirements of the Ph.D. program include a broad knowledge of core disci\u00ad plines as represented by the 14 core courses of the Master's degree program. In addition, the Ph.D. student must qualify as a skilled researcher and must complete a significant exer\u00ad cise demonstrating these skills. GSM normally admits doctoral students for the fall quarter ony; however, admission for a quarter other than fall will be considered under exceptional circumstances. Although there is considerable variation in the length of time beyond a Master's degree needed to complete the Ph.D., a realistic range is three to five years. The Ph.D. program is divided into three phases: preliminary, qualification, and dissertation. The preliminary phase (which must be completed within six quarters) is designed to ensure that all Ph.D. students have (I) a thorough knowledge of core materials; (2) knowledge of how to conduct research; and (3) a depth of knowledge in a basic discipline or tool relevant to administration (e.g., deci\u00ad sion sciences, behavioral science models for administration). In the qualification phase the student prepares for disserta\u00ad tion research in an area of specialization. This phase is com\u00ad pleted when an oral qualifying examination is passed and the candidacy committee recommends advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. There are no foreign language requirements in the GSM Ph.D. program. The dissertation phase involves a significant original research project which demonstrates the Ph.D. student's creativity and ability to launch and sustain a career of research. The dissertation attests to the scholarly objectives of the degree program. UNDERGRADUATE COURSES lOA Basic Quantitative Methods for Management (4) W, Summer. Preprofessional quantitative course.

The primary activity of the Office is offering programs which lead to credentials required by those who teach, counsel, or administer in the public and private schools of California. Faculty associated with the Office of Teacher Education include distinguished scholars, researchers, and authors of national or international reputation. Most faculty have them-Teacher Education 233 selves taught or served as administrators in public or private schools, and all have shown commitment to the continued improvement of education through the processes of profes\u00ad sional study, the development of new approaches to teaching, and the design or publication of innovative and scholarly courses of study. The Office of Teacher Education is organized around the credential programs it offers. Faculty members generally are associated with the credential program representing their areas of expertise and interest. The program provides oppor\u00ad tunities for interaction among students and faculty who share common interests. CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS The Office of Teacher Education offers programs which lead to California teaching credentials as established by the Teacher Preparation and Licensing Law of 1970, known gen\u00ad erally as the Ryan Act. In addition, programs leading to two nonteaching credentials, the Pupil Personnel Services Cre\u00ad dential and the Administrative Services Credential, are offered. It is possible for a student concurrently to complete the requirements for a credential and to earn a graduate aca\u00ad demic degree. This requires admission to the Teacher Educa\u00ad tion program and the graduate program in which the degree will be sought. There are two basic teaching credentials in California: the Single Subject Credential and the Multiple Subject Creden\u00ad tial. They are called basic because all other teaching and most nonteaching credentials have one of these two credentials as prerequisites. Teaching credentials authorized by the 1970 credential law are not determined by grade level (i.e., elementary and secondary) but by the type of instructional situation (multiple or single subject). Each credential carries K-12 authorization. These credentials are awarded by the Commission for Teacher Preparation and Licensing upon recommendation of the UCI Office of Teacher Education and are required in order to teach or serve in a professional capacity in any public school in California. Single Subject Instruction Credential \"Single subject instruction\" means the practice of assignment of teachers to specified subject matter courses, as is com\u00ad monly practiced in California high schools and junior high schools. Teachers who are authorized for single subject instruction may be assigned, with their consent, to teach any subject in the authorized fields, at any grade level, but nor- , mally in a departmentalized secondary school. UCI is approved for this credential. Single Subject Instruction Cre\u00ad dentials are authorized by the State of California in art, busi\u00ad ness, English, history, home economics, industrial arts, for\u00ad eign languages, mathematics, music, physical education, social science, life science, physical science, agriculture, govern\u00ad ment, and health science. Candidates who enroll in the Single Subject Credential pro\u00ad gram at UCI generally are required to take the following courses: Education 101; Education 102-the students enroll in the section of their major; Education 1058; Education 105LB; Education 162 (usually taken tion 173; Education 174; Education 320A-B-C-D-E; Education 360; UC IRVINE - 1982-1983234 Teacher Education Sample Fifth-Year Program-Single Subject Credential Fall Ed 101 Winter Ed 320A, B Spring Ed 173 Ed 102 Ed 360 Ed 320C,D,E Ed 105B/LB Ed 380 Ed 174 Multiple Subject Instruction Credential \"Multiple subject instruction\" means the practice of assign\u00ad ment of teachers to multiple subject matter instruction, as is commonly practiced in California elementary schools. Teach\u00ad ers who are authorized for multiple subject instruction may be assigned, with their consent, to teach in any self-contained classroom: preschool, kindergarten, and grades 1-12 inclusive, but normally the assignment is in the elementary school. UCI is approved for this credential. Candidates who enroll in the Multiple Subject Credential program at UCI generally are required to take the following courses: Education 105A; Education 105LA; Education 110A\u00ad B; Subject Credential Fall Ed 105A/LA Winter Ed 300A,B Spring Ed 173 Ed 110A/B Ed 360 Ed 300C,D,E Ed 174 Ed 380 Candidates desiring both Single and Multiple Subject Cre\u00ad dentials may apply the basic professional courses of Educa\u00ad tion 105A, 105LA, 173, 174, 360, and 380 toward both cre\u00ad dentials, but must complete Education 101, 102, 110A-B, do student teaching in both areas, and demonstrate competence by passing appropriate State-mandated subject field examina\u00ad tions where needed. Intern Teaching Credential Program Through the intern program, a student may earn a stipend for one year of teaching while completing either the Multiple or Single Subject Credential. To hold an Intern Teaching Credential in a school district, the student must be enrolled as a postbaccalaureate student in the Office of Teacher Edu\u00ad cation. Teacher candidates are selected by participating schools and the University based on the background and experience of the teacher candidate, the needs of the particu\u00ad lar school, and the candidate's eligibility for the University's Teacher Education program. The stipend is paid by the school district. The number of internships varies from year to year. For further information see the intern secretary in the Office of Teacher Education. For thE\\ Special Education Intern Teach\u00ad ing Credential, see Specialist Credentials. Specialist Credentials The Specialist Credential is a credential on top of a credential. It authorizes teaching in the specific specialization area at any grade level from preschool through grade 12. In order to qualify for this credential, the applicant must have a valid basic teaching credential (either the Single Subject or Multi\u00ad ple Subject Credential) and complete a specialized program of professional preparation in an approved program. In the State of California there are seven specialist credential cate\u00ad gories: early childhood, bilingual/cross-cultural, mathematics, reading, agriculture, health science, and special education. UCI offers preparation for Specialist Credentials in early childhood education and in the special education areas of the learning handicapped, the physically handicapped, and the severely handicapped. Students interested in the details about Specialist Credentials should make an appointment for pro-gram counseling with the academic advisor in the Office of Teacher Education. Early Childhood Education Specialist Credential. The Early Childhood Education Specialist Credential is a specialization on top of a basic Multiple Subject Instruction Credential. If the student can complete all the work, the student can obtain a preliminary teaching credential and an Early Childhood Specialist Credential with the B.A., but it is not likely. In nearly every instance it will be obtained as a result of the fifth-year program. Special Education Specialist Credentials. UCI is approved for three areas of the Special Education Specialist Credential: Learning Handicapped, Physically Handicapped, and Severely Handicapped. Special Education Intern Specialist Credential. UCI offers an intern teaching credential in each of its three approved areas in special education. The intern teacher becomes a teacher of record if the following requirements can be met: The student must be enrolled in the UCI credential program for an entire academic year, and must hold a basic teaching credential. The student must have completed the generic courses required for either the Learning Handicapped, Physically Handicapped, or Severely Handicapped Specialist Credential which includes Education 160, 161, 162, 163, and 184B (equivalency credit can be used for certain of these generic requirements). Finally, the student must have a contract offer from a public school district. The Resource Specialist Certificate of Competence. The Resource Specialist Certificate of Competence requires pos\u00ad session of a valid Special Education Credential, and three or more years of teaching experience, including both regular and special education teaching experience. A clear Resource Specialist Certificate of Competence authorizes service only if a valid Special Education Credential, other than an emer\u00ad gency credential, is held concurrently. The UCI program lead\u00ad ing to the clear Resource Specialist Certificate of Competence is a 16 quarter-unit program divided into 'four courses, and followed by an exit assessment. Bilingual!Cross-Cultural Emphasis The Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis is a specialization in addition to a regular teaching credential. This means that a candidate must fulfill all the necessary requirements for a basic teaching credential whether this be with a Single Sub\u00ad ject orientation for high school or a Multiple Subject orienta\u00ad tion for elementary school. The Irvine program is limited to the development of a bilingual capacity in Spanish only as the second language. At UCI the Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers a B.A. with a Bilingualism and English as a Second Language Emphasis. By acquiring this undergraduate major, the stu\u00ad dent will complete a significant part of the specific require\u00ad ments for a Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis. This is the best kind of preparation for going into the program leading to a Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis. Services Credential The Ryan Act provides for five categories of nonteaching credentials which authorize their holders to provide specific nonclassroom services to public schools. Services Credentials are issued by the State in pupil personnel services, adminis\u00ad trative services, health services, library services, and clinical\u00ad rehabilitative services. UCI offers programs which lead to the Administrative Services Credential, generally required by school administrators, and the Pupil Personnel Services Cre\u00ad dential, sought by school counselors. Both credentials are UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Teacher Education 235 UC IRVINE - 1982-1983236 Teacher Education effective for grades K-12. At UCI the Pupil Personnel Ser\u00ad vices Credential requires a basic teaching credential or a Mas\u00ad ter's degree in Social Ecology. The Administrative Services Credential requires the basic teaching credential, a Master's degree, and three years of acceptable full-time teaching experience. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY One of the above patterns will prevail for all candidates. The primary option will be the status of the candidate (under\u00ad graduate or postbaccalaureate) at entry. Any program can be completed with one year of full-time postbaccalaureate study, but only a few can be pursued in an undergraduate\u00b7program. Field experience, including student teaching, is offered in the regular four-year undergraduate program or during the fifth-year program. It should be started in the freshman or sophomore year. The Office of Teacher Education program suggests two field experiences prior to entering into student teaching. One such experience might be a tutoring assignment during the fresh\u00ad man or sophomore year and another might be serving as a teacher's aide in the junior year. There are numerous options for this field experience. Each field experience program is a cooperative arrangement between the University and the public school districts to help provide UCI students with experience that will prepare them for their future work as teachers. The field experience can come from any one of sev\u00ad eral academic areas in which students work in public schools under supervision of an experienced teacher in the school and with a University supervisor. As a tutor, the college student usually works with the public school student on a one-to-one basis. As a teacher's aide, the student typically works for a block of time per week for one quarter with a teacher in the classroom. During this time students are given a variety of opportunities to help the experienced teacher enrich the course of study and to participate within the classroom. Ultimately it is in the classroom where the problems of teach\u00ad ing are either solved or ignored; hence here is where teacher preparation begins. This experience will assist the UCI stu\u00ad dent in making a more rea]istic vocational choice. It also involves the public school in the selection of future student teachers. An additional field experience of one unit value will be required of all students in Education 174, and this involve\u00ad ment must be in multicultural areas. Admission to the Teacher Education Program All students are welcome to apply for admission to the Teacher Education p.rogram. Admission is based on a broad index: Academic Achievement. Completion of a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution and a grade point aver\u00ad age of 3.0 will support admission to the Teacher Education program at UCI. (Undergraduates who enroll in courses lead\u00ad ing to credentials still must be admitted to a fifth year of study-to be described later.) For information and an applica\u00ad tion, contact the Division of Graduate Studies and Research, 145 Administration. . Absence of Criminal Conviction that Would Preclude the Issuance of a Credential. All students are required by law to obtain a certificate of clearance from the Commission for Teacher Preparation and Licensing prior to beginning student teaching. This process is primarily a fingerprint check to determine that the student is clear of criminal conviction. See a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for advice on how to handle this process. Interview. An Admissions Committee is available to meet with prospective students. All admitted to the program will have a personal interview with a member or members of the Committee. Written Recommendations. Three letters of recommendation for admission are required. Such recommendations should indicate the student's ability to perform graduate-level work. Admission. Both the UCI academic department correspond\u00ad ing to the student's academic major and the Office of Teacher Education must recommend the admission of applicants for the Single Subject Instruction Credential. The applicant's record is reviewed first by the academic department and then by the Admissions Committee of the Office of Teacher Education. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR THE TEACHING CREDENTIAL The minimum requirements for the teaching credential in California are established by California state law. Require\u00ad ments include: 1. A baccalaureate or higher degree, in an area other than professional education, from an approved institution. 2. An approved program of professional preparation. This means a sequence of education courses, including an ali-day, full-time assignment of a semester's duration in student teaching. 3. Passage of a subject matter examination or its waiver via an approved academic program. UCI academic programs are approved for most examination waivers; but students should seek counsel from Teacher Education to ensure that they are enrolled in an approved waiver program. 4. Under certain conditions the passage of the College Level Examination Program is required. See a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for advice. 5. Demonstration of a knowledge of the various methods of teaching reading as validated by successful completion of a program of study. (Industrial arts, physical education, music, art, and home economics are exempt from this requirement.) 6. A course or an examination covering the U.S. Constitution. 7. A fifth year of study is still required, even though a stu\u00ad dent may elect to start or complete the approved program of professional preparation as an undergraduate. The Approved Program of Professional Preparation This program refers to education courses required for the teaching credential. UCI defines the approved program as consisting of 19 quarter units, plus student teaching. Six quarter units of this instruction are required in the teaching of reading. The professional preparation will contribute effectively to the experience, performance, and excellence of the candidates. The understandings and competencies in each of the required courses are attained through the provision of a wide variety of experiences designed to be most effective in providing the competency. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Passage of a Subject Matter Examination Single Subject Examinations. California requires all students to pass the National Teachers Examination (NTE) in the area of their teaching majors except where particular institutions have developed an approved major which waives the NTE. All UCI academic majors which are commonly taught in the public schools have been waived in lieu of the National Teachers Examination. However, in some majors there are certain requirements that a student must complete while ful\u00ad filling the major in order to receive this waiver. Students should consult a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for detailed information. Supplementary Authorization. Teaching minors by that name no longer exist, but it is possible to add further teach\u00ad ing authorizations beyond the single subject major. Students deciding to be credentialed in more than one subject area may qualify to do so in either of two ways: I. Students may complete 30 quarter units (15 units if they are upper-division) in collegiate-level course work to be used to develop a supplementary authorization to teach in areas differing from the single subject major. Consult a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for details. 2. Students may pass the National Teachers Examination in any area of their choice and thus qualify for the additional authorization in that subject. Multiple Subject Examinations. A general subject matter examination authorizing teaching multiple subjects includes an examination of the candidate's knowledge of the following areas: English, social science, fine arts, science, and mathe\u00ad matics. The UCI program for the Multiple Subject Teaching Credential is approved for waiver of the examination if the student completes the required diversified program. The examination can be taken as often as necessary but should not be taken prior to the junior year. Requirements in Academic Areas for Waiver of Examination in the Multiple Subject Examinations. Of the student's total undergraduate program, 128 quarter hours are required to be divided as follows: Nine courses (36 quarter units) in two of the following areas and seven courses (28 quarter units) in the other two: a. English (including grammar, literature, advanced com\u00ad position, and speech) \u00b7 b. Social science and history (must have courses in each) c. Mathematics and science (must have courses in each with a minimum of three in mathematics) d. Fine arts, foreign language, and philosophy Since the academic major on the UCI campus will normally fulfill one of the four areas above and the UCI breadth requirement applies to the others, meeting the four require\u00ad ments is possible if planned early in the student's career. Fifth-Year Requirement The UCI Teacher Education program defines the fifth year as 45 quarter units of upper-division or graduate-level work taken after the bachelor's degree is granted. In each instance the fifth year will consist of a program, individually deter\u00ad mined and based upon the assessed needs of the student, and where applicable (for example, in the Intern Program), by the hiring school district. Regardless of courses completed prior to the bachelor's degree, students must complete a fifth year to obtain a clear teaching credential. In addition to the approved program Teacher Education 237 listed above for the Multiple or Single Subject Instruction Credentials, the fifth year must include the following: I. Completion of 45 quarter units 2. Completion of the following courses: a. Education 162, Psychology and Education of the Excep\u00ad tional Child b. Education 360, Synthesis of the Professional Commitment c. Education 380, Health Education for Teachers Provision for a Student Teaching Experience Twenty quarter units of student teaching are defined as a full-day, five-day-per-week assignment, for 18 weeks in the appropriate classroom training environment. Evaluation will be based on performance, excellence in instruction, and pro\u00ad fessional maturity. These factors will be assessed by the resi\u00ad dent teacher, the University supervisor, and the candidate. If competence has been demonstrated by the conclusion of the student teaching program and all other requirements are met, the student qualifies for recommendation for credential certification by UCI. Multiple Subject Instruction candidates will be assigned in grades K-8. The assignment may be split to include two lev\u00ad els within this range. Single Subject Instruction candidates will be assigned in grades 7-12. The assignment may be split to include two lev\u00ad els within this range. The student teaching situation requires the student to be in the school the full day for a full semester, the same as the regular teacher, including faculty meetings, parent confer\u00ad ences, and sponsorship of events. It is a joint responsibility of UCI and the school districts to guarantee that each student will have student teaching expe\u00ad rience in a multicultural or cross-cultural situation. There is no concurrent course work required of student teachers during student teaching, but a weekly seminar is held as a part of the total student teaching program. Many students, however, do choose to take courses in addition to student teaching, if courses are offered late in the day. Clear\u00ad ances for student teaching are processed by the Office of Teacher Education and are contingent upon the certificate of clearance, a current health clearance, and academic prepara\u00ad tion clearances. A student must apply for a student teaching assignment the quarter before student teaching. Students are to consult the Office of Teacher Education for appropriate information, Under the present program a student can be authorized to teach in California prior to the completion of the fifth year. A student can be granted a preliminary credential upon comple\u00ad tion of the baccalaureate, the professional education se\u00ad quence, a course in the teaching of reading, student teaching, a course or examination covering the U.S. Constitution, and where necessary, by passing the National Teachers Examina\u00ad tion as required by the Ryan Act. (Contact the Office of Teacher Education for information on the National Teachers Examination.) However, the fifth year must be completed within five years after the preliminary credential is issued. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983238 Teacher Education Preliminary, Clear, and Life Credentials Multiple and Single Subject Credentials are of three types: The Preliminary Credential. The Preliminary Credential is aw;irded by the State upon completion of the approved pro\u00ad gram. This can be done in the undergraduate program and is contingent upon possession of the baccalaureate degree. Before the recommendation for the Preliminary Credential can be made, the student must have completed (or demon\u00ad strate equivalent credit for) the Multiple Subject Instruction Credential: Education 105A, 105LA, llOA-B, 173-174; for the Credential: Education 101, 102, 1058, 105LB, 173-174. The Clear Credential. The Clear Credential cannot be awarded by the State until the completion of (a) a baccalau\u00ad reate degree, (b) an approved program, and (c) a fifth year. The Life Credential. The Life Credential can be awarded by the State upon completion of all requirements for the Clear Credential plus a certain number of years (usually two or three) teaching in California public schools.

Currently, 92 students are admitted each year. The College of Medicine is dedicated to advancing the knowledge and practice of medicine for the benefit of society. This mission is being achieved through the accom\u00ad plishment of the following complementary and synergistic objectives: \u00b7 Scholarly research of the highest quality to further the understanding of human biology and the diagnosis, treat\u00ad ment, and prevention of disease. Education of physicians who meet the highest standards of professional competence and achievement. Development of scholars in the clinical and basic sciences who will assume leadership roles in medical practice, educa\u00ad tion, and research. Provision of high-quality medical care to patients through the UCI Clinical Services System that will serve as a model of excellence. Dissemination of the results of advances in medical research and practice. FACILITIES The basic medical science instructional programs are located in modern, well-equipped buildings on the Irvine campus. Medicine 249 These buildings also house the College of Medicine adminis\u00ad tration and many of the research laboratories and classrooms. In addition, facilities on the Irvine campus include two amphitheater-style lecture halls, the Biomedical Library, and a student lounge/activity center. The UCI Clinical Services System is comprised of the UCI Medical Center, two community clinics in areas of need within Orange County, and numerous affiliated hospitals and clinics in Orange County, in southern Los Angeles County, and in outlying areas. Its goal is to provide high quality medi\u00ad cal care to the community while maintaining an environment of quality medical education and research. The UCI Medical Center provides a full range of medical and mental health experiences to medical students and residents, while the community clinics concentrate on the primary care special\u00ad ties, and the affiliated institutions provide clinical training in specific specialities. Plans have been formulated for an on\u00ad campus ambulatory care clinic which will provide primary care services to the Irvine area and specialty services to a large geographic area. UCI Medical Center The University of California Irvine Medical Center (UCIMC), located in the City of Orange, is a 493-bed, comprehensive medical care center. It is the principal clinical facility of the College of Medicine operated by the University. The medical faculty of the College of Medicine, together with the medical resident-physician staff, provide the professional care at the Medical Center. Services provided include: medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry, family medi\u00ad cine, pathology, radiology, anesthesiology, and dentis\u00ad try. The Medical Center also has cardiac, pediatric, neonatal, respiratory, burn, and general intensive care units, and more than 90 specialty outpatient clinics. The Medical Center is also the designated countywide Level I tertiary trauma refer\u00ad ral center. A six-level patient care unit, the Medical Center Tower, opened recently. It is part of a major redevelopment program that includes the renovation of existing buildings and the construction of new facilities, including a medical library building. UCI Community Clinics Two University-operated clinics are located in Orange County. The Community Clinic of Orange County (CCOC), located in the City of Santa Ana, is the home of the Depart\u00ad ment of Family Medicine residency program. The Clinic cur\u00ad rently provides comprehensive care for 25,000 outpatients annually. The North Orange County Community Clinic (NOCCC) currently serves 6,900 outpatients annually and is located in the City of Anaheim. The affiliated Clinica Sierra Vista, in Lamont, California, provides an educational expe\u00ad rience in rural medicine. Affiliated Hospitals and Clinics Additional major teaching and research programs of the UCI\u00ad California College of Medicine are conducted at the Veterans Administration Medical Center, Long Beach, and at Memori\u00ad al Hospital Medical Center, Long Beach. Other academic pro\u00ad grams are conducted in affiliation with Childrens Hospital of Orange County, Fairview State Hospital, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, La Habra Community Hospital, Metropolitan State Hospital (a psychiatric hospital in Norwalk), St. Joseph Hospi\u00ad tal, St. Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center, the United States Naval Regional Medical Center in Long Beach, The UC IRVINE - 1982-1983250 Medicine City of Hope Medical Center, Rancho Los Amigos Hospital, and Capistrano by the Sea Hospital. The Clfnica Sierra Vista in Lamont (Kern County) and Clfnicas de Salud del Pueblo in Calexico (Imperial County) are also affiliated. ADMISSION TO THE M.D. PROGRAM Students are eligible to apply for admission upon completion of the premedical requirements of the College of Medicine described below. Preference is given to applicants who will have completed the bachelor's degree by the time of entrance.

Information regarding registration, rules and regulations, grading procedures, requirements for academic advancement, and other facts will be provided to students in the medical student handbook. Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education The College of Medicine participates in the student exchange program of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, under which qualified legal residents of Western states without medical schools are considered along with California residents, and these states of origin reimburse the UC IRVINE - 1982-1983State of California for the costs of their education. These states are Alaska, Montana, and Wyoming. To be eligible for this program, students must apply to the WICHE certifying officers in their own states. For addresses of certifying offi\u00ad cers, write to the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, P.O. Drawer P, Boulder, Colorado 80302. Admission to Advanced Standing In some years, the College of Medicine has a limited number of openings for transfer students. Applicants who have com\u00ad pleted the equivalent of the first two years of the UCI\u00ad California College of Medicine curriculum will be considered by the Admissions Committee for admission to levels more advanced than the regular entering class level but not beyond the beginning of the third year. Applicants from U.S. medical schools are required to pass successfully Part I of the National Board Medical Examiners test. Foreign medical school applicants are required to pass successfully the Medical Science Knowledge Profile Examina\u00ad tion, and they may be offered a conditional acceptance which would enable them to take Part I of the National Boards. Col\u00ad lege of Medicine policy requires passage of Part I of the National Boards for matriculation to the third year. Appli\u00ad cants accepted on a conditional basis who do not pass the National Boards will have their conditional acceptance with\u00ad drawn on the basis of their not having fulfilled the require\u00ad ments for admission to advanced standing. Those interested in applying should contact the Office of Admissions, Medical Student Affairs, UCI-California College of Medicine, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, Califor\u00ad nia 92717 for applications and further information. Applica\u00ad tions can be made up to March 15 of the year in which admission is sought. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE M.D. DEGREE Each medical student must satisfactorily complete the re\u00ad quired basic medical sciences, preclinical sciences, and clinical sciences courses of instruction, as well as acceptable electives. Passage of Part I and Part II of the National Boards is re\u00ad quired. Part I must be passed before a student may progress beyond quintile 9. Part II must be passed prior to graduation. Upon recommendation of the faculty and with the Dean's concurrence, the student is awarded the M.D. degree. MEDICAL CURRICULUM The M.D. curriculum requires four years to complete. If spe\u00ad cial needs are identified, the time may be extended to five years. This latter option is advantageous to those students who wish to pursue an M.D./Ph.D. program, to those who feel they have educational deficiencies, or to those who have other impelling demands on their time. The instructional year is divided into quintiles (fifths) of 9-11 weeks each, and the program is composed of 17 instructional quintiles. The instructional quintiles and courses of study are grouped as follows: Basic Medical Sciences (Quintiles 1-5) During quintiles 1-5, no more than six hours of instruction are scheduled per day, and of these six hours, no more than four are formal lectures. Gross Anatomy; Embryology; Histology; Neuroanatomy. The language of medicine is taught by studies of gross human anatomy, human neuroanatomy, embryology, and normal microscopic anatomy. Gross anatomy is taught through a regional approach with heavy emphasis on labora\u00ad tory dissection augmented by lectures, demonstrations (radi-Medicine 251 agraphic films), and teaching aids. Neuroanatomy is func\u00ad tionally oriented and emphasizes both laboratory and lecture material. Microscopic anatomy is designed to provide stu\u00ad dents with knowledge of cellular morphology and function in preparation for studies in pathology. All courses in anatomy are given a clinical orientation. Biochemistry. The fundamentals of classical and molecular biochemistry are covered, including the structure, function, and biosynthesis of macromolecules and metabolic interrela\u00ad tions. The molecular mechanisms for regulation at the transcriptional, translational, posttranslational, and enzymatic levels are emphasized. Behavioral Sciences I and II. The ultimate goal of the curric\u00ad ulum is for the student to learn the behavioral aspects of medicine as they apply to general medical and surgical prac\u00ad tice. The areas covered are the basic science of neurobiology, somatopsychic issues, interpersonal (doctor-patient) rela\u00ad tionships, and psychopathology. Behavioral Sciences I covers normal human development, the basics of the doctor-patient relationship, basic interviewing techniques, and behavioral neuroanatomy and neurochemistry. Behavioral Sciences II covers human sexuality, psychopathology, alcoholism, and drug abuse. It also covers psychosocial aspects of medical and surgical disease. The courses consist of readings, lectures, and small group discussions. Students also have their first expo\u00ad sure to patients and learn the basics of the interview. In Behavioral Sciences I the emphasis is on interviewing \"nor\u00ad mal\" people; in Behavioral Sciences II the student learns how to assess pathology. Physiology. The course consists of lecture, tutorial, and audio-visual presentations of the classical concepts of verte\u00ad brate physiology, with emphasis on the function of normal tissues in man. Specific topics related to neurological, cardio\u00ad vascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, exer\u00ad cise, and temperature regulation are presented. Microbiology. This course deals with the biochemical and genetic properties of infectious agents, activities of toxins, chemotherapy, and the biochemistry and genetics of antibio\u00ad tic resistance. A considerable portion of the course deals with the humoral and cellular basis of immunity and the genetic control of the immune response. The course also includes an in-depth study of the biology of parasites and the structure and activity of viruses. Community and Environmental Medicine. This course con\u00ad sists of five main segments: biostatistics, epidemiology, pre- . ventive medicine, legal medicine, and environmental and occupational medicine. The primary segment, epidemiology, is presented in formal lectures and laboratory sessions. Methods are given for evaluating the distribution and possi\u00ad ble causation of acute and chronic diseases, including infec\u00ad tious and noninfectious diseases, in human populations. Preclinical Sciences (Quintiles 6-8) During quintiles 6-8, no more than seven hours of instruc\u00ad tion will be scheduled each day, and of these no more than four will be formal lecture. Pharmacology. The preclinical course in pharmacology deals with drugs of various classifications that are used for specific or symptomatic therapies of disease states. Emphasis is on the mechanisms of action of drugs at the organ or system level and bn their use in medical therapy. This course includes lectures and laboratory demonstrations that illus\u00ad trate pharmacologic principles, supplemented by small group discussion sessions. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983252 Medicine Pathology. Theoretical aspects of pathological processes are presented to provide an orientation to disease mechanisms which are correlated with practical laboratory work. Disease is presented as a dynamic process that affects the organism at molecular, cellular, tissue, and organ levels. Examination of Patient. Basic instruction and experience are offered in the elements of physical diagnosis and patient interviews. Mechanisms of Disease. An organ system approach is util\u00ad ized in presenting the basic mechanisms and manifestations of disease. Introduction to Medicine. This course introduces students to comprehensive work-ups of their own patients, including his\u00ad tory, complete physical examination of all organ systems, and differential diagnostic analysis and interpretation. Introduction to Obstetrics and Gynecology. This course pre\u00ad pares students for the third-year obstetrics and gynecology clerkship. Introduction to Surgery. In order to attain the maximum benefit from the basic surgical course, students are oriented to the method, approach, and history of surgery and to spe\u00ad cific surgical problems. Clinical Sciences (Quintiles 9-17) The clinical experience is composed of clerkship rotations, with a specific allotment of time emphasizing primary care and continuity of care. Sequencing of clerkships is deter\u00ad mined by the Office of Admissions. One and one-half quin\u00ad tiles are undesignated, and students may take electives that suit their particular interests, needs, and goals. These courses must be approved by the student's advisor and the Office of Records and, by petition, a number may be taken at institu\u00ad tions other than UCI. Anesthesiology. During the anesthesiology clerkship, stu\u00ad dents receive instruction in the basic principles of general and regional anesthesia, including the pharmacology of anesthetic drugs, basic respiratory and cardiovascular physiology, airway management, preoperative evaluation of patients, surgical anesthesia, fluid balance, hazards of anesthesia; postanesthe\u00ad sia recovery care, resuscitation, and the management of piratory emergencies and comatose states. A two-week elec\u00ad tive is offered in which students gain familiarity with the technical aspects of anesthesia by spending a portion of each day in the operating room and by participating in supervised \"hands-on\" patient care. Theoretical aspects of the specialty are covered in daily tutorial sessions with the faculty, and students attend departmental clinical conferences which are devoted to presentation and discussion of interesting cases and complications. Special rotations through the Veterans Administration Medical Center, Long Beach-Surgical Inten\u00ad sive Care Unit are offered but must be arranged through the department chair; the student must have at least one week on clinical anesthesia as a prerequisite for the elective. Medicine. Students are taught the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic approach to commonly encountered medical illnesses with the intent that, in addition to scientific aspects of medical diagnosis and therapy, they will develop an appre\u00ad ciation for the importance of psychosocial-economic factors in the care of the patient. Experience is provided with com\u00ad mon medical procedures such as lumbar puncture, insertion of catheters, and thoracentesis. The student is expected to assume increasing responsibility for hospitalized patients and to develop an approach to patients' problems which includes references to the appropriate medical literature. Neurosciences. A combined effort of neurology and neuro\u00ad surgery, the clinical neurosciences clerkship emphasizes the development of student skills in neurological examination as well as the medical and surgical management of patients with brain, nerve, and muscle disease. Obstetrics and Gynecology. During this clerkship students are taught the scientific basis of gynecology and obstetrics, including reproductive physiology, anatomy, fetal physiology, and pathology. Practical experience is offered in the manage\u00ad ment of normal and abnormal pregnancy and delivery. Instruction is given in office and surgical gynecology. Stu\u00ad dents who have completed an introductory clerkship may then apply for an advanced elective that allows a progression of clinical responsibility both in operative obstetrics and office gynecology. This advanced period also may be devoted to an in-depth study of a subspecialty area such as gynecologic oncology, maternal-fetal medicine, reproductive endocrinol\u00ad ogy and infertility, or human sexuality. Ophthalmology. Medical students are instructed in basic techniques of ophthalmologic examination, the principles of ophthalmology, and the common sense evaluation of oph\u00ad thalmic problems. Pediatrics. Pediatrics includes instruction in the management and nutrition of normal and sick infants and children; rela\u00ad tionships with parents and other family members; normal development of the infant into childhood and adolescence; diagnosis of developmental defects; general approaches to treatment and rehabilitation; common infections predomi\u00ad nant in infancy and childhood; and peculiarities of the effects of medication in children. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. During the physical medicine and rehabilitation rotation, students are assigned patients who are in an active rehabilitation program. Empha\u00ad sis is placed on the rehabilitation of the total patient. The medical aspects of the patient's care are discussed in detail. Instruction is provided in the various physical techniques of rehabilitation and in the psychosocial factors which perma\u00ad nently affect this process. Primary Care. Students attend an assigned primary care clinic one-half day per week for five consecutive quintiles in either family medicine, internal medicine, or pediatrics. Each student becomes the primary care provider for a number of patients in an ambulatory setting and continues as their primary care provider throughout the clerkship. Under the supervision of primary care faculty, students gain specific primary care skills. This experience in continuous care should provide a basis for a student's selection or rejection of a career in a primary care specialty. Psychiatry. The eight-week clinical clerkship is the culmina\u00ad tion of the process of learning human behavior as it relates to general medicine. The student elects two four-week clinical rotations as subinternships, participating fully in patient care, clinical teaching, and conferences. Choices include adult inpa\u00ad tient psychiatry, alcoholism, child psychiatry, consultation psychiatry, and emergency room psychiatry. A wide variety of clinical settings and patient populations is available. Radiology. The role of radiological sciences (both diagnostic and therapeutic) in relation to medicine and surgery is taught to students through exposure to clinical specialists in sub\u00ad specialty areas such as nuclear medicine, ultrasound, com\u00ad puterized tomography, chest, bone, gastrointestinal, etc.; daily clinical film conferences with staff and residents; the American College of Radiology film learning laboratory; and daily seminars interrelating general medicine and radiology. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983Emphasis is given to the use of ionizing radiation for diag\u00ad nosis and treatment, understanding the risk/benefit ratios involved, and the clinical indications for various radiological procedures. Surgery. Students study both outpatients (including those in the emergency room) and inpatients. This clerkship empha\u00ad sizes diagnosis, pathophysiology, and general approaches to the treatment of surgical patients, including the special prob\u00ad lems of mass casualties. The student becomes an integral part of the surgical team. Pathology. This is an elective opportunity for the study of anatomical pathology, surgical pathology, clinical laboratory pathology, the subspecialties of pathology, and research in a clinical setting. Interactions among pathology, tumor im\u00ad munology, dermatopathology, cytology, neuropathology, med\u00ad ical jurisprudence, and forensic pathology are demonstrated. MEDICAL RESIDENCY PROGRAMS The following residency programs are offered: Anesthesiology Dermatology Family Medicine Medicine, including Allergy, troenterology, Hematology/Oncology, Infectious Disease, Internal Medicine, Nephrology, Pulmonary Disease, and Rheumatology Neurology Nuclear Medicine Obstetrics and Gynecology Occupational Medicine (Community and Environmental Medicine) Ophthalmology Pathology Pediatrics, including General Pediatrics, Allergy, Genetics and Developmental Disabilities, Ambulatory and Community Pediatrics, Endocrinology, Neonatology, and Hem a to logy /Oncology Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Psychiatry and Human Behavior, including Adult and Child Psychiatry Radiology, including Diagnostic and Therapeutic Radiology S~rgery, including General Surgery, Neurosurgery, Ortho\u00ad pedic Surgery, Plastic Surgery, Thoracic Surgery, Urologic Surgery, and Vascular Surgery All programs meet the formal standards of the American Medical Association and the appropriate specialty boards. The University of California, Irvine adheres to the Health Profes\u00ad sions Educational Assistance Act of 1976, P.L. 94-484, Section 709, regarding shared-schedule residency training positions. GRADUATE ACADEMIC PROGRAMS The basic medical science Departments of Anatomy, Biologi\u00ad cal Chemistry, Microbiology, and Physiology and Biophysics of the College of Medicine participate jointly with the School of Biological Sciences in offering graduate instruction leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Biological Sciences. In addi\u00ad tion, the Department of Radiological Sciences and the De\u00ad partment of Pharmacology offer M.S. and Ph.D. programs. Application materials may be obtained by writing the Divi\u00ad sion of Graduate Studies and Research, University of Cali\u00ad fornia, Irvine; Irvine, California 92 717. A detailed description of the graduate academic programs by department follows. Medicine 253 M.D./Ph.D. PROGRAMS Exceptionally well-qualified students interested in careers in academic medicine may be admitted concurrently to the M.D. program and one of several Ph.D. programs. These students pursue curricula leading to an M.D. degree from the College of Medicine and a Ph.D. degree from the School of Biological Sciences. (Students presently holding either degree are not eligible for the program.) Applicants for this program must submit separate applications to both the College of Medicine and the Division of Graduate Studies and Research and should note on both applications that they wish to be consid\u00ad ered as M.D./Ph.D. candidates. The Division of Graduate Studies and Research application must be for admission to a graduate department with an approved Ph.D. program, and applicants should write the department they wish to join for graduate admission requirements. For additional information, write Dr. James Hall, M.D./Ph.D. Coordinator, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, College of Medicine, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717. Anatomy The Department of Anatomy in the College of Medicine offers a doctoral program leading to the Ph.D. degree in Bio\u00ad logical Sciences, with specialized research training in the neu\u00ad rosciences. Research programs in the neurosciences include neurotransmitter immunocytochemistry, the central neural regulation of circadian rhythms, forebrain organization, and organization and development of sensory systems. Research programs also include growth inhibition, cartilage, and pul\u00ad monary edema. The Department maintains research facilities so that the student can become experienced with the follow\u00ad analysis of neuroscientific data. Students are encouraged to become proficient in multiple areas of study using numerous tech\u00ad niques in various species. Students in the Department of Anatomy have two major goals. The first goal is to attain the technical skills, theoretical background, and experimental knowledge necessary to con\u00ad duct innovative and fundamentally sound research. The second goal is to become knowledgeable anatomists with the ability to teach graduate, undergraduate, and professional courses in anatomy and neuroscience. These two goals are achieved through a basic and extended academic program that is tailored to the individual needs of the student. The core curriculum is designed to provide all students with a fundamental knowledge of gross, cellular, and subcellular anatomy; physiology; and biochemistry. In the first year, stu\u00ad dents will be required to take neuroanatomy, microscopic anatomy, embryology, gross anatomy, biochemistry, and phys\u00ad iology. Over the usual four-year training period the student will be required to complete a practical course in statistics, four departmental seminar courses, four laboratory tutorials, and a total of 50 credit hours of research in anatomy. Elective courses in the Department of Anatomy or other departments on campus may also be taken; examples include pharmacol\u00ad ogy, psychobiology, cell biology, genetics, computer science, pathology, and physiology. The student typically devotes the majority of the first year to taking core courses and about half of the second year to taking electives. Only a minimum of the third year is spent taking courses. Each year following the first year, the student is expected to act as an assistant in one major anatomy core course. When a student is accepted into the graduate program, the student and the Graduate Committee decide to which labora- UC IRVINE - 1982-1983254 Medicine tories the student will be assigned the first year. During the first year the student will spend approximately 25 percent of the time doing research. At the beginning of the second year the student and the Graduate Committee select a faculty sponsor who will supervise the dissertation research. An oral Qualifying Examination at the end of the summer of the second year is given to the student by a Candidacy Commit\u00ad tee. The examination covers anatomy and focuses on the candidate's field of specialization. The dissertation research is chosen by the student and faculty advisor under guidance of the Graduate Committee. The majority of the second, third, and fourth year is devoted to completing the research and preparing a written disserta\u00ad tion suitable for publication. An oral defense of the dissertation research before the stu\u00ad dent's advisor and Doctoral Committee constitutes the final examination. The Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences is awarded following completion of all the requirements, a pro\u00ad cess that normally will take four years to complete. Biological Chemistry The Department of Biological Chemistry in the College of Medicine and the Department of Molecular Biology and Bio\u00ad chemistry in the School of Biological Sciences jointly offer graduate study leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences under the administration of the School of Biological Sciences. The program makes extensive use of health sciences facilities, in addition to those of the School of Biological Sciences. The curriculum is designed to produce creative and productive scientists who have an in-depth comprehension of modern biochemistry and molecular biology and who are highly com\u00ad petent in a given subspecialty. The faculty's research interests include structure and synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins, regulation, metabolism, biochemical genetics, gene organiza\u00ad tion, and immunology. The first-year student is required to take a core of advanced courses (204, 20SA-B, 207, and 280) to become associated with the laboratories of at least three different investigators, and to attend the 201A-B-C seminar series. Upon successful completion of the first year, the stu\u00ad dent is given a comprehensive oral examination to test breadth and depth of knowledge. Although further supple\u00ad mental work may be recommended, the student normally begins a specific research project with a faculty member in the second year. By passing an oral examination at the beginning of the third year on the proposed thesis work, the student may advance to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Stu\u00ad dents normally complete their degree programs after a total of four years of graduate study. Participation in the seminar series (201A-B-C) and completion of at least one satellite course per year (210-279) are expected of all continuing stu\u00ad dents. Regular teaching of undergraduates is part of the training of graduate students at all levels. The graduate committee may waive some of the above requirements for candidates for the Master's degree. Applicants should have adequate undergraduate preparation in calculus, physics, physical chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry. Students who have not had an adequate physical chemistry course are expected to take Chemistry 130A-B-C during their first year. See page 79 for information on faculty research areas and course descriptions. Microbiology Graduate instruction and research in microbiology leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences are offered by the Depart\u00ad ment of Microbiology, College of Medicine. The curriculum of the Department is designed to provide advanced training to individuals interested in the molecular basis of regulatory systems which operate in viruses, microorganisms, and cul\u00ad tured mammalian cells; and in the structure, genetics, and synthesis of immunoglobulins. The core curriculum is cen\u00ad tered about the molecular biology and genetics of viruses and bacteria, the fundamentals of the immune response, the biol\u00ad ogy of cultured animal cells, and the genetics and physiology of infectious agents. It is recommended that the student's undergraduate prepara\u00ad tion include courses in calculus, physical chemistry, biochem\u00ad istry, genetics, and general biology. Before a graduate degree will be awarded, the student must demonstrate competence, by course work and examination, in biochemistry, physical chemistry, genetics, and various aspects of microbiology and immunology. During the first year, all students in the gradu\u00ad ate program will be expected to spend approximately six weeks in various faculty members' laboratories with the aim of becoming familiar with the research approaches and the laboratory techniques employed in each specific research area. Incoming students review their programs each quarter with the departmental graduate student advisor. During the second or third year, each student will take an advancement\u00ad to-candidacy examination. Graduate students are required to take graduate courses in biochemistry, and Microbiology 210, 212, 213, 214, and 280. Since a working knowledge of biolog\u00ad ical systems enhances study at the molecular level, students are encouraged to take additional courses in microbiology, immunology, cell biology, and developmental biology. The major remaining requirement for the Ph.D. degree will be the satisfactory completion and oral defense of a dissertation consisting of original research carried out under the guidance of a faculty member. Students with adequate preparation should be able to complete the Ph.D. in four years or less. See page 84 for information on faculty research areas and course descriptions. Pharmacology and Toxicology Graduate instruction and research in pharmacology leading to the M.S. and Ph.D in Pharmacology and Toxicology is offered by the Department of Pharmacology, College of Med\u00ad icine. The Department is engaged in a broad scope of research activity. Faculty research interests include the mech\u00ad anisms of action and effects of drugs on the nervous system and on behavior, on skeletal muscle, heart and blood vessels, and on basic processes in these tissues. Other areas of inter\u00ad est are the toxicology of environmental substances, especially inhalation toxicology, genetic toxicology, and chemical carcinogenesis. Prerequisites for admission include a background in the phys\u00ad ical and biological sciences which includes courses in mathe\u00ad matics, physics, chemistry, and biochemistry, including labor\u00ad atory experience. The Graduate Record Examination and Advanced Test in Biology or Chemistry are required. Prefer\u00ad ence will be given to outstanding applicants for the doctoral program. The graduate core program includes Pharmacology 241A-B, Pharmacology 248A-B-C, quarterly participation in Pharma\u00ad cology 298, a course in computer science, and any additional elective courses assigned by faculty advisors. The major addi\u00ad tional requirement for the Ph.D. is the satisfactory comple\u00ad tion and oral defense of a dissertation based on original research carried out under the guidance of a faculty member. Before advancing to candidacy each student must pass a writ\u00ad ten qualifying examination to determine the student's compe\u00ad tence in pharmacology or pharmacology and toxicology. The UC IRVINE - 1982-1983full-time student is expected to pass the written qualifying examination by the eighth quarter and the oral qualifying examination for the Ph.D. by the eleventh quarter.

Physiology and Biophysics Graduate instruction and research in physiology and biophys\u00ad ics leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences is offered by the Department of Physiology and Biophysics, College of Medi\u00ad cine. The Department provides research opportunities in the molecular biophysics of membranes and proteins; endocrinol\u00ad ogy; cellular physiology; and the physiology of exercise, res\u00ad piration, and the nervous system. The faculty research is generally oriented toward molecular and cellular physiology, but opportunities for research in organ physiology also exist. The curriculum provides the student with a broad back\u00ad ground in physiology and biophysics and the closely related fields of anatomy and biochemistry. Elective courses permit in-depth exploration of particular areas. Interdisciplinary dis\u00ad sertation research involving the research of more than one faculty member is encouraged. Prerequisites for admission normally include a bachelor's degree in one of the biological sciences, physics, chemistry, mathematics, or engineering, as well as undergraduate courses in calculus, organic and physical chemistry, biochem\u00ad istry, and advanced biology (e.g., neurophysiology, cell biol\u00ad ogy, neurobiology, psychobiology). Up to two prerequisites may be fulfilled as first-year electives. GRE Aptitude Test scores are required. Preference will be given to those stu\u00ad dents who have prior research experience. The Department admits about three highly qualified students each fall. The program emphasizes original research, and stu\u00ad dents are expected to become involved in the research of the Department as early as possible. The core program includes graduate courses in physiology, biophysics, biochemistry; morphology, and cell biology. After the first year, training will follow the classical tutorial pattern in which a small Medicine 255 number of students are tutored by the faculty in an informal setting. Students also will participate in a program of labora\u00ad tory rotations and attend the weekly colloquium in physiol\u00ad ogy. The third and fourth years will be spent primarily in research, with some participation in teaching physiology to medical students. Each student must submit a written disser\u00ad tation on an original research project and successfully defend this dissertation in an oral examination. Incoming students will receive academic advising from the Department Graduate Advisor until such time as they choose a thesis advisor. The faculty conducts quarterly reviews of all continuing students to ensure that they are maintaining satisfactory progress within their particular academic pro\u00ad gram. Students who have completed all necessary prerequi\u00ad sites should be able to complete the Ph.D. within four years. A comprehensive examination will be administered in june at the end of the second year. The examination is based upon the tutorials in advanced physiology and is designed to test the student's ability to organize a body of knowledge and to think critically. Some time during the third year, the student will present a seminar on a topic assigned by the formal can-\u00b7 didacy committee. Following the seminar, the committee will critically examine the student's qualifications for the success\u00ad ful conduct of the doctoral dissertation. Advancement to can\u00ad didacy for the Ph.D. is recommended to the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and Research upon the unanimous vote of the committee. For information on faculty research areas and course descrip\u00ad tions, see page 84. Some faculty from the Department are members of an inter\u00ad disciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group; see page 70 for a description of the program. Radiological Sciences The Department of Radiological Sciences offers graduate programs of advanced study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. Both programs are oriented toward the education and training of the superior student who has the potential and desire to become a creative and productive member of the medical or medical-related communities. A broad-based, interdisciplinary curriculum places heavy emphasis on research and is designed to provide the student with a comprehensive knowledge of the field in addition to an exceptionally high level of competence in one or more subspecialties. By utilizing the training received in medical imaging, medical physics, bioengineering, radiobiology, and radiological engineering, the student should be prepared for a wide range of career opportunities in university, hospital, or industrial settings upon completion of this program. Prospec~ tive students are cautioned that the program is extremely demanding and requires a broad base of knowledge in a vari\u00ad ety of the conventional disciplines. The Department of Radiological Sciences has well-equipped radiodiagnostic, radiobiological, engineering, and medical physics laboratories located on campus and at the hospitals associated with the University of California, Irvine. Major research areas include the ge'neral aspects of medical imaging and basic and applied studies dealing with radiodiagnosis, nuclear medicine, computerized tomography, medical ultra\u00ad sonics, radiotherapy, and radiobiology. The core program plus additional courses as may be required by the Graduate Committee normally will require two years to complete. To receive either the M.S. or Ph.D. degree, the student must successfully complete the core courses or their equivalents. UC IRVINE - 1982-1983256 Medicine Requirements for the M.S. degree may be satisfied in one of two ways. Under Plan I, the student completes the Radiologi\u00ad cal Sciences core program with an average grade of B or above and under the direction of a faculty advisor also pre\u00ad pares a thesis that is acceptable to the thesis committee. Under Plan II, the student completes the core program plus a minimum of eight additional credits (all with an average grade of B or above) in a given area of specialization and satisfactorily passes a comprehensive written examination. Requirements for the Ph.D. degree may be divided into four stages. First, the student must complete the core program and take additional course work as recommended by the Graduate Committee, all with an average grade of B or . above. Second, the student must pass a written and oral qual\u00ad ifying examination given at the end of the second full year of study. A student who fails the preliminary qualifying exami\u00ad nation can, with approval from the Graduate Committee, repeat the examination the following year. Third, within a year after passing the preliminary examination, the student must pass the final oral qualifying examination covering the proposed field of research and be advanced to candidacy. Finally, a dissertation representing original research in the student's principal field of study must be prepared and defended. The dissertation, conducted under the direction of the doctoral committee, represents the major element in the doctoral program; it must be a significant contribution to the field and is expected to demonstrate critical judgment, intel\u00ad lectual synthesis, and creativity. During the final quarter of graduate study the student is required to defend the disserta\u00ad tion in an oral examination conducted by the doctoral committee. Admission to the graduate program is by the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and Research upon recommendation of the Department and is based upon letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, previous scholarship, and other qualifications. Applicants should have a broad undergraduate background in both the physical and the bio\u00ad logical sciences. Since most students will need some addi\u00ad tional work in one or more disciplines, the graduate program allows for the correction of minor deficiencies during the first year, as determined by departmental review. Although the program is rigorous, it is also sufficiently flexible to allow for a wide range of interests and objectives. Application deadline for the fall quarter is June 1 of each year. However, to receive full consideration for financial assistance, fall quarter applications should be completed by February I. Applications for the winter and spring quarters will be accepted only under special circumstances. Graduate Courses in Radiological Sciences 200A-B Principles of Radiation Physics (4-4) F, W.

UC IRVINE - 1982-1983260 University Professors/Student Records UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS Melvin Calvin, University Professor Emeritus University of California, Berkeley Murray Krieger, University Professor University of California, Irvine Josephine Miles, University Professor Emeritus University of California, Berkeley Glenn Seaborg, University Professor University of California, Berkeley Neil Smelser, University Professor University of California, Berkeley Edward Teller, University Professor Emeritus Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Charles Townes, University Professor University of California, Berkeley Sherwood Washburn, University Professor University of California, Berkeley Lynn White, Jr., University Professor Emeritus University of California, Los Angeles STUDENT RECORDS The University of California campuses maintain various types of records pertaining to students; some are maintained for academic purposes; others, such as hospital and employment records, are maintained for other specific purposes. Student records-that is, those pertaining to students in their capacity as students-include but are not limited to academic evaluations, transcripts, test scores and other academic records, general counseling and advising records, disciplinary records, and financial aid records. The disclosure of information from student records is governed in large measure by the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, by the State of California Education Code, and by Uni\u00ad versity policy and procedures implementing these laws which pro\u00ad tect the student's right of privacy, provide safeguards for the con\u00ad fidentiality of student records, and permit students access to their own records. Pursuant to the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the University of California Policies Applying to the Disclosure of Information from Student Records, students at the University have the following five rights: 1. to inspect and review records pertaining to themselves in their capacity as students; 2. to inspect records maintained by the campus of disclosure of per\u00ad sonally identifiable information from their student records; 3. to seek correction of their student records through a request to amend the records or a request for a hearing; 4. to file complaints with the Department of Health and Human Services regarding alleged violations of the rights accorded them by the Act; and 5. to have withheld from disclosure, in the absence of their prior consent for release, personally identifiable information from their student records, with exceptions as noted in the University student records policies. NOTE: There are instances in which information can be disclosed without prior wrillen consent of the stude-nt. University officials may require access to student records in the course of the performance of their assigned duties. Further, (a) in connection with conditions of cer\u00ad tain financial aid awards; (b) when the campus is complying with a judicial order or subpoena; and (c) when authorized federal or Stale officials are conducting an audit or evaluation of federally supported educational programs, confidential information can be disclosed with\u00ad out prior written consent of the student. There are also other situations in which the University is required to disclose information. See Poli\u00ad cies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, Part B, Section 10.7 21 for a list of exceptions. Normally, the campus will release the following as personally iden\u00ad tifiable information which can be made public: Student's name; Address (campus, local, and/or permanent) and telephone numbers; Date and place of birth; Major field of study, dates of attendance, degrees and honors received; Most recent previous educational institution attended; Participation in officially recognized activities, including intercol\u00ad legiate athletics; Name, weight, and height of participants on intercollegiate Univer\u00ad sity athletic teams. However, students have the right to refuse to permit any or all of these categories to be designated public information with respect to themselves. (See the NOTE above.) If a student requests that information from his or her records not be regarded as public information, then the information will not be released to anyone without the written consent of the student. The student should be aware of the important implications of exercising this right. For example, if a request is made to withhold from dis\u00ad closure a student's name and degrees and honors received, the cam\u00ad pus cannot release for publication information on any honors received by the student, such as election to Phi Beta Kappa, and cannot include the student's name and degree earned in the campus commencement program without the written consent of the stu\u00ad dent. Similarly, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student's name and dates of attendance, a student's status as a stu\u00ad dent cannot be verified for potential employers without the written consent of the student. Further, if a student's last instruction to the campus was to withhold from disclosure the degree granted to that student and the date on which the degree was conferred, that information cannot be confirmed for a third party in connection with the appointment of that graduate to a new position or in con\u00ad nection with an honor that individual received without the written consent of the student. Students wishing to restrict release of public information should contact the Registrar's Office for instructions on how to do so. Questions regarding the rights of students under the University policies and the federal law should be directed to the Vice Chancel\u00ad lor Student Affairs or that person's designate, 260 Administration. A Personal Data Sheet is included in each quarter's registration packet which allows students to examine and update their personal data. Furthermore, during the eighth week of classes, every student is provided with a record of current term enrollment as part of his or her registration materials for the next quarter to ensure the accuracy of official enrollment. Students are urged to report offi\u00ad cially to the Registrar's Office all changes in personal data and en\u00ad rollment data. It is extremely important for each student to keep the Registrar's Office currently informed as changes occur to assure that accurate and complete records are maintained. Students are informed annually of their rights under the Univer\u00ad sity's student records policies and the federal Act. Copies of the Act and University and campus policies are available for review in the Reference Room, Main Library. In addition, University policies are published in the booklet Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students-Par/ B, copies of which are available in the Student Activities Office. Complaints regarding alleged violation of the rights accorded stu\u00ad dents by the federal Act may be filed with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Office (FERPA), Department of Education, 4511 Switzer Building, Washington, D.C. 20202.
