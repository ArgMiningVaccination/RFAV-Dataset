How do we recruit staff to ensure the best applicants are chosen to meet the need of the trial? CENSUS AND CLUSTER DEMARCATION A baseline census is done so that at the end of the trial the results can be compared to see what has changed. The census also allows the households to be divided into clusters - the intervention arm and the control arm - based on baseline infection prevalence. Informed consent must be obtained from eligible participants before starting the trial. How do we ensure we have informed consent? [SOP 201 Census informed consent](/content/dam/nhmwww/our-science/our-work/sustainability/deworm3/DeWorm3_SOP_201.%20Census%20informed%20consent%20v2%2020190121.pdf) A baseline census is carried out to quantify the population size of the trial site and to establish a socio-demographic database to create a sampling frame and inform cluster demarcation. How is the census administered in the community? [SOP 202 Administrating the baseline census](/content/dam/nhmwww/our-science/our-work/sustainability/deworm3/DeWorm3_SOP_202.%20Administering%20the%20baseline%20census_072018.pdf) [SOP 203 Administrating the census update](/content/dam/nhmwww/our-science/our-work/sustainability/deworm3/DeWorm3_SOP_203.%20Administering%20census%20updates%20v2.pdf) All schools within the trial boundaries are surveyed to create a cluster school database and assess the presence and status of WASH facilities. How is a school facility survey administered? LONGITUDINAL MONITORING SURVEY As with the baseline census, informed consent must be received from eligible participants. Data from stool samples collected at time points in the longitudinal cohorts will assess rates of change in STH prevalence, quantify reinfection and validate the models. How is the baseline longitudinal monitoring survey administered? [SOP 303 Administering the first longitudinal monitoring survey (incl eligibility and consent)](/content/dam/nhmwww/our-science/our-work/sustainability/deworm3/DeWorm3_SOP_303.%20Administering%20the%20baseline%20longitudinal%20monitoring%20survey%20v2.pdf) What are the procedures for treating individuals in control clusters identified as positive cases (children with any intensity STH infection and adults with moderate to high intensity STH infection)?

The study involves working in-country to identify barriers to research uptake. Systematic participant selection is vital to attain and evaluate a representative set of perspectives, experiences, and opinions. How do we select participants? [SOP 801 Participant selection for individual interviews](/content/dam/nhmwww/our-science/our-work/sustainability/deworm3/DeWorm3_SOP_801.%20Participant%20selection%20for%20individual%20interviews_2017_08_24.pdf) [SOP 802 Participant selection for focus group discussions](/content/dam/nhmwww/our-science/our-work/sustainability/deworm3/DeWorm3_SOP_802.%20Participant%20selection%20for%20focus%20group%20discussions_2017_08_24.pdf) [SOP 807 Participant selection for structural readiness survey](/content/dam/nhmwww/our-science/our-work/sustainability/deworm3/DeWorm3_SOP_807.%20Participant%20selection%20for%20structural%20readiness%20survey_2017_10_12.pdf) Informed consent must be obtained from eligible participants before starting the trial.

How to we survey the 'readiness' of stakeholders? [SOP 808 Conducting structural readiness surveys](/content/dam/nhmwww/our-science/our-work/sustainability/deworm3/DeWorm3_SOP_808.%20Conducting%20structural%20readiness%20surveys_2017_08_24.pdf) In order to better understand the way in which MDA is delivered in each cluster, process mapping takes place in all clusters following each round of MDA. In-depth process mapping is undertaken in six of these clusters. How do we choose the six clusters in which do conduct in-depth process mapping? [SOP 809 Cluster selection for indepth process mapping](/content/dam/nhmwww/our-science/our-work/sustainability/deworm3/DeWorm3_SOP_809.%20Cluster%20selection%20for%20indepth%20process%20mapping_2017_08_24.pdf) Once the clusters are chosen for in-depth process mapping, activities are carried out in conjunction with relevant Ministries.
