Abstract We present a case of elective total knee arthroplasty where the surgical procedure was affected by the neuromuscular blocking agent administered at induction of general anaesthesia. Recognition of this effect was vital to avoid additional bone resection at the soft tissue balancing stage of the procedure. Keywords: To tal knee arthroplasty balancing; Neuromuscular; Hypertension Case Report A 59 year old male with a medical history of hypertension, non- insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, angina and benign prostatic hyperplasia whom underwent simultaneous bilateral primary total knee arthroplasty surgery for osteoarthritis (Figure 1). The patient re ceived Atracurium 50 mg IV at the induction of general anaesthesia for muscle relaxant purposes. Figure 1: Patient's left knee radiographs pre and immediately post op eration Surgery on the first side was uneventful, with soft tissues balanced usin g conventional techniques. Surgery to the second knee commenced upon closure of the first knee. Soft tissue balancing of the left knee initially seemed uneventful. A 10 mm trial spacer was used fo r flexion and extension gap balancing and movements were normal. Dur ing preparation of the tibia, it was then noticed that the trial components became increasingly difficult to remove, and after removal bo th flexion and extension gaps had decreased significantly. At 1 hour and fifteen minutes post induction the knee gap had decreased suchthat it was not possible to remove the trial polyethylene spacer from th e knee, the stage of the procedure was subsequently delayed. Figure 2: The anaesthetic chart used during the case presented. A fur ther dose of atracurium is documented as given at 1345, 1 hour and fifteen minutes after induction of anaesthesia A further 25 mg IV bolus of Atracurium (Figure 2) was then given. This enabled sufficient relaxation to enable soft tissue balancing to con tinue without difficulty. A 10 mm trial spacer was then used to ch eck the gap and was put into the knee without problems encountered beforehand. The operation was finished as planned with a cemented to tal knee replacement and 10 mm polyethylene spacer (Figure 1). EUA post wound closure, and clinical evaluation at clinic follow up revealed good collateral stability both in flexion and extension.Lee and Holt, J Arthritis 2016, 5:3 DOI: 10.4172/2167-7921.1000202 Case Report Open Access J Arthritis ISSN: 2167-7921 JAHS, an open access journalVolume 5 Issue 3 1000202Journal of ArthritisJournal of Arthritis ISSN: 2167-7921Discussion Soft tissue management has a major influence on outcome in p rimary total knee replacement [1]. It is therefore essential that possible sources for error in soft tissue balancing are eliminated. We r eport one such source of error, associated with the use of muscle relaxant during anaesthesia. At induction of anaesthesia, patients commonly receive a dose of neuromuscular blocking drugs such as Atracurium, when having an endotracheal tube placed for the general anaesthetic [2,3]. Neuromuscular blocking drugs such as atracurium block the transmission through the neuromuscular junction at nicotinic receptors and thus reduce skeletal muscle tone [2]. Non-depolarising agents bind to receptors and prevent acetylcholine from stimulating receptors. Their effect is to compete with acetylcholine for nicotinic r eceptors. Their blockade is competitive and therefore gradual in onset [2]. N euromuscular blocking drugs administered to patients during the induction of anaesthesia prior to arthroplasty surgery are detailed in Table 1. A difference in their duration of action times is noted between 5 an d 40 minutes depending on the dose given [2-6]. Muscle relaxant Dose (mg/kg) muscle relaxants [4,6-8] Atracurium is a non-depolarising muscle relaxant. It is a short- acting relaxant, which is rapidly broken down by the body. This makes at racurium very predictable, as it wears off rapidly compared with the lo nger-acting relaxants. A dose of 0.3-0.6 mg/kg will provide relaxation for 20-40 minutes [3]. Depending on the nature of the surgery and the physique of the patient, the return of muscle tone during surgery could have an effect on soft tissue tension [3,7]. Therefore, the return of m uscle tone could theoretically affect the flexion and extension gap d uring total knee replacement. When considered in terms of timing during primary total arthroplasty, and in particular simultaneous bilateral primary total arthroplasty or complex primary total arthroplasty of the knee, the upper limits of the duration of action are likely to coincide with the soft tissue balancing of the knee.As the effect of the muscle relaxants administered diminishes, co ntraction of the knee may occur and significantly impede the soft tissue balancing stage of the operation, in particular when balancing t he flexion and extension gaps. If this is not recognized it may lead to an unnecessary recut of the femur or tibia. These may then create an un even soft tissue envelope around the implanted arthroplasty co mponents and alter the long term outcome of the primary arthroplasty procedure [1,8]. Conclusion The diminishing action of neuromuscular blockade may cause co ntraction of the knee during arthroplasty, which if unrecognised can lead to inappropriate bone resection. This should be understood by b oth the surgeon and anaesthetist. We suggest surgical teams should be aware of the use of neuromuscular blocking agents administered during primary knee arthroplasty operations and the timings of their duration of action as this may coincide with crucial stages of the operation. Likewise, anaesthetic teams should appreciate the importance of the soft tissue balancing in the outcome of primary total arthroplasty and s hould be prepared to adjust the timings or give further doses of neuromuscular blocking agents accordingly.
