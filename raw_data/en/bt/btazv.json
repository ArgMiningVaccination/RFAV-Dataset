In the summer of 2023 in Glenmoore, Pennsylvania, the AHA will hold a conference to find renewal on this path with one another. You are invited to come to the Kimberton area in Glenmoore, PA to join us in celebrating this 100 Year anniversary! The three keynote speakers will be collaborating through the \"Mysteries of Healing\" evening lectures, practical teaching lectures, and interdisciplinary case presentations. Each presenter will bring a case for the interdisciplinary case groups for open discussion and sharing of insights. The case discussions will be followed by mid-day talks to develop practical therapeutic imaginations. These topics will be illuminated through singing, therapeutic artistic activities, and an interactive workshop titled \"AnthropoSophia: Connecting Social and Individual Health,\" led by Raphael Knauf MD and Jan Goeschel, PhD. The goal of this workshop is to strengthen our ideal intentions of working with solidarity, freedom, and equality in medicine and therapies. Join us in collaborating together for this most special AHA biennial conference in celebration of AnthropoSophia! Please register for the Pre-Conference and the Main Conference separately.
