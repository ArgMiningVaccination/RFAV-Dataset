WHAT IS BREATHWORK? The breath is your most powerful tool to keep you grounded and connected in your physical body as you navigate through the shifts, challenges and changes of life. Breathwork is a loving and powerful process of self-healing. When we consciously connect the breath, we get to feel into deeper parts of ourselves. Revealing what lays in our unconscious to our consciousness. Through breathwork, old patterns can be revealed and broken to make room for new habits, relationships, and abundance. Conscious breathing has the potential to transform the quality of your life on every level. WHAT IS A CACAO ACTIVATION? Cacao has been used for centuries as a \"plant medicine\" due to its heart opening qualities and wide-ranging health benefits, and when grown and consumed consciously, carries a vibrational quality that opens us up to a higher level of healing. Cacao ceremonies bring us together to share an intention, and by consuming ceremonial grade cacao, we can activate and allow a deeper state of being. Cacao is used to gently touch your heart and to guide you into an inner journey deep into the emotional center of our body - our heart (Anahata) chakra. I will be sharing pure ceremonial grade Cacao from Peru which contains many bioactive compounds including theobromine \"drink of the gods\" and theophylline of the gods\".
