Its main features include relative insulin deficiency, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia[1]. Over the past few years, tre- mendous progress has been made in elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in the origin and development of insu- lin resistance, although many gaps still remain to be filled. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle where pro- tein folding, post-translational modification and oligomeriza-tion take place. This reticulum system senses alterations of intracellular homeostasis provoked by stimuli, subsequently inducing an unfolded protein response (UPR) [2]. The UPR decreases protein translation, increases chaperone expression and accelerates the degradation of misfolded proteins via three main signal transducers to alleviate cellular stress and restore ER homeostasis. These transducers include inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE-1), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), and activat- ing transcription factor 6 (ATF6). When ER stress fails to be attenuated, apoptosis will be activated and cells are subjected to chronic stimulation [2]. Recently, there has been a special interest in ER stress because of its central role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabe-tes, and valuable results have been discovered [3-6]. For exam- ple, it was found that molecular indicators of ER stress, such as PERK, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) and glucose- regulated protein 78 (GRP78), increased in liver and adipose tissues of dietary and genetic murine obesity models. In addition, administration of tunicamycin, an ER stress inducer, results in suppression of insulin receptor signaling (insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) tyrosine and AKT serine phos -Activating transcription factor 6 protects insulin receptor from ER stress-stimulated desensitization via p42/44 ERK pathway Xuan Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China; 2Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Shanghai 200011, China; 3Department of Chemistry and Center for Innovation in Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Prince of Songkla University, Thailand Aim: Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) is a key signal transducer of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). This study was con - ducted to clarify the potential role of ATF6 in the insulin signaling pathway under chronic ER stress. Methods: ER stress of HEK293 cells was induced with tunicamycin (2 \u00b5g/mL). The cells were transfected with ATF6 or ATF6. The phosphorylation level of insulin receptor (IR) was analyzed using Western blot. The changes in ER stress and ERK signaling pathways were explored using Western blot and quantitative real-time Tunicamycin-induced IR from ATF6 modulation of IR insulin-stimulated extra - cellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. The treatment of the cells with a specific ERK inhibitor U0126 (10 \u00b5mol/L) mimicked the effect of ATF6 over-expression and restored the insulin-stimulated IR phosphorylation. The treatment of the cells with the ERK activator epidermal growth factor (EGF, 200 ng/mL) decreased the protection effect of ATF6 on IR. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that ATF6 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

ER stress was also discovered to repress the insulin signaling pathway through activation of the IRE-1 and another important ER stress signal transducer, down-regulates JNK activity, enhances insulin receptor signaling pathway activ-ity and restores glucose homeostasis [3]. The attenuation of (PBA) protein 150 kDa (Orp150) over-expression has been confirmed effective in increasing insulin sensitivity and ameliorating diabetes in vivo [4-6]. Although targeting ER stress has been hinted at as a promising therapeutic strategy for anti-diabetic agent discovery, further investigations should remain in consideration of the complexity of the ER stress net-work. Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) is a 90-kDa ER- anchoring protein with cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. The cytoplasmic domain contains a transcriptional activation domain (TAD) and a b-ZIP DNA binding motif [9, 10]. Two isoforms of ATF6 have been determined to date, ATF6 and ATF6. Although the N-terminals of these two isoforms share conserved b-ZIP domains, ATF6 and ATF6 differ greatly in their transcriptional abilities. This is because of their dissimilar transcriptional activation domains [11], which leads to different functions on target genes[12, 13]. When unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER by chemical stimulation or in physiopathological conditions [14, 15], ATF6 is released from the ER lumen by sequential cleavage of Site 1 (S1P) and Site 2 pro-teases (S2P) [9]. This produces a 50-kDa fragment that moves to the nucleus to activate chaperone genes, such as GRP78, GRP94 and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), thus ameliorat- ing ER stress [16]. Regarding the potent involvement of ER stress in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes[17-19] and the determined func- tion of ATF6 in the management of cell homeostasis[15, 16], we attempted to clarify the potential role of ATF6 in the insulin signaling pathway. We discovered that both ATF6 and ATF6 attenuate tunicamycin stimulated IR desensitization through an ERK-related pathway. It is expected that members of the ATF6 family could be potential therapeutic targets for anti-obesity and type 2 diabetes drug discovery.

After overnight culture, the cells were treated with tunicamycin (0, 2, 5, and 10 g/mL) for 12 h. MTT stock solution was added at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. Cells were then cultured for another 4 h. The resulting forma- zan crystals were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, 200 \u00b5L) for 10 min. Absorbance was then recorded at 490 nm on a microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad, USA). The effect of tunicamycin on cell viability was assessed as percentage of cell viability compared to DMSO-treated control cells, which were arbitrarily assigned as 100% viable. Statistical analysis All data are shown as mean\u00b1standard deviation (SD).

Results Excessive ER stress desensitized insulin receptor signaling As reported, the ER stress inducer tunicamycin significantly inhibited insulin signal transduction by suppression of insulin- induced IRS-1 and AKT phosphorylation in Fao liver cells[3]. Here we examined the potential effects of tunicamycin on the insulin receptor in the HEK293 cell line. This cell line is often used as a model cell line in preliminary investigations related to ER stress, MAPK and insulin signaling path ways [20, 21]. Compared with the DMSO-treated group, activi- ties (Figure 1A). In addition, we also observed that the total amount of IR decreased after long-term tunicamycin treat-ment. These results indicate that short-term stimulation with tunicamycin could activate IR signaling, whereas excessive ER stress will desensitize this signaling in HEK293 cells. ATF6 protected the insulin pathway from ER stress-induced desensitization ATF6 optimized long-term ER stress and protected cells from damage through regulating a number of genes responsible for protein folding and degradation [22-24]. Bearing that in mind, we thus investigated whether members of the ATF6 family could protect IR activity from excessive ER stress. For this assay, after transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1-ATF6/ATF6, HEK293 cells were treated with tunicamycin for 4-12 h. The over-expression efficiency is shown in panels B and D of Figure 1. As shown in panels C and E of Figure 1, IR phosphorylation was highly responsive to insulin stimu- lation from 8 h in ATF6-transfected cells and from 12 h in ATF6-transfected cells. To further confirm that ATF6/ATF6 protection of IR phosphorylation in response to insulin induction only appeared under ER stress stimula- tion, IR phosphorylation in ATF6/ATF6 overexpressing cells without tunicamycin treatment were examined at 4, 8, and 12 h. As shown in Figure 1F, ATF6/ATF6 overexpres-sion failed to alter IR phosphorylation without tunicamycin treatment. Moreover, tunicamycin markedly decreased the total IR, while over expression of ATF6 (or ATF6) failed to prohibit IR degradation (Figure 1C and 1E). To further verify this result, an ATF6 (or ATF6) stable cell line with EYFP-C1 as a control was constructed and phosphorylation of IR was examined. The over-expression efficiency is shown in Figure 1G and 1I. As indicated in Figure 1H and 1J, obvious increase of IR phosphorylation induced by insulin was shown from 8-h tunicamycin stimulation in the ATF6 stable cell line and from 4-h tunicamycin supplementation in the ATF6 stable cell line. Compared with the transiently transfected cells, the protection of IR phosphorylation from degradation appeared at an earlier time in the ATF6 stable cell lines. This might be caused by a more efficient response to tunicamycin stimulation in stable cell lines with persistent ATF6 expression. Therefore, all of our results suggest that the ATF6 family could protect IR activity from long-term ER stress stimulation, while such an effect may not be associated with the regulation of total IR protein level. ATF6 protection against insulin resistance did not merely link with its function in ER stress ATF6 is one of the three main transducers in UPR that up- regulate a series of genes to relieve the overload of unfolded protein in the ER, thus ameliorating long-term ER stress dam- age [24-27]. Here, expression of three ATF6 target genes (GRP78, GRP94 and PDI) was examined in tunicamycin stimulated HEK293 stable cell lines. The results in Figure 2A-2D and Figure S1 indicate that the stable over-expressing ATF6 (or ATF6) cells respond to tunicamycin stimulation potently as reflected by the increased expression levels of these genes as early as 4 h after stimulation. Additionally, we also examined whether the PERK-eIF2 and IRE1-XBP-1 pathways could be modulated by ATF6 2A and 2B, the PERK-phosphorylated eIF2 phosphorylation did not differ in the stable cells with ATF6 or ATF6 over-expres-Table 1.

Therefore, we propose that ATF6 function in the insulin pathway might be associated with resis - tance to ER stress. Considering that the cell death induced by ER stress could act as an assessment to evaluate sensitivity to ER stress[29], we applied an MTT assay in stable ATF6 (or ATF6) over-expressing cells. The results indicate that ATF6 over-expressing cells failed to counteract tunicamycin-induced cell death in HEK293 cells within 12 h (Figure 2F). Therefore, all of the above-mentioned results suggest that the regulation of the ATF6 family on IR activity might not solely depend on its modulation of UPR. ATF6 failed to attenuate tunicamycin-induced JNK pathway activation As reported, the JNK pathway plays a central role in connect - ing ER stress with type 2 diabetes. Upon activation by ER stress through IRE1[30], JNK can directly phosphorylate IRS-1 at reduction of insulin-induced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and a decrease in activity of the insulin pathway[31, 32]. Given that ATF6 might protect the insu- lin pathway by attenuating JNK pathway activity, the related Figure 2. ATF6 regulation on IR was not solely dependent on its protective role in ER stress. (A and B) HEK293 (EYFP-C1), HEK293 (EYFP-C1-ATF6), and HEK293 (EYFP-C1-ATF6) were cultured with the indicated time before harvest. The ATF6-50 form of plates and stimulated with tunicamycin (2 \u00b5g/mL) for the indicated time before harvest. Total RNA extraction and mRNA quantification of GRP94 (C), PDI (D), and ERdj4 (E) were performed as described in \"Materials and methods\". MTT assays were performed. The results in Figure 3A indicate that stimulation with tunicamycin for 4-8 h strongly elevated JNK phosphorylation, while ATF6 could not reverse such eleva - tion. These results suggest that ATF6 might not participate in the regulation of JNK signaling. ATF6 protection on IR phosphorylation from excessive tuni- camycin stimulation is not connected with the p38 pathway Besides the JNK pathway, the MKK3/6-p38 and MEK1/2- ERK pathways are also associated with several key proteins within the insulin receptor signaling pathway ( eg, IR, IRS, and AKT)[33-37]. We thereby hypothesized that the ERK or p38 path - ways might be involved in ATF6's protection on insulin sig - naling from excessive ER stress stimulation. To evaluate this hypothesis, basal and insulin-stimulated p38 phosphorylation were tested in cells with 4-12 h incubation with tunicamycin. obvious increase in p38 phosphorylation was observed in ATF6-transfected cells treated with tunicamycin. There were no apparent differences in p38 activity found between control and ATF6 transfected cells with insulin stimulation (Figures 3B and 3C). In addition, SB203580 (specific p38 inhibitor) did not alter the phospho - rylation of IR with long-term tunicamycin treatment -(Figure 3D). These results indicate that the p38 signaling pathway might not contribute to the protective effects of ATF6. Similar results were also obtained by over-expressing ATF6 (data not shown). ATF6 regulation against insulin receptor signaling is associated with the ERK pathway To further explore the potential signaling pathway for ATF6 regulation of the insulin receptor, basal and insulin-stimulated ERK phosphorylation were tested in control or ATF6 trans - fected HEK293 cells incubated with tunicamycin for 0-24 h.

(D) After transfection, HEK293 cells were treated with tuni - camycin (2 \u00b5g/mL) together with SB203580 (5 \u00b5mol/L) for the indicated time and insulin (167 nmol/L) for 5 min. Then, the phosphorylated IR was analyzed. cP<0.01. 1144www.nature.com/aps Tang X et al Pharmacologica Sinicanpg The results indicate that insulin-stimulated ERK phosphory - lation was significantly attenuated in cells exposed to tuni - camycin at 12 h (Figure 4A), while its sensitivity in ATF6- overexpressing cells maintained stability except with 24 h tunicamycin incubation (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the basal level of ERK phosphorylation was largely inhibited in ATF6- overexpressing cells as compared with control cells (Figure 4C), whereas ATF6 was able to enhance the level of insulin- induced ERK phosphorylation (Figure 4D) with tunicamycin treatment. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that ATF6 modulates ERK activity induced by tunicamycin stimulation. To further confirm the role of ERK in ATF6 effects on IR, the IR activity was then evaluated in control and ATF6 transient transfected cells with or without U0126 (specific ERK inhibi - tor) treatment. As shown in Figure 5A, IR phosphorylation was greatly dampened by long-term tunicamycin incubation in control but not in ATF6 transient transfected cells. As expected, U0126 treatment almost completely inhibited ERK activity and restored the insulin-stimulated IR phosphoryla - tion in control cells. On the contrary, epidermal growth factor (EGF, ERK activator) treatment together with tunicamycin stimulation largely decreased the protective effects of ATF6 on IR (Figure 5B). However, the results shown in Figure 5C are without tunicamycin treatment and suggest that the above ERK-associated hypothesis was tenable under the instance of tunicamycin stimulation. Similar results were also obtained by over-expressing ATF6 (data not shown). Accordingly, our results imply that ATF6 protects IR activity through attenua - tion of basal ERK activity (at 4-12 h) that is subject to excessive ER stress stimulation. Discussion In recent years, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the ER may serve as an \"interpreter\" by sensing a num - ber of exogenous or endogenous stimuli such as inflamma - tory cytokines[38, 39], abnormal energy fluxes[15] and oxidative stimuli[40]. The ER is a complicated and systemic network, and excessive ER stress may result in insulin resistance[3, 41, 42] and islet -cell dysfunction[43]. Currently, increasing chaperones has been reported to help improve insulin resistance[6]. Here we focused on ATF6 for its potent service as a critical signal transducer in the ER stress system. ATF6 is responsible for up-regulating main chaperone systems[27] and plays a pivotal role in XBP-1 generation[44], which is essential to normal insu- lin signaling pathway functioning and glucose homeostasis[3]. In addition, the genetic report has even identified ATF6 as a Figure 4. ATF6 could modulate ERK activity induced by tunicamycin simulation. (A and B) HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1 (A)/pcDNA3.1-hATF6 (B).

As previously published[43, 46], short-term (from 0 to 4 h) ER stress stimulation could increase AKT activity, while long-term (from 8 to 12 h) stimulation could suppress AKT activity. This reflects the dual character of ER stress: the adaptive/moderate level stress (featured by increased chap - erone proteins and decreased misfolded proteins) and the destructive/excessive level stress (featured by activating JNK, apoptosis signal-regulating 3, 30, 47]. We found that tyrosine-phosphorylated IR was first elevated and then decreased when stimulated with tunicamycin, while total IR decreased after tunicamycin incubation (Figure 1A) based on the results of p-IR/GAPDH ratio quantification instead of the p-IR/t-IR ratio because t-IR was too weak to quantify in 12 h. IR is an important upstream regulator of AKT and its change may partly account for the variation of AKT activity. We discovered that the ATF6 family could protect IR activity from tunicamycin stimulation. To further investigate whether ATF6 protection on IR could affect its downstream molecules, phosphorylation of AKT was examined. As shown in Figure S2, ATF6 also protects AKT from phosphorylation degrada - tion induced by tunicamycin. The contribution of ER stress transducer and related genes were evaluated in HEK293 cell lines to investigate the mecha -nism of ATF6 protection on the insulin pathway. Although the phosphorylation of IRE1 and cleavage of ATF6 could be modulated in ATF6 over-expressing cells, we failed to find any differences between ATF6 over-expression and control cells in the MTT assay. These results suggest that ATF6 over- expression does not improve cell sensitivity to ER stress and regulation of the ATF6 family on IR activity might not be dependent on its protective roles in ER stress. Recently, more new target genes of the ATF6 family have been discovered, including ER-stress related genes regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2)[48]]. It is reported that 250 genes could be up-regulated by tunicamycin treatment and at least 45 were ATF6-dependent, although most of these genes have not yet been fully investigated[23]. The MAPK signaling pathways MKK4/7-SAPK/JNK, MKK3/6-p38, and MEK1/2-ERK have been reported to play key roles in insulin resistance induced by excessive ER stress[33-38]. Therefore, the phosphorylation of JNK, p38 and ERK were examined in ATF6 over-expressing cells. Our results indicate that the MEK1/2-ERK pathway is associated with the ATF6 protection mechanism. Before our investiga - tion, several studies reported that MEK exerted negative effects on the insulin signaling pathway via down-regulation Figure 5. ATF6 regulation of IR signaling pathway activity is associated with ERK pathway. (A and B) After transfection, HEK293 cells were treated with tunicamycin (2 \u00b5g/mL) together with U0126 (10 \u00b5mol/L) (A) or EGF (200 ng/mL) (B) for the indicated time and insulin for 5 min (167 nmol/L).

Several diabetes-inducing agents have also been demonstrated as causing insulin resistance in a MEK-dependent manner [35, 20]. ER stress was also reported to induce activation of ERK[46], and ATF6 was shown to counteract the effects of ER stress[23, 24]. Based on this prior evidence and our results (Figures 4 and 5), it could be concluded that excessive ER stress could increase the basal, but decrease the insulin-induced, activity of ERK. We thus propose the potential effects of ATF6 to be as fol - lows. Long-time ER stress stimulation could induce a constant \"basal\" activation of the ERK pathway, which might have a negative feedback causing the desensitization of IR activity. ATF6 could counteract this negative process through down- regulation of the basal ERK activity and up-regulation of insu- lin-induced ERK activity until 12 h, leading to the restoration of insulin signaling pathway activity. Although our results also showed that ATF6 could enhance p38 activity, it seems that p38 is not involved in ATF6 modulation of IR phosphory- lation (Figure 3). This is consistent with the finding that p38 stimulates insulin-induced glucose uptake through GLUT4 activation transporter translocation [36, 37]. As ATF6 family members exhibit different influ- ences on GRP78 transcription with a hypothetical mechanism that ATF6, as a strong but labile transcription factor, and ATF6, as a weak but stable transcription factor, work collab- oratively to address different ER stress signals [11, 12]. However, we found that ATF6 and ATF6 demonstrated almost the same effects on IR activity. Thus, we hypothesized that no matter what characteristics they possess, these two isotypes might have similar influences on ER quality and cellular phys- iology in the process of adaptation to long-time stress since chronic stimulation would fully induce their activities. Contrary to the opinion that the ATF6 family contributes to alleviating cellular stress [9, 16, 24], the studies by Seo et al sug- gest that ATF6 plays an important role in the development of -cell dysfunction[49]. Although ATF6 was shown to suppress insulin gene expression in INS-1 cells, this process might be a feedback to prevent hyperinsulinmia in vivo. In addition, this report also indicated that ATF6 expression was increased in the pancreatic islets of diabetic rats compared with non- diabetic counterparts. However, this study did not confirm that the increase in ATF6 expression might cause or aggregate diabetes. Based on our current work, we suggest that ATF6 family members could be up-regulated in response to cellular stress to counteract the diabetic stress. Recently, more studies have suggested that the signaling pathway involved in ER stress could be used as a potential target for anti-type 2 diabetes drug design [4-6, 38, 39]. Here we discovered that ATF6 family members protect the insulin receptor pathway from long-term tunicamycin treatment (4-12 h) that mimics the effects of chronic ER stress, implying that ATF6 could be a potential target for increasing insulin sensi- tivity. However, further investigations need to be carried out to clarify the underlying mechanism by which ATF6 regulates ERK activity and other diabetes-related pathways.
