About Ulcerative Colitis Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, immune-mediated inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of the large intestine that causes continuous mucosal inflammation extending, to a variable extent, from the rectum to the more proximal colon.3,4 The hallmark signs and symptoms of ulcerative colitis include rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, tenesmus (a sense of pressure), urgency and fecal incontinence.3,4 The disease course of ulcerative colitis varies between patients and can range from quiescent disease to chronic refractory disease, which in some cases can lead to surgery or life-threatening complications.5,6 The severity of symptoms and unpredictability of disease course can lead to substantial burden and often disability among those living with the disease.7 About INSPIRE Induction Study1 INSPIRE is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of risankizumab 1200 mg IV administered every four weeks as induction therapy in subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. The primary endpoint is clinical remission (per adapted Mayo Score, defined as SFS 1 and not greater than baseline, RBS of 0 and endoscopic subscore 1 without friability) at week 12. Key secondary endpoints include clinical response (decrease from baseline in the Adapted Mayo score 2 points and 30% from baseline, plus a decrease in RBS 1 or an absolute RBS 1), endoscopic improvement (endoscopic subscore 1 without friability), and HEMI of 0 or 1 without friability and Geboes score 3.1) at week 12. Topline results of the study were shared in [March 2023](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3952187-1&h=2939737921&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.abbvie.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-releases%2Frisankizumab-skyrizi-achieves-primary-and-all-secondary-endpoints-in-phase-3-induction-study-in-patients-with-ulcerative-colitis.htm&a=March+2023). More information can be found on [www.clinicaltrials.gov](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) (NCT03398148). About COMMAND Maintenance Study2 The COMMAND study is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled, 52-week maintenance study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab 180 mg or 360 mg SC in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. This study had a re-randomized withdrawal design in which all patients received risankizumab IV induction and those who responded to risankizumab were re-randomized to receive risankizumab 180 mg or 360 mg SC or withdrawal from risankizumab treatment (induction-only control group). For those randomized to the withdrawal from risankizumab treatment (induction-only control group), the rest of the study duration was a risankizumab washout. The objective of the Phase 3 study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab 180 mg or 360 mg as maintenance therapy versus withdrawal from risankizumab treatment (control) in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who responded to risankizumab IV induction in the INSPIRE study. The primary endpoint is clinical remission (per Adapted Mayo Score, defined as SFS 1 and not greater than baseline, RBS of 0 and endoscopic subscore 1 without evidence of friability) at week 52. Key secondary endpoints include endoscopic improvement subscore 1 without evidence of HEMI subscore of 1 without evidence of friability and Geboes score 3.1), and steroid-free clinical remission (defined as clinical remission per Adapted Mayo Score at week 52 and corticosteroid free for 90 days prior to week 52) at week 52. Topline results from this study were shared in [June 2023](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3952187-1&h=3769932459&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.abbvie.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-releases%2Frisankizumab-skyrizi-met-primary-and-key-secondary-endpoints-in-52-week-phase-3-maintenance-study-in-ulcerative-colitis-patients.htm&a=June+2023).
