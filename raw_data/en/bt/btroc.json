HRSA is charged with ensuring access to quality health care through a network of community-based health centers, maternal and child health pro-grams, and community HIV/AIDS programs throughout the States and U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, HRSA's mission includes supporting individuals pursuing careers in medicine, nurs-ing, and many other health disciplines. HRSA fulfills these responsibilities by collecting and analyzing timely, topical information that iden-tifies health priorities and trends that can be addressed through program interventions and capacity building. HRSA is pleased to present Women's Health USA 2009, the eighth edition of the Women's Health USA data book. To reflect the ever-changing, increasingly diverse population and its characteristics, Women's Health USA selectively highlights emerging issues and trends in wom-en's health. Data and information on women veterans, bleeding disorders, hearing problems, and severe headaches and migraines are a few of the new topics included in this edition. There is also a new section providing State-specific data on leading causes of death, overweight and WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 PREFACE 5 obesity, and smoking among women. A special supplement on women's health along the U.S. - Mexico border is also new this year and covers a range of topics including population character-istics, health insurance coverage, and reproduc-tive health. Racial and ethnic, sex, and socioeconomic disparities are highlighted throughout the doc-ument where possible. Where race and ethnic-ity data are reported, every effort was made to ensure that groups are mutually exclusive. In some instances, it was not possible to provide data for all races due to the design of the original data source or the size of the sample population; therefore, data with a relative standard error of 30 percent or greater were considered unreliable and were not reported. For estimates relying on the 2005 -2006 National Health and Nutri- tion Examination Survey, data presented for the Hispanic population should be interpreted with caution. Due to the sampling design of the sur-vey, the data may not be representative of the entire U.S. Hispanic population. The data book was developed by HRSA to provide readers with an easy-to-use collection of current and historical data on some of the most pressing health challenges facing women, their families, and their communities. Women's Health USA 2009 is intended to be a concise reference for policymakers and program managers at the Federal, State, and local levels to identify and clarify issues affecting the health of women. In these pages, readers will find a profile of women's health from a variety of data sources. The data book brings together the latest available infor-mation from various agencies within the Federal government, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Labor, and U.S. Department of Justice. Non-Federal data sources were used when no Federal source was available. Every attempt has been made to use data collected in the past 5 years. It is important to note that the data included are generally not age-adjusted to the 2000 population standard of the United States. This affects the compara-bility of data from year to year, and the interpre-tation of differences across various groups, es-pecially those of different races and ethnicities. Without age adjustment, it is difficult to know how much of the difference in incidence rates between groups can be attributed to differences in the groups' age distributions. Women's Health USA 2009 is available online through the HRSA Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB), Office of Women's Health Web site at http://hrsa.gov/womenshealth or the MCHB Office of Data and Program Devel-opment's Web site at www.mchb.hrsa.gov/data. Some of the topics covered in Women's Health USA 2008 were not included in this year's edi-tion because either new data were not available or because preference was given to an emerging issue in women's health. For coverage of these issues, please refer to Women's Health USA 2008, also available online. The National Women's Health Information Center, located online at www.womenshealth.gov, has detailed women's and minority health data and maps. These data are available through Quick Health Data Online at www.4woman.gov/quickhealthdata. Data are available at the State and county levels, by age, race and ethnicity, and sex.

In most age groups, women accounted for approximately half of the population, with the exception of people aged 65 years and older; within this age group, women represented 58 percent of the population. The growing diver-sity of the U.S. population is reflected in the ra-cial and ethnic distribution of women across age groups. Black and Hispanic women accounted for 8.9 and 6.5 percent of the female population aged 65 years and older, respectively, but they represented 14.6 and 21.5 percent of females under 15 years of age. Non-Hispanic Whites accounted for 80.2 percent of women aged 65 years and older, but only 55.9 percent of those under 15 years of age. America's growing diversity underscores the importance of examining and addressing ra-cial and ethnic disparities in health status and the use of health care services. In 2007, 62.1 percent of non-Hispanic White women report-ed themselves to be in excellent or very good health, compared to only 53.1 percent of His-panic women and 51.0 percent of non-Hispanic Black women. Minority women are dispro-portionately affected by a number of diseases and health conditions, including HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, diabetes, and asthma. For instance, in 2006, HIV incidence was highest among Black (55.7 per 100,000 fe-males) and Hispanic females (14.4 per 100,000 females). One-third of non-Hispanic White women had ever been tested for HIV, compared to 55.5 percent of non-Hispanic Black women and 48.8 percent of Hispanic women. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, was also more prevalent among non-Hispanic Black women than women of other races. In 2005 -2006, this condition occurred at a rate of 199.2 per 1,000 non-Hispanic Black women, WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 INTRODUCTION 7 compared with 163.0 per 1,000 non-Hispanic White women and 117.0 per 1,000 Hispanic women. Diabetes is a chronic condition and a lead- ing cause of death and disability in the United States, and is especially prevalent among minor-ity populations. Among women with any dis-ability or condition limiting their activity, 11.4 percent cited diabetes as the cause of the activ-ity limitation. In 2007, non-Hispanic Black women and Hispanic women were much more likely to suffer limitations due to diabetes (20.6 and 18.0 percent of women with any activity limitation) than non-Hispanic White women (8.9 percent). Some conditions, such as arthritis and heart disease, disproportionately affect non-Hispanic White women. For instance, in 2007, more than 27 percent of non-Hispanic White women had arthritis, compared to 22.2 percent of non-Hispanic Black women and 15.4 percent of Hispanic women. In addition to race and ethnicity, income and education are important factors that con-tribute to women's health and access to health care. Regardless of family structure, women are more likely than men to live in poverty. Pov-erty rates were highest among women who were heads of their households (24.9 percent). Pover-ty rates were also highest among non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women (23.4 percent), followed by non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women (23.3 and 20.8 percent, re-spectively). Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women were also more likely to be heads of households than their non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Asian counterparts. Some conditions and health risks are more closely linked to family income than to race and ethnicity, such as asthma. Rates of asthma decline as income increases and women with higher incomes are more likely to effectively manage their asthma. Among women with asthma whose incomes were below 100 percent of poverty, 32.4 percent had an asthma-related emergency room visit in the past year, compared to 14.5 percent of women with family incomes of 300 percent or more of poverty. Mental health is another important aspect of women's overall health. A range of mental health problems including depression, anxiety, phobias, and post-traumatic stress disorder, disproportionately affect women. Women with lower incomes were significantly more likely than those with higher incomes to report fre-quent depression and anxiety in 2007. Severe headaches and migraines were also more common among women than men, and were more common among women with lower family incomes. In 2007, nearly one-quarter of women with family incomes below 100 percent of poverty experienced severe headaches or mi-graines, compared to 14.8 percent of women with incomes of 400 percent or more of pov-erty. Physical disabilities are more prevalent among women as well. Disability can be defined as impairment of the ability to perform com-mon activities like walking up stairs, sitting or standing for 2 hours or more, grasping small ob-jects, or carrying items like groceries. Therefore, the terms \"activity limitations\" and \"disabilities\" are used interchangeably throughout this book. Overall, 15.6 percent of women and 13.0 per-cent of men reported having activity limitations in 2007. Men, however, bear a disproportionate bur- den of some health conditions, such as HIV/AIDS, hypertension, and heart disease. In 2006, for instance, the rate of newly reported HIV cases for adolescent and adult males was more than 3 times the rate for females (34.3 versus 11.9 per 100,000, respectively). Despite the greater risk, though, a smaller proportion of men had ever been tested for HIV than women (34.3 versus 38.8 percent, respectively). Certain health risks, such as cigarette use, illicit drug use, and injury, occur more com-monly among men than women. In 2007, 22.3 percent of men smoked cigarettes, compared to WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 INTRODUCTION 8 17.4 percent of women. Among men, 28.1 per- cent of emergency department visits were inju-ry-related, while only 20.4 percent of women's visits were due to injury. In addition, men were more likely than women to lack health insur-ance. Many diseases and health conditions, such as those mentioned above, can be avoided or mini-mized through good nutrition, regular physical activity, and preventive health care. In 2006, 21.5 percent of women's visits to physicians were for preventive care, including prenatal care, preventive screenings, and immunizations. In 2007, 66.3 percent women aged 65 years and older reported receiving a flu shot; however, this percentage ranged from 54.0 percent of His-panic women to 68.4 percent of non-Hispanic White women. In addition to preventive health care, pre- ventive dental care is also important to prevent dental caries and gum disease. In 2006, 65.7 percent of women reported receiving annual dental checkups; however, this was more com-mon among women in metropolitan areas than in non-metropolitan areas (67.3 versus 57.7 percent, respectively). There are many ways women (and men) can promote health and help prevent disease and disability. Regular physical activity is one of these. In 2007, 10.0 percent of women partici-pated in at least 30 minutes of moderate-inten-sity physical activity on most days of the week or 20 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity on 3 or more days per week. Non-Hispanic White women and women with higher incomes were most likely to meet this level of physical activ-ity. Healthy eating habits can also be a major contributor to long-term health and prevention of chronic disease. In 2005-2006, however, more than half of all women had diets that in-cluded more than the recommended amount of saturated fat and sodium and less than the recommended amount of folate and calcium. Overall, 63.0 percent of women exceeded the maximum recommended daily intake of sat- urated fat, and 68.0 percent exceeded the maxi-mum recommended amount of sodium. While some behaviors have a positive effect on health, a number of others, such as smok-ing, illicit drug use, and excessive alcohol use can have a negative effect. In 2007, 39.6 percent of women reported any alcohol use in the past year, but of those women, relatively few (13.4 percent) reported moderate drinking (more than three, up to seven drinks per week) and even fewer (7.7 percent) reported heavy drink-ing (more than seven drinks per week). In the same year, 12.6 percent of women used illicit drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, hallucino-gens, inhalants, and prescription-type drugs for non-medical purposes. Cigarette, alcohol, and illicit drug use is par- ticularly harmful during pregnancy. The use of tobacco during pregnancy has declined steadily since 1989. Based on data from 32 States and 2 reporting areas, 9.9 percent of pregnant women reported smoking during pregnancy in 2006. This rate was highest among non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women (16.9 percent) and lowest among non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander women (2.0 percent). Women's Health USA 2009 can be an impor- tant tool for emphasizing the importance of preventive care, counseling, and education, and for illustrating disparities in the health status of women from all age groups and racial and eth-nic backgrounds. Health problems can only be remedied if they are recognized. This data book provides information on a range of indicators that can help us track the health behaviors, risk factors, and health care utilization practices of women throughout the United States. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 9 PoPUlAtion cHArA cteriSticS Population characteristics describe the di- verse social, demographic, and economic fea- tures of the Nation's population. There were nearly 153 million females in the United States in 2007, representing slightly more than half of the population. Examining data by demographic factors such as sex, age, and race and ethnicity can serve a number of purposes for policymakers and pro-gram planners. For instance, these comparisons can be used to tailor the development and evalu-ation of policies and programs serving women. This section presents data on population characteristics that affect women's physical, so-cial, and mental health. Some of these charac-teristics include the age and racial and ethnic distribution of the population, household com-position, education, income, occupation, and participation in Federal programs.

Females younger than 35 years of age accounted for 45.9 percent of the female population, those aged 35 -64 years accounted for 39.9 percent, and females aged 65 years and older accounted for 14.3 percent. The distribution of the population by sex was fairly even across younger age groups; however, women accounted for a greater percentage of the older population than men. Of those aged 65 and older, 57.9 percent were women. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS 11 U.S. feMAle PoPUlA tion The growing diversity of the U.S. population is reflected in the racial and ethnic distribution of women across age groups. The younger fe-male population (under 15 years) is significant-ly more diverse than the older female popula-tion. In 2007, 55.9 percent of females under 15 years were non-Hispanic White, while 21.5 per-cent of that group were Hispanic. In contrast, among women aged 65 years and older, 80.2 percent were non-Hispanic White and only 6.5 percent were Hispanic. The distribution of the Black population was more consistent across age groups, ranging from 14.6 percent of females under 15 years of age to 8.9 percent of women aged 65 years and older. Evidence indicates that race and ethnicity represent important factors related to health disparities, that is, variations in rates of health conditions and chronic diseases in persons of different races and ethnicities. Coupled with the increasing diversity of the U.S. population, these health disparities make culturally-appro-priate, community-driven programs critical to improving the health of the entire U.S. popu-lation. 1 *Includes only non-institutionalized population not living in group housing.

More than 12 percent of women over age 18 were the heads of their households, meaning that they have children or other family members, but no spouse, living with them in a housing unit that they own or rent. Housing units may include houses, apart-ments, groups of rooms or a single room that is intended to be used as separate living quarters. Women who are heads of households include single mothers, single women with a parent or other close relative living in their home, and women with other household compositions. The remaining women lived alone (15.3 per-cent), with parents or other relatives (12.5 per-cent), or with non-relatives (6.9 percent). Women in households with no spouse pres- ent are more likely than women in married-couple families to have incomes below poverty (see \"Women and Poverty\" on the next page). In 2007, non-Hispanic Black women were most likely to be single heads of households (36.1 per-cent), while non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander women were least likely (8.0 percent). Hispanic women (19.0 percent) and non-Hispanic wom-en of other races (25.9 percent) were also more likely than non-Hispanic White women to be heads of households (12.0 percent).

With regard to race and ethnicity, non-Hispanic White women were least likely to experience poverty (9.0 per-cent), while non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women were most likely (23.4 percent), followed closely by non-Hispanic Black women (23.3 percent) and Hispanic women (20.8 percent).Poverty status varies with age. Among women of each race and ethnicity, those aged 45 -64 years were less likely to experience poverty than those aged 18 -44 and 65 years and older. For instance, 18.1 percent of non-Hispanic Black women aged 45-64 were in poverty in 2007, compared to 25.5 percent of non-Hispanic Black women aged 18-44 and 27.4 percent of those aged 65 years and older. Women in families\u2014a group of at least two people related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together\u2014experience higher rates of poverty than men in families (9.5 versus 6.2 percent, respectively). Men in families with no spouse present were considerably less likely to have family incomes below the poverty level than women in families with no spouse present (11.8 versus 24.9 percent, respectively). Female-headed households may also be more likely to experience homelessness than male-headed households. In a study of 16 cities, 65 percent of households with children experiencing homelessness were female-headed. 3 Adults in Familie s* Living Below the Poverty Level ,** by Household Type and Sex, 2007 Source I.4: U.S. Census Bureau, C urrent P opulation Su rvey 24.9Women Aged 18 and Older Living Below the Poverty Level ,* by Race/Ethnicity and Age, 2007 Source I.4: U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Su rvey Percent of Women *Families are groups of at least two people related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together . **Poverty level, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, was $21,027 for a family of four in 2007. *Poverty level, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, was $21,027 for a family of four in 2007 .Percent of Adults 11.8 4.8 4.99.5 6.2Female Male 9.423.4 10.7 No Spouse , Married CoupleAdults in Families , 17.2 10.420.0 11.1 8.312.524.2 20.727.8 18.1 WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS 14 food SecUritY Food security is defined as having access at all times to enough nutritionally adequate and safe foods to lead a healthy, active lifestyle.4 Food se- curity status is assessed through a series of ques-tions such as whether people worried that food would run out before there would be money to buy more; whether an individual or his/her family cut the size of meals or skipped meals because there was not enough money for food; and whether an individual or his/her family had ever gone a whole day without eating because there was not enough food. In 2007, an estimated 36.2 million people lived in households that were classified as not fully food secure. 4 Households or persons ex-periencing food insecurity may be categorized as experiencing low food security or very low food security (formerly referred to as \"food insecurity with hunger\"). Low food security generally indicates multiple food access issues, while very low food security indicates reduced food intake and disrupted eating patterns due to inadequate resources for food. Periods of low or very low food security may be occasional or episodic, placing the members of a household at greater nutritional risk due to insufficient access to nutritionally adequate and safe foods. Mar-ginal food security indicates some problems ac-cessing food, but not enough to qualify as food insecure.In 2005 -2006, nearly 17 percent of women lived in households that were not fully food secure, and this percentage varied by age. The proportion of women who were fully food se-cure increased as age increased. Women aged 65 years and older were most likely to be fully food secure (90.7 percent), while 18- to 24-year-olds were least likely (74.8 percent). Food security status also varies by household composition. While adult men and women liv-ing alone had similar rates of food insecurity in 2007, female-headed households with no spouse present were more likely than male-headed households with no spouse present to experience food insecurity (30.2 versus 18.0 percent, respectively). 010 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100Food Insecure**Marginally Food Secure Fully Food Secure 65 Years and Older45-64 Years25-44 Years18-24 YearsTotalFood Security Status of Women Aged 18 and Olde r,* by Age, 2005-2006 Source I.5: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for He alth St atistics, National H ealth and N utrition Examination SurveyFood Security Status Among Adults Aged 18 and Olde r, by Household Composition * and Sex, 2007 Source I.6: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic R esearch Service Percent of Wo men Percent of Adults *Percentages may not add to totals due to rounding. *Based on household food security status. **Includes \"low\" and \"very low\" food security .74.8 5.9 3.4 6.2 85.27.5 8.0 10.8 81.29.1 11.4 13.8 8.6 5101520253035 Adults in Families, No Spouse PresentAdults in SecurityVery Low FoodSecurityFood InsecureFemale Male WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS 15 WoMen And feder Al nUtrition ProGrAMS Federal programs can provide low-income women and their families with essential help in obtaining food and income support. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly the Federal Food Stamp Pro-gram, helps low-income individuals purchase food. In 2007, more than 13 million adults participated in SNAP; of these, nearly 9 million (67.8 percent) were women. Among participat-ing women, nearly 4.1 million (45.7 percent) were in the 18- to 35-year-old age group.The number of people participating in SNAP increased significantly in 2008 due to the eco-nomic downturn resulting in an addition of nearly 4 million people of all ages from January through September 2008 alone. 5 Female-headed households with children make up 30.5 percent of households that rely on food stamps, and represent nearly 60 percent of food stamp households with children (data not shown). The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) also plays an important role in serving women and families by providing supplementary nutrition during pregnancy, the postpartum period, and while breastfeeding. More than three-quarters of all WIC participants are infants and chil-dren (75.3 percent); however, the program also serves more than 2 million pregnant women and mothers, representing 24.7 percent of WIC participants in 2008. During the years 1992 - 2008, the number of women participating in WIC increased by 75.6 percent, and it con-tinues to rise. 4,0924,2488,958 1,4953,300 2,053 1,566 700Adult Recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,* by Age and Sex, 2007** Source I.7: U.S. Department of Agriculture, F ood St amp Quality Control S ampleWomen Participating in WIC ,* 1992-2008** Source I.8: U.S. Department of Agriculture, WIC ogram rticipation DataNumber in Thousands Number of WomenFemale Male 200,0001,200,0001,400,0001,600,0001,800,0002,000,0002,200,000 2008 2006 2004 2002 2000 1998 1996 1994 19921,226,11 51,499,2181,647,3381,734,0331,748,7921,812,7861,931,651 1,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,0008,0009,000 60 Years and Older 36-59 Years 18-35 Years Total (18 Years and Older )*Participants are classified as women, infants, or children based on nutritional-risk status; data reported includ e all pregnant women and mothers regardless of age. **Based on Federal Fiscal Year (October -September). * Formerly the Food Stamp Program. **Based on Federal Fiscal Year (October -September).2,023,3092,152,985 WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS 16 edUcAtion Al deGreeS And HeAltH ProfeSSion ScHoolS The number of post-secondary educational degrees awarded to women rose from just over half a million in the 1969 -1970 academic year to more than 1.7 million in 2005 -2006. Al- though the number of degrees earned by men has also increased, the rate of growth among women has been much faster; therefore, the proportion of degrees earned by women has risen dramatically. In 1969 -1970, men earned a majority of every type of post-secondary degree, while in 2005 -2006, women earned more than half of all associate's, bachelor's, and master's degrees and nearly half of all first professional and doctoral degrees. The most significant in-crease has been in the proportion of first pro-fessional degree earners who are women, which jumped from 5.3 percent in 1969 -1970 to 49.8 percent in 2005 -2006. The total number of women earning their first professional degree in 2005 -2006 (43,617) was 24 times greater than in 1969 -1970 (1,841). While the sex disparity in degrees awarded has decreased, a racial/ethnic disparity remains among women enrolled in schools for health professions. During the 2007 -2008 academic year, non-Hispanic White women accounted for more than half of all women enrolled in schools of medicine, optometry, pharmacy, and public health, while fewer than 10 percent of women enrolled in these schools were Hispanic. Non-Hispanic Black women were also under-represented among female students enrolled in schools of medicine, pharmacy, and optom-etry (9.0, 7.0, and 3.6 percent, respectively). In comparison, non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander women were overrepresented relative to their representation within the population, accounting for 30.3 percent of female students of optometry, 20.3 percent of female students of medicine, and 21.3 percent of female pharmacy students. 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100Public Healt hPharmacyOptometryMedicine Percent of DegreesDegrees Awarded to Wo men, by Ty pe, 1969-1970 and 2005-2006 Source I.9: U.S. Department of Education, D igest of Education S tatisticsWomen in Selected Schools for Health Professions, by Race/Ethnicity, 2007-2008 Source I.10: Professional Associations *Includes fields osteopathic , podiatry veterinary medicine, chiropractic, law , and theological professions. **Includes Doctor of Philosophy degree and degrees awarded for fulfilling specialized requirements in professional fields such as education, musical arts, and engineering.

This represents a 35 percent increase from the 43.3 percent of women who were in the labor force in 1970. 6 In 2007, females accounted for 46.6 percent of workers, while males accounted for 53.4 percent (data not shown). The representation of females in the labor force varies greatly by occupational sector. In 2007, women accounted for 62.9 percent of sales and office workers, but only 3.4 percent of construction, extraction, and maintenance workers. Other positions which were more commonly held by women than men included service jobs (56.4 percent) and management, professional, and related jobs (51.2 percent). Women were the minority in production, trans-portation, and material moving (22.8 percent); farming, fishing, and forestry (20.5 percent); and in the military (14.3 percent). In 2007, a total of 200,337 women were on active duty in the armed services. Overall, in 2007 there was a large discrep- ancy between the annual median earnings of women and men working full-time ($34,103 versus $44,250, respectively), and this discrep-ancy existed within each occupational sector. Men's median earnings were approximately 40 percent higher than women's in management and professional; service; and production, trans-portation, and material moving occupations. The smallest disparity was evident in the con-struction, extraction, and maintenance occupa-tional sector: men's median earnings were only 7.4 percent higher than women's. The percentage of women working full-time has steadily increased in recent years.

This number is projected to rise to 1.9 million by 2013. The percentage of veterans who are female has in-creased by more than 25 percent in recent years. In 2000, 6.1 percent of all living veterans were women, while women accounted for 7.7 percent of living veterans in 2008. Women are expected to account for 8.8 percent of the veteran popula-tion by 2013. Female veterans are eligible for the same De- partment of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits as male veterans. Comprehensive health services are available to all women veterans including primary care, gynecology and maternity care, mental health care, and specialty health care services. Full-time Women Veterans Program Managers are available at all VA facilities to help women veterans seeking treatment and benefits. For more information, visit http://www.va.gov/womenshealth/. Of the 7.8 million veterans who are enrolled in the VA for health care, women account for more than 500,000 enrollees. The proportion of VA enrollees who are women is expected to increase to 1 in 7 over the next 10 years. The ma-jority of new female veterans\u2014from Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF)\u2014are more likely to obtain their health care from VA facilities than previous female vet-erans. Women are changing the landscape of care in the VA and not by their numbers alone. Women veterans of OEF/OIF are younger than women veterans of the past; more than three-quarters of OEF/OIF women veterans who are enrolled in VA health care are between 20 and 40 years old (i.e., of child-bearing age). These women are likely to be balancing work, motherhood, and transition to civilian life and will rely on the VA to provide high-quality, age-appropriate, and woman-specific care.

T rends in health status help to identify new is-sues as they emerge. In this section, health status indicators related to morbidity, mortality, health behaviors, and maternal health are presented. New topics in-clude bleeding disorders and hearing problems, as well as severe headaches and migraines. In addition, a new section provides State-by-State data on the leading causes of death, smoking, and obesity among women. The data through-out this section are displayed by sex, age, race and ethnicity, and income, where feasible. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH BEHAVIORS 20 PHYSicAl A ctiVitY Regular physical activity promotes health, psychological well-being, and a healthy body weight; enhances independent living; and im-proves one's quality of life. The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans states that for substantial health benefits, women should en-gage in at least 2\u00bd hours per week of moderate-intensity or 1\u00bc hours per week of vigorous-in-tensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both. Additional health ben-efits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond this amount. 1 Prior to these guidelines, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2005, recommended that adults engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity, above usual activity at work or home on most, or preferably all, days of the week. 2 In 2007, only 10.0 percent of women re- ported participating in adequate physical activ-ity (defined as engaging in physical activity of moderate intensity for at least 30 minutes per day on a minimum of 5 days per week or vig-orous-intensity activity for at least 20 minutes per day for a minimum of 3 days per week). The percentage of women reporting regular physi-cal activity varied by race/ethnicity, age, and income. In 2007, non-Hispanic White women were more likely than women of other races and ethnicities to report adequate physical activ-ity (11.6 percent). Hispanic women were least likely to report adequate physical activity (5.8 percent). Among women in all income groups, rates of adequate physical activity peak during the ages of 25 -44 years and decline as women grow older. In addition, among women aged 25 years and older, those with higher incomes are more likely to engage in adequate physical activity than those with lower incomes. In 2007, the women most likely to do so were those aged 25-44 years with incomes of 200 percent or more of poverty (17.4 percent), compared to 13.8 percent of women in the same age group with incomes of 100 -199 percent of poverty and 11.4 percent of those with incomes less than 100 percent of poverty.Percent of WomenPercent of WomenWomen Aged 18 and Older Engaging in Adequate * Physical Activity , by Age and Poverty Status, ** 2007 Source II.1: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for He alth Statistics, Na tional He alth I nterview Survey *Adequate physical activity is defined as 30 minutes per day or more of moderate-intensity activity on 5 or more days per week or 20 minutes per day of vigorous-intensity activity on 3 or more days per week. **Includes Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, American Indian/Alaska Natives, persons of other races, persons of more than one race, and persons of unspecified race .*Adequate physical activity is defined as 30 minutes per day or more of moderate-intensity activity on 5 or more days per week or 20 minutes per day of vigorous-intensity activity on 3 or more days per week . **Poverty level, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, was $21,027 for a family of four in 2007.Women Aged 18 and Older Engaging in Adequate * Physical Activity, by Race/Ethnicity , 2007 Source II.1: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for H ealth Statistics, Na tional H ealth I nterview Survey 100% of Poverty 100-199% of Povert y 5101520 Non-Hispanic BlackNon-Hispanic WhiteTotal10.412.2200% or More of Poverty WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH BEHAVIORS 21 nUtrition The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2005 recommends eating a variety of nutrient-dense foods while not exceeding caloric needs. For most people, this means eating a daily assort-ment of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean meats and beans, and low-fat or fat-free milk products while limiting added sugar, sodium, saturated and trans fats, and cholesterol. 2 Fats that come from sources of polyunsatu- rated or monounsaturated fatty acids, such as fish, nuts, and vegetable oils, are an important part of a healthy diet. However, high intake of saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol may in- crease the risk of coronary heart disease. Most Americans should consume fewer than 10 per-cent of calories from saturated fats, less than 300 mg/day of cholesterol, and keep trans fatty acid consumption to a minimum. In 2005 -2006, 63.0 percent of women exceeded the recom-mended maximum daily intake of saturated fat\u2014particularly non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black women (65.7 and 59.4 percent, respectively). Salt also plays an important role in heart health, as high salt intake can contribute to high blood pressure. In 2005 -2006, 68.0 percent of women exceeded the recommended maximum intake of less than 2,300 mg/day of sodium, or about 1 teaspoon of salt. Inadequate calcium consumption can lead to lower bone density, bone loss, and increased risk of osteoporosis. The recommended Ad-equate Intake (AI) for calcium is 1,000 mg/day for women aged 19 -50 and 1,200 mg/day for women aged 51 years and older. In 2005 -2006, fewer than one-quarter of women met or ex-ceeded the recommended AI for calcium. Folate is also an important part of a healthy diet, especially among women of childbearing age, since it can help reduce the risk of neural tube defects early in pregnancy. In 2005 -2006, only 32.8 percent of women consumed the Rec-ommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for folate (400 mcg/day). Fewer than one-quarter of non-Hispanic Black women consumed the RDA for folate, compared to slightly more than one-third of non-Hispanic White and Hispanic women.

Although there is some debate over the health benefits of small amounts of alcohol consumed regularly, the negative health effects of excessive alcohol use and abuse are well established. 3 Short-term effects can in- clude increased risk of motor vehicle injuries, falls, intimate partner violence, and child abuse. Long-term effects can include pancreatitis, high blood pressure, liver cirrhosis, various cancers, and psychological disorders, including alcohol dependency.

Non-Hispanic White women were most likely to be current drinkers (46.1 percent), followed by non-Hispanic women of other races (35.7 percent) and non-Hispanic Black women (27.6 percent). Women with higher household incomes were more likely than women with lower incomes to be current drinkers, and this was true for every racial and ethnic group. For instance, 34.4 percent of Hispanic women with incomes of 200 percent or more of poverty were current drinkers, compared to 15.0 percent of those with incomes below 100 percent of poverty. Among current drinkers, the level of alcohol consumption varies by sex. In 2007, women were more likely than men to have consumed alcohol infrequently (1 -11 drinks in the past year) or to have engaged in light alcohol consumption (3 or fewer drinks per week). More than half of women who drank in the past year were considered light drinkers (50.8 percent), compared to 45.2 percent of men. Men, however, were much more likely than women to be moderate drinkers (between 4 and 7 drinks for women or between 4 and 14 drinks for men): 32.0 percent of men and 13.4 percent of women were moderate drinkers. The average number of drinks consumed by current drinkers in the past year also varied by sex. On average, men consumed more drinks on days when they drank at all than women (3.0 versus 2.0 drinks, respectively; data not shown).

Cigarette smoke contains toxic ingredi-ents that prevent red blood cells from carrying a full load of oxygen, impairs genes that con-trol the growth of cells, and binds to the air-ways of smokers. This contributes to numer-ous chronic illnesses, including several types of cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, reduced bone density and fertility, and premature death. 4 In 2007, 19.8 percent of adults aged 18 and older smoked cigarettes some days or every day. Current cigarette smoking varied by sex and race/ethnicity. Men were more likely to smoke cigarettes than women overall (22.3 versus 17.4 percent, respectively), and in most racial and ethnic groups. Among women, non-Hispanic women of other races were most likely to be cur-rent cigarette smokers (31.0 percent), followed by non-Hispanic White women (19.8 percent). Non-Hispanic Asian women were least likely to smoke cigarettes (4.0 percent). The likelihood of being a current cigarette smoker declines as a person's level of education increases. In 2006, women aged 25 years and older with less than a high school diploma were most likely to smoke cigarettes (26.0 percent), while only 7.2 percent of those with a college degree or higher did so. Cigarette smoking among women of every education level has de-clined in the past decade. Quitting smoking has major and immedi- ate health benefits, including reducing the risk of diseases caused by smoking and improving overall health. 4 In 2007, more than 44 percent of current female smokers aged 18 and older re-ported trying to quit at least once in the past year; however, this varied by age. Women aged 18-44 were most likely to have attempted quit- ting smoking (48.6 percent), followed by wom-en aged 45 -64 years (41.3 percent). Fewer than 30 percent of female cigarette smokers aged 65 years and older attempted to do so (data not shown).

In 2007, nearly 12.6 million women aged 18 years and older re-ported using an illicit drug within the past year, representing 10.9 percent of this population. In comparison, 18.4 million men, represent-ing 17.1 percent of the adult male population, used at least one illicit drug in the past year (data not shown). Past-year illicit drug use was highest among females aged 18 -25 years (29.1 percent), followed by females aged 12 -17 years (18.0 percent); past-year use was lowest among women aged 26 years and older (7.9 percent). Use of all drug types, except inhalants, was highest among females aged 18 -25 years, with 23.1 percent reporting past-year marijuana use and 13.7 percent reporting non-medical use of prescription-type psychotherapeutic drugs. Use of inhalants in the past year was highest among females aged 12 -17 (4.0 percent), compared to 0.9 percent of those aged 18 -25 and 0.1 per- cent of those aged 26 years and older. Marijuana was the most commonly used illicit drug among females aged 12 -17 and 18 - 25 years, and was the second most commonly used drug among women 26 years and older. Short-term effects of marijuana use can include difficulty thinking and solving problems, memory and learning problems, and distorted perception. Non-medical use of psychotherapeutics was the most commonly used drug among women aged 26 years and older and was the second most commonly used drug among younger females. Prescription drugs commonly used or abused for non-medical purposes include opi-oids, central nervous system depressants, and stimulants. Long-term use of these drugs can lead to physical dependence and addiction. In addition, when taken in large doses, stimulant use can lead to compulsivity, paranoia, danger-ously high body temperature, and an irregular heartbeat. 5 The percentage of women reporting non- medical use of psychotherapeutics varied by race and ethnicity. Among women aged 18 and older, American Indian/Alaska Natives were most likely to report the use of psychothera-peutics in the past year (8.5 percent), followed by non-Hispanic women of multiple races (7.6 percent), and non-Hispanic White women (6.1 percent). Slightly more than 4 percent of non-Hispanic Black women and 5.0 percent of Hispanic women also reported non-medical use of psychotherapeutics.

Among both sexes, self-reported health status improves with income. Women and men with incomes less than 100 percent of poverty were least likely to report excellent or very good health (42.2 and 47.6 percent, respectively), compared to about 60 percent of men and women with incomes of 200-299 percent of poverty and 73 percent of those with incomes of 300 percent or more of poverty. Self-reported health status declines with in- creasing age: 70.3 percent of women aged 18 - 44 years reported excellent or very good health, compared to 55.6 percent of those aged 45 -64 years, 42.8 percent of those aged 65 -74 years, and 32.8 percent of those aged 75 years and old-er. Among women in the oldest age group, 30.9 percent reported fair or poor health, compared to only 6.5 percent of those in the youngest age group.

White females could expect to live 4.1 years longer than Black females. The lower life expec-tancy among Blacks may be partly accounted for by higher infant mortality rates. Life expectancy has steadily increased since 1970 for males and females in both racial groups. Between 1970 and 2006, White males' life expectancy increased from 68.0 to 75.7 years (11.3 percent), while White females' life expectancy increased from 75.6 to 80.6 years (6.6 percent). During the same period, the life expectancy for Black males increased from 60.0 to 69.7 years (16.2 percent), while life expec-tancy increased from 68.3 to 76.5 years (11.7 percent) for Black females.Life expectancy data have not been uniformly calculated and reported for the Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native populations. According to the most re-cent estimates available, an American Indian/Alaska Native born in 1999 -2001 could expect to live 74.5 years; this represents a 17.1 percent increase over the life expectancy in 1972 -1974 (63.6 years). 6 The U.S. Census Bureau esti- mated that Hispanics born in 1999 would have a life expectancy of 83.7 years for females and 77.2 years for males. Asian males born in 1999 had a life expectancy of 80.9 years, while life expectancy for Asian females born in that year was 86.5 years (data not shown). 7 Life Expectancy at Birth, by Race * and Sex, 1970-2006 Source II.4: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for He alth S 58 56 26062646769717375777982 2006 2000 1995 1990 1985 1980 1975 1970 *Both racial categories include Hispanics.

Of these deaths, nearly half were attributable to heart disease and malignant neoplasms (cancer), responsible for 25.8 and 22.0 percent of deaths, respectively. The next two leading causes of death were cere-brovascular diseases (stroke), which accounted for 6.7 percent of deaths, and chronic lower re-spiratory disease, which accounted for 5.3 per-cent. Among females aged 1 -34 years of age, unintentional injury was the leading cause of death (data not shown). Heart disease was the leading cause of death for women in most racial and ethnic groups; the exceptions were non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native females, for whom the leading cause of death was cancer. One of the most no-ticeable differences in leading causes of death by race and ethnicity is that diabetes mellitus was the eighth leading cause of death among non-Hispanic White females, while it was the fourth among all other racial and ethnic groups. Similarly, chronic lower respiratory disease was the fourth leading cause of death among non-Hispanic White females while it ranked sixth or seventh among other racial and ethnic groups. Death in the perinatal period was the ninth leading cause of death among Hispanic females, accounting for 2.1 percent of deaths, and hy-pertension was the tenth leading cause among non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander females, accounting for 1.6 percent of deaths (data not shown). Also noteworthy is that non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native females experi-enced a higher proportion of deaths due to un-intentional injury (8.2 percent) and liver disease (4.1 percent; seventh leading cause of death) than females of other racial and ethnic groups.

In 2007, nearly 14.4 percent of adults reported having at least one condition that lim-ited their ability to perform one or more of these common activities (data not shown). Women were more likely than men to report being lim-ited in their activities (15.6 versus 13.0 percent, respectively).The percentage of adults reporting at least one activity limitation varied with age among both men and women. Only 6.5 percent of women aged 18 -44 years reported any activity limita- tion, compared to 28.9 percent of women aged 65-74 years and 47.9 percent of women aged 75 years or older. In 2007, the percentage of women report- ing at least one activity limitation varied by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic Black women were most likely to report at least one limitation (18.4 percent), followed by non-Hispanic White wom-en (16.5 percent). Asian women were least likely to report any activity limitation (7.1 percent). More than 10 percent of Hispanic women also reported an activity limitation (data not shown). Among women with any activity limitations, the causes of these limitations also varied by race and ethnicity. For instance, 30.1 percent of non-Hispanic Black women who were limited in some way cited arthritis or rheumatism as the condition limiting their activity, compared to 26.5 percent of non-Hispanic White and 25.5 percent of Hispanic women. Depression, anxi-ety, and emotional problems were the cause of ac-tivity limitation among 16.8 percent of Hispanic women, 12.4 percent of non-Hispanic White and 9.7 percent of non-Hispanic Black women.

Arthritis is the second most common cause of work disability and restricts daily activities such as walking, dressing, and bathing for more than seven million Americans. 8 The most common type is osteoarthritis, which is a degenerative joint disease that causes pain and loss of movement due to deterioration in the cartilage covering the ends of bones in the joints. Types of arthritis that primarily affect women include lupus arthritis, fibromyalgia, and rheu-matoid arthritis, which is the most serious and disabling type of arthritis. 8 In 2007, nearly 21 percent of adults in the United States reported that they had ever been diagnosed with arthritis; this represents more than 46 million adults (data not shown). Arthri-tis was more common among women than men (24.2 versus 17.3 percent, respectively), and rates of arthritis increased dramatically with age for both sexes. Fewer than 8 percent of women aged 18 -44 years had been diagnosed with ar- thritis, compared to 47.4 percent of women aged 65 -74 years, and 57.5 percent of women aged 75 years and older. In 2007, the rate of arthritis among women varied by race and ethnicity. Arthritis was most common among non-Hispanic White women (27.2 percent), followed by non-Hispanic wom-en of other races (23.2 percent) and non-Hispan-ic Black women (22.2 percent).

This disorder may be aggravated by allergens, tobacco smoke and other irritants, exercise, and infections of the respiratory tract. However, by taking certain precautions, persons with asthma may be able to effectively manage this disorder and participate in daily activities. In 2007, women were more likely to have asthma than men (9.0 versus 5.4 percent, re-spectively); this was true in every racial and ethnic group. Among women, non-Hispanic Black women were most likely to have asthma (9.8 percent), followed by non-Hispanic White women (9.3 percent). Non-Hispanic women of other races and Hispanic women were least likely to have asthma (6.6 and 7.9 percent, re-spectively). A visit to the emergency room due to asthma may be an indication that the asthma is not ef-fectively controlled or treated. In 2007, asth-matic women with family incomes below pov-erty were more likely than women with higher family incomes to have an emergency room visit due to asthma. Among women with fam-ily incomes less than 100 percent of poverty, 32.4 percent of those with asthma had visited the emergency room in the past year, compared to 14.5 percent of asthmatic women with fam-ily incomes of 300 percent or more of poverty. Consistent access to and use of medication can reduce the use of hospital and emergency room care for people with asthma. 9Percent of Adluts Percent of Women with AsthmaAdults Aged 18 and Older with Asthma, * by Race/Ethnicity and Sex, 2007 Source II.1: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for H ealth Statistics, Na tional H ealth I nterview Survey *Reported that (1) a health professional has ever told them that they have asthma, and (2) they still hav e asthma.

This hinders blood clotting and makes it harder for the body to stop bleed-ing. One widely recognized bleeding disorder, hemophilia, sometimes occurs in females; more often, however, females carry the gene that causes the disorder. The most common bleeding disorder among females is von Willebrand Dis-ease (VWD). Up to 3 million Americans, half of whom are female, have VWD. Typical symp-toms of VWD and other bleeding disorders for females include heavy menstrual periods, easy bruising, frequent nosebleeds, and prolonged bleeding after minor injuries, surgery, child-birth, or dental work. Of the approximately 12 percent of menstruating girls and women who have heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), 10 13 percent may have an inherited bleeding dis-order. 11 Unfortunately, most of these disorders go undiagnosed. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Service's National Institutes of Health recently published guidelines about diagnosing, evaluat-ing, and treating VWD. Diagnosing a bleeding disorder requires taking a personal medical his-tory, a family medical history, and conducting special laboratory tests. Fortunately, many of these disorders can be treated, allowing affected women to live a normal life. The guidelines can be found at www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/vwd/. Experts in diagnosing and treating bleeding disorders can be found throughout the United States and its jurisdictions at more than 130 federally-funded hemophilia treatment centers (HTC). HTC treat a wide range of bleeding dis-orders, primarily inherited bleeding and clotting disorders. From 1991 to 2007, the number of female HTC patients grew nearly 300 percent, from 2,365 to 9,041. To locate an HTC, visit http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hbd/htc_list.htm.

Lung and bronchus cancer is expected to be the leading cause of cancer death among females, accounting for 70,490 deaths, or 26 percent of all cancer deaths, followed by breast cancer, which will be responsible for 40,170, or 15 percent of deaths. Colon and rectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and ovarian cancer will also be significant causes of cancer deaths among females, accounting for an additional 56,490 deaths combined.Due to the varying survival rates for differ- ent types of cancer, the most common causes of cancer death are not always the most common types of cancer. For instance, although lung and bronchus cancers cause the greatest number of deaths, breast cancer is more commonly diag-nosed among women. In 2005, invasive breast cancer occurred among 117.7 per 100,000 wom-en whereas lung and bronchus cancers occurred in only 55.2 per 100,000 women. Other types of cancer that are commonly diagnosed among females but are not among the top 10 causes of cancer deaths include melanoma, thyroid, and cervical cancer, occurring in 15.1, 14.9, and 8.1 per 100,000 women, respectively. Cervical cancer incidence varies by race and ethnicity; in 2005, Hispanic and Black females were most likely to have been diagnosed with in-vasive cervical cancer (12.4 and 10.3 per 100,000, respectively), compared to 7.7 per 100,000 White females. Cervical cancer screenings are recom-mended at least every 3 years beginning within 3 years of sexual activity or by age 21.

Overall, non-Hispanic White and Black women aged 65 years and older were most likely to have this type of cancer (92.1 and 84.3 per 100,000 women, respectively), followed by Hispanic women of the same age group (57.7 per 100,000). Among 45- to 64-year-olds, American Indian/Alaska Native women were least likely to have endome-trial or uterine cancer (29.9 per 100,000), while Black women were least likely among those aged 20-44 years (4.1 per 100,000). Survival rates for ovarian cancer vary depend- ing on how early it is discovered. For females diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1996 -2004, 45.6 percent could expect to live 5 years or more; however, this varied by race and the stage of the cancer. Black women were slightly more likely than White women to live at least 5 years when the cancer was diagnosed in the localized stage (94.3 versus 92.1 percent, respectively). Comparatively, 71.3 percent of White females and 50.7 percent of Black females could expect the same when the cancer is in the regional stage (spread beyond the primary site). Among those whose cancer is diagnosed at the distant stage (spread to distant organs or lymph nodes), only 30.7 percent of White females and 22.6 percent of Black females could expect to live 5 more years.

Complications of diabetes are serious and may include blindness, kidney dam-age, heart disease, stroke, and nervous system disease. Diabetes is becoming increasingly com-mon among children and young adults. The main types of diabetes are Type 1, Type 2, and gestational (occurring only during pregnancy). Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, but may occur at any age. Type 2 diabetes is the most common; it is of-ten diagnosed among adults but has increased among children. Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes include obesity, physical inactivity, and a family history of the disease. In 2005 -2006, 76.0 per 1,000 adults report- ed that they had been told by a health profes-sional that they have diabetes (data not shown). Women were slightly more likely than men to have diabetes overall (81.2 versus 70.4 per 1,000 adults, respectively) and in most age groups. Diabetes prevalence generally increases with age. Fewer than 30 per 1,000 women aged 18 - 44 years had diabetes, compared to 197.5 per 1,000 women aged 65 -74 years. Women aged 55-64 and 75 years and older also had relative- ly high rates of diabetes (155.5 and 153.4 per 1,000 women, respectively). Among adults aged 18 years and older who were found to have diabetes (based on the results of a Fasting Plasma Glucose test), 33.2 percent had never been told by a health professional that they have diabetes.

In 2005 -2006, 32.4 percent of adults were overweight (BMI of 25.0-29.9), while an additional 33.8 percent were obese (BMI of 30.0 or more; data not shown). While women and men had similar rates of obesity in 2005 -2006 (35.0 and 32.4 percent, respectively), rates among women varied by pov-erty status. Among women, obesity was lowest among those with higher incomes. More than 40 percent of women with household incomes below 200 percent of the poverty level were obese, compared to 31.6 percent of women with incomes of 300 percent or more of poverty and 33.6 percent of those with incomes of 200 -299 percent of poverty. Among men, however, obe-sity rates did not vary significantly with poverty status.

Digestive disorders are estimated to affect 60 -70 million people in the United States. 15 While recent data are not readily available on the prevalence of many of these diseases by race and ethnicity or sex, it is estimated that 8.5 mil-lion people in the United States are affected by hemorrhoids each year; 2.1 million people are affected by irritable bowel syndrome; and gall-stones affect 20.5 million people. 15 Peptic ulcers are most commonly caused by a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). H. pylori weakens the mucous coating of the stomach and duodenum, allowing acids to ir-ritate the sensitive lining beneath. In 2007, 7.1 percent of adults reported that they had ever been told by a health professional that they have an ulcer (data not shown). Among women, the likelihood of having ever had an ulcer increased with age. Women aged 65 years and older were most likely to have reported ever having had an ulcer (11.1 percent), followed by women aged 45-64 years (8.6 percent). In comparison, fewer than 4 percent of women aged 18 -24 years had ever had an ulcer. There was also some variation among wom- en reporting having ever had an ulcer by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic White women were most likely to report having had an ulcer (8.3 percent), followed by non-Hispanic Black (5.6 percent) and Hispanic women (5.3 per-cent). Asian women were least likely to report ever having had an ulcer (3.5 percent; data not shown).Women with family incomes below 200 per- cent of the poverty line were also more likely than women with incomes above that threshold to have ever had an ulcer (9.8 versus 6.8 per-cent, respectively; data not shown).

Endo-crine disorders include hypothyroidism, con-genital adrenal hyperplasia, diseases of the adrenal glands (including Cushing's syndrome and Addison's disease), and ovarian dysfunction (including polycystic ovary syndrome), among others. Some examples of metabolic disorders fibrosis, Polycystic (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders among women of reproductive age, and is the most common cause of endocrine-related female in-fertility in the United States. An estimated 1 in 10 women of childbearing age has PCOS, and it can occur in females as young as 11 years of age. In addition, PCOS may put women at risk for other health conditions, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes. 17 Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are also common endocrine disorders. In 2005 - 2006, women were nearly five times more likely than men to report having ever been told by a health professional that they have a thyroid problem (16.4 versus 3.4 percent, respectively; data not shown). Among women, rates varied by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic White women were most likely to report a thyroid problem (18.5 percent), while Hispanic women were least likely (9.2 percent). In 2006, the rate of physician visits due to endocrine and metabolic disorders varied by sex: 4.0 percent of physician visits made by men were for disorders of endocrine glands other than the thyroid, compared to 3.1 percent of visits made by women. The rate of visits due to metabolic and immunity disorders was also higher among men than women (2.7 versus 1.9 percent of visits, respectively).

These disorders include dys-menorrhea (pain associated with menstruation), vulvodynia (unexplained chronic discomfort or pain of the vulva), and chronic pelvic pain (a persistent and severe pain occurring primarily in the lower abdomen for at least 6 months). Some problems can affect the proper func- tioning of the reproductive system and may af-fect a woman's ability to get pregnant. One ex-ample, polycystic ovary syndrome, occurs when immature follicles in the ovaries form together to create a large cyst, preventing mature eggs from being released. Another reproductive disorder, endometriosis, occurs when the type of tissue that lines the uterus grows elsewhere, such as on the ovaries or other abdominal organs. Uterine fibroids are non-cancerous tumors that grow in the uterine cavity, within the wall of the uterus, or on the outside of the uterus. In 2005 -2006, 9.3 percent of women aged 20-54 years had ever been told by a health pro- fessional that they have endometriosis and 12.6 percent had been told that they have uterine fibroids. Overall, endometriosis was most com-mon among those aged 35 -44 years (13.4 per- cent), while uterine fibroids were most common among those aged 45 -54 years (25.6 percent). In 2006, 34.1 per 1,000 physician visits among women aged 18 years and older were for gynecological or reproductive problems. Wom-en aged 18 -24 years were most likely to visit a physician for gynecological or reproductive disorders (57.8 per 1,000 visits), while women aged 65 years and older were least likely (16.7 per 1,000). Some women take supplemental hormones for gynecological or other health problems, sometimes to reduce the symptoms of meno-pause. In 2005 -2006, 27.0 percent of females reported ever having taken female hormones (not including birth control or fertility medi-cations). Non-Hispanic White women (31.8 percent) were more likely than non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women to report having ever taken hormones (17.2 and 11.6 percent, respectively; data not shown). 18 Endometriosis and Uterine Fibroids Among Wo men Aged 20-54,* by Age, 2005-2006 Source I.5: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for He alth Statistics, Na tional H ealth and FibroidsEndometriosis 12.6 9.3 *Reported a health professional had ever told them they have endometriosis or uterine fibroids .

In 2007, 85.1 percent of adults report-ed excellent or good hearing without the use of an aid, while 14.7 percent reported at least some trouble hearing and 0.2 percent were deaf (data not shown). Women were less likely than men to have reported trouble hearing overall (11.9 ver-sus 17.7 percent, respectively), and in every age group. For instance, among adults aged 75 years and older, 37.6 percent of women had trouble hearing compared to 53.1 percent of men. The percentage of adults who reported trouble hearing increased with age for both men and women. Among women, 5.0 percent of 18- to 44-year-olds reported trouble hearing without the use of an aid, compared to 12.4 percent of those aged 45 -64 years and 24.7 percent of those aged 65 -74. The use of hearing aids also increases with age. Among women, 13.8 percent of those aged 75 and older reported using a hearing aid, while only 3.8 percent of 65- to 74-year-olds and fewer than 1 percent of those aged 45 -64 years did so. Tinnitus is the term used for a persistent ring- ing, buzzing, or roaring sound in the ears or head. In 2007, 8.8 percent of women reported symptoms congruent with tinnitus. This varied, however, by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic White women were more likely than non-His-panic Black and Hispanic women to have tinni-tus (9.6 versus 7.6 and 6.6 percent, respectively).

Heart disease describes any disorder that prevents the heart from functioning normally. The most common type of heart disease is coronary heart disease, in which the arteries of the heart slowly narrow, reducing blood flow to the heart muscle. Risk factors include obesity, lack of physical ac-tivity, smoking, high cholesterol, hypertension, and old age. While the most common symptom of a heart attack is chest pain or discomfort, women are more likely than men to have symp-toms such as shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, and back or jaw pain. 19 Stroke is a type of cardiovascular disease that affects blood flow to the brain. Warning signs are sudden and can include facial, arm, or leg numbness, especially on one side of the body; severe headache; trouble walking; dizziness; a loss of balance or coordination; or trouble see-ing in one or both eyes. 19 In 2007, women were slightly less likely than men to have ever been told by a health profes-sional that they have heart disease (10.7 versus 11.9 percent, respectively). Among women, non-Hispanic Asians and Hispanics were least likely to be diagnosed with heart disease (5.1 and 6.9 percent, respectively). In 2006, there were nearly 2 million hospital discharges due to heart disease among women aged 18 years and older, resulting in a rate of 171.2 discharges per 10,000 women. Rates of hospital discharges due to heart disease increased with age: the rate among women aged 45 -64 years was 125.4 per 10,000, compared to 874.4 per 10,000 women aged 75 years and older. There is evidence that women diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or heart at-tack, are less likely than men with AMI to re-ceive certain treatments that have been reported to improve outcomes. 20 Research also suggests that physicians are less likely to counsel women about modifiable risk factors, such as diet and exercise, and that after a first heart attack, wom-en are less likely than men to receive cardiac rehabilitation, though the reasons for these sex disparities are unclear. 21 Percent of Adults Rate per 10,000 AdultsAdults Aged 18 and Older with Heart Disease,* by Race/Ethnicity and Sex, 2007 Source II.1: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for H ealth Statistics, Na tional H ealth I nterview Survey *First-listed of 393-398, 402, 404, 410-416, 420-429) .*Reported a health professional had ever told them they have a heart condition or heart disease. **IncludesNative Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, American Indian/Alaska Natives, persons of other races, persons of more than one race, and persons of unspecified race .Discharges Due to Heart Disease* from Non-Federal , Short-Stay Hospitals, by Age and Sex, 2006 Source II.11: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for He alth Statistics, Na tional H 18-44 Years Total14.113.2 220.2396.2598.6874.41,010.5 MaleFemale WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS 41 HiGH Blood PreSSUre High blood pressure is a risk factor for a number of conditions, including heart disease and stroke. It is defined as a systolic pressure (during heartbeats) of 140 or higher, and/or a diastolic pressure (between heartbeats) of 90 or higher. An examination of adults' blood pres-sure in 2005 -2006 showed that men had higher overall rates of high blood pressure than women (17.3 versus 16.0 percent, respectively). Rates of high blood pressure among women varied by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White women were most likely to have high blood pressure (19.9 and 16.3 percent, respectively), while Hispanic women were least likely (11.7 percent). The prevalence of high blood pressure among both men and women increases with age. Among women in 2003 -2006, those aged 65 years and older were most likely to have high blood pres-sure (47.4 percent), compared to 23.4 percent of women aged 45 -64 years. Women aged 20-44 years were least likely to have high blood pressure (3.1 percent). Antihypertensive drugs work to lower the body's blood pressure. The proportion of adults with high blood pressure who were not taking medication for the condition varied by sex, as well as race and ethnicity. In 2005 -2006, 62.6 percent of men and 42.4 percent of women found to have high blood pressure were not taking antihypertensive medication. Among women with high blood pressure, Hispanics were least likely to be taking medication: 64.4 percent reported not taking antihypertensive medication.

AIDS is diagnosed when HIV has weakened the immune system enough that the body has a difficult time fighting infec-tions. 22 While HIV and AIDS disproportion- ately affect men, a growing number of women are also affected; in 2006, there were an estimat-ed 11.9 new cases of HIV per 100,000 females aged 13 and older in the United States. Rates of HIV incidence vary by sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Among both males and females, rates of new HIV infections increase with age until age 40, then decrease. Among females, those aged 30 -39 years had the highest HIV incidence rate (22.8 per 100,000), followed by females aged 40 -49 and 13 -29 years (16.6 and 14.0 per 100,000, respectively). Women aged 50 years and older had the lowest HIV inci-dence rate in 2006 (3.5 per 100,000). Among females aged 13 and older, Black women had the highest incidence rates (55.7 per 100,000), followed by Hispanic and American Indian/Alaska Native women (14.4 and 12.8 per 100,000, respectively). While being of a particular race or ethnicity does not increase the likelihood of contracting HIV, certain challeng-es exist for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic fe-males putting them at greater risk for infection: socioeconomic factors such as limited access to quality health care; language and cultural barri-ers, particularly for Hispanics, which can affect the quality of health care; high rates of sexually transmitted infections, which increase the risk of HIV infection; and substance abuse. 23 In 2007, high-risk heterosexual contact (in- cluding sex with an injection drug user, sex with men who have sex with men, and sex with an HIV-infected person) accounted for 45.9 per-cent of new cases of HIV infection among ado-lescent and adult females, while injection drug use accounted for an additional 14.3 percent. In 39.2 percent of new cases, the transmission category was not reported or identified, and 0.5 percent of new cases were due to blood transfu-sions or receipt of blood components or tissue (data not shown).

Rates of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis are highest among adolescents and young adults. In 2007, there were 3,004.7 reported cases of chlamyd-ia and 647.9 reported cases of gonorrhea per 100,000 females aged 15 -19 years, compared to 28.5 and 12.1 reported cases per 100,000 women aged 45 -54 years, respectively. Syphilis was also more common among young women in 2007, occurring among 2.4, 3.5, and 2.6 per 100,000 females aged 15 -19, 20 -24, and 25-29 years, respectively (data not shown). Although chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis can be cured with appropriate antibiotics, left untreated they can have serious health conse-quences. Active infections can increase the like-lihood of contracting another STI, such as HIV, and untreated STIs can lead to pelvic inflamma-tory disease, infertility, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Some STIs cannot be cured with antibiotics but can only be treated to improve symptoms. Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2) is an un-treatable viral infection that can cause neonatal infections and increase risk for contracting HIV. HSV-2 is one of two viral infections that cause genital herpes. The prevalence of HSV-2 varies by age and sex. In 1999 -2004, females were more likely than males to have HSV-2 (22.8 versus 11.2 percent, respectively). This was true for every age category. Women aged 40 -49 years were most likely to have HSV-2 (33.9 percent), compared to 15.6 percent of females aged 20 - 29 and 2.3 percent of those aged 14 -19 years.

This can occur through educa-tion, engineering and design of safety products, enactment and enforcement of policies and laws, economic incentives, and improvements in emergency care. Some examples include the design, oversight, and use of child safety seats and seatbelts, workplace regulations regarding safety practices, and tax incentives for fitting home pools with fences. In 2007, unintentional falls were the leading cause of nonfatal injury among women of every age group, and rates generally increased with age. Women aged 65 years and older had the highest rate of injury due to unintentional falls (60.7 per 1,000 women), while fewer than 20 per 1,000 women aged 18 -34 and 35 -44 years experienced fall-related injuries. Unintentional injuries sustained as motor vehicle occupants were the second leading cause of injury among 18- to 34-year-olds (18.4 per 1,000 women), while unintentional overexertion was the sec-ond leading cause of injury among women of all other age groups; 13.7 per 1,000 women aged 35-44 years experienced injury due to overexer- tion, as did 9.8 per 1,000 women aged 45 -64, and 5.9 per 1,000 women aged 65 years and older. Unintentional and intentional injuries each represented a higher proportion of emergency department (ED) visits for men than women in 2006. Among women and men aged 18 years and older, unintentional injuries accounted for 18.7 and 25.1 percent of ED visits, respectively, while intentional injuries, or assault, represent-ed 1.7 and 3.0 percent of visits, respectively.

Of those injuries, more than 35 percent occurred among females aged 14 and older. While males account for the majority of total injuries, the distribution of injuries by age dif-fers between males and females. More than 35 percent of males with occupational injuries were aged 20 -34 years, compared to 29.7 percent of females in the same age group. In comparison, 16.2 percent of injuries among females occurred among women aged 55 years and older, while males of this age group accounted for 13.0 per-cent of injuries. The distribution of nonfatal occupational injuries by sex varies by occupational sector. In 2007, females accounted for 68.4 percent of in-juries occurring in management, professional, and related occupations, despite making up only 51.2 percent of the workforce in that sec-tor. Similarly, females represented 56.4 percent of the service workforce, but accounted for 61.1 percent of injuries in that sector. Conversely, males were somewhat overrepresented in injuries to sales and office workers: males made up 37.1 percent of that workforce, but accounted for 39.3 percent of the injuries. Injuries occurring among males and females in the farming, fish-ing, and forestry sector, as well as the construc-tion, extraction, and maintenance sector were approximately proportionate to their workforce representation.

IPV can take on many forms and vary in frequency and se-verity, ranging from threats of abuse to chronic, severe battering. IPV often is underreported, es-pecially with regard to sexual and psychological violence. According to the National Crime Victimiza- tion Survey, which collects data on victimiza-tion based on household and individual surveys, 5.7 per 1,000 women aged 18 and older were victims of nonfatal IPV in 2006. Additionally, between 1976 and 2005, 30.0 percent of homi-cides against females were committed by inti-mate partners. 24 Rates of IPV vary with a num- ber of factors including age, race and ethnicity, income, and marital status. Rates of women who report experiencing IPV decline with age. In 2006, women aged 18 -34 years were most likely to have reported experi-encing IPV (12.6 per 1,000 women), compared to 6.4 per 1,000 women aged 35 -44 years, and 2.0 per 1,000 women aged 45 -64 years. Similarly, reportes of IPV decline as an- nual household income increases. Women in households with incomes below $15,000 per year were most likely to have reported IPV (15.9 per 1,000 women), followed by women with incomes of $15,000-29,999 annually (8.6 per 1,000). Women with annual incomes of $50,000 or more were least likely to have re-ported IPV (2.8 per 1,000). Non-Hispanic White and Hispanic women were less likely to have reported IPV (5.0 and 5.6 per 1,000, respectively) than non-Hispanic Black women (7.4 per 1,000; data not shown). Human trafficking is another crime that disproportionately affects women and girls. In 2007 -2008, 1,229 alleged human trafficking incidents were reported by task forces in the United States, involving 1,442 victims. In cases where victims' characteristics were reported, women and girls accounted for 92.1 percent of victims. The proportion of sex trafficking vic-tims who were female was even greater: 98.9 percent (data not shown). 25Rate per 1,000 Women Rate per 1,000 WomenNonfatal Intimate Partner V iolence Among Wo men Aged 18 and Olde r,* by Age, 2006 Source II.19: U.S. Department of J ustice, Bu reau of J ustice S tatistics, N ational Crime Victimization Survey Nonfatal Intimate Partner V iolence Among Wo men Aged 18 and Olde r, by Annual Income, 2006 Source II.19: U.S. Department of J ustice, Bu reau of J ustice St atistics, Na Victimization $15,00051015202530 45-64 Years 35-44 Years 18-34 Years Total (18 Years and Older )2.0 *Due to the small sample size, the estimate for the 65 and older age group was not reliable .

More than 15 percent of women aged 45 -64 years experienced frequent depres- sion, compared to 12.8 percent of those aged 25-44 years and 9.6 percent of those aged 18 -24. Similarly, women aged 45 -64 years were more likely than women of other ages to experi-ence frequent anxiety (14.7 percent). Frequent depression and anxiety among women decrease as household income increases. In 2007, women with incomes of less than 100 percent of the poverty level were most likely to have experienced frequent depression or anxiety (25.1 and 22.4 percent, respectively), followed by women with incomes of 100 -199 percent of poverty (18.3 and 17.9 percent, respectively). Women with incomes of 400 percent or more of poverty were least likely to have reported ex-periencing frequent depression or anxiety in the past year (7.8 and 9.2 percent, respectively).Although most people who suffer from men- tal illness do not intentionally injure them-selves, mental illness is a major risk factor for self-inflicted injury. In 2003 -2005, 13.7 per 10,000 emergency department (ED) visits were for self-inflicted injuries. The rate of emergency department visits due to self-inflicted injury was higher for females than males (16.2 versus 11.3 per 10,000 ED visits, respectively; data not shown). 27 Research suggests that women suffering from chronic diseases such as heart disease may be more likely than men to suffer major depres-sion, increasing the risk of mortality and mor-bidity. 28 Frequent Depression and Anxiety* Within the Past Year Among Wo men Aged 18 and Olde r, by Poverty Status,** 2007 Source II.1: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for He alth Statistics, Na tional H ealth I nterview SurveyFrequent Depression and Anxiety* Within the Past Year Among Wo men Aged 18 and Olde r, by Age, 2007 Source II.1: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for He alth Statistics, Na tional H ealth I nterview Survey Percent of Women *Reported they had been frequently depressed or anxious during the past 12 months.**Poverty level, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, was $21,027 for a family of four in 2007. *Reported they had been frequently depressed or anxious during the past 12 months .51015202530 65 Years and Older45-64 Years 25-44 Years 18-24 Years 400% Poverty200-399% of Poverty100-199% 9.610.312.8 14.7 13.111.8AnxietyDepression 25.1 22.4 18.3 17.9 13.7 13.1 7.89.2AnxietyDepression WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 HEALTH STATUS - HEALTH INDICATORS 48 orAl He AltH Oral health conditions can cause chronic pain of the mouth and face and can impair the ability to eat normally. Regular dental care is particularly important for women because there is some evidence of an association between periodontal disease and certain birth outcomes, such as increased risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. 29 To prevent caries (tooth decay) and periodontal (gum) disease, the American Dental Association recommends maintaining a healthy diet with plenty of water, and limiting eating and drinking between meals. 30 In 2005 -2006, 39.7 percent of women re- ported that their teeth were in excellent or very good condition. This varied, however, by pover-ty status; nearly half of women with household incomes below 100 percent of the poverty level reported their teeth to be in fair or poor condi-tion, while fewer than one-quarter reported ex-cellent or very good oral health. In comparison, nearly half of women with incomes of 300 per-cent or more of poverty reported that their teeth were in excellent or very good condition. Dental restoration is used to treat cavities caused by caries. In 2005 -2006, 82.7 percent of women had had at least one tooth restored, while 19.1 percent of women had untreated tooth decay. Prevalence of dental restoration and un-treated tooth decay among women varied with age. Women aged 45 -64 years were most likely to have had at least one tooth restored (89.5 per-cent), compared to 87.3 percent of women aged 25-44 years and 72.0 percent of women aged 18-24 years. Women aged 25 -44 years were more likely than women of other ages to have untreated tooth decay (22.8 percent), followed by women aged 18 -24 years (21.0 percent). Since many physical injuries resulting from intimate partner violence (IPV) involve the head, neck, and mouth, dental professionals have a unique opportunity to assess, educate, and refer women experiencing or at risk of IPV to appropriate services. Physical symptoms of IPV that may be observed during a dental visit include trauma in the head and neck region, multiple or old injuries, and untreated rampant caries. 31 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100300% or More of Poverty200-299% of Poverty100-199% of PovertyLess Than 100% of Poverty Total *Poverty level, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, was $20,444 for a family of four in 2006.

In 2005 -2006, an estimated 10.5 million Americans over the age of 20 had os-teoporosis, 84 percent of whom were women. Among adults aged 20 years and older, 8.1 percent of women and 1.7 percent of men re-ported having ever been told by a health profes-sional that they have osteoporosis. The rate of osteoporosis among women varied significantly with race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic White women were most likely to have osteoporosis (9.9 percent), compared to non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women (3.2 and 3.5 percent, respectively). Each year more than 1.5 million people suffer a bone fracture related to osteoporosis, with the most common breaks in the wrist, spine, and hip. Fractures can have devastating consequenc-es. For example, hip fractures are associated with an increased risk of mortality, and nearly 1 in 5 hip fracture patients is admitted to a nurs-ing home within a year. 32 In 2006, there were 237,000 hospital discharges due to hip fractures among women aged 18 and older, a rate of 20.5 per 10,000 women. Rates of hospital discharges due to hip fractures were highest among women aged 75 years and older (169.9 discharges per 10,000 women), followed by women aged 65-74 years (28.3 per 10,000 women). Osteoporosis may be prevented and treated by getting the recommended amounts of calcium, vitamin D, and regular weight-bearing physical activity (i.e. walking), and by taking prescrip-tion medication when appropriate. Bone den-sity tests are recommended for women over 65 years and for any man or woman who suffers a fracture after age 50. T reatment for osteoporosis has been shown to reduce the risk of subsequent fractures by 30-65 percent. 32 Among women who had been told by a health professional that they have osteoporosis, 76.1 percent reported having been treated for the condition (data not shown).

Symptoms of severe headache include intense pain, usually on both sides of the head. Migraine, in addition to severe pain on only one side of the head, may be accompanied by neurological symptoms such as distorted vision, nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light or sound. In 2007, 12.3 percent of adults reported experiencing a severe headache or migraine in the past 3 months (data not shown). Severe headaches and migraines are more than twice as common among women as men (16.8 versus 7.4 percent, respectively). For both sexes, the rate of severe headaches and migraines is high-est among those aged 25 -44 years and decreases with age. Among women aged 65 years and older, only 5.9 percent reported severe headaches or migraines in the past 3 months, compared to 22.4 percent of women aged 25 -44 years. The percentage of women experiencing severe headaches and migraines decreases as household income increases. In 2007, 24.1 per-cent of women with household incomes below 100 percent of poverty reported experiencing a severe headache or migraine in the past 3 months, compared to 17.9 percent of women with household incomes of 200 -399 percent of poverty and 14.8 percent of women with incomes of 400 percent or more of poverty.

Some ex- amples include urinary incontinence, urinary tract infection, sexually transmitted diseases, urolithiasis (kidney stones), and kidney and bladder cancer. Many of these disorders affect a large number of adult women; annual Med-icaid expenditures for urinary incontinence and urinary tract infections among adult women total more than $234 million and $956 million, respectively.

In addition, 21.6 percent of women with urinary leakage reported that it affects their daily activi-ties at least a little, compared to 14.5 percent of men (data not shown). Among women with urinary leakage, 38.7 percent reported that it occurred less than once a month, while 28.3 percent reported occurrence a few times a month. Nearly 16 percent of those with urinary leakage reported that it occurred a few times a week and 17.2 percent experienced leakage every day and/or night. Urinary incontinence also varied by race and ethnicity. More than 40 percent of non-Hispanic White women reported urinary leakage, followed by 36.6 percent of Hispanic women. Non-Hispanic Black women were least likely to report any leakage (29.4 percent; data not shown). Among women with urinary leakage, the frequency of occurrence and ef-fects on daily activities did not vary by race and ethnicity, indicating that the impact of the condition is universal. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 HEALTH STATUS - MATERNAL HEALTH 52 liVe BirtHS According to preliminary data, there were more than 4.3 million live births in the United States in 2007, an increase of 1 percent from the previous year. The number of births rose in every racial and ethnic group, most noticeably among Asian/Pacific Islander women (6 percent). Over-all, the crude birth rate was 14.3 births per 1,000 total population (data not shown). Hispanic women continued to have the highest birth rate in 2007 (102.1 per 1,000 women), followed by non-Hispanic Black women (71.6 per 1,000 women). Non-Hispanic White women had the lowest birth rate (60.1 per 1,000 women). With regard to age, overall birth rates were highest among mothers aged 25 -29 years (117.5 live births per 1,000 women), followed by those aged 20 -24 years (106.4 births per 1,000 wom- en). The birth rate for non-Hispanic Whites was highest among 25- to 29-year-olds (108.8 per 1,000), while the rates for non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indian/Alaska Natives were highest among 20- to 24-year-olds (133.6, 178.5, and 116.3 per 1,000 women, respective-ly). The birth rate among Asian/Pacific Islanders was highest among 30- to 34-year-olds (125.1 per 1,000 women). The percentage of births delivered by cesar- ean has steadily increased since 1996. Among all births in 2006 (the latest year for which data are available), nearly one-third (31.1 percent) were delivered by cesarean, a 50 percent increase since 1996. Additionally, induction of labor in-creased more than 130 percent since 1990, from 9.6 percent in 1990 to 22.5 percent in 2006. In contrast, rates of vaginal births after a previous cesarean (VBAC) continued to decrease from 2005 to 2006 (from 7.9 to 7.6 percent; data not shown). 34 In 2006, 83.2 percent of women received prenatal care during the first trimester of preg-nancy, while 3.6 percent of women received care in the third trimester or not at all (data not shown). 34 *Data are preliminar Involving Section and Induction of Labor Among Wo men, 1990-2006 Source II.21, 22: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health St atistics, Na tional Vital S tatistics S ystemLive Births per 1,000 Wo men, by Age and Race/Ethnicity , 2007 * Source II.20: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for He alth Statistics, Na tional Vital S tatistics S ystem Years 47.5 45.8 36.4 56.4 29.4 40-44 Years 9.5 8.6 8.6 13.4 6.1 14.522.531.1 510152025303540 2006 2004 2002 2000 1998 1996 1994 1992 1990Cesarean Section Induction of Labor WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 HEALTH STATUS - MATERNAL HEALTH 53 BreAStfeedinG Breastmilk benefits the health, growth, im- munity, and development of infants, and moth- ers who breastfeed may have a decreased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. 35 The Healthy People 2010 objectives for breastfeeding are to increase the percentage of women ever breastfeeding to 75 percent and those breastfeeding at 6 months to 50 percent. 36 Among infants born in 2005, 74.2 percent were reported to have ever been breastfed, representing a significant increase over the 68.3 percent of children ever breast-fed in 1999. Other estimates of breastfeeding initiation yield percentages that exceed the HP 2010 goal. 37 Non-Hispanic Black infants were the least likely to ever be breastfed (58.7 per-cent), while Asian/Pacific Islanders and Hispan-ics were the most likely (83.6 and 80.6 percent, respectively). The American Academy of Pediatrics recom- mends that infants be exclusively breastfed\u2014 without supplemental solids or liquids\u2014for the first 6 months of life; however, 11.9 percent of infants born in 2005 were exclusively breastfed through 6 months, and 43.1 percent of infants were fed any breastmilk at 6 months. Breastfeed-ing practices vary considerably by a number of factors, including educational attainment\u2014in-fants born to college graduates were most likely to have ever been breastfed (85.9 percent), while infants born to mothers with no high school di-ploma were least likely (65.7 percent). Maternal employment can also affect whether and for how long an infant is breastfed; mothers working full-time are less likely to breastfeed at 6 months than those working part-time or not at all. 38 In 2006, 51.9 percent of mothers with children under 1 year of age were employed, and nearly 70 percent of those mothers were employed full-time (data not shown). 39 Infants * Who Are Breastfed, by Race/Ethnicity and Duration, 2005-2007 Source II.23: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National I mmunization Su rveyInfants * Who Are Breastfed, by Maternal Education and Duration, 2005-2007 Source II.23: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National I Su rvey Percent of Infants74.2 11.943.174.5 at 6 Months 65.7 37.1 20.4Exclusively at 6 Months Percent of Infants *Includes only infants born in 2005; data are provisional. **Reported that child was ever breastfed or fed human breastmilk.

As of 2006, the 1989 Standard Certificate of Live Birth (unrevised) was used in 32 States, New York City, and Washington, DC, while 19 States used the revised birth certificate. 40The areas using the revised birth certificate reported higher rates of smoking in pregnancy than those using the unrevised certificate (13.1 versus 9.9 percent, respectively). The propor-tion of mothers who smoked varied by mater-nal race and ethnicity. Among women in areas using the revised birth certificate, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native mothers (27.4 percent) and non-Hispanic White mothers (18.0 percent) were most likely to report having smoked during pregnancy. Similarly, among women in the unrevised re- porting areas, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native mothers were most likely to have smoked during pregnancy (16.9 percent), fol-lowed by non-Hispanic White women (13.2 percent). Non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic mothers were least likely to have smoked during pregnancy in both reporting areas. Cigarette use also varied by maternal age in 2006. Among women in the revised reporting areas, women under 20 years of age were most likely to have smoked cigarettes during preg-nancy (17.3 percent), followed by women aged 20-29 years (15.9 percent).

Diabetes, both chronic and gestational (developing only dur-ing pregnancy), may pose health risks to both a woman and her baby. Women with gestational diabetes are at increased risk for developing dia-betes later in life. 41 In 2006, diabetes of any type during pregnancy occurred at a rate of 42.3 per 1,000 live births. This varied by race/ethnic-ity; Hispanic mothers were more likely to have had diabetes (43.0 per 1,000 live births) than non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks (40.1 and 37.1 per 1,000, respectively).Hypertension during pregnancy can also be either chronic in nature or gestational. Severe hypertension during pregnancy can result in preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, prema-ture birth, placental abruption, and stillbirth. 42 Chronic hypertension was present in 10.8 per 1,000 live births in 2006, and most common among non-Hispanic Black women (21.0 per 1,000). The rate of pregnancy-associated hyper-tension was 39.1 per 1,000 live births and was more common among non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White women (46.1 and 43.8 per 1,000 births) than among Hispanic women (28.0 per 1,000). Eclampsia, which involves seizures and is usually preceded by a diagnosis of preeclampsia, is a life-threatening complication of pregnancy. In 2006, eclampsia occurred among 2.5 women per 1,000 live births. Rates of maternal morbidities and risk factors also varied by maternal age. In 2006, women aged 40 -54 years were at highest risk of diabetes during pregnancy (94.3 per 1,000 live births), pregnancy-associated hypertension (50.5 per 1,000) and chronic hypertension (30.4 per 1,000). Women under 20 years of age were least likely to have diabetes during pregnancy or chronic hypertension (13.3 and 3.9 per 1,000, respectively). Rates of pregnancy-associated hy-pertension did not vary significantly between age groups for women under 40 years of age.

The maternal mortality rate has declined dramatically since 1950 when the rate was 83.3 deaths per 100,000 live births; howev-er, the maternal mortality rate in 2006 (13.3 per 100,000 live births) was 62 percent higher than the rate reported in 1990 (8.2 per 100,000). According to the National Center for Health Statistics, this increase may largely be due to changes in how pregnancy status is recorded on death certificates; beginning in 1999, the cause of death was coded according to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). Other methodological changes in reporting and data processing have been responsible for apparent increases in more recent years, includ-ing question formatting and revisions to the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death. 43 In 2006, there were a total of 569 maternal deaths. This does not include 191 deaths of women that were due to complications during pregnancy or childbirth and that occurred after 42 days postpartum or the deaths of pregnant women due to external causes such as uninten-tional injury, homicide, or suicide. In 2006, the maternal mortality rate among non-Hispanic Black women (34.8 per 100,000 live births) was more than 3 times the rates among non-Hispanic White and Hispanic women (9.1 and 10.2 per 100,000, respectively). The risk of maternal death increases with age for women of all races and ethnicities. In 2006, the maternal mortality rate was highest among women aged 35 years and older (29.3 per 100,000 live births), compared to 5.0 per 100,000 live births to women under 20 years of age and 10.2 per 100,000 live births among women aged 20 -24 years.

In 2007, older women com-posed 7.3 percent of the total population while men accounted for 5.3 percent. Women rep-resented a larger proportion of the population than men within every older age group. Among women aged 65 years and older and not living in an institution, 42.2 percent were married and living with a spouse in 2007, while another 38.6 percent lived alone. Nearly 9 per-cent of older women were heads of their house-hold, with no spouse present, meaning that they have children or other family members, but no spouse, living with them in a housing unit that they own or rent. Research has suggested that older adults who live alone are more likely to live in poverty, which has numerous implica-tions including increased risk of food insecurity, decreased access to health care facilities due to lack of transportation, and inability to pay util-ity bills. 44 Employment plays a significant role in the lives of many older Americans. In 2007, more than 2.4 million women aged 65 years and old-er were working, accounting for 10.8 percent of women in this age group. Nearly 19 percent of women aged 65 -74 years were employed dur- ing 2007, while only 3.5 percent of those aged 75 and older were employed (data not shown). In 2004, an estimated 1.5 million adults re- sided in nursing homes. Women aged 65 years and older accounted for 65.7 percent of the nursing home resident population. Some nurs-ing home facilities offer end-of-life or palliative care for their residents; in 2004, 17.2 percent of facilities reported participating in at least one end-of-life program, while 16.7 percent also re-ported having trained staff for providing pallia-tive and end-of-life care (data not shown). 45 Percent of PopulationRepresentation of Adults Aged 65 and Older in the U.S. Population, * by Age and Sex, 2007 Source I.1: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community SurveyWomen Aged 65 and Olde r,* by Household Composition , 2007 Source I.2: U.S. Census Bureau, C urrent P opulation Su rvey 65-74 Years TotalFemaleMaleTotal Head of Household, No Spous e Present 8.9% Living Alone 38.6% Living With Non-Relatives Present 42.2%5.3 7.33.0 3.51.8 2.60.6 1.2 WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 HEALTH STATUS - SPECIAL POPULATIONS 58 rUrAl And UrBAn WoMen In 2006, more than 48 million people, or 16.4 percent of the population, lived in areas considered to be non-metropolitan. The num-ber of areas defined as metropolitan changes frequently as the population grows and people move. Residents of non-metropolitan areas tend to be older, complete fewer years of education, have public insurance or no health insurance, and live farther from health care resources than their metropolitan counterparts. In 2006, 22.4 percent of women in non- metropolitan areas were aged 65 years and older, while only 17.3 percent of women in metropoli-tan areas were in the same age group. One-quar-ter of women in non-metropolitan areas were aged 18 -34 years, compared to 30.0 percent in metropolitan areas. Women aged 35 -44 years and 45-64 years accounted for approximately the same percentage of the female population in non-metropolitan and metropolitan areas. Nearly 66 percent of women reported receiv- ing dental care once a year or more frequently in 2006. Annual dental care was more common among women of all ages in metropolitan ar-eas than in non-metropolitan areas (67.3 ver-sus 57.7 percent, respectively). Among women in non-metropolitan areas, those aged 35 -44 years were most likely to receive dental care at least once a year (64.2 percent), followed by women aged 18 -34 and 45 -64 years (59.1 and 59.7 percent, respectively). Fewer than half of non-metropolitan women aged 65 years and older reported receiving dental care at least once a year. 57.7Women Aged 18 and Olde r, by Area of Residence and Age, 2006 Source II.26: U.S. Agency for H ealthcare R esearch and Quality , Medical Expenditure Panel Su rveyWomen Aged 18 and Older Who Receive Dental Care Once a Year or More, by Age and Area of Residence, 2006 Source II.26: U.S. Agency for H ealthcare R esearch and Quality , Medical Expenditure Panel Su rvey *A metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is defined as a core area containing a large population nucleus together with adjacent communities having a high degree of economic and social integration with that core.

WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 63 HeAltH Ser ViceS UtilizA tion Availability of and access to quality health care services directly affects all aspects of wom- en's health. For women who have poor health status, disabilities, poverty, lack of insurance, and limited access to a range of health services, preventive treatment and rehabilitation can be critical in preventing disease and improving quality of life. This section presents data on women's health services utilization, including data on women's insurance coverage, usual source of care, satisfac-tion with care, and use of various services, such as preventive care, HIV testing, hospitalization, and mental health services. A new addition to this section describes the use of alternative and complementary medicine among women. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION 64 USUAl SoUrce of cAre Women who have a usual source of care (a place they usually go when they are sick) are more likely to receive preventive care,1 to have access to care (as indicated by use of a physician or emergency department, or not delaying seek-ing care when needed), 2 to receive continuous care, and to have lower rates of hospitalization and lower health care costs. 3 In 2007, 89.2 per- cent of women reported having a usual source of care. Within every racial and ethnic group, women were more likely than men to have a usual source of care. Non-Hispanic White women were most likely to report a usual source of care (91.1 percent), followed by non-His-panic women of other races not specified (89.1 percent) and non-Hispanic Black women (88.8 percent). Among both women and men, His-panics were least likely to report a usual source of care (79.9 and 62.7 percent, respectively). In 2007, the percentage of women with a usual source of care varied by geographic region and poverty level. Among women with house-hold incomes of 200 percent or more of the poverty level, there was little variation in hav-ing a usual source of care by geographic region. Among women with lower incomes, however, having a usual source of care varied noticeably by geographic region. Among women with in-comes of less than 200 percent of poverty, those in the South and West were least likely to have a usual source of care (77.0 and 81.7 percent, respectively), while those in the Northeast were most likely to have a usual source of care (90.8 percent).Percent of WomenWomen Aged 18 and Older with a Usual Source of Care, by Geographic Region and Poverty Status, * 2007 Source II.1: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, N ational Center for He alth Statistics, Na tional H ealth I nterview SurveyPercent of AdultsAdults Aged 18 and Older with a Usual Source of Care, by Race/Ethnicity and Sex, 2007 * Source II.1: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for H ealth Statistics, Na tional H ealth I nterview Survey *Rates are not age-adjusted. **Includes Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, American Indian/Alaska Natives, persons of other races, persons of more than one race, and persons of unspecified race the U.S. Census Bureau, was $21,027 for a family of four in 2007.

Complementary interventions are used together with conventional treatments, while alternative interventions are used in place of those treatments. Both can be used to im-prove health and well-being, to relieve symp-toms associated with illness, and to relieve side effects from conventional treatments. In 2007, 63.8 percent of women reported having ever prayed for their own health. The second most commonly reported CAM therapy was the use of herbal supplements (27.2 per-cent), followed by chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation (24.2 percent) and massage (20.0 percent). Use of CAM therapies varied by race and ethnicity: non-Hispanic Black women were more likely than women of other races to have ever prayed for their own health (80.5 percent), while non-Hispanic White women were the most likely to utilize massage (23.7 percent), deep breathing (21.8 percent), and homeopath-ic treatment (5.3 percent).

In 2007, 37.5 million adults (16.7 percent) were uninsured. Adults aged 18-64 accounted for 36.8 million of those unin-sured, representing 19.6 percent of that popula-tion (data not shown). 4 The percentage of people who are uninsured varies considerably across a number of categories, including age, sex, race and ethnicity, income, and education. Among adults in 2007, those aged 18 -24 years were most likely to lack health insurance. Men were more likely than women to be un-insured in every age group. The highest rate of uninsurance occurred among 18- to 24-year-old men (30.1 percent), which was substantially higher than the percentage for women of the same age group (26.2 percent). The lowest rate of uninsurance was among adults aged 65 and older, most of whom are eligible for Medicare coverage. The next lowest percentage of unin-sured occurred among women and men aged 45-64 (13.3 and 14.6 percent, respectively); the sex disparity in this age group was less pro-nounced than in the younger age groups. Among women aged 18-64 in 2007, 71.5 percent had private insurance, 15.0 percent had public insurance, and 17.6 percent were uninsured. This distribution varied by race and ethnicity: non-Hispanic White females had the highest rate of private insurance coverage (78.9 percent), followed by Asian/Pacific Islander women (72.6 percent). American Indian/Alaska Native females had the highest rate of public in-surance coverage (23.9 percent) followed closely by non-Hispanic Black women (23.3 percent). Hispanic females had the highest rate of unin-surance (36.6 percent), followed by American Indian/Alaska Native women (30.7 percent).

Medicare has four components: Part A covers hospital, skilled nursing, home health, and hospice care; Part B covers physician ser-vices, outpatient services, and durable medical equipment; Part C (Medicare Advantage Plans) allows beneficiaries to purchase additional in-surance coverage through private insurers; and Part D allows coverage for prescription drugs through private insurers. In 2007, 60.2 percent of Medicare's 44.3 mil- lion enrollees were female. Among both women and men, those in older age groups accounted for a greater proportion of overall enrollment; however, men were more likely to have greater representation than women in the younger age groups. For instance, 8.5 percent of male en-rollees were aged 55-64 years, compared to 6.2 percent of female enrollees. Similarly, adults aged 65-74 years accounted for 45.2 percent of male enrollees, compared to 41.4 percent of female enrollees. In contrast, adults aged 75 years and older accounted for 44.7 percent of female enrollees, compared to 35.0 percent of male enrollees. Medicaid, jointly funded by Federal and State governments, provides coverage for low-income people and people with disabilities. In 2006, Medicaid covered 59.4 million people in-cluding children; the aged, blind, and disabled; and adults who are eligible for cash assistance programs. Adults aged 19 and older accounted for nearly half of Medicaid enrollees (29.4 mil-lion), and women accounted for 69.4 percent of adult enrollees. Women accounted for a greater proportion of adult Medicaid enrollees than men in every age group, most noticeably among 21- to 44-year-olds and those aged 85 years and older (74.3 and 80.4 percent, respectively). 65-74 Years 45.2% Percent of Population *Enrolled as of July 1, 2007.Male FemaleMedicare Enrollees,* by Sex and Age, 2007 Source III.1: Centers for M edicare and M edicaid Se rvices Adult Medicaid Enrollees Aged 19 and Olde r, by Age and Sex, 2007 Source III.1: Centers for M edicare and M edicaid Years 41.4%Under 75-84 Years 26.8% 65-74 Years 45.2%55-64 Years 8.5% WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION 68 PreVentiVe cAre Preventive health care, including counseling, education, and screening can help prevent or minimize the effects of many serious health con-ditions. In 2006, females of all ages made 533 million physician office visits. Of these visits, 21.5 percent were for preventive care, including prenatal care, health screening, and insurance examinations (data not shown). 5 Routine Pap smears, which detect the early signs of cervical cancer, are recommended at least every 3 years beginning within 3 years of initiation of sexual activity, or by age 21. 6 In 2006, 6.6 percent of physician office visits made by women aged 18 and older included a Pap smear. This rate was higher among younger women and decreased with age, most likely due to higher rates of physician office visits among older women for non-preventive care. Among women aged 18 -24 years, 10.5 percent of phy- sician visits included a Pap smear, compared to 7.0 percent of visits made by women aged 45 - 64 years and 2.0 percent of visits among those aged 65 years and older. Among women aged 40 and older, 4.7 per- cent of physician visits included a mammogram, which is recommended every 1 -2 years to screen for breast cancer among this age group. 6 The rate of office visits including a mammogram was highest among the younger age groups. Among women aged 40 -49 years, 6.2 percent of visits included a mammogram, compared to 3.0 per-cent of visits made by women aged 70 years and older. High cholesterol is a risk factor for heart disease. The Healthy People 2010 goal is to in-crease the percentage of adults aged 20 and over who receive a cholesterol screening at least ev-ery 5 years to 80 percent. 7 In 2005 -2006, 72.1 percent of women aged 20 years and older had received a cholesterol test within the previous 5 years.

Vaccination for influenza is recom- mended for young children 6 months through 18 years of age, adults aged 50 years and older, pregnant women or women who will be preg-nant during flu season, persons with certain chronic medical conditions, persons in long-term care facilities, and health care workers and other persons in close contact with those at high risk. 8 In 2007, 44.8 percent of women aged 55 -64 years and 66.3 percent of women aged 65 years and older reported receiving a flu vaccine in the past year; this varied, however, by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic White wom-en were more likely than women of other races and ethnicities to have received the flu vaccine: WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION 69 47.0 percent of 55- to 64-year-olds and 68.4 percent of those aged 65 years and older did so. Fewer than 57 percent of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women aged 65 years and older received the flu vaccine. Pneumonia (pneumococcal) vaccine is rec- ommended for adults aged 65 years and older and for people with certain health conditions. In 2007, 60.4 percent of women aged 65 and older reported ever receiving the vaccine. In this age group, 65.1 percent of non-Hispanic White women had ever received the pneumonia vac-cine, compared to 45.4 percent of non-Hispan-ic Black women and 36.4 percent of Hispanic women. Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended to re- duce the spread of hepatitis B, which may result in cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer, liver fail-ure, and even death. 9 Hepatitis B vaccination also varied by race and ethnicity, as well as age. Younger women were most likely to have re-ceived at least one of the three recommended doses, and non-Hispanic White and non-His-panic Black women in every age group were more likely than Hispanic women to have re-ceived the vaccine. Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause cervical cancer and other diseases in women. In 2006, the HPV vaccine was rec-ommended for adolescent females and young women aged 9-26 years. 10 In 2006 -2007, 10 percent of women aged 18 -26 had been vac- cinated for HPV (data not shown).11 Receipt of Selected V accinations * Among Wo men Aged 18 and Olde r, by Race/Ethnicity ** and Selected Age Group, 2007 Source II.1: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for H ealth St atistics, Na tional He alth In Percent of Women 21.844.866.3 23.9 *Having received the flu vaccine in the past 12 months; having ever received the pneumonia vaccine; and having ever received at least one dose of the three-dose hepatitis B vaccine. **Sample of Asian/Pacific Islanders, American Indian/Alaska Natives, persons of other races, persons of more than one race, and persons of all other and unspecified races was too small to produce reliable results.

Among women, one-third of expenses were covered by either Medicare or Medicaid, while 41.8 percent of expenses were covered by private insurance. Although the percentage of expenditures paid through private insurance was similar for both sexes, health care costs of women were more likely than those of men to be paid by Medicaid (8.1 versus 5.7 percent, respectively). In 2006, 90.5 percent of women had at least one health care expenditure, compared to 77.9 percent of men (data not shown). Among those who had at least one health care expense, the average expenditure per person, including expenses covered by insurance and those paid out-of-pocket, was higher for women ($5,219) than for men ($4,546). However, men's aver-age expenditures exceeded women's for hospital inpatient services ($17,531 versus $13,104, re-spectively), hospital outpatient services ($2,369 versus $1,871), and home health services ($5,450 versus $5,286). Women's expenditures exceeded men's in the categories of office-based medical services ($1,426 versus $1,253, respec-tively) and dental services ($622 versus $595). Despite women's mean health care expenses by category generally being lower than men's, the overall mean health care expense was greater for women because of the greater percentage of women incurring more expensive services. For instance, more women had hospital inpatient services than men, which contributes to a high-er mean expenditure overall. Overall per capita health care expenditures have increased substantially in the past decade for both men and women. In 2006, the annual mean health care expenses for both men and women were nearly 59 percent higher than in 1999 (data not shown).

Nearly 20 percent of hospital stays for all fe-males were due to childbirth, while 14.6 per-cent were due to diseases of the circulatory sys-tem. Other common reasons for hospitalization included diseases of the respiratory, digestive, and genitourinary systems; injury and poison-ing; and mental disorders. Overall, females had a higher hospital discharge rate than males in 2006 (1,375.3 versus 954.9 per 10,000 popula-tion; data not shown). The types of procedures conducted during short hospital stays also vary by sex. Overall procedure rates were 1,811.5 procedures per 10,000 females (this includes 466.4 obstetri-cal procedures per 10,000 females) and 1,261.5 procedures per 10,000 males. Several of the pro-cedures more common among females included operations on the digestive system (207.0 per 10,000 females versus 166.0 per 10,000 males) and operations on the genital organs, including hysterectomy for women (129.0 versus 17.1 per 10,000, respectively). Males had a higher rate than females for operations on the cardiovas-cular system (280.9 versus 205.6 per 10,000, respectively). Among females, the highest rate of procedures for discharges from short-stay hospitals was obstetrical procedures (466.4 per 10,000).

It is recommend-ed that people who meet any of the following criteria be tested at least annually for HIV: those who have injected drugs or steroids, or shared drug use equipment (such as needles); have had unprotected sex with men who have sex with men, anonymous partners, or multiple partners; have exchanged sex for drugs or money; have been diagnosed with hepatitis, tuberculosis, or a sexually transmitted infection; received a blood transfusion between 1978 and 1985; or have had unprotected sex with anyone who meets any of these criteria. 12 In addition, the CDC recommends that all pregnant women be tested for HIV during their pregnancy. In 2006, CDC guidelines recommended that all health care providers include HIV testing as part of their patients' routine health care. In 2007, nearly 37 percent of adults in the United States had ever been tested for HIV. Overall, women were slightly more likely than men to have been tested (38.8 versus 34.3 per-cent, respectively). Within younger age groups (18-44 years), women were more likely to have been tested than men, while men were more likely to have been tested at older ages (45 years and older). Among women in 2007, non-Hispanic Blacks were most likely to have ever been test-ed (55.5 percent), while non-Hispanic White women were least likely (33.9 percent). Of women who had not been tested, 78.0 percent reported that they had not been tested because they thought it was unlikely they had been exposed and 19.9 percent reported that there was no particular reason they had not done so (data not shown).Percent of Adults Percent of WomenAdults Aged 18 and Older Who Have Ever Been T ested for HIV, by Age and Sex, 2007 Source II.1: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for H ealth Statistics, Na tional H ealth I nterview SurveyWomen Aged 18 and Older Who Have Ever Been T ested for HIV, by Race/Ethnicity, 2007 * Source II.1: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, N ational Center for He alth Statistics, Na Years 25-34 18-24 Years Total *Rates are not age-adjusted. **Includes Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, American Indian/Alaska Natives, persons of other races, persons of more than one race, and persons of unspecified race . WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION 73 Ment Al He AltH cAre UtilizA tion In 2007, more than 29 million adults in the United States reported receiving mental health treatment in the past year. Women represented two-thirds of users of mental health services, in-cluding inpatient and outpatient care and pre-scription medications. Nearly 17 million wom-en reported using prescription medication for treatment of a mental or emotional condition, representing 14.5 percent of women aged 18 and older, almost twice the rate among men (7.5 percent). Outpatient treatment was reported by 9.0 percent of women, and inpatient treatment was reported by 0.9 percent of women.In 2007, mental health services were needed, but not received, by an estimated 11 million adults in the United States. Nearly 7 percent of women and 3.1 percent of men reported an un-met need for mental health treatment or coun-seling in the past year. Cost or lack of adequate insurance coverage was the most commonly re-ported reason for not receiving needed services, reported by 50.7 percent of women and 47.5 percent of men with unmet mental health treat-ment needs. The next most commonly reported reasons among women were feeling that they could handle their problems without treatment (29.5 percent) and fear of stigma, including concerns about confidentiality or the opinions of others, or the potential effect on employment (21.5 percent). Not knowing where to go for services prevented 13.6 percent of women from receiving needed treatment. Among women, unmet need for treatment varied by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic women of multiple races were most likely to report an unmet need for treatment (13.9 per-cent), followed by non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women (7.4 and 6.6 percent, respectively). Ad-ditionally, 5.9 percent of non-Hispanic Black women and 5.2 percent of Hispanic women had an unmet need for treatment. Non-His-panic Asian/Pacific Islander women were least likely to report an unmet need for mental health treatment (3.2 percent; data not shown).

Indicators used to monitor women's health care in man-aged care plans include screening for chlamyd-ia, screening for cervical cancer, and receipt of mammograms. Despite a slight decline in chlamydia screen- ings for women aged 21 -25 years enrolled in Medicaid from 2006 to 2007, females with Medicaid coverage were more likely to have re-ceived a chlamydia screening than those with private coverage (54.2 versus 39.2 percent, re-spectively). Since 2000, the percentage of sexu-ally active females screened for chlamydia has increased by 89 percent among those in com-mercial plans and 43 percent among Medicaid participants. In 2007, receipt of mammograms for women aged 40 -69 years was approximately the same for women with private coverage and those covered through Medicare (69.1 and 67.3 per-cent, respectively). However, women enrolled in Medicaid were considerably less likely to have received a mammogram at least once during the previous 2 years (49.9 percent). Cervical cancer screenings appear to be more accessible to women with commercial coverage than to those covered by Medicaid. Among women aged 21 -64 years, cervical cancer screenings were received at least once during the previous 3 years by 81.7 percent of commercially-insured women and 64.7 percent of those covered by Medicaid.

In 2007, 32.8 percent of women were not satisfied with their experiences related to their health plan's customer service, including re-ceiving needed information or help and being treated with courtesy and respect. This varied by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic Asian women were most likely to be dissatisfied (45.4 per-cent), while non-Hispanic White women were least likely (31.8 percent). About one-third of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women were dissatisfied with their experiences related to their health plans. Satisfaction with how well doctors commu- nicate varies by education level; women with higher levels of education are more likely to be satisfied. In 2007, women who had at least a 4-year college degree were most likely to be satisfied with how well their doctors commu-nicate (84.7 percent), followed closely by those completing at least some college (83.2 percent). In contrast, fewer than three-quarters of women with less than a high school diploma were satis-fied with communications with their doctors. More than 24 percent of women were not satisfied with their experiences in getting the care they needed when they needed it, includ-ing seeing specialists and getting necessary care, tests, or treatment. The percentage of women reporting dissatisfaction was greatest among non-Hispanic Asian women (32.4 percent). More than 29 percent of Hispanic women, 28.9 percent of non-Hispanic Black and 22.3 per-cent of non-Hispanic White women were also not satisfied with getting the care they needed (data not shown). 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 1004-Year Degree or MoreSome CollegeHigh School Graduate or GEDLess than High SchoolTotal 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100Non-Hispanic Other Races**Non-Hispanic 66.5 45.4 54.6 36.5 63.5Women's Satisfaction with How Well Doctors Communicate,* by Level of Education, 2007 Source III.6: U.S. Agency for Healthcare R esearch and Quality , National CAHPS\u00ae Benchmarking DatabaseWomen's Satisfaction with Experiences Related to Health Plans,* by Race/Ethnicit y, 2007 Source III.6: U.S. Agency for Healthcare R esearch and Quality , National CAHPS\u00ae Benchmarking Database Percent of Wo menUnsatisfied Satisfied *Based on questions related to respondents' experiences with their health plans in the past 6 months (Medicaid respondents) or 12 months (commercial health plan respondents). **Includes American Indian/Alaska Natives, persons of more than one race, and persons of other and unspecified races.*Based on questions related to respondents' experiences with their doctors in the past 6 months (Medicaid respondents) or 12 months (commercial health plan respondents). 17.5 82.5 25.3 74.7 17.3 82.7 16.8 83.2 15.3 84.7 Percent of Wo menUnsatisfied Satisfied WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION 76 orGAn trAnSPlAnt Ation Since 1988, there have been 447,518 organ transplants in the United States. More than 25,600 of those transplants occurred between January 1 and November 30, 2008. In 2008, nearly 13,000 people donated organs in the U.S. Overall distribution of organ donation by sex was nearly even (6,574 males and 6,357 fe-males), though 60.3 percent of organs donated by living people were from females, and 59.4 percent of organs from deceased donors were from males. The need for donated organs greatly exceeds their availability, so waiting lists for organs are growing. As of February 13, 2009, there were 100,774 people awaiting a life-saving organ transplant. Females accounted for 41.6 percent of those patients but made up only 37.2 percent of those who received a transplant in 2008. 14 Among females waiting for an organ trans-plant, 44.3 percent were White, 30.9 percent were Black, and 16.6 percent were Hispanic. The kidney was the organ in highest demand, with 32,810 females awaiting this organ as of February 13, 2009. The number of organs donated annually has increased significantly since 1988, from 5,909 to a total of 14,400 in 2007. In 2003, the donation community began to work together through the Organ Donation Breakthrough Collaborative and other grassroots efforts to increase dona-tion. From 2003 to 2007, organ donation by deceased donors increased by an unprecedented 25.2 percent. One of the challenges of organ donation is obtaining consent from the donor's family or legal surrogate. Consent rates may vary due to religious beliefs, communication is-sues between health care providers and grieving families, perceived inequities in the allocation system, lack of knowledge of the wishes of the deceased, and lack of understanding concerning donation and funeral arrangements. 15 The Organ Procurement and T ransplanta- tion Network and the Scientific Registry of T ransplant Recipients are managed by HRSA's Healthcare Systems Bureau (HSB).

High rates of poverty and uninsur-ance among women in the U.S. border region contribute to barriers in accessing care. This special border health supplement to Women's Health USA is intended to provide policymakers and women's health advocates with a snapshot of women's health in the border region. The U.S. -Mexico border region refers to an area encompassing 100 kilometers (62 miles) north and south of the U.S. -Mexico border. This area includes 80 municipios in 6 Mexican states and 48 counties in 4 U.S. States. The Healthy Border 2010 initiative of the U.S. - Mexico Border Health Commission limits this region to 44 U.S. border counties, excluding Maricopa, Pinal, and La Paz counties in Ari-zona and Riverside County in California. The \"Border Region\" referred to in this supplement also refers to those 44 U.S. counties in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas. T echnical Note: While every effort has been made to cite the most recent and reliable data available for the border region, in some cases estimates are presented that represent only a portion of border counties. This is the case for estimates based on the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Local Area Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, each of which includes 9 border counties and represents 89.9 and 89.1 percent of the entire border population, respectively. It is acknowledged that the population residing in the counties included in these analyses may differ substantially from the population of those living in the remaining 35 border counties, who only account for about 10 percent of the border population. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 BORDER HEALTH 78 U.S.\u00acMexico Border PoPUlA tion In 2007, there were more than 7.2 million people in the United States living on the U.S. - Mexico border, with females comprising 50.6 percent of that total. Females younger than 35 years of age accounted for 50.9 percent of the female population, while those aged 35 -64 years accounted for 35.9 percent, and women aged 65 years and older accounted for 13.3 percent. The female population living on the U.S. - Mexico border is younger than the overall U.S. population. Nearly 23 percent of females in the U.S. border region were under 15 years of age compared to 19.4 percent of those in the entire United States. Similarly, females aged 45 years and older accounted for 35.8 percent of females in the border region, compared to 40.0 percent of females in the total U.S. population. The distribution of the population by sex was fairly even across all age groups with the excep-tion of those aged 65 years and older. Within that age group, women accounted for the ma-jority of the population (56.8 percent). 3,572U.S. Female Border Population,* by Age, 2007 Source IV .1: U.S. Census Bu reau, American Community SurveyU.S. Border Population,* by Age and Sex, 2007 Source IV .1: U.S. Census Bu reau, American Community Survey *Includes only non-institutionalized population not living in group housing.

In the U.S. border region, poverty status var- ied with age and sex. Women were significantly more likely than men to be living in poverty overall (17.8 versus 13.8 percent, respectively), and in every age group below 65 years of age. About 15 percent of men and women aged 65 years and older had household incomes below the poverty level. Among women, those aged 18-34 years were most likely to have household incomes below 100 percent of poverty (22.5 percent), followed by women aged 55 -64 years (17.5 percent). Poverty status also varies with household type. In 2007, women and men in the U.S. border region who were in married-couple fami-lies 2 were least likely to have household incomes below 100 percent of poverty (11.8 percent). Women who were heads of households with no spouse present were most likely to be living be-low the poverty level (31.4 percent). This was significantly more than among men who were heads of households with no spouse present (23.0 percent). Nearly one-quarter of women living alone or with non-relatives also lived in poverty in 2007, as did 19.4 percent of women living with parents or other relatives.Percent of Adults Percent of AdultsAdults Aged 18 and Older Living Below the Poverty Level, by Household Type and Sex, 2007* Source IV .2: U.S. Census Bu reau, C urrent P opulation Su rveyAdults Aged 18 and Older Living Below the Poverty Level, by Age and Sex, 2007* Source IV .2: U.S. Census Bu reau, C Years 18-34 Years Total1020304050 Living Alone or With Non-RelativesLiving With Parents or Other RelativesHead of Household, No Spouse PresentMarried, Spouse Present *Based on survey responses from 9 border counties representing 89.9 percent of the border population.

In 2007, 36.9 percent of adults in the U.S. border region re-ported themselves to be overweight (BMI of 25.0-29.9), while an additional 26.1 percent reported themselves to be obese (BMI of 30.0 or more). These rates were similar to those of the total U.S. population; 36.6 percent of adults re-ported themselves to be overweight, while 26.3 percent reported themselves to be obese (data not shown). 4 Overall, women and men in the U.S. bor- der region had similar rates of obesity (26.4 and 25.8 percent, respectively), but men were more likely than women to be overweight (45.3 ver-sus 28.5 percent, respectively; data not shown). Obesity among women varied by level of edu-cation. In 2007, women with less than a high school diploma were most likely to be obese (38.9 percent) followed by women with some college or technical school training (32.0 per-cent). Women who were college or technical school graduates were least likely to report being obese (15.9 percent). Rates of obesity among women in the U.S. border region also varied by race and ethnicity. Among women in 2007, Hispanics were more likely to be obese (31.6 percent) than non-His-panic White women (23.3 percent) and non-Hispanic women of other races (17.2 percent). Rates of overweight did not vary significantly among women by race and ethnicity.Percent of Adults Percent of Wo menNeither Overweight Nor Obes e Overweight ObeseObesity* Among Adults Aged 18 and Olde r, by Level of Education and Sex, 2007 Source IV .3: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Pr evention and H ealth Pr omotion, Behavioral Risk F actor Su rveillance S ystemOverweight and Obesity* Among Wo men Aged 18 and Olde r, by Race/Ethnicity, 2007 Source IV .3: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Pr evention and H ealth Pr omotion, Behavioral Than High SchoolTotal *Overweight is defined as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 25.0-29.9; obesity is defined as having a BMI of 30.0 or more.

Complications of diabetes are se-rious and may include blindness, kidney dam-age, heart disease, stroke, and nervous system disease. The main types of diabetes are Type 1, Type 2, and gestational (occuring only during pregnancy). Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, but may occur at any age. Type 2 diabetes is the most common; it is often diagnosed among adults but has in-creased among children. Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes include obesity, physical inactivity, and a family history of the disease. In 2007, 9.5 percent of adults in the U.S. border region reported having ever been told by a health professional that they have chronic dia-betes. This was slightly higher than among the overall U.S. adult population (8.0 percent). Diabetes prevalence in the U.S. border region varied among women by race and ethnicity, as well as age. Non-Hispanic White women were less likely to report having ever been told that they have diabetes (6.4 percent), than Hispanic and non-Hispanic women of other races (11.0 and 13.6 percent, respectively). Diabetes prevalence increased with age among women in the U.S. border region in 2007. Those aged 65 years and older were most likely to report having ever been told by a health professional that they have diabetes (21.6 percent), followed by women aged 45 -64 years (12.2 percent), and those aged 35 -44 years (4.2 percent). Among women, diabetes prevalence also in- creased with Body Mass Index. Nearly 18 per-cent of women in the border region who were obese had ever been diagnosed with diabetes, compared to 7.8 percent of women who were overweight but not obese, and only 4.4 percent of women who were at a healthy weight (data not shown). One objective in Healthy Border 2010 was to reduce the rate of deaths due to diabetes by 10 percent from 26.9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2000 to 24.2 per 100,000 in 2010. Limited progress has been made to date on this objective, however. The overall mortality rate due to diabe-tes was 26.8 in 2005. 5Percent of Adults Percent of WomenWomen Aged 18 and Older with Diabetes,* by Age, 2007 Source IV .3: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Pr evention and H ealth Pr omotion, Behavioral Risk F actor Su rveillance S ystemAdults Aged 18 and Older with Diabetes,* by Race/Ethnicity, 2007 Source IV .3: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Pr evention and H ealth Pr omotion, Behavioral Risk Factor Su 2.2FemaleMale 6.410.59.19.813.6 Non-Hispanic Other Races**Hispanic Non-Hispanic Whit e Total510152025 65 Years and Older 45-64 Years 35-44 Years 18-34 Years Total *Reported that they have ever been told by a health professional that they have diabetes; does not include gestational diabetes.

WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 BORDER HEALTH 82 HeAltH riSk BeHAViorS A number of behaviors, such as cigarette smoking and alcohol abuse can have negative long-term consequences for an individual's health. In 2007, 16.2 percent of adults in the U.S. border region were current cigarette smok-ers (smoked some days or every day). This was slightly lower than in the U.S. population over-all (19.8 percent; data not shown). Rates of cigarette smoking in the U.S. bor- der region varied by sex; men were significantly more likely than women to be cigarette smokers (20.7 versus 11.9 percent, respectively). Among women in the border region, cigarette smok-ing varied by race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic White women were most likely to be current cigarette smokers (15.5 percent), compared to 9.0 percent of Hispanic women and 9.7 percent of non-Hispanic women of other races. Men aged 21 and older in the U.S. border region were also more likely than women to have consumed alcohol in the past month (64.1 versus 44.9 percent, respectively). Among men and women aged 21 and older, past-month alco-hol consumption increased as level of education increased. Among women in the U.S. border region, those with a college or technical school degree were most likely to have consumed alco-hol in the past month (59.2 percent), compared to 36.8 percent of high school graduates, and 16.9 percent of those who did not graduate from high school. While behaviors such as these can contribute to negative health outcomes, other behaviors, such as regular leisure-time physical activity, can help reduce health risks. In 2007, 25.0 per-cent of adults in the U.S. border region report-ed that they did not engage in any leisure-time physical activity in the previous 30 days. Over-all, women were more likely than men to have reported being physically inactive (28.0 versus 21.8 percent, respectively). Among women, those with higher levels of education were more likely to have engaged in physical activity in the past month. Nearly 50 percent of women without a high school diploma did not engage in any leisure-time physical activity, compared to 30.2 percent of women who attended college or technical school, and 14.1 percent of women with a college or technical school diploma (data not shown).Percent of Adults Percent of AdultsPast Month Alcohol Consumption Among Adults Aged 21 and Olde r, by Level of Education and Sex, 2007* Source IV .3: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, N ational Center for Chronic Disease Pr evention and H ealth Pr omotion, Behavioral Risk Factor Su rveillance S ystemCurrent Cigarette Smoking Among Adults Aged 18 and Older, by Race/Ethnicity and Sex, 2007* Source IV .3: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Pr evention and H ealth Pr omotion, Behavioral e Total20406080 College/ Technical School Graduat eSome College / Technical SchoolHigh School GraduateLess Than High SchoolTotal *Results are based on survey responses from 9 counties representing 89.1 percent of the border population. **Includes non-Hispanic Blacks, Asian/Pacific Islanders, American Indian/Alaska Natives, persons of more than one race, and persons of other races not specified. *Results are based on survey responses from 9 counties representing 89.1 percent of the border population. WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 BORDER HEALTH 83 reProdUctiVe HeAltH From 2002 to 2004, there were an average of 123,116 live births per year in the U.S. border region. These births accounted for about 3.1 percent of total U.S. births during this period. The percentage of infants born at low and very low birth weight was lower in the U.S. border region than in the United States as a whole. Nearly 6.9 percent of infants born in the border region in 2002 -2004 had a low birth weight (less than 2,500 grams), compared to 7.97 percent of infants born in the United States. Similarly, 1.09 percent of infants in the border region were born at a very low birth weight (less than 1,500 grams), compared to 1.47 percent of infants in the United States. The percentage of live births delivered by ce- sarean section in 2002 -2004 was slightly higher in the border region than in the United States overall (29.8 versus 27.4 percent, respectively). The percentage of births to teen mothers was also higher in the border region than in the United States as a whole (5.01 versus 3.45 per-cent, respectively; data not shown). Gestational diabetes (occurring only during pregnancy) can pose health risks to a mother and her baby and women with the condition are at increased risk for developing diabetes lat-er in life. 6 In 2002, women giving birth in the U.S. border region were less likely to have had gestational diabetes than women in the U.S. population (2.44 versus 3.31 percent, respec-tively). Severe hypertension during pregnancy can result in preeclampsia, fetal growth restric-tion, premature birth, placental abruption, and stillbirth. 7 In 2002, women giving birth in the border region were also less likely to have preg-nancy-induced hypertension than women in the United States as a whole (2.05 versus 3.83 percent, respectively).Percent of MothersMaternal Morbidity and Risk Factors During Pregnanc y, by Location, 2002 Source IV .4: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, N ational Center for H ealth Statistics, Na tional Vital S tatistics S ystemLow and V ery Low Birth Weight Infants, by Location, 2002-2004 Source IV .4: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for He alth Statistics, Na tional Vital S tatistics RegionUnited States 246810 Very Low Birth W eight Low Birth W eight WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 BORDER HEALTH 84 leAdinG cAUSeS of deA tH In 2005, there were 47,386 deaths recorded in the U.S. border region. Females accounted for 22,637, or 47.8 percent, of these deaths. Overall, the death rate among this population was 849.7 per 100,000 males and 587.6 per 100,000 females, which is lower than that of the overall U.S. population (951.1 and 677.6 per 100,000, respectively; data not shown). The top 10 leading causes of death for fe- males accounted for 81.6 percent of all deaths (data not shown). Among females, heart dis-ease accounted for 25.3 percent of deaths, fol-lowed by malignant neoplasms, or cancer (22.0 percent), and cerebrovascular diseases or stroke (6.7 percent). The leading cause of death among both fe- males and males was heart disease, which was the cause of death for 145.2 and 229.4 per 100,000 people, respectively, followed by can-cer (135.0 and 194.7 per 100,000, respectively). Males had higher mortality rates than females for all of the leading causes of death except for Alzheimers disease, which was the cause of death for 28.3 per 100,000 females and 21.1 per 100,000 males. The leading causes of death among females in the U.S. border region were similar to that of the U.S. female population overall. In general, mortality rates due to the top 10 leading causes were lower among those in the border region, with the exception of Alzheimers disease and diabetes mellitus. Alzheimers disease account-ed for 28.3 deaths per 100,000 females in the border region, compared to 25.1 deaths per 100,000 females in the U.S. population over-all. Similarly, diabetes mellitus was the cause of death for 24.8 per 100,000 females in the border region, compared to 21.6 per 100,000 females among the general population (data not shown). 145.2Leading Causes of Death Among Females, 2005* Source IV .5: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Vital Statistics S ystemLeading Causes of Death (All Ages), by Sex, 2005* Source IV .5: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Vital S tatistics S ystem *Includes females of all ages in the 44 counties constituting the U.S.-Mexico border region.Female 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240Influenza an d )Heart Diseas e Heart Diseas e 25.3% Malignant Neoplasms (Cancer) 22.0 % Diabetes Mellitus 100,000 Population229.4 135.0 194.7 38.9 41.3 33.6 43.6 21.1 24.8 31.1 23.1 49.3 14.5 19.428.3Male *Includes people of all ages in the 44 counties constituting the U.S.-Mexico border region; rates are age-adjusted.Cerebrovascular Diseases (Stroke) 6.7% Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease 5.7%Alzheimers Disease 5.2% WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 BORDER HEALTH 85 cerVicAl cAncer Mort AlitY Regular cervical cancer screening can decrease the likelihood of death due to cervical cancer by detecting and treating precancerous lesions and invasive cancer before it has spread. Re-search suggests that high rates of cervical cancer mortality may be indicative of reduced access to health care, a lack of culturally competent communication, and a deficiency in patient/provider education. 8 In 2003 -2005, women in the U.S. border region had a greater mortality rate due to cervical cancer than the overall U.S. female population (2.7 versus 2.4 deaths per 100,000 women, respectively). Cervical cancer mortality rates vary by age. Younger women in the U.S. border region had higher mortality rates than the population as a whole; however, older women in the gener-al population had higher mortality rates than those in the U.S. border region. For instance, among women aged 35 -44 years, 3.3 deaths per 100,000 women in the border region were due to cervical cancer, compared to 2.8 deaths per 100,000 women in the United States. How-ever, among women aged 75 years and older, cervical cancer was the cause of 6.6 deaths per 100,000 women in the U.S. border region, compared to 7.0 deaths per 100,000 women in the United States.One objective in Healthy Border 2010 was to reduce the cervical cancer death rate by 30 percent, from 3.7 deaths per 100,000 women in 2000 to 2.6 per 100,000 by 2010. Significant progress has been made in achieving that goal with a cervical cancer mortality rate of 2.7 per 100,000 women in 2003 -2005. 5 Cervical cancer screening is recommended at least every 3 years beginning within 3 years of sexual activity or by age 21. A vaccine for genital human papillomavirus, the leading cause of cervical cancer, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2006 and is rec-ommended for female adolescents and women aged 9 -26 years. 9 Cervical Cancer Mortality Among Wo men, by Age and Residence, 2003-200 5 Source IV .5: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, National Vital Statistics S ystemRate per 100,000 Women 5.1 4.2 *Age-adjusted.12345678910 75 Years and Older65-74 Years 55-64 0.90.72.83.35.85.7 5.35.66.67.0Border Regio n United States WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 BORDER HEALTH 86 AcceSS to cAre People living on the U.S. -Mexico border face numerous barriers to accessing health care, including high rates of uninsurance and limited access to health care facilities. People who are uninsured are less likely than those with insur-ance to seek health care, which can result in poor health outcomes and higher health care costs. In 2007, more than one-quarter of adults in the U.S. border region lacked health insur-ance (26.7 percent), compared to 16.7 percent of adults in the total U.S. population. When considering only adults aged 18 -64 years, 31.2 percent of those in the U.S. border region lacked health insurance, compared to 19.6 percent of those in the general U.S. population (data not shown).Among adults aged 18 -64 years in the U.S. border region, men were more likely than women to lack health insurance overall (32.9 versus 29.6 percent, respectively) and in most age groups. Among both men and women, rates of uninsurance decreased as age increased. Among women, 35.6 percent of 18-to 34-year-olds lacked health insurance, compared to 26.8 percent of those aged 35 -54 years, and 22.8 percent of 55- to 64-year-olds. Among women aged 18 -64 years, just more than half reported having private health insur-ance in 2007, while 13.4 percent had public in-surance, and 6.2 percent had both private and public insurance (data not shown). Another indicator of access to health care is the rate at which adults receive preventive screenings and recommended tests. Cholesterol screenings are recommended at least every 5 years to detect high cholesterol, a risk factor for heart disease. In 2007, 69.1 percent of adults in the U.S. border region reported receiving a cho-lesterol screening within the previous 5 years, slightly less than the U.S. population overall (74.8 percent; data not shown). Cholesterol screening increased with age among both men and women. Among women in the U.S. border region, those aged 65 years and older were most likely to have received the screening in the past 5 years (91.6 percent) followed by 45- to 64-year-olds (84.0 percent), while those aged 18 - 34 years were least likely to have been screened (50.8 percent).Percent of Adults Percent of AdultsReceipt of Recommended Cholesterol Screening Among Adults Aged 18 and Olde r, by Age and Sex, 2007* Source IV .3: Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, N ational Center for Chronic Disease Pr evention and H ealth Pr omotion, Behavioral Risk Factor Su rveillance S ystemAdults Aged 18-64 Without Health Insurance,* by Age** and Sex, 2007 Source IV .2: U.S. Census Bu reau, C urrent Older 45-64 Years 35-44 Years 18-34 Years Total **Based on survey responses from 9 border counties representing 89.9 percent of the border population. **Due to the small number of uninsured adults aged 65 and older , a reliable estimate could not be produced.*Screening received within the past 5 years.

WOMEN'S HEALTH USA 2009 BORDER HEALTH 87 HrSA Pro GrAMS on t He Border The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) supports programs that promote access to health care services for un-derserved and vulnerable populations, includ-ing individuals living along the U.S. -Mexico border. Healthy Border 2010 aims to improve the quality of life, increase the number of years of healthy life, and eliminate health disparities. Four objectives focusing on the health and well-ness of women are to: Reduce the female breast cancer mortality rate by 20 percent; Reduce the cervical cancer mortality rate by 30 percent; Increase the proportion of mothers receiv- ing prenatal care in the first trimester to 85 percent; and Reduce the adolescent (15-17 years of age) pregnancy rate by 33 percent. HRSA's Office of Rural Health Policy (ORHP) manages the HRSA Border Health Initiative. ORHP assists rural communities in strengthening health care services by support-ing programs that aim to improve the recruit-ment and retention of health professionals and eliminate health disparities. In a collaborative effort, ORHP , the University of North Dakota Center for Rural Health, and the Rural Policy Research Institute developed the Rural Assis-tance Center (RAC; www.raconline.org). The RAC is a Web-based resource that assists resi-dents along the U.S. -Mexico border in locating and competing for funding opportunities that address the health care needs and challenges of their communities. ORHP's Border Health Ini-tiative also works closely with the U.S. -Mexico Border Health Commission (BHC), which is composed of the U.S. and Mexican secretaries of health, the chief health officers of the 10 bor-der States, and prominent community health professionals from both nations. The mission of the BHC is to provide international leadership to optimize health and quality of life along the U.S.-Mexico border. Information on the BHC can be found at www.borderhealth.org. HRSA's Maternal and Child Health Bu- reau (MCHB) currently funds six Healthy Start grantees along the U.S. -Mexico border. Healthy Start programs work to bring women into prenatal care early in their pregnancies, reducing infant mortality rates and low birth weights, while working to eliminate health dis-parities related to pregnancies. The six grantees are located in each of the four U.S. border States and utilize promotoras to provide support and guidance to the community; this model has been shown to work particularly well in border projects where program participants and the communities at large are faced with a variety of unique challenges and barriers. The HRSA Office of Women's Health has also translated several of its preventive health publications un-der the Bright Futures for Women's Health and Wellness Initiative to reach more Spanish speak-ing women (www.hrsa.gov/womenshealth). Other HRSA Offices and Bureaus contrib- ute to accomplishing the mission and vision of HRSA on the U.S. -Mexico border through a myriad of programs and initiatives. The Bu-reau of Health Professions (BHPr) supports Area Health Education Centers and Centers of Excellence, including the U.S. -Mexico Bor- der Health Centers of Excellence Consortium. The Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) delivers primary care services through a variety of Community Health Centers and Migrant Health Centers. The HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB) funds Ryan White Parts A -F including Special Programs of National Significance, AIDS Edu-cation and T raining Centers, Dental Programs, and the Minority AIDS Initiative.

The Census Bureau uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is poor. If a family's total income is less than that family's threshold, then that family and every individual in it is considered to be poor. Examples of 2007 poverty levels were $10,590 for an individual, and $21,027 for a family of four. These levels differ from the Federal Poverty Level used to determine eligibility for Federal programs. 3. U.S. Conference of Mayors.

If a family's total income is less than that family's threshold, then that family and every individual in it is considered to be poor. Examples of 2007 poverty levels were $10,590 for an individual, and $21,027 for a family of four. These levels differ from the Federal Poverty Level used to determine eligibility for Federal programs. 2. Families are groups of at least two people related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together. 3.
