All the necessary content is covered and assessed in this Teacher's Guide and the Learner's Book, and there are also lots of extra ideas and resources to make Social Sciences come alive in the classroom. Social Sciences consists of Geography and History, which are taught separately, but given the same amount of teaching time each term. Both should be taught and assessed as separate subjects during every term of the school year. Although Geography and History are taught separately, the curriculum is designed so that you can make links between the two in terms of content, skills and concepts.Introduction Introduction The Social Sciences curriculum The general aims of the Social Sciences curriculum are to: Encourage Phase). Provide opportunities for learners to look at their own worlds in new ways. Create opportunities for learners to develop a critical perspective. Introduce learners to a world beyond their everyday life and reality. Provide access to knowledge that learners might not otherwise be able to access. Develop expertise and confidence in learners as a result of in-depth learning (suggested time for each topic is stated). Facilitate learning through different forms of text (oral, written and visual). T rain learners to speculate, to debate, to make connections, to select, to prioritise, and to tackle real issues and important issues. Provide opportunities for learners to write regularly, with a clear progression in length and complexity through the grades (evidence of learner's work should be kept in the learner's notebook, folder or file). Resources for teaching and learning Social Sciences Each learner should have: A quality textbook that is suitable for the grade, context and language level of the learner, for example Study & Master Social Sciences. A notebook (for writing in), which should be covered with paper (and plastic, if possible), kept neat and looked after - this is an important record of the learner's work. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 1 2012/09/01 9:59 AM2 Introduct Ion Access to wall maps (World map, Africa map and South Africa map). Access to a globe. Access to a set of atlases and dictionaries. Access to books about the History and Geography topics. Access to visual material about the History and Geography topics. In Social Sciences learners should read and write often, starting with sentences and paragraphs and building up to longer pieces of work. A lot of this writing work can be achieved by working through the activities provided in the Learner's Book of Study & Master Social Sciences. Other reliable and relevant sources of information that enrich the curriculum should also be used - carefully selected and reviewed by the teacher. Additional resources: Magazines and newspapers with articles relevant to the topics. Access to a TV/DVD and/or CD player to present appropriate visual and audiovisual material. Access to the Internet and appropriate educational websites. Map/s of the learner's local area. The MapPack Project will give free maps and additional information to schools. Contact them at The MapPack Project, Private Bag X10, Mowbray 7700, Phone: 021 658 4300, Email: ngi@ruraldevelopment.gov.za. Teaching and learning History History is the study of change and development in a society over time. History is also a process of enquiry that involves asking questions about the past: what happened?, when?, why?, etc. The teaching of History should encourage learners to be interested in and enjoy the study of the past and how it was shaped. Learners should develop an understanding of historical concepts, including historical sources and evidence. The specific aims and skills of History The specific aims and skills - summarised in the table on the next page - are met through the teaching of content, skills and concepts. The table lists the specific aims, and examples of skills. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 2 2012/09/01 9:59 AM3 Introduct IonSpecific aims of History Examples of skills involved Find a variety of kinds of information about the pastUse and bring together different sources of information Select relevant information Decide about the importance and relevance of information to choose and use for different purposes and contexts Decide whether information can be trusted Investigate where information came from, whether it is accurate, and what point of view is represented in the information See something that happened in the past from more than one point of viewContrast information and compare points of view about the same person or event Explain why events in the past are often interpreted differentlyRecognise and understand how and why different sources and people come to different conclusions Debate about what happened in the past on the basis of the available evidenceDebate and discuss own and others' points of view about aspects of history, based on evidence Write history in an organised way, with a logical line of argument Write history texts which have an introduction, which set out relevant information in a structured way, and which come to a conclusion Demonstrate understanding of the importance of heritage and conservationExplain how and why people and events are publicly remembered and commemorated The study of History should also support democratic citizenship through: Explaining and encouraging the values of the Constitution. Encouraging civic responsibility and responsible leadership. Promoting human rights and peace. Preparing young people for local, regional, national, continental and global responsibility. Concepts in History History is in sources and in evidence, and it is also in the way sources and evidence are interpreted. There are many ways of looking at the same thing in the past. It may involve: Different points of view of people in the past with different positions in society. Different ways in which historians write about people and sources. Different ways in which people today see the lives of people in the past. This requires a multi-perspective approach. Other important concepts in History that learners should understand are: Cause and effect: The reasons for events and the results of these events, and the way that humans behave in the events and as a result of those events. Change and continuity: Over a period of time it is possible to compare and contrast what has changed and what has remained the same. Time and chronology: History is studied and written in order - it is important to be able to place events in the order in which they happened in time; a timeline is useful to develop this concept. Gr6 TG.indb 3 2012/09/01 9:59 AM4 Introduct IonTeaching and learning Geography Geography is the study of the human and physical environment. Geography examines both physical (environmental) and human processes over space and time. Everything in Geography has a spatial aspect to it and happens in an environment that is always changing. The specific aims and skills of Geography The specific aims and skills - summarised in the table below - are met through the teaching of content, skills and concepts. The table lists the specific aims, and examples of skills. Specific aims of Geography Examples of skills involved Develop curiosity about the world we live inAsk questions, identify issues, listen and discuss with interest; and collect and refer to different types of information Acquire a good general knowledge of places and the natural forces at work on EarthRead and use sources for information; and use information to describe, explain and answer questions about people and places Understand the interaction between society and the natural environmentConsider, synthesise and organise information; make links between cause and effect; acknowledge and appreciate diverse lifestyles and world views Think independently and be able to support ideas with knowledge Use geographical knowledge to solve problems, to discuss and debate issues, to recognise bias, to develop own ideas, and to suggest solutions to problems Care about our planet and the well-being of all who live on itEngage in an informed and sensitive way with issues relating to the planet, its people and resources Understand and work with a range of sources \u2014 including maps, data and photographsUse and draw maps; identify and extract information from texts, atlases and other sources; work with data and statistics; cross-reference information Observe and engage with phenomena in the local environmentObserve, interview and record; apply social skills; process, interpret and evaluate data Find out about places, people, events and issues using different sources (e.g. books, people, photographs, the Internet)Devise and frame questions; develop and apply research skills; analyse, process and present information Communicate ideas and information Speak in a clear and informed way; write in a structured and coherent way; draw maps and visual information; provide reasoned explanations Make informed decisions and take appropriate actionWork co-operatively, and independently; plan and evaluate actions systematically and critically Map skills The study of Geography requires learners to interpret and present different types of visual information, for example: maps, graphs, globes, photographs, aerial views and drawings. This visual literacy is an essential type of literacy for learners to practise and develop. In the CAPS curriculum there is special focus for one term of each grade on aspects of using and making maps and other visual sources. These topics aim to achieve focused and systematic development of visual skills. However, learners should work with maps during the whole year and map use should be integrated into topics throughout each grade. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 4 2012/09/01 9:59 AM5 Introduct Geography The following are key concepts for learners to know and understand in Geography: Space and spatial patterns and trends: The location of people and places in the world. Similarity and difference: How environments and lifestyles compare and the reasons for similarities and differences. Movement: How and why people, goods, water, land and air move and change. Planet Earth: Land, air and water. Human settlement: Where people live and why. Human activities: What people do, how the environment affects them and how people affect the environment. Interdependence: The links between climate, vegetation, wildlife, resource distribution, and human settlement and activity. Change: The changing nature of people and places. Overview of topics for Intermediate Phase Social Sciences The following tables show an overview of all the topics for Geography and History Intermediate Phase, organised per term. These topics are then broken up into sub-topics for teaching - topics and sub-topics are organised into units in the Study & Master Social Sciences books. Geography content overview Term Grade 4 topics Grade 5 topics Grade 6 topics 1 Places where people live (settlements)Map skills (focus: Africa) Map skills (focus: World) 2 Map skills Physical features of South AfricaTrade (focus: South Africa and world) 3 Food and farming in South AfricaWeather, climate and vegetation of South AfricaClimate and vegetation around the world 4 Water in South Africa Minerals and mining in South AfricaPopulation \u2014 why people live where they do (focus: South Africa and world) History content overview Term Grade 4 topics Grade 5 topics Grade 6 topics 1 Local history Hunter-gatherers and herders in southern AfricaAn African kingdom long ago in southern Africa: Mapungubwe 2 Learning from leaders The first farmers in southern AfricaExplorers from Europe find southern Africa 3 Transport through time An ancient African society: EgyptDemocracy and citizenship in South Africa 4 Communication through timeA heritage trail through the provinces of South AfricaMedicine through S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 5 2012/09/01 9:59 AM6 IntroductIonTime allocation and weighting of topics Both Geography and History should be taught and assessed in every term of the school year. Th e teaching time for Social Sciences in the Intermediate and Senior Phases is 3 hours per week (e.g. 1,5 hours for Geography and 1,5 hours for History). A term of 10 weeks should have 30 hours of contact time. Th e total time allocation for History is about 15 hours per 10-week term, and the same for Geography. In order to plan the total time available, suggested time allocation (and weighting) is given for each topic/unit. Assessment in Social Sciences Assessment is a planned and continuous process of identifying, gathering and interpreting information about the performance of learners. Teachers should use the information they gain from evidence of achievement to improve the process of learning and teaching. Assessment should be both informal (assessment for learning) and formal (assessment of learning). Giving feedback to learners must always be a part of any assessment process. Geography and History must be assessed separately, and learners must complete formal assessment tasks each term for Geography and for History. Assessment marks for each subject should also be shown separately in school reports: a score for Geography and a score for History. Th e scores should then be added together and divided by two to give an average score or mark for Social Sciences. Types of assessment Informal assessment is the daily or lesson-by-lesson monitoring of learners' progress. Learners can be informally assessed through: observation of learner discussion with learner demonstration with learner learner-teacher meetings informal classroom interaction. Informal assessment should be used to provide feedback to the learners and to inform planning for teaching. Teachers don't have to record informal assessment, but they can choose to record some or any of it. Th e results of informal assessment are not used for promotion and certifi cation purposes, but it is nevertheless useful to have a record of learners' progress throughout the year. Formal assessment tasks are part of a formal programme of assessment for a particular grade and year. Formal assessment tasks are marked and the mark is recorded by the teacher for progression and certifi cation purposes. Formal assessment provides teachers with a systematic way of evaluating how well learners are progressing in a grade and in a particular subject. Examples of formal assessment include tests, examinations, and all types of written work, practical tasks, projects, oral presentations, demonstrations and performances. This logo in the Learner's Book indicates a Formal Assessment Task. 6 of formal assessment, learners are required to complete one project in Social Sciences in each grade. They therefore do a project in either Geography and History in a given year. Projects should be started towards the beginning of a term, and learners must be given a reasonable due date to hand in the final work. Teachers should make sure they have enough time for assessing the projects, and the learners' progress must be monitored regularly. In the Intermediate Phase the CAPS curriculum divides the projects between the two subjects as follows. Grade Term Subject 4 1 History project 5 3 Geography project 6 3 History project Learners are required to write an end-of-year examination in both Geography and History. You may wish to set this examination yourself, based on the needs of your learners, and the work you have covered through the year. However, we have provided an examination for both aspects of Social Sciences, as well as marking memoranda, for your convenience. The sample examination papers can be found in the Extra resources section of this Teacher's Guide. There is also a useful record sheet for recording marks for the FAT component of assessment. You will find the History project for Grade 6 on page 154 of the Study & Master Social Sciences Learner's Book and page 143 of this Teacher's Guide (Module 7, Unit 8: Research project: A biography). Steps in assessing Assessment can be achieved in four main steps or stages. 1. Generate and collect e vidence of achievement 3. Record findings about achiev ement4. Use evidence of achie vement to understand and help learner2. Evaluate evidenc AM8 knowledge, teachers will be assessing the learner's ability to achieve the aims and demonstrate the skills outlined in the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS). Teachers will need to collect and evaluate evidence of a learner's achievement, and to record the evidence, if appropriate to that type of assessment. The aims and skills for Geography and History must be applied in the content knowledge as well as in the activities, tasks, projects, tests and examinations. Assessing writing Assessment usually involves writing - this means that learners should be taught writing skills in Social Sciences and should be helped to practise those skills. For writing longer texts, especially essays, learners need to be trained to: Select the information they want to include - only choose what is relevant. Arrange the information - put it together with other information and integrate it. Connect information - to make a logical order, or a developed argument. As well as all types of written work, other ways of showing evidence of achievement should also be used for assessment, for example: oral work, discussion, debate, role plays, visual work, presentations and drama. Plagiarism (using some else's work and pretending it is your own) is a problem in many institutions of learning. Whether the plagiarism involves copying from a book, copying another learner's work, or cutting and pasting from the Internet, it is wrong - like 'stealing' someone else's work. Learners must be trained to show in their work whenever they quote something from a source, and to give their references for the source. Learners should also be trained not to rely too much on sources and references, but rather to show their understanding by re-writing or re-phrasing source information in their own words. Planning assessment Setting good assessment tasks can be very challenging and teachers are encouraged to use carefully selected textbooks as a guide, and to share good assessment tasks with other teachers. The following steps were followed in the planning and design of assessment tasks for Study & Master Social Sciences.1. Clarify the purpose of the assessment. (Why?) 2. Decide on the task or activity to be assessed. (Which?) 3. Decide on the content, concepts and skills to be assessed. (What?) 4. Select a format for learner presentation - ho w will the learner show evidence or demonstrate achievement? of assessment In Grade 6 the programme of assessment is structured as follows.

On that day, South Africa became a democracy. All South African adults were finally allowed to vote. They could vote for the political party they wanted in government. Before this, only white people were allowed to vote. Today, we celebrate 27 April as Freedom Day. Key question What is a democracy and how does it work? G In 1994, millions of South Africans waited for hours in long queues for the chance to vote. Activity 1. Interview two adults about what it was like to vote in 1994 when South Africa became a democracy. Ask them these questions. Add two questions of your own. a) Was it the first time you had voted? b) Why did you decide to vote? c) Where did you vote? d) What do you remember about that day? e) How did you feel before voting? f) How did you feel after voting? g) Do you think it is important for people to vote? Explain why, or why not. When decisions are made in a democratic way, everyone has an equal say. Decisions can be made democratically anywhere, including at home and at school.

If possible give each pair a copy of the world map from the Extra resources section, for the learners to write their answers in pencil on the map. Give learners 15-20 minutes to complete the Activity and then discuss the answers as a class. This should give you a good sense of what learners know and remember about the world map and map work skills from Grades 4 and 5. This Activity should be quite easy and straightforward for learners to complete correctly. Show the class the globe and point out the continents and oceans, and the equator. Then point out the lines of latitude and longitude, and explain their purpose in helping us find places (navigation). W alk around the class so that all learners see the lines of latitude. Point out the North and South Pole and the Greenwich meridian line - which is the 0\u00b0 line of longitude. Explain that the shape of the Earth is called a sphere (round ball), and that the equator divides the sphere into 2 hemispheres: northern and southern. Point to the Greenwich meridian line and show the eastern and western hemispheres. If you cannot get a globe, try to get a range of pictures showing the world map as a globe so that learners can see the difference between the flat two-dimensional representation we use for maps and the more realistic three-dimensional globe. Read through Learner's Book page 6 with the class and ask questions related to the content to check learners' understanding of the concepts so far, and to see where more explaining might be needed.Unit 11Unit Latitude and longitude Learner's Book pages 6-15 4 hoursThe Teacher's Guide The curriculum information is clearly laid out on the opener page.Curriculum concepts Time allocation 47 UNIT 4 MODULE 3Individual 1.

Unpredictable rainfall and deforestation have seen the Sahara Desert encroach on the historic town over the last few years, but now irrigation projects are helping farmers to fight back. Timbuktu is fortunate to be just a few kilometres from the massive inland delta of the River Niger, and draws water from vast underground aquifers - bodies of permeable rock which transmit water. A women's co-operative in the village of Kabara, south of Timbuktu, is using these water sources to plant eucalyptus trees. They nurture them for two years, after which the trees can then survive almost without rain. In a region where the annual rainfall is less than 400 mm, reforestation is essential to put nutrients back into the soil, and to prevent erosion by the harsh desert winds. Windbreaks and vegetables Despite some scientists' concerns that eucalyptus trees can drain large amounts of water out of the soil, Daouda Diarra from the World Food Programme in Mali says they are a good choice in the desert environment. 'Eucalyptus is especially recommended for its rapid growth and the protection it gives against strong winds,' Mr Diarra says. 'In dry zones, a five-year-old tree's root system actually pumps water back into the water table.' The co-operative's president, Zeinabi Maiga, says they can now grow beans and other vegetables on land which was previously useless. 'Before the co-operative project started, our husbands were always away from home looking for work,' she says. 'But now they don't have to go because we can grow food here.' Mrs Maiga says there have been other benefits too: 'The men always used to take decisions for the family, now the women are also making a contribution.'

What country in southern Africa is on the latitude 30\u00b0? Where does the eastern hemisphere start? Where is the line that divides the southern and northern hemispheres - how many degrees is it? What southern hemisphere countries lie on latitude 45\u00b0? Ask learners to work in pairs to read Learner's Book pages 8-11, and do the Activities on Learner' s Book page 7, 9 and 10. While the pai rs are working go around the class to help and to assess them informally. When the pairs have completed the work, go through the answers as a class. As you move on to 'Locating places using lines of latitude and longitude' (Learner' s Book page 12), remind learners of the content from Grade 5 - working with grids and finding co-ordinates. Some learners may also know about co-ordinates from GPS devices or receiv ers, for example in their parents ' cars. (The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite navigation system in space that pro vides information about location anywhere on the Earth.) Read the text on Learner's Book page 12 aloud, and ask for volunteers to read each of the 5 bulleted points. Read through the Activity on Learner's Book page 13 and make sure learners understand what they are requir ed to do. Then ask learners to work on their own to complete the Activity in their notebooks. (For Question 4 learners work with a partner .) Draw the grid accurately on the board (or on a large piece of paper) and ask for volunteers to answer the questions using the big grid. For the last Activity of the Unit, start by asking learners to look at the map on Learner' s Book pages 14-15 and to tell you the co-ordinates of Mexico City and Nair obi. This will give ever yone practice at finding co-ordinates. Then ask learners to work in pairs to complete the Activity on Learner' s Book pages 14-15 and to write the answers in their notebooks. For Question 2 of the Activity on Learner's Book page 15, learners should draw the table with a ruler and pencil in their notebooks and fill in the city names using a pen. Finding the information on the map and filling in the information in the table can take a lot of classroom time, but this is an important task for learners' skills development and you should informally assess the work. If you want the Activity to be completed more quickly, ask each pair of learners to work with another pair - each group of 4 shares the work of filling out the table (each pair works on half the list, then the group combines answers). There is a photocopiable filled-in table in the Extra resour ces section; give it to learners so they can mark their own work. They should then glue or tape the photocopied table in their notebooks, after their marked table. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 3 2012/09/01 9:59 AM4 UNIT 1 MODULE 1After going through the answers with the class and checking all the co-ordinates, take in the notebooks for informal assessment of the Activities in this Unit. Please note: Ask learners to look for and bring newspaper articles about: places in your province, other South African provinces, African countries, cities anywhere in the world, and physical landmarks in the world. Keep the articles in a folder, big envelope or plastic sleeve - for use in Unit 3. Bright idea!

Decide whether the class will draw a chair or a table so that all learners are dealing with the same object. Make sure every one can see the table or chair from where they are sitting. Allow 3 minutes for learners to do the drawing in their notebooks. 1. Use only a pencil to draw the chair/table. You may not use an eraser or a ruler . Ask learners to hold up their drawings for a short while so that you and other learners can see and comment on the drawings. 2. Then discuss the questions as a class: - Did you get the propor tions correct? (The sizes of the different parts of the chair or table.) - What did you find easy? - What did you find difficult? - What methods or tools would help you to draw accurately? After the discussion, ask learners to quietly read the text on Learner's Book page 16, and then talk about the information as a class - for example, ask questions to check learners' understanding, and encourage questions from learners. Using the text and pictures on Learner's Book pages 17-18, along with information from the Bright Idea! for this Unit, explain the different types of map scales and give more examples (e.g. using the classroom wall map, or maps in an atlas). Ask learners to read the Activity on Learner's Book page 18 and then put up their hands if they know the answers. Discuss the answers as a class and make sure that ever yone understands the concept of scale. Ask learners to work on their own to read the text and complete the Activity on Learner' s Book page 19 in their notebooks.

Ask learners to work in pairs to read the text and do the Activities on Learner' s Book pages 20-21. Go around the class to help and assess pairs informally while they are working. As a class, share the answers to the questions in the Pair Activities - ask for volunteers from the pairs to share their answers. After the discussion, read through the Activities on Learner's Book pages 22 and 23 and check that ever yone understands what they need to do. Then ask learners to work on their own to complete the Activities in their notebooks, and then hand in their notebooks for informal assessment. Please note: Ask learners to look for and bring newspaper articles about: places in your pro vince, other South African pro vinces, African countries, cities anywhere in the world, and physical landmarks in the world. (These will be used in the next unit.) Bright idea! Map scale and measuring distance A map is a visual repr esentation of a much larger are a of land. In order to be use ful, a map must be small enough to be handled by a pers on. Imagine drawing a map of the Ear th that was full-size . Of cour se that is ridiculous! A full-size map of the Ear th would not only be too large to be use ful, but it would also be impractic al to make . Maps are sc aled down so that they fit on the av ailable paper or scr een. When sc aling down a map, ev ery par t of the map is sc aled by the same amount. This ensure s that ev ery object on the map is the same propor tion as ev erything else on the map. If a city is twic e as large as a neighbouring town, an acc urate sc aled map will show the same relationship on paper . The drawn city will be twic e as large as the dra wn to wn. Because the Ear th is round, and maps are flat, it is impos sible to cre ate a map with a perfect sc ale. Some par ts of the map will be too large , while others will be too small. The larger a territ ory shown on a map, the gre ater the dist ortions in sc ale will be. It is import ant that we rec ognise how to re ad, unders tand, and use sc ale on diff erent maps . Ther e are three common methods used by map maker s to depict sc ale. The se methods are re ferred to as the graphic method (graphic or line sc ale), the verb al method (w ord st atement), and the ratio or fractional method. A graphic or line s cale show s sc ale using a line, with sep arations marked by smaller int ersecting lines , similar to a ruler. One side of the sc ale repre sents the dist ance on the map, while the other side repr esents the true dist ances of objects in re al life . By measuring the dist ance bet ween two objects on a map, and then re ferring to the graphic sc ale, it is eas y to calculat e the actual dist ance bet ween thos e same items . A wor d scale gives a writt en des cription of map dist ance, such as 'One centime tre equals one equals ten kilometr es'. The verb al method of depicting sc ale simply use s wor ds to des cribe the ratio bet ween the map' s sc ale and the re al world.

Some learners might find this Activity difficult and their drawings may not look v ery much like the table/chair. Share with the whole class any drawings showing good examples of correct proportions (or perspective). The challenge of this Activity is to draw the table or chair to scale so that although it is smaller and on a flat piece of paper, its size and proportions (parts) are true to real life. Methods or tools to help more accurate drawing to scale include: a ruler, a tape measure, a piece of string, and engineering surveying instruments and tools. Individual Learner's Book page 18 1. Africa is bigger than North America and South America. 2. China is bigger - by land area only (if you add water surface area to land area then the USA is slightly bigger than China). Individual Learner's Book page 19 1. 1 cm represents 1 km 1 cm represents 5 km 1 cm represents 100 km 1 cm represents 10 000 km 2. 1:50 000 000 (smallest) 1:100 0001:50 0001:10 0001:1 000 1:50 (largest) 3. 1:50 000 000map using the verbal method is easy. Measure the distance on the map, and then follow the verbal directions to calculate the actual distance . The fractional method for showing the scale of a map uses a represen tative fraction or ratio to describe how many units on the earth' s surface is equal to one unit on the map. This can be shown as 1:50 000 or 1/50 000. In this example 1 unit of distance on the map repres ents 50 000 of the same units of distance in the real world. This means that 1 cm on the map repres ents 50 000 centimetr es in the real world, and 1 m on the map represen ts 50 000 metres on the map, etc. Maps are often known as large scale or small s cale. A map that depicts a small territory is referr ed to as a large scale map. This is because the area of land being repres ented by the map has been scaled down less, or in other words, the scale is larger. A large scale map only shows a small area, but it shows it in great detail. A map depicting a large area, such as an entire country, is considered a small scale map. In order to show the entire country the map must be scaled down until it is much smaller. A small scale map shows more territory, but it is less detailed.

Use maps from the Learner' s Book, atlases, the classroom wall maps, and maps from magazines, newspapers and the Internet. Giv e learners 2 points on each map and tell them they need to work out the distance between the 2 points using the map' s scale and their rulers. You need to measure and calculate the distances between points before the learners - so that you know the answers, but also so that you can help learners with measuring. For extension learners you can expand the exer cise of measuring by asking them to plan a road trip by working out the distances between stops, and the total distance. For example, if they' re going to drive from Cape Town to Cairo - they need to calculate the distances between the cities/towns where they will stop (they must stop driving every night); they also need to find out the co-ordinates of all the places where they will stop, and the total kilometres travelled in a one-way trip.

If learners are already working with atlases this Unit will be a useful consolidation and practice of that work. Show learners the contents of the atlas used by the class - that is, the contents page/s, the different types of information/maps in the atlas, and the index pages. This should be a book that learners feel confident about using for their learning and assessment. Ask learners to work in pairs to read through the text on Learner's Book page 24 and do Questions 1 and 2 of the Activity on page 25 in their notebooks. Learners should then work on their own to write the answers to Question 3 of the Activity , and then swap notebooks with another learner for pair marking. Ask for volunteers to share their answers for questions 1-3 with the class so that all learners can check their answers. Ask learners to work in pairs for the Activity on Learner's Book page 26, and then to join with another pair to swap books and mark each other' s answers using the filled-in table (Extra resources, Gr eatest features table). Ask learners to work on their own for Question 1 of the Activity on Learner' s Book page 30, using a classroom atlas and writing the answers in their notebooks. For Question 2 of the Activity on Learner's Book page 30, ask learners to work in groups of 3-5 to share newspaper articles to find and note places. Remind learners to write which articles they used as their sources for answering the questions. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 13 2012/09/01 9:59 AM14 UNIT 3 MODULE 1 For Question 3 of the Activity on Learner's Book page 30, spend some time working with each of the groups to find the places in the class atlases. Ask groups to put up the newspaper articles on the classroom wall as a resour ce for reading; ask learners to bring more articles on similar topics during the rest of the term. Finally, read the text on Learner's Book page 31 and talk about what is possible today in terms of global air travel. If you have brochures and pamphlets from a travel agent, ask the groups to share and look at these resour ces.

You will need to use the class atlas or the map at the back of the Learner 's Book (pages 180-181) to find examples of places in Question 1. Help individual learners while they are working if they are struggling - this is a good opportunity for informal assessment of learners' map skills. You can also pair achieving learners with learners who are struggling with map work so that the stronger learners can help (peer teach) other learners (not do the work for them, but support in the steps of finding the answer). Group Learner' s Book page 30 2. Befor e learners work with the newspaper articles you should have a look through them to find and note examples of places - as asked in Question 2 of the Activity.

Use the class atlas to find and note a few examples for Question 3. Check that the groups are r esponding correctly to the question. Pair Learner' s Book page 31 This is a creativ e and interesting Activity. Learners should work in pairs to plan their trip and agree on the cities and countries they will visit, and then each draws the outline map in their notebooks, showing the route. When you informally assess this Activity check that learners have met all the criteria (rules) for the trip: starts in Johannesburg, flies westwards, visits 10 cities and 5 countries, and travels in both northern and southern hemispheres.

Ask learners to follow in their books while you read the text and talk about the pictures on Learner' s Book page 36. Check learners' understanding: trade is the exchange of something for something else; it can involv e exchanging goods, or goods for money, or other forms of currency that have value. Ask learners to work on their own to complete the Activity on Learner's Book page 37, writing the answers in their notebooks. Then ask learners to work in pairs to compare and discuss answers. As a class, take turns to read aloud the text on Learner's Book page 38 and the picture captions on the map of South Africa on Learner' s Book page 39. Check that learners understand the concepts on these pages by asking questions based on the reading and encouraging learners to ask questions. Put the class into groups of 5 for the Activity on Learner's Book page 38. Giv e learners 20-25 minutes to play the game, and then discuss Question 5 as a class. Ask learners to work in pairs to do the Activity on Learner's Book page 39, and to write the answers in their notebooks.

Trade in early African history Before the Iron Age in southern Afric a mos t people wer e nomadic and survived by hunting wild animals and gathering wild plant s. Mos t chiefdoms wer e small in size and people did not regar d land as proper ty. This re sulted in fairly harmonious co-e xistence as no tribe needed to be or was sufficien tly more pow erful to conquer another . Food and wat er wer e readily av ailable and people simply follo wed the animals they hunt ed as the seas ons changed. This made the nomadic life more practic al than se ttling in one place . Around 10 000 ye ars ago, in diff erent par ts of the world, people began domestic ating animals and plant s. The se wer e the firs t agricult ural skills developed by our ance stors. The y no longer had to rely on the av ailability of wild animals or plant s but they could produc e their own food. Farming allow ed people to se ttle in to wns. As to wns gre w and dev eloped, societ y became more comple x, pa ving the wa y for more sophis ticated administration and politics . Now that communitie s could cultiv ate plant crop s and rais e live stock, especially cat tle, they some times had too much of both. This surplus became the object of trade . Group s began to ex change their product s for goods they couldn 't produc e themselv es. Tr ade rout es wer e es tablished and ivory and gold from Afric a was traded for cloth, glass beads and other luxury product s from afar . Iron Age technology was transmit ted acro ss Afric a by Ban tu-speaking people who migrat ed to the south from North and Cen tral Afric a. Their language and cult ure mixed with thos e of the group s they met , which is why many Afric an people are Ban tu-speaking. The y also brough t iron smelting technology and agricult ure to thes e group s and founded gre at kingdoms like Gre at Zimbab we, Mapungubw e and Thulamela. T hulamela is in the north-e astern par t of South Afric a near the South African border with Zimbab we and Moz ambique in Limpopo Pro vince. This area is also known as the Pafuri are a of the Kruger National Park and is next to the Le vuvhu River , which flow s int o the Limpopo River . The kingdom exis ted bet ween about 1240 ACE and 1700 ACE. Scien tists believe that the ance stors of the tablished Thulamela. The Shona people initially practis ed agricult ure and bred animals, especially cattle , to make a living. During the 14th cen tury, or the 1300s , they began trading gold and ivory with Arab and, after them, Por tuguese trader s along the eas tern co ast of Afric a. Archaeologists disc overed gold beads , gold wire , gongs and a pot sherd with trac es of molten gold at Thulamela. Ther e wer e also for ged tools and we apons, which show that they had begun to extr act and use met als around 800 ye ars ago, and had con verted them to st eel without any Europe an influenc e. Like all other cities Thulamela' s rubbish dump tells a gre at deal about the people who lived there . Archaeologis ts found gold jew ellery, iron pot sherds, glass beads , spinning whorls, se wing needles and a piece of Chines e porc elain. This show s that met al was smelted, which means they had advanc ed technology and trade con tacts with the Far Eas t.

They should remember examples of 'natural resources ' from Grade 5. In this Unit you 'll develop the concept of 'resour ces' - the value of resour ces and how a money value is worked out for a resour ce or product. Read through Learner's Book pages 42-43 while learners follow in their books. Write key words and terms on the board, for example: - The value of something is the price or money that is paid for that thing. - S econdary products have more value (cost more). - The producer 's profit is the money made after production costs are paid. - R etailer's profit is the final seller' s profit (e.g. the shop owner). Discuss the costs of making bread (Learner's Book page 42) with the class - write the costs on the board. Ask learners to think of reasons for and against making one's own bread at home. Ho w much money could someone save if they bought flour and made their own bread? What would happen if ever yone started making their own bread and no one bought bread from shops? R ead the text on Learner' s Book page 44 'Ho w is chocolate manufactured?' and ask for volunteers to read each caption in the flow chart 'Fr om cocoa to chocolate' on Learner' s Book pages 44-45.

Gold mining Gold mining involve s the removal of gold from deep in the ground. The known history of gold mining goes back as far as the 4th millennium BCE. During the Bronze Age, the use of gold steadily increased as it was found to be soft and easy to work with. Gold rushes around the world in the 1800s saw the start of regions such as California, Victoria in Australia and the Transv aal in South Africa as thousands of wealth seekers were lured into shanty towns. Most gold rushes weren't sustained and many areas were left empty as the illusion of quick money wore off. The formalised gold mining sector then took control and regulated the gold mining in South Africa. Today, companies like Anglo American, Harmony Gold and BHP Billiton are established as industry managers of gold mining in South Africa. Ther e are sever al methods and proces ses that are used to extract gold from the earth. Gold mining in South Africa typically involve s methods such as panning, sluicing, dredging, hard rock mining and by-product mining. For most effectiv e gold mining in South Africa, the method used is hard rock mining, since gold reserv es are usually within rock deep underground. The invention of industrial air cooling and air quality control syst ems saw gold mines reach new depths - the deepest being 3 900 metres . Over 50 % of all gold reserv es are found in South Africa, where the Witwater srand holds the world's largest gold reef deposit. Gold mining in South Africa employs more than 200 000 people and earns tens of billions of Rands in foreign currency earnings. Source: http://www.proje ctsiq.com/gold-m ining-in-south- africa.htm (extracted and adapted) The many uses of goldThe production of ornamental objects (for decoration) was probably the first use of gold over 6 000 years ago. Gold is found in the pure state , is very easy to work and was probably the first metal used by humans. Today, most of the gold that is newly mined or recycled is used in the manufacture of jewellery. About 78 % of the gold used each year is used in the manufacture of jewellery. B ecause gold is highly valued and in very limited supply it has long been used as a medium of exchange or money. The first known use of gold in transactions dates back about 6 000 years . Early transactions were done using pieces of gold or pieces of silver. The rarity, usefulnes s and desirability of gold make it a substanc e of long-term value. Gold works well for this purpose because it has a high value, and is durable, portable and easily divisible. The first gold coins were minted in Turkey in about 560 BCE. Gold coins were commonly used in transactions up to the early 1900s, when paper currency became a more common form of exchange. Today gold coins are no longer in general use for financial transactions. T he most important industrial use of gold is in the manufacture of electronics. Gold is a highly efficient conductor that can carry tiny current s !

They can choose any jewellery , for example, ring, earrings, beads, bangles, etc. The flow chart should explain the process of getting and using gold to making a piece of jewellery that is ready for sale. For example: First point: 'Gold in the ground is extracted as ore.' To the last point: 'The gold (rings/beads/earrings) are transported to jewellery shops for sale.' The groups should try to think as many possible stages in the flow chart as possible, and then draw their flow chart on a large piece of paper (e.g. a two-page spread in the notebook).

Ask learners to read the information on Learner's Book page 48 and then as a class discuss what they know about work and exploitation. Ask them questions. Point out the Flash Facts box. Read the caption under the photograph. It is important to know the difference between child labour that exploits children and work that does them no harm. Some types of work are not acceptable for children. Child labour is illegal under 15 years. Child work at any age is wrong when: - The child is too young for the job - The job is unsafe or harmful - I t stops the child from going to school - I t takes the child away from her or his family - The child is forced to work - The pay is unfair - The child is treated unfairly Introduce and talk about the Fairtrade organisation and Fairtrade label or logo (Learner' s Book page 49), then ask learners to work in groups of 5 to read the information on Learner' s Book page 49 and do the Activity . Go around to groups while they are discussing to help and informally assess. You will need the A3 sheets of paper for the groups to draw their posters for the Activity . Remind the groups to first design the poster on another piece of paper. If learners have pencil crayons, kokis and crayons they should colour their posters. Ask groups to put up their posters on the classroom walls; the class should decide which 2 posters are most effective. Ask for someone from each group to read their list (Question 2 of the Activity on Learner' s Book page 49) to the class. Write the common points on the board.

Ask learners to work in pairs for the Activity on Learner's Book page 50: Question 1: drawing the chocolate bar, Question 2: 'dividing it up' (using the list in the Learner's Book), reading Question 3, and then joining another pair to discuss the Group question. Ask the groups to report back to the class about their discussion, and as a class discuss the question to decide what most learners feel about the question of fairness. Next, ask learners to work quietly to read the information on Learner's Book page 51 and think about the question in the Activity. Then discuss the Activity as a class: ask learners to give examples and talk about how cocoa farmers have benefited from fair trading - how Fairtrade has made a difference to their lives. Bright idea! Ask learners to look out for the Fairtrade label or logo on products at supermarkets and health shops. The F airtrade Label The FAIRTRADE label or logo (on Learner' s Book page 49) is now the most widely recognised and trusted ethical label in the world. When a product carries the Fairtrade Label, it means that both producers and traders have met Fairtrade Standards and that they are audited annually to ensure compliance. The symbol in the Fairtrade Label shows a person with a raised arm represen ting the optimism of producers . The blue sky of potential is connected to the green of growth. Fairtrade is an alternative approach to conven tional trade and a global movement that stands for sustainability and development through trade. Dating back to the 1960s, Fairtrade start ed with small initiatives by individuals or groups (usually faith-based organisations or social entrepreneurs ) that wanted to make a differenc e in developing countries by buying their products in an ethical manner. This included paying fairer prices and establishing direct trading partnership s with producers , therefore sharing knowledge and information on production and market and quality requirement s. Now Fairtrade has become the leading certification syst em for sustainability and povert y alleviation. There are thousands of Fairtrade certified companies in the world (producer organisations, manufacturer s and traders) that make a differenc e every day through Fairtrade trading. Fairtrade create s more opportunities for those farming communities who have been economically disadvant aged or marginalised by the conven tional trading syst em. Fairtrade benefits small-scale farmers and farm workers by: ensuring better trading, working and living conditions through Fairtrade Standards providing a Fairtrade Premium that small-scale farmers (in the case of a co-operative) and farm workers (in the case of a commercial farm) can invest in projects to improve their lives supporting sustainable production and protection of the environment for a better future.

Remind lear ners to support their opinions with reasons and examples. Workers need to be protected from exploitation because unfortunately there are people and companies who will exploit them, especially workers in poorer countries. When workers are exploited the company may make more profit, but the worker and her or his family suffer from the unfair trade relationship. 2.List should include: Assists farmers in getting better trading and working conditions. Assists farmers by setting up co-operatives. Lobbies for companies to pay better prices, and to always pay at least market price.

They should decide how the chocolate pieces should be divided amongst the 5 groups/people involved in making a bar of chocolate: farmers, government of the country where the farmers farm, company that makes chocolate, shop owner who sells chocolate, government of the country where the chocolate is sold. Ask each pair to draw squares in their notebooks to show how many pieces they think should go to each group. 3.Reading information and data handling.

Write the following words on the board to help learners: ov ercast, scorching, fine, cloudy, wet and windy; ask for volunteers to give more words about the weather - add them to your list on the board. Ask the pairs to write the weather words in their notebooks, and then talk about the questions in the Activity . As a class, briefly revie w and discuss the questions from 'What do you know already?' on Learner' s Book page 55. This will give you a good indication of what learners know and remember about weather, climate and vegetation from Grade 5. This Unit should not be difficult or challenging for learners if they achieved the content and skills for Geography in Grade 5. Ask for volunteers to explain the difference between weather and climate; write the definition of each word on the board. Ask learners to work in groups to read the information on Learner' s Book page 56 and then complete the Activity on the same page. Learners should stay in their groups to continue reading about 'Seasons' on Learner' s Book page 57, and then work on their own to do the Activity on the same page. Draw the table from Learner's Book page 56 on the board and ask for volunteers to fill in the correct answers. Guide learners in marking their own work. Then discuss the pictures and questions on Learner' s Book page 57.

Weather and Climate Q & A What is the difference between weather and climate?Climate is the av erage we ather for a par ticular region and time period (usually tak en ov er a 30- year period). Climate is not the same as we ather; rather, it is the av erage pat tern of we ather for a par ticular region. We ather describe s the short -term st ate of the atmospher e. The we ather is just the stat e of the atmospher e at any time, including things such as temper ature, precipitation, air pres sure and cloud cov er. Daily changes in the weather are due to winds and st orms. Se asonal changes are due to the Ear th ro tating around the sun. What c auses weather? Because the Ear th is round and not flat, the Sun 's ra ys don't fall ev enly on the land and oce ans. The Sun shines more directly near the equator , bringing thes e are as more warm th. How ever, the polar regions are at such an angle to the Sun that they get little or no sunlight during the winter , causing colder temper atures. The se diff erences in temper ature creat e a re stless mov ement of air and wat er in gre at swirling curr ents that distribut e heat energy from the Sun acro ss the planet . When air in one region is warmer than the surrounding air, it become s les s dense and begins to rise , dra wing more air in underneath. Else where, cooler denser air sinks, pushing air outw ard to flow along the surfac e and comple te the cy cle. Why do mountains affect weather and climate?There are tw o sides to a mount ain: wa yward and leew ard. When it rains , the wa yward side get s the rain. As a cloud goes up the mount ain, it keep s raining until there is no more wat er in the cloud. Now , as the cloud st arts to go down the other side of the mount ain, there is no more precipit ation, so the leew ard side of the mount ain doesn 't get any rain. The flat ground on this side of the mount ain is dry. W hat is climate change? Climate change is a change in long-term we ather pat terns. The y can become warmer or colder . Annual amount s of rain fall or snowf all can increas e or decre ase. What is global warming?Global warming re fers to an av erage incre ase in the Ear th's temper ature, which in turn caus es changes in climate .

When scientists talk about the issue of climate change, their concern is about global warming caused by human activities. What is the greenhouse ef fect? The greenhouse effect is the rise in temperatur e that the Earth experiences because certain gases in the atmosphere like water vapour, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane trap energy from the sun. Without these gases, heat would escape back into space and the Earth' s average temperatur e would not be warm enough for humans to live. But if the greenhouse effect becomes stronger, it could make the Earth warmer than usual. What is El Ni\u00f1o? El Ni\u00f1o is a climate pattern where the water in the Pacific Ocean near the equator gets hotter than usual and affects the atmosphere and weather around the world. El Ni\u00f1o climate conditions occur every few years , and they are not predictable. El Ni\u00f1o is Spanish for 'the little boy'. What is La Ni\u00f1a?La Ni\u00f1a is the opposite of El Ni\u00f1o. During a La Ni\u00f1a, the water in the same area along the equator gets colder than usual. This, too, affects weather around the globe. Accor ding to scientist s, La Ni\u00f1a cycles generally create a more active hurricane season in the Atlantic. La Ni\u00f1a is Spanish for 'the little girl'. Where does the wind blo w the most ... and the least? The windiest place on Earth is Port Martin, in Antarctic a. Here winds average more than 64 km per hour on at least 100 days every year. The place with the least wind is also in Antarctic a, at a site called Dome A. Here the wind hardly blows at all. This shows how Antarctic a is a place of extremes. W here is weather recorded? Weather stations are found all over the world. The highest one on land is on Mount Evere st.

In this Unit you'll explore the region of tropical rainforests. Ask learners to tell you what they already know about rainforests. Ask learners to look at the map on Learner' s Book page 62 and tell you where rainforest regions are found in the world. Talk about the climate in rainforests. Ask learners to work on their own to read the information and do the Activities on Learner' s Book pages 63-64, writing the answers in their notebooks. When learners have completed the work, discuss the answers as a class. These Activities, and the Activity on Learner' s Book page 67, will be useful for informal assessment - identify and help any learners who are struggling with map work and/or data handling. Ask learners to work in pairs to read the information and complete the Activity on Learner' s Book page 65 (in their notebooks), and then team up with another pair to compare answers. Ask for learners to each read a sentence on Learner's Book page 66 aloud, moving around the class so that ever yone gets a chance to read at least 1 sentence. After the reading is complete, go back and talk about the 3 questions in the box es (Learner' s Book page 66). Ask learners to work on their own for the last Activity of the Unit (Learner's Book page 67), writing the answers in their notebooks. Take in the notebooks for informal assessment. Note that: Deforested regions often suffer from soil erosion and then degrade into wastelands. The remo val of trees without sufficient refor estation results in damage to the habitat and loss of biodiversity . The deforestation of tropical rainforests results in the loss of species of plants and animals, and it affects the world' s climate negatively . S&M SS Gr6 10:00 3Bright What is a rainforest? Rainforests are defined and creat ed by rainf all - about 175 cm to 200 cm (2 m) of rainf all per year . You'll find rainf orests in the Amazon Basin; the Congo Basin of equatorial Africa; the East Indies; and from Sumatra to New Guinea. Rainf orests are found in both tropical and temperat e regions - as long as there is enough rain - although there aren't many temperat e rainfor ests. Rainfor ests are in climates which have temperat ures 0 \u00b0C and below - the plant life will not be able to live because they aren't adapted to fros t. All the plants will die out if the rainf orest is cooler. Ho t and wet rainf orest climate is found mostly near the equator. The closer to the equator you are, the more solar radiation there is. The more solar radiation there is, the hott er it is. Becaus e of the ample solar energy, tropical rainf orests are usually warm year round with temperat ures of about 22- 34 \u00b0C, although fore sts at higher elevations , especially cloud fores ts, may be significantly cooler. The temperat ure may fluctuate during the year , but in some equatorial fore sts the aver age may vary as little as 0.3 \u00b0C throughout the year . Temperat ures are generally moderated by cloud cov er and high humidity. T he main plants in this biome are trees . A lot of the rain that falls on the rainf orest never reache s the ground. It sta ys on the trees because the leave s act as a shield, and never gets past the trees to the smaller plants and grounds below. Tree s in this climate can reach a height of more than 50 m. The moistur e of the rainf orest from rainf all, const ant cloud cov er, and transpiration (wat er loss through leav es) creat es intens e local humidity. Large rainf orests (and their humidity) contribut e to the formation of rain clouds, and generate as much as 75 % of their own rain. The Amazon rainfor est is responsible for creating as much as 50 % of its own precipitation. Defore station and climate change may be affecting the water cycle in tropical rainf orests. Since the mid-1990s, rainf orests around the world have experienced periods of sev ere drought , including south-eas t Asia in 1997 and 2005, and the Amazon in 2005. Dry conditions, combined with degradation from logging and agricultur al conv ersion, make fore sts more vulnerable to wildfire . Mos t of Africa' s remaining rainf orests are found in the Congo River Basin on the Atlantic Ocean side of the continen t. Rainf orests in the Congo are mostly under threat from logging, subsist ence activities like small-scale agriculture and firew ood collection, and commercial agricultur e, including large plantations . Wildlife - gorillas, chimpanzee s and elephants - is endangered from hunting. Sources: http://passportt 2012/09/01 10:00 AM39 UNIT 3 MODULE 2Answers to activities Individual Learner's Book page 63 1.

Learners should be able to identify at least 3 similarities and/or differ ences in vegetation between the natural region of their own area and the natural region of a tropical rainforest. 2. For example: A tropical rainforest has a wet, sunny climate and rich natural vegetation. Most of the vegetation is made up of tall trees gro wing close together. The vegetation and climate of a rainforest creates an environment that pro vides enough water, food and shelter for many different species of plants and animals to gro w and live.

Briefly introduce the idea that deserts can be hot or cold. Cold deserts can be cov ered in snow or ice - froz en water which is unavailable to plant life. Based only on the criterion of having less than 25 cm of rain annually, the continent of Antarctica is actually the largest desert on Earth. It has less than 51 mm of rain per year and little or no vegetation. There are barren rock fields in Antarctica that don' t even get snow , even though they' re ver y cold. The Arctic Deser t is the second largest desert in the world. These are polar deserts. The Sahara is the world' s third largest desert, and the largest hot desert. This Unit looks at hot desert regions. Use the Individual Activities in this Unit for informal assessment of learners' progr ess in the Module. Ask learners to work on their own to read Learner' s Book pages 68-70, and write the answers to the Activities in their notebooks. This requir es quiet focused work in class for individual reading, thinking and writing. Ask learners to swap notebooks and mark each other's work for the Activities on Learner' s Book pages 68 and 69. Work through the questions for these Activities with the class, asking for volunteers to answer . Take in the notebooks to informally assess learners' achievement in the 4 Individual Activities for this Unit. Read the text from Bright Idea! aloud to the class. From what they have heard and read, ask learners to work in groups of 4-5 to talk about what it is like to live in a desert. Ask them to talk about aspects such as rain, sun, vegetation and living conditions. Ask learners to work in pairs to read the information on Learner's Book page 71, and to discuss the Activity on the same page. Giv e learners 15 minutes for this task, and then ask for volunteers to tell the class ways in which people have adapted to living in the desert. Try to think of as many aspects as possible, for example: shelter, food and food preparation, clothing, protection from the extreme climate, and access to water. Make a list on the board.

Unpredictable rain fall and def orestation hav e seen the Sahar a Des ert encroach on the hist oric to wn ov er the last fe w ye ars, but now irrigation projects are helping farmer s to fight back. Timbukt u is fort unate to be just a few kilometre s from the massive inland delta of the River Niger, and dra ws wat er from vas t undergr ound aquifer s - bodies of permeable rock which transmit wat er. A women 's co-oper ative in the village of Kab ara, south of Timbuk tu, is using thes e wat er sour ces to plant eucalyp tus tree s. They nurt ure them for tw o ye ars, after which the tree s can then survive almost without rain. In a region where the annual rain fall is les s than 400 mm, re forestation is es sential to put nutrient s back int o the soil, and to pre vent ero sion by the harsh des ert winds. Windbre aks and vegetables Despite some scien tists' conc erns that eucalyp tus tree s can drain large amounts of wat er out of the soil, Daouda Diarra from the World Food Programme in Mali sa ys they are a good choice in the des ert envir onment. 'Eucalyp tus is especially rec ommended for its rapid gro wth and the prot ection it give s against str ong winds, ' Mr Diarra sa ys. 'In dry zone s, a five- year-old tree 's roo t sy stem actually pumps wat er back int o the wat er table .'

Temperate coniferous forests are found: in the Pacific Nor thwest (North America), South America, northw est Eur ope, southern Japan, and the eastern Black Sea-Caspian Sea region. Mostly near the latitude of the Arctic circle. 2. Average rainfall and temperatures for temperate coniferous forest regions Temperatures in January -40 \u00b0C to -2 0 \u00b0C Temper atures in July -2 0 \u00b0C to 0 \u00b0C Annual av erage rain fall >1 000 mmof the ground, which only thaws occasionally. The roots are also shallow because of the poor soil and rock y conditions . Trees in the coniferous forest primarily have needles instead of broad leav es. Needle lea ves are an import ant adapt ation to the extr eme conditions pre sent in the climate of the for est. Pine needles con tain very little sap , so free zing is not much of a problem. Being dark in colour they absorb what little light falls on their surfac es. The vegetation is mostly trees such as fir, pine, redwood, yew and spruce; and some shrubs . Most animals are herbivores; however there are some carnivores and omnivore s. Animals in conif erous for ests include the red fo x, moos e, snowshoe hare , gre at horned owl and cro ssbill. The largest coniferous forest exists in Alaska, Canada, northern Europe and northern Asia, in a ring in the northern hemisphere . This for est is called the Taiga. Mos t of the world' s commer cial so ftwood timber, used for paper , come s from the Taiga. T hreats to these forests Clearcut logging is the biggest threat to the coniferous forest. Replanting after logging leads to single-species conif er monocult ure, which does not cre ate much species biodiver sity. This logging speeds up soil ero sion, ups ets wildlife habitat s and leads to the los s of biodiver sity. Mining operations are a threat to the coniferous forests because of the chemicals used in mining and the silt rele ased by mining. Road construction destroys the forest and also acts as a barrier to wildlife. Ro ads isolat e populations of species from feeding grounds and natural migration rout es, and limits breeding bet ween larger group s thus limiting the gene pool. As the Earth's population continues to increase and people continue to mov e out of the city and int o the suburbs , more and more of thes e fore sts will be los t to urbanis ation.

As long as learners have reasons for their choices, any answer is acceptable. They should also be able to recognise that different people have different reasons for their choices - this will come up in class discussion (learners will hear the different choices and reasons of their peers). Giv e learners 15 minutes for Pair discussion, and then talk about the questions as a class. Write the 3 key terms on the board, and ask learners to read out loud the definitions from Learner' s Book page 80 - write them on the board. Explain the diagrams to learners. They can see population distribution shown on a map on Learner' s Book pages 81 (South Africa) and 90 (the world). Talk about examples or issues related to the key terms. For example, ask learners to tell you whether they agree or disagreed with this statement, and why: 'A n uneven population distribution in a country makes it difficult to distribute resources fairly and evenly.' They should give you reasons for their opinions and give examples if they can; they should also talk about ways in which resour ces can be distributed fairly and evenly . Talk about other examples or issues related to the key terms. For example, what areas in a country tend to have the biggest population size and density, and why? Ask learners to work in pairs to complete the Activities on Learner's Book page 80 and 81 in their notebooks - talking about the questions and then writing their answers. Ask each pair to swap books with another pair and mark their work while you talk through the answers to the Activities on Learner's Book pages 80-81. Ask for volunteers to read aloud sentences from Learner's Book page 82 'The pro vinces: Population size and density', and also to read the ro ws from the tables. Check learners' understanding by asking questions related to the information they have just read, for example, in the tables.

Ask learners to work on their own to complete the Activity on the same page, also in their notebooks. Take in the notebooks for informal assessment of progr ess in all the Activities, and to mark the final Activity . Ask if learners remember anything about the population census from 2011 - talk about this as a class. What is a population census? What information do we get from a population census? How is that information relev ant to Social Sciences studies? (See also Bright Ideas! text below .) Bright idea! What is a population census? A population census , as defined by the United Nations, is: 'the to tal proc ess of analysing and demographic , economic and social data pert aining, at a specified time, to all pers ons in a coun try or a well-de fined par t of the coun try'. A population census is the mos t comple x and massiv e ex ercise e try, mobilising and training a huge number of enumerat ors (c ounters - people who rec ord inf conducting a compr ehensive publicity camp aign, ticipate, collecting individual inf ormation, compiling vas t amount s of comple ted ques tionnaires, and analysing and sharing the data. For many people, the census may be the only time that the st ate re aches them and asks them a ques tion. A population census is typic ally held ev ery 5 ye ars, but becaus e of a lack of cap acity within St atistics South Afric a, it was decided that the time will be ext ended to 10 ye ars. A Communit y Surv ey was conduct ed in the place of the 2006 census . The importance of a population census The census play s an es sential role in public administr ation. The re sults are used to ensure: fairness in distribution of government services; distributing and allocating government funds among regions and districts for education and health servic es; identifying electoral districts at national and local levels; and measuring the impact of industrial development. The census also pro vides the benchmark (r eference point ) for all surve ys conducted by the national st atistical of fice. Without the sampling frame ! S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 51 2012/09/01 10:00 AM52 UNIT 1 MODULE 4obtained by the census, the national statistical system would face difficulties in providing reliable official statistic s for use by government and the public. The census provides information on small areas and population groups with minimum sampling errors. This is important , for example, in planning the location of a school or clinic. Census information is also invaluable for use in the private sector for activities such as business planning and market analyses . The information is used as a benchmark in rese arch and analysis. Hist orical background Prior to the advent of democracy there was no reliable information available about the country as a whole. In 1996 the post- apartheid government conducted its first population census. This was followed by a census in 2001. The next census was scheduled for 2006, but because Statistics South Africa was not in a position to conduct a succes sful census, this was rescheduled for 2011. A Community Survey took the place of the 2006 census. The 2011 Census is the third census conducted by a democratic South African government and forms part of the 2010 round of African censuses , which aim to provide comprehensive data on the continent , for improved planning and to aid development .

Recreational places like beaches and parks are densely populated because people like places where they can relax and have fun. Shopping malls can also have a recreational purpose - for example, going to the movies or having a meal out; as well as a practical purpose - for example, shopping for groceries and things that are needed for the home. Beaches and shopping malls are places that attract people for many reasons, and so they are often crowded. 2.P laces include: parks, fairs and markets, transport/stations, hospitals; and on a bigger scale, many urban areas (cities) are densely populated. 3.Places include: certain natural environments - for example, deserts, polar regions, rainforests, coniferous forests; and social environments - for example, places with low employment, places in economic recession, places without access to services and resources.

There are 2 reasons for this: A large part of the surface area of South Africa is not favourable for habitation because of the Karoo and Kalahari deserts. Historically, settlements grew around trading posts and ports; around mineral deposits and mining; and anywhere that natural resour ces supported settlement and gro wth. Some settlements gre w vastly in wealth and size; as well as in density, and people came from rural areas in search of work. This leaves the rural areas much less densely populated.

Learners should remember information from Grades 4 and 5. Draw the following mind-map on the board (or on a large piece of paper) and add lines with key words and phrases from the class discussion, and also from Learner' s Book pages 85 and 86. Ask learners to copy the mind-map in their notebooks. Climate Resources for human activities Note that while climate, water and mineral resources are not the only influences on global settlement, the strong influence of these factors should be noted on the world population distribution map. This should include cross-r eferencing with maps that show climate, physical features and mineral resour ces. Ask learners to work in pairs to complete the Activities on pages 85 and 86, in their notebooks. Each pair should then join with another pair to swap and mark work (peer assessment), and to agree on answers.

If there is time, read the Bright Idea! case study to learners. It is about a school that nearly 'pays ' for itself: it receiv es little government or community money, and is teaching valuable skills and knowledge that will contribute to the rural community where it is located in South America. Ask learners questions related to the reading: for example, could this approach work at their school (why or why not), and why is it useful to have knowledge and skills to gro w plants? Bright idea! Case study: A rural school that earns its own income The San Fr ancisco Agric ultural School in Par aguay (S outh ) is a high school that co vers ov er 50 % of school co sts by money earned from its own ent erprise activities . It has 120 st udents aged bet ween 16 and 18, who live on campus and do a three ye ar cour se for a high school diploma in agricult ure. The school was st arted in 200 2 and is now nearly self - sufficient, which it means it can nearly support its elf without other funding, which is its aim. The school follo ws a permacult ure appro ach in its organic farming. Permac ulture means 'permanent agricult ure' - it is a par ticular appro ach to designing and gro wing plant s (and animals) in a sust ainable wa y that car es for the ear th and for people, while still producing needed re sults. The goal of the San Fr ancisco Agric ultural School is to ensure that st udents learn the basic s of agricult ure and live stock management , including knowing about dise ases and pes ts, equipment , administr ation and basic finance s. In addition to thes e skills, st udents should also acquir e value s and principles such as re sponsibility and hones ty, to car e about natur e and their cult ure. The school' s ent erprises earn money and are a place for the st udents to learn and practis e both technic al and entr epreneurial skills. A good example of this is the school' s fre sh vege table busines s: Students do organic farming in the fields, develop their agriculture skills, and rein force the theory they learn in the classr oom. Then each week students take their harvest to the local market for sale. Dealing with cus tomers, making sale s, and marke ting helps st udents to develop busines s skills. Studen ts are inv olved in all aspects of the busines s, including keeping recor ds of inputs and yields. The Head of Agric ultural Production (an agronomist and te acher) is the pers on finally re sponsible for leading the enterpris e. (An agronomis t is someone who st udies soil management and crop production.)! S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 56 2012/09/01 10:00 AM57 UNIT 2 MODULE 4Here are the main features of the school: Strong and entrepreneurial leadership; Good administration and good financial management; Detailed record keeping (from which good management decisions can be made); Passion, innovation and experimentation; and Permaculture farming - the school integrates this design approach into its learning and farming tasks to teach student s about sustainable living.

If there is time, introduce and talk about the problem of cholera in some densely populated places in the world - usually where there are poor conditions (e.g. no access to sanitation services; low levels of education about health and life skills). - Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal disease. It affects both children and adults and can kill within hours. - Ther e are an estimated 3-5 million cholera cases and 100 000- 120 000 deaths due to cholera ever y year . S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 60 2012/09/01 10:00 AM61 UNIT 3 MODULE 4- Yet cholera is an easily treatable disease - up to 80 % of people can be treated successfully through oral rehy dration salts (a mix of salt, sugar and clean water). - It is also easy for people to protect themselves from cholera if they know the relev ant information and education. See the text in Bright Idea! for information, and photocopiable resources for learners in the Extra resour ces section. Bright idea! Populations at risk What is cholera? Cholera is inf ected by: drinking water or eating food that is infected with the bacteria; and poor sanitation and personal and domestic hygiene practices. Sympt oms include sudden diarrhoea with pro fuse, wat ery st ools, vomiting, suppres sion of urine, rapid se vere dehy dration, fall of blood pre ssure, cramps in legs and abdomen, subnormal temper ature, and comple te collaps e. Death may occ ur within 24 hours unles s quick medical tre atment is given to the patien t. Why is choler a a global problem? Cholera remains a global thre at to public health and a ke y indicat or of lack of social dev elopment. Rec ently, the re-emer gence of cholera has been noted in par allel with the ev er-increasing size of vulnerable populations living in unsanitary conditions. The number of cholera case s report ed to the World Health Organiz ation (WHO) con tinues to rise . Fr om 2004 to 2008, case s incre ased by 24 % comp ared with the period from 2000 to 2004 . For 2008 alone, a to tal of 190 130 cas es wer e repor ted from 56 coun tries, including 5 143 deaths . In Afric a in 2010 there wer e 115 106 repor ted case s, and 3 39 7 deaths . Many cas es are not repor ted due to limitations in monitoring sy stems and fe ar of trade and tra vel sanctions . The true burden of the dise ase is es timated to be 3-5 million cas es and 100 000-12 0 000 deaths annually. Choler a epidemics Cholera occ urs in epidemic form when there is rapid urbanis ation without adequate sanit ation and acc ess to clean drinking wat er. For this re ason, the foc us of epidemics has shifted to dev eloping coun tries ov er the last cent ury. Other risk fact ors include poor hy giene, ov ercrowded living conditions and a lack of saf e food prep aration and handling. Unst able political and envir onmental conditions such as war s, famine s and floods that lead to displaced populations and the bre akdown of infr astructure are very import ant risk fact ors for cholera. Cholera pre vention Adequate wat er supply and sanit ation are basic requir ements for life . People living in high-risk are as can pro tect themselv es by follo wing a fe w simple rules of good hy giene and saf e food prep aration.

As well as the improv ement of water supplies, people must be advised through health education of the sourc es of their diseas e problems and how to avoid them. Primary health care education is a vital component in the prev ention of cholera. Ac cess to clean water Access to clean water and improv ed sanitation facilities is a fundamental human right. Yet , in many developed and developing countrie s, water quality shows continued deterior ation and in many case s water sourc es are depleted. Thes e eff ects are a function of increasing population pressur e, agricultur al misuse and the inability to keep pace with the increasing demands on the res ource. A bett er underst anding of the socio- economic , environmen tal and public health consequenc es of water supply and sanitation related diseas es may help the public and policy makers understand the value of microbiologically safe water as well as improv ed sanitation facilities . In developing countrie s where res ources may be inadequate, partic ularly in rural communities , basic hygiene education and sanitation programme s can be used to improv e human health. The need for safe drinking water as well as adequate sanitation binds all of humanity into a single, global community . Sources: 3 MODULE 4Individual Learner's Book page 92 1. and 2. Complete table.

Background Information From 900 ACE on, societies in the interior of southern Africa increasingly became part of a much wider world through trade, commerce and cultural exchange. This module focuses on Mapungubwe, its internal structure and its trade within Africa and across the Indian Ocean. Mapungubwe was a complex society of much larger political scale than had been seen before in southern Africa. There were changes in political power, leadership and authority and in organising, managing and maintaining that political power. It is important to understand Mapungubwe in its historical context. This module therefore starts with a brief overview of settlements in the Limpopo Valley before Mapungubwe, and concludes with a brief overview of Great Zimbabwe, which succeeded Mapungubwe as the centre of southern African trade. Further context is provided in the final unit, which looks at the travels of Marco Polo, as an example of a European explorer in Asia at the time when Mapungubwe was at the height of its power. Contextualising Mapungubwe provides a useful comparison of societies across some parts of the world in the same time period, and the opportunity to expand ideas about change and technological, social and political innovation.

Giv e the groups a few minutes to talk about the concept of 'kingdom' and take feedback. Remind learners that in Grade 5 they learned about how people in southern Africa lived during the Later Stone Age. Ask learners to remind you how the San lived together - how their society was organised. Tell them that this year they will 'fast-forward' through time and move further north to look at how people lived about 1 000 years ago, in the Limpopo Valley. Tell learners to look at the map on page 98 of their Learner's Books, and show them the Limpopo Valley on your map of Africa. Read through the text for Unit 1 with the learners. Make sure that they grasp the concept of a hierarchy - a form of organisation that is arranged in levels, from top to bottom, or high to low . People who are at the top of a hierarchy usually have more pow er or control than people who are low er down in the hierarchy. Ask learners to explain the word 'trade ', or to look it up on page 179 if they don' t know what it means. Talk briefly about what was traded and why, so that learners develop a picture of all the activities of people at this time (i.e. where does ivor y come from? And gold? What did people do with the ivor y and the gold?) Ask learners how people became powerful (they owned more land and cattle, therefor e could trade more and own more) to ensure that they grasp the connection between wealth and pow er. Make sure too that they understand why it was important for the chief or king to control economic activities - point out that it is economic activities, the work that people do, that create wealth and therefor e pow er. You might like to ask learners how this hierarchical organisation of society compares with how San society was organised (the San were far less hierarchical, and all things wer e meant to be shared equally among the group). Let learners work in pairs to do the Activity on page 99. They should write the answers individually in their notebooks. Take brief feedback to go ov er the answers.

Some interesting points about kingdoms in the world today Monarchies, in which the head of state is usually a king or a queen (the monarch), wer e the mos t common form of social organis ation right int o the 19th cen tury. Usually, but not always, monarchs are succeeded by the eldest son (or sometime s daught er). Most countries have abolished their monarchies, but some still exist. Nowadays, most monarchies are constitutional monarchies, i.e. the monarch play s a cer emonial role , but has no direct political pow er. The se countrie s are there fore fully democratic. The United Kingdom is the most obvious example of a constitutional democracy , but there are se veral other s on the Eur opean con tinent (e. g. Denmark, the Netherlands , Spain and Belgium ), in Eas t Asia (e .g. Thailand and Japan ), on our own con tinent (Le sotho and Moroc co) and Jordan in the Middle Eas t. However, some absolute monarchies still exist - the Vatican is an absolut e monarch y, as are Sw aziland and Saudi Arabia, among other countrie s. Source: Wikipedia 2011! Informal assessment Pair Activity page 99: Have learners made the connection between wealth and pow er? Can they extr act rele vant tions? Do learner s' answ ers show that they can distinguish the fe atures of a monarch y from thos e of a democrac y? Remedial and extension activities Remedial learners: Ask learners to write five sentences to describe what life was like in a kingdom about 1 000 years ago. E xtension learners: Let learners imagine that they are a ver y pow erful chief in the Limpopo Valley. They are ver y old, and know that soon their son will take ov er pow er. They want to make sure that their son is a successful and good ruler , so they write down five important things or 'rules ' for a good chief to always remember .

Activity Tell learners that they are going to find out about the beginnings of bigger and more pow erful settlements in the Limpopo Valley. Let them look at the map on page 100 in the Learner' s Book, and find Schroda and K2. Ask learners if they can think of any reasons why people would choose that area in which to build their settlement (the river pro vides water and the land would be fertile). Let learners read the text on pages 100-101 quietly. Show the learners the Arabic, Swahili (East Africa), Indian and Indonesian areas on the world map, so that they grasp how far-ranging trade activity was at this time. Talk briefly about what archaeologists do (a learner can look up the word in a dictionary and read out the meaning to the class, if necessary) and the important role they play in finding out about our history . Read out key sentences of the text to explain and summarise the key content and concepts for this unit. Read the Activity on page 101 with the class. Help them to imagine what archaeologists working at the K2 midden would do, how carefully they would examine objects and most importantly , what questions they would ask about each. Then let learners work in pairs to discuss the answers. Each learner should copy and complete the table in their notebook. Bright idea! Archaeologists of 2150 To help learners grasp how archaeologists work, you might like to bring to class a collection of any old items and brok en piece s of items you can find - or you could ask learner s to bring some to class (e .g. par t of the insides of an old comput er, a disc arded cell phone, brok en pot tery, an old shoe, a brok en to y, et c). Learners imagine that they are archaeologists in the year 2150, digging and inv estigating in the are a where they now live . The se are the arte facts (object s or things) they hav e dug up. The class could work in groups to examine the collection, and draw conclusions about what each item tells us about socie ty early in the 21st cen tury.!

Learners may well come up with a number of other ideas, and may relate technology, or how advanced the methods were of making things, to jewellery and household artefacts rather than weapons. They could also include pieces of rock and other materials that would indicate what dwellings were made of. Decorations on artefacts might give clues about the society's religious beliefs, and so on. Note also that it is very important to allow different reasonable interpretations of the 'evidence' found in the K2 midden, since this demonstrates how we come to have differing versions of events in history.Item What it tells us about the inhabitants of K2 Bones of human beings; teeth; skulls What they looked like, e.g. how tall they were Piec es of jewellery they wore , like necklaces or bracele ts and earrings made from gold, ivory, copper, beads, etc.T he things they were made from show what natural resour ces they had and who they probably traded with. How they were made would show what kind of skills the K2 inhabitant s had. Animal bones, skulls, teeth W hat they ate; the animals they farmed with; wild animals they had to prot ect themselve s against; the animals they hunted Old pieces of weapons like spears or arrows What these were made of and the methods used would tell us about how advanced their technology was, e.g melting and beating things into shapes, decorations on them, etc. Piec es of pots and other things they used every dayThe se would give us clues about their every day lives , e .g. how they cooked and stor ed food. Informal assessment Pair Activity page 101: Can learners identify historical sources? Can they draw reas onable and logical conclusions from these sourc es? Additional resources For the Bright Idea! Activity: a collection of any old items, and broken pieces of items you can find - or you could ask learners to bring some to class (e.g. part of the insides of an old computer, a discarded cell phone, broken pottery, an old shoe, a broken toy, plastic bottles, cooldrink tins, polystyrene 'takeaway' cartons or cups, and so on) kings.php S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 72 2012/09/01 5Remedial and extension activities Remedial learners: Give learners a piece of paper that they can fold in half to create two columns, or let them draw a line down the middle of the page in their notebooks. In the right hand column, they list all the things the people of Schroda and K2 had to trade. In the left hand column, they list the things they 'bought' or 'imported'. E xtension learners could investigate how people become archaeologists: what, where and for how long they study, and where they work when they are qualified.

Activity, you will need photocopies of the 'A ppeal to save Mapungub we' (Extra resources) for each learner group . Start by finding out what learners already know about Mapungubw e - they may be familiar with the famous golden rhinoceros. If you have managed to collect brochur es or pictures, show them to the class. Read the introductory paragraph on page 102 with the learners and read through the Activity with them. You may need to explain that 'v enerated' means (to see something as sacred or special), and 'molten ' means 'melted '. Giv e the learners a few minutes to do the Activity in groups, then briefly discuss the answers as a class. Read the text on pages 102-103 of the Learner's Book with the learners. Ask them to explain why the people saw the king' s leadership as sacred, and make sure they understand the king' s role as intermediary (messenger) between ordinar y people and their god. Let learners examine the picture on page 103 and identify the palace. Let them look at the photograph on page 104 as well, to get a real sense of what the hill looks like in its surrounding landscape. Ask learners for their opinions about why the king built his palace at the top of the hill. Would this affect how the people regar ded him? Talk about the stone walls of the palace for a few minutes - how would they have been built? What do they think the ordinar y people thought about the king' s palace? Ask learners to read the text on page 104 quietly to themselves. Let learners tell you the main points of each paragraph (limit this S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 74 2012/09/01 10:00 AM75 UNIT 3 MODULE 5to two points for the first two paragraphs, and three for the final paragraph). Let learners work in groups to do the Activity on page 105. Mov e among them while they are busy and help or contribute as necessary - make sure they understand that if something is 'taboo', it means that it is forbidden, not allow ed. Ask learners to write their answers to Question 1 in their notebooks (they could also do this for homewor k). Ask learners to remind you how society was organised and how wealth (trade goods) was distributed at the time of the Zhizo people in Schroda. Ho w did this change in K2 society? (If learners can't remember , refer them to page 101 of the Learner' s Book). Explain that leaders in Mapungubwe continued and expanded the K2 tradition, so that Mapungub we became the first class-based society in South Africa. Briefly explain 'class-based ' if learners are puzzled by this. Read the text on page 106 of the Learner' s Book with learners (or ask a confident reader to read it to the class). Explain any words the learners find difficult. Ask learners to examine the diagram on page 106. See if they can draw parallels between how society was organised, and the physical arrangement of the town. Drawing on the text and the diagram, learners do Question 1 of the Activity on page 106 individually, in their notebooks. This is a ver y good opportunity to check the learners' progr ess, so circulate to assess their work informally, noting learners who need remedial work. Let learners discuss Question 2 in small groups. Again, circulate, and interv ene gently where you find one or two learners dominating the discussion, and ask shyer or quieter learners questions to draw them into the discussion. Remind learners about the Heritage Trail they did in the last term of Grade 5, and ask them what they can remember about Mapungubw e. Let them discuss what they remember of the golden objects, then read the text on page 107 of the Learner' s Book with the class. Tell learners to work in pairs to discuss their answers to the Activity on page 107. They should write their answers individually, in their notebooks. Remind the learners that they are historians, and historians often have different interpretations of the same thing, so the answers in their notebooks do not have to be exactly the same as their partner 's answers. Tell learners to look at the map on page 108 of the Learner's Book. Let them work in pairs to find the trading centres and trace the trade routes. Have a class discussion about the trade routes, and talk about how the traders would have travelled, how long their journeys would have taken them, what they would have eaten, where they would have slept, and so on. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 75 2012/09/01 10:00 AM76 UNIT 3 MODULE 5 Let the learner pairs read the text on page 108 quietly together, then discuss their answers to the Activity . They should write their answers individually, in their notebooks. Ask learners to tell you what they know about World Heritage Sites. Remind learners what we mean by 'heritage': things and places of value that we have from our past and that we want to look after so that we can pass them on to future generations. These can be of cultural value, like Mapungub we and Robben Island, or of natural value, like the Cape Floral Region. Read the text on page 109 of the Learner's Book with the class. Let them do the Activity in groups. After a few minutes, tell the groups to join up with another group and share their ideas. Answers to activities Group, Learner's Book page 102 1. There are no wr ong or right answers to this question. The purpose of it is to get learners thinking about how we find out about the past and how much of it is about piecing together the evidence we can find. 2. Place of jackals - there wer e many jackals in the area, which would give you clues about vegetation and other wildlife in the area that jackals would eat; place of venerated stone - that it is a stony place and that there is something special or valuable to do with the stone; place of wisdom - that wise people lived there, or maybe that it was a religious place with the wise people being priests; place where molten rock flow ed - a place where people melted substances like metals which they found in the rocks (such as gold or iron). G roup, Learner' s Book page 105 1. M apungubwe gre w big because: it was a good place to keep cattle and gro w crops, there was plenty of water and it was a healthy place to live and bring up your family; people from other countries travelled past and you could trade goods with them; there were wild animals to hunt for meat and skins, and for ivory which you could trade;Bright idea! Make copies of the 'Appeal to save Mapungubwe' (Extra resources) for each learner group . Ask learner groups to read the appeal together, then ask a few leading questions to make sure they unders tand what the issue is. Let the groups brainstorm the possible consequences of mining in a valuable heritage are a.

Note that learners may come up with other v ery good reasons. 2. a) The legends probably grew around the fact that the king and his family lived on top of the mountain and people believed that the king had great spiritual pow ers. They believed that the king made it rain, which was ver y important for the health of the people, their animals and their crops. They possibly also believed that the king had other pow ers, such as creating good or bad luck. The king would also have had pow erful friends and pow erful enemies; there may have been plots to murder the king or the queen, and so on. This is a sample answer; any answ ers learners can support to make them plausible, are acceptable. Individual and Gr oup Learner' s Book page 106 1. (I ndividual) (1) The king and his family lived on the top of the mountain. The elite lived on the low er slopes of the mountain and other small hilltops. The commoners lived on the flat land around the bottom of the hill. (2) The king lived in a in a stone- walled palace and the elite lived in houses surrounded by stone enclosures. The commoners lived in clay huts. (3) The king and the elite wer e rich and ate better food than the commoners, who were poor. (4) Rich people wer e buried at the top of the mountain and the elite wer e buried in the hills and they probably had many funeral traditions. The commoners would have been buried on the flat land at the bottom of the mountain and the hills, and their funeral traditions would have been ver y simple. (Learners ' answers should include any three of the above.) 2. (Group) There ar e no wrong or right answers to this question. What is important is that learners can support their opinions with good reasons, and that they are willing to listen to, and allow the opinions of others. Pair Learner' s Book page 107 1. Any five of the following: gold bangles, gold beads, necklace of gold beads and cowrie shells, objects cov ered in gold foil, a golden bowl, a golden sceptre, a golden rhino. 2. The cowrie shells probably came from coastal countries to the east of the Limpopo Valley, e.g. Mozambique and Kenya. 3.

Mapungubw e Cultural Landscape was declared a World Heritage Site because it provides evidence about the biggest kingdom in southern Africa, and it also shows a lot about trade (who traded and what they traded) and provides evidence of how the trade routes of the time crossed continents. 2. Threats to World Heritage Sites would include theft, people picking flowers or digging up plants where they are not allowed to do so, and natural disasters like fires, floods, or drought. Constant wind could cause erosion and the sun could fade things like drawings on rocks.

In their report, they should list the five objects they have found, and write a sentence saying what they think each object tells us about society and life in Mapungubw e almost 1 000 years ago. Extension: Learners could role play interviews between an archaeologist in the 21st century and a group of people who lived in Mapungubw e in the 13th century. The archaeologist has found a number of items and would like more information about what they are, what they are used for, how they are made, and so on.

To give learners an idea of how big this is, compare it with the number of learners in your school - if there are 200 learners, then Gr eat Zimbab we was 100 times bigger than your school. Ask learners to tell you what was similar and what was different between Mapungub we and Zimbab we (for example, the elite of Great Zimbab we, like the elite of Mapungub we, lived in a special area away from the commoners and this area was also enclosed by stone walls, but whereas Mapungub we flourished for about half a century, Gr eat Zimbab we flourished for much longer than that.)

Tell learners they are to imagine that they are the young Marco Polo of the 13th cent ury, and this time he is trav elling through Africa. He comes across many wild creat ures he has never seen in his life befor e. In their groups, learners study the pictures and work out how Marco Polo would describe the creat ure they have chosen. Remind them that he would describe the creat ure in terms that his people at home in Italy in the 13th cent ury would underst and (so , for example , he wouldn't compare the height of a giraff e to a skys craper, because there were no skyscr apers in the 13th cent ury!).

Background information The focus of this module is on changes in Europe that enabled Europeans to explore other parts of the world, and their early exploration of the southern African coast . It is important to note that the European Renaissance occurred at the same time as when the Kingdom of Great Zimbabwe was at the height of its powers . At this stage in European history, Europeans knew very little about Africa. The y began to explore our continent only about 600 years ago. The impact that Europe had later on the continent of Africa will be studied in Grade s 7, 8 and 9. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 87 2012/09/01 10:00 AMUNIT 1 MODULE 6 88 Unit 11Unit The European Renaissance Learner's Book pages 118-119 2 hours Curriculum content and concepts A turning point in European history Began as a cultural movement in Italy Rejection of ideas and attitudes of the Middle Ages The Age of Humanity: the importance of science, learning, freedom and the rights of individuals Teaching notes You will need: photocopies of the peer assessment sheet (Extra resources); large sheets of paper, old magazines, glue, scissors, coloured crayons or pencils. Let learners work in groups to discuss the questions in 'What do you know already?' on page 117 in the Learner's Book. Use this discussion to talk about what learners will be finding out about in this module: travellers in the 15th century and the changes brought about by what they discovered, learned and brought back to Europe. You could briefly talk about each of the questions the learners have just been discussing, in relation to these 15th century travellers. Ask learners if anyone can explain what 'renaissance' means. If nobody knows, ask a learner to read out the definition on page 118 in the Learner's Book (Flash Fact) and another learner to read out the explanation given on page 179 of the Learner's Book. If you combine the two definitions, you get a fairly good answer to the key question on page 118: What was the European Renaissance? Tell learners to read the text on page 118 quietly to themselves. Discuss the text with the class, making sure that they have grasped the main points. Let learners find Italy on the world map, as well as the other countries mentioned in the text. Make sure that learners can also show you on the map, roughly where the Roman Empire was. Ask learners if they can think of any reasons why the Middle Ages were also called the Dark Ages. Remind learners that historians look at available evidence from which they draw conclusions to develop stories or theories about what happened in the past. That is exactly what they will do now, in thinking about the questions in the Activity on page 118. Brainstorm ideas with the class, summarising them on the board or a flipchart. Read and discuss the text and the pictures on page 119 of the Learner's Book. Then ask learners to close their books and summarise for you the main changes that made the Renaissance S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 88 2012/09/01 10:00 AM89 UNIT 1 MODULE 6 possible (better education created a desire for new knowledge and ideas and a love of learning; new technologies made printing lots of copies of books possible, so more people were reading and learning; new technology made travelling bigger distances possible; as people travelled and brought new things home with them, a desire for those things was created and so trade between countries started; a desire to spread the Christian religion). Explain the Activity on page 119 in the Learner's Book to the class and let them choose a topic. Before they start, discuss how they will find the information they need, and hand out copies of the assessment sheet to each group so that they know what they are working towards. Tell learners to do the research and plan their posters for homework. Let learners create their posters and present them to the class. Using their copies of the peer assessment sheet (see Extra resources) learners can assess one another's posters. Answers to activities Class Learner's Book page 1181. You may need to give lear ners a few clues to start them off: look at where Italy is on the map of the world, for example to demonstrate that they have a lot of coastline and so would be a seafaring nation; they are close to the Middle East so travel between Europe and Asia would definitely involve passing through Italy, which would have led to sharing knowledge and ideas, the creation of trade and thus wealth. You could also point out that a large part of Italy's heritage is the Roman Empire, and people might have become more interested in their heritage and begun to study its history. 2. Answers should include some of the follo wing, and learners may come up with other equally valid ideas: peaceful conditions, allowing people time to engage in more than simply survival activities; this in turn would allow for the growth of an economy; a stable and growing economy would mean that people would become wealthier and able to buy new products, so trade would flourish; as people become wealthier, they often have more leisure time and therefore the time to read and become educated, to create and enjoy art and music, and the time and money to travel; access to waterways and ports would be important for trade routes; a temperate climate would encourage travellers to visit, resulting in more sharing of knowledge, ideas and resources. Group Learner's Book page 1191. Let learners assess one another' s work, using the assessment sheet (make copies of Extra resources page). Do make sure that their work is factually accurate, and correct any inaccuracies.

Five interesting facts about the European Renaissance'. Extension learners could find out more about Johannes Gutenberg and the printing press. Alternatively, they could imagine that they are a member of a wealthy merchant class family living in Florence during the Renaissance period. They have just finished entertaining some very interesting travellers from the East, and are now going to write a letter to a friend or relative in France, telling them all about the visitors.Informal assessment Assess learners' participation in and contributions towards the Group Activit y on page 119.

Read and discuss the text and pictures about da Vinci on page 120 of the Learner's Book. If you have access to books with pictures of da Vinci's drawings and paintings, let learners examine and comment on them. Read through the first two questions of the Activity on page 120, and if you think most of the words in question 2 will be new to the learners, tell them to choose three words to look up (or assign words to learners yourself). Explain to the learners how they will work: start by drawing their flying machines, and while they are doing that, they can take turns to access the dictionaries to look up the words they don't know. Before they start, help them to think about their flying machine designs: what is the purpose of the flying machine: e.g. is it to transport people to other continents, to other planets, or perhaps they might want to design a car that turns into a flying machine when you want to get out of a traffic jam? Or perhaps it is a little flying machine that you can use to cross wide roads or rivers where there are no bridges? Unit 12UnitLeonardo da Vinci and Galileo Galilei Learner's Book 120-121 hours S&M SS 2012/09/01 10:00 AM92 UNIT 2 MODULE 6Encourage learners to be inventive, pointing out that that was what made da Vinci such a great man. Thinking about a purpose for their machine will help them to decide how big it should be, what it should be made of, and so on. Let learners work individually on the first two questions of the Activity. They should write the meanings of the words in their notebooks, but you may like them to do their drawings on blank sheets of paper. Learners should discuss the third question of the Activity in their groups. A tip for the learners is to look up the defining things about the Renaissance on page 118 of their Learner's Books - this might help them frame their answer to the question. Ask learners to write their answers individually in their notebooks. Throughout the time they are busy with this Activity, circulate to assess informally and help as needed. Ask learners to read the text on page 121 of the Learner's Book quietly to themselves. Then work together with the class to find the key sentences or main points in the text. Let learners read the key sentences aloud. Make sure they understand what heresy means, and why Galileo was placed under house arrest for life. Explain to learners that during the Renaissance people returned to studying the works of the Ancient Greek and Roman scholars. Ask a learner to reread the first paragraph of the text on page 121 of the Learner's Book. Tell them that they are going to conduct Galileo's experiment which proved Aristotle's theory wrong. Point out that people had believed Aristotle's theory for over 2 000 years, and that nobody had ever tested the theory! Galileo's experiment therefore also proved that theories in physics must be tested to make sure that they are true and right. If you have made copies of the experiment worksheets, hand them out to each learner group and go through it with them making sure they understand what to do. If you don't have copies of the worksheets, write the table up on the board for the learners to copy into their notebooks. Use the worksheet to tell learners what to do. Make sure that learners choose sturdy chairs to stand on - you don't want anyone to fall! Ensure that they are all working with balls of differing mass. Give the learners a few minutes to repeat the experiment a few times, then let the groups share their findings with the class. You can organise number two of this Activity in two ways. - If you hav e managed to assemble the resources, or if learners have brought them to class, hand out the copies of Galileo's pendulum experiment worksheet to the class, and read through it with them. Once you are sure they understand what to do, let them follow the instructions to set up the experiment. Check that all groups are correctly set up then let them do the first experiment. Let the groups share what they discover, and then let them do the next experiment, share S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 92 2012/09/01 10:00 AM93 UNIT 2 MODULE 6their findings and go on to the next experiment. Discuss the conclusions they reach as a class. - If your class is too big to do this, or y ou cannot assemble enough resources, use the worksheet to instruct one group of learners to set up the experiment, then let another group of learners conduct the first experiment. Let the class discuss the conclusions they come to, based on what they observe. Ask another group to conduct the next experiment and have a class discussion about the results. Do the same with the third experiment and then discuss the conclusions the class reaches, based on what they have observed. Bright idea! Learners may enjoy role playing how they would market their flying machine inv entions to the Bo ard of Direct ors of a big comp any who are inter ested in manufact uring and selling their machines . (Or you could choose the three bes t inv entions which the inv entors would pre sent to the class who are the Bo ard of Direct ors.) Let them form small groups and decide who the inventor will be, and which inv ention from that group will be pre sented. The re st of the group are the Bo ard of Direct ors. The Board of Directors would need to examine the invention and think of ques tions they wan t to ask bef ore they inv est a lot of money int o making and selling the flying machine. The inventor would need to prepare very carefully who would buy the machine, why they would need or wan t it, how they would use it, and what make s it special and diff erent to all other flying machines . If the Board of Directors likes the invention and decides to go ahead with it, they could 's trike a deal' with the inv entor: will they pa y the inven tor for his idea, or will the inv entor not be paid now , but be given a percen tage of the pro fits from the sale of the machine?! Answers to activity Individual/Group Learner's Book page 1201. No correct answ ers, but make sure that learners follow instructions as given during the lesson, and that they have given their inventions appropriate labels. 2. Painter: an artist who makes pictur es using paint; sculptor: a person who creates statues by carving wood or cutting stone; architect: a person who designs buildings; musician: someone who performs or creates music; scientist: a person who studies the physical world; astronomer: a scientist who studies the stars; mathematician: someone who studies mathematics; engineer: someone who plans and constructs machines and builds things like bridges; inventor: someone who is the first person to think of or make something; anatomist: someone who studies the bodies of humans and animals; geologist: a person who studies what rocks and stones are made of; cartographer: a person who draws maps; botanist: animals; palaeontologist: someone who studies fossils; writer: a person who writes books. 3.Reasons for agreeing with the statement that da Vinci was aperfect example of a R enaissance man would include his scientific curiosity and desire to know more about the physical world around him: although he painted religious scenes in his studies he was interested in the here and now rather than the hereafter and religion. As a good example of a Renaissance person, he dedicated his entire life to learning and knew a lot about all sorts of different subjects, such as astronomy, mathematics, engineering, geology, the structure of plants and human and animal bodies, and even fossils. He also made many important scientific discoveries. He was skilled at many different things: he drew maps, he sculpted, he was a musician, he designed buildings and other things like flying machines, and he was one of the greatest artists of the Renaissance.

S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 95 2012/09/01 10:00 AM96 3 MODULE 6Unit 13Unit New ideas and knowledge Learner's Book pages 122-123 1 hour Curriculum content and concepts New ideas during the Renaissance: secularism, humanism, individualism and scepticism The link between the European Renaissance and the golden age of Arab-Islamic science and culture Achievements of middle Eastern and Asian scholars Teaching notes Remind learners that the Renaissance came after a time often called the Dark Ages because there was so much war, poverty and sickness. The word 'renaissance' comes from a French word meaning to be 'reborn', which makes it a good word to describe what happened during the Renaissance period: it is as though humanity was 'reborn' into a time of peace and greater prosperity which made it possible for people to study more and have discussions and debates, enabling the birth of new ideas and knowledge. Read through the text on page 122 with the learners, stopping after each idea to ask questions and allow learners to ask questions until you are sure that they understand the concepts. Ask learners to do the Activity on page 123 in pairs. It is important that you circulate while they are busy. Listen to what they say, assess informally and correct or help where necessary. Read and discuss the first paragraph of text on page 123 of the Learner's Book, as well as the map. Ask learners for how many centuries the golden age of Arab science and culture lasted and compare this with how long the Renaissance lasted to demonstrate that the Arab golden age lasted for a very long time - clearly, they had many ideas and much knowledge to share with Europe! Ask learners to read the rest of the text quietly to themselves. Invite them to put up their hands and ask you the meaning of any words they find difficult. When they have finished reading, tell them to close their books and tell you what they remember. Help them if necessary, with leading questions such as: Who did the Middle Eastern scientists swap ideas with? How did mathematical works published in China centuries ago become a part of the European mathematical heritage? Who can give examples of some of the achievements of Middle Eastern and Asian scholars? S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 96 2012/09/01 10:00 AM97 UNIT 3 MODULE 6Answers to activity Pair Learner's Book page 123 2. Key characteristics of each idea: secularism: the increase of inter est in matters to do with life here, now, in this world rather than (as in the Middle Ages) a concern with religion and faith in things that are not of this physical world; humanism: places human beings and what is best and good about human beings at the centre of the world, rather than God or any other supernatural being (therefore linked to secularism); individualism: allows each individual to believe in and develop what is special about them as an individual; scepticism: sceptics do not take things on faith; they ask questions. Informal assessment Pair activity on page 123 in the Learner's Book: Have the learners grasped the ke of each Renais sance idea ?Bright idea! You could extend the Pair Activity into a very simple class quiz. Ask learner pairs to write down the definitions of the Renaissance ideas they hav e disc ussed. Ask a pair to read out one of their definitions, and let the class guess which idea they hav e des cribed. Ask another pair to do the same and continue until you are confident that learner s hav e grasped the four ideas .! Remedial and extension activities Remedial learners can write definitions of each of the Renaissance ideas in their Learner's Books. Extension learners could write a paragraph explaining how Middle Eastern and Asian scholars have contributed to the knowledge we enjoy today. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 97 2012/09/01 10:00 AM98 6Unit 14Unit Inventions Learner's Book pages 124- 125 2 hours Curriculum content and concepts Inventions during the Renaissance How these inventions changed the world Teaching notes You will need: dictionaries Ask learners to summarise what they have learned about the Renaissance so far (why it happened; two famous Renaissance men - da Vinci and Galileo; the new ideas that emerged in this time). Explain that the class will now turn their attention to Renaissance inventions which brought great changes to our world. Read through the Activity on page 124 with the learners, then let them form small groups to read through the text and discuss their answers to the questions. The Activity will probably work best if you make sure that the learners are in mixed ability groups. Tell them to elect one person in the group to use a dictionary to look up the meaning of any words they don't understand. Take feedback from the groups and discuss some of the ideas that emerge. Make sure that learners always support their opinions with convincing reasons. Read and explain the Activity on page 125. Tell learners to read through the text for this unit again, but this time individually and quietly, and then complete the Activity. If there is time, let individual learners pair up and share their answers with each other. Remember to walk around the class to do informal assessment. Take in the learners' notebooks to check and informally assess their work. Bright idea! If you find that learners have differing views about any particular invention, you could turn that int o a topic for class debat e, e. g. 'The world would hav e been a bet ter place if the match had nev er been inv ented'. Divide the class into 'for ' and 'agains t' group s, let them prep are their argumen ts and then conduct the debat e (guidanc e on how to conduct a class debat e is given in the Grade 4 TG ).! Answers to activities Group Learner's Book page 1242. a) Yes. P ossible reasons (accept all other logical reasons offered by the learners): When people fought with spears and swords, they needed to be close to each other; probably these weapons were quite heavy and it wasn't so easy to run fast carrying them. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 98 2012/09/01 10:00 AM99 UNIT 4 MODULE 6With guns you can shoot people from a distance away; they are light so you can move more quickly and easily, they are faster so you can shoot more people in less time. Gunpowder also made it possible to create bombs to blow up buildings, or kill more people with one explosion. All this would have changed how armies planned their attacks on the enemy and defences against the enemy. b) Yes. P ossible reasons (accept all other logical reasons offered by the learners): The caravels were fast and could sail into the wind because they had tall masts and big square sails. This made it possible to travel further and for a longer time across the sea, to countries very far away. The magnetic compass made it possible to navigate (find your way) accurately, again making it easier and less dangerous to travel far distances over the ocean. c) Sample answers (accept all other plausible ideas that lear ners come up with): without gunpowder, we would still have wars, but our methods of fighting them would be very different; since gunpowder makes blasting (blowing things up) possible, our mining methods and engineering methods would never have advanced - we'd still be chopping out rock; if people hadn't developed ships and instruments enabling sea travel over long distances, perhaps it might have taken much longer for Europeans to discover South Africa (or southern Africa); without the printing press we'd still be writing books by hand, there would be far fewer books and therefore very few people would be able to read; if we still used sundials to tell the time, we wouldn't know the time on days when the sun doesn't shine; without the flush toilet, we would have to find other ways of getting rid of our waste, and that often creates more disease; without the telescope we would never have advanced our knowledge of the stars, without the submarine, we would not be able to travel beneath the sea; without the match we would still need to use sticks and stones and the sun to create fire.

They could then work together to create a poster for display in the classroom. The intention is for learners to enjoy working co-operatively, with remedial learners feeling supported by extension learners, who feel happy to be able to guide and help.

Ask learners to suggest why the Age of Exploration is also known as the Age of Discovery. Let learners identify the major countries travelled to on the world map in the classroom (Africa, Middle East, Asia, India, China). Read through the Group Activity on page 126, and point out that explorers would need to have strong reasons for going on their journeys: the journeys were long, dangerous and often not very comfortable (you might want to spend a few minutes discussing what some of the dangers and discomforts would have been). Let learners work in groups to discuss the question. Take feedback to have a brief class discussion. Discuss the reasons for their opinions - e.g. if they think a desire for spices was a major reason that motivated explorers to go on long and dangerous journeys, then why would they want those spices? It is important for learners to understand that the increase in trade during this time also meant an increase in the number of ordinary people who grew wealthy. Let learners read through the rest of the text on pages 126-127 quietly, and to study the map on page 127. Discuss the text with the class, asking leading questions to ensure they understand the main points (e.g. What were the Europeans especially interested in? Why? Where did spices come from? When did the Europeans start looking for a new sea route to the East? Why?) Ask learners to work in pairs to complete the Activity on page 127. They should write their answers in their notebooks. Learner pairs can join another pair and they can share and compare answers.

Ask the learners if they can remember which was the most powerful kingdom in southern Africa at the time that Dias set out on his journey. T ry to get the learners to imagine what a very big adventure Dias set out on. For example, how would learners feel if they were dropped off in the veld on the outskirts of the city/town/village where they live, and were to set out on foot, to find the next town? How would they ensure that they didn't become completely lost? What preparations would they need to make? Let learners work in pairs to do the Activity on page 128. They should read all the text first and then start working out the correct order. They should draw the timeline in their notebooks and fill in the events in the right places. Go around the class to assess informally and help where needed. Ask learners to close their notebooks and Learner's Books, and tell you the story of Bartolomeu Dias and his voyage around the tip of Africa. How much can they remember? Let a few learners who are good readers read the text on pages 129 to 130 to the class. As they read through da Gama's voyage, stop to show learners the progress of his journey on the world map (you could ask a learner to do this). Make sure that learners understand what caused scurvy, one of the most common causes of death on these early voyages. Ask learners to work in pairs to do the first two questions of the Activity on page 130. Take feedback in a brief class discussion. Learners should do Question 3 of the Activity individually, in their notebooks. Ask the class to look at the two maps at the bottom of page 130, and tell you which map shows whose route. Learners should then work in pairs to do Question 1 of the Activity on page 131. Take brief feedback on this question. Brainstorm a few ideas about the second question with the class as a whole, then let learners work individually to complete the S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 103 2012/09/01 10:00 AM104 UNIT 6 MODULE 6Activity. Take feedback in the form of a brief class discussion about what it would have been like to be a sailor in the 15th century. Let a good reader read the boxed text about da Gama on page 131 in the Learner's Book. When you are sure that everyone has understood the text, let learners work in pairs to discuss the questions in the Activity at the bottom of the page. Learner pairs could join up with another pair to share their ideas and opinions, or you might like to organise a class debate around the question: Was Vasco da Gama a hero who deserved the fame and wealth he got? Bright idea! Explorers Quiz: How much do you remember? Explain to learners that they are going to do a revision quiz. Ask them to work in pair s, and explain how it will work. You will read out a question, followed by four possible answers. The questions are numbered 1 to 10, and the answ ers to each ques tion are indicated with let ters: a, or b, or c, or d.

Sept-No v 1487 Dias stops at Sao Jorge de Mina, the Portuguese fortress on the Gold Coast, to stock up with extra supplies. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 105 2012/09/01 10:00 AM106 UNIT 6 MODULE 6 Sept-No v 1487 Dias sails past the coast of Angola. 1487 Dias r eaches Walvis Bay. 1488 January 1488 D ias unknowingly sails through a storm around the Cape of Good Hope, which he calls the Cape of Storms. Februar y 1488 Dias lands at Mossel Bay, and then at Algoa Bay. 12 March 1488 D ias drops anchor at Kwaaihoek and decides to return home. December 1488 Dias r eturns to Portugal after a voyage of about 16 months. 1500 Dias sails with Captain Pedr o Cabral on the voyage that resulted in the discovery of Brazil. When they reach the Cape of Good Hope, they are hit by a storm. Dias dies at sea. Pair/Individual Learner's Book page 1301. (P air) a) Da Gama's return trip took over 2 years. b) Da Gama took almost a y ear longer than Dias. (Learners can work it out exactly: Dias took 16 months; da Gama took 26 months, so his trip actually took 10 months longer.) 2. (P air) a) Accept all plausible and relevant answers from learners. They should think of some of the following: brav e, adventurous, curious, intelligent, ambitious, determined, persevering (the sort of person who does not give up easily), physical health and strength would also be important. b) Again, accept all plausible and relev ant answers from learners. Some ideas would be: skills; quick thinking skills; decision-making skills; problem-solving skills; as well as skills related to seafaring: excellent sailing skills; excellent navigational skills (read maps and instruments such as the compass; they would also need to be able to 'read' the stars); they would have to be able to repair sails, so sewing skills and woodworking skills; climbing skills (they had to climb the masts); they had to be able to tie excellent knots in ropes; fighting skills; and so on. 3. (I ndividual) See Informal assessment for guidelines to this answer. Pair/Individual Learner's Book page 1311. (P air) a) Probably to help navigate and ensure that the ships did not simply get lost at sea, he would have kept the coastline of Africa within sight. Possibly also so that they could sail to shor e and relative safety if they could see bad storms ahead. Accept any other plausible reasons the learners may think of. b) Da Gama sailed ten y ears after Dias had set out, so he knew what route to take; he would have learned from Dias. Accept other plausible ideas from learners. 2. (I ndividual) See Informal assessment for guidelines to this answer.

It is also important that they allow, or 'tolerate' the opinions of others - no shouting matches are allowed! Informal assessment Pair and Individual Activity, page 130: Can learners draw conclusions, based on the information provided in the text (Ques tion 3)?

P air Activity , page 131: Asse ss learners ' ability to back up their ideas and opinions with convincing reasons. Additional learners could work in Pairs to draw a timeline telling the story of da Gama's journeys. They could use the one on page 128 of the Learner's Book as a guide, and work out their timeline together, but the learners should draw their timeline individually, in their notebooks. Extension learners could work in Pairs to research seafaring conditions in the 15th century, e.g. find out about navigational tools used by sailors at that time; find out about famous (or infamous) pirates; find out about the clothing the seafarers wore; find out about the food they took with them, how and where it was stored and cooked (they could choose, according to their interests). S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 107 2012/09/01 10:00 meets the Khoikhoi Learner's Book pages 132 -133 1 hour Curriculum content and concepts First meeting between Europeans and South Africans Meeting of different cultures and misunderstandings Teaching notes You will need: map of South Africa; dictionaries The class learned about the Khoikhoi herder society and their way of life in Grade 5. Ask volunteers to tell you what they remember. Read and discuss the introductory paragraph and the pictures on pages 132 and 133 of the Learner's Book. Ask a learner to point to Mossel Bay on a map of South Africa. Let the learners get into groups and read through the Activity on pages 132-133. Discuss the Activity briefly, to make sure that everyone understands what they are to do. Tell half the groups that they are the Khoi herders, while the other half are Dias and his sailors. Give the learners time to prepare, then let them role play the meeting. Manage this according to the time and space you have available. You could allow the groups to 'rehearse' their role play, all groups at the same time. This is probably best done outside as it may become rather noisy. Then let a few groups perform their role play to the class. Or you could watch all the groups' role play, one by one (which will be quieter). After each role play, let the groups talk about why they chose to end their 'meeting' in the manner they did. Where they chose to end in conflict, ask learners from each group to give their version of the story (i.e. the Khoi perspective, and the perspective of Dias's men). Briefly discuss with the class how the same event can be told in very different ways, without either way necessarily being completely wrong or completely right. Ask learners to work in pairs to read the text on page 133 in the Learner's Book quietly. Encourage them to use a dictionary to look up words they are not sure of. Ask a few leading questions to make sure learners understand the text, then let them discuss the questions in the Activity on page 133 in pairs. Broaden this into a class discussion when the learners are ready. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 108 2012/09/01 10:00 AM109 UNIT 7 MODULE 6Answers to activities Group Learner's Book page 132 1. Learners' answ ers should be something along these lines, but they will have their own ideas. We saw strange ships and then saw men stopping the ships and climbing into small boats and coming towards the beach. They looked different because they had long hair, pale skins and wore strange clothes covering their bodies. They carried strange objects that we have never seen before. We felt curious about these strange people, and had lots of questions about them - where did they come from? Why did they come here? What did they want? We were also afraid: were they friendly, or not? And what were those strange things they carried - were they weapons? We thought we should go and greet them if they came back the next day, to find out more about them. But we also thought it would be wise to go in a big group, with our weapons in case these people turned out to be unfriendly. 2. See guidelines for Infor mal assessment, if you would like to assess the role plays. Pair Learner's Book page 1331. If the sailors had 'asked ' the Khoi before helping themselves to the water, the conflict may have been avoided. If they had spoken the same language, or spoke each other's language, they would not have misunderstood each other. Perhaps if Dias's men had not shouted, but offered something concrete to the Khoi leader, conflict would not have happened. Accept other plausible answers from learners. 2. They wanted fresh milk and meat. Bright idea! In preparation for and to enhance their experience of the role play, you might like to get learner s to practis e miming. The y could mime, for ex ample, being frightened, being hesit ant or unsure , being bra ve, being puzzled, suddenly underst anding some thing (the moment of 'Aha! Now I unders tand'). The y could also mime becoming friends, as well as thre atening actions, becoming angry and then ev en angrier, being amused or curious about some thing, wanting some thing, not hearing some thing or not unders tanding some thing, and so on.

Explain that now they are moving forward into the next two centuries, the 17 th and 18th, when the Dutch East India Company was very busy and becoming very wealthy. Read the introductory text on page 134 of the Learner's Book with the learners, then ask them to read the text in the box ('Life on board') on pages 134 and 135 quietly to themselves. Briefly discuss the text to make sure that learners have understood what they read. The names of the diseases are not important, what is important is that they were highly infectious (communicable) and therefore difficult to control once one person had become ill. (Scurvy was caused by lack of fresh fruit and vegetables in the diet; sailors' gums swelled up and they often lost teeth. Typhus affected the digestive system or stomach, and dysentery and bubonic plague caused internal bleeding and swollen bumps on the body.) Let learners work in groups to write their lists of good and bad things that might happen to sailors, then read through the rest of the Activity and make sure that they understand what to do: measure and draw a square. The measurement should be divisible by 8, because there are 8 squares across, and 8 squares down. So depending on the size of their paper, their square can be 16 cm across and 16 cm down, or 24 cm across and 24 cm down. If their square is 16 cm \u00d7 16 cm, then they need to mark off where to rule the lines across and down, every 2 cm. If their square is 24 cm \u00d7 24 cm, they will mark off where to draw the lines at 3 cm intervals. Then they can number their squares according to the picture on page 135, draw their snakes and ladders and write in all the good and bad things. Give each group a large sheet of paper or card, and make sure everyone has access to pencils, coloured crayons or pencils and rulers. Circulate while learners are working to help and assess informally. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 111 2012/09/01 10:00 AM112 UNIT 8 MODULE 6Let learner groups share and comment on one another's snakes and ladders boards. If there is time, and if you have dice and counters (or see BrightIdea!) learners can play a game or two. Bright idea! Learners can make their own counters and dice quite easily. You will need: sciss ors, glue or sticky tape, two 50 cent coins per group and differen t colour cardbo ard to make the count ers (or plain card and coloured crayons ); photoc opies of the die template for each group (see Extra resour ces); stiff (not thick) card for each group. T his is what you do: To make the counters, give each group a different colour card and two 50 cent coins (you can also use any other similar sized object). They should trace the shape and cut it out. You will need as many count ers as there are player s for the game in your class. Distribute the count ers so that each player in a group has a differ ent colour. If you run out of colours, learners can cust omise their count er by drawing a picture on it. To make the dice, give each group a die template and a piece of stiff card. Learner s should stick the template onto the card and then cut it out. They should fold the die along the foldlines , put a little glue on the flaps and glue the die together .!

Learners' answers should include at least fiv e of the following points: People moved from an age of faith in God to an age of doubt and questioning. People became less interested in religion and more interested in trade, wealth and material things. Instead of God and life hereafter being the centre of attention, people made human beings and life on this Earth the centre of their attention and their studies. People returned to the study of the ancient Greek and Roman scholars and studied the Bible less. Instead of the community being most important, individual development became the focus of attention and education of the individual became important. Many new inventions changed people's lives forever (or learners may list individual inventions, but they should indicate how the invention changed people's lives). People became adventurous and travelled to distant countries bringing back new goods and new knowledge (or learners may list individual explorers and their achievements, but they should indicate what changes these made to people's lives in Europe).

The ship should be sailing from Portugal to India, Asia and/or China, and according to where it is going should be anywhere between 12 and 26 months long. The purpose of the voyage may include to buy spices, silver, gold, precious stones, and to acquire new knowledge about sea routes. Assess according to the following criteria: Are the learners' answers historically correct (as per suggested answers above)? Are the learners' answers written from a perspective that emphasises the positive aspects of the sea voyage, i.e. have the learners managed to make the voyage sound exciting and attractive, in spite of the dangers? Are the advertisements logically organised? Is all the information presented relevant to the question? 3. Refer to the maps on page 130 of the Learner 's Book for the correct routes followed by each explorer. 4. Learners' answ ers should include the following points: Dias and his crew were badly in need of fresh meat and fresh water. The Khoikhoi and the Portuguese spoke different languages and could not understand each other. The Khoikhoi had never seen Europeans before and both parties were probably curious, but afraid and supicious. Dias's men helped themselves to water from the spring the Khoi people reserved for their animals. This made the Khoi people angry, since it was their custom to ask permission and offer gifts before using the water. The Portuguese tried to offer gifts but the Khoi people misinterpreted their gestures and they started fighting. Dias shot one of the herdsmen dead and the Khoikhoi ran away. Assess according to the following criteria: Is the learner's account of this incident factually correct? Has the learner avoided presenting the incident in a manner which lays all the blame on one party? Is the account well organised and does it present a complete picture of the incident? S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 116 2012/09/01 10:00 AM117 ASSESSMENT 65. Assess the learners' mind-maps on the following criteria: Do the learners ' answers reveal insight into the conditions under which people sailed in the 17th and 18th centuries (such as limited fresh food and water and the resultant diseases, the cramped conditions leading to the rapid spread of disease, the dangers of stormy weather, pirate activity, too much or too little wind, and so on)? Do their mind-maps cover a wide range of points (i.e. they have not merely listed four diseases, lack of fresh food, and lack of fresh water as six separate points)?

Units in this module therefore trace the developments as South Africa was transformed into a democracy after many years of struggle against apartheid. Research project Make sure that you read through Unit 8 in the Learner's Book and this Teacher's Guide before you start your teaching for this term. The project should inform your teaching of all the other units so that learners are well supported in their project work. You should introduce the project early in the term, as the learners should be working on it throughout. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 119 2012/09/01 10:00 AM120 Introduction Learners should do some of their project work in lesson time, and some of the work for homew ork. You there fore need to plan car efully how and when you are going to allocat e classr oom time to the project . Monitor learners' progress regularly, throughout the project (e.g. allocate 10-15 minute s at the end of a les son for learner s to talk about how far they have progr essed, and so that you can help learner s with any problems they encount er).

Take feedback in the form of a brief class discussion. Explore what your learners know about the word 'democracy' in relation to South Africa. You could ask a learner to read out the meaning from the word list on page 179 in the Learner's Book. Explain that democracy and how to be a good member of or participant in a democracy is going to be the theme for this term's work. Let learners examine the picture on page 140 in the Learner's Book, and tell you what is happening (they can ask themselves their 'investigation' questions: who? what? when? why? and so on). Read the introductory text at the top of page 140, and read through the Activity with the class. Explain that they should work alone to do the interviews, and record the answers in their notebooks for report back to class in the next lesson. Don't forget to take brief feedback in the next lesson, and take in the notebooks to check and do informal assessment. Read through the text on pages 140 and 141 with the learners. Remind them that they can look up the meaning of the words in bold, in the word list on page 179. Discuss the last paragraph in relation to the picture of the specimen ballot paper on page 141. Ask them to point to the names of the political parties, the abbreviations for each party, and the logos and photographs of the representatives of each party. Show them where people would make their cross to vote. Ask learners to work in pairs on the Activity at the bottom of page 141. Bright idea! Vote for us! You will need: paper and colour ed pencils or cra yons Tell learners that they are going to form political parties and organise their own election camp aign.

S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 121 2012/09/01 10:00 AM122 UNIT 1 MODULE 7 Briefly discuss political parties, and what makes one political party differ ent from another (usually the issue s they foc us on, and the promise s they make to vo ters). Discuss the kinds of issues the learners could focus on. They should be issues relat ed to the learner s' own live s that they feel str ongly about (e. g. the envir onment, school issue s, animal right s, and so on). In group s, let learner s decide what issue s their par ty will foc us on, and what their promise s will be. They should decide on a name for their party, and design a logo for their part y. Poin t out that it' s a good idea if the name and their logo is relat ed to the issue , or issue s, they will foc us on. In designing their pos ter, they should include a brief , str ong st atement about what their par ty st ands for (i.e . a slogan). Together they should work out an election speech, and select who their 'repre sentative' will be. This is the pers on who will make the speech to the class . The speech should not be more than tw o minute s long. When they are ready, the 'parties' can take turns to present themselves, their logo and their pos ter to the class , and the repr esentative give s the speech. The class can vote for the party who, in their opinion, was the most convincing.

Let them discuss their ideas, then tell them to find the definition on page 179 of the Learner's Book and read it out. Read and discuss the first two paragraphs on page 142 of the Learner's Book with the class. Ask leading questions to establish that they understand it: e.g. Why does the government have to obey the Constitution? Who made up the Constitution? Why did it take so long to draw it up? Read and discuss the next two paragraphs on page 142 and at the top of page143 with the class If there are words they don't understand, encourage them to use the dictionaries in the classroom. If you don't have dictionaries, make sure they at least understand the words 'social values' (things that society, i.e. we, think are valuable or important, e.g. fairness, freedom, equal chances to do things like go to school, etc.), 'principles', which can be explained simply as 'rules', and 'commissions', which you can explain as 'investigations'. Let them re-read the passage quietly to themselves, then ask them to close their books and tell you what they can remember about what the Constitution says. Read through the Individual Activity on page 143 of the Learner's Book, making sure that learners understand what to do. Discuss how they can find the information they need (or see Bright Idea! on the next page). Hand out sheets of paper, make sure everyone has access to coloured pencils or crayons, and let learners complete the Activity. If you want learners to research the information themselves, tell them that they are to complete the Activity in their notebooks, for homework. Remember to let learners share what they have found out about the rights guaranteed to us by our Constitution, at the beginning of the next lesson. Read and discuss the final paragraph and the Flash Facts with the class and talk about what Parliament does. Let learners discuss the Activity at the bottom of page 143 of the Learner's Book in groups. When you think they have had enough time, let them share their ideas with another group.

Group Learner's Book page 143 1. a) Learners may choose to answer 'y es' or 'no', and they may also choose to answer 'yes and no' provided they can give good arguments in support of their answers. b) Learners will come up with a variety of answers. A ccept all well reasoned answers. Some ideas may include: The government may ignore what the majority of people in the country want and need. They may do things and make decisions without explaining why to people. They can get greedy and keep things like money and land for themselves. The government may become very cruel and uncaring about people who are poor, starving or sick. The government may therefore begin to ignore the rights of the people who voted them into power. If the government really becomes too powerful, they eventually destroy democracy and justice. (The key issue for learners to have grasped is that in a democracy everyone is equal and government is voted into (or 'given') power by citizens on the basis of promises they have made to the citizens, and to whom they must report back on progress in achieving those promises.) Informal assessment Individual Activity, page 143 Has the learner illustrat ed a right that is guarant eed by our Constitution ? Has the learner drawn a picture that illustrat es the right clearly? (It does not have to be a beautiful drawing, as all learners ' talents are differ ent, but the drawing should be clear and relev ant.) Is the caption relev ant to the picture and the right? Has the learner written a caption - i.e. a short sent ence or phrase , not more? Gr oup Activity , page 143 Have learners grasped the importanc e of shared power in the concept of democracy ? Can learners give a reas oned argument in support of their ideas and opinions? Are they willing to listen to the ideas and opinions of others , and can they respond with calm, reasoned counter-arguments? Additional resources Information about the Constitution of South Africa: MODULE 7Remedial and extension activities Remedial learners: Your brother is in Grade 4 and has been told to find out about the South African Constitution for homework. To help him, write down five important facts about the Constitution of South Africa. Extension learners: Let learners work in groups to imagine that they are going to form a club (they must decide what kind of club it is, perhaps a music club, or a book club, or a Saturday club, a science club, etc.) They must write a constitution for the club that everyone agrees to.

Record the key ideas learners come up with on the board. Read and discuss the text at the top of page 144 of the Learner's Book. Make sure that learners can tell you what a court is, and the difference between civil and criminal law - see if they can think of examples of an argument which would need to be settled by civil law (e.g. two parties who each blame the other for an accident might be settled by civil law; if married couples want to divorce each other, the settlement between them is decided by civil law). Let learners work in groups to discuss the questions in the Activity on page 144 of the Learner's Book. Walk around while they are busy to assess informally and perhaps make a contribution to one or two of the discussions. Open the discussion to the class as a whole, and let them draw conclusions about whether it really would be a good idea to have no rules in schools and no laws in a country. Explain the Activity at the bottom of page 144 in the Learner's Book, and tell learners to answer it individually in their notebooks. Read and discuss the text on page 145 with the class. Give simple explanations so that learners understand what it means when we say that courts are 'independent' (the only authority they need to obey is the law); 'impartial' (they don't favour any one person or party above another); 'accessible' (everybody can use them) and 'effective' (they do what they are supposed to do: settle arguments). Ask leading questions to check learners' understanding of the different kinds of courts, and the hierarchy in which they are organised. Tell learners to re-read the text quietly with a partner, and complete the Activity at the bottom of page 145. If there is time, let learner pairs join up to ask each other their extra questions. Reminder! Learners should have started on their projects by now. Answers to activities Group Learner's Book page 144There are no right or wrong answers in this Activity, but learners' ideas should show a reasonable grasp of the need for rules to ensure that people S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 128 2012/09/01 10:00 AM129 UNIT 3 MODULE 7respect the rights of others and take seriously the part they can play in making it possible for everyone to live safely and peacefully together. Individual Learner's Book page 144Learners' answers should reveal understanding of the consequences of unlimited freedoms.Some sample answers: Firecrackers would keep people awake at night; could cause very serious harm to people and animals; could cause fires. Littering could cause serious disease; could make places so ugly that no tourists would visit; would cause pollution; would make the area smelly; could attract things like rats and cockroaches that people don't want; could block up places that need to be kept open. Underage drinking could cause very serious health damage to children; could cause accidents and crimes; could stop children from coping at school. Urinating in public would create disease; make the environment smelly; could harm the environment. Speeding would increase the number of accidents and deaths; hospitals would not cope with the demand for their services; car wrecks would be everywhere; it would be more and more unsafe for law-obeying citizens to drive on the roads and more and more unsafe for pedestrians. Noise pollution would keep people awake when they need to sleep; would damage people's and animals' hearing; would make people and animals very stressed and angry and could cause them to get sick. Illegal dumping would damage the environment and create pollution; this would create health problems; people would fight with one another if they dumped in one another's areas; it would also make the area look very ugly and it could become very smelly. Pair Learner's Book page 145 1. a) Small claims court; b) community court or traditional court; c) Constitutional Court. 2. Some examples: High cour t - you've been found guilty and you don't agree that you are guilty, or one of your employees has committed fraud against you, resulting in a loss of R150 000 from your business; magistrate's court - your house has been robbed; someone tried to steal your car; small claims court - someone sold you a brand new TV which broke after two weeks and the shop won't replace it; you got very sick after eating in a restaurant and they say it wasn't their fault; equality court: someone keeps calling you horrible names in public; you compete with someone for the same job and think that the other person gets the job because the employer is a friend of that person; traditional court: you want a divorce and you are married according to customary laws; community court: your neighbour borrowed your kettle and now says it is his kettle; someone stole a T-shirt from your shop.

Ask them if they have the right to talk to that person about it. Do they have the right to hit that person who upset them, even if that is what they feel like doing? Talk about the responsibilities that come with rights - learners have the right to talk to someone who has upset them, but the duty to do so without hurting or harming that person. Learners have the right to be listened to, but also the responsibility or duty to listen to others. Read the text at the top of page 146 with learners and let them do the activity below, individually, in their notebooks. Ask learners to work in pairs to read and discuss the case study about Fatima Meer on page 147 in the Learner's Book. Encourage them to use dictionaries if there are words that prevent them understanding what they have read (point out, though, that you do not always have to know the exact meaning of every word to understand what you read). Before learners go on to do the second question individually, ask a few leading questions to check their understanding of what they have read, and briefly explain what passes were and what the Group Areas Act did. Take in their notebooks to check and do informal assessment. Bright idea! Research project: mid-term checking and consultation You may find that now is a good time to inf ormally ass ess learner s' progre ss with their re search project s. Aft er doing the activity on Fatima Meer, it might also be a good time to work through the activity in St ep 3 of Unit 8 (Le arner's Book page 155). Warn learners to bring their 'schedules' and what they have done so far to class . Tell learners how much time you are going to give them to continue on their project s in class , and explain that during this time, you will be available to help with any ques tions they hav e.

Fatima Meer helped to build democracy in South Africa in many different ways. She was one of the women who started the Federation of South African Women, who led the march against the pass laws in 1956. She fought against the Group Areas Act and supported the rights of people who were sent to prison without a trial. She tried to organise a rally with Steve Biko and started the Native Education T rust to raise funds for building five schools in the townships. She was very involved in all kinds of community work: she helped women in informal settlements by teaching them, she fought for the rights of shack-dwellers and rural migrants and she organised scholarships for African students. She paid a heavy price for her activism. She was banned for two years, she was detained without trial, and someone even tried to kill her. She was a very brave woman who contributed a lot to creating democracy in South Africa. Informal assessment Individual Activity, page 146: 1.

What is the Constitution? Why do we have the Constitution? Who approved it? Can anyone remember what the Constitutional Court does? Refer learners to page 145 of the Learner's Book if they can't give you an answer. Read and discuss the text and picture at the top of page 148 in the Learner's Book with the class. See if any learners can think of an example of a disagreement that would be taken to the Constitutional Court. Make sure that learners understand that the Constitutional Court decides on things related to the Constitution, and that even the government has to obey it. So one example of a disagreement might be if the government wanted to bring back the death penalty (capital punishment). The Constitutional Court abolished the death penalty in 1995, so the government's desire to change the law would have to be settled in the Constitutional Court. Let a few good readers take turns to read a paragraph of the case study about Pius Langa. Make sure that they understand that the Chief Justice is the head of the Constitutional Court. Ask leading questions to check understanding, e.g. How did Pius Langa manage to finish school if his family had no money? And how did he then also manage to qualify as a lawyer? How do you think he contributed to building democracy in South Africa? Remind learners about their projects, and point out that they could refer to the biography on Justice Langa for guidance on how to organise their information when they write their biographies. Read through the Activity with the class and make sure they understand Justice Langa's statement, e.g. who might be the weakest among us? (children, the elderly, the sick, etc.) and who might be the worst among us? (murderers, rapists, and so on). Help them understand the second sentence by relating it to our rights and responsibilities: we have a right to be angry with people who do things such as murder or rape, and we have a right to judge or condemn them as criminal and bad, but we also have the responsibility to preserve life; to respect everyone's right to life. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 134 2012/09/01 10:00 AM135 UNIT 5 MODULE 7Lead a class discussion about whether or not they agree with Pius Langa that we should not ourselves become guilty ofkilling people because we want to punish them for killingsomeone. Before you start, ask the learners what their rights andresponsibilities are in a discussion like this (e.g. the right to voiceyour opinion; the right to be heard; the responsibility to allow theopinions of others, even if you disagree; the responsibility to listento what others have to say without interrupting; and so on) - theobject of this is simply to have agreement on a few 'rules' so thatthe discussion remains civil, even if it becomes heated. Bright idea! You might like to turn the Activity on page 149 of the Learner's Book into a debate: Let the class discuss the topic in groups. Ask one group who agrees with Justice Langa, and one group who disagrees with him, to volunt eer for the debate , and select or ask a volunteer to chair the debate and keep time. (If the groups are large, they must select no more than three of their members to speak on their behalf.) Remind learners about the rules of a debate, or ask them to remind you: one speaker at a time; any speaker who interrup ts or shouts is disqualified; each speaker has three minutes (or howe ver much time you think is appropriate for your learners ). Tell the learners that you will open the debate 'to the floor', i.e. to the class, so they should listen care fully, make note s and prepar e questions about the argument s of the speaker s if they want to challenge the speaker, or want more information from them.! Answers to activity Class Learner's Book page 149See guidelines under Informal assessment. Informal assessment There are no right or wrong answers to this question. What is important to asse ss is: Do the learners ' discus sions rev eal a grasp of the concep t of human rights and responsibilitie s? Can they apply this to a complex question? Are they able to see the same issue from differen t points of view? Do they listen to one another' s views ? Do they think critically and ask questions?

Talk about times when they feel their rights were not respected - what happened, and why? Who did they think had treated them unfairly? How did that make them feel? What would have made it better? Talk also about times when perhaps they have treated others unfairly. What happened and why, and did they do anything to make it better? How do they feel about what they did? Read the introductory text on page 150 of the Learner's Book, and then ask individual learners to read out one right from the Children's Charter on pages 150-151. After each right has been read out, discuss it with the class. Ask them to think of examples where some of these rights have been violated, and talk about what children can do to get help (see Bright Idea!). Let learners work in pairs to do the Activity on page 150. They should discuss in pairs, but write the paragraphs individually, in their notebooks. Ask a few learner pairs to present their answers to the class, allowing a few minutes of class discussion after each presentation. Briefly discuss what learners see in the photographs on page 151 of the Learner's Book, how? and so on. Then let them work in groups to do the Activity at the bottom of the page. Bright idea!

I think this is important because in South Africa there are many different people with different religions and cultures, like Christian, Muslim, Jewish and Hindu. It would not be fair to let some people practise their beliefs but not others, and people believe very strongly in their religions and get upset if you try to take it away from them. (2) All children have the right to be protected from neglect and abandonment. This is very important because children are still young and don't know how to do everything for themselves. So they need someone to take care of them and make sure they are safe, healthy and get food. (3) All children have the right to love and affection from their parents and family. I think this is important because the family's love is what makes children feel safe and happy. If children don't get love and are unhappy, they can run away from home and do crime and get into trouble. 2. b) This is a sample answer, intended to indicate what might be acceptable: (1) Children have the r esponsibility to respect the religion, culture and beliefs of other children, and not to mock them or laugh at them. (2) Children have the responsibility to help any children who are neglected or abandoned, and when they grow up they have the responsibility to not neglect or abandon their children. (3) All children have the responsibility to love and be affectionate to their parents and family. Group Learner's Book page 1512. In the first photo, the right of the child to protection fr om all types of violence is being violated and/or the right to protection from township and political violence and to have safe places to go to. In the second photo, the right of the child to be protected from hard labour is being violated. In the third photo, the right of the child to clothing, housing and a healthy diet is being violated and/or the right to love and affection from parents and family. 3. Some suggestions only, learners will hav e many ideas of their own. The child in the first picture: Could be given a false leg; other childr en could help her when she is crossing a busy road; other children could help her by making friends with her and inviting her to join in games in ways that she can, e.g. she could be the referee; organisations could teach children like her how to cope when there are things they can't do. The children in the second photo: repor t the employer who is using them illegally; visit them after school to help them with what they missed in their lessons; create organisations that work to help parents who send their children to work for different reasons; create a special unit in the police force to visit farms and stop child labour. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 138 2012/09/01 10:00 AM139 UNIT 6 MODULE 7The children in the third photo: Y ou could create houses where homeless children can live; you could work to raise money to feed and clothe children who don't have families, you could take one child into your home if your parents can afford that; perhaps we could have boarding schools for homeless children without families.

Make a poster to illustrate the children's right you think is the most important. Your poster should include a drawing, a short explanation of the right, and some information about where children can go for help if they need it. Extension learners: Learners should work in threes.

(They should remember this from map work in Geography.) Let them think of some examples of symbols, then talk about national symbols as symbols of a country. Ask if they can think of any national symbols of South Africa, or if perhaps they know about the national symbols of other countries. Read the text at the top of page 152 with the class, and discuss the caption to the picture of the flag. Let them copy the picture, individually, into their Learner's Books and give them a few minutes to colour it in. They can finish it for homework if they work slowly. Let learners read the text about the history of the national anthem quietly to themselves. When they have finished, they should close their books and tell you what they remember. If you have made photocopies of the national anthem, hand them out and sing the anthem together. If not, write the anthem on the board, let learners copy it into their notebooks and then sing the anthem together. Discuss which languages are used in the anthem and ask learners what they think about the idea of combining the 'apartheid' anthem with the 'anti-apartheid' anthem, and of using the different languages. Talk about badges with the class. Does your school have a badge? Do learners belong to any clubs, or can they think of clubs that also have badges? Why do people make badges? If your school has a badge, does it have a meaning? Learners should be able to draw the conclusion that most badges have symbolic meaning, and usually indicate things that are important, or valued by the people wearing the badge. Read the text on page 153 of the Learner's Book with the learners, and briefly discuss the picture of the coat of arms. Read through the Activity and make sure learners understand what to do. Discuss how they could find information about South Africa's other national symbols - do they know which government department they could write to?red blue greenblack yellowwhitewhite S&M SS 7 MODULE 7Answers to activities Group Learner's Book page 153 2.

See guidelines for informal assessment.Bright idea! Research project check-in At this point , you may wan t to give the learner s some time again to work on their project s in class - you decide how much time you can make av ailable. Warn learners ahead of time, so that they know to bring their work and everything they need to school. Tell learners how much class time you will allocate for their projects - will you give them a whole les son? Or half a les son? Assess their progress informally, and note learners that you need to chase, or to whom you need to give more guidance . ! Informal assessment Group Activity, page 153: 1. The learner s' answ ers do not hav e to be 100 % corr ect, but they should re veal that learner s can identif y things that South Afric a as a whole might consider import ant and valuable; and should be evidenc e of the learner s' ability to think cre atively and dra w infer ences. 2. a) Does the learner 's co at of arms symbolis e what their family value s, or believ es to be import ant?

Discuss the fi rst paragraph, and help learners to think about their choice of leader. Encourage them to talk about famous South African leaders that they know about, and why they admire them. Point out that they can think about places and streets that are named after leaders, for ideas. Make sure that learners understand that they can choose one of the leaders suggested in the Learner's Book on page 154, or they can choose their own leader, but it must be someone who has helped to build democracy in South Africa. Talk about everything the learners will need to do, in order to complete their project by the end of term. Brainstorm a 'To do' list with them, e.g. choose a leader; decide what information I need; decide how to get that information; start collecting the information and take notes; draw up a plan for my biography; and so on. Record the 'To do' list on one side of the board. Give the learners a date by when their projects must be handed in for assessment. Next to your 'To do' list on the board, write the heading 'Dates' and then write the due date next to their last step on the 'to do' list (which should be 'Hand in project'). Tell learners to use a calendar to work out how many weeks they have to do their project, then help them to work out how much time they will need for each task, and agree on dates for the completion of each. Learners can copy this down in their notebooks, or if you have made copies of the project schedule for them, hand them out and let them fi ll in dates (see Extra resources). Point out the importance of using their 'schedules' to help them monitor their own progress, and to consult you for help if they are falling behind. Work through the Step 2 activity with learners. Talk about how they would explain why they have chosen their particular leader, reminding them about the work they did about the qualities S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 143 2012/09/01 10:00 AM144 UNIT 8 MODULE 7of good leaders in Grade 4 (works for the good of others; has courage; dedicated to their beliefs; prepared to sacrifice for the sake of others or their beliefs; and so on). Discuss the information they want to include in their biography, so that they know what information they need to get. Talk about the different ways they can get information, and help them to decide where to keep their notes so that they can find them easily (perhaps at the back of their notebooks, under headings?). Stress that they must use their own words, and for each piece of information, they should note down the sources of their information. Learners must now start the research in their own time. Get them to check the date by when they should have completed this, and discuss any dates and times when you will be available to help, as well as any dates when you will give them lesson time. Work through the Step 3 activity with the class. Talk about why the way we organise information is important (organising information well makes it possible for the reader to follow and understand and enjoy; we can put interesting or important information at the beginning to get the reader interested; if we sum up information at the end, it's easy for the reader to remember the main point of what they've read, and so on). Let learners compare how the information is organised in the Fatima Meer and Pius Langa biographies (Learner's Book pages 147 and 148-149). Can they see a different way of organising the information in either of these biographies? Let learners start their rough outline. If you think they need more help, you could ask them to help you draw up a rough outline of either the Meer or the Langa biography on the board. Show them how to start with key words for the main idea, and then list sub-ideas underneath, also using key words, not full sentences. They must continue their rough outlines at home - get learners to check the date by when they should have finished this, as well as any dates when you will give them lesson time and will also be checking their progress. Read and discuss the Step 4 activity with learners. Get them to help you summarise the process in a flowchart on the board: Draft -> Revise -> Review -> Correct -> Proofread -> Final. Briefly discuss each of these steps and stress that the revision stage is very important. Ask learners to change each of the bulleted statements in number 2 into a question they can ask themselves, to assess their writing, e.g. Are all my sentences clear and easy to understand? Read the Top Tips and make sure learners understand how to use the 'transition' words (you could ask the language teacher to help learners). Discuss who the learners could ask to read and comment on (i.e. review) their biographies. Tell learners the dates and times when you will be available to help them, and any further class time you S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 144 2012/09/01 10:00 AM145 UNIT 8 MODULE 7will give them. Finally, remind them of the date when you expect them to hand in their final work. Bright idea! You may like to organise the project work as follows: Early in the term introduce the project and help learners to select the topic for their biography (Unit 8 Step 1). Work through Unit 8 Step 2 with them, and make sure they have some sort of schedule that helps them to plan and monitor their own progres s. It might also be a good idea to give learners a set time during the week when you will be available to help them with any serious problems they experience (e. g. you could make yours elf available for an hour after school once or twice a week, or during the lunch break once or twice a week, depending on how much help you think your learners might need). If it is difficult for your learners to access a library (e.g. if they live far away and there is no transport ) try to borrow books from a library yourself , and keep them in the classroom for learners to consult. Libraries are often very helpful and willing to come to a special arrangement with teacher s so that they can loan books for an extended period for a school project. If you can't access a library, but have access to the Internet and a printer, you could print out information for learners to consult (see Additional res ources, below). If you want to use this again in future years , it is a good idea to print out single-sided and past e each page onto both sides of cardbo ard (e. g. the cardbo ard at the back of a notepad). You can keep this in plastic sleeve s, or use plastic adhesive . Keep a set of these 'biography cards ' as a res ource for your learners to use for information. Allow a few weeks for learners to collect their information. During this time, allocate a few minutes per week to check in with them regarding their progre ss and what help they need. Mid-term, ask them to report back on the progress of their information gathering, and work through Step s 3 and 4 of Unit 8 with them. At least two weeks before you expect learners to hand in their projects, make sure that they have drawn up their rough outline for the biography.! Formal assessment Use the rubric in the Extra resources section to assess each learner's project work. Make sure each learner has a copy so they know exactly how they will be assessed. Informal assessment Progress in discussion and activities. Additional resources Project schedule (see Extra resources) http://www.sahistory.org.za/people S&M SS Gr6 Book pages 156-157 2 hours 1. Learners will come up with their own ideas. Accept any reasonable answers that ar e relevant to the issues in the question. Note that 'What do you think of ...' repeated for each of the three questions is not really acceptable, as it demonstrates that learners have not given much thought to their work. Here are some sample questions and answers, using Fatima Meer as the example chosen: Q: Mrs Meer, what do y ou think is the most important human right? A: That is a very difficult question. I think all our human rights are very important, but if I have to choose, I think the right for every person to vote is essential. That is what I fought for all my life. Q: Why is it so important that our countr y is a democracy? A: That is a very good question. I t's important because it means that everyone has a say in how our country is governed, whether you are rich or poor, highly educated or not. Q: Why are r ules and laws so important? A: We need r ules and laws so that all the different people in this country can live together peacefully and comfortably. 2. a) Elections are when y ou vote for the political party you want in government. b) Voting means putting a cross next to the name of the political par ty you choose to form a government (voting means choosing is also an acceptable answer). c) A political party is a group of people who hav e the same ideas about how the country should be governed. d) A ballot paper is a piece of paper on which you indicate with a cross which political par ty you are voting for. e) A coat of arms is a kind of badge with pictures and writing on it that show the kinds of things that y ou think are important. 3. Assess learners ' answers according to the following guidelines: Is the answer relevant to the question, i.e. has the learner dealt with whether or not learners should have as much say as staff and parents in the running of the school? Has the learner presented a clear point of view? Is this point of view supported by good reasons? Is the information presented logically? Is all the information relevant to the points being made in the argument? 4. Use the following guidelines to assess the lear ner's ballot paper: Has the learner answered the question asked, i.e. five political parties are listed, and all five are imaginary? Are the names and logos the learner has given to each party suggestive of an issue they stand for? Are the names and logos clearly differentiated (i.e. they are not all so S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 146 2012/09/01 10:00 AM147 ASSESSMENT MODULE 7similar to one another as to be confusing to the voter)? Has the learner included a column or boxes where voters will place their mark? 5. Apartheid ended officially on 27 April 1994. On that day South Africa became a democracy. All South African adults were finally allowed to vote. They could vote for the political party they wanted in government. Before this, only white people were allowed to vote. Today we celebrate 27 April as Freedom Day. 6. The learner' s paragraph should include the following points, which should be presented in logical order: South African Constitution: protect democracy by making sure the government does not have too much power; protect human rights by making sure that the government does its work properly and by creating courts and investigations if rights are abused. Children's Charter: protect children because they can't always protect themselves, protect them from abuse or mistreatment, protect their right to basic needs which will help them grow up peacefully, safely and healthily. 7. Constitutional Court; Supr eme Court of Appeal; High Court; Magistrate's Court 8. Assess answers on the follo wing guidelines: Do learners' answers indicate that they understand the difference between rights and responsibilities, but also the logical connections between them, i.e. can they see the same issue from the perspective of a right, and from the perspective of a responsibility? Does the text in their speech bubbles or in their caption relate to the drawing? 9. Accept any other answers that ar e of relevance to the historical contribution of each person, and are factually correct, e.g.: Fatima Meer campaigned for human rights and social justice. She fought against apartheid for more than 50 years. Justice Pius Langa helped to establish the Constitutional Court and he was Chief Justice from 2005 to 2009.

In South Africa, indigenous medicine is associated with the herbs, remedies and advice given by sangomas or nyangas. Some healers have a vast knowledge of medicinal plants, and Western companies are continuously discov ering more and more pharmaceutical uses for indigenous plants. Indigenous healing takes a holistic approach to illness and treats the patient's spiritual and physical well-being together. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 149 2012/09/01 10:00 AM150 Introduction In contrast, Western medicine is associated with diseases of the physical body, and is bas ed on the principles of scienc e, technology and knowledge dev eloped mainly in We stern Eur ope and Northern America. Western medicine has in the past often neglected the link between the spiritual and the phy sical, but a more holistic appro ach is now commonly par t of the teaching in mos t We stern medical schools . S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 150 2012/09/01 10:00 AM151 UNIT 1 MODULE 8 Unit 11Unit Indigenous healing Learner's Book pages 160-163 2 hours Curriculum content and concepts Illness has more than physical causes Indigenous healers treat illness holistically Using medicinal plants Teaching notes You will need: your collection of pamphlets about herbal remedies Start this Module with the Activity in 'What do you know already?' on page 159 of the Learner's Book. Have a brief class discussion to compare the different ideas learners have about treating illness and ways of avoiding illness. Let learners look at your collection of pamphlets about natural remedies and therapies, and use this as an introduction to the topic of indigenous healing. Find out if any learners can explain the term 'indigenous healing'. If not, explain that you could call it 'natural healing' because it involves people using the natural things they find around them, to heal people's sicknesses, aches and pains. Read and discuss briefly the introduction on page 160 of the Learner's Book with the class, then tell learners to read the Activity and the speech bubbles quietly to themselves. Make sure they understand the word 'symptom' (a sign or signal that you're getting ill) and 'psychological' (things of the mind, and mental states such as sadness or fear or anger). Ask learners to work in groups to discuss the differences between Western and indigenous medicine. When they are ready, they can share their ideas with another group. While they are busy, walk among them to listen, help and assess informally. Ask a learner to read out the explanations of the two bolded words in the passage on page 161 of the Learner's Book, from the Word list on page 179. Ask a few good readers to take turns reading the text to the class. After each paragraph, ask learners to read out the key or main sentence. Explain the methods used by indigenous healers, if your learners are uncertain about them, e.g. a charm could be a small stone worn around your neck to make sure you don't get a sore throat; an incantation is a chant, something like a short, repetitive prayer; infusions are made when people soak something in water, like we soak tea leaves or teabags in water; a poultice is like a warm lotion or cream made from plants and other natural things. Throughout the discussions in this Unit, make sure that learners understand that indigenous medicine is not limited to Africa; it has been and still is practised to a greater or lesser degree S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 151 2012/09/01 10:00 AM152 UNIT 1 MODULE 8throughout the world - in Europe, China, India, America, and so on. Let learners work in groups to do the Activity on page 161 of the Learner's Book, then take feedback in the form of a class discussion. Ask learners to share their experiences of using plants or other natural substances to treat things like a headache, or a sore throat, or toothache and so on (e.g. using oils made from lavender for a headache, or gargling with salt for a sore throat, or using cloves to soothe toothache, etc.). Read and discuss the text and picture on page 162 of the Learner's Book with the class, helping them with any words that create difficulty for them. Ask learners whether they think natural or herbal remedies are always completely safe. Talk with them about this briefly, and stress that medicinal plants contain chemical properties that are believed to help heal medical conditions. They should therefore never try making any medicines from plants without the supervision of an adult who knows what they are doing. If they go out, find a buchu plant and start chewing the leaves, they may well make themselves rather sick! Ask learners to read the Individual Activity on page 163 quietly to themselves, and make sure that everyone understands what to do. They should take notes from the interview, and write up their answers under the headings given in the Activity, in their notebooks. Don't forget to ask a few learners to present their findings to the class at the beginning of the next lesson. Take the notebooks in to check on learners' work and do informal assessment. Ask the class if anyone can explain what you mean when you speak of 'pharmaceutical uses for indigenous South African plants' (using plants that grow wild in South Africa, to make medicines or remedies that you can buy from a pharmacy, or chemist). Read the text on page 163 of the Learner's Book with learners. Ask questions to ensure they understand the text (e.g. What part of the plant is used to make Kaloba? Who makes it? What is it used for? Why are some medicinal plants nearly extinct? and so on). Check that learners know what the registered trademark means (it means that Kaloba is a product made by a particular company and legally registered, so that no other company can make exactly the same product). Ask learners to work in groups to discuss the question in the Activity on page 163. Let the groups share some of their ideas with the class. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 152 2012/09/01 10:00 AM153 UNIT 1 MODULE 8Bright idea!

This is what they would do: Ask learners to work in groups to list the recipes according to the plants used. Tak e feedb ack, and help the class finalise their list of con tents for the book, bas ed on the plant s used. Let learners form groups according to each plant in the contents list. They should collect all the recipe s for their plant , and decide which ones to include in the book. When they are re ady, learner s should join up with another group working on the same plant , to make their final choice s of which recipe s to include. You may have more groups than there are plants used. Ask some groups to brains torm the con tent of a page about how to use herbal remedie s safely . Others could brains torm the con tent of a page on how to sa ve an endangered species of plant . When they are re ady, they should join up with another group working on the same topic to finalise the con tent of their page s. Let groups report back to the class, and help them to finalise what will be included in their book. Help them to decide on a suitable title for their recipe book. Learners could work in pairs to write up and illustrate their recipes, as well as their page s on how to use them saf ely and how to sa ve endangered plant s. Remind them to identif y the sour ce for each recipe (presumably the name of the pers on from whom the learner obt ained the select ed recipe ). Ask learners who you know are good at drawing, to pair up and work on designing and illustr ating a co ver for the book.

Walk around while they are busy to listen and ask questions about what they say. Read through the text on page 164 with the class. The text may be difficult for some learners as the concepts are quite abstract, so check their understanding through questions, and help with simple explanations where possible (e.g. a 'trance-like' state is something like being in a dream but you are awake; being a 'medium' means that the sangoma is a person through whom the ancestral spirits can speak; the 'context' of an illness would include the person's life circumstances at the time - the things they are worried or upset about for example, or whether they have done something wrong or harmful, etc.) Include the Flash Facts in your reading with the class, and ask them to suggest why sangomas are also known as diviners or counsellors. Read through the Group Activity with the class. Ask two different learners to read each statement. Make sure everyone understands what the two different points of view are, then let the learners discuss the question in groups. Ask learners to read the passage about inyangas on page 165 of the Learner's Book quietly to themselves, including the Flash Facts. When they are ready, ask them to close their books and tell you what they remember. Summarise their answers on the board, then ask the class to help you list the ways in which sangomas are different from inyangas. Bright idea! Western or traditional medicine? Ask learners to form pairs. Half the pairs in the class are medical practitioners - one is a traditional healer and the other is a We stern medical doctor . Explain that thes e pair s will be consult ed by a sick child and mother .

S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 156 2012/09/01 10:00 AM157 UNIT 3 MODULE 8Unit 13Unit The fight against infectious disease Learner's Book pages 166-169 4 hours Curriculum content and concepts Edward Jenner and the smallpox vaccination Germs, disease and Louis Pasteur TB and Robert Koch Penicillin and Alexander Fleming Teaching notes You will need: dictionaries; your collection of pamphlets about TB; a large sheet of blank paper or card for each learner group; rulers; coloured pencils and crayons; scissors; glue; photocopies of the TB poster peer assessment sheet (one per group) (Extra resources) Ask the class to tell you about infectious diseases: What are they? Can they give you examples? How does one get an infectious disease? Why are these diseases called 'infectious'? How are they treated? What do we do to prevent infectious diseases from spreading? Read and discuss the text and picture on page 166 of the Learner's Book with the class. Explain that smallpox was a disease that was highly infectious and made people very ugly; you became covered in a rash that turned into blisters that left scars after they had burst. If you were lucky enough to survive, you were left with terrible marks on your skin. Discuss the questions in the Class Activity on page 166. Make sure that learners give you reasons for their opinions about the importance of vaccinations. Tell learners to read quietly to themselves about how Jenner discovered the first vaccine. When they are ready, ask probing questions to check their understanding, e.g. What did Jenner notice about people who caught cowpox? Why did he take pus from the milkmaid's rash and scratch it into James Phipps's hand? How did Jenner prove that cowpox germs protected you from smallpox? Ask learners what they know about the causes of infectious diseases like flu or measles, then read about what people believed in the past in the Flash Facts on page 167 of the Learner's Book with the class. Ask learners to read the passage about germs, disease and Louis Pasteur on page 167 quietly, with a partner. Encourage them to look up words they don't know in a dictionary. When they are ready, ask them to close their books and tell you what they remember. Ask probing questions to test their understanding, e.g. What was Pasteur's theory about the cause of disease? How was this different to what had been believed before? Why do you think this discovery was so important? What process was named after him? Why is this process important? S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 157 2012/09/01 10:00 AM158 UNIT 3 MODULE 8 Read the Individual Activity on page 167 with learners. Let them work in pairs or small groups to discuss how they will find out about pasteurisation. They should find out for homework, and write their notes about pasteurisation in their notebooks. Remember to take feedback on what they have discovered at the beginning of the next lesson, and to do informal assessment of their work. Ask learners to remind you what Pasteur discovered about the causes of disease. Point out that although he discovered that germs cause disease, it was another scientist who discovered that specific germs caused specific diseases, i.e. some germs cause measles and completely different germs cause whooping cough or mumps. Pasteur made many important discoveries but is probably most famous for his discovery of the process of pasteurisation. Now the class will read about another scientist who also made many important discoveries but who is probably most famous for his discovery of the germs that cause TB. Find out what your learners know or perhaps have experienced of TB. Read and discuss the passage and the picture on page 168 of the Learner's Book with the class, explaining any words you think they may have difficulty with. Read through the Group Activity and tell learners to discuss in their groups how they are going to get the information they need. They should do this for homework (or, if you have a good selection of pamphlets about TB that they can use and/or books from the library available in the classroom, they can do their research in the lesson). Hand out sheets of paper or card to each group and let them make their TB posters. Let the groups present their posters to the class. If you have made copies of the TB poster peer assessment sheet, give each group a copy. You could tell the class that the three best posters will be displayed in areas around the school, and ask them to assess which three are the best. Let learners read the text about Alexander Fleming on page 169 of the Learner's Book quietly, in pairs. They should make up three questions about the text, and when they are ready, join up with another pair to ask and answer questions. Walk around to assess informally and help as needed. Call the class together again and ask them to summarise the main points they have learned. Let learners work in their pairs again to complete the Activity on page 169. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 158 2012/09/01 10:00 AM159 UNIT 3 MODULE 8Bright idea! All about germs Do the following activity to help learners underst and how germs are spread, where we will find them and how to prot ect ourselv es from them. You will need: Vaseline; paper tow el or toilet paper; glitter (or nutmeg); talcum powder ; a spray bottle filled with water (which could include food colouring, but that is not ess ential); old magazines; sciss ors; glue; a blank sheet of paper for each learner group; pens and/or coloured pencils Explain that learners are going to see how germs are spread and make a small collage of where they can be found, and decide on way s to prev ent the spread of germs. Let learners form small groups and give each learner a small piece of paper tow el or one square of toilet paper with a tiny dab of Vaseline on it. Walk around with a bottle of glitter , or give each group a small bottle. Learner s should smear their palms and fingers with a tiny bit of Vaseline. This should be a thin film, just enough for the glitter to stick when they sprinkle a little over their hands, i.e. they should not leav e grease marks on everything they touch! Tell learners that the water in your spray bottle is like a cough or a sneeze. Spray a little water in the air a few times, in differ ent part s of the classroom from differ ent angles. Ask learners to put up their hands if they felt drops of water on them. Ask them how the germs from the spray bottle have spread. Then sprinkle a little talcum powder on your hands and blow it off , awa y from the learners (you don't want learners to breathe the talcum powder in!). Do this a couple of times and ask them to watch how long the powder particle s sta y in the air and how long it take s to set tle (this is best done, if possible , against bright light where learners can see the particle s of powder ). If the talcum powder repres ents germs, what does this tell learners about germs? Explain that germs are as tiny and invisible as your water spray and the talcum powder , and they can spread through air and in water droplet s. Briefly discuss the places where we can find germs while you hand each learner group a sheet of blank paper, a pile of magazines, a pair of sciss ors and some glue. Tell the groups to use the magazines to find three to five picture s of places where germs can be found or can hide. They should cut out the picture s to make a collage on their piece of paper, and for each place where germs are found, think of a way to preven t spreading germs. Half way through this activity, tell all the learners to stop. Explain that the glitter repre sents germs, and ask them where they can see glitter . How did the glitter get there? Let learners summarise the three way s germs spread: through water droplet s, through the air, and through touch. They should bear this in mind when they think about instructions for prev enting the spread of germs. Let the groups present their collages to the class, explaining how the germs got to each place and giving advice about how to stop the spread of germs. 3 MODULE 8Answers to activities Class Learner's Book page 166 1. a) A vaccination is an injection (or it can be a tablet) that protects y ou from getting an infectious disease. (If your learners are interested in how it works, here is a very simple explanation. The substance in the vaccination, called the vaccine, contains a weakened version of the micro-organisms that cause the disease, and stimulate your immune system to produce antibodies that protect you against it.) b) Some examples: polio, measles, tetanus, TB, malaria, flu, typhoid, y ellow fever. Learners may come up with others. c) Most learners will probably think it is impor tant, as it stops infectious diseases from spreading so quickly and making everyone in the class sick. Some of the diseases vaccines protect you against are very dangerous diseases, which can kill large numbers of people very quickly if the disease is not controlled. Individual Learner's Book page 167All foods contain bacteria. Some bacteria are good for us and some are harmful. Pasteurisation works with heat to destroy the harmful bacteria. The amount of heat used is very important: it must be just enough to destroy the harmful bacteria, but not so hot that the flavour or colour of the milk or other liquid is changed. Group Learner's Book page 168 TB is an infectious disease which usually attacks the lungs. The symptoms of TB include: constant coughing, especially if blood is coughed up; chest pain; difficulty breathing; weight loss; appetite loss; sweating at night; etc. TB germs are spread through the air when people who have TB cough, sneeze, shout, laugh or spit. Small droplets of water carrying the germs spread through the air and people in the area breathe them in and may become infected. To prevent the spread of TB, you should open doors and windows to allow in a lot of fresh air; use a handkerchief or a tissue or toilet paper when you sneeze; cough into your hand or wash your hands after coughing and sneezing; don't spit; and if you have TB, take your drugs and stay at home while you are infectious. TB is treated with drugs which destroy the TB germs. You have to take the drugs for six months and it is extremely important to carry on taking them for the whole six months, even if you feel completely better.

Let them tell the class about it briefly, then read and discuss the introductory text on page 170 of the Learner's Book with them. Ask a learner to read out each of the discoveries that made surgery possible. After each, make sure that learners understand what it means, e.g. anaesthesia deadens pain; blood transfusions are when you transfer blood from one person to another person who has lost a lot of blood and needs more, etc. Read through the instructions for the Pair Activity on page 170, making sure that everyone understands what to do. Walk around while they are busy to help with any words they find difficult, and to assess informally. Take feedback on the Pair Activity, making sure that learners can explain the benefits, or progress achieved in medical practice, with each new discovery. If you have brought an X-ray to class, show it to the learners and talk about what it shows. Let learners tell their stories about having X-rays, if they have had any done, and ask them to explain why they had an X-ray. Give learners a few minutes to do the Group Activity on page 171 of the Learner's Book. When they are ready, ask them to report back and summarise their ideas in note form, on the board. Find out if any of the learners have heard of Dr Christiaan Barnard, and if so, what they know about him. Ask a few good readers to read the text on page 172, about the first heart transplant. Explain any words you think learners will find difficult and after each paragraph ask a learner to pick out the most important point(s). Talk briefly about heart disease, its causes and how one can prevent it. Make learners aware of your collection of pamphlets and other materials on the subject, then let learners work in pairs to complete the Activity on page 173. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 162 2012/09/01 10:00 AM163 UNIT 4 MODULE 8 Let learner pairs join up to compare and assess their answers. Walk around to help and assess informally throughout the time they are working. Read the introductory text on page 173 with the learners, then let them read the newspaper article quietly to themselves. When they are ready, ask learners what the difference is between the operation they have just read about, and the operation performed by Dr Christiaan Barnard. Have a class discussion around the questions in the Activity at the bottom of page 173. Encourage all the learners to participate - draw in learners who are quieter than others. Make sure that learners listen to one another with interest and respect, and ask probing questions to help them think through and reason their answers.

Here are some examples of how X-rays transformed surgery: X-rays would help surgeons to see exactly where they should cut the body to get to the problem they were operating for; it was easier to see if a bone was completely broken or only cracked; surgeons could see exactly where and how a bone was broken; they could see where all the internal organs are (such as the heart, lungs, liver, intestines, etc.) and could work out what a healthy organ looked like and what an unhealthy organ looked like; this helped to diagnose diseases more easily and accurately; they could find things lodged inside the body, such as a bullet and therefore operate very accurately; and so on. Pair Learner's Book page 173 1. Learners should hav e many ideas of their own, e.g. 'World's first heart transplant in Cape Town'; 'South African heart surgeon S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb history'; 'Dr Christiaan Barnard performs successful heart transplant', and so on. 2. a) Foods bad for your heart: r ed meat, foods fried in a lot of oil, fast foods, full fat dairy products, sweets, chips, cakes and biscuits, are some examples; learners may come up with others that are equally valid.

What are the differences between them? Are there any similarities? Read and discuss the introduction to the Unit on page 174 of the Learner's Book. See if anyone can give you an example of a Western pharmaceutical company (companies that manufacture the medicines we buy from pharmacies or Clicks, or which the clinic gives us, such as headache tablets and vitamin tablets). Make sure learners understand the meaning of 'integrate' (bring together, join, or combine) and see if they can remember the meaning of 'holistic' from Unit 1 (if not, tell them to look it up in the word list on page 179 of their Learner's Book). Let learners do the Activity on page 174 in groups and report back to the class. Ask learners to read the rest of the text on pages 174 and 175 quietly to themselves. Tell learners to find a partner and make up five questions on what they have read. When they are ready, they should join with another pair to ask and answer their questions. Walk around to check learners' understanding of what they have read. Ask a few learner groups to share their questions and answers with the class. Discuss the Activity on page 175 of the Learner's Book with the class to make sure that everyone knows what they need to do. Ask the class how they will go about doing this Activity. Use questions to remind them that they need to plan their work: what information do they want, about the therapy they have chosen? What questions do they need to ask? How will they get the information they need? Remind them that they will need their notebooks to take notes. If they are going to make a poster, how will they illustrate their poster? Remind them, too, that whether they write an essay or make a poster they will need to make a plan for how they will organise their information. Learners should do the research for homework. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 166 2012/09/01 10:00 AM167 UNIT 5 MODULE 8 When the learners work on their posters or essays, make sure that you have blank paper, scissors, crayons and a collection of pamphlets for those learners who want to make a poster. Encourage those who are writing an essay to do a rough plan before they start writing. Walk among the learners to assist where necessary and to assess informally. If there is time, let learners share their work with the class. Bright idea! Talk by a holistic health practitioner If you can, it would be good to invit e one or tw o holistic health practitioner s to visit your school and tell the class about what they do. This would clearly be a use ful activity to do bef ore the learner s do the Activit y on page 175 of the Le arner's Book. Prepare learners for the visit beforehand. Tell them to work in pairs to think of ques tions they would like to ask the pers on. Take feedback from the learners - you may want to let the class work toge ther to decide on the mos t import ant ques tions they wan t answer ed. Let learners write their questions in their notebooks, and point out that it would be use ful to tak e not es during the talk. Ask one of the learners to thank the speaker(s) on behalf of the class, at the end of the talk. You may also like to work with the languages teacher to arrange for the learners to write a let ter of thanks to the speak ers.!

The following points should be included. A sangoma: identified thr ough a calling bestowed by the ancestors, not a personal choice; training lasts from six months up to 10 years; includes learning how to throw bones and how to communicate with the spirits; at the end of the training goes through a process of ancestral spirit possession to become a diviner. An inyanga: chooses to become a healer; trains with an experienced inyanga for a few years; learns what plants and animals can be used to make medicines; learns how to collect and mix the medicines, how they should be used and what for. 3. Medicinal plants: you can use the bar k, or leaves or flowers of medicinal plants to make medicines that cure patients. Holisitic healing is healing which looks at a patient's spiritual, emotional, social and physical well-being at the same time. The germ theory of disease is that most diseases are caused by germs that attack a person's body from outside. Integrative medicine integrates Western and holistic healing practices. 4. Western medicine Indigenous medicine Believes illness has only physical causes Believ es illnes s has phy sical, spiritual and psy chological caus es Treats symp toms Treats caus es and symp toms Uses scienc e and technology for healing Uses medicinal plant s and other natur al remedie s for healing Use s knowledge dev eloped in the We st Uses traditional knowledge pas sed down by generations 5. Some other causes could be that the ancestors are cross with you because you hav e not shown them respect; or your illness could be caused by bad feelings between you and your neighbours; it could be caused by something wrong that you did to someone else; or it could be caused by someone who wants to harm you. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 169 2012/09/01 10:00 AM170 ASSESSMENT MODULE 86. Answers should include any three of the following: William Morton developed anaesthesia which deadened patient's pain during surgery. James Blundell transferred blood from one person to another who was losing too much blood. Karl Landsteiner discovered that there are three main blood groups which led to safer blood transfusions. Ignaz Semmelweis/Oliver Holmes discovered that if healthcare workers washed their hands, disease in hospitals spread less easily. Joseph Lister discovered antiseptics which killed germs in operating theatres. Wilhelm Roentgen discovered X-rays which made surgery more accurate. Christiaan Barnard proved that you can transplant hearts. 7. Society can start integrating holistic and Western healing methods by showing equal respect for both. The government can make traditional African medicine part of our healthcare system. Holistic medical treatments and natural remedies could be made available at hospitals and clinics. Community health workers could be trained in holistic healing methods as well as Western methods. Medical aids could allow you to claim for holistic medical treatments. Formal assessment It's time now for the end-of-year examination. You can set your own examination, or use the one in the Extra resources section of this Teacher's Guide.

Eat only cooked food, and fruits that have been freshly peeled such as oranges or bananas. Wash your hands before preparing or serving food. Wash your dishes and utensils with soap and water. Wash kitchen surfaces and cutting surfaces well with soap and water. Do not allow play in dirty pools or storm water outlets. Do not go to the toilet in rivers or leave sewage where it can be washed into a river by rain. GOLDEN RULES FOR SAFE FOOD PREPARATIONPrepared by KZN Health Promotion Programme Cook raw food very well Many raw foods, such as fish and vegetables, etc., can easily be contaminated with cholera bacteria. Cooking well will kill the bacteria. Do not eat uncooked foods, unless they can be peeled or shelled. (Contaminate means to make something dirty, unclean or poisonous.)Avoid contact between raw foods and cooked foodsSafely cooked food can become contaminated through even the slightest contact with raw food. Potential risks of illness can also be reintroduced by preparing raw food and then using the same unwashed cutting surface and knife to slice cooked food.Choose food processed for safetyIn an area affected by cholera, foods such as fruits and vegetables may not be safe unless they have been processed through canning, drying, etc.Wash hands oftenWash your hands after using the toilet or latrine. Wash hands thoroughly before you start preparing food. Wash your hands after changing or cleaning the baby. After preparing raw foods, such as fish or vegetables, wash your hands again before you start handling other foods.Keep all kitchen surfaces cleanAny surface used for food preparation must be kept absolutely clean. Cloths used for washing or drying surfaces, dishes and utensils should be changed every day and boiled before use. Separate cloths for cleaning the floor also require daily washing.Use safe waterSafe water is just as important for food preparation as for drinking. Bring water to a rolling boil before using it to prepare meals. Bleach or S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 7 2012/09/01 10:00 AM8 EXTRA RESOURCESJik may be used instead of boiling to make water safe.

An Australian company, Coal of Africa Limited (CoAL) has recently been given the go-ahead to begin construction of a coal mine less than 6 km from the Mapungubwe National Park and next to the World Heritage Site. This will have a negative effect on the natural habitat, ecosystems and cultural heritage in and around Mapungubwe, for present and future generations. Several important organisations, including the Endangered Wildlife T rust, the Peace Parks Foundation, the Association of Southern African Professional Archaeologists, the Mapungubwe Action Group, the Wilderness Foundation South Africa, the World Wide Fund for Nature South Africa and BirdLife South Africa, have started a legal battle to prevent any further development of the mine at Mapungubwe. Our country's natural and cultural heritage is threatened, and we must do all we can to defend what is ours. But we need your help to prevent future damage to our precious environment. The mining at Mapungubwe is just the start, with many more mining projects to follow. Anglo Coal has already bought large pieces of land in the area. We need your help to stand up against these mining companies and save our precious environment.

Aristotle thought that a ball that was 10 times as heavy as another ball would fall 10 times as fast. Neither Aristotle nor any one else had ever tested to see if his idea was correct. In 1589, Galileo proved Aristotle wrong when he dropped a 10 pound ball and a 1 pound ball from the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and a crowd watched them hit the ground at the same time. Galileo's experiment showed that experimentation is necessary to test scientific theories. This is what you do: Move a sturdy chair into the centre of the group. One learner inthe group (maybe the tallest person?) climbs up onto the chair. Another learner should stand close by to hold the chair steady. The person on the chair has the two balls of differing weights. Other learners in the group make sure that they can see clearlywhat happens when the balls are dropped. The learner on the chair drops the two balls from the same height,at the same time. The rest of the group watches very carefully: did one ball hit theground before the other? Did they hit at the same time? Record the results in the data table below, by ticking off whichball hit the ground first. For any experiment, it is important to do repeated tests to makesure that your results are consistent. Repeat the experiment at least five times, and record your results.

Source: http://www.sciencebuddies.org S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 6 Unit 2 Galileo's pendulum experiment Galileo Galilei was the first European to study pendulums, and he discovered that their regularity could be used for keeping time. If you pull back a pendulum and then let it go, the time it takes to swing over and then return back to its starting position is one period. This led to the development of the first clocks. In 1656, the Dutch inventor Huygens was the first man to successfully build an accurate clock. The pendulum experiment is also an experiment about gravity. What you will need for the pendulum experiment is: a piece of string, at least 1 metre long; one piece of metal wire to bend into a hook; some nuts from a tool box - they must all be the same weight and must fit onto the hook; a large piece of cardboard to put behind the pendulum, or a large piece of paper that you can stick on the wall behind the pendulum; a pencil; some tape; and a stopwatch. Setting up the pendulum experiment Tape the pencil firmly to the top of a table, leaving about 4 cm hanging over the edge. Make a loop in your string to fit on the end of the pencil, but do not make it too tight fitting. At the other end of your string tie your hook and slide one of the nuts onto the hook. Put your piece of card flat behind the pendulum. Make sure that everything swings freely without sticking. S&M SS Gr6 TG.indb 12 2012/09/01 10:00 AM13 EXTRA RESOURCESExperiment 1: changing the weight In this experiment we are going to find out what effect changing the mass on the end of the string makes. Take your string back about 40-50 cm. Make a mark on yourpiece of paper to make sure that you let it go from the same place every time. As you let it go, start the stopwatch,and count the number of oscillations in one minute. Repeat the experiment 5 times and calculate an average. Put another weight on the hook. Release the weight from exactly the same place. Calculate the timeperiod as before. Repeat 5 times and average the results. T ry the same procedure after adding another weight. What did you find? Experiment 2: changing the angle Go back to just one weight on the string. You have the results from the first mark in your last experiment soyou can use these results again. Now, take the string back only about 20 cm and make a mark asbefore. Let go and count the number of periods for one minute. Repeat 5 times and then work out an average. T ry exactly the same thing but now let go from 10 cm. What difference does the angle of swing make? Experiment 3: changing the length of the string You already have your results from the first experiment and canuse these again. Take the string of the pendulum and cut off about 20 cm. If youare really organised, you can use another length of string from thesame roll to make a shorter one. Take back to the same angle and let it fly. Take another 20 cm off the string, replace and try again. What effect does changing the length of the string have on apendulum?

They are found near the 0\u00b0 latitude in both north and south hemispheres. These regions have high rainfall and the climate is hot and wet. Average rainfall is 500 to 1 000 mm, the temperatures average 20 \u00b0C to 30 \u00b0C. The overall the temperature range is low. The large amount of sunlight and rain are good growing conditions. Natural vegetation is mostly tall trees growing closely together. Rainforests are areas of high biodiverstiy - the climate and vegetation provide food and water for many different types of animals and plants. Human activities mostly include cutting down trees and clearing land to make way for farming, roads or mining. These activities are causing deforestation - the destruction of rainforest regions. For example: Hot deserts Hot deserts are found in North and South America, North Africa, the Arab Peninsula and some parts of Asia and Australia. These regions are mostly found along or near the T ropics of Cancer and Capricorn (latitudes 23 \u00b0N and 23 \u00b0S), in both north and south hemispheres. Hot deserts have very high temperatures and very low rainfall. Average desert temperatures can be over 30 \u00b0C in July. Temperatures can drop to -30 \u00b0C in January. Average rainfall can be less than 250 mm. Because of the harsh climate and sand there is little vegetation or wildlife in deserts (few species of plants or animals).
