POTS -related diagnosis were 10% higher compared to other diagnosis following vaccination In the same cohort 25 myocarditis cases were diagnosed; 7 before vaccination, 18 after vaccination Reviewers of article said this was too high Of 12,460 with Sars-CoV-2 infection, 605 of 1005 POTS-related diagnosis were made after infection, a 5 times greater than after COVID-19 vaccination .
