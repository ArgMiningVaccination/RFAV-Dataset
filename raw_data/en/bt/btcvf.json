I had some really thorny issues I needed to deal with that were holding me back in many areas of my life. She's a true healer. Her psychic reading was right on as far as what was going on with me. What I appreciate the most is how carefully Emily chooses her words to describe what she's seeing in your energy. Her words are extremely descriptive, non judging and creative with an edge of humor that made me feel comfortable and kept me from taking myself too seriously. The energy healing after the reading made me feel, well....different about myself. Seriously. I left with enough confidence, clarity, strength, and self love to begin to deal with my problems by facing them instead of avoiding them. - 8/8/2021 Emily is a very gifted healer. She is insightful, intuitive, light hearted, humble and a blessing! I have connected with her over Zoom for a clairvoyant session and felt very relieved and light after that... Her healing helped me tremendously to get back to life with a new perspective. I would recommend her to anybody who is ready for a change in their lives. - 10/7/2018 Amazing readings every time:) Emily is beautiful soul, healer and a gifted clairvoyant. - 10/2/2017 Emily is a solid, powerful being- when she's with you, she brings her full attention, clarity, care, and guidance. She's a gifted healer, I highly recommend her. - 9/11/2018 I came to Emily about intestinal issues, hoping to get insight from an energetic perspective. Emily is a gifted clairvoyant, as well as healer. Her reading was relevant and provided another dimension of guidance in my approach towards the health challenges in my life, and how I relate to my body. Such a loving presence too. - 6/4/2012 Emily really gets straight to the point; even if its only 20 minutes. You'll enjoy your session. - 5/7/2013 Emily came highly recommended and I feel very blessed to have had such an open, inuitive and healing session with her. I'm grateful for her abilities to feel and see into the areas of my life I was seeking insight into that I was not able to find meaning to myself. She offered different perspective and made room for new energy to flow into me. Emily is a bright light and I'm thankful for the gifts she blessed my life with. It was truly empowering and uplifting! - 11/21/2012 I am open to experiences and walk into most with a skeptical eye. I barely had to say anything during my 2 sessions with Emily. I didn't have to speak because she kept saying the exact words that had just popped into my head. Really! There was a moment when I started to think, oh I need to edit what I'm thinking. Ha. While some of what she said is mysterious to me, most felt true on a gut level and some of it brought me to tears. I don't know exactly how the healing actually works, but I felt healed in simply being witnessed on a level that most people will never experience. - 6/10/2012 Emily has a gift of sharing truth with compassion. She is a wonderful healer with an incredible heart. I did a reading with her six months ago with the desire of taking up more space in my life. She gave me a reading with plenty of food for thought, followed by a deep healing. As I look back over the past six months, I know that the work we did together helped clear the space for me to become more fully present in my life. What a gift! - 5/12/2012First to Review I recently had a reading with Emily that really sort of took my breath away. I wanted to get more information on why I was blocked on dating. When she looked behind the blocks, she was able to see some deep seated patterns that blocked me in other areas of my life like money, life path, etc. Amazingly helpful information that I could access right away. I like her manner of non- judgement, so I felt totally safe having her look at the skeletons in my closet!
