Recruitment Criteria | Accepts Healthy Volunteers | Healthy volunteers are participants who do not have a disease or condition, or related conditions or symptoms |No| | Study Type | An interventional clinical study is where participants are assigned to receive one or more interventions (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes. An observational clinical study is where participants identified as belonging to study groups are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes. Searching Both is inclusive of interventional and observational studies. |Interventional| |Eligible Ages||18 Years - 80 Years| |Gender||All| Inclusion Criteria:1. Provide written informed consent. 2. Completed Study AK002-003, defined as having received 4 infusions of study drug and followed through Day 113 (\u00b13 days) in Study AK002-003 and willing to begin extended dosing on or about Day 113. 3. Able and willing to comply with all study procedures. 4. Female patients must be either post-menopausal for at least 1 year or surgically sterile (tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy) for at least 3 months, or if of childbearing potential, have a negative pregnancy test and agree to use dual methods of contraception, or abstain from sexual activity until the end of the study, or for 120 days following the last dose of study drug, whichever is longer. 5. Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception until the end of the study or for 120 days following the last dose of study drug, whichever is longer. All fertile men with female partners of childbearing potential should be instructed to contact the Investigator immediately if they suspect their partner might be pregnant at any time during study participation. Exclusion Criteria:1. Poor tolerance to previous administration of AK002 in the opinion of the Investigator. 2. Known hypersensitivity to any constituent of the study drug. 3. Any disease, condition (medical or surgical), or cardiac abnormality, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would place the patient at increased risk. 4. Planned or expected vaccination with live attenuated vaccines during the treatment, or vaccination expected within 5 half-lives (4 months) of AK002 administration. 5. Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant while participating in the study. 6. Any other reason that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Medical Monitor, makes the patient unsuitable for enrollment. Trial Details | Trial ID: | This trial id was obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov, a service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, providing information on publicly and privately supported clinical studies of human participants with locations in all 50 States and in 196 countries. | | Phase 1: Studies that emphasize safety and how the drug is metabolized and excreted in humans. Phase 2: Studies that gather preliminary data on effectiveness (whether the drug works in people who have a certain disease or condition) and additional safety data. Phase 3: Studies that gather more information about safety and effectiveness by studying different populations and different dosages and by using the drug in combination with other drugs. Phase 4: Studies occurring after FDA has approved a drug for marketing, efficacy, or optimal use.
