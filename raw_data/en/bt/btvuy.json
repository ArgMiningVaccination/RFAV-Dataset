If you've ever considered herbal supplements, meditation, acupuncture, yoga, or a change of diet to promote better health, then you're already familiar with integrative medicine. Integrative medicine describes the addition of natural or holistic practices into the health-care paradigm to complement conventional Western medicine and promote wellness. Western medicine can accomplish incredible feats of healing, but as advanced as it is, it still doesn't have cures for everything. Relying solely on Western medicine, people often wait until they have serious health problems before seeking care - but integrative medicine includes many practices that are particularly good for preventing certain conditions and ameliorating the effects of others. The therapies discussed here have been shown to help people reach health goals such as presurgery preparation, postsurgery recovery, and better management and reduction of chronic pain. Studies indicate that they directly benefit wellness and can help alleviate, prevent, or remedy issues such as arthritis, fibromyalgia, Alzheimer's disease, high blood pressure, stress, heart disease, menopause, and the common cold. The Science of Integrative Medicine, produced in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic - one of the finest health institutions on the planet - provides you with 12 informative lectures on the science-based facts and historical context of commonly used integrative treatments. You'll get a foundational explanation of this diverse new field of medicine, which will give you the knowledge you need to explore these techniques and improve your wellness. Taught by Brent Bauer, MD, director of the Mayo Clinic's Complementary and Integrative Medicine Program, this course provides you with an illuminating exploration of scientifically tested integrative approaches.

He is well aware of the evidence, or lack thereof, of the effectiveness of the cures that are proposed in his clinic. He never ventures to claim that there is any science based proof that integrative medicines work but only that, in some cases, some experiments suggest a possible correlation between certain non western cures and a perceived improvement of a patient's health conditions. Most of the integrative treatments proposed are in fact easily correlated with well being. Relaxing, exercise, a healthy diet and meditation are all factors that understandably improve a person's health conditions and that is no mistery. Just as reckless drunk driving can be hazardous to your health (and that of others). So for the most part this lecture states what should be quite obvious. Not so when he proceeds to illustrate the supposed benefits of acupuncture and chiropractic treatments. Here he borders closely on quackery when he omits to state that both treatments have been largely debunked and limits himself to state that \"some studies seem to show that there mught be beneficial effects\". A For a different, more skeptical (and in my opinion, correct) view, I suggest Dr. Steven Novella's \"Medical Myths\" and \"A Skeptic's Guide\" also in the Courses or Paul Offit's \"Do you believe in magic?\" or any book by Dr. Michael Shermer. The above books give details about the studies they refer to so you can check facts out for yourself. Hope this is helpful. 5 people found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [Judi Heitz](/listener/amzn1.account.AFYD5BAFIWWLTLLXICRA2UEJFW3Q?ref=a_pd_The-Sc_c15_rvlsnl_2&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=M78BPACPAHJV2ZFHHY15&pageLoadId=z4Nz8O84odpmuIIc&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 06-20-17 All about meditation NOT integrative medicine If you want to know all the ways meditation can help your health, this course is good.

I think he would have had more energy had he been actually delivering this information live. I am sure they were very interesting in-person, but I had to speed up the recording to make it through. However, that said, it was well-researched and had good information. Worth listening to if you are exploring integrative medicine. Anyone considering using Mayo Clinic services should listen to the last two chapters at a minimum, because they speak of options that are available there. 2 people found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [Glen I.](/listener/amzn1.account.AEB4RLXPOCBML44U6NVMFS373FVA?ref=a_pd_The-Sc_c15_rvlsnl_6&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=M78BPACPAHJV2ZFHHY15&pageLoadId=z4Nz8O84odpmuIIc&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 10-24-16 Loved it This course was informative, instructional, uplifting and enjoyable to listen to.
