They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced. Buy Ingredients NOT products Your body utilizes nutrients far more efficiently when consumed in real whole foods versus foods that you get from processed food in a box or package. More than 60% of the American diet is from processed food. Start your own garden, shop the produce section, or shop the farmer's market and surround your meals around these foods. Aim for an 80/20 lifestyle and surround each meal with 80% whole food and you are on the right track for improved health! Reduce Your Sugar to Improve Your Health The sugar epidemic is huge in this country. It is extremely addictive and wreaks havoc on our health. Sugar is often hidden in \"health foods\" as well so make sure that you read labels and keep track of how much sugar you intake. Rule of thumb: 1 teaspoon of sugar equals 4 grams on a recipe. Men should consume no more than 9 teaspoons of sugar a day (36 grams). Women should consume no more than 6 teaspoons of sugar a day (25 grams). Teens and older children should consume no more than 4 -5 teaspoons of sugar a day (16 -20 grams). Toddlers should consume no more than 3 -4 teaspoons of sugar per day (12 -16 grams). Just to put it in perspective a 16 ounce bottle of regular soda has 59 grams of soda. That is double the daily amount for a woman in one day and almost 3 times as much for a teenager. Replace sugar in recipes by using natural sources such as honey, pure maple syrup, dates, or sweet fruits like bananas, to cut down on added sugar. Visit Live Well Streator online or on Facebook!
