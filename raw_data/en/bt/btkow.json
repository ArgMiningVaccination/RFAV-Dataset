People from high- and medium-risk areas should inform their residential or village committees, working units or hotels immediately or within 12 hours after arriving in Shanghai, according to the city's epidemic prevention and control authorities. Anyone arriving from a high-risk area is required to have two nucleic acid tests and quarantine for 14 days at designated venues for observation. People from medium-risk areas will also need to have two tests but can spend the 14-day observation period at residential communities. Schools have been ordered to step up health QR code checks and impose relevant health management measures on students and staff from high- and medium-risk areas within 14 days. Ruili City on the China-Myanmar border has three high-risk areas and six medium-risk areas after reporting dozens of locally transmitted COVID-19 cases since March 30. A total of 15 new locally transmitted cases and two new asymptomatic cases were reported there on Monday. At a designated hospital specializing in traditional Chinese medicine treatment in Ruili, medics and experts are making an all-out effort to treat the patients. \"The workload was quite heavy initially but it is getting much less stressful after the arrival of medics from other regions,\" said Wang Huaiti, director of the rehabilitation department of the hospital. \"The patients are basically in stable condition,\" said Li Wei, deputy head of an expert panel leading COVID-19 treatment in Yunnan. \"The National Health Commission has also allocated the plasma of recovered COVID-19 patients to help with the treatment.\" \"The doctor comes every day to check our blood pressure and draw blood. I am feeling much better,\" said Nangapain, a 30-year-old patient from Myanmar, who is receiving treatment in Ruili. Ruili is also conducting large-scale nucleic acid testing along with home isolation, vaccination and epidemiological survey to best curb the epidemic. From March 31 to April 1, Ruili completed COVID-19 tests on more than 300,000 people in the city proper. \"Nucleic acid test is a precise measure to curb the epidemic,\" said Yang Mou, Ruili's vice mayor. As of 2pm on Monday, a total of 126,358 doses of COVID-19 vaccines had been administered in the city. "}
