Molecular Biology, structural and dynamic Biophysics, and Bioinformatics remain the core activities of the Biozentrum with the research being centered on three Focal Areas\": Cell Growth & Development Infection Biology Neurobiology Additionally, two method-oriented Core Programs\" have been developed as scientific glue\". These are: Structural Biology and Biophysics Bioinformatics & Genome Scale Biology Our undergraduate/graduate program in Molecular Biology\" has been redesigned to correspond to the Bolo - gna system, leading to a Bachelor diploma after 3 years, followed by a fast-track Master thesis/program for an additional 1-1.5 years. The program is well received by our students and their appraisal is reproduced on the following page. It was very pleasing to see the Biozentrum with its strong post-graduate program ranked #7 in a world-wide competition of best post-doc places outside the US (cf. The Scientist, Vol. 20, No. 3, 2006). It is our continuing goal to build a partnership with the scientific community in industry in Basel and the wider BioValley Basel area. Sponsored by Novartis Pharma International, we have organized, on behalf of the University of Basel a series of lectures of Nobel Laureates, which were widely advertised and usually attracted an audience of 300-500 participants. So far, we had the privilege to receive Prof. Pierre-Gilles de Gennes (Nobel Laureate in Physics, 1991), Thomas R. Cech (Nobel Laureate in Chemistry 1989), G\u00fcnter Blobel (Nobel Laureate in Medicine 1999), and Stanley B. Prusiner (Nobel Laureate in Medicine 1997). A further major event of the year 2005 was the visit of Jeb Bush, Governor of the State of Florida, with a high- ranking scientific delegation to the Biozentrum. Governor Bush gave a keynote lecture on \"Life Sciences in Florida and Basel\". This visit was organized together with the Basel Chamber of Commerce, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, and the \"Wirtschaftsf\u00f6rderung beider Basel\". The Federal Chancellor Pascal Couchepin was the main speaker in a public discussion on the \"Gene-Mora - torium\". Co-organizer of this event was the Basel Chamber of Commerce, HKBB. This public debate attracted more than 200 visitors to the Biozentrum. The Biozentrum is also intensely engaged in the SystemsX initiative: The ETH Zurich, the University of Zurich and the University of Basel will collaborate in the latest highly interactive scientific approach to biological re - search: Systems Biology. At least one new department of this cross-disciplinary faculty will be located in Basel. In addition, the Biozentrum will participate in the SystemsX program by contributing several scientific programs. 2006 will be the decisive year for launching this joint endeavor. Joachim Seelig Chairman Biozentrum April 2006 2 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005The Biozentrum educates scientists at the bachelor, master, doctoral and postdoctoral level. The particular ad - vantage of the education at the Biozentrum is its direct integration into research. All lecturers are active, grant holding scientists. The ratio of lecturers to students is ideal and ensures optimal support for every student. Bachelor in Biology In 2003 the current biology curriculum was adjusted to the Bachelor/Master system according to the Bologna convention. The Bachelor curriculum takes three years to complete and is taught by lecturers of the Biozentrum and the Department of Integrative Biology. During the first two years of basic studies, the students receive the essential basics in mathematics/statistics, physics, and chemistry, as well as introductory courses in biology. In addition, they are trained in ethics and at - tend optional courses in biology and non-biological subjects. After having completed the basic studies, the students must choose either molecular biology, organismic biology or integrative biology to be the main focus of their further studies. The content of the third year, which consists of block courses lasting several weeks each, determines the Major of the Biology Bachelor. The block courses provide theoretical information which the students then turn into practice in the laboratory or in the field. Master in Molecular Biology Students with a Bachelor in Biology, Major Molecular Biology, are admitted to the fast track Master program that takes 1 to 1 1/2 years. The students work on their Master thesis and take additional courses in molecular biology. The Master thesis replaced the current Diploma thesis as of 2004 and is the students' real introduction to re - search. At the Biozentrum, the students can specialize in Biochemistry, Bioinformatics, Biophysics, Cell Biology, Developmental Biology, Genetics, Immunology, Infection Biology, Microbiology, Neurobiology, Pharmacology, and Structural Biology. A complete list of the Master & Diploma theses completed during the report period can be found on pp 5-6. The interaction between students and the lecturers is additionally supported by the so-called career mentoring: at the beginning of their studies, every student is assigned to a certain lecturer, which implies an early contact between researchers and students. This lecturer, the career tutor, is the student's contact person and personal advisor during the entire duration of his/her studies. The PhD program The Biozentrum also offers a Graduate Teaching Program. Besides the work on his/her dissertation, the student must attend lectures that take place in regular cycles within a time frame of 2 to 3 years. The cycles of the new Graduate Teaching Program cover infection biology, neuroscience, cell biology, integrated biological systems, structure and function of macromolecules, biomolecular interactions and structure, genomics and bioinformatics, plant sciences, molecular biology, and molecular medicine. After approval of the dissertation by the Natural Sci - ence Faculty of the University of Basel, the studies are terminated with a detailed oral examination. A complete list of the dissertations completed during the report period can be found on pp 7-9. Seminars at the Biozentrum The Biozentrum has several seminar series, organized by the focal areas and the core programs, planned sev - eral months in advance and generally given by a senior scientist. Many additional seminars are given that can - not be fitted into the formal series either because they are arranged on short notice or because of scheduling conflicts. We call these \"Informelle Seminare\", informal seminars. They are, however, just as widely announced as the formal ones and many speakers are surprised to find themselves giving their informal seminar to a packed auditorium. These seminars play an important role in the life of the Biozentrum. They are perhaps the most im - portant post-graduate educational activity that we offer, and many a graduate student has secured his first post- doctoral position while sharing a post-seminar drink with the speaker.Teaching Activities3 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Studying Biology at the Biozentrum in Basel - an enriching and challenging experience The opportunity to accomplish our Bachelor's degree in either \"Molecular Biology\", \"In - tegrative Biology\" or \"Animal and Plant Sciences\" enables us students of biology at the University of Basel to take a first step towards our area of preference during undergradu - ate education. This basic concept of the curriculum is highly appreciated since different students hold interests as rich and various as the enormous diversity of subtopics in biology. Thus, a certain separation of organismic and molecular biology, which is mirrored in the independence of the Biozentrum as a separate department, appeals to most students. Nonetheless, a vivid exchange between or - ganismic and molecular orientation remains highly important. This is ensured by the opportunity to study \"Inte - grative Biology\" - a mixture of the two mentioned orientations - and by the fact that we all attend the same basic lectures in the initial four semesters of our education. During the first two years, we are trained in basic scientific disciplines adjacent to biology such as math, physics and chemistry, including some practical work. This provides the opportunity to acquire the basic concepts and tools of scientific thinking. In addition, students gather a solid and broad theoretical background knowledge in biology, as lectures cover fields reaching from animal and plant sciences or ecology to neurobiology, structural biology or biochemistry. The third year is organised in practical block courses, a concept that seems highly popular among nearly all students. It has been repeatedly pointed out that the block courses provide an excellent opportunity to engage in a particular subject much more thoroughly than any lecture would allow: The combination of practical and theoretical work seems to play a key role in understanding biology far beyond the profoundness which theo - retical teaching can mediate alone. But apart from helping to understand complex biological mechanisms and pathways, the numerous experiments in the block courses also enable students to develop valuable practical skills. Furthermore, a factor always important to students is the assistant-to-student ratio, which reaches the value of 1:3 during some block courses, allowing almost everyone to have his or her own personal trainer. In ad - dition, the professors do not seem to be too shy either to show up in the teaching labs and give advice on tricky experiments. Although block courses mean very hard work for many students, they are all in all perceived as well-designed and intelligent establishments, connecting theoretical and practical aspects and giving students a valuable first insight into the actual world of science and research. The basic background taught in the four initial semesters and the block courses complement each other in preparing us for the Master's degree. During graduate studies, students have to prove their abilities to work as scientists in one of the various Biozentrum labs. Supervision by advanced students provides guidance through the whole year to ensure good results in the Master thesis. Generally, graduate students seem to draw a positive personal conclusion from their academic education at the Biozentrum. The well-organised curriculum seems to logically guide us step by step to our academic goals: The lectures on various fields of biology during the initial semesters build on overall scientific thinking, the block courses build on the theory of the mentioned biology lectures and the graduate studies on many practical aspects taught in the block courses. This shows how important it is to ensure a high quality of teaching not only on the advanced level of graduate studies, but also on an entirely basic level from the very beginning of every academic education. Therefore, we must strongly emphasise the importance of didactics in teaching and would like to encourage the staff at the Biozentrum to continuously give careful consideration to this aspect so important to students. A didactically well-organised lecture may open doors which books alone sometimes fail to do. All in all, we conclude that studying biology at the Biozentrum in Basel stands for a solid, interesting and chal - lenging academic education of high quality. In this context, the uniqueness of the block courses should be em - phasised once more: In addition to their valuable academic function, they mediate a strong practical background leading to advantages for graduate studies and, as a consequence, possibly in the job market. VSB Students' Council Report Verein Studierender der Biologie 4 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Apart from the mentioned benefits which the Biozentrum at the University of Basel holds in contrast to other Swiss universities, prospective students should not forget either that Basel is an interesting place to live: As a culturally rich international hotspot, just a few minutes away from the French and German border, it is not sur - prising that one meets people from different countries in Basel and international students of various background at the Biozentrum. The exchange with a foreign student is often an experience of both personal and scientific enrichment.

This explosion in information, due to the recent sequencing of genomes from a wide vari - ety of organisms, has created enormous opportuni - ties for researchers studying the cell. The challenge now is to understand how all these components in - teract to constitute a functioning cell and ultimately a living organism. Research at the Biozentrum in the area of 'Cell Growth & Development' is dedicated to deepen the understanding of complex cellular systems. This focal area constitutes a large part of the overall research effort at the Biozentrum and is thus a hub for the smaller focal areas 'Neurobiology', 'Infection Biology', and the core program 'Genome Scale Biology & Bioinformatics'. 'Cell Growth & De - velopment' also forms a synergistic alliance with the core program 'Structural Biology and Biophysics' working to understand the interactions within a cell at a quantitative and atomic level. The research pro - grams of the individual groups in the focal area 'Cell Growth and Development' are described below. Our focal area comprises ten research groups, headed by Profs. Markus Affolter, Thomas A. Bickle, Walter J. Gehring, Michael N. Hall, Hans-Peter Hau - ri, Urs Jenal, Paul Jen\u00f6, Walter Keller, Peter Philip - sen and Martin Spiess. Prof. Thomas Bickle retired in 2005 after 33 years at the Biozentrum. We thank Tom for his many years of devotion to the Biozen - trum. He has been an outstanding colleague who will be missed for his excellent science, teaching, and administration. Prof. Anne Spang was recruited to the Biozentrum in 2005, and we look forward to her joining us in early 2006. She studies intracellu - lar protein and membrane transport in S. cerevisiae and C. elegans . To provide a platform for scientific exchange and discussions, a monthly seminar se - ries of the focal area \"Growth and Development\" was initiated in 2005. Synergies within the Biozentrum Within the Biozentrum there are numerous fruit - ful collaborations between the research groups in the focal area 'Cell Growth and Development' and groups in the other focal areas and core programs. For example, Jenal has joined forces with Schirm - er and Grzesiek to obtain structural information on a novel protein domain involved in bacterial cell fate determination and cell signaling. Affolter and Grzesiek collaborate to better understand morpho - gen signaling at the molecular and structural level, elucidating atomic structures of the relevant molecu - lar complexes. Hall and Jen\u00f6 are collaborating since INTRODUCTION Professors Markus Affolter, Thomas A. Bickle, Walter Gehring, Michael N. Hall, Hans-Peter Hauri, Urs Jenal, Walter Keller, Peter Philippsen, Anne Spang (starting in 2006), Martin Spiess Scientists University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Cell Growth & Development a number of years to characterize molecular inter - actions involved in growth control. Hall also works in close collaboration with the groups of R\u00fcegg and Barde to study the role of TOR signaling in the post - mitotic growth of muscle and neuronal cells. Several groups in other focal areas or core programs also pursue research programs which as such contribute to a better understanding of important aspects in the field of 'Cell Growth and Development'. Synergies outside the Biozentrum All groups have strong collaborations with experts around the world, both in academia and in indus - try. The Affolter and Gehring groups are members of a 'Network of Excellence' called 'Cells into Organs', which includes 24 groups in 12 universities across Europe. A summer school organized by this network will be held at the Biozentrum in autumn 2006. The Keller group is part of a European Network of labo - ratories studying different aspects of RNA biochem - istry. Teaching All members of the focal area are involved in teach - ing at the undergraduate and postgraduate level. At the undergraduate level, a main part consists in the organization of different introductory lecture-courses. At the postgraduate level, all scientific topics covered by the research groups are the subject of advanced lecture series. The graduate teaching program of the Biozentrum includes nine topic-oriented cycles with a total of almost 50 lectures and courses. In ad - dition, seminars with invited speakers are organized on a regular basis. A monthly seminar series of the focal area \"Growth and Development\" has also been started. INTRODUCTION during part the report periodFocal Area Cell Growth & Development13 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Cell Growth & Development The organization of body pattern in developing mul - ticellular organism is controlled to a large extend by cell-cell signaling. Great efforts have been devoted, in the past decades, to identify and characterize the molecular components of a relatively small number of diverse signaling cascades conserved through - out evolution. We have been studying two impor - tant developmental signals (Dpp/BMP and Fgf) with our efforts concentrated first on characterizing the signaling pathways in detail and deciphering their molecular logic, and second on understanding how these recurring pathways control exquisite cellular behavior during development, both in Drosophila and in zebrafish. Cell signaling in organ formation It has been proposed more than a century ago, that the organization of body pattern might be controlled by so-called morphogen gradients. Only recently has it been possible to demonstrate that secreted proteins of the Transforming Growth Factor (TGF ), Wnt and Hedgehog families specify positional informa - tion by this mechanism. Drosophila Dpp is a member of the TGF superfamily and over the past ten years we have characterized the Dpp signaling pathway in detail, in collaboration with the group of Konrad Basler in Z\u00fcrich. Surprisingly, two nuclear proteins, Schnurri (Shn) and Brinker (Brk), play key roles in Dpp signaling and are responsible for much of Dpp's function as a morphogen. Brk is a DNA-binding tran - scription factor that responses to Dpp; Loss of Brk function causes overproliferation and ec - topic expression of Dpp target genes, while gain of Brk function causes a general loss of Dpp signaling. We find that throughout development, Dpp causes the graded transcriptional downregulation of the brk gene, and it turns out that the inverse gradient of brk generated by the Dpp gradient is instructive and es - sential for organ development. Since the conversion of an extracellular Dpp gradi - ent into an inverse transcriptional gradient of brk is a (the) primary important event in the morphogen rea - dout, we concentrated our efforts in understanding the regulatory steps involved at the molecular level. The dissection of the brk regulatory region identified two elements with opposing properties involved in the morphogen readout; a constitutive enhancer and a Dpp morphogen-regulated silencer. Furthermore, we find that the brk silencer serves as a direct tar - get for a protein complex consisting of the Smad ho - mologs Mad/Medea (which transduce the Dpp signal to the nucleus) and the zinc finger protein Shn.

Other morphogens, which pattern the nervous system or the limb fields in higher vertebrates, might use similar mechanisms. Cell rearrangement in organ formation To gain insight into how signaling pathways control complex cellular decisions during organ morphogen - esis, we investigate the formation of the Drosophila tracheal system, an epithelial branched network similar to the lung, the kidney or the vasculature. Tracheal development serves as a paradigm to un - derstand how epithelial sheets can be transformed by cell signaling and cell-cell or cell-matrix interac - tions into complex three-dimensional networks, a process generally referred to as branching morpho - genesis. Our approach has been to identify genes involved in the process by genetic analysis, and the characterization of relevant gene products by in vivo and in vitro analysis. In addition, we have devoted major efforts to characterize branching morpho - genesis at the cellular level, using avant-garde live imaging technology. Over the past decade, these studies have provided a framework for understand - ing complex processes involved in the architectural design of developing organs, including the control of cell migration and cell rearrangement, and the regulation of the latter by extracellular components (Figures 1 and 2). Studies on the development of blood vessels in high - er organisms suggest strong parallels between tra - cheal development in insects and tube formation in the growing vasculature. Interested by this possible developmental similarity, we have initiated studies aimed at a better understanding of blood vessel de - velopment in zebrafish, one of the most promising animal systems in the study of angiogenesis avail - able at the moment. We indeed find that our ap - proach to study how cells rearrange during tracheal development can provide novel insight into how cells behave during angiogenesis in the zebrafish. We will now reinforce our efforts to study angiogenesis. Figure 1. Cellular architecture of epithelial tubes. (A) All tubes of the tracheal system originate from a flat epithe - lial sheet via branching morphogenesis. (B) Large tubes are formed by several cells contributing to the luminal circumference. All adherence junctions (AJs) are formed between neighboring cells. (C) Fine tubes consist of sin - gle cells wrapped around the lumen. The lumen is sealed by autocellular AJs along the axis of the tube. These fine tubes arise from the larger, multicellular tubes via exten - sive AJ remodelling.

Bickle retires. We have attempted to finish up as much as possible of the ongoing projects on complex DNA restriction and modification enzymes and the results are sum - marised below. On the DNA cleavage mechanism of Type I re - striction enzymes Although the DNA-cleavage mechanism of Type I re - striction-modification enzymes has been extensively studied, the mode of how these enzymes introduce DNA double-strand breaks still remains elusive. In this work, DNA ends produced by EcoKI, EcoAI and EcoR124I, members of the Type IA, IB and IC fami - lies, respectively, have been characterized by clon - ing and sequencing of restriction products from re - actions with a plasmid DNA substrate containing a single recognition site for each enzyme. We show that all three enzymes cut this DNA randomly with no preference for a particular base composition sur - rounding the cleavage site, producing both 5'- and 3'-overhangs of varying 2-3 nucleotides, whereas EcoKI and EcoR124I displayed some preference for formation of 5'-overhangs in a length of about 6-7 and 3-5 nucleotides, respectively. A mutant EcoAI wild-type and nucle - ase-deficient restriction subunits generated a high proportion of nicked circular DNA, whereas the wild- type enzyme catalyzed efficient cleavage of both DNA strands. We conclude that Type I restriction enzymes require two restriction subunits to intro - duce DNA double-strand breaks, each providing one catalytic center for phosphodiester bond hydrolysis and that cleavage of each strand of the DNA is inde - pendent of cleavage of the other. Type I restriction-modification systems in the gram-positive Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis : genetic organization and biochemical characterization. We describe the first purification and biochemical characterization of type I restriction-modification (R- M) enzymes from a dairy bacterium and the second from a gram-positive bacterium. Three type I R-M systems were isolated from the two strains of Lacto - bacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis , Lde88II and Lde82I were overexpressed heterologously in E. purified to homogeneity using FPLC chromatog - raphy.

Lde88I and Lde82I are encoded chromosomally in strains NCC88 and NCC82, respectively. The fully active en - zyme, Lde88II, results from combining NCC88 chro pN42. NCC88 genomic DNA was found to be pro - tected against restriction by both the chromosomally encoded enzyme Lde88I and the recombinational enzyme Lde88II, indicating that both enzymes co- exist and methylate the host DNA in vivo. The specific recognition sites of the NCC88 type I R- M systems were determined to be GAC-N5-GTT for Lde88I and GAA-N7-TTYG for Lde88II. The Lde88I site is the first type I enzyme recognition sequence to consist of two specific trimers. The recognition sites of all other naturally occurring type I restriction enzymes have the structure of Lde88II: a specific tri - mer and tetramer separated by a non-specific spacer of fixed length. Reverse transcription and cDNA analysis showed that the NCC88 hsdR, hsdM and hsdS genes are expressed constitutively in vivo, as is the plasmid- encoded hsdS gene. Interestingly, all three genomic genes are expressed on a single, huge transcript \"hsdR-hsdM-hsdS\" of 5.9 kb, leading to the conclu - sion that regulation of the in vivo concentration of endonuclease with respect to the methylase must rely on the natural RNA instability. Attempts at classification of theLde88I and Lde82I type I restriction enzymes give clear in - dications that lateral gene transfer played an es - sential role in the dissemination of type I restric - tion-modification systems. The isolation and biochemical characterization of three type I restriction-modification (R-M) enzymes, Lde88I, Lde88II and of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lac- tis led us to examine the evolutionary origin of type I R-M systems to determine whether they originate from the Enterobacteriaceae , as one might deduce from the literature available up to the mid-1990s. In the process of fitting the lactobacilli type I enzymes within the type I family sub-classification devised for E.coli and other enterobacterial type I R-M en - zymes, we ascertained that far from being recent ac - quisitions, the lactobacilli R-M systems are very well adapted to their hosts at both the DNA level (G+C content 44%, typical for lactobacilli) and the enzyme level (high optimal activity temperatures of 60-70\u00b0C characteristic of enzymes from the thermophilic L. delbrueckii ). Phylogenetic trees were generated using the Phyl - lip software from putative hsdM and hsdR gene se - quences extracted from genome projects data col - lected in the REBASE database. Interestingly, the classical type IA, IB and IC families could be clearly distinguished as well as the more recently defined type ID family. This allowed us to identify six addi - tional type I families that respect the evolutionary distance accepted for the families previously and extensively described. The phylogenetic trees gen - erated in this work also show distinctly that type I R- M systems propagation within the bacterial kingdom has occurred essentially via lateral gene transfer. A type III restriction enzyme in the oral pathogen, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans These enzymes were discovered by BLAST search - es of the A. actinomycetemcomitans whole genome sequence with the subunit sequences of the entero - bacterial EcoP15I type III enzyme. The genes were then amplified by PCR from the A. actinomycetem - comitans genome and cloned in E. coli . Unfortunate - ly, the methylase subunit expressed in E. coli was insoluble and expression of the restriction subunit was lethal. A by-product of this project was the discovery of a lytic enzyme coded by a prophage of A. actinomy - We have over-expressed and puri - fied the enzyme and shown that it is active in vitro against several Gram negative pathogens. This en - zyme may have therapeutic value and it will continue to be investigated in the laboratory of J\u00fcrg Meyer (Dental Institute, Basel University). Thomas A.

Bickle19 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Cell Growth & Development E.B. Lewis has proposed a model of how homeotic (Hox) genes specify the body plan in insects, which can serve a paradigm for all metazoans since Hox genes are found in all bilaterian animals and homeo - box-containing genes can be traced back all the way to coelenterates and sponges. The Lewis model as - sumes that there is an evolutionary developmental ground state represented in Drosophila by the sec - ond thoracic segment (T2) with a pair of legs (middle legs) and a pair of wings. Insects have evolved from crustacean ancestors, which had a pair of legs on each body segment, and dipteran insects arose from more primitive four-winged insects. Hox genes have evolved which remove the legs from the abdominal segments, leaving only three pairs of legs on the thorax, and the Hox gene Ultrabithorax converts the second pair of wings on T3 into small halteres (bal - ancers). By deleting these genes, Lewis was able to reconstruct an 8-legged and a 4-winged fly. The Hox genes form a cluster of closely linked genes which are arranged in the same order along the chromo - some as they are expressed along the anterior-pos - terior axis in both insects and vertebrates. Origi - nally, Lewis concentrated on the genes specifying the thorax and the abdomen, and he proposed that there was one gene specifying one body segment. However, it turned out that there are only three Hox genes specifying the thorax and three Hox genes for the abdomen. Therefore, the Lewis model had to be modified to include segment-specific enhanc - ers and most recently segment-specific microRNAs. T. Kaufman extended the Lewis model to the head region, which raised the question of the ground state which was thought to be formed in the absence of any Hox gene expression. However, our more recent studies favour the idea that the second thoracic seg - ment indeed represents the ground state and that it is specified by the homeotic Antennapedia (Antp) gene. Function of the homeotic Antennapedia gene During the past year we have accomplished a little breakthrough concerning the function of the Anten - napedia (Antp ) gene, on which I have been work - ing for the last 40 years. Carroll, S.B., Weatherbee, S.D. and Langeland, J.A. (Nature 375: that the second thoracic segment (T2) represents the developmental ground state and develops without the input of homeotic genes. They also claim that there is no requirement for Antp func - tion in Drosophila embryos or imaginal discs for the establishment of the wing primordia and morpho - genesis of the wing. Indeed, they found wing disc primordia in Antp-/- embryos. However, they never Hox and Pax Genes in Development and Evolution Walter J. Gehring Phone +41 61 267 20 51 Fax +41 61 267 20 78 walter.gehring@unibas.ch www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/gehring In collaboration with S. Artavanis-Tsakonas (Harvard); J. White (Yale) Administrative Assistant Greta Backhaus 20 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Cell Growth & Development showed that these wing disc precursors are in fact capable of developing into a wing imaginal disc and finally into a wing. Using genetic mosaics we now have shown that Antp-/- cells are not capable of developing into a wing disc, nor an adult wing, if surrounded by wildtype cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Antp+ is capable of inducing eye into wing transformations. Therefore Antp+ specifies the entire T2 segment including the ventral (leg) and the dorsal (wing) imaginal discs, and the notion of the ground state has to be revised. One definition of the developmental ground state requires that loss-of-function mutations lead to transformations towards the ground state, whereas gain-of-function mutants show transformations in the opposite direction, away from the ground state. Using the nullo-promoter to drive Hox gene expres - sion at the early embryonic preblastoderm and blas - toderm stages, when the body plan is laid down, we have shown that ectopic expression (all over the blastoderm) of Deformed , a Hox gene specifying the maxillary and mandibulary segments of the head, is capable of inducing maxillary cirri on the thoracic segments (a transformation away from the T2 ground state). Similarly ectopic expression of Abd B all over the blastoderm leads to the transformation of all tho - racic and abdominal segments into A8/9 abdominal segments, away from the ground state. Whereas, our earlier studies had shown that the re - moval of the posterior Hox genes lead to a derepres - sion of Antp at the transcriptional level, the ectopic expression of Abd B neither affects Antp transcrip - tion nor the accumulation of the ANTP protein sug - gesting the Abd B and Antp interact at the posttrans - lational level by protein-protein interactions. This interpretation is supported by our recent bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments. Our findings of protein-protein interactions between ANTP and BIP 2, a TATA-binding factor associated protein (homologous to TAF 155) have recently been confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation, showing that BIP 2 binds specifically to the YPWM motif of ANTP. This provides a first link between a Hox gene and the transcriptional machinery. By using fluorescence cross-correlation spectros - copy on single molecules, we have determined the binding constant of the ANTP homeodomain to its DNA binding sites in solution. By some degree of au - tomation we can now search the Drosophila genome for in vitro binding sites and compare the results with chromatin co-immunoprecipitation studies (ChIP on chip) carried out by the group of Kevin White at Yale in collaboration. Pax 6 and Pax 2 in eye development and evolu - tion In our earlier studies we have identified Pax 6 as the master control for eye development. By targeted expression of Pax 6 we can induce ectopic eyes on the antennae, legs and wings of the fruit fly. Using Affymetrix gene chips, we now have analyzed gene expression in eye morphogenesis during larval, pupal and adult stages to decipher the eye morpho - genetic programme . During larval stages when an eye morphogenetic field is first induced, the major - ity of the genes which are induced are transcription factors involved in gene regulation. During pupal stages differentiation of the disc cells sets in and a number of differentiation genes, e.g. cuticular genes, are beginning to be expressed. Finally, in the adult eye all the genes involved in phototransduction are expressed. As the eye developmental programme unfolds progressively more \"eye\" genes are induced, 98 in the late larval eye disc, 409 in the pupae, and 528 in the adult eye. It is interesting to note that some 70% of the genes expressed in the Drosophila retina are also expressed in mouse, indicating that the eye developmental programme of insects and mammals have much in common, which is in line with my hypothesis of a monophyletic origin of the metazoan eye. If eye development is controlled by Pax 6 ranging from planarians to human, the genetic circuits, in particular the eye-specific enhancers, should also be conserved. We tested this hypothesis by using a lens specific gene, the 1-crystallin gene of the chicken in collaboration with Hisato Kondoh's group. This gene is one of the best characterized crystal - line genes. Its lens-specific regulation is controlled by a 25 bp long DC 5 fragment localized in the third intron of the gene. DC 5 contains a Pax 6 and a Sox 2 binding site, and its activity depends on the co - operative binding of these two transcription factors. The Pax binding site is also \"recognized\" by Pax 2. To test the idea that Pax 6 and Sox 2, together with the DC 5 enhancer, could form a basic regulatory cir - cuit shared by distantly related organisms, we intro - duced the DC 5 fragment of 25 bp into Drosophila to test its enhancer specificity. The results indicate that DC 5 enhancer is not only active in the Drosophila compound eye, but remarkably in those cells which secrete crystalline into the liquid lens, i.e. the cone cells. However, DC 5 is under the control of Pax 2 (rather than Pax 6) in combination with Sox 2. As Walter J. Gehring21 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Cell Growth & Development Pax 6 and Pax 2 derive from the same common an - cestor, we propose that during evolution Pax 6 func - tion in vertebrate lens development was retained by Pax 2 in Drosophila. It should be noted that also in chickens Pax 2 can bind to DC 5. Publications Gehring, W.J. (2004). Precis of Edwin G. Conklin's Kurata, S., Jaeger, J. & Gehring W.J. (2004).

Gehring22 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Cell Growth & Development Cell growth is highly regulated. Cells respond to nutrients or other appropriate growth stimuli by up regulating macromolecular synthesis, and thereby increasing in size. Conversely, cells respond to nutrient limitation or other types of stress by down regulating macromolecular synthesis and enhancing turnover of excess mass. Thus, the control of cell growth involves balancing positive regulation of ana - bolic processes with negative regulation of catabolic processes. Growth is also controlled relative to cell division. In proliferating cells, growth is linked to the cell cycle such that most cells precisely double their mass before dividing. In other physiological con - texts, such as load-induced muscle hypertrophy or growth factor-induced neuronal growth, cell growth is controlled independently of the cell cycle. Fur - thermore, in addition to the temporal control of cell growth described above, cell growth can be subject to spatial constraints. For example, budding yeast and neurons grow in a polarized manner as a re - sult of new mass being laid down only at one end of the cell. Finally, in multicellular organisms, growth of individual cells is controlled relative to overall body growth such that the organs and tissues constituting the organism are properly proportioned. The TOR signaling network What are the mechanisms that mediate and inte - grate the many parameters of cell growth? In other words, what determines that a cell grows only at the right time and at the right place? Remarkably, the study of these mechanisms has been largely ne - glected, despite their clinical relevance and despite cell growth being, along with cell division and cell death, one of the most fundamental (and obvious!) aspects of cell behavior. Also remarkable is the find - ing that cell growth control, regardless of eukaryotic organism or physiological context, seems always to involve the same protein - the target of rapamycin TOR protein - and its namesake signaling network. TOR is a highly conserved protein kinase and the target of the immunosuppressive and anti-cancer drug rapamycin. The TOR signaling network con - trols cell growth by activating an array of anabolic processes including protein synthesis, transcription, and ribosome biogenesis, and by inhibiting cata - bolic processes such as bulk protein turnover (au - tophagy) and mRNA degradation, all in response to nutrients. Dysfunction of signaling pathways control - ling cell growth results in cells of altered size and, in turn, causes developmental errors and a wide vari - ety of pathological conditions. An understanding of the TOR signaling network may lead to novel drugs for the treatment of, for example, cancer, diabetes, TOR signaling and control of cell growth Michael N.

We are studying the TOR signaling network in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in mam - malian cells. We have found that the two TORs in yeast, TOR1 and TOR2, mediate numerous signal - ing pathways that fall into one of two major signal - ing branches. The two signaling branches integrate the temporal and spatial control of cell growth. The branch that determines when a cell grows (tempo - ral control) utilizes TOR1 or TOR2 and is rapamycin sensitive. The branch that determines where a cell grows (spatial control) contains TOR2, but not TOR1, and is rapamycin insensitive. The rapamycin sensi - tive 'TOR-shared' branch controls several readouts that collectively determine the mass and thus the size of the cell. These readouts include protein syn - thesis and degradation, mRNA synthesis and deg - radation, autophagy. The known effector pathways that make up this branch involve either the type 2A-re - lated phosphatase SIT4 or RAS and Protein Kinase A (PKA). The rapamycin insensitive 'TOR2-unique' branch controls the polarized organization of the ac - tin cytoskeleton. This branch so far contains a single effector pathway consisting of the small GTPase RHO1, Protein Kinase C (PKC1) and a PKC1-regu - lated MAP Kinase pathway. The elucidation of two major TOR signaling branch - es that integrate temporal and spatial control of cell growth was a major step in the understanding of TOR signaling and cell growth control. However, the two signaling branches also raised new and interest - ing questions. For example, what are the molecular determinants of the specificity and diversity of TOR signaling? Why can TOR2 signal in both branches whereas TOR1 is restricted to only one branch? Furthermore, how does TOR sense and discrimi - nate between different nutrients? To answer these questions, we purified TOR1 and TOR2 in the hope of identifying co-purifying accessory proteins that mediate TOR function. Two functionally and struc - turally distinct, membrane-bound TOR complexes were identified. TOR complex 1 (TORC1) contains LST8, the uncharacterized protein KOG1 and the uncharacterized proteins AVO1, AVO2 and AVO3. As suggested by the fact that TORC1 contains either TOR1 or TOR2 whereas TORC2 contains branch and TORC2 mediates the TOR2-unique signaling branch. We also showed that both TORC1 and TORC2 are conserved in mLST8, the of KOG1 and LST8, re - spectively. mTORC2 consists of rictor (also known as mAVO3) and mLST8. Like its yeast counterpart, mTORC2 is rapamycin insensitive and controls the actin cytoskeleton via a Rho-type GTPase. The two distinct TOR complexes constitute a primordial sig - naling network conserved in eukaryotic evolution to control the fundamental process of cell growth. Thus, the identification of TORC1 and TORC2 was a sig - nificant step in the ongoing characterization of TOR signaling. The molecular functions of the individual TOR part - ner proteins are not known, but most of the partners are essential proteins (only AVO2 is not essential) and likely play an important role in determining the specificity and diversity of TOR signaling. In the case of TORC2, we showed that this complex is oligomer - ic, likely a TORC2-TORC2 dimer. AVO1 and AVO3 bind cooperatively to the N-terminal HEAT repeat region in TOR2, and are required for TORC2 integ - rity. AVO2 is a nonessential - ciated with AVO1 and AVO3. LST8 binds separately to the C-terminal kinase domain region in TOR2 and appears to modulate both the integrity and kinase activity of TORC2. TORC2 aut o phosphorylates sites in AVO1 and AVO3, but TORC2 kinase activity is not required for TORC2 integrity. We also demonstrated that mammalian TOR is oligomeric. The architecture of TORC2 has interesting implications with regard to TORC2 assembly and regulation. Our current and future work focuses largely on further characterizing the two TOR complexes and on elucidating the roles of the TOR partner proteins in yeast and mammals. We hope thereby to determine the molecular mech - anisms by which TOR senses and signals nutrient availability in unicellular and multicellular organisms. The regulation of ribosome biogenesis in response to environmental conditions is a key, but poorly un - derstood, aspect of cell growth control. Ribosomal genes are regulated by the nutrient-sensitive TOR pathway. We described a mechanism by which yeast TOR regulates ribosomal protein (RP) genes via the Forkhead-like transcription factor FHL1. FHL1 has a dual role as an activator and a repressor of transcrip - tion that is determined by its direct interactions with the co-activator IFH1 and the co-repressor CRF1. TOR, via PKA, negatively regulates the kinase YAK1 and thereby maintains CRF1 in the cytoplasm. from FHL1 Michael N. Hall24 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005which is constitutively bound to RP gene promoters. Thus, we described a signaling mechanism linking an environmental sensor to ribosome biogenesis. This mechanism involves a novel mode of action for a Forkhead transcription factor. The above describes only part of our recent findings and current research effort. Many other questions are being actively pursued concerning the role of TOR and the regulation of cell growth. For example, we have recently begun studying the role of TOR in the regulation of organismal metabolism. These ongoing studies have interesting implications when considering hormone- and nutrient-related process - es such as appetite regulation and aging. Appetite and lifespan are regulated by hormones produced in response to nutrients. However, the nutrient sensor that signals the production of such hormones is not known and may involve TOR signaling.

Hall26 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Cell Growth & Development Understanding the molecular mechanisms underly - ing the secretory pathway is a major goal of cell bi - ology and biomedical research. In a eukaryotic cell, hundreds of different proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and subsequently sort - ed along the secretory pathway or secreted to the outside of the cell. The current and future challenge is to identify all key molecules that catalyze each of the numerous steps in protein sorting and to inte - grate their function to understand how organelles are formed and maintained with characteristic struc - ture and function and how itinerant proteins are separated from resident proteins. We are studying major questions related to these issues in human and other mammalian cells using live cell imaging, biochemical, biophysical, and molecular approach - es. Knowledge of these fundamental processes may ultimately lead to new strategies for the treatment of inherited and acquired diseases in which protein secretion is impaired. Morphogenesis of the ER The ER is an extended dynamic network of intercon - nected membrane cisternae and tubules in the cyto - plasm. It is currently assumed that microtubules and kinesin motors determine the structure of the ER by active membrane expansion along microtubules. We discovered that the integral membrane protein CLIMP-63 acts as a morphogen by linking the ER to microtubules. Overexpression of wild-type CLIMP- 63 changes (Fig.1). Overexpression of CLIMP-63 mutants impaired in microtubule binding results in a poorly extended ER without changes of the microtubular cytoskeleton. These results indicate that CLIMP-63- mediated stable anchoring of the ER to microtubules is required to maintain the spatial distribution of the ER. Thus, the concept emerges that ER shape is not only determined by motor driven processes but also by stable attachment of ER membranes to the microtubule cytoskeleton. Identity and dynamics of the ERGIC The ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) defined by the mannose-binding membrane lectin ERGIC-53 consists of a few hundred tubulovesicular membrane clusters and is a mandatory intermediate station for proteins moving from the ER to the Golgi. Are ERGIC clusters mobile transport containers or do they constitute a stationary compartment? To ad - dress this important question we established HeLa cell lines expressing GFP-ERGIC-53 and studied its dynamics using live cell imaging.

Unlike the anterograde marker VSV-G-GFP, GFP- ERGIC-53 did not vectorially move to the Golgi upon exit from the ERGIC, as assessed by a novel quan - titative vector field method. Dual colour imaging of GFP-ERGIC-53 and secretory dsRed revealed that the stationary structures are sites of repeated sort - ing of anterograde and retrograde cargo, and are laterally interconnected by highly mobile elements. These results show that ERGIC clusters are sta - tionary membrane entities rather than mobile carri - ers. Tri-directional (i.e. anterograde, retrograde, and lateral) traffic from the ERGIC is dependent on an intact microtubular network. These results challenge the current most popular view that ERGIC clusters are mobile transport containers. Our working mod - el on membrane traffic to and from the ERGIC is shown in Fig.2. Future efforts will focus on the mo - lecular mechanisms controlling protein sorting in the ERGIC. Transport signal-mediated protein export from the ER It has become increasingly clear that many secretory proteins leave the ER not just passively by default but in a selective way involving transport signals. We found that transmembrane proteins possess cy - tosolic ER-export motifs interacting with proteins of the COPII coat that shapes transport vesicles form - ing at ER exit sites. Thus, direct interaction of coat proteins with ER-export signals can actively recruit membrane proteins into transport vesicles. We de - fined three types of hydrophobic motifs, two of which need to be presented in oligomeric form to operate in ER export, whereas the third one, a C-terminal valine, also operates in monomeric proteins. Current efforts aim at the identification of the COPII coat sub - units responsible for ER-export mediated by the dif - ferent signals. Some soluble secretory proteins also leave the ER in an active way by interacting with a transport receptor which in turn binds to COPII, but the signals required for this cargo-receptor interac - tion are largely unknown. We found a novel type of signal that is composed of a high-mannose glycan intimately associated with a surface-exposed pep - tide beta-hairpin loop. The motif accounts for the lec - tin ERGIC-53-assisted ER-export of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin Z. A similar oligosaccharide/pep - tide loop motif is present in cathepsin C. This is the first documentation of an ER-exit signal in soluble cargo in conjunction with its decoding by a transport receptor. Cargo/receptor mechanism of ERGIC-53 ERGIC-53 is a hexameric membrane protein with lectin activity that operates as a cargo receptor me - diating efficient transport of some glycoproteins in - cluding cathepsin Z and the blood coagulation fac - tors V and XIII. Due to these features ERGIC-53 is an excellent model protein to study cargo receptor- Fig.1: Overexpression of the morphogen CLIMP-63 induc - of ER membranes and microtubules to form rope-like structures (yellow). Fig. 2: Model of the organization of the early secretory pathway and sorting of anterograde and retrograde traffic in University Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Cell Growth & Development mediated glycoprotein transport early in the secretory pathway. Optimal binding of newly-synthesized glyco - protein cargo to ERGIC-53 in the ER requires glucose- trimming and high calcium. The precise carbohydrate specificity of ERGIC-53 is currently being analyzed by affinity chromatography and carbohydrate chip technol - ogy in collaboration with K. Kato and P. Seeberger. In vitro studies revealed efficient binding of ERGIC-53 to immobilized mannose at neutral but not slightly acidic pH. A conserved histidine in the centre of the carbohy - drate recognition domain was identified as a molecular pH sensor. Cell acidification inhibited the association of the cargo protein cathepsin Z to ERGIC-53 and neutrali - zation impaired cargo dissociation. The combined data suggest key roles of pH and calcium in the cargo/recep - tor mechanism of ERGIC-53. To test this hypothesis we need to establish the pH and the calcium concentration of the ERGIC, both of which are currently unknown. Capturing protein interactions in the secretory path - way of living cells Numerous transient protein-protein interactions guide newly synthesized proteins through the secretory path - way. Most of these interactions are of low affinity and transient, and therefore difficult to study. We have de - veloped a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-based pro - tein fragment complementation assay (PCA) to detect protein-protein interactions in the secretory pathway of living cells. YFP fragments were fused to ERGIC-53, the ERGIC-53-interacting multi-coagulation factor deficiency protein MCFD2, and to ERGIC-53's cargo glycoprotein cathepsin Z. YFP PCA analysis revealed the oligomeri - zation of ERGIC-53 and its interaction with MCFD2, as well as its lectin-mediated interaction with cathepsin Z. The YFP PCA analysis also discovered a carbohydrate- mediated interaction between ERGIC-53 and cathepsin C. We conclude that YFP PCA can detect weak and tran - sient protein interactions in the secretory pathway and hence is a powerful approach to study luminal process - es involved in protein secretion, including carbohydrate- mediated protein-protein interactions of low affinity. In search of ERGIC's functions Protein sorting is a major function of the ERGIC. An additional function of the ERGIC is to mediate initial concentration of abundant secretory cargo that leaves the ER by a non-selective process. By an organelle proteomic approach we found some ER-chaperones associated with the ERGIC suggesting that the ERGIC may contribute to protein quality control. The proteome approach also identified new proteins that are currently investigated and may shed new light on the functions of the ERGIC.Publications Appenzeller-Herzog, C. & Hauri, H.P. (2006).

We study cell dynamics in Caulobacter crescentus , an aquatic bacterium with a simple life cycle, which includes an asymmetric cell division and an obligate cell dif - ferentiation. During Caulobacter cell proliferation, a motile planktonic cell differentiates into a sessile, surface adherent cell type. This transition includes the continuous remodeling of the cell poles with dif - ferent extra-cellular organelles being assembled and removed at the correct time and place. A single flagellum is assembled at the pole opposite the stalk preceding cell division. After a defined period the fla - gellum is replaced by the successive formation of adhesive organelles at the same cell pole, includ - ing pili, holdfast, and a stalk. Our work concentrates on the regulatory principles and pathways involved in C. crescentus pole development. In the past two years we have discovered that in this organism pole development is regulated by a novel bacterial sig - nal transduction mechanism, which relies on the controlled synthesis and breakdown of the second messenger cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (c- di-GMP). This and other studies have proposed that c-di-GMP is a general modulator of the transition from a motile, single cell state to a sessile, multicel - lular form of growth, which is often associated with biofilm formation and persistence in pathogenic bac - teria. Our work has pioneered some of the emerging concepts of c-di-GMP signaling, including catalytic, structural, and regulatory aspects of the \"make and break\" of the second messenger (Fig. 1). This was made possible by a successful collaboration with the groups of B. Giese (Chemistry Department) and T. Schirmer (Structural Biology, Biozentrum). Ongoing work concentrates on the identification and charac - terization of additional components of the c-di-GMP signaling pathway in C. crescentus , on their tem - poral and spatial control, and on the elucidation of general regulatory principles of c-di-GMP signaling in bacteria. Temporal and spatial control of pole develop - ment by coupled activation and polar sequestra - tion of a diguanylate cyclase (Paul et al . 2004; Levi & Jenal 2006) Pole development is coordinated with the C. cres - centus cell cycle by two-component signaling pro - teins. The response regulator PleD is required for the correct timing of holdfast formation, stalk biogen - esis, and flagellar ejection during cell differentiation.

Biochemical analysis of PleD revealed that the GGDEF domain is a diguanylate cyclase (DGC), which catalyzes the synthesis of c-di-GMP from two molecules of GTP (Fig. 1). This finding for the first time assigned a biochemical activity to this highly abundant family of bacterial signaling domains and proposed a global role for the second messenger c-di-GMP in bacterial signal transduction. In the meantime this has been substantiated by accumu - lating evidence in favor of a general role of c-di-GMP in bacterial persistence. PleD is activated through phosphorylation by DivJ and PleC, two polar sensor histidine kinases involved in C. crescentus cell differ - entiation. PleD activation is coupled to its sequestra - tion to the differentiating cell pole (Fig. 2). Dynamic localization of PleD to the cell pole provides a mech - anism to temporally and spatially control the signal - ing output of PleD during development. Preliminary evidence suggests that phosphorylation-mediated dimerization provides the signal for PleD sequestra - tion. This has led to the proposal that localized activ - ity of this novel-type signaling protein might consti - tute a general regulatory principle in bacterial growth and development. Ongoing studies are geared to - wards identifying c-di-GMP effector protein(s) of the PleD signal transduction pathway and to analyzing the role of PleD as a \"localized pacemaker\". Structure function analysis of the PleD diguanyl - ate cyclase (Chan et al. 2004) In collaboration with the groups of T. Schirmer and B. Giese we have determined the crystal structure of PleD. While the receiver domains show the expect - ed CheY-like fold, the novel C-terminal DGC domain of PleD is similar to the adenylate cyclase and palm domain of DNA polymerases. The structure allowed making specific predictions concerning activation of PleD by phosphorylation and dimerization, the cata - lytic mechanism, and allosteric control of the PleD diguanylate cyclase. Based on these predictions, we have shown that phosphorylation leads to PleD di - Fig. 1: Schematic of the \"make of DGC and PDE activities. Fig. 2: Dynamic localization of the activated PleD response regulator during the C. crescentus life cycle (top: fluorescence time lapse; bottom: Biozentrum, Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Cell Growth & Development merization and that the dimer constitutes the active enzymatic form. This is the first report demonstrating that bacterial DGCs function as dimers. Mutational analysis also confirmed the dimerization interphase predicted by the crystal structure. Similarly, mutation - al analysis was used to map key catalytic residues of the active site (A-site) of the PleD DGC domain. The PleD structure revealed an unexpected second c- di-GMP binding site (I-site) located at the interphase between the DGC and second receiver domain. This and the observation that PleD activity is subject to strong non-competitive product inhibition (Ki~1\u00b5M) indicated a tight allosteric control mechanism (Fig. 1). Mutational analysis in combination with c-di-GMP binding studies and kinetic assays confirmed that the I-site constitutes a bona fide allosteric binding pocket. In the meantime we could demonstrate that negative allosteric control constitutes a general regulatory principle common to most DGC proteins in bacteria. We propose that this additional level of control allows bacteria to tightly control their cellu - lar c-di-GMP levels and to couple the regulation of c-di-GMP synthesis to its controlled degradation by phosphodiesterases. GTP controls a c-di-GMP specific phosphodies - terase (Christen et al. 2005) It has been hypothesized that c-di-GMP specific phosphodiesterase activity resides in the highly abundant but functionally poorly characterized EAL domain (Fig. 1). We could show biochemically that CC3396, a C. crescentus GGDEF-EAL composite protein is a soluble PDE responsible for about 70% of the cytoplasmic PDE activity. The PDE activity, which rapidly converts c-di-GMP into the linear di - nucleotide pGpG (Fig. 1), is confined to the C-termi - nal EAL domain of CC3396, depends on the pres - ence of Mg2+ ions, and is strongly inhibited by Ca2+ ions. Remarkably, the associated GGDEF domain, which contains an altered active site motif (GEDEF), lacks detectable DGC activity. Instead, this domain is able to bind GTP and, in response, activates the PDE activity in the neighboring EAL domain. PDE activation is specific for GTP (KD 4 \u00b5M) and operates by lowering the KM for c-di-GMP of the EAL domain to a physiologically significant level (420 nM). Muta - tional analysis suggested that the substrate-binding site (A-site) of the GGDEF domain is involved in the GTP-dependent regulatory function, arguing that a catalytically inactive GGDEF domain has retained the ability to bind GTP, and in response, can acti - vate the neighboring EAL domain. Based on these results we propose that the c-di-GMP-specific PDE activity is confined to EAL domains, that GGDEF do - mains can either catalyze the formation of c-di-GMP or can serve as regulatory domains, and that c-di- GMP-specific phosphodiesterase activity is coupled to the cellular GTP level in bacteria. To improve our understanding of the catalytic and regulatory mecha - nisms of bacterial PDEs, we are currently collaborat - ing with the group of T. Schirmer to obtain a crystal structure of CC3396. Cell cycle-dependent degradation of the FliF an - chor protein (Gr\u00fcnenfelder et al. 2004; Kanbe et al. 2005) Flagellar ejection is tightly coupled to the cell cycle in C. crescentus and coincides with the specific deg - radation of several structural motor proteins. In col - laboration with the group of S.I. Aizawa C. crescen - tus hook basal body (HBB) structures were purified and characterized. Purified HBBs were less stable against acidic pH or protease treatment than HBBs of Salmonella typhimurium , supporting the view that flagellar ejection from C. crescentus is initiated by destruction of the fragile basal structures. The MS ring protein FliF, which anchors the flagellar struc - ture in the inner membrane, is degraded coincident with flagellar release. We have identified ClpAP as the protease being responsible for cell cycle-de - pendent degradation A tag mediates protease recognition of FliF. The analysis of the nature of the FliF degradation signal has indicated that both number and positioning of hydrophobic amino acids at the FliF C-terminus are critical for its degradation. These results contribute substantially to our understanding of how proteases specifically recognize and select proteins tagged for destruction. What remains to be elucidated are the regulatory mechanisms, which are responsible for the correct timing of proteolysis during the cell cycle.Urs Jenal32 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Cell Growth & Development Publications Chan, C., Paul, R., Samoray, D., Amiot., N.C., Giese, B., Jenal, U. & Schirmer, T.

Differential splicing and RNA editing give rise to alternate protein products that can have drastically different functional proper - ties. The cap at the 5' end and the poly (A) tails at the 3' end of mRNAs have multiple functions, such as increasing the efficiency of translation, mRNA ex - port and the control of mRNA turnover. Moreover, the different processing steps are coupled to each other and to transcription by RNA polymerase II. Elucida - tion of the functional and structural properties of the factors involved in these reactions is the main focus of our research. Mammalian pre-mRNA 3' end processing factors 3' end formation is an essential step in the maturation of almost all primary RNA polymerase II transcripts that encode proteins. The 3' end formation reaction includes endonucleolytic cleavage of the pre-mRNA, followed by polyadenylation of the upstream cleav - age product. The addition of a poly(A) tail occurs cotranscriptionally and is dependent on functional interactions between the 3' end formation machinery and RNA polymerase II. Six trans-acting factors are sufficient to catalyze mammalian 3' end formation in vitro: cleavage factor (CPSF), cleavage stimulation factor (CstF), cleav - age factors I and II (CF I, CF II), poly(A) polymerase (PAP), and nuclear poly(A) binding protein (PABPN1; previously called PABII or PABP2). The functions of the large number of polypeptides constituting these factors include activities that are directly involved in the cleavage and polyadenylation steps and also in the coupling of this reaction to transcription and to other RNA processing reactions such as capping and splicing. We have found previously that the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor CPSF interacts with the U2 snRNP. Furthermore, we showed that depletion of CPSF resulted in deficient 3' end cleav - age as well as in reduced splicing. Both activities could be reconstituted with partially purified CPSF. Mutations in the U2 snRNP binding site resulted in reduction of the splicing and 3' end cleavage activi - ties. To test whether the U2 snRNP itself is involved in 3' end processing, we digested the U2 snRNA of nuclear extract with RNase H and complementary oligonucleotides. Such treated extracts were not ac - tive in splicing and showed a clear reduction of 3' end cleavage activity.Processing and editing of eukaryotic messenger RNA precursors and of transfer RNAs Walter Keller Phone +41 61 267 20 60 Fax +41 61 267 20 79 walter.keller@unibas.ch www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/keller Group Members M\u00fcller In Collaboration with S.

The 59 and 68 kDa pro - teins are similar in sequence and share some char - acteristic features. The 72 kDa polypeptide is a splice variant of CF Im68 and also the 59 kDa protein con - sists of two alternative splice variants. All the large CF Im subunits have a modular domain organization consisting of an N-terminal RNA-recognition motif (RRM) and a C-terminal alternating charge domain. The RRMs of CF Im68 and CF Im59 are not sufficient for RNA binding but are necessary for the associa - tion with the 25 kDa subunit. Efficient RNA binding requires a heterodimeric complex of either CF Im68 or CF Im59 with the 25 kDa protein and is mediated by the C-terminal alternating charged domain of the larger CF Im subunits. Whereas multiple protein in - teractions with other 3' end processing factors are detected with CF Im25, CF Im68 in contrast to CF Im59 interacts with members of the SR family of splicing factors via its C-terminal alternating charge domain. In collaboration with Dr. Silvia Barabino (University of Milano) we have found that this domain is also re - quired for targeting CF Im68 to the nucleus. However, CF Im68 does not concentrate in splicing speckles but in foci that partially co localize with paraspeckles, a sub nuclear component in which other proteins in - volved in transcriptional control and RNA processing have been found.

Although the structures of mammalian and yeast PAPs are known, their mechanism of ATP selection has remained elusive. In a recent bovine PAP struc - ture complexed with an analog of ATP and MnCl2, strictly conserved residues interact selectively with the adenine base, but the nucleotide was found in a \"non-productive\" conformation. In the new structure, obtained in the presence of MgCl2, 3'-dATP adopts a \"productive\" conformation similar to that seen in yeast PAP or DNA polymerase \u00df. Mutational analy - sis and activity assays with ATP analogs suggest a role in catalysis for one of the two adenine-binding sites. The other site might function to prevent futile hydrolysis of ATP. Steady state kinetics experiments under distributive polymerization conditions suggest a sequential random mechanism in vitro, in the pres - ence of ATP and RNA, without preference for a par - ticular order of binding of the two substrates. tRNA CCA transferases, tRNA maturing enzymes found in all organisms, and eubacterial poly(A) polymerases are so similar that until recently their biochemical functions could not be distinguished by their amino acid sequence. BLAST searches and analysis with the program \"Sequence Space\" for the prediction of functional residues revealed sequence motifs which define these two protein families. One of the poly(A) polymerase defining motifs specifies a structure that we propose to function in binding the 3' terminus of the RNA substrate. Similar motifs are found in other homopolyribonucleotidyl transferases. Phylogenetic classification of nucleotidyl transfer that eubac - terial poly(A) polymerases have evolved relatively recently and are found only in a small group of bac - teria, and surprisingly also in plants, where they may function in organelles. In collaboration with Dr. Mario M\u00f6rl (Max-Planck-Institute for Evolutionary Anthro - pology, Leipzig) domains responsible for substrate specificity of bacterial poly(A) polymerases and tRNA CCA transferase were identified. We showed by do - main substitution experiments that exchange of N- and C-terminal regions leads to chimeric enzymes with unexpected activities, indicating that tRNA nu - cleotidyltransferase carries an \"anchor domain\" in the C-terminal section that restricts polymerization to three nucleotides. A 27 amino acid region was identified that determines whether poly(A) or CCA is synthesized by the enzyme chimeras. Sequence alignments suggest that the catalytic cores of both enzymes carry identical components involved in nu - cleotide recognition and incorporation. This seems to be the prerequisite for the observed reprogram - ming of the catalytic center of PAP to incorporate a sequence of defined length and composition instead of long stretches of A residues. 3' end processing of mRNA precursors in yeast Biochemical fractionation of yeast extract has shown that 3' end processing of yeast pre-mRNAs requires four multisubunit factors which can be separated by column chromatography. Cleavage only occurs in the presence of cleavage factors I and II (CF I and CF II), whereas specific polyadenylation of \"pre- cleaved\" RNA substrates requires CF I, polyadenyl - ation factor I (PF I) and poly(A) polymerase. We had previously shown that CF II contains a subset of polypeptides that are also present in PF I and that a large complex of PF I together with poly(A) poly - merase could be isolated by affinity chromatography. This complex combines CF II/PF I and poly(A) poly - merase activities and is now called cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF). Thus, the complete 3' end processing reaction can be reconstituted in vitro by combining CF I and CPF. Active CF IA and CPF can also be prepared by tagging one of their subunits and subsequent affinity purification.Walter Keller35 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Cell Growth & Development We have previously identified six new polypeptides in affinity-purified CPF fractions. The new proteins were a Pti1p, protein phos - and the non-essential Ref2p and Cpf11p proteins. We have characterized some of these new proteins genetically and bio- chemically in recent years. We will also continue with the analysis of the other subunits of the CPF complex. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae WD-40 repeat pro - tein Swd2p is found as a component of two function - ally distinct multiprotein complexes: the cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) that is involved in pre- mRNA and snoRNA 3' end formation and the SET1 complex that methylates histone 3 lysine 4. Based on bioinformatic analysis we predict a sev - en-bladed \u00df-propeller structure for Swd2p proteins. Northern, transcriptional run-on and in vitro 3' end cleavage analyses suggest that temperature sensi - tive swd2 strains were defective in 3' end formation of specific mRNAs and snoRNAs. Protein-protein interaction studies support a role for Swd2p in the assembly of 3' end formation complexes. Further - more, histone 3 lysine 4 di- and tri-methylation were adversely affected and telomeres were shortened in swd2 mutants. Underaccumulation of the Set1p methyltransferase accounts for the observed loss of SET1C activity and suggests a requirement for Swd2p for the stability or assembly of this complex. We also provide evidence that the roles of Swd2p as component of CPF and SET1C are functionally independent. Taken together, our results establish a dual requirement for Swd2p in 3' end formation and histone tail modification. A new poly(A) polymerase complex from S. cere - visiae The most notable development in our recent re - search has been the characterization of a new type of protein complex with poly(A) polymerase activity from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that targets RNAs destined for degradation and also functions as an activator of the nuclear exosome. Eukaryotic cells contain several unconventional poly(A) polymerases in addition to the canonical enzymes responsible for the synthesis of poly(A) tails of nuclear messenger RNA precursors. The yeast protein Trf4p has been implicated in a quality control pathway that leads to the polyadenylation and subsequent exosome-medi - ated degradation of al., Dev. 18: 1227-1240, 2004). We have found that Trf4p is the catalytic sub - unit of a new polyadenylation complex that contains Air1p or Air2p as potential RNA-binding subunits, as well as the putative RNA helicase Mtr4p. Comparison of native tRNAiMet with its in vitro transcribed unmodi - fied counterpart as substrates revealed that the un - modified RNA was preferentially polyadenylated by affinity-purified Trf4 complex from yeast, as well as by complexes reconstituted from recombinant com - ponents. These results and additional experiments with other tRNA substrates suggested that the Trf4 complex can discriminate between native tRNAs and molecules that are incorrectly folded. Moreover, the polyadenylation activity of the Trf4 complex stimulat - ed the degradation of unmodified tRNAiMet by nuclear exosome fractions in vitro. Degradation was most ef - ficient when coupled to the polyadenylation activity of the Trf4 complex, indicating that the poly(A) tails serve as signals for the recruitment of the exosome. This polyadenylation-mediated RNA surveillance re - sembles the role of polyadenylation in bacterial RNA turnover. RNA-specific adenosine deaminases and - vert adenosine are divided into two families: Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) act on double-stranded and edit pre-mRNAs, whereas ADATs convert adenosine to inosine in tRNAs. Previously, we have character - ized mammalian ADAR1 and ADAR2, as well as ADAT1/Tad1p from yeast, which forms inosine at position 37 (3' of the anticodon) in eukaryotic tRNA- Ala. We have also identified a yeast adenosine de - aminase that generates inosine at the wobble posi - tion of tRNAs (position 34). This enzyme consists of two subunits, ADAT2/Tad2p and ADAT3/Tad3p, which form a heterodimer. Compari - son of the conserved active site domains of adenos - ine and cytidine deaminases revealed that ADAT2 may represent the evolutionary precursor of ADAT1 and ADARs. We are still in the process to identify, in the ADATs and in their RNA substrates, the features that are important for enzymatic activity, the capac - ity to bind specifically to different tRNAs and for the formation of the Tad2p/Tad3p heterodimer.Walter Keller36 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Cell Growth & Development Publications Betat, H., Rammelt, C., Martin, G. & M\u00f6rl, M.

PLoS Biol 3, e189.Walter Keller37 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Cell Growth & Development We investigate differences and similarities in cellular networks of two eukaryotic microorganisms, the uni - cellular fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii . Despite their differences in life style and growth habitat, both or - ganisms have 95 % of genes in common because they evolved from the same ancestor. Two key cellu - lar functions, polar growth and timing of nuclear divi - sions, are controlled in both organisms by very similar sets of genes. The majority of these genes are pres - ent at syntenic positions confirming their evolution from common ancestral genes. During evolution, the individual role of many of these genes and the net - work interaction as a whole was modified to produce specific differences in growth and nuclear division observed today. Growth of A. gossypii is restricted to the tips thus forming long hyphae. The surface ex - pansion rate is 20 to 40 times higher than in S. cere - visiae which displays alternating phases of polar and isotropic growth. We hypothesize that components controlling the actin cytoskeleton have evolved dif - ferently in both organisms. divisions in mul - tinucleated hyphae of A. gossypii are expected to occur synchronously based on the known controls of nuclear divisions in S. cerevisiae . However, nuclei in A. gossypii divide asynchronously despite the com - mon cytoplasm. We hypothesize that novel modes of regulation of conserved cell cycle proteins direct this nuclear autonomous division cycle. Also cel - lular components other than nuclei are challenged by the different growth patterns of our two model organisms. Therefore, we additionally focus on the de novo synthesis and inheritance of peroxisomes; small single membrane-bound organelles involved in fatty acid metabolism. We have already identified components for slow cytoskeletal-based transport of peroxisomes in yeast and we are currently investi - gating how the same components could account for the rapid dynamics observed in A. gossypii . Genomics as information basis With the help of Syngenta, we sequenced the ge - nome of the filamentous A. gossypii . The an - notated 4718 ORFs show extensive gene order con - servation (synteny) with the S. cerevisiae genome. The complete synteny map allowed to reconstruct the ancient S. cerevisiae genome at the time of its duplication. The data are a rich source for novel approaches to analyze the components of fungal growth and nuclear division including evolution of promoters. The data also allowed important reanno - tations of the S. cerevisiae genome.Networks controlling polar growth, nuclear division and peroxisome biogenesis in fungi Peter Philippsen Tel. +41 61 267 14 80 Fax +41 61 267 14 81 peter.philippsen@unibas.ch H. Tabak (University of Dietrich (Duke University); M. University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Cell Growth & Development Nuclear division in multinucleated cells Multinucleated cells are encountered in a variety of organisms and are integral to processes as diverse as the early development of the fruit fly, bone remodel - ing, and cancer metastasis. One molecular explana - tion for synchronous mitoses in multinucleated cells is that cyclin proteins and cyclin dependent kinases are shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This enables the core cell cycle machinery to diffuse freely and influence multiple nuclei in the same cy - toplasm. Thus, in multinucleated eukaryotic cells studied to date, continual communication between nuclei and the cytoplasm coordinates synchronous nuclear division. We have begun studying a novel asynchronous nuclear division system in the multi - nucleated fungus A. gossypii . Neighbouring nuclei in the hyphae divide at different times despite close physical proximity. Utilizing time-lapse video micros - copy, we have generated nuclear pedigrees showing that most nuclei in A. gossypii cells have the capac - ity to divide but do so in nearly complete asynchrony. Analysis of spindle morphology suggests that neigh - boring nuclei exist in different stages of the cell cycle and that asynchrony is independent of cell shape. Additionally, asynchrony is a robust characteristic of the system and is regenerated rapidly upon release from an artificially generated synchronization. We showed that both G1 and mitotic cyclins co-exist in nuclei at all stages, and that Sic1p, the inhibitor of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK), may act as one oscillator because it is present in G1 to G2 nuclei but not during mitosis. Recently, we identified the A. gossypii S-phase cyclin as the only cyclin able to oscillate during the mitotic cycle. In addition, we also found that the A. gossypii homologue of Pds1 oscillates. These data represent the first molecular in vivo description of asynchronous mitoses in multi - nucleated cells and suggest that novel means of cell cycle regulation govern the nuclear division cycle in A. gossypii . In search of a link between morphogenesis and nuclear division in A. gossypii How mitosis is spatially regulated in a multinucleat - ed filamentous fungus is largely unknown. We study this problem in the ascomycete A. gossypii , which is closely related to S. cerevisiae on a genome scale. Yet, A. gossypii displays an entirely different pattern of growth, leading to branched filaments whose nu - clei multiply by asynchronous mitosis. This further raises the question whether, unlike in budding yeast, hyphal morphogenesis is independent of cell cycle stages in A. gossypii . In S. cerevisiae , the septins are thought to link bud formation to mitosis by re - cruiting Hsl1 and Hsl7, which are required for Swe1 inactivation and entry into mitosis. The proper as - sembly and organization of the septin collar at the neck is essential for the function of these cell cycle regulators. In A. gossypii , homologues to all key players of this morphogenesis checkpoint exist. To begin to investigate possible connections between the cell cycle and morphogenesis, we have focused on analyzing the structure and function of septin proteins in A. gossypii by using a Sep7-GFP strain. We detected some septin structures that were not described so far. Interestingly, most of the structures in A. gossypii seem to be composed of parallel bars, an instance which in yeast is only seen in certain mutants and is associated with higher Swe1 kinase activity. Heterologous expression of AgSep7-GFP in S. cerevisiae leads to the formation of normal yeast structures with continuous rings and double rings. This implies that the observed structures are not in - herent to the Sep7 protein, but rather the result of different regulation or interaction in the two organ - isms. Dynamics of the A. gossypii actin cytoskeleton In A. gossypii the actin cytoskeleton is composed of long bundles of filaments (actin cables) and small punctate structures (actin patches) localized to growth sites and required for polar growth. We anal - yse different components of the actin cytoskeleton which have been labelled with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) by means of video microscopy, study - ing their structural and dynamic properties. Cap1 and Cap2 are the subunits making up capping pro - tein which binds the barbed end of actin filaments and are - trated at the tip of hyphae, mostly cortical and in the subapical domain. Velocity measurements show that they are slower than actin patches in S. cerevisiae or S. pombe . Sequential recordings of the entire hy - pha show that the net movement of actin patches is backward. Co-stainings with the endocytosis marker FM4-64 show partial colocalization. These findings support the idea that actin patches are involved in endocytosis. Cap1-GFP and Cap2-GFP patches are immobilized by low doses of Latrunculin A, indicat - ing that actin polymerization may be their mode of propulsion. Actin cables were made visible by using a GFP tagged variant of Abp140, an actin binding with stainings. They are mostly cortical, often helical, and can be as long as 40 \u00b5m. Peter Philippsen39 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Cell Growth & Development They are very motile and show undulating move - ments. This is in contrast to the short, straight ac - tin cables in S. cerevisiae , which have been shown to transport exocytic vesicles to the site where a new cell wall is formed. These results suggest that the structural basis and mechanisms for polarized growth are similar in S. cerevisiae and A. gossypii , yet differ markedly in dynamic behaviour. Role of formins and RHO proteins for hyphal growth in A. gossypii Formin homology proteins are known nucleators of actin cables in many different organisms. We study AgBni1 a formin homology protein from A. gossypii . AgBni1 is essential for hyphal formation and might be involved in tip branching, as shown by deletion mutants and activated alleles. Deletion mutants of AgBni1 have a defect actin cytoskeleton and do not form mature hyphae. In contrast, cells carrying the activated allele show tip-branching prior to emer - gence of lateral branches, which is never observed in the wildtype. In addition, we identified four differ - ent members of the family of small Rho-type GTPas - es that are capable of binding to the AgBni1 protein and therefore might be regulators of the latter. To further investigate the role of these members of the Rho family we integrated activated alleles into the genome of A. gossypii . However no single activated rho-allele was capable to mimic the phenotype of an activated AgBni1 indicating that either several differ - ent GTPases or other so far unknown factors are necessary for activation of AgBni1. We have begun to study the role of two additional A. gossypii formins, AgBnr1 and AgBnr2 which most likely function at sites of septation. Single deletions are viable but the double deletion is lethal. A. gossypii homologues of S. cerevisiae BUD genes In S. cerevisiae , a series of so-called BUD genes has been identified which control establishment of new axis of polarity. The function of the Ashbya BUD1/RSR1 and BUD2 homologues were investi - gated by using time-lapse video microscopy. These movies revealed that AgBUD2 is important for a sta - ble growth axis of the elongating hyphae. AgRSR1/ BUD1 seems to play a role in the maintenance of hy - phal tip growth and in the elongation of initiated hy - phal branches. Ashbya hyphae lacking this gene fre - quently paused growth at the tip and showed many unsuccessful branching events. A. gossypii also carries homologues of proteins. We are interested in de - termining the role of these homologues in the fila - mentous growth pattern of A. gossypii . In contrast to A. gossypii wild type, in Agrax1 , Agrax2 and Agbud8 deletions up to four branches can simultaneously emerge from the main hypha, and additional new branches are formed between the already devel - oped ones. Tip growth of the main hypha is marked - ly reduced when branches start growing. An altered branching pattern was not observed in the Agbud7 deletion. AgRax2-GFP localizes at the tips of hypha and at the septum where it appears just after acto - myosin ring formation, and before chitin deposition. AgBud7-GFP is found in dot-like structures which oscillate. The observed structures are able to divide keeping a similar density throughout the hyphae. We will complete the analysis by using video micros - copy with different tip-located GFP marker proteins. ScBUD8 and ScBUD9 are twin genes (leftovers of the ancient whole genome duplication), and Ashbya carries a single homologue, AgBUD8/9 . The protein encoded by AgBUD8/9 is important for localization of AgRax2 to the growing tip. Activity of syntenic A. gossypii promoters Due to a high degree of synteny, our two model or - ganisms represent an ideal system to study the con - servation of entire promoters and promoter elements. A selection of promising A. gossypii promoters were chosen and fused to a promoterless GFP reporter gene. Evaluation of syntenic A. gossypii promoter strengths in S. cerevisiae revealed that 44% of the promoters tested exhibited significant green fluores - cence. Two of those promoters, ENO2P and PFK2P , can be used as new heterologous promoters in S. cerevisiae. In order to identify conserved promoter elements we compared the A. homologues. Interestingly, we observed a high frequency of order conservation between A. gossypii and S. cerevisiae transcription factor binding sites. In contrast to that, the distances between the individual sites varied considerably be - tween the two species. Peroxisome formation via a novel ER pathway Impairment of peroxisomal function is the cause of a number of diseases in humans ranging from single enzyme deficiencies to severe syndromes in which peroxisomes are completely absent. Peroxisome functions in fatty acid metabolism are quite well characterized but how peroxisomes are formed in eukaryotic cells is unknown. Both human and yeast Peter Philippsen40 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Cell Growth & Development cells lacking peroxisomes due to mutations in PEX3 or PEX19 genes regenerate the organelles upon re - introduction of the corresponding wild-type version. To evaluate how and from where new peroxisomes are formed, we followed the trafficking route of new - ly made YFP-tagged Pex3 and Pex19 proteins (an integral mem - brane protein) could first be observed in the endo - plasmic reticulum (ER), where it concentrates in foci that then bud off in a Pex19-dependent manner and mature into fully functional peroxisomes. Pex19 (a farnesylated, mostly cytosolic protein) enriches first at the Pex3 foci on the ER and then on the maturing peroxisomes. This trafficking route of Pex3-YFP is the same in wild-type cells. These results demon - strate that peroxisomes are generated from domains in the ER.

Proteins of the endo - plasmic reticulum (ER), the Golgi apparatus, the plasma membrane, the endosomal/lysosomal sys - tem and the cell exterior are all first targeted to the ER, translocated across the membrane or inserted into the lipid bilayer, and then distributed via the se - cretory pathway. Our research focuses on (1) how membrane proteins are inserted into the ER mem - brane and acquire a defined topology, and (2) how transport vesicles are formed at the trans-Golgi or endosomes, or entirely in vitro . Topogenesis of membrane proteins Hydrophobic signal sequences target proteins to the ER membrane where the translocon mediates the passage of hydrophilic sequences across the mem - brane and the integration of apolar tran s membrane segments into the lipid bilayer. In the process, the topology of the polypeptide a chain is determined, i.e. the orientation of the signal and of subsequent transmembrane segments with respect to the mem - brane. We are studying the determinants and the process of topogenesis in vivo by challenging mammalian cells with diagnostic mutant proteins. Signal orientation is determined by the flanking charges, hydrophobic - ity, and folding of N-terminal sequences. The results also suggest that the signal is exposed to the lipid membrane during topogenesis. In parallel, we analyze the translocon in yeast by random and site-directed mutagenesis to generate mutants affected in topogenesis. The results indicate a role of the plug domain of Sec61p in topogenesis, probably by appropriately gating the channel. In ad - dition, the plug is important for efficient assembly of the hetero-oligomeric translocon complex.Membrane protein topogenesis and intracellular protein sorting Martin Spiess Tel. +41 61 267 21 64 Fax +41 61 267 21 49 martin.spiess@unibas.ch www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/spiess Group Members Nicole Beuret Pascal Crottet Marie Tina Junne Bieri Visiting Scientist J.

Clathrin coats with different adaptor proteins (APs) are involved in transporting cargo proteins with characteristic tyrosine and dileucine motifs in various intracellular pathways. We have de - veloped an assay using permeabilized cells to study the molecular requirements for the recycling of in - ternalized receptors back to the plasma membrane. Manipulation of the cytosol used for reconstitution revealed that formation of recycling vesicles requires AP-1/clathrin coats and is regulated by rab4 and the connector rabaptin-5. The assay is being adapted to also analyze vesicle formation at the trans-Golgi network. To study the mechanism of coat formation, we re - constitute the recruitment of purified coat compo - nents to chemically defined liposomes presenting corresponding sorting peptides. AP-1 adaptors are recruited in the presence of specific lipids, Arf1\u00b7GTP, and sorting signals. They were found to oligomer - ize even in the absence of clathrin and to dissociate upon GTP hydrolysis induced stimulates ArfGAP1 activity, suggesting a role AP-1 in the regulation of the Arf1 \"GTPase timer\". Interaction with cargo re - duces the rate of GTP hydrolysis, thus contributing to efficient cargo sorting. Secretory granules The peptide hormone vasopressin is synthesized as a precursor protein, sorted into secretory gran - ules, and released from the neurohypophysis in a regulated manner to control water reabsorption in the kidney. In collaboration with Jonas Rutishauser (University Hospital, Basel), we study how muta - tions cause familial central Diabetes insipidus, a dominant degenerative disease. Mutant proteins are retrotranslocated to the cytosol and degraded by the proteasome. A cytotoxicity assay is being developed to identify the mechanism of dominance. In the course of these experiments, we discovered that expression of several regulated secretory pro - teins in nonendocrine cells generates granule-like structures which resemble secretory granules mor - phologically and biochemically. Co-expression stud - ies show that granins enhance the efficiency of their formation and modulate their morphology. The re - sults suggest that initial granule formation requires no additional machinery specific to regulated secre - tory cells besides the regulated cargo itself, and that granins have a supportive role in the process.

Thus, around a very focused central theme, the groups develop competence and collabo - rations covering many different and complementary aspects of the biology of infection. The expertise in - cludes microbial genetics, cell biology, immunology, biochemistry, fluorescence and electron microscopy, and microarrays. Extensive collaborations are taking place with our colleagues from the Core Programs \"Structural Biol - ogy and Biophysics\" as well as \"Genome Scale Biol - ogy and Bioinformatics\". The impact of this Research goes beyond the spe - cific field of microbial pathogenesis, addressing ba - sic questions in Biology such as the regulatory prin - ciples in nanomachines assembly (length control for instance), DNA transfer between microorganisms and the role of protein kinases in intracellular trans - port processes in macrophages. Highlights In 2003 the Cornelis group discovered that the length of the needle of the Yersinia injectisome (Type III se - cretion apparatus) is determined by a protein acting as a molecular ruler (see Report 2002-2003). Now, they showed that the needle must have a certain length to match the length of other macromolecules at the surface of the bacterium and the target animal cell ( Science , 2005, 307:1278). They also demon - strated that the tip of the needle has a distinct struc - ture made of protein LcrV and that this structure acts INTRODUCTION Full Professors Silvia Arber, Yves-Alain Barde, Karl G.

Education The members of the Focal Area \"Infection Biology\" together with U Jenal (Focal Area \"Growth and De - velopment\") organize a complete graduate teaching program on \"Infection Biology\" (Cycle A). The cycle was initiated during the 04-05 winter semester by a course on \"General Mechanisms of Microbial Patho - genesis\". A course on \"Major Microbial Diseases and Vaccine Development\" was taught during the sum - mer semester 05. A course on \"Microbial Cell Struc - tures and Drug Targets\" takes place during the 05-06 winter semester. The Focal Area also contributed to the Joint Degree in Infectious Diseases, Vaccinology and Drug Dis - covery\" organized by the Novartis Institute for Tropi - cal Diseases in Singapore (NITD), The University of Singapore, The Swiss Tropical Institute (Basel) and the Biozentrum. Finally, the Focal Area organized a weekly seminar and a monthly Journal Club. Focal Area Infection Biology46 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 200 4-200 5Infection Biology Type III secretion in Yersinia We are studying type III secretion (T3S), a complex weapon, encountered in more than twenty animal, plant and insect Gram-negative pathogens. It con - sists of a nanosyringe derived from the flagellum (the injectisome) and an array of effector proteins. Bacteria docked at the surface of a eukaryotic host cell or included within a vacuole inject the effectors across the cellular membrane, into the cytosol of the host cell. The effectors disarm the cell, sabotage its communications or reprogram the cell to the benefit of the pathogen. The Ysc-Yop system from Yersinia (Y. enterocolitica , Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis ) represents an archetype of T3S systems. The Ysc injectisome al - lows extra cellular bacteria to inject six different ef - fectors called Yops into the cytosol of macrophages. Yops interrupt the signaling cascades triggering phagocytosis and the inflammatory response. The injectisome is made of 35 different proteins. It con - sists of a basal body embedded in the two bacte - rial membranes and the petidoglycan, extended by a 60-nm needle protruding outside the bacterial surface. The basal body contains the recognition and export apparatus, energized by an ATPase of the AAA+ family. Interestingly, this export apparatus serves to export the needle subunits during the as - sembly phase. It also serves to export LcrV, YopB and YopD, three proteins which are required for the formation of a translocation pore in the membrane of the target cell. The relation between the needle and the pore is still unclear (Figure 1). During the 2004-2005 period, our work focused mainly on the structure and assembly of the needle, the assembly of the translocation pore and the role of specific in - trabacterial chaperones called the Syc (Specific Yop chaperones) proteins. The needle length is controlled by a protein (YscP), which acts as a molecular ruler (see report 2002- 2003). In 2004-2005, we demonstrated that the C-ter - minal domain of YscP switches the substrate-speci - ficity of the export machine from early substrates (like needle subunits) to late substrates (Yops) when the assembly of the needle is completed. YscP is thus a ruler triggering a switch. The ruler protein (YscP) is exported by the growing injectisome dur - ing the assembly process. We showed that the ruler needs to be exported to exert an accurate length control. This observation strengthens the model for length control that we proposed in 2003. According to this model, the ruler resides within the growing needle, anchored by its N-terminus and gradually Molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis of Yersinia sp and Capnocytophaga canimorsus Guy R.

When the needle has reached its final length, the C-terminal domain switches the substrate specificity and the ruler is re - leased. We localized the export signal of YscP and discoverd that YscP is endowed with two different N-terminal export signals. Both are different from the export signals of the Yops, showing that the injecti - some recognizes two different kinds of export sig - nals; \"early\" and \"late\" export signals. Finally, we asked the question why the needle length needs to be defined. By modulating the length of YscP, we engineered needles of different lengths and tested their efficacy. We observed that needles longer than normal are functional while needles that are shorter than normal are not. We then combined these needle constructs with three variants of the outer membrane protein YadA exhibiting also differ - ent sizes. We observed that short needles are func - tional in association with short molecules of YadA and that normal needles are less functional in as -sociation with longer molecules of YadA. We con - cluded that the needle length is adjusted in order to match different structures present at the surface of the bacterium (adhesin, lipopolysaccharide,...) and probably also the host cell. For the assembly of the translocation pore, we first demonstrated that LcrV is required for the forma - tion of the pore. Then, in collaboration with I. Attree (Grenoble), we demonstrated that YopB and YopD are inserted into the target cell membrane but that LcrV is not, suggesting that it could act as a plat - form or scaffold for the assembly of the translocation pore made of YopB and YopD. In excellent agree - ment with this hypothesis, in collaboration with the group of A. Engel (Biozentrum), we discovered that LcrV forms a distinct structure, made of a head, a neck and a ring, at the tip of the needle (Figure 2). These observations explain the role of LcrV in pore formation and explain also why LcrV acts as a major protective antigen against plague. Many effectors are associated with a specific Syc chaperone while they are stored inside the bacte - rium, prior to contact with a target. When the Yop is exported by the injectisome, the chaperone is re - moved by the ATPase and recycled inside the bacte - rium. The structure of such chaperones and the way they interact with their substrate is well character -Guy R. Cornelis Figure 1: Left: The Yersinia injectisome, prior to contact with a target cell. The basal body is made of two rings linked with a rod. The needle protrudes from the bacte - rial surface. Prior to their export, the effectors are bound to specific chaperones. Right: the injectisome in action. A pore made of YopB and YopD allows translocation of the effectors across the target cell plasma membrane. During the 2004-2005 period, we studied the relation between the needle and the pore. Figure 2: LcrV forms a structure at the tip of the needle of the Yersinia injectisome.

During the 2004-2005 period, we discovered and charac - terized SycO, a new chaperone for the YopO. The chaperone binding domain (CBD) within YopO coincides the membrane localiza - tion domain (MLD) targeting YopO to the host cell membrane. In the absence of SycO, the CBD/MLD causes intrabacterial YopO insolubility. The binding of SycO prevents the aggregation of YopO but not folding and activity of the kinase. The CBD/MLD is not essential for YopO kinase activity. Thus, SycO masks, inside the bacterium, an aggregation-prone domain needed for proper YopO localization in the host cell. We propose that covering a MLD might be the essential function not only of SycO but also of other effector-chaperones. Capnocytophaga canimorsus In 2004, we initiated the study of the pathogenesis of Capnocytophaga canimorsus , a Gram-negative bacterium from the Order of Flavobacteria, commonly found in dog's mouths. It is responsible for fatal sep - ticemia or meningitis after dog bites. In 2004-2005, we generated and sequenced two genomic libraries. The coverage is about 6.5 fold but the assembly of the contigs is still in progress. An overview of case reports suggests that the bacterium induces little in - flammation during the early stages of the infection, until overwhelming bacterial growth and spread final - ly causes shock or meningitis. We characterized the inflammatory response of human and mouse macro - phages upon C. canimorsus infection. Analysis of ten different strains of C. canimorsus showed absence of TNF-alpha and IL-1alpha release by infected mouse macrophages. Live and heat-killed Cc5, a strain iso - lated from fatal septicemia, did not induce IL-6, IL-8, IFN-gamma, MIP-1beta and nitric oxide in mouse and human macrophages. Failure of macrophages to pro - mote inflammatory response coincided with the lack of NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) activation as well as the inability of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to recognize and respond to Cc5. Moreover, Cc5 actively blocked release of TNF-alpha and nitric oxide, resulting in down regulation of TLR4 expression and dephosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Our findings highlight \"passive\" and \"active\" mechanisms of immune evasion by C. canimorsus , which may ex - plain its capacity to subvert and escape from the host immune system. During the 2004-2005 period, we have also devel - oped an array of genetic tools for the study of C. cani - morsus . This allowed us to generate a library of inser - tion mutants that will be screened for mutants unable to block the inflammatory response. Publications Agrain, C., Callebaut, I., Journet, L., L.J.

Cornelis50 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 200 4-200 5Infection Biology The aim of our studies is to understand the molec - ular function of type IV secretion (T4S) systems in bacterial pathogenesis. The T4S systems of patho - genic bacteria have evolved from bacterial conjuga - tion systems, which mediate the efficient spread of genetic traits, such as antibiotic resistance genes, among bacteria. Bacterial pathogens targeting eu - karyotic host cells have adapted these DNA transfer systems for the delivery of virulence factors. A su - pramolecular assembly of 12 proteins is thought to span both Gram-negative bacterial membranes and the host cell membrane, allowing translocation of vir - ulence factors from the bacterial cytoplasm directly into the host cell cytoplasm. An increasing number of human pathogenic bacteria uses T4S systems for the intracellular delivery of effector proteins that modify host cellular functions in favor of the patho - gen. However, important questions regarding the molecular mechanism of T4S and the specific role of the translocated bacterial effector proteins within host cells have remained unanswered. Our recent work on the pathogenesis of the tumor-inducing bac - teria of the genus Bartonella revealed central roles of two distinct T4S systems, VirB/VirD4 and Trw, in the ability of bacteria to colonize, invade and persist within vascular endothelial cells and erythrocytes, respectively. The identification of effector proteins transported by the VirB/VirD4 T4S system and the delineation of their secretion signal allowed us to better understand Bartonella -host cell interaction and modulation, as well as the molecular mecha - nistic aspects of T4S. Furthermore, the use of the delineated secretion signal for efficient intracellular delivery of engineered substrates into human cells may lead to an exploitation of T4S systems for novel therapeutic approaches. Two distinct T4S systems are required for estab - lishing Bartonella infection in vivo The genus Bartonella comprises a large number of human and animal pathogens. Common features of bartonellae include transmission by blood-suck - ing arthropods and the specific interaction with en - dothelial cells and erythrocytes of their mammalian hosts. For each Bartonella species, the invasion and persistent intracellular colonization of erythrocytes is limited to a specific human or animal reservoir host. In contrast, endothelial cells serve as target cells in probably all mammals, including incidentally infected humans in the case of the animal-specific species (zoonotic infections). Laboratory rats experimentally infected with Bartonella tribocorum serve as a model for studying the characteristic intraerythrocytic bacte - remia of bartonellae in their specific reservoir host.

Schirmer (Biozentrum Biennial Report 200 4-200 5Infection Biology this model, bacteria initially colonize a primary infec - tion niche, which is composed of endothelial cells and potentially other target cell types. Within this primary niche, bacteria become competent for the subse - quent invasion of erythrocytes, which occurs in char - acteristic intervals of ~5 days. A large-scale screen of 3084 signature-tagged transposon mutants of B. tribocorum allowed us to identify 99 bacterial genes essential for establishing intraerythrocytic bacteremia in rats (Saenz and Dehio, 2005). Fifteen of these essential pathogenicity genes map to the loci encoding the T4S systems VirB/VirD4 and Trw, highlighting earlier findings of our lab on the impor - tance of these T4S systems for Bartonella pathogen - esis. Importantly, the VirB/VirD4 system is required for infection of the primary niche, i.e. endothelial cells, while the Trw system appears to be essential for the subsequent infection of erythrocytes (Schr\u00f6der and Dehio, 2005). The VirB/VirD4 T4S causes an asymptomatic intraerythrocytic bacteremia in the feline reservoir host, while it represents an important pathogen in incidentally infected humans. Remark - ably, the broad range of disease manifestations in - cludes proliferative disorders of the vascular endo - thelium resulting in the formation of vascular tumors (Dehio, 2005). We use primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as an in vitro model for studying this subversion of human endothelial cell functions by B. henselae . Interestingly, virB4 mu- tants lacking a functional VirB/VirD4 T4S system were incapable of mediating most of the known physiological changes associated with B. henselae infection of HUVEC. These include (i) massive re - arrangements of the actin cytoskeleton, resulting in the formation and internalization of large bacterial aggregates, (ii) nuclear factor kappa B-dependent pro-inflammatory activation, leading to cell adhesion molecule expression and chemokine secretion, and (iii) inhibition of apoptotic cell death, resulting in en - hanced endothelial cell survival. Moreover, the VirB/ VirD4 T4S system mediated cytostatic and cytotoxic effects at high bacterial titers, which interfered with the potent VirB/VirD4-independent mitogenic activity of B. henselae (Schmid et al., 2004). Taken together, the VirB/VirD4 T4S system was shown to be a major virulence determinant of B. henselae , required for targeting multiple endothelial cell functions exploited by this vasculotropic pathogen in the course of tu - mor formation (Fig. 1). Intracellular protein delivery by the VirB/VirD4 T4S system mediates subversion of endothelial cell functions In the course of characterizing the virB/virD4 locus, we identified 7 adjacent genes that encode effector proteins translocated by the VirB/VirD4 T4S sys - tem into human endothelial cells. These Bartonella - translocated effector proteins (BepA-BepG) partly translocation signal, while their heterologous N - terminus is considered to serve effector functions after translocation into en - dothelial cells. Three of the seven Bep proteins carry conserved tyrosine phosphorylation motifs in this effector domain and become phosphorylated upon translocation into endothelial cells. Deletion of the locus encoding the Bep proteins resulted in a mutant phenotype indistinguishable from mutants lacking a functional VirB/VirD4 T4S system, demonstrating that the Bep proteins mediate all T4S system-depen - dent changes of endothelial cell function (Fig. 1) The C-terminal translocation signal of the Bep pro - teins is bipartite, including a novel domain of ap - proximately 140 amino acids termed BID ( Bep intra- cellular delivery) followed at the very C-terminus by an unconserved tail sequence, which carries a net positive charge. Hidden-Markov models allowed us to identify BID domains also in several DNA-trans - fer proteins (relaxases) of plasmid-borne conjuga - tion systems (e.g. of the Agrobacterium tumfaciens AvhB/TraG system), suggesting a recent history of adaptive evolution of the Bartonella VirB/VirD4 pro - tein transfer system from these related conjugative DNA-transfer systems (Fig. 1).Christoph Dehio Figure the Bartonella system VirB/VirD4 subvert human endothelial cell functions. 52 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 200 4-200 5Infection Biology Fusion proteins composed of the C-terminal trans - location signal of BepD and a heterologous reporter protein (e.g. the Cre recombinase of phage P1 or the Cya adenylate cyclase of Bordetella pertussis ) were efficiently delivered by the VirB/VirD4 T4S system into human endothelial cells, demonstrating that the C-terminal translocation signal of the Bep proteins can be used for intracellular delivery of engineered protein substrates. Attenuated B. henselae strains may thus be used in humans for the intracellular tar - geting of proteins of therapeutic value, e.g. for the treatment of vascular disorders or for vaccine deliv - ery (Sch\u00fclein et al. , 2005).

J Biol Chem 279, of Basel Biennial Report 200 4-200 5Infection Biology When an organism is invaded by microbes, an im - mune response has to be established to clear the host from the invading microorganisms. Elimination of infectious agents is first of all ensured by the in - nate immune system. For extracellular pathogens, the defense consists largely of phagocytes that non- specifically engulf the microorganisms and destroy these within lysosomes. Degradation of the infec - tious agents also leads to the generation of frag - ments that can be displayed to T lymphocytes by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules, resulting in T cell activation and generation of spe - cific immune responses. My laboratory is interested in i) the intracellular traf - ficking events involved in the internalization and degradation of antigens and ii) the mechanisms that result in a proper T cell response. Many pathogenic microorganisms have gained the capacity to circum - vent the effectiveness of the immune response at several levels, and a major focus of the laboratory is to decipher the mechanisms that are used by patho - gens to escape immune recognition. Antigen Internalization in Professional Antigen Presenting Cells Presentation of antigens to T lymphocytes involves the entry and degradation of proteins and lipid mol - ecules for presentation to T cells. One particular ef - ficient internalization route occurs via macropinocy - tosis, which in addition can result in delivery of the antigens to the cytosol for presentation of antigenic fragments within the context of MHC class I mole - cules. This latter process, termed cross presentation, is crucial for the generation of immunity against virus- infected and tumor cells. We have analyzed the entry route for antigens internalized via macropinocytosis and found an essential role of the plasma membrane component cholesterol in macropinocytosis. Interaction of Pathogenic Mycobacteria with Mammalian Cells Several microorganisms have gained the capacity to invade and survive within mammalian host cells. Mycobacteria have the ability to enter and survive within eukaryotic cells, by preventing phagosome- lysosome fusion, making this an excellent model system to study both the pathogen-host interaction as well as the biochemical events involved in regu - lating transport events inside the host cell. We are interested in both the host as well as the mycobacte - rial factors contributing to mycobacterial survival.Analyzing the Interaction of Pathogens with the Host Immune System Jean Pieters Phone +41 61 267 14 94 Fax +41 61 267 21 49 jean.pieters@unibas.ch Switzerland); Charles Thompson & Liem Nguyen (Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of British Columbia, Canada), Paul Jen\u00f6, Daniela Nebenius-Oosthuizen 4-200 5Infection Biology Macrophage Factors involved in the Modulation of Intracellular Trafficking Analysis of the constituents of mycobacterial phago - somes revealed the accumulation of a host protein, termed coronin 1 or TACO (for tryptophane aspar- tate containing coat protein) that is a crucial factor for mycobacterial survival inside macrophages. In the absence of coronin 1, mycobacteria are readily transferred to lysosomes. We have biochemically characterized the organiza - tion of coronin 1 molecules. We showed that coronin 1 are coiled-coil-mediated homotrimeric complexes which associate with the plasma membrane and with the actin cytoskeleton via two distinct binding domains. Association of coronin 1 with the actin cytoskeleton is mediated by C-terminal coiled-coil domain. In collaboration with Michel Steinmetz (Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen CH) we have defined the crystal structure of the coiled coil domain of coronin 1, that we found to be a three stranded -helical coiled coil. Within this coiled coil, a motif was found containing a critical arginine residue that is conserved in in - tracellular, extracellular, transmembrane, viral, and synthetic proteins harboring short trimeric domains; These findings contribute towards estab - lishing sequence-to-structure rules for predicting coiled coils encoded in entire genomes and will also be of interest for viral drug development strategies. In the absence of the coiled-coil domain, plasma membrane binding of coronin 1 still occurs suggest - ing that this is mediated by the N-terminal, WD re - peat-containing domain. The capacity of coronin-1 to link F-actin filaments to the leukocyte plasma mem - brane may serve to integrate outside-inside signal - ling with modulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Mycobacterial Factors involved in the Modula - tion of Intracellular trafficking Besides the host factors involved in mycobacterial survival, we are analyzing the bacterial factors that allow pathogenic mycobacteria to survive within macrophages. We found that treatment of Mycobac - terium bovis BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, which is the vaccine strain used as a model organism) with a eukaryotic protein kinase C a inhibitor prior to infec - tion of macrophages lead to an immediate transport of the mycobacteria to lysosomes suggesting the in - volvement of a PKC a-like kinase activity in blocking lysosomal delivery. Interestingly, eleven different eu -karyotic-like protein kinases are encoded by patho - genic mycobacteria. Whereas most of the mycobac - terial kinases are predicted to be transmembrane proteins with an intracellular kinase domain, two of these, protein kinase G and protein kinase K lack such a transmembrane segment. Interestingly, pro - tein kinase G is retained in the downsized genome of the obligate intracellular pathogen M. leprae that carries the minimum set of mycobacterial genes necessary for intracellular survival. To analyze a role for protein kinase G in mycobacterial survival inside host cells, we disrupted protein kinase G in M. bovis BCG using phage-mediated homologous nation. The resulting M. bovis BCG pknG -deletion mutant was immediately transferred to lysosomes and the mutant mycobacteria were unable to survive inside macrophages, defining protein kinase G as a crucial mycobacterial virulence factor (Figure 1). Kinases are attractive drug targets, and in collabo - ration with Axxima (Munich, Germany) a protein ki - nase G inhibitor was characterized. This compound was able to induce transfer of mycobacteria to lyso - somes and to mediate killing of mycobacteria inside macrophages. One possible advantage of targeting protein kinase G from pathogenic mycobacteria is that this will allow the macrophage to carry out its natural antibacterial activity of redirecting intracel - lularly surviving mycobacteria to lysosomes. Thus, pathogenic mycobacteria have evolved eukaryotic- like signal transduction mechanisms capable of modulating host cell trafficking pathways. Together, this work will help to understand how pathogenic mycobacteria evade the normal host immune re - sponses. In addition, this work cytosed by macrophages remain outside lysosomal or - ganelles (in red) (upper panels). However, when the eu - karyotic-like serine/threonin kinase Protein Kinase G is deleted in these bacteria, they are readily transported to lysosomes (lower panels).

The ner - vous system must be capable of storing, integrating and retrieving information using mechanisms that are still poorly understood, but surely depend on the establishment of precise connections. How neurons form meaningful functional circuits is an intriguing question that is not only of interest to developmental neurobiologists, but also of great significance in the context of diseases and injury of the nervous sys - tem. For example, there is little growth of axons in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) after injury in the adult, and when neurons die or fail to efficiently contact other cells, the brain is unable to store or retrieve memories, as illustrated for example in the disease of Alzheimer, a condition that affects a large proportion of the aging population in industrial - ized countries. The fine-tuning of synaptic connec - tions and the homeostasis between excitatory and inhibitory inputs is also frequently perturbed in neu - rological diseases, including epilepsy in particular. A better knowledge of the mechanisms controlling the assembly and function of neuronal networks is thus desirable as it will significantly contribute to the un - derstanding of diseases of the nervous system. Education The members of the Focal Area organize and teach a graduate and post-graduate program in Neurobi - ology. This includes a series of formal introductory lectures in Neurobiology, a 2-week intense program including practical work, as well as a Journal Club series both at the FMI and at the Biozentrum. In addi - tion, a weekly, 2-h lecture series is organised on Cur - rent Topics in Neurobiology, as well as weekly semi - nars with invited speakers. This teaching program includes the active participation of a large number of members of the Basel Neuroscience Program, in particular neurobiologists working at the FMI and for pharmaceutical companies.

A deep knowledge about the logic of how neuronal circuits are being assembled during development and which molecules are in - volved in the establishment of neuronal circuits may contribute to our understanding of the functioning of the mature nervous system. The main focus of our studies is to determine the principles of neuronal circuit formation in the developing vertebrate spinal cord. In the spinal monosynaptic reflex circuit many details of early neuronal specification as well as ma - ture connectivity are already well understood. This neuronal circuit thus represents an ideal system to study how different neuronal subpopulations are be - ing interconnected during development to establish mature neuronal circuits. In our studies, we mainly focus on the development of motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and Ia proprioceptive afferents in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which estab - lish monosynaptic connections with motor neurons (Ia afferents; Figure 1). Function of ETS transcription factors in the as - sembly of the vertebrate monosynaptic reflex circuit In previous studies, we have identified two molecular pathways that link specific peripherally derived sig - nals to the induction of the ETS transcription factors Pea3 and Er81 in defined subsets of motor neurons ganglia (DRG) sensory neu - rons (Er81). Furthermore, we found that these retro - grade signals from an intermediate target region act selectively to control the progressive specification Neuronal circuit assembly in the developing spinal cord Fig. 1: Schematic representation of the mature spinal monosynaptic reflex circuit.

In a recent study, we have addressed the question of how the temporal precision in the expression and activity of an ETS transcription factor controls the as - sembly of a neuronal circuit. We were able to show that upregulation of ETS transcription factor signal - ing specifically at a late stage of proprioceptive DRG sensory neuron differentiation is important to fulfill the appropriate developmental function (Hippen - meyer et al., 2005). We found that premature ETS signaling interferes with establishment of neuronal projections, acquisition of terminal neuronal traits and dependence on neurotrophic support (Figure 2). In contrast, late expression of the identical ETS tran - scriptional regulator in the same neuronal lineage can substitute for ETS gene function and promote neuronal differentiation. Together, these findings suggest that DRG sensory neurons undergo a tem - poral developmental switch, revealed by distinct re - sponses to ETS transcription factor signaling at se - quential steps of neuronal maturation (Hippenmeyer et al., 2005). Runx Transcription Factors and DRG Neuron Specification Neuronal differentiation involves the acquisition of many specialized molecular properties that are es - sential for later neuronal function. The emergence of distinct subpopulations of DRG neurons is controlled by the selective activation of distinct transcriptional programs. Yet the transcriptional mechanisms that control the fragmentation of neuronal classes into distinct subtypes of primary sensory neurons remain obscure. In a screen to identify genes selectively expressed by functionally distinct subpopulations of DRG neu - rons, we identified two members of the Runx family of transcription factors et al., 2006; Figure 3). Using genetic approaches in the mouse we have examined whether Runx transcription factor activity contributes to the acquisition of selective profiles of neurotrophic factor receptor and neuropeptide ex - pression in different subpopulations of DRG sensory neurons, traits associated with functionally distinct neuronal subpopulations that ensure the maturation of these distinct sensory neuron subtypes. We found that runt domain transcription factor signaling plays Silvia Arber Fig. 2: Culture of DRG isolated from wild-type embryos (top; wild-type) or embryos with premature ETS signaling (bottom; mutant) cultured without neurotrophic support (left) or in presence of NGF (right). Note that mutant DRG neurons survive and grow axons in the absence of neuro - trophic support. For details see Hippenmeyer et al., 2005. Fig. 3: Runx transcription factor expression in defined sub - populations of DRG neurons. In embryonic DRG neurons, Runx3 expression coincides with Parvalbumin and marks proprioceptive afferents (A). In contrast, Runx1 expression does not overlap with Parvalbumin and marks cutaneous afferents (B). For details see Kramer et al., 2006.59 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Neurobiology an essential role in the emergence of key aspects of subpopulation character in sensory neurons, ap - parently by repression of alternate traits. Specifically, we found that Runx3 controls the establishment of a proprioceptor phenotype by promoting a selective TrkC phenotype through erosion expression, whereas Runx1 expression TrkA+ cutaneous afferents represses the expression of the neuropep - tide CGRP (Kramer et al., 2006). Our findings therefore provide evidence that Runx transcription factor signaling controls three critical elements of DRG neuronal phenotype: neurotrophin sensitivity, peptidergic neurotransmitter profile and axonal targeting. Thus Runx proteins serve as key transcriptional intermediaries in the assignment of the functional features of DRG sensory neuron sub - classes that underlie the early steps of somatosen - sory processing (Kramer et al., 2006). Functional Analysis of Repulsive Guidance Mol - ecule (RGM) Family Members in the Mouse Repulsive Guidance Molecule ( RGM ) had been im - plicated in the control of topography of retinal gan - glion cell (RGC) axon termination zones along the anterior-posterior axis of the chick tectum. The mo - lecular identification of RGM has recently opened the way for functional studies in the mouse. We found that there are three mouse proteins homolo - gous to chick RGM (Niederkofler et al., 2004). Two members of this gene family ( mRGMa and mRGMb ) are expressed in complementary patterns in the nervous system, including the spinal cord and supe - rior colliculus (Niederkofler et al., 2004). Functional studies in the mouse revealed a role for mRGMa in controlling cephalic neural tube closure but not an - terior-posterior targeting of RGC axons to their ste - reotypic termination zones in the superior colliculus (Niederkofler et al., 2004). The third member of the family ( mRGMc ) is ex - pressed in skeletal muscles. Moreover, within the liver mouse mRGMc is selectively expressed by periportal hepatocytes (Niederkofler et al ., 2005). Our recent analysis of mRGMc mutant mice re - vealed that mRGMc is involved in the control of iron metabolism and its mutation leads to juvenile hemo - chromatosis, a frequently fatal disease with early onset iron accumulation and absence of hepcidin expression (Niederkofler et al., 2005). Our findings therefore define a key role for mRGMc in dietary iron-sensing and also reveal that cytokine-induced inflammation regulates hepcidin expression an & Arber, S. (2004).

Neuron 49, 379- 393.60 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Neurobiology Scope of research We are interested in the molecular pathways con - trolling neuronal survival, axonal elongation and ac - tivity-dependent plasticity in higher vertebrates. To understand mechanisms relevant to development and diseases of the nervous system, we use neuro - trophins and their receptors as dissecting tools, as well as cellular assays based on mouse embryonic stem cells. Neurotrophins In mammals, the 4 members of the neurotrophin gene family are involved in virtually all aspects of the biology of neurons. These include the control of cell survival and of axonal elongation, as well as neuro - transmission and activity-dependent modification of synaptic function. While this field of research has its conceptual and experimental origin in development biology, there is increasing interest in the role of neurotrophins in the adult nervous system, both in - tact and after lesion. For example, the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR plays a significant role in inhibiting axonal elongation and in causing cell death during development. But in the adult, this receptor is re- expressed by many neurons following lesions such as axotomy, brain ischemia and epilepsy. P75NTR is also known to bind a number of ligands others than neurotrophins, including a viral envelope glycopro - tein and the plaque-forming peptide A, thus further suggesting a link between this receptor and patholo - gies of the nervous system. With regard to the neu - rotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a range of intriguing observations links the levels of expression of this neurotrophin with complex behav - ioural patterns in rodents, including the regulation of food intake and with experimental models of depres - sion, and in human, with episodic memory. We re - cently generated mice that can reach the adult state while lacking BDNF following the selective deletion of the gene in neurons. These mice should be useful to better understand the role of BDNF in the adult nervous system, including the regulation of food in - take (studies in collaboration with the group of Karl Hofbauer at the Biozentrum). Embryonic Stem Cells We use extensively mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to complement with cellular assays our in vivo research. While these cells have an unlimited po - tential to divide they can also be selectively guided towards specific differentiation pathways.

This was made possible following the acciden - tal observation that ES cells can be directed to form an essentially pure population of a specific sub-type of neuronal precursors, namely Pax6-positive radial glial cells. Our ES cell-derived neurons respond to neurotrophins and we now use them to gain insight into the growth mediating effects of BDNF (work in collaboration with the groups of Markus Ruegg and Mike Hall at the Biozentrum). In addition, we engi - neered our ES cells to over-express p75NTR (see also illustration). This work has led to the establishment of a new model of axonal and dendrite degeneration and in collaboration with the proteomic group at Novartis, we are in the process of identifying proteins that may be causally involved in the death of neuronal proc - esses. Finally, we also use mutant ES cells lacking genes necessary for the development of the central nervous system. In particular, we found in collabora - tion with the group of Magdalena G\u00f6tz that ES cells lacking both functional copies of Pax6 develop dif - ferently from wild-type cells and that they generate inhibitory, as opposed to excitatory neurons. Also, these neurons were found to over-express p75NTR and to rapidly die in vitro. Upon re-examination of the Pax6 mutant cortex, we found that our in vitro findings could be verified in the developing cortex, thus suggesting that the ES cells differentiation sys - tem has a useful predictive value.

During the past two years the focus was on the treat - ment of cachexia by blockade of hypothalamic mela - nocortin-4 receptors (MC-4R). Cachexia is defined as a loss of fat and lean body mass in association with chronic diseases such as cancer or infections and is usually accompanied by inflammatory symp - toms. As an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality cachexia deserves medical attention and treatment. Dietary measures alone are not sufficient and pharmacotherapy is required. However, the cur - rently available drugs are far from ideal and new pharmacological concepts are needed. Inflammatory mediators appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis of cachexia. Circulating or brain cytokines can influence appetite and body composition via activation of specific hypothalamic receptors. These central effects might constitute a final common pathway in the development of ca - chexia which could explain why the body responds to various different underlying diseases with the same syndrome. Pharmacological blockade of this pathway should therefore be a useful therapeutic approach in treating cachexia regardless of its origin (for further details see Figure 1). In collaboration with Santhera Pharmaceuticals AG in Liestal, various in vivo models were developed to validate the concept that blockade of MC-4R has beneficial effects in cachexia. These models include acute anorexia in lipopolysaccharide-treated rats and chronic cancer-induced cachexia in mice and can also be used to identify low molecular weight MC4-R antagonists and to characterize their acute effects on food intake. The chronic effects of MC-4R blockade on lean body mass were assessed with magnetic resonance relaxometry (MRR) in collabo - ration with Prof. Joachim Seelig's group. This project was supported by a grant from the Swiss Commis - sion for Technology and Innovation. Another approach to block the melanocortin path - way consisted in the active immunization of rats with peptide sequences derived from the extracellular do - mains of the MC-4R. The functional role of the pep - tide sequences used as antigens was evaluated by using surface plasmon resonance. In these experi - ments an interaction between the third extracellular loop and the N-terminus of the MC-4R was demon - strated. Both domains were also found to interact with the endogenous inverse agonist Agouti-related protein (AgRP). These results suggested that the N-New pharmacological concepts for the treatment of obesity and cachexia SILVIA ARBER Karl G.

It could therefore be an interesting tem - plate for the production of pharmacologically active antibodies. Immunization of rats with peptide sequences of the N-terminus indeed resulted in a phenotype which consisted of an increase in body weight and fat mass. The post mortem evaluation of these rats revealed hepatic steatosis, a finding consistent with the exis - tence of insulin resistance. Additional in vitro studies demonstrated that antibodies purified from the sera of these rats reduced the constitutive activity of the MC-4R, i.e. they acted as inverse agonists. Taken to - gether these results showed that blockade of MC-4R led to an obesity-like syndrome. While such an effect would be undesirable in normal subjects it could be of therapeutic benefit in patients with cachexia. Our immunization studies showed for the first time that it is possible to generate functionally active rat antibodies against extracellular domains of the MC- 4R which can be used as pharmacological tools. In order to prepare sufficient amounts of such antibod - ies for further in vivo studies, polyclonal antibodies against the N-terminal domain of the MC-4R have been raised in rabbits and experiments in mice have been initiated to prepare monoclonal antibodies. The immunization studies in mice will also provide information about changes in lean body mass as de - termined by MRR. The suitability of small interfering RNA (siRNA) for in vitro and in vivo studies on the MC-4R has been investigated. In these experiments it was shown that siRNA were equally effective as antisense oligonu - cleotides in knocking down MC-4R in vitro . However, they did not penetrate brain tissue after intracere - broventricular administration in vivo . Such problems may be overcome by improved solvents or vectors. Prolonged administration via osmotic minipumps could be another alternative to improve the efficacy of siRNA in vivo . A new project on the central melanocortin pathway was started a year ago, in collaboration with Prof. Yves Barde's group, to investigate the role of brain- derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as a downstream mediator of the MC-4R. Since activation of this re - ceptor affects not only energy intake and expendi - ture but also the cardiovascular system and sexual function, it would be interesting to identify specific mediators of each individual effect. This would make it possible to interact with these functions in a more Karl G. Hofbauer The hypothalamic melanocortin system plays an important role in the regulation of energy balance and is part of the leptin signalling pathway (black letters, solid lines). Leptin is a small protein produced in adipose tissue in relation to the number and size of fat cells. It is secreted into the blood and reaches the hypothalamus where it activates specific receptors in the arcuate nucleus. Activation of these re - ceptors results in an increased production of pro-opi - omelanocortin (POMC), a precursor for several peptides including a-melanocyte stimulating hormone ( a-MSH). This peptide acts on melanocortin-4 receptors (MC-4R) in the paraventricular nucleus which eventually leads to a reduction in appetite (anorexia) and an increase in energy expenditure. Another endogenous peptide, Agouti-related protein (AgRP), acts as an inverse agonist by reducing the constitutive activity of the MC-4R. Long-term stimulation of MC-4R induces a negative energy balance and a reduc - tion in body fat mass. As a consequence circulating levels of leptin decrease which limits the amount of weight loss. In chronic diseases associated with cachexia cytokines are increased as part of the host defence reaction and stimulate the melanocortin pathway via specific cytokine receptors in the hypothalamus (grey letters, broken lines). In contrast to the normal situation where plasma levels of leptin decrease after weight loss thereby providing a negative feedback signal, cytokine levels remain elevated as long as the underlying chronic disease persists. Thus anorexia is maintained and the loss of fat and lean body mass continues. Experimental and clinical observations support the concept that blockade of the melanocortin pathway could improve this situation. Overexpression of AgRP or elimination of MC-4R in transgenic or ko mice results in obesity. Spontaneous mutations of the MC-4 re - ceptor have been described in humans and cause severe forms of obesity. Such patients show increased height and elevated lean body mass. Similar changes occur in MC- 4R ko mice. These observations support the notion that pharmacological MC-4R blockade could be a promising therapeutic approach to restore fat and lean body mass in patients with cachexia. 64 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Neurobiology specific manner. Studies with monoclonal antibod - ies against BDNF and other neurotrophins are being done in isolated hypothalami in vitro and in chroni - cally cannulated rats in vivo to evaluate the role of these factors in response to MC-4R activation. The results of a first series of in vivo experiments showed that injection of BDNF monoclonal antibodies into the third cerebral ventricle of rats prevented the ano - rectic effect of an MC-4R agonist, while it had no in - fluence on that of a cannabinoid-1 receptor antago - nist, an agent considered to act independently of the MC-4R pathway. Further experiments are planned to evaluate which of the effects of MC-4R stimulation are mediated via BDNF. The results of our experiments were presented at na - tional and international meetings and are the subject of several publications. A book on \"Pharmacothera - py of Cachexia\" co-edited by Karl G.

The discussion of its role has explored a wide spectrum, ranging from its comparison to death, to its recognition as a prerequisite for men - tal and physical health, up to its appreciation as a promoter of human creativity. With the introduction of electroencephalography and electrophysiology in the 20th century, sleep became a subject of scientific research and was described as a heterogeneous, strictly organized series of physiological and behav - ioral states. Since then, it has been also established that sleep does not simply reflect a passively dimin - ished waking, but is actively stabilized by sleep-pro - moting and antagonized by wake-promoting centers in the brain. Insufficient sleep has important conse - quences on the architecture and stability of sleep and arousal states, and additionally results in a decline of attention and motivation, in reduced short- and long-term memory, and in disturbed mental health. In western societies, a significant fraction of the health costs are caused directly or indirectly by the conse - quences of insufficient sleep. However, the biologi - cal mechanisms by which sleep exerts beneficial ef - fects on brain functions are largely unknown. Recent approaches in behavioral and molecular neurosci - ence suggest that some of the beneficial effects of sleep manifest in genetic, developmental and circuit aspects of the establishment and remodeling of neu - ronal connections. Our long-term goal is to understand the roles of sleep in brain functions at the cellular level. Ideally, we would like to identify the targets of the benefi - cial effects of sleep on diverse aspects of cognitive performance. The principal strategies we have been applying is to sleep-deprive mice, and perform the electrophysiological analysis of neuronal properties in brain slices of control and of sleep-deprived ani - mals. So far, we have concentrated on synaptic plas - ticity in the hippocampus, which is a well established cellular correlate of learning. We also investigate ionic and synaptic mechanisms underlying thalamic function, in particular in relation to the generation of sleep-related neuronal oscillations. The thalamus is located at the interface between the sensory pe - riphery and the cortical processing centers and is important in distinct aspects of sensory information transfer during waking and in the generation of sleep states. We have established thalamic slice prepara - tions that have allowed, in the past years, to investi - gate some of the cellular correlates of thalamic func - tionsTowards the roles of sleep in neuronal functions SILVIA ARBER Anita L\u00fcthi Phone +41 61 267 22 46 Fax +41 61 267 22 08 anita.luthi@unibas.ch www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/anitaluethi Group Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Neurobiology We have achieved three major steps for further re - search on the role of sleep in brain function. 1. We have established a behavioral framework with - in which we are able to dissociate the role of sleep in brain function from confounding factors, such as stress, and prolonged sensory stimuli. 2. We have gained a mechanistic understanding of how neurons are capable of generating sleep-re - lated oscillations, to the level of functional signaling complexes between different ion channels and intra - cellular signaling systems. 3. We have developed an in vitro approach to study how higher-order thalamic nuclei, essential for higher aspects of sensory processing and attentive mecha - nisms, are synaptically interconnected. 1. A role for sleep in homeostatic synaptic plas - ticity and NMDA receptor function (C. Kopp) We have investigated the effects of sleep depriva - tion on homeostatic plasticity refers to the susceptibility of synapses to undergo plastic changes depending on their prior history of activity. Homeostasis of synaptic function ensures that synaptic strength is maintained within working ranges and prevented from reaching saturation. We found that a stress-free sleep deprivation alters ho - meostatic synaptic plasticity in adult mice within a few hours only ( Figure 1 ). After sleep deprivation, the induction of synaptic po - tentiation was more difficult, whereas the induction of synaptic depression was facilitated. Moreover, recovery sleep reversed the effects of sleep depri - vation. We could show that the alteration of homeo - static synaptic plasticity by sleep deprivation was not due to stress, nor to prolonged sensory exposure. Instead, it was caused by the lack of sleep. When in - vestigating potential mechanisms underlying the al - teration in homeostatic synaptic plasticity, we found that sleep deprivation induced a rapid and revers - ible change in the apparent subunit composition of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors targeted by synaptically released glutamate. Therefore, the con - sequences of a stress-free sleep deprivation appear to manifest, at least in part, in measurable altera - tions in excitatory synaptic transmission and plastic - ity in brain slices. Moreover, the data suggest that a molecular basis for decreased learning and memory capacities after insufficient sleep, and perhaps cog - nitive function more generally, may be found in the properties of NMDA receptors.2. Ionic mechanisms underlying sleep-related neuronal oscillations in normal and epileptic ani - mals (L. Cueni, S. Fr\u00e8re, M. Kuisle, N. Wanaver - becq) We have been interested in the cellular and sub - cellular mechanisms underlying slow-wave sleep generation in thalamus and, in the long-term, how these contribute to the potentiation of slow-wave sleep after sleep deprivation. By using thalamic slice preparations that spontaneously generate sleep-re - lated oscillations, we have studied the regulatory pathways intrinsic thalamic pacemaker currents (Fr\u00e8re and L\u00fcthi, 2004; Fr\u00e8re et al., 2004). A com - mon theme arising from our recent work is that neu - ronal oscillations in thalamic neurons are based on a tight functional coupling between the low-threshold Ca2+ channels, the specific Ca2+-dependent signal - ing elements, and the ionic channels acting as pace - makers for these oscillations. This is exemplified in both the thalamocortical cells and in the nucleus re - ticularis cells, the two key players in the generation of sleep-related oscillations. In thalamocortical cells, pacemaker currents are upregulated by cAMP that is produced via the Ca2+ entering during thalamic os - cillatory burst discharges. This upregulation and its subsequent decay determine the periodic initiation and cessation of oscillatory burst discharges dur - ing sleep spindle waves and, in part, delta-rhythms. We also showed that in the Genetic Absence Epi - lepsy Rat from Strasbourg, a well-established rodent model of generalized epilepsy, the mechanisms un - derlying the termination of synchronized rhythms is disturbed. In thalamocortical cells of these animals, the regulation of pacemaker channels by cAMP is weakened, due to an enhanced expression of the mRNA for the cAMP-sensitive pacemaker channel subunits (manuscript submitted). Recently, we identified a novel mechanism by which the timing of neuronal oscillations is controlled. Nu - cleus reticularis thalamic cells are key players in the initiation of spindle oscillations and spontaneously generate vigorous, but strongly dampened rhythmic discharges. These are generated by the interplay Anita L\u00fcthi 67 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Neurobiology between low-threshold Ca2+ channels and Ca2+-de- pendent SK potassium channels. We identified a crucial role for the sequestration of intracellular Ca2+ by the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) in the timing of these neuronal oscillations ( Figure 2 ). The ER seems to compete with the SK channels for the Ca2+ ions, thereby promoting the dampening of the oscil - lations. We also demonstrated that this competition is based on a selectivity of intracellular Ca2+ seques - tration, perhaps due to subcellular colocalization of ER compartments with the low-threshold Ca2+ and the SK channels. 3. Synaptic control of higher-order thalamic nu - clei (S. Fr\u00e8re, M. Kuisle, N. Wanaverbecq) The thalamus acts as a relay for sensory input to the cortex, but is also implicated in the coordination of multisensory and sensorimotor information. This latter function arises within the neuroanatomical and -physiological innervation pattern of higher-or - der, as opposed to first-order, thalamic nuclei. We have characterized a novel inhibitory afferent sys - tem into higher-order thalamic nuclei, which is part of a family of inhibitory projections arising in sub - cortical sensorimotor control nuclei, including basal ganglia (Bokor et al., 2005). These projections have an unusually large size of their synaptic terminals (up to 10 micrometer in diameter) and possess up to ~20 synaptic release sites. Therefore, they are expected to show a high efficacy of inhibitory trans - mission and to play a permissive role in the gating of sensorimotor information. We are currently studying their release properties and their impact on thalamic burst discharge by using brain slices labelled in vi- tro or mice with genetically encoded fluorescence in inhibitory neurons. Furthermore, to compare and contrast the properties of first-order and higher-or - der thalamic nuclei, we are currently studying the re - sponse properties of first- and higher-order thalamic neurons to noradrenaline.Anita L\u00fcthi Publications Fr\u00e8re, S.G.A. & L\u00fcthi, A.

The functional units in these networks are synapses. To warrant efficient informa - tion transfer, synapses are highly specialized both on the pre- and on the postsynaptic side. It is evident that cellular differentiation, including the formation and remodeling of synaptic connections, depends on complex intracellular signaling networks that are activated by extracellular signaling molecules. Acti - vation of such signaling pathways ultimately leads to stable changes in the gene expression program that determines the state of differentiation of a cell. The long-term goal of our research is to identify and characterize molecules that affect the formation and the modulation of synaptic connections both during development and the process of learning and mem - ory. Because of mainly technical limitations, it has so far been difficult to study synaptogenesis on a molecu - lar level in the brain. In contrast, the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is easily accessible for experimental manipulations and is thus the best studied synapse in the vertebrate nervous system. Both, the basic prin - ciple of chemical synaptic transmission (e.g. quantal release of neurotransmitter) and the molecular basis of synapse formation have been discovered using the NMJ. Improper function of the NMJ is the cause of many diseases that are often severe and eventu - ally lead to premature death. They affect the pre- or the postsynaptic side and can have a genetic basis or might occur sporadically. This close relation be - tween basic mechanisms involved in NMJ formation and disease has triggered also our interest in exam - ining the molecular basis for the control of muscle function in normal and diseased state. This topic has become the second focus of our work. Molecular mechanisms of NMJ development During embryonic development, muscle fibers are formed by the fusion of precursor myoblasts. It was observed more than two decades ago and has more recently been studied in greater detail, that acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) form clusters be - fore motor neurons innervate muscle.

Agrin-MuSK signaling is also responsible to maintain gene transcription of postsynaptic genes in synaptic myonuclei. To elucidate the signaling pathways activated dur - ing the formation of postsynaptic structures, we conducted a gene expression profiling screen using rat soleus muscle injected with recombinant neural agrin. Seven days after injection, when many post - synaptic structures are formed, we isolated mRNA from such muscles and compared their gene expres - sion profile with muscles injected either with saline buffer or a splice version of agrin that cannot induce postsynaptic differentiation. Detailed analysis of the gene profiles revealed a set of immediate-early genes including Egr1 (Fig. 1A) that are known to be regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Indeed, we find that phosphorylat - ed forms of both the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun-N-terminal by agrin. strongly - cate that MAPK signaling contributes to the forma - tion and maintenance of postsynaptic structures in muscle. Interestingly, the MAPK pathway has also been implicated in changes of synaptic connections in response to learning and memory in the brain. Copines are a new family of molecules involved in the formation and restructuring of synapses in the central nervous system Another family of genes, that was discovered in the gene expression screen described above, are the copines. The copines are characterized by calcium- binding domains and their capability to form homo- and hetero-multimers. In mammals, eight copines have been annotated of which three are enriched in the central nervous system. Expression of some of the copines is also regulated during synapse for - mation in cultured hippocampal neurons. Functional studies using a combination of RNAi and overex - pression show that a knock-down of copine 3 caus - es a reduction in the length and density of spines. Over time, the dendritic tree collapses and neurons die due to apoptosis. In contrast, a knock-down of copine 6 increases spine density and spine-head - diameter (Fig. 1B). Finally, neurons in which both copine 3 and copine 6 were down-regulated by RNAi do not die (as is the case in copine 3 knock-down experiments) but show the same effect as a knock- down of copine 6 (increase in spine density). Moreo -ver, we find that copine 3 and copine 6 bind to each other and that copine 3 acts as a kinase. Since the binding of copine 3 to copine 6 is calcium- dependent and since it is known that calcium influx is a primary signal in the strengthening and restruc - turing of synapses in long-term potentiation, translo of copines into spines in response to depolari - zation was determined in collaboration with Thomas Oertner (Friedrich Miescher Institute, Basel). Copine 6 is enriched in spines and it becomes even more enriched in spines that are newly formed after depo - larization of the neurons. All together, these experi - ments are strong evidence for copines representing a new family of calcium-sensitive proteins that play a role in the formation of spines during development and their restructuring in the adult triggered by elec - trical activity (e.g. learning and memory processes). This work thus provides strong experimental evi - dence for the idea that genes that are regulated dur -Markus A.

Development of therapies for muscular dystro - phies We have recently shown in mice that a miniaturized form of the non-AChR-aggregating splice version of agrin, called \"mini-agrin\", can greatly ameliorate a muscular dystrophy that is caused by mutations in the extracellular matrix molecule laminin-2. The hu - man disease, called MDC1A, is the most frequent congenital muscular dystrophy (incidence rate of ap - proximately 0.5 x 10-5) and often leads to death in early childhood. Today, no treatment is available for this disease. By generating mice that allow tempo - ral control of \"mini-agrin\" expression, we now tested whether even late onset of expression ameliorates the disease and whether full-length agrin or another artificially designed, extracellular matrix molecule would influence disease progression. In all these cases, we find a clear amelioration of behavioral, histological and biochemical parameters. For exam - ple, muscles of 4 week-old mice that express \"mini- agrin\" look as healthy as muscle from wild-type mice (Fig. 2). The role of interactors of mTOR in brain and muscle Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), originally identified in yeast by Michael Hall and collaborators (Biozentrum), is a central controller of cell growth. In collaboration with his laboratory, we have shown that mTOR, unlike previously assumed, assembles into two distinct protein complexes, called mTOR com - plex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), that can be distinguished based on their sensitivity to rapamycin mTORC1 (rapamycin-sensitive) consists mTORC1 appears to be respon - sible for aspects involving cell growth by controlling protein translation, while mTORC2 affects the actin cytoskeleton. Tissues where growth and not cell division is the main mechanism that accounts for the size of an organ, are the brain and muscle. In both of these organs, the main constituents (i.e. neurons in the brain and muscle fibers in muscle) are postmitotic, yet the cells must adapt to external stimuli by chang - ing their size. In the developing brain, postmitotic neurons become highly polarized due to axonal and dendritic elongation. In the adult brain, growth and Markus A. R\u00fcegg the formation of new synapses are adaptations to external stimuli underlying learning and memory. In adult muscle, exercise causes hypertrophy, while in - activity, due to disease or as a natural consequence of ageing, causes atrophy. Several lines of evidence strongly suggest that mTOR-signaling participates in the control of these processes. We are in the proc - ess of generating mice where raptor (mTORC1) or rictor (mTORC2) can selectively be inactivated in either muscle or the brain (conditional knock-out mice) and we will analyze the consequence of these knockouts in both tissues. Figure 2: Histology of cross-sections from muscles iso - lated from mice with different genotypes. Muscles from wild-type (wt) mice are healthy, polygonally shaped. Mus - cle fibers from laminin-2-deficient mice (MDC1A) are ir - regularly shaped and many non-muscle cells infiltrate the tissue. In contrast, muscle from laminin-2-deficient mice that express \"mini-agrin\" (MDC1A & mag) looks similarly healthy as wild-type muscle.

Their aim is to build a global perspective of biological systems, from which one can infer novel organizational and functional prin - ciples. Some of the more specific issues addressed are interpretation of gene and genome structure, identification of sequence elements and pathways, regulation of gene expression, prediction and visu - alization of 3D structures, and classification of func - tional domains in protein sequences. The projects in the interdisciplinary Core Program \"Genome Scale Biology and Bioinformatics\" are spanning this wide range of biological questions, often in collaboration with experimental groups. The Core Program con - sists of six groups headed by Mihaela Zavolan (RNA Regulatory Networks), Erik van Nimwegen (Ge - nome Systems Biology), Torsten Schwede (Protein Microarray Urs Meyer (Pharmaco - genomics), and Peter Philippsen (Evolution of Cel - lular Networks) who is also associated with the focal area \"Cell growth and development\". The four Bioin - formatics groups are members of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB). The research activities of the individual groups are described below. Highlights The group of Erik van Nimwegen has developed an algorithm for Reconstructing regulatory networks computationally by comparing genomes, which out - performs other existing methods on both synthetic data and real data from Saccharomyces genomes (PLoS Computational Biology, Volume 1, Issue7, December 2005). The lab of Michael Primig has published an innova - tive tool for microarray data analysis and interpre - tation (Wrobel et al., Bioinformatics 2005) and par - ticipated in a study that identified a new surveillance mechanism of microtubule integrity during yeast meiosis (Hochwagen et al., Mol Cell Biol 2005). The group of P.

Education The members of the Core Program \"Genome Scale Biology and Bioinformatics\" organize the graduate teaching program on \"Genomics & Bioinformatics \" (Cycle F). The lecture series \"Introduction to Bioin - formatics I & II\" accompanied by practical exercises is taught during the Winter and Summer Semester respectively, and is followed by students from the Biozentrum graduate program, as well as students in NanoSciences and Computer Science. In the win - ter semester 2005/2006 the first advanced lecture, \"F10: Data Acquisition and Knowledge Representa - tion\", was introduced, and this will be followed by \"F7: Protein Structure Bioinformatics\" in summer se - mester 2006. Members of the Focal Area also con - tributed to the teaching of the Biozentrum curriculum lecture \"Biologie 4\", the Biochemistry block course, and several EMBnet training courses. In collabora - tion with the Swiss EMBnet node, Lorenza Bordoli provides user support and practical training courses in Bioinformatics. Overview and Infrastructure The Biozentrum's efforts to build a Bioinformatics di - vision were supported by the Swiss Institute of Bio - informatics (SIB), Novartis and Roche. During the years 2004 and 2005, especially the younger groups in Bioinformatics have been able to increase in size by hiring PhD students, PostDocs and research programmers on endowment positions as well as through successful grant applications at the Swiss National Science Foundation SNF. We have estab - lished a fruitful collaboration between the Biozen - trum, the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), and the Friedrich Miescher Institute (FMI) named Basel Computational Biology Center [BC]2 to provide com - petitive IT infrastructure including application-, data - base-, and web-servers as well as large scale stor - age and backup facilities. Conferences The Basel Computational Biology Conference [BC]2 is an annual interdisciplinary symposium organized at the Biozentrum to provide a platform for exchange of ideas in the field of computational biology. The symposium in 2004 \"From Information to Simula - tion\" has attracted more than 200 registered scien - tists from academic research institutes, the pharma - ceutical industry and Biotech companies. The third symposium in 2005 \"Biological Systems in silico\", inspired by the exciting developments around Sys - tems Biology in Basel, has continued the success of recent years. The theme of the fourth [BC]2 confer - ence in March 2006 will be centered around com - parative genomics. Core Program Genome Scale Biology and Bioinformatics74 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Genome Scale Biology & Bioinformatics Genetic and environmental factors cause clinically important interindividual differences in the response to drugs and chemicals. Genetic polymorphisms of the genes coding for drug metabolizing enzymes, receptors and transporters are major contributors to this variability. A second major source of variability is the effect of drugs on gene expression, i.e. the transcriptional activation or repression of genes coding for drug-metabolizing enzymes, such as cytochromes P450, a phenomenon known as \"in - duction\". The goal of our research is to understand the molecular mechanisms of variability in human drug response and to develop simple, non-invasive methods by which individuals at risk of developing adverse drug reactions, of suffering from drug inef - ficacy or drug-induced disease can be recognized. Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics Genetic polymorphisms of drug response are rela - tively common (>1%) monogenic traits caused by the presence of mutant alleles at the same gene lo - cus and more than one phenotype in regard to drug interaction with the organism. Pharmacogenetic polymorphisms lead to subgroups in the population with altered responses to drugs and chemicals, e.g. a higher incidence of adverse drug reactions or a higher risk to develop a certain disease, for example cancer. In the past, we have elucidated the molecu - lar mechanisms of several common genetic polymor - phisms of drug metabolizing enzymes. For review, see Nature Rev./Genetics 5, 669-676, 2004. More recently, we have collaborated with other laborato - ries to study the variation of cytochrome P4502A6 (CYP2D6), the enzyme catalyzing the metabolism of nicotine. DNA tests derived from these projects are now being used in epidemiological studies through - out the world, particularly to evaluate hypotheses that implicate these polymorphisms in adverse drug reactions or in the pathogenesis of several diseases including cancer. Mechanisms of Transcriptional Regulation of Cy - tochromes P450 (CYP) Genes by Drugs A second major source of variability in drug response is the effect of drugs on gene expression, i.e. the transcriptional activation or repression of genes cod - ing for drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug trans - porters. The present goal of our research team is to understand the molecular details of induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters. The following concept has emerged from studies in this and other laboratories. Inducers interact with the orphan nuclear receptors CAR (constitutive active or Molecular mechanisms of diversity in response to drugs and chemicals in man Urs A.

Eichelbaum (Stuttgart, Biology & Bioinformatics androstane receptor) or PXR (pregnane X receptor). These transcription factors form heterodimers with RXR (retinoid X receptor) and bind to enhancer mo - tifs in the flanking regions of drug-regulated genes. We have identified enhancer motifs in several drug- induced genes enzyme in heme biosynthesis. Moreover we have discovered a new xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptor, named CXR (chicken xenobiotic-sensing receptor) and have demonstrated important links between cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis and drug metabolism. We have also developed a non-mammalian system, namely avian liver, avian hepatocytes and avian hepatoma cells (LMH), to study induction of cyto - chromes P450 and heme synthesis by drugs and chemicals. In cells cytochromes P450 remain highly inducible by phenobarbital-like inducers in contrast to mammalian cell lines. Our experiments in LMH cells provide strong evidence for evolutionary conservation of the signaling pathways triggered by PXR, CAR and CXR. Thus, the phenobarbital-respon sive enhancer (PBRUs) of mouse Cyp2b10, rat CYP2B2 and human CYP2B6 were activated by the same compounds that activate the chicken CYP2H1 PBRU. Moreover, the mammalian receptors also bind to and activate the avian enhancer sequence. We could thus demonstrate that closely related nu - clear receptors, transcription factors and signaling pathways are mediating the transcriptional activation of multiple genes by xenobiotics in chicken, rodents and man (Handschin et al., 2002, 2005). However, the reasons for the lack of drug induction in mam - malian cell-lines remains obscure. One of our goals is to develop cell lines derived from human hepato - cytes and hepatoma cells that maintain the response to phenobarbital. How do drugs activate PXR and CAR? There are major open questions regarding the mechanism by which drugs activate gene transcrip - tion. PXR and CAR both are mediators of the cellu - lar response to xenobiotics, but their mechanisms of activation are different (Handschin & Meyer, 2003). PXR is apparently directly activated by xenobiotics that bind to its ligand-binding domain. CAR is unu - sual among the nuclear receptors in that it has high constitutive activity and is predominantly located in the cytoplasm. Treatment with phenobarbital, the classical inducer of drug metabolism, results in the translocation into the nucleus, where CAR (as het - erodimer with RXR) transactivates the - chromes and other genes. The mechanisms by which phenobarbital-type inducers lead to the translocation of CAR are not known, nor are those by which CAR transactivates the PBRUs. Franck Rencurel in our team has discovered that the energy sensor AMPK (AMP activated kinase) is necessary for phenobarbital-type induction in a human hepato - ma-derived cell line (Rencurel et al., 2005). He now has reproduced and extended these findings in hu - man hepatocytes in primary culture. Sharon Bl\u00e4ttler has reproduced these findings in LMH cells, provid - ing evidence for an evolutionary conservation of this mechanism. In both human and chicken hepato - cytes, phenobarbital increases the activity of AMPK, but the mechanism of this activation remains to be investigated. Apparently, it is not ATP depletion and we are presently testing a number of other hypoth - eses. Moreover, the target proteins of AMPK have been poorly studied in liver cells. The ultimate goal of all these studies, of course, is to understand the adaptation of the defense system against xenobiot - ics and to use this information in clinical therapy. Crosstalk between xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptors and receptors involved in cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis We have extended our studies on the crosstalk be - tween the nuclear receptors involved in cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis, namely LXR (the oxys - terol receptor) and FXR (the bile acid receptor) and the xenosensing nuclear receptors PXR, CAR and CXR (Gnerre at al., 2005; Handschin et al., 2005) LXR, activated by oxysterols, inhibits the effects of inducer drugs by binding to the drug-response ele - ments of several cytochromes P450. We have con - firmed this mechanism by collaborative experiments in LXR-/-, LXR-/- and LXR double knockout mice. However, these in vivo experiments also have revealed unexpected and complex effects of LXR on other systems. More recently, by feeding mice a 1 % cholesterol diet, Adrian Roth has discovered that the target gene of LXR, Srebp1, directly interferes with coactivator recruitment by PXR and CAR and can explain the repression of xenobiotic metabolism by cholesterol (Roth et al., submitted). These data may explain clinical observations in rodents with dis - turbed lipid metabolism (e.g. the Fa/Fa Zucker rat) and in obesity in man. At another level of regulation, Diana Jung has es - tablished that the bile acid receptor FXR regulates PXR expression by several FXR recognition sites in the promoter of PXR. This represents an additional Urs A. Meyer76 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Genome Scale Biology & Bioinformatics mechanism for the elimination of high levels of bile acids and drugs (Jung et al., submitted). In an ad - ditional study Carmela Gnerre has discovered that bile acids at physiological concentrations affect the expression of CYP3A4 via a previously unknown re - sponse element for FXR. This may be relevant for the clinically important, extremely variable expres - sion of CYP3A4. Taken together, these recent ex - periments reveal an interesting coevolution of de - toxication mechanism in the liver for drugs and bile acids (Gnerre et al. , 2004). Role of quires a coordinated increase in heme synthesis. We have characterized several drug-responsive en - hancer elements in the flanking region of the chicken, mouse and human 5-aminolevulinate synthase gene (ALAS1), the rate-limiting enzyme of heme synthe - sis. The chicken, mouse and human enhancers have been published (Fraser et al., 2002; 2003, Podvinec et al. , 2004). In an extension of these investiga - tions, we have studied the effect of fasting on the regulation of ALAS1 in collaboration with Christoph Handschin, now in the laboratory of Bruce Spiegel - mann (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medi - cal School, Boston, USA). We have discovered that ALAS1 is regulated by the peroxisome proliferators- activated receptor -coactivator 1 (PGC-1; Hand - schin et al. , 2005, editorial in Cell, commentary in Nature Medicine). These findings now allow us to restudy the mechanism of increase in heme synthe - sis during the induction of cytochromes P450 and to search for additional elements that respond to other inducer classes, a project carried out by Anne- Kathrin Peyer. By analyzing ultraconserved DNA se - quences in the 5'flanking region of chicken, mouse and human ALAS1, a number of recognition sites for the transcription factor Hepatic Nuclear Factor 4 (HNF4) and for FXR were discovered. These sites are presently studied by mutagenesis, chromatin im - munoprecipitation and in vivo studies with mice with liver-specific knockouts of HNF4 (collaboration with Frank Gonzalez, NCI, NIH) and in FXR-/- mice.

Meyer78 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Genome Scale Biology & Bioinformatics Meiosis leads to the formation of haploid gametes in nearly all sexually reproducing eukaryotes. This process promotes genetic diversity and is essential for the maintenance of the proper number of chro - mosomes during gametogenesis and subsequent fertilization. Progression through meiosis in yeast and mammals is regulated in part at the transcrip - tional level and often depends upon gene products specifically expressed during this important process. DNA microarray expression profiling studies identi - fied hundreds of loci transcribed in sporulating yeast and in meiotic and post-meiotic germ cells of several higher organisms, including flies, worms, and ro - dents. While a few key regulators are known to me - diate meiotic transcription in yeast, a full understand - ing of factors controlling this process is still lacking. Little is known about the regulation of meiotic tran - scription in other model systems or in humans. While high-throughput approaches yielded major insight into transcriptional co-regulation of functions in cell cycle progression and gametogenesis, they produce a huge amount of information that is impos - sible for most life scientists and medical researchers to fully exploit without access to adequate bioinfor - matics tools. Development of user-friendly biological data storage and analysis solutions require stan - dardized protocols and use of controlled vocabulary (ontology) that have begun to emerge only recently. The yeast meiotic expression program Dissecting the yeast meiotic transcriptional control network. In diploid yeast, nutritional and genetic cues trigger meiotic development yielding four hap - loid spores packaged in an ascus. The process de - pends upon two critical mitotic repressors of meiotic genes (Ume6 Sum1), a general (Abf1) and a meiosis-specific activator of middle and mid- late genes (Ndt80) all of which interact with specific target sites present in promoters that are induced during sporulation. Meiosis also depends on Ime1, a protein thought to control early meiotic gene activa - tion via complex formation with Ume6. Significant - ly, the promoters of many meiotically up-regulated genes lack any of the known motifs for Ume6, Abf1 or Ndt80, implying that these loci are regulated by as yet unidentified factors (Schlecht and Primig, 2003). In a study with A. Amon (MIT, Boston), we investi - gated effects on meiotic transcription caused by spindle destabilization and meiotic arrest resulting from benomyl or low temperature (10\u00b0C) treatment.

Complementing this work on the regulation of meiotic transcription, we are also continuing our long-standing studies of the role of Abf1 in mitosis and meiosis (Prinz et al. , 1995). Abf1 (ARS binding factor 1) was originally isolated as a protein essential for DNA replication and later shown to participate in gene silencing, nucleotide excision repair, mRNA export and gene expression. The pro - tein is thought to alter the chromatin structure of its target promoters rendering them accessible to oth - er activators. However, the precise roles of Abf1 in transcriptional control of growth and development are still poorly understood. To learn more about Abf1 dependent gene regulation, we are carrying out an approach that includes expression profiling, a ge - nome-wide protein-DNA interaction assay, binding site prediction and incorporation of protein-protein in - teraction data into the array data analysis procedure. We have identified many novel mitotic and meiotic Abf1 target loci mitotic and meiotic cell cycle progression, and spore development. Importantly, the upstream regions of genes down-regulated in the absence of functional Abf1 contain in most cases predicted Abf1 UAS target sites and the promoters are indeed of - ten bound by the protein in vivo as assessed by ge - nome-wide DNA binding assays (ChIP-Chip). More - over, we find that Abf1 appears to regulate biological functions also via transcriptional control of proteins that physically interact with a large number of other factors (Schlecht et al., manuscript in preparation). The core meiotic transcriptome in mammals We recently reported (with B. J\u00e9gou, University of Rennes) the first large-scale expression profiling analysis of rat spermatogenesis (Schlecht et al. , Mol Biol Cell 2004). We next carried out a cross-species analysis of male germline transcription by analyz - ing GeneChip expression data from mouse and rat showing that data obtained in different labs using whole-organ and purified cell samples from rodents yield highly reproducible results (Wrobel and Primig, 2005). Based on this result we set out to identify the core protein-coding expression program of the mammalian male germline. We have now analysed purified germ cell samples and total testes controls from human, mouse and rat with whole-genome GeneChips in collaboration with B. J\u00e9gou (Univer - sity of Rennes I) and D. Wolgemuth (Columbia Uni - versity, New York). Hundreds of conserved genes showing highly reproducible transcriptional profiles across all three species were classified into somatic and germline expression clusters. The latter group contained known loci involved in meiosis, cell cycle progression, spermatogenesis or reproduction and many genes of unknown biological function. For these human loci, novel roles in male meiosis, ga - metogenesis and fertility are predicted by our data. These results will accelerate efforts to identify genes important for gametogenesis and they are likely to yield markers useful for the classification of repro - ductive pathologies related to meiotic failure (Rol - land et al. , manuscript in preparation). Microarray data management and analysis Gene expression profiling is the most common ap - plication of microarrays and providing data via certi - fied global repositories has now become mandatory for publishing in most scientific journals. To facili - tate local array data management several solutions have been developed, but they cover different array platforms and often come with unintuitive graphical user interfaces. The key issue is that array data an - notation (description) is a tedious process and no standardized ontology (controlled vocabulary) is yet available. Moreover, there is no integrated software suite that includes convenient functionalities specifi - cally for GeneChip data storage and uploading to a certified repository as well as data analysis and interpretation. To address these important issues, we have developed the Microarray Information Man - agement and Annotation System (MIMAS). The da - tabase is accessible at http://www.mimas.unibas.ch/ (Hermida et al., in press). Long-term maintenance of the project is ensured via a collaboration with V. Jongeneel (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics; Vital-IT, http://www.vital-it.ch/, Lausanne). MIMAS is being integrated with the certified public repository at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and with novel data mining tools such as Go - Cluster. The program was developed in our labora - tory and reveals statistically significant enrichment of GeneOntology terms within groups of co-expressed genes obtained with a variety of clustering algorithms (Wrobel et al. , 2005). A proto-type tool for community genome annota - tion Classical approaches to knowledgebase develop - ment are based on the work of small groups of cu - rators who process a rapidly increasing amount of information from the scientific literature. The large volume of data combined with the complexity of biological results means that some of the database Michael Primig80 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Genome Scale Biology & Bioinformatics entries are incomplete, obsolete, and, on occasion, wrong. An important aim in the field of genome anno - tation is therefore to solicit contributions from life sci - entists who are asked to help keep entries complete and accurate. However, the established databases lack the appropriate submission/curation interface necessary for community annotation. With GermOn - line we have developed the first such tool and we are carrying out a coordinated programme of large-scale cross-species community annotation organised ac - cording to research fields. In addition to providing a unique platform for biomedical research in germline development, GermOnline serves as a paradigm for knowledgebase development in other fields. A pro - totype server network is accessible via http://www. germonline.org/ (Primig et 2003; Wiederkehr et al., 2004a; Wiederkehr et al., 2004b). In the future, we intend to integrate more array data and to expand the array platform types to include til - ing arrays. Furthermore, once the necessary critical mass of core staff is obtained, we shall focus on gene annotation and information build-up with emphasis on cross-species description of conserved genes es - sential for the meiotic process. The data stored in GermOnline will be made available for downloading and computational analysis via the Internet.Michael Primig Publications Hermida L, Demougin P, Descombes Primig M (2006).

Our current projects focus on three main areas: Expert systems for comparative protein struc - ture modelling Three-dimensional protein structures are of great in - terest for the rational design of many different types of biological experiments, such as site-directed mu - tagenesis or structure-based discovery of specific inhibitors. However, the number of structurally char - acterized proteins is small compared to the number of known protein sequences; as of November 2005, more than 33'000 experimentally determined protein structures were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), while the UniProt protein knowledge database held more than 2 million sequences. Various com - putational methods for modelling three-dimensional structures of proteins have been developed to over - come this limitation. Since the number of possible folds in nature appears to be limited and the three- dimensional structure of proteins is better conserved than their sequences, it is often possible to identify a homologous protein with a known structure (tem - plate) for a given protein sequence (target). In these cases, homology modelling has proven to be the method of choice to generate a reliable three-dimen - sional model of a protein, as impressively shown in several meetings of the bi-annual CASP experiment. The huge amount of data originating from genome sequencing projects and structural genomics stud - ies motivated the development of expert systems and fully automated methods which are sufficiently fast and reliable to generate accurate models on the scale of whole genomes. The SWISS-MODEL server pioneered automated web-based comparative modelling. My group is de - veloping and operating the SWISS-MODEL server as part of our activities within the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. Over the last 12 months, our server has treated more than 130'000 requests for individ - ual 3-dimensional protein models. We have created the SWISS-MODEL Repository, a relational data - base of annotated protein models, which has been well accepted as a resource for model information. The aim of the SWISS-MODEL Repository is to pro - vide access to an up-to-date collection of annotated three-dimensional protein models generated by au - tomated homology modelling, narrowing the gap be - tween sequence and structure databases.

In November 2005, after two years of development, we have released the next server generation, the SWISS-MODEL Workspace. It integrates programs and a web-based modelling envi - ronment, allowing the user to construct comparative protein models from a computer with web connec - tion without the need for downloading and installing large program packages and databases. Comparative modelling and structural genomics are complementing each other in the exploration of the protein structure space. In a comparative genom - ics analysis (collaboration with B. Erni, University of Bern), we are currently exploring the differences in the proteome between four bacterial species, Esch , aiming to identify interesting target proteins for molecular characterization and experimental structure determi - nation. Comparative modelling applications in experi - ment design and drug discovery Comparative protein modelling can support a variety of applications in life science research, such as the design of site directed mutagenesis experiments, the rationalization of the effects of sequence variations, or virtual screening and structure based drug design. We are collaborating with experimentalist and com - putational groups on specific practical applications. Role of the plug domain of the Sec61p: Secretory and membrane proteins are sorted to the ER by signal sequences which upon insertion into the membrane are either cleaved or anchor the protein in the lipid bilayer. A conserved hetero-trimeric membrane pro - tein complex, the Sec61 or SecY complex, forms a protein-conducting channel, allowing polypeptides to be transferred across or integrated into membranes. We have built a hetero-trimeric model for the yeast Sec61 translocon complex based on the experimen - tal crystal structure of M. jannaschii SecY. In collab - oration with Martin Spiess (Biozentrum Basel) this model was used to design site-directed mutations in Sec61p to study their influence on topogenesis. A designed deletion of the plug domain resulted in vi - able cells without growth defect, but showing effects on topogenesis. Sequence variations and SNPs: Single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, account for the major part of inter-individual variation in the genome. The ef - fects of genetic variations range from neutral muta - tions, through increased susceptibility for complex diseases and individual variation in drug response, to rare single-allele mendelian inherited diseases. Non-synonymous mutations located in protein coding regions, i.e. variations leading to an exchange of an amino acid, may possibly affect a protein's stability or function. Since protein function strongly depends on the integrity of its three-dimensional structure, structural models of proteins can be used to analyze the functional role of the mutated residue and to pro - vide insights into possible molecular consequences of mutations. We are currently performing a system - atic analysis of pairs of protein structures with single point mutations to provide the basis for the develop - ment of suitable approaches for comparative model - ling of SNPs. Engineering of ATP-binding sites on protein kinases: Sequences of protein kinases are easily recognized by characteristic sequence motifs or homology with other kinases. Unfortunately, there is no comparable straight-forward approach to recognize the specific target of a protein kinase. The group of Kevan Sho - kat has introduced an elegant method to use protein design to engineer a functionally silent yet structur - ally significant mutation into the ATP binding site of the protein kinase. If this mutation is well designed, the protein functions similar to the wild-type enzyme with regard to the natural ATP substrate. However, due to the modified binding site, it may also accept Torsten Schwede Figure 1: Comparative protein structure model of the yeast Sec61 hetero-trimer based on the archaeal SecY crystal structure from Methanococcus jannaschii. Residues form - ing the plug-domain are highlighted.83 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Genome Scale Biology & Bioinformatics chemically modified ATP radio-labelled derivatives, which act as non-specific inhibitors of the wild-type enzyme. We have used homology modelling to build a three-dimensional model for the protein kinase ATP binding pocket of human LKB1 based on the structure of murine cAMP dependent protein kinase and designed Shokat-type mutations (in collabora - tion with S. Antonarakis, University of Geneva). First analysis of the expressed protein show significant in vitro kinase activity for both ATP and the chemically N6-modified ATP analogue. Similar approaches in collaboration with other experimentalist groups (U. Meyer, Biozentrum, Basel; B. Hemmings, FMI, Ba - sel) are currently in progress at different experimen - tal stages. Molecular modelling of protein-ligand complexes: Structure-based methods for drug discovery have made significant impact on the development of drugs in recent years. Several compounds discovered with the help of structural information have successfully passed clinical trials and have become approved drugs. One of the bottlenecks of structure-based methods is the availability of experimental structures of the target proteins. In these cases, protein struc - ture homology models can provide a valuable alter - native. The main concern of this approach is how errors and inaccuracies of the homology models in - fluence the molecular modelling of the protein-ligand interaction. We have initiated a project (in collabora - tion with M. Meuwly, University Basel, and V. Zoete, SIB Lausanne) to explore the extent to which ho - mology models can be used to study protein-ligand interactions. We have established a computational method for estimating the relative binding free en - ergy of ligands in a model system (HIV-I protease) using restraint molecular dynamics methods (MD- GBSA) which correlates well with experimental data. By systematically introducing typical errors in the protein structure before simulation, we can explore the influence of inaccuracies of homology models on molecular modelling. GRID computing as a platform for applied re - search in bioinformatics Many approaches in computational biology are cur - rently limited by the available computational resourc - es. However, the combined theoretical computation power of Swiss scientific institutions is orders of mag - nitude larger than that available at each individual in - stitution. We have developed a computational GRID infrastructure for bioinformatics applications which allows us to transparently compute embarrassing - ly' parallel work units in a heterogeneous hardware and OS environment. We entered collaboration with several Swiss scientific centres (FMI, CSCS, SIB/Vi - talIT, FGCZ, Novartis) to form the SwissBioGrid\" ini - tiative. The scientific application in our group which mainly benefits from this new infrastructure is virtual screening on Dengue viral target proteins. Dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are caused by one of four closely related, but antigenically distinct, virus serotypes. Dengue is primarily a disease of the tropics, and the viruses that cause it are maintained in a cycle that involves humans and Aedes aegypti, a domestic, day-biting mosquito that prefers to feed on humans. Infection with dengue viruses produces a spectrum of clinical illness ranging from a non-spe - cific viral syndrome to severe and fatal hemorrhagic disease. We have entered a collaborative project which is aimed at the computational screening of small compounds available in public compound li - braries to identify very early drug candidates, which could interact with molecular targets of the dengue viruses. We have selected the N-terminal domain of NS5 (RNA methyl transferase) as primary target, which is associated with the RNA capping reaction that puts a cap structure (7MeG5'-ppp5'-NMe) on the plus strand RNA genome and is crucial for the replicative cycle of the virus. Promising compounds arising from the virtual screening will be further an - alyzed in vitro by the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD, Singapore).Torsten Schwede Figure 2: Structure model of a HIV-I protease dimer in complex with an inhibitor surrounded by water molecules.

These regulatory systems have been designed by an evo - lutionary process that has taken billions of years and we currently understand very little about the way in which this evolutionary process has shaped the de - sign of these regulatory systems. The main research interest of our group is the study of genome-wide regulatory systems, to reconstruct them from high- throughput molecular data, to understand and model how they have evolved, and to search for design principles in their construction. The activities in our group revolve around the devel - opment and application of computational and ana - lytical tools to study regulatory networks and their evolution. These studies can be roughly separated into three components. First, we are developing new algorithmic tools for the automated reconstruction of genome-wide regulatory networks from comparative genomic, ChIP-on-chip, and gene expression data. Second, we are developing methods for studying genome evolution and the evolution of regulatory networks in particular. Finally, we are studying the properties of the inferred regulatory networks and build evolutionary models that can account for the observed characteristics. Genome-wide annotation of regulatory sites An important research topic in my group in the last years has been the development and application of tools for the automated genome-wide annotation of regulatory sites based on comparative genomic, gene expression array, and ChIP-on-chip data. Ex - isting motif finding methods either search for over - represented sequence motifs in a set of co-regulated sequences, or search for significantly conserved se - quence segments in multiple alignments of ortholo - gous intergenic regions. We have developed a novel algorithm, called PhyloGibbs, that combines these two approaches in a rigorous Bayesian frame work. The algorithm operates on collections of alignments of orthologous intergenic regions and searches through all possible ways in which an arbitrary num - ber of binding sites for an arbitrary number of regula - tors can be assigned to the alignments. A probability is assigned to each such binding site configuration using an explicit mathematical model for the evolu - tion of regulatory sites and nonfunctional DNA and taking into account the phylogenetic relationships of the species from which the sequences derive. Principles of regulatory design Erik van Nimwegen Phone +41 61 267 15 76 Fax +41 61 267 15 84 erik.vannimwegen@unibas.ch www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/nimwegen Group Members Lukas Burger Ionas Erb Jose Ignacio Molina Nicodeme Paul Mikhail Pachkov In Collaboration with Eric D. Siggia (the Rockefeller University, New York); Michael Lenardo Isabelle Steiger, Yvonne Steger Member of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics http://www.isb-sib.ch 86 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Genome Scale Biology & Bioinformatics We inferred the binding specificities for a large num - ber of transcription factors in Saccharomyces cere - visisia by applying PhyloGibbs to a large ChIP-on- chip dataset in combination with the genomes of 5 recently sequenced Saccharomyces species. By comparing our results with known regulatory sites from the literature we can show that by combining in - formation on evolutionary conservation with informa - tion on overrepresentation of sequence motifs, Phy - loGibbs produces significantly more accurate results than existing methods. Since the ChIP-on-chip data have a high rate of false negatives, many functional sites are missed in this initial annotation. To remedy this, we have also developed a novel iterative pro - cedure that takes the inferred motifs and scans the multiple alignments of all yeast intergenic regions for additional binding sites. Using this procedure we have produced a draft genome-wide annotation of regulatory sites in S. cerevisiae which contains over thirty thousand predicted binding sites for about 80 yeast transcription factors. In a collaboration with the group of Prof. Michael Primig we have been able to validate over 50% of the predicted binding sites for the factor ABF1 using independent ChIP-on-chip ex - periments. In addition, about 80% of the genes ex - perimentally shown to be regulated by ABF1 have predicted binding sites in their promoter region. We are now applying PhyloGibbs on a larger scale to produce genome-wide annotations of regulatory sites across many sequenced bacterial genomes. We have developed an automated procedure for identify - ing orthologous genes and producing syntenic align - ments of the genomes of related bacteria. The auto - mated procedure also reconstructs the phylogenetic tree relating the species and produces alignments of all orthologous intergenic regions between the spe - cies. We then run PhyloGibbs on these alignments to predict conserved binding sites genome-wide. We are validating our procedure using known sites in E. coli and B. subtilis . This procedure allows us to an - notate regulatory sites in a large number of bacterial species for which virtually nothing is currently known about transcription regulation. Finally, to disseminate our predictions to the scientif - ic community worldwide we have developed a web- based database and genome browser (http://www. swissregulon.unibas.ch) that contains all our anno - tations and that allows users to browse the predicted regulatory sites on the genome. Computational reconstruction of bacterial sig - naling networks Two-component systems are a large family of bac - terial proteins that are responsible for a significant portion of signal transduction in bacteria. Each two- component system consists of a pair of proteins, with one containing a histidine kinase domain and the other containing a receiver domain. Although many bacteria have tens of such two-component systems with structurally highly similar kinase and receiver domains, the phospho-transfer is almost always highly specific, with each kinase showing a strong preference for phosphorylating its cognate partner receiver. Our aim is to develop a computational model that is capable of predicting which kinase interacts with which receiver using only their amino acid sequenc - es. Two-component systems are a very attractive model system for such a program because of several unique features they possess. First, all kinases and receivers exhibit a high degree of sequence similari - ty and are believed to fold into the same or very simi - lar three dimensional structures. Second, thousands of two-component systems can be recognized in sequenced genomes, and their sequence similarity allows us to make accurate multiple alignments of all kinases and receivers. Finally, for a significant frac - tion of all two-component systems the cognate ki - nase/receiver pair is encoded by neighboring genes in a common operon on the genome. Using this large training set of cognate kinase/receiver pairs, we first identified pairs of positions in the proteins that show significant correlations in the amino ac - ids that occur at these positions. We then created a probabilistic model for the joint distribution of amino acids at all correlated positions that allows us to dis - tinguish interacting kinase/receiver pairs from non- interacting pairs. Preliminary results show that our model can accurately predict which pairs interact. In particular, our model allows us to predict interaction partners genome-wide for \"orphan\" kinases and re - ceivers that occur in operons by themselves. Finally, by predicting all interaction pairs genome-wide we have started to reconstruct genome-wide signaling networks in bacteria, and this allows us to study the structural properties of these signaling networks. Regulation and noise in alternative splicing In collaboration with the group of Prof. Mihaela Zavo - lan and the RIKEN institute in Japan we have been studying alternative splicing in the mouse genome. The first aim of this project was to get an accurate Erik van Nimwegen87 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Genome Scale Biology & Bioinformatics account of alternative splicing in mouse, to classify the types of alternative splice events, and to quantify the prevalence of different types of splice variation. After this we studied how and to what extent these splice variations are regulated versus just the result of noise in the splicing process, and we investigat - ed to what extent the splice variations appear to be functional. In order to identify splice variations we used genome alignments of the large FANTOM datasets of full- length cDNAs produced by the RIKEN institute. We found, however, that existing spliced alignment al - gorithms for mapping cDNAs to the genome did not reach the required level of accuracy for an accurate accounting of the splice variation evident in the data. In particular, existing algorithms often failed to map the starts and/or ends of the transcripts, and there were often inaccuracies in the placement of the splice boundaries. We therefore decided to develop a new alignment algorithm, called SPA for Spliced Alignment, which implements a Bayesian probabi - listic approach. The main novel feature of our algo - rithm is that it uses explicit probabilistic models of gene structures and sequencing errors. This allows us to correctly trade-off the likelihood of different gene structures against the likelihoods of different sequencing errors. In addition, our algorithm uses a more sophisticated model of splice boundaries that allows us to correctly identify non-canonical splice boundaries, and even novel types of non-canonical splice boundaries. Application of SPA to the RIKEN FANTOM3 set of over 100,000 full-length cDNAs shows that SPA significantly improves on existing methods, in particular in the mapping of the 5' and 3' ends of the transcripts. To study the contributions of noise and regulation in alternative splicing we have studied the two most common forms of splice variation; \"cassette exons\" that occur in some but not all transcripts, and small exon-length variations at acceptor and donor sites. Our studies show that the in- or exclusion of cassette exons is often dependent on the promoter that was used to initiate the transcript. This result suggests that exon inclusion might often be regulated at the transcriptional level. In addition, the data suggests that alternative exon inclusion events are highly bi - ased to avoid frame-shifts from occurring, with dif - ferent cassette exons of the same gene often show - ing correlated in- and exclusion so as to conserve the reading frame. This suggests that many of the cassette exon splice variations may be functional. In contrast, our analysis of the exon-length varia - tions at acceptor and donor sites strongly suggests that these common splice variations are the result of noise in the splicing process. In particular, using a large number of exon boundaries that do not show splice variation, we built weight matrix models of the sequence-specificity of the spliceosomes at acceptor and donor boundaries. Using these weight matrices, we showed that the observed exon-length variations can be accurately explained by a simple physical model in which the spliceosome binds stochastically to neighboring splice sites with similar affinity. Modeling the dynamics of cell-cultures In modeling the dynamics of even very simple bio - logical systems one is often faced with very incom - plete information about the underlying components, reactions, and their kinetic parameters. The chal - lenge in such situations is to still infer quantities of interest from this incomplete information. In collab - oration with Michael Lenardo at the NIH in Wash - ington DC, we developed a novel mathematical ap - proach to such problems in the context of inferring key parameters of cell-culture dynamics from a set of measurements. Lenardo's group has shown that the death of T-cells infected with HIV is not the result of apoptosis but rather necrosis, and that this cytopathicity is depen - dent on the expression of proteins from the HIV ge - nome. The aim of our collaboration was to estimate the cytopathicity of different HIV deletion strains in order to identify the HIV genes involved in T-cell kill - ing. We obtained time courses of infectivity (fraction of cells infected) and viability (fraction of life cells) in cultures of T-cells infected with different HIV strains. Our new approach was to fit these time courses to a set of coupled differential equations in which all complexities of the dynamics were subsumed into time-dependent 'effective rates'. Using these equa - tions we were able to derive time-dependent upper and lower bounds on the cytopathicity of the different strains. This in turn allowed us to determine that the VPR gene makes an important contribution to the cytopathicity of HIV.Erik van Nimwegen88 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Genome Scale Biology & Bioinformatics Publications Siddharthan, R., Siggia, E.D. & van Nimwegen, E.

Erik van Nimwegen89 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Genome Scale Biology & Bioinformatics Recent probing of mammalian gene expression us - ing high-throughput techniques revealed that much of the diversity of cell types in multi-cellular eukary - otes is due to the complex patterns of expression of gene structures. Most genes initiate transcription from multiple promoters, have complex patterns of splice variations and multiple poly-adenylation sites, and antisense transcription appears to be common. An entirely new form of gene expression regulation has been discovered and shown to involve small RNA molecules. The proportion of regulatory RNA genes in the human genome is now estimated to be at least a few percent of all genes in the genome, and their number is still growing. Computational meth - ods, some developed in my group, have been instru - mental in the identification and annotation of genes, splice variants and targets of regulatory RNAs. Regulated and stochastic expression of splice forms Since 60-70% of the human and mouse genes ap - pear to have multiple splice forms, understanding the regulation of alternative splicing is key to un - derstanding how mammalian cells differentiate and adapt to various environments. To take advantage of the vast amount of transcript data in the discov - ery of splice regulatory signals, we have developed an automated pipeline that maps EST and cDNA sequences to their genome with high accuracy and identifies alternative splice forms. The program for the cDNA-to-genome alignment was recently final - ized through a collaboration with the group of Erik van Nimwegen. As a first application, we have ana - lyzed the set of over 100,000 full-length mouse cD - NAs that has been released this year by the Riken Institute in Japan. We focused on the two most common forms of splice variation: cryptic exons (exons that are included in some transcripts and skipped in others) and small variations in exon length due to changes in the ac - ceptor splice site. Our first goal was to determine whether the inclusion/exclusion of internal exons depends on the promoter from which the transcript was initiated. We focused specifically on transcripts that have been initiated from promoters that were in - dependently validated using CAGE (cap analysis of gene expression) analysis, that was also performed by the Riken group. Our conclusion is that the inclu - sion of at least 5% of internal cryptic exons depends on the promoter from which the transcript was initi - ated. This is the first large scale computational study that provides statistical evidence for the coupling be - tween transcription and splicing.

These are adjacent splice acceptor sites that can both be used in splicing, causing 3-nucleotide variations be - tween the transcripts that harbor them. A few years ago, we described these variations as the most com - mon exon length variations in mouse, and more re - cent studies argued that they are subject to selection pressure and play an important role in fine-tuning the proteome. We built a model of the sequence speci - ficity of the factors that bind at the splice acceptor site, and we showed that NAGNAG sequences at which we observed splice variation can be distin - guished from those that do not by the likelihood of the two neighboring candidate splice sites. Further - more, analysis of the frequency of NAGNAG splice boundaries in protein coding and non-coding exons, as well as of the evolutionary conservation of the variant and invariant NAGNAG splice boundaries suggest that variant NAGNAG motifs are not under any specific selection pressure, but are most likely the results of neutral evolution. As shown in the figure above, most of the invariant exons that exhibit the NAGNAG sequence at the ac - ceptor site use the first NAG site as acceptor, and this site has indeed a much higher likelihood than the second site (green). In contrast, the likelihood of the two sites is very similar for the exons that undergo alternative splicing (red). Thus, it appears that splice variation at NAGNAG sites occurs whenever evolu - tion generates putative acceptors with comparable likelihoods, and at this point there is no evidence that a specific selection pressure operates to generate such sites. To continue our studies of the mechanism and implication of splice variation at NAGNAG sites, we have teamed up with the group of Stefan Stamm at the University of Erlangen, who will be testing our hypotheses using in vitro splicing assays and the group of Torsten Schwede at the Biozentrum, with whom we will be studying the impact of these single amino acid changes on protein function.Identification of regulatory RNAs and of their mRNA targets Small single-stranded RNAs exert a wide range or regulatory functions, from degradation and transla - tional silencing of target mRNA, to transcriptional silencing of transposable elements and chromatin remodeling. We have collaborated for a number of years with the group of Thomas Tuschl at the Rock - efeller University on projects aimed at discovering small regulatory RNAs. In the past year we have completed a study on virus-encoded miRNAs, we have characterized the miRNA profile of the zebraf - ish model organism, and we are in the process of releasing a large data set of over 400,000 small RNA sequences cloned from human, mouse and rat. This is the most comprehensive mammalian miRNA pro - filing study to date. We are continuing to develop methods for predict - ing miRNA genes in single genomes. While we have initially used this methods to identify viral miRNAs, we have started to focus on mammalian genomes, and we were able to identify over 60 novel miRNA lo - cated within 10 kilobases of known miRNAs. This, as well as other prediction studies that appeared in the past year, indicate that the number of miRNA genes is much larger than initially anticipated. The most important open question in the field of miRNA research is what mRNAs are being targeted by miRNAs. We have implemented and experiment - ed with various methods for miRNA target prediction, and we just finalized a target prediction algorithm that uses the number and evolutionary conservation of putative target sites in a probabilistic framework to make predictions about specific miRNA-mRNA inter - actions. Based on the results that we have already obtained, we find an association between strongly conserved putative miRNA binding sites and various known A/U-rich elements that are known to bind vari - ous proteins involved in modulating mRNA stability. We are now initiating collaborations with experimen - tal groups within the Biozentrum and the Friedrich Miescher Institute to test specific predictions of tar - get genes and the motifs involved in miRNA-depen - dent translational regulation.Mihaela Zavolan of exons91 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Genome Scale Biology & Bioinformatics Publications Sewer, A., Paul, N., Landgraf, P., Aravin, A., Pfeffer, S., Brownstein, M., Tuschl, T., van Nimwegen, E. & Zavolan, M.

Enormous advances have been made dur - ing the last decades in the techniques that visualize the three-dimensional structure and quantify the dynam - ics of cellular components down to the atomic level. It is the goal of the Core Program 'Structural Biology and Biophysics' to apply, and where possible, further develop these structural and biophysical techniques in order to understand at all levels the interactions that make up the dynamic network of a living system. It is our clear perspective that the understanding of biological function goes beyond a pure static, struc - tural description and that additional information is needed from other biophysical techniques. In all of the research areas, a very strong interplay exists between structure determination and biophysics that is being used for the characterization of the dynamics and stability of proteins and their interactions. The struc - tural techniques range from light, electron and scan - ning microscopy over X-ray crystallography to NMR spectroscopy. Biophysical methods encompass different techniques as laser-flash and stopped-flow optical spectrosco - pies, thermodynamic analytical methods such as ITC and DSC microcalorimetry, NMR imaging and in vivo spectroscopy. Using rigorous combinations of these techniques, we are in a unique position to determine the structure of biological matter at all length scales, from atomic detail over entire cells to small animals, to analyze and quantify dynamic changes starting from picosecond time scales to very long periods, and to determine the energetics and thermodynamics of bio - molecular interactions at very high precision. Strong synergisms exist with all other research ar - eas of the Biozentrum since many of the systems are shared projects with other biochemically or biologically oriented groups. Teaching Knowledge of structural principles of biomacromol - ecules and understanding and quantitative application of biophysical methods are prerequisites for success in all areas of biomolecular research. In addition to the specific research, the Core Program's teaching contributes fundamentally to the Biozentrum's Biology curriculum. Structural biology and biophysical theories together with the relevant techniques are being taught at various levels by all members of the Core Program. Core Program Structural Biology & Biophysics Professors Ueli Aebi, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Structural Biology & Biophysics Undergraduate lectures are in part also attended by students of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chemistry, Physics and Nano-Science.

Her research focuses on single molecule and time-resolved fluorescence measurements of the dynamics of molecular motors. In 2005 Drs. Birthe Fahrenkrog and Sergei Strelkov successfully passed their \"Habilitation\". At the end of 2005, Sergei Strelkov left the Biozentrum to accept an Associate Professorship at the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium. Heiko Heerklotz received the Stig Sunner Memorial Award for the year 2005 at the 59th Calorimetry Con - ference in Santa Fe, USA. Joachim Seelig received the Avanti Lipid Award for the year 2005 at the Annual Meeting of the Biophysical Society, USA. Stephan Grzesiek received the Laukien Prize for the year 2005 at the 46th Experimental Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Conference (ENC) in Providence, USA. The EMBO Practical Course 'Structure determination of biological macromolecules by solution NMR' was organized by Stephan Grzesiek from September 7 to 14, 2005 at the Biozentrum. Two group leaders (Ueli Aebi and Andreas Engel) are also project leaders in the National Centers of Compe - tence in Research \"Nanoscale Science\" (UA and AE). As of June 2005, the latter has been renewed and funded for another four years. External support by the M.E. M\u00fcller Foundation The core program receives generous support from the M.E. M\u00fcller Foundation via the fully integrated M.E. M\u00fcller Institute for Structural Biology (research groups Ueli Aebi and Andreas Engel). The M.E.

This ambitious goal is achieved by a structure-based experimental ap - proach which employs hybrid methods such as light, electron and scanning probe microscopies, X-ray crystallography, biophysics, biochemistry, and mo - lecular cell biology. Being problem-driven, the lab fo - cuses on (1) cytoskeleton structure, assembly, turn - over and mechanics; (2) the nuclear pore complex and nucleocytoplasmic transport; (3) oligomerization and polymerization of amyloid forming peptides and how these spatially and temporally correlate with disease progression; and (4) developing and imple - menting novel optical and mechanical nano-sensors and nano-actuators for local diagnosis and therapy by minimally invasive interventions. In addition to the research which is directed by U. Aebi, his lab hosts three groups headed by independent project leaders which have in part their own funding and collaborate on various projects with members of the Aebi group. PD Dr. Cora Sch\u00f6nenberger's main focus is on new forms and functions of actin in the nucleus, and on novel regulatory mechanisms con - trolling cardiac function; PD Dr. Birthe Fahrenkrog analyzes nuclear pore complex proteins in nucleo - cytoplasmic transport and other cellular processes, such as yeast apoptosis; and PD Dr. Sergei Strelkov employs X-ray crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to dissect the structural organiza - tion of intermediate filaments (IFs) at atomic detail to ultimately rationally understand IF-based human diseases. The progress of their projects is presented in independent reports. Following are a few selected results from the Aebi group. Assessing the mechanical behavior of single intermediate filaments by scanning force microscopy Despite their importance in determining cellular ar - chitecture and plasticity, few data are available on the mechanical properties of intermediate filaments (IFs) in vitro or within cells and tissues. In this context, Laurent Kreplak, a postdoc in the lab, has employed a scanning force microscopy (SFM) based protocol to directly probe the mechanical properties of single cytoplasmic IFs when adsorbed to a solid support in a physiological buffer environment. Depending on the experimental conditions chosen, the SFM tip was used to laterally displace or stretch single IFs on the support to which they had been adsorbed. Upon applying force, IFs were stretched on average 2.6 fold before breaking, with a maximum of 3.6 fold.

Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Structural Biology & Biophysics Concomitant with this stretching, a large reduction of the apparent filament diameter. Exhibiting such mechanical properties which are quite distinct from those revealed by actin filaments or microtubules, suggests that in vivo IFs may serve as 'mechanical shock absorbers' or a 'security belt' in tissues ex - posed to extreme mechanical stress. Tinkering with a cellular nanomachine - the nuclear pore complex Natively unfolded phenylalanine-glycine (FG)- repeat domains which are grafted to about 30% of the nucleoporins, are alleged to form the physical constituents of the selective gate in nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) during nucleocytoplasmic trans - port (NCT). To provide a more mechanistic insight into the barrier mechanism controlling NCT, Rod - erick Lim, a postdoc in the lab, has designed an experimental platform to study surface-tethered FG-repeat domains at the nanoscale which mimics the general physical dimensions of NPCs. Scan - ning force spectroscopy measurements indicate that the collective behavior of such FG-repeat domains gives rise to a long-range exponentially decaying re - pulsive force in physiological buffer. The measured forces are appropriately described by polymer scal - ing theory which suggests that the molecules are thermally mobile and exist in an extended polymer brush-like conformation. This assertion is strength - ened by observing that the brush-like conformation undergoes a reversible collapse transition in less po - lar solvent conditions. Taken together, these findings reveal how FG-repeat domains may simultaneously function as an entropic barrier and a selective trap in the near-field of native NPCs. Rod is now prob - ing these minimalist pores' with functionalized SFM tips, for example, with importin-beta, BSA, etc. As expected, importin-beta tips experience an attractive force, whereas BSA tips, i.e. representing a passive' cargo, feel a repulsive force. Ultimately, by combin - ing our minimalist pores' with a two-compartment system harboring RanGTP in one compartment and RanGDP in the other, these should achieve receptor- mediated vectorial transport of signal-bearing (NLS or NES) cargos and, at the same time, act as a bar - rier to passive' cargoes.

Protofibrils are up to ~600 nm in length and have mass-per-lengths (MPLs) of 19\u00b12 kDa/nm measured by scanning transmission electron mi - croscopy. Two predominant mature fibril types, sev - eral microns in length and with MPLs of 18\u00b13 and 27\u00b13 kDa/nm, are identified after longer incubation times. The difference of ~9 kDa/nm between the two fibril types indicates a bona fide elementary protofila - ment subunit of this MPL. Fibrils in the kDa/ with axial spacings of ~25 nm. Although strikingly different in morphology, the MPL of these coiled fi - brils is equivalent to that measured for protofibrils. They could therefore arise from a conformational change in the protofibril concurrent with coiling and rapid elongation. Alternatively, we cannot rule out an assembly pathway not directly related to protofibrils. In contrast, the 27\u00b13 kDa/nm fibrils correspond to a MPL of 1.5x the protofibril and thus can neither arise from a simple conformational transition nor from lat - eral association of 19 kDa/nm protofibril precursors. Twisted ribbons with axial periodicities ranging from ~80 nm to 130 nm were prominent in the 27\u00b13 kDa/nm group as well as more tightly coiled fibrils. Individual fibril ribbons had elongation rates of 20\u00b112 nm/min imaged by time-lapse scanning force micros - copy. Protofibrils exhibited growth rates ~15x slow - er at 1.3\u00b10.5 nm/min. These data support a model where concurrent multiple assembly pathways give rise to the various polymorphic fibril types. Exploring mouse articular cartilage biomechan - ics by nano-indentation In our attempts to more systematically probe the biomechanical properties of articular cartilage and to correlate these with the status of slowly progress - ing diseases such as osteoarthritis, Martin Stolz, a senior research associate in the lab, has employed indentation-type (IT) to follow the mechanical changes of the articular cartilage in the hips of strain- matched mice as a function of aging. As expected, while the articular cartilage layer gets thinner as the animals get older, the cartilage becomes stiffer when probed at the sub-micrometer scale. Concomitantly, by chemical analysis a systematic reduction of the glycosaminoglycan moiety is observed in the aging cartilage. While both changes are statistically signifi - cant, they are not as pronounced as they become in osteoarthritic cartilage observed in human biopsies. Very much like with porcine and human articular car - tilage, the measured stiffness changes are strongly scale-dependent, i.e. they are only spotted when probed at the sub-micrometer but not at the microm -Ueli Aebi eter to millimeter scale. Last but not least, we are in the process of developing IT SFM into a standard - ized procedure for rapid and reliable assessment of the mechanical quality of autologous and tissue-en - gineered cartilage aimed for transplantation into joint defects.

We have recently designed a novel type of nanoparticle with regular icosahedral symmetry and a diameter of about 16 nm, which self-assembles from single polypeptide chains. Remarkably, small viruses are composed of one single peptide chain folding into a capsid structure with icosahedral symmetry (Fig. 1a). By a superposi - tion of different protein oligomerization domains onto the symmetry axes of the icosahedron, a nanopar - ticle with icosahedral symmetry can be designed (Fig. 1b,c). In agreement with the computer model, the electron micrographs of our designed nanopar - ticles show a diameter of about 18nm (Fig 1c,d). As shown in the schematic diagram (Fig 1e) such pep - tide nanoparticles can be functionalized in several ways: (1) At either end the peptide chain can be extended with peptide sequences of a particular function. We have attached targeting peptides like somatosta - tin (Fig 1d) or bombesin to the nanoparticle. Such nanoparticles will interact with their respective re - ceptors on cancer cells. As an advantage, the high density of ligands on the surface of the particle will increase the affinity for the specific receptor due to cooperativity of binding. Other functional peptides that can be attached include e.g. NLS sequences or cell penetrating peptides like TAT. By means of covalent linkage of specific dyes (fluoresceine), che - lators (DOTA - for the binding of radionuclides for radiotherapy), or drugs can be attached at the ends of the peptide. The high density of dyes will signifi - cantly increase the signal to noise ratio in imaging applications. (2) The central cavity of the nanoparticle with a di - ameter of about 6 nm is ideally suited for the encap - sulation of quantum dots. For example, SeCd nano - crystals can be used as highly efficient fluorescence probes, gold nanoparticles as contrasting agents for electron microscopy and iron nanoparticles as probes for MRI imaging. (3) The cavity of the pentameric coiled-coil domain allows to incorporate small hydrophobic molecules such as vitamin D3. (4) Finally, the trimeric coiled-coil can be modified to allow binding of nucleic acids (like the trimeric coiled-coil of the macrophage scavenger receptor) and ultimately a gene delivery system can be engi - neered.

Such de novo designed nanoparticles eliminate the need for virus-based de - signs, and allow for high flexibility in vaccine design. Epitopes of any pathogen can readily be engineered onto the surface of the nanoparticle, thus allowing for the easy generation of a whole variety of differ - ent vaccines. We are currently developing synthetic vaccine can - didates against several major human pathogens. Immunogenic peptide sequences characteristic for these pathogens will be displayed on the surface of a peptide nanoparticle. In addition to its ability to elicit a high titer of serospecific neutralizing antibod - ies, the particulate structure will guide the nanopar - ticles to antigen presenting cells and induce CD4 proliferative responses and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, thus inducing long-term immunologic memory. Using recombinant protein expression, we are now also designing nanoparticles presenting the epitopes of any of the major Plasmodium falciparum protein antigens causing malaria (e.g. from the MSP-1, the AMA-1, the CS proteins, etc.) and HIV (e.g. from the surface proteins gp41, or gp120) repetitively and rig - idly on their surface. Using the same approach, syn - thetic subunit vaccines can also easily be designed against any other pathogens. Especially enveloped viruses (e.g. influenza, Ebola, SARS, etc.) represent an ideal target as their surface proteins are char - acterized by trimeric coiled-coil proteins, which are also building blocks of our nanoparticles. Since the peptide nanoparticles will have the same immunological properties as VLPs and since this new technology allows for the design of novel types of vaccines, we expect that it will serve as a highly versatile platform for the design of synthetic subunit vaccines. The major advantages of this concept are i) its ease of handling in terms of protein expres - sion (E. coli), protein purification and storage, hence leading to low production costs; ii) its flexibility al - lowing for a high throughput testing of different de - signs, which is especially important for HIV; iii) its suitability for the presentation of trimeric coiled-coil B-cell epitopes, which might prove to be an efficient vaccination strategy against enveloped viruses; iv) it does not need chemical coupling of the epitope to the particle as in some other approaches; and finally, v) it is not associated with a remaining risk factor as it is not infectious.

The lack of structural information is re - lated to the instability of membrane proteins in a de - tergent-solubilized state, making the growth of three- dimensional (3-D) crystals difficult. Two-dimensional (2-D) crystals of purified membrane proteins recon - stituted in the presence of lipids provide a close to native environment and allow the structure and func - tion of membrane proteins to be assessed. To this end, electron crystallography is used, and provides 3-D information at the atomic level. Membrane pro - tein surfaces are studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) at sub-nanometer resolution and in buffer so - lution, providing information about their conforma - tional variability at the single molecule level that can - not be assessed by crystallographic methods. AFM also allows the molecular arrangements of proteins in native membranes to be assessed. Combining these methods we have studied different aquaglyc - eroporins, a bacterial photosynthetic system, and the packing arrangement of rhodopsin in murine disk membranes. In parallel, we use the STEM for mass determination and single particle imaging to acquire information of biological relevance. Aquaporins (in collaboration with P . Kjellboom) Maintaining water homeostasis is essential for all liv - ing organisms. Diffusion of water through pure lipid bilayers has a high activation energy (Ea >10 kcal/ mol). The rapid flow of water through many spe - cialized membranes in plants and higher organisms requires an Ea < 5 kcal/mol, explaining the existence of special channels for water, the aquaporins. After our work on AQP1, we have crystallized two further members of this important protein family, AQP2, the regulated water channel of the renal collecting duct, and SoPIP2;1, a major aquaporin of plant plasma membranes. Both types of crystals are well ordered, and have yielded the 3D structure at 4.5 \u00c5 (AQP2) and 5 \u00c5 (SoPIP2;1). Rhodopsin (in collaboration with K. Palczewski) G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are involved in virtually all physiological processes. Crystal struc - tures are available only for the detergent-solubilized light receptor rhodopsin. Based on our atomic model of rhodopsin's dimeric packing arrangement in na - tive disk membranes, we have explored cross-link - ers to provide a biochemical proof of this model.

PuID (in collaboration with A. Pugsley) The outer membrane secretin PulD, an essential channel-forming component of the type II secretion system from Klebsiella oxytoca , was analyzed by limited proteolysis, mass spectrometry and mass measurements by STEM, and cryo-electron mi - croscopy to generate a 3D model of the homomul - timeric complex. The dodecameric channel-forming complex is composed of two rings that sandwich a closed disc. The two rings form chambers on either side of a central plug that is part of the middle disc. The PulD polypeptide comprises two major, structur - ally quite different domains, an N domain that forms the walls of one of the chambers and a trypsin-resis - tant C domain that contributes to the outer chamber, the central disc and the plug. The C domain contains a relatively low amount of -structure typical of the transmembrane segments of classical outer mem - brane proteins. A thin cylindrical structure could be identified in top views and located in the 3D model. The chamber on the periplasmic side of the mem - brane is proposed to constitute a docking site for the secreted exoprotein pullulanase. The chamber on the outside of the membrane could allow displace - ment of the plug to open the channel and allow the exoprotein to escape. VirE2 (in collaboration with M. Hegner) Agrobacterium facilitates efficient inter-kingdom transfer of ssDNA from its cytoplasm to the host plant cell nucleus. This is executed by a type IV se - cretion system, which exports specific proteins, in - cluding the relaxase VirD2, which covalently binds another protein, VirE2, enhances ssDNA transfer efficiency 2000 fold. VirE2 binds co - operatively to the T-DNA and forms a compact heli - cal structure, mediating T-DNA nuclear import. We discovered that by cooperatively binding to ssDNA, VirE2 proteins act as a powerful molecular machine, which is capable of pulling ssDNA against 50 pN loads. Because efficient ssDNA translocation relies on the presence of ssDNA binding proteins in the recipient in general, this could be a more general ssDNA import mechanism also occurring in bacterial conjugation and DNA uptake processes. The native form of VirE2 in Agrobacterium's cyto - plasm forms a complex with its specific chaperone VirE1. Unexpectedly, the VirE1VirE2 complex is able to bind to lipid vesicles, to form channels in black lip - id membranes and to bind ssDNA. Electron micros - copy showed that the VirE1VirE2-ssDNA complexes exhibited the helical structure previously observed for the VirE2-ssDNA complex. Upon ssDNA binding, VirE1 dissociates from the VirE2-ssDNA complex, implying that the stable VirE1VirE2 interaction is re - versible and that the affinity of VirE2 for ssDNA is stronger than for VirE1. We conclude that VirE2 is a multifunctional protein, whose structure is urgently required to understand its function. LcrV (in collaboration with G. Cornelis) We have used scanning transmission electron mi - croscopy (STEM) for mass determination of biomac - romolecules and their assemblies. However, the out - standing imaging capability of the STEM has given exciting results on the fine structure of a molecular needle. Dark-field images of negatively stained nee - dles of the Yersinia \"Ysc\" type-III secretion appara - tus revealed a distinct tip structure containing LcrV, a protein necessary for pore formation and known since the mid-fifties as the protective antigen against plague. Protein expression (in collaboration with A. L\u00fcthi) To produce sufficient material for structural analy - ses, we have invested a frustrating effort to obtain mammalian membrane proteins. Comparison of dif - ferent systems for their capacity to express differ - ent membrane protein classes has not as yet given conclusive results. Yeast proved to be useful for the expression of aquaporins. In this case, the protein could be harvested and purified in large quantities and crystals could be grown. Baculovirus/Sf9 ex - pressed a variety of channels and GPCRs, but at this time, we have not been able to purify enough protein for crystallization experiments. While HCN2 was functionally expressed in HEK cells infected with the Semliki Forest Virus as demonstrated with patch-clamp experiments by A. L\u00fcthi (Biozentrum), we could not even solubilize sufficient amounts of protein to explore purification conditions. Two ma - jor, possibly connected hurdles prevented progress. Misfolded proteins are known to get stuck in the ER, as observed by immunofluorescence microscopy. However, this observation might also be explained Andreas Engel 102 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Structural Biology & Biophysics by insufficient trafficking capacity; overexpressed proteins became stuck although they were properly inserted. These proteins could either not be solubi - lized, or if solubilized, they were susceptible to deg - radation. Devolpments (in collaboration with H. Hug and U. Staufer) We have pushed the development of a new atomic force microscope (AFM) that operates with small cantilevers and has a Fabry-Perot type deflection sensor. This AFM is more sensitive and faster than commercial AFMs and is expected to provide bet - ter images of soft, biological samples. First results indicate the power of this new instrument that now will be tested in multiple applications. A novel type of cantilever for measuring the topography simulta - neously with the electronic properties of the sample has been developed. These cantilevers can be ap - plied to a wide range of applications in biology, elec - trochemistry and materials processing. A new tool has been introduced for 2D crystallization (2DX). It is based on previous experience with a sys - tem that allowed 2D crystals to be grown by dilution. The new 2DX robot operates on a 96 well plate and can control the crystallization process over weeks. A prototype has been built and is currently under test. With a new set of programs developed in the frame - work of the EU Network of Excellence, 3D-EM, prog - ress has been achieved in the development of image processing tools for electron crystallography. n Wiley & Sons, Ltd, Chichester, 2005.Andreas Engel Publications Bucior, I., Scheuring, S., Engel, A. & Burger, M.M.

Engel continued some of the work as professor emeritus at the Biozen - trum in collaboration with Thomas Kiefhaber and An - nett Bachmann and members of other departments after his official retirement. He also worked during the summer periods of 2004 and 2005 as visiting scien - tist at the research department of Shriners Hospital for Children in collaboration with Hans Peter B\u00e4chinger. The present report describes a project on collagen folding, which has continued in Basel and in Portland. The project on the nematocyst wall is continued by PD Suat \u00d6zbeck in Heidelberg and Sebastian Meier in Stefan Grzesiek's research group. Daniel H\u00e4ussinger and Stefan Grzesiek also continue to work on cad - herins. The other projects described have been ter - minated. Collagen folding Different oligomerization domains were fused to both ends (N- and C-terminal) of the collagen model pep - tide (GPP)10. The disulfide knot of collagen III and the foldon domain of T4 phage fibritin were used to induce trimerization of the chains. Trimerization is required for correct alignment and triple helix nucle - ation and is achieved in natural collagen by C-termi - nal domains called propeptides. With the help of our model system, we were able to show that triple helix formation can be nucleated at either end. This is of interest in view of recent findings that triple helix for - mation in a family of collagens with transmembrane domains at their N-termini may proceed from the N- to C-end. In collaboration with Thomas Kiefhaber and Annett Bachmann we measured the rates of triple helix for - mation for the C-terminal crosslinked peptide of type III collagen in the absence of cis-trans isomerization of peptide bonds. This is normally the rate limiting step in collagen folding because of the abundance of proline and hydroxyprolines, which promote the cis-configuration. Refolding from an \"all-trans\" state was achieved by double jump experiments. By this experimental technique the triple helix is first un - folded by fast mixing with a denaturant. Following this step, the peptide bonds are maintained in trans configuration as they are present in the triple helix. Before the relatively slow trans to cis equilibration can occur the triple helix is refolded by fast dilution of the denaturant. It was found that triple helix forma - tion is 3 to 4 orders of magnitude faster without the rate limiting step of cis-trans isomerization than with it. The rate is determined by triple helix nucleation in peptide bonds and it was also possible to determine the size of the nucleus.

Nematocyst capsule wall The project deals with the elucidation of assembly of the nematocyst wall from its two major constituents minicollagen and the glycoprotein NOWA. Both con - tain homologous Cys-rich domains of only about 20 residues with 3 disulfide bonds each. The structure of this domain in the C-terminal part of minicollagen- 1 was explored by NMR spectroscopy. We were able to show that the enormous tensile strength of the capsule wall (it resists an osmotic pressure of more than 150 atmospheres) results from a cross-linking of the two proteins via disulfide bonds. Both proteins are produced as precursors with all disulfides inter - nally linked within the same Cys-rich domain. We postulate a disulfide reshuffling mechanism, which is probably catalyzed by a disulfide isomerase. NOWA was shown to bind to the surface of lipid bilayers. It may mediate the contact of the protein layer of the wall with the inner part of the surrounding lipid membrane, which originates from a vesicle expelled by the Golgi apparatus of the nematocyst producing cells. Mechanism of the homophilic interaction of cad - herins The interaction contacts between homophilically as - sociating E-cadherins was studied by a combined NMR and crystallographic approach. The most sa - lient feature of this work is the discovery of an ac - tivating conformational transition in domain CAD1, which is induced by proteolytic removal of the prodo - main preceding CAD1. The prodomain and even a single amino acid residue attached to the N-terminus of CAD1 keep this domain in an inactive state. Only after its removal, a structural rearrangement takes place by which the essential tryptophane residue in position 2 of CAD1 can dock into the hydrophobic pocket of a CAD1 domain of an interacting cadherin molecule. Interaction of agrin with laminin We solved the crystal structure of the amino-terminal domain of agrin (NtA) and defined its binding site for laminin by site directed mutagenesis. It was shown before that this domain binds to the coiled-coil struc - ture in the long arm of laminin. The binding site in laminin was mapped to a region of about 25 resi - dues. Very interestingly this coiled-coil segment of three chains binds with its -1 chain to the C-termi - nal helix in NtA. A parallel alignment of the coiled-coil structure and a helix in a globular domain may be a rather general type of interaction for specific binding of partners to coiled-coil domains. The study adds structural and thermodynamic information to the bi - ology of agrin in synapse formation. Design of oligomeric proteins We developed and tested varies oligomerization domains, and applied them for dimerization, trimer - ization is the five- stranded coiled-coil domain of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, whose structure was solved by us several years ago and which we meanwhile used for oligomerization of cadherins. Matrilincc and jun/fos - cc are three- and two-stranded coiled-coil domains which we also used in cadherin research. The foldon domain of 29 residues is of a completely different type. It originated from T4-phage fibritin, combines to a very stable obligatory trimer and serves for nu - cleation of the alignment and folding of the fibritin coiled-coil structure. We learned about this domain from a collaboration with Vadim Mesyanzhinov, Mos - cow and used it extensively for trimerization of col - lagen model peptides. Fusion of polypeptide chains with the disulfide knot domain of collagen III was also found to be a very efficient way of cross-linking by recombinant technology.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 102, 13897-902 (2005).107 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Structural Biology & Biophysics Our research focuses on the functional role of dis - tinct nuclear pore complex proteins (nucleoporins) in nuclear transport as well as other cellular processes, such as (yeast) apoptosis. The nuclear pore com - plex (NPC) is the sole gateway between the nucleus and cytoplasm of interphase eukaryotic cells, and it mediates all trafficking between these two cellular compartments. NPCs are composed of about 30 dif - ferent proteins, known as nucleoporins, and defects in nuclear transport as well as dysfunction of nucleo - porins have been detected in distinct human dis - eases, such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. Based on the structure of the NPC, we are aiming to gain a more rational understanding of the functional role of individual nucleoporins for NPC structure and function. Mapping the domain topology of individual nu - cleoporins within the 3D architecture of the NPC The NPC is composed of about 30 nucleoporins, which are typically characterized by a distinct do - main organization. A common feature of about one third of those nucleoporins is the presence of vari - able FG (phenylalanine-glycine)-repeat motifs, which are though to play critical roles in the inter - action between nucleoporins and soluble transport receptors as they traverse the NPC. In order to bet - ter understand the role of FG-repeat and other nu - cleoporin domains for NPC structure, function and nuclear transport, we have mapped the domain to - pology of the vertebrate nucleoporins Nup153 and Nup214 for different nuclear transport states as well as in response to chemical effectors, such as Ca2+ and ATP by immuno-EM (in collaboration with K. Ullman, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, and M. Powers, Emory Univer - sity School of Medicine, Atlanta). For these studies, we are using antibodies specific to the distinct do - mains of Nup153 and Nup214 in combination with pre-embedding labelling of Xenopus oocyte nuclei. Moreover, we have expressed epitope-tagged ver - sions of the two nucleoporins in Xenopus oocytes to confirm and strengthen the results we have ob - tained using the domain specific antibodies. By this approach, we could show that Nup153 and Nup214 are anchored to the NPC by their non-FG repeat do - mains, whereas their FG-repeat domains are highly flexible and mobile within the NPC (Fahrenkrog et al., 2002; Fahrenkrog and Aebi, 2003; Paulillo et al., 2005). Consistent with a role of FG-repeat domains in nuclear transport, we found that the location of the FG-repeat domains of Nup153 and Nup214 is corre - lated to the transport state of the NPC (Paulillo et al. , 2005), whereas chemical effectors have only minor Analysis of nuclear pore complex proteins in nuclear transport and other cellular processes Birthe Fahrenkrog Phone +41 61 267 16 24 Fax +41 61 267 21 09 birthe.fahrenkrog@unibas.ch www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/fahrenkrog Group Members Sara M.

We have now switched our in - terest on the function of the non-FG-repeat domains of Nup153 and Nup214. In search of the link between the nuclear pore complex and yeast apoptosis In the past few years it became evident that mediat - ing nuclear transport is not the only function of the NPC, but that the NPC is linked to, for example, chromosome segregation. kinetochore integrity, the secretory pathway and apoptosis (Fahrenkrog and Aebi, 2003; Fahrenkrog et al., 2004a). In this con - text, our studies on the yeast nucleoporin Nic96p have led us to the identification of the nuclear ser - ine protease Nma111p, which we found to promote apoptosis in yeast (Fahrenkrog et al. , 2004b). To elu - cidate the molecular function of Nma111p in yeast apoptosis, we were aiming to identify substrates of Nma111p that might be related to the yeast cell death program (in collaboration with F. Madeo, University of Graz). This led us to the identification of the inhibi - tor-of-apoptosis protein Bir1p as a direct interacting partner of Nma111p (Walter et al., 2006). Moreover, we could show that Bir1p is degraded by Nma111p in vivo , which enhances apoptosis, whereas over- expression of Bir1p inhibited the programmed cell death. We are now studying the interplay between Nma111p and Bir1p in more depth as well as the highly interesting link between the yeast NPC and yeast apoptosis.

Our work is directed towards problems in structural biology where NMR can give unique information: 1. The determination of biomolecular structures and interactions which are difficult to obtain by other methods. A special emphasis is put onto biomo - lecular pathogens, not completely folded structures, and membrane-associated proteins. 2. The study of macromolecular complexes where NMR yields infor - mation on interaction surfaces, the strength of the interaction and the dynamics, and thereby offers in - sights into biomacromolecular mechanisms 3. The study of forces that are relevant for macromolecular folding. Structural Projects Brinker The Brinker (Brk) nuclear repressor an essential component the Drosophila Decapentaplegic mor- phogenic signaling pathway. Its N-terminal part binds to GC-rich DNA sequences and has weak homol - ogy to the Antennapedia homeodomain. We have determined the conformation and dynamics of the N-terminal 101 amino acids of Brk in the absence and presence of its cognate DNA by solution NMR spectroscopy (Figure 1). In the absence of DNA, Brk is unfolded at room temperature and highly flexible on the subnanosecond time scale throughout the entire backbone. Addition of cognate DNA induces the formation of a well-folded structure for residues R46 to R95. It consists of four helices forming a helix-turn-helix motif that differs from the three-he - lical homeodomains, but has fold similarity to the Tc3 transposase, the Pax-6 Paired domain, and the human centromere binding protein. The specificity of GC-rich DNA recognition can be rationalized by specific major groove hydrogen bond contacts from the N-terminal end of helix 2. The transition from a highly flexible, completely unfolded structure in the absence of DNA to a well-formed complex struc - ture presents a very extreme case of the 'coupling of binding and folding' phenomenon (Cordier et al. manuscript in preparation; in collaboration with M. Affolter).High resolution NMR of biological macromolecules Stephan Grzesiek Phone +41 61 267 21 00 Fax +41 61 267 21 09 stephan.grzesiek@unibas.ch www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/grzesiek Group Members Martin Regula Aregger Sonja Pernille Jensen M.

Kiefhaber (Biozentrum) Neyer Biology & Biophysics T4 fibritin Foldon We have obtained a very detailed NMR (Meier et al., 2004a) and stopped-flow (Guthe et al., 2004) char - acterization of the folding of foldon, which is the C- terminal domain of T4 fibritin (Figure 2). This domain is obligatory for the formation of the fi - britin trimer structure and can be used as an artificial trimerization domain. Its native structure consists of a trimeric -hairpin propeller (PDB-code of solved foldon trimer disintegrates into a monomeric (A-state) form that has similar properties as an early intermediate of the trimer folding pathway. The formation of this A-state monomer from the trimer, its structure, thermody - namic stability, equilibrium association and folding dynamics have been characterized to atomic detail by modern high-resolution NMR techniques. The foldon A-state monomer forms a -hairpin with intact and stable H-bonds that is similar to the monomer in the foldon trimer, but lacks a defined structure in its N- and C-terminal parts. Its thermodynamic stabil -ity in pure water is comparable to designed hairpins stabilized in alcohol/water mixtures. Details of the thermal unfolding of the foldon A-state have been characterized by chemical shifts and re - sidual dipolar couplings (RDCs) detected in inert, mechanically stretched polyacrylamide gels. At the onset of the thermal transition, small uniform rela - tive changes in RDC values indicate a uniform de - crease of local N-HN and C-H order parameters for the hairpin strand residues. In contrast, near-turn residues show particular thermal stability in RDC values and hence in local order parameters. This co - incides with increased transition temperatures of the -turn residues observed by chemical shifts. At high temperatures, the RDCs converge to non-zero aver - age values consistent with predictions from random chain polymer models. Residue-specific deviations above the unfolding transition reveal the persistence of residual order around prolines, large hydrophobic residues and at the -turn. These results show that a very large number of physico-chemical parameters of the folding process can be obtained from a rigorous combination of mod - ern high-resolution NMR techniques. In particular, 1DNH and 1DCH RDCs provide new information on structural preferences within the unfolded and par - tially unfolded monomer states. A further increase in the number of determined RDCs is possible, e.g. by the detection of sidechain or long-range RDCs or by using different alignment conditions. This may ultimately lead to a complete quantification of local order in folding/unfolding transitions (in collaboration with T. Kiefhaber). Homoassociation of Cadherin Cadherins are single pass transmembrane glycopro teins, which mediate calcium dependent cell-cell ad - hesion by homophilic interactions. A detailed under - standing of the calcium-induced homoassociation of cadherin is missing. In the last years, we have exten - sively characterized this homoassociation by NMR spectroscopy in vitro. Cadherins are made as imma - ture precursor proteins, which are activated by the proteolytic cleavage of an N-terminal prosequence. We have now been able to follow this proteolytic ac - tivation mechanism in atomic detail for a model pre - cursor in the NMR tube (Haussinger et al. , 2004) (in collaboration with J. Engel).Stephan Grzesiek Figure 1: Interaction between Brinker and its cognate DNA.

The TipA protein is one such multidrug resistance protein in Streptomyces lividans , which regulates its own ex - pression by binding to its own promotor upon anti - biotic binding. The protein consists of a multidrug binding domain and a DNA binding part. After solv - ing the structure of the drug binding TipAS domain in the free form, we have now solved one structure in complex with the antibiotic Nosiheptide. The results show that upon drug binding, the protein undergoes a dramatic structural change from a half-folded form to a fully folded form (Jensen et al. , in preparation; in collaboration with C. Thompson). TOR FATC The target of rapamycin, TOR, is a highly conserved ser/thr kinase that plays a central role in the control of cellular growth. TOR has a characteristic multi-do - main structure. Only the kinase domain has catalytic function; the other domains are assumed to mediate interactions with TOR-substrates and -regulators. Except for the rapamycin-binding domain, there is no high-resolution structural data available for TOR. We have carried out a structural, biophysical, and mutagenesis study of the extremely conserved car - boxy-terminal FATC domain of TOR (Dames et al., 2005). The importance of this domain for TOR func - tion has been demonstrated in several publications. Our data show that the FATC domain in its oxidized form exhibits a novel structural motif consisting of an -helix and a C-terminal disulfide-bonded loop. Upon reduction, the flexibility of the loop region increases dramatically (in collaboration with M. Hall). Minicollagen cysteine-rich domains Minicollagens from Hydra are the smallest known collagens to date. They are found in the walls of ne - matocysts, which are explosive organelles formed from a post-Golgi vesicle in Hydra , jellyfish, corals and other Cnidaria . Nematocyst walls are stabilized by a collageneous matrix, which depends on disul - fide crosslinking to withstand the extreme osmotic pressure of up to 150 bar. The Hydra capsule wall mainly consists of the proteins minicollagen and NOWA. Both proteins contain highly homologous cysteine- and proline-rich domains, called minicolla - gen cysteine rich domains (MCRDs). Minicollagens are expressed as soluble precursor forms with intra - molecular disulfide bonds in their MCRDs. In nema - tocyst development a wall hardening occurs, during which the intramolecular MCRD disulfide bonds are most likely reshuffled to intermolecular bonds, there - by crosslinking molecules within the capsule wall. We have determined a high-precision solution struc - ture of the C-terminal minicollagen cysteine rich domain of Hydra using modern heteronuclear and weak alignment NMR techniques at natural isotope abundance 1SP7) (Meier et al., 2004b; Pokidysheva et al. , 2004). The domain consists of only 24 amino acids, six of which are prolines and six are cysteines bonded in disulfide bridges that constrain the structure into a new fold. With six cys - teines in a folded core of only 20 structured amino acids, this MCRD represents one of the sequences Stephan Grzesiek 0 10 20 5 15 25 residue-1001040 45 50 55 60 65 70 80T/C1DNH[Hz] A Y V R D G E W V L LNOK N O NO N23N O 12ONO N OA Y V R DGEWVLL NO KNNON N OO N ON O OAYV RDG E W V L LN O O KN N O NNO ONO NO 17 181212 232317 1718 18 Figure 2: Structure and foldon.

The redox equilibrium of the structure has been characterized from a titration with glutathione. No local native structures are detectable in the re - duced form. Thus oxidation and folding are tightly coupled (in collaboration with J. Engel). NMR technique development Hydrogen bond detection Hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) are essential for the stabilization of protein and nucleic acid secondary structure and often play a fundamental role in the regulation of enzymatic reactions. However, until re - cently, most of the evidence for hydrogen bonds in biological macromolecules was indirect either from the spatial proximity of donor and acceptor groups or from H-bond related parameters such as reduced hydrogen exchange rates. In 1998, we and others discovered that surprisingly strong NMR-observable scalar couplings exist across H-bonds. This effect can be used to \"see\" all three partners of a H-bond directly in an NMR experiment, i.e. the donor, the acceptor and the proton itself. Thus, the H-bond con - nectivity pattern of biomacromolecules (and there - fore the secondary structure) can be established directly via a COSY experiment. The effect itself is caused by the overlap of H-bond acceptor and hy - drogen electronic orbitals and thus can be related to the H-bond geometry. For recent review see (Grze - siek et al., 2004). In the last two years, we have extended the research on this effect in several ways. (1) We have quantita - tively characterized the backbone H-bond network of the partially folded A-state of ubiquitin (Cordier and Grzesiek, 2004). The results show intact, native-like H-bonds of the first -hairpin 1/2 and the -helix, albeit at lower strength, whereas the H-bonds in the C-terminal part change from a pure -structure in the native state to an all--helical HN(i)O(i-4) connec - tivity pattern in the A-state. (2) We have character - ized strength of the internal H-bond network of a DNA guanine quadruplex for various cation-bound forms over a wide temperature range (Dingley et al., 2005). The variations in H-bond strength exhibit an overall trend Na+ > K+ > NH4+ and correlate with the different cation positions and N2 -H2N7 H-bond lengths in the respective structures. The temperature depen - dence revealed a significantly higher thermal stabil - ity of H-bond geometries in the DNA quadruplexes as compared to nucleic acid duplexes, which can be rationalized by the cation coordination and extensive H-bond network of the quadruplexes. (3) We have Stephan Grzesiek quantified the effect of amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange on the strength of protein H-bonds, which leads to a small decrease in donor acceptor wave - function overlap (Jaravine et al., 2004). New structural and dynamical information from weak alignment techniques In recent years, the weak alignment of biomolecules in anisotropic liquid phases has become a tool to directly monitor average net orientations and order parameters of individual bonds by residual dipolar couplings (RDCs). We are using and developing (Jensen et al., 2004) this technology with the aim to obtain new and highly precise information on the structure and dynamics of folded and unfolded pro - teins. In particular, a collaboration with the groups of Mar - tin Blackledge from the IBS in Grenoble, and Rafael Br\u00fcschweiler at the US National High-Field Magnet Lab has resulted in a novel approach to character - ize the slow time scale dynamics of proteins in so - lution (Bouvignies et al., 2005). Analysis of a very large set of RDCs by a 3D axial fluctuation model revealed an intriguing pattern of standing waves across the -sheet of protein G involved in binding to immunoglobulin G implying maximal conformational sampling at the interaction site. These findings sug - gest that dynamical information can be transmitted across a long-range network of hydrogen bonds in proteins.

Stephan Grzesiek114 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Structural Biology & Biophysics Lipid rafts are considered functional membrane do - mains in vivo that sequester certain proteins and play a key role in signalling and other functions. It has been assumed that such rafts can be isolated from biological membranes as so-called detergent- resistant membrane (DRM) fragments and much of what we mean to know about rafts is based on this technique. However, as discussed in our paper in TiBS (Lichtenberg et al., 2005), there is no convinc - ing proof for the idea that DRMs are identical with in vivo rafts. Instead, the detergent isolation technique could, in the worst case, even induce the formation of artificial domains that are then mistaken for rafts. Van Rheenen et al. (2005) have tested our predic - tion of detergent-induced domain formation and con - firmed its relevance in vivo . The phenomenon of detergent-induced domain for - mation in membranes is confirmed but it may be counterintuitive that a membrane-disordering agent like Triton should induce and/or promote the forma - tion of ordered domains. To shed light on this issue, we established a simple model describing the equilib - rium of two lipids and a detergent in four phases (or - dered and disordered membrane phases, micelles, monomers) and studied the effect of varying deter - gent concentration on the existence, abundance and composition of the different phases (Keller et al. , 2005). Different scenarios are obtained, and deter - gent-induced domain formation is predicted specifi - cally for the case of an unfavourable nonideal inter - action between the detergent and an order-loving lipid such as cholesterol or sphingomyelin. We have, indeed, observed such unfavourable inter - actions between Triton and cholesterol (Tsamalou - kas et al. 2006a). In detergent-free systems, there is also a certain tendency towards de-mixing that is based on favourable SM-cholesterol and unfavour - able POPC-cholesterol interactions, but this effect may be overcompensated by the entropy of ideal mixing.

In order to assess affinities and interaction enthal - pies of cholesterol with PC vs. SM (Tsamaloukas et al., 2006b), we have established three new assays for isothermal titration calorimetry that are based on the re-partitioning of cholesterol between mem - branes and complexes with cyclodextrin in solution (Tsamaloukas et al. , 2005). Relationship between volumetric, thermodynam - ic and structural properties in colloidal systems The rather new method of pressure perturbation calorimetry provides information on the temperature- dependent thermal volume expansion of a solute or colloidal particle in aqueous dispersion. The goal of the project is to explore the potential of this param - eter for a better understanding of colloidal systems, primarily their packing and hydration characteristics. To obtain a comprehensive picture, PPC experi - ments are combined with structural investigations (light scattering, SANS) and thermodynamic tech - niques. We have applied this approach to micelle formation (in preparation), a micellar sphere-to-rod transition (Heerklotz et al. , 2004) and the putative liquid disordered - liquid ordered phase equilibrium in lipid vesicles containing cholesterol (submitted). Interactions of drugs and antibiotic peptides with membranes We have been continuing our studies on the mech - anism of action of membrane-active compounds. Deuterium NMR studies provided information on the localization of surfactin, an antibiotic peptide from bacillus subtilis, in membranes and its effect on membrane structure (Heerklotz et al., 2004). A key property of drugs and membrane-active compounds is their membrane permeation rate and mechanism. Our approach to this problem is based on a com - bination of solute uptake and release assays, the model for which was recently extended to ionic spe -cies (Keller et al., 2006a). This method was also ap - plied to characterize the membrane permeabilization of transdermal penetration enhancers (Barrow et al., 2005). Rationalization and optimization of the solubili - zation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) GPCRs are the largest and most important class of drug targets, but relatively little is known about their structure and mode of action. One reason for that is the problem to solubilize them in a functional state, a question that usually requires many years of largely empirical search for suitable conditions. Our project aims at establishing a rational approach to the choice of detergents and conditions for solubili - zation and reconstitution of GPCRs. An empirically optimized protocol for the peripheral cannabinoid re - ceptor CB2 is, for example, based on a solubilization buffer containing three different detergents in certain proportions, gylcerol and salts (Yeliseev et al. , 2005). Starting with a visit to the NIH in 2005, we have been investigating the effect of changes of these optimized conditions (e.g., addition of other detergents etc.) on the stability and activity of the receptor. Furthermore, we are developing quantitative models for describing membrane solubilization by such a complex mixture; existing models are largely limited to the practically unrealistic case of a single detergent component.

We use differ - ent approaches to gain insight into the mechanism of protein folding. Kinetic measurements of unfold - ing and refolding reactions of small model proteins are aimed at the detection and characterization of partially folded intermediates between the unfolded protein and the native state and at the characteriza - tion of the rate-limiting steps in the folding process. Studies on peptide models investigate the earliest steps in protein folding like intrachain diffusion and secondary structure formation. Different experimen - tal techniques are applied that allow us to study con - formational dynamics from the femtoseconds to the hours time range. Elementary steps in protein folding. During folding a protein has to form interactions be - tween specific parts of the polypeptide chain. Intra - chain diffusion can thus be regarded as the elemen - tary step in the folding process, which determines the maximum rate at which a folding polypeptide chain can explore conformational space. We have devel - oped a model system to directly measure contact formation between two defined points on a polypep - tide chain using triplet-triplet energy transfer (TTET; for a review see Fierz & Kiefhaber, 2005). In collaboration with the group of W. Zinth (LMU M\u00fcnchen) we characterized all photochemical re - actions involved in the TTET process. The results showed that the photochemistry of this system is fast and thus allows measurements of chain dynamics of processes slower than 5-10 ns (Satzger et al., 2004). We measured TTET in various model peptides and natural loop sequences from proteins to study the effects of amino acid sequence, chain length, tem - perature, and solvent properties on the process of intrachain diffusion (Krieger et al., 2004; M\u00f6glich et Mechanism and Dynamics of Protein Folding Thomas Kiefhaber Phone +41 61 267 21 94 Fax +41 61 267 21 89 t.kiefhaber@unibas.ch www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/kiefhaber Group Members Annett Christophe a tri - plet donor to a triplet acceptor group to measure intrach - ain diffusion in polypeptide chains. 118 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Structural Biology & Biophysics al., 2005; Krieger et al., 2005).

The dynamics depend on the number of amino acids separating donor and acceptor and show a maximum time constant of 5-10 ns for flexible chains. These results set an upper limit for the speed of formation of the first side chain contacts during protein folding and suggest that typical protein loops can form on a timescale of 30 to 50 ns. The minimum time con - stant for contact formation at the ends of very tight turns and in elements of secondary structure is in the range of 5-10 ns. Folding Mechanism of Small Single Domain Pro - teins Several small proteins were shown to fold very fast (typically on the millisecond time scale) and without detectable intermediates. Our group uses several single domain proteins including the DNA-binding domain of brinker, Hsp15, parvalbumin and tendami - stat as model systems to study folding and stabil - ity of fast folding proteins. To obtain insight into the barriers for protein folding we applied various kinetic concepts from physical organic chemistry to protein folding reactions (Bodenreider & Kiefhaber, 2005; for a review see Bachmann et al. , 2005). Analysis of folding data from our lab and of data reported in liter - ature on other proteins allowed us to obtain a gener - al picture of the properties of free energy landscapes for protein folding reactions. The results indicate that folding transition states are narrow regions on the free energy landscape which are robust against perturbations like mutations or changes in solvent conditions. Apparent transition state movements fre - quently observed in mutational studies were shown to be due to ground state effects, most commonly caused by structural changes in the unfolded state. We could show that the sensitivity in the detection of transition state movements can be improved by applying multiple perturbations. This allowed a more detailed characterization of the shape of the free en - ergy barriers for protein folding reactions (Sch\u00e4tzle & Kiefhaber, 2006). Folding of Multidomain and Oligomeric Proteins Model proteins for studies on the mechanism of protein folding are usually not optimized for rapid folding but rather for function in the cell. We have investigated more complex folding reactions of two proteins, which have a strong evolutionary pressure for rapid and efficient folding. The first system is a protease from Semliki Forest Virus (SFVP), which is a two-domain protein and has to cleave itself out of a large polyprotein chain cotranslationally during pro - tein synthesis. Rapid folding and cleavage of SFVP is essential for the biogenesis of the more C-termi - nal peptide segments in the viral polyprotein, since self-cleavage of the SFVP releases a signal peptide sequence at the newly generated N-terminus of the nascent chain. This directs the remaining polyprotein to the endoplasmic reticulum. To test whether fast co-translational folding of SFVP is an intrinsic prop - erty of the polypeptide chain or whether folding is accelerated by cellular components, we investigated spontaneous folding of recombinant SFVP in vitro, in collaboration with the group of R. Glockshuber (ETH Z\u00fcrich). The results showed that SFVP folds more than two orders of magnitude faster than any pre - viously studied two-domain protein ( =50 ms), and that structure formation in the N-terminal domain precedes folding of the C-terminal domain. This demonstrates that co-translational folding of SFVP does not require additional cellular components and suggests that rapid folding is the result of molecular evolution towards efficient virus biogenesis (S\u00e1n - chez et al., 2004). The second model protein to study a complex folding process is the C-terminal domain from the trimeric phage T4 protein fibritin. The only known function of this small domain (3x27 amino acids) is the pro - motion of rapid folding and association of fibritin. In collaboration with the group of S. Grzesiek (Biozen - trum) we could show that a chemically synthesized Thomas Kiefhaber Schematic representation of the time constants for the first steps in formation of loops, -hairpins and -helices during protein folding derived from TTET experiments. 119 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Structural Biology & Biophysics foldon-domain folds into the same trimeric -propel - ler structure as in full-length fibritin (3x486 amino ac - ids) and undergoes a two-state unfolding transition from folded trimer to unfolded monomers (G\u00fcthe et al., 2004). The folding kinetics of the foldon domain involve several consecutive reactions. Structure formation in the region of the single -hairpin of each mono - mer occurs on the sub-milliseconds time scale. This reaction is followed by two consecutive association steps with rate constants around 6\u00b7106 M-1s-1, which is similar to the fastest reported bimolecular asso - ciation reactions in protein folding. At low protein concentrations folding follows apparent third-order kinetics. At high protein concentrations, folding be - comes independent of protein concentration with a half-time of about 3 ms, indicating that a first-order folding step from a partially folded trimer to the native protein becomes rate-limiting. Our results suggest that all steps on the folding/trimerization pathway of the foldon domain are evolutionary optimized for very rapid and specific initiation of trimer formation during fibritin assembly. The results further imply that optimized folding landscapes for oligomeric proteins have different properties than those for monomeric proteins.Publications G\u00fcthe, S., Kapinos.

These are character - ized by a highly conserved catalytic domain and a coiled-coil fraction (CC) involved in the regulation of their activity. DMPK is thought to be involved in modulation of plasma membrane depolarization, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton during tis - sue development and, possibly, synaptic plasticity. DMPK might be related to a progressive neuromus - cular disorder known as Myotonic Dystrophy (DM), the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults - although, its involvement in disease remains polemic. We aim at understanding the complex mechanism of regulation of this kinase, in particular its activa - tion by dimerization and its intrasteric modulation. Self-assembly is crucial for the regulation of DMPK and related kinases. Their CC domains are thought to form dimeric arrangements and, thus, to mediate dimerization in these enzymes. We have established the principles of DMPK assembly by a combination of X-ray crystallography, small angle X-ray scatter - ing (SAXS), ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle static light scattering (SEC-MALS) applied to full-length DMPK and its component domains (Garcia et al ., 2004; Garcia et al., 2006). Contrary to expectations, the self-assembly of DMPK is not dictated by the as - sociation properties of its CC domain, which per se does not form dimers. Instead, it appears driven by sequence segments flanking both N- and C-termini of the catalytic kinase fraction, leading to the forma - tion of head-to-head dimers. Our findings support a shared pattern of assembly across DMPK, ROCKs and MRCK members of this family. Although it is yet to be proven whether these kinases follow the same regulatory principles. Molecular basis of muscle elasticity The giant muscle protein titin constitutes the third filament system in skeletal and cardiac muscle of vertebrates. It is composed of 27'000 to 33'000 resi - dues (according to isoforms), which fold into ~300 Ig and FnIII modules assembled into linear arrays that span over 1 \u00b5m length - from the Z-disc, at the begin - ning of the sarcomere, to the central M-line. Among other cellular roles, titin contributes to sarco - mere assembly, stretch-stress response and muscle elasticity. The latter is achieved via passive restoring forces generated by its elastic central I-band region, OLGA MAYANS Protein X-ray crystallography Olga Mayans Phone +41 61 267 20 83 Fax +41 61 267 21 09 olga.mayans@unibas.ch www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/mayans Group Members Marco Marino Pilar Erik Assistant Gr\u00fctter 122 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Structural Biology & Biophysics which primarily comprises tandem repeats of mul - tiple Ig domains. We have recently performed a com - prehensive analysis of the building-blocks of these tandems (Marino et al., 2005). Filamentous and modular protein architectures, such as those of titin, are characterized by intrinsic flex - ibility and a poorly defined long-range order, which defies characterization by X-ray crystallography. Despite this challenge, we have recently suceeded in solving the crystal structures of several poly-Ig fragments from titin. For the smallest of those frag - ments, that of the N-terminus of titin comprising two- Ig (Z1Z2) connected by a flexible linker, we have performed a comprehensive characterization of its conformational dynamics using X-ray crystallogra - phy, SAXS, NMR relaxation studies and residual di - polar couplings (Marino et al., 2006). The existence of a possible preferential conformational pathway in this molecule is under analysis. Z1Z2 is the binding site of a small protein relevant to muscle disease, telethonin, which caps the titin filament, anchoring it to the Z-disc. The structure of Z1Z2 in complex with telethonin has been recently elucidated (Zou et al. , 2006). Z1Z2 constitutes the first Ig-tandem of titin for which an architectural, dynamic and binding charac - terization becomes completed. This is expected to serve as a model system to understand further the molecular mechanisms of poly-Ig arrays of titin. Metabolic Evolution The tryptophan biosynthesis pathway is the major metabolic route under study after the glycolysis. Data on its genetics, biochemistry and the structure of its enzymes makes it now a unique model for the elucidation of multi-level relations in enzyme evolu - tion. We are engaged in the study of several members of the pathway. One of them, anthranilate phosphori - bosyltransferase (AnPRT, also known as TrpD), is a key evolutionary link in metabolic nucleotide/nucleo - side processing. The metabolic synthesis and degra - dation of essential nucleotide compounds is primar - ily carried out by phosphoribosyltransferases (PRT) and nucleoside phosphorylases (NP), respectively. Despite the resemblance of their reactions, five un - related families of PRTs and NPs exist, where An - PRT constitutes the only evolutionary link between synthesis and salvage enzymes. We have charac - terized the active site of dimeric AnPRT by elucidat - ing crystal structures of the wild-type enzyme com - plexed to its two natural substrates: anthranilate and PRPP/Mg2+. These bind into two different domains within each protomer and are brought together dur - ing catalysis by rotational domain motions as shown by small angle X-ray scattering data. Steady-state kinetics of mutated AnPRT variants address the role of active site residues in binding and catalysis. Re - sults allow the comparative analysis of PRT and py - rimidine NP families and expose recurrent structural motifs, which having evolved independently, reveal the common basis of nucleotide/nucleoside recogni - tion across the unrelated enzymes. This work illustrates how metabolic enzymes have a high potential for interconversion of their activities and, thus, can be recruited by other cellular path - ways according to organismic requirements.

Sugar transporters of the bacterial phosphoryl- transfer-system The PEP-dependent carbohydrate:phosphotrans - ferase system (PTS) across the inner membrane to solute phosphoryla - tion. The PTS is ubiquitous in bacteria, but not found in eukaryotes rendering it an attractive target for nov - el antibiotics. The PTS consists of general proteins (enzyme I and HPr) and sugar-specific components (enzymes II). Latter are comprised of several struc - tural domains or subunits: IIA and IIB are hydrophilic cytoplasmic and catalyze the phospho - relay, whereas IIC (IID) is integrated in the plasma membrane and catalyzes translocation. We have been studying the mannose specific PTS and have solved the structures of the IIA and IIB do - mains. The transition state for phosphoryl transfer between IIA and IIB has been modeled based on the individual X-ray structures. The model of the com - plex shows surface and charge complementarity at the interface. The penta-coordinated phosphoryl group appears to be stabilized by the partial dipole charges of two helices, one from each protein. Presently, the major effort of our research is the structure determination of sucrose permease IIBC from Salmonella domains: membrane-spanning that is covalently linked to a cytosolic IIB domain. This protein was chosen, because its IIB domain may fa - cilitate crystal formation by providing additional hy - drophilic surface. Active IIBC has been successfully expressed in E. coli and purified. The homogeneity of the sample was verified by ultracentrifugation and electron microscopy. Extensive screening of crystal - lization conditions has been undertaken, but crystals of suitable quality for structure determination have not yet been obtained. In parallel, we are attempting to crystallize IIBC in complex with an antibody frag - ment. Respective monoclonal antibodies have been produced and selected for their ability to bind con - formational epitopes.

They allow the uptake of nutrients by passive diffusion through an intrinsic pore that extends along the axis of the transmembrane -barrel structure. Recently, several new porins displaying properties different to those of the classical and structurally characterized porin family have been reported. We are studying KdgM, a major outer membrane protein of the plant pathogen Erwinia chrysanthemi , that is thought to act as an oligogalacturonate specific porin used by the bacte - ria during the course of plant infection. In collabo - ration with G. Condemine (Villeurbanne, France), KdgM, as well as homologues from Escherichia coli (NanC) and Yersinia pestis (KdgN), have been over - expressed and purified. Reproducible protein crys - tals have been obtained, but are still not of sufficient quality. The X-ray structure of this porin together with further functional characterization should shed light onto the structure-function relationships of this new class of porins. Aquaporin from the mammalian eye lens Aquaporins are found in various eukaryotic mem - branes and in the bacterial plasma membrane. They exhibit exquisite specificity for water or glycerol. In collaboration with P. Agre (Baltimore, USA) and A. Engel (Biozentrum) we have obtained crystals of re - combinant eye lens AQP0 that diffract to 7 \u00c5 resolu - tion. Despite the poor resolution, we were able to determine the crystal packing by molecular replace - ment. Octamers that are formed by tight head-to- head association of tetramers are the building blocks of the lattice. Possibly, this interaction reflects the in vivo situation, where AQP0 is known to be essen - tial for mediating the tight stacking of lens fiber cell membranes. Two-component response regulator PleD Recent discoveries suggest that a novel second messenger, c-diGMP, is extensively used by bacte - ria to control multicellular behavior. Condensation of two GTP to the dinucleotide is catalyzed by the widely distributed diguanylate cyclase domain that occurs in various combinations with sensory and/or regulatory modules. PleD, which is part of a signal - ing pathway regulating the developmental cycle of Caulobacter crescentus , is composed of two (CheY like) input domains and an output domain that bears no obvious structural homology to any existing fold. Recently, the group of U. Jenal (Biozentrum) showed that PleD is a tightly regulated diguanylate cyclase. In collaboration with the Jenal group and the group of B. Giese (Chemistry Department), we have de - termined the crystal structure of full-length PleD in complex with its product c-diGMP. The structure re - veals the catalytic mechanism for the condensation of two GTP molecules to c-diGMP by the adenylate cyclase like output domain, but also reveals an un - expected second product binding site that is respon - sible for strong feed-back inhibition. A mechanistic model for the regulation of this response regulator (activation by dimerization, inhibition by domain im - mobilization\") has been proposed. To contribute further to our knowledge about the regulation of c-diGMP levels in bacterial cells, we have recently started to investigate c-diGMP specific phosphodiesterases. Effector proteins of the type IV secretion system Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are utilized by many bacterial pathogens for the delivery of viru - lence proteins or protein-DNA complexes into their eukaryotic target cells. In collaboration with the Dehio group (Biozentrum), we are working on the Tilman Schirmer Crystal structure of the response regulator PleD.

Plant and insect allergens Allergic reactions caused by insects and plants are the paradigm of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reac - tions which affect more than 20% of the population. Specific immunotherapy (SIT) is the only effective treatment, but it is hampered by the danger of IgE- mediated anaphylactic side effects. Successful SIT operates at the level of T-helper cells leading to the modulation of the immune response. Therefore, for safe SIT, allergen variants should be created which possess intact T-cell recognition sites, whereas IgE binding sites are abolished. With this aim, we de - termined the structure of hyaluronidase, the main allergen of bee venom, in complex with a specific Fab antibody fragment. It was revealed that the Fab fragment recognizes a protruding helix-turn-helix substructure of the antigen. Truncation of this motif may lead to a hypoallergen for SIT. Also, we have determined the structure of celery allergen Api g 1, a homologue of the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1. The analysis of its surface revealed three conserved epitopes which may account for cross-reactivity with Bet v 1 and provide a molecular basis for a better un - derstanding of the pollen induced fruit and vegetable cross-reactivity.

In recent years, a role for actin in classic nuclear functions such as gene transcription, RNA processing and ribonucleoprotein transport has emerged and has settled the long - standing debate over the existence of actin in the nucleus. Although the dual localization of actin in cy - toplasm and nuclei is meanwhile accepted, the form of actin in the nucleus remains enigmatic. Evidence for an uncommon polymeric actin in the nuclear pe - riphery and the detection of numerous proteins that regulate actin patterning in the nucleus, suggest that both monomeric and oligomeric or polymeric forms of actin are at play and that the equilibrium between them, perhaps differentially regulated at various in - tranuclear sites, may be a major determinant of nu - clear function. We are analyzing the structure and function of nuclear actin in different model systems. Conformation-specific antibodies reveal distinct actin structures in the nucleus and the cyto - plasm One approach we have adopted to study different forms of actin is to generate specific actin monoclo - nal antibodies (mAbs). For epitope buried in the F-actin filament. In monomeric actin, as well as in the LD, the epitope is surface-exposed. In immu - nofluorescence studies different cell lines, 1C7 selectively reacts with non-filamentous actin in the cytoplasm and detects a discrete form of actin in the nucleus. Upon latrunculin-induced disassembly of the filamentous cytoskeleton in fibroblasts, we ob - served a perinuclear accumulation of the 1C7-reac - tive actin conformation, as well as an assembly of phalloidin-staining actin structures in chromatin-free regions of the nucleus. Our results indicate that dis - tinct actin conformations and/or structures are pres - ent in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of different cell types and that their distribution varies in response to external signals. LD is a unconventional dimeric form of actin that we and others have observed at the onset of po - lymerization in vitro (Schoenenberger et al., 1999; 2002). In this transiently formed actin species, the subunits assume a conformation that does not occur in F-actin filaments at steady state. In contrast, LD accumulates in the presence of the actin depolymer - izing drug latrunculin.

Nanoparticles devised in P. Burkhard's laboratory mimic small, rigid viral cap - sids, which, because of the repetitive antigen, display have been shown to elicit a high titer of serospecific neutralizing antibodies. To test the antigenicity of nanoparticles we grafted actin sequences represent - ing the hydrophobic plug, which is buried in the actin filament, onto their surface. Immunization with 'plug particles' indeed produced a high titer immune re - sponse in mice and a number of actin-specific mAb were established. Immunofluorescence studies on cells revealed that these mAbs labeled actin fila - ments only once the epitope had been exposed. We have also engineered nanoparticles that display an LD-related epitope on their surface and the resulting antibodies are under investigation. Novel regulatory mechanisms for S100A1 in car - diac function Heart Failure is a condition initiated by impairment of the heart's function as a pump. Factors that lead to abnormal contraction and relaxation in the fail - ing heart include insufficient energy metabolism as well as abnormal Ca2+-handling. We have shown that the Ca2+-binding protein S100A1, which is the most abundant S100 protein in the heart, modu - lates the Ca2+ turnover in cardiomyocytes. A rise in intracelullar S100A1 leads to an improved Ca2+-cy- cling which, depending on the intracellular location of the extra S100A1, involves an increased lemmal Ca2+ sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) an enhanced SERCA2a activity. In collaboration with P. Most's group, we have found that cardiac-restricted overexpression of S100A1 in the failing heart leads to increased myocardial con - tractility in vitro and in vivo . Based on our recent discovery of an interaction of S100A1 with the F1- ATPase, new functions for S100A1 in cardiac energy metabolism are emerging. In order to elucidate the role of S100A1 in cardiac energy metabolism, we have started to examine the effects of overexpres - sion and knockdown of S100A1 protein levels on the ATPase activity in cardiomyocytes. Specifically, we have established that differences of intracellular S100A1 protein levels significantly modify both ATP production and Ca2+-homeostasis. Future studies aim at unveiling the role of S100A1 in linking Ca2+- cycling to the heart's energy metabolism. Schoenenberger, C-A., S., Boerries, R., Aebi, Jockusch, B.M. (2005).

Pgp prevents cytosolic ac - cumulation of exogenous toxins or drugs and endog - enous waste products by binding them in the cyto - solic plasma membrane leaflet and flipping them to the outer leaflet, using the energy of ATP hydrolysis. The activity of Pgp is enhanced when the cells are weakened e.g. due to the lack of nutrients (Gatlik- Landwojtowicz et al. 2004). In humans Pgp is ex - pressed e.g. in cells of the intestinal barrier, IB, and, to an even higher extent, in the endothelial cells of the blood vessels in the brain, constituting the blood- brain barrier, BBB. Various cancer cells also express high levels of Pgp. Cells, which exhibit the multidrug resistance phenotype can over-express Pgp and other efflux transporters after exposure to a single chemical agent (e.g. a drug or a food component). As a result, these cells become resistant to the se - lective agent and cross-resistant to a broad spec - trum of structurally and functionally dissimilar drugs. Most well characterized transporters, such as pep - tide or sugar transporters move either just one sub - strate or a single class of substrates across the membrane whereby, substrate binding and release occurs in the aqueous phase. Pgp significantly dif - fers by taking care of a broad range of chemically diverse substrates whereby substrate binding and release takes place in the lipid phase. This has sig - nificant consequences for the thermodynamics and kinetics of substrate-transporter interactions (Seelig & Gatlik-Landwojtowicz, 2005). Direct measurement of substrate-transporter recognition in the lipid phase has not yet been possible. Visualization of substrate- transporter complexes by means of X-ray crystallog - raphy must be considered with great caution since the essential element for Pgp activity, the lipid mem - brane, is missing. In comparison to the aqueous milieu, the anisotropic lipid environment changes many physical-chemical parameters. Among others, it partially or totally strips off the hydration shell of the partitioning molecule, induces preferential molecular orientation, stabilizes secondary structural elements such as a-helix and -sheet, in the case of peptides, and increases the rate of translational diffusion and thus the rate of ap - proach to the protein target. It also enhances electro - static interactions, including H-bonding interactions, due to its lower dielectric constant. Membrane-medi - ated processes have been discussed in the field of substrate- receptor interactions (Seelig et al. , 1996).

To contribute to the understanding of membrane-mediated substrate-Pgp interactions we asked the following questions: (i) How large is the contribution of the lipid membrane to substrate- transporter binding? (ii) How can a single transporter achieve recognition of so many chemically diverse substrates? (iii) Why are the rates of Pgp ATPase activity and the rates of apparent substrate transport not identical? How large is the contribution of the lipid mem - brane to substrate-transporter binding? Binding of a substrate from water to the activating binding region of P-glycoprotein occurs in two steps, a partitioning step from water to the lipid membrane, characterized by a lipid-water partition coefficient, Klw, and a binding step from the lipid membrane to the transporter, characterized by the transporter-lipid binding constant, Ktl. The transporter-water binding constant, Ktw, can thus be expressed as product of two individual binding constants Klw and Ktl. We selected 15 structurally diverse drugs and measured the binding constants from water to the activating binding region of P-glycoprotein, Ktw, as well as the lipid-water partition coefficients, Klw. The former were obtained by measuring the concentrations of half-maximum activation in living NIH-MDR-G185 mouse embryo fibroblasts using a Cytosensor microphysiometer and the latter were derived from surface activity measurements. This allowed determination of the membrane concentration of drugs at half-maximum P-glycoprotein activity ( Cb = (0.02 to 67) mmol/L lipid). The membrane concentration of drugs at half- maximum P-glycoprotein activity is thus greater by a factor of 102 to 104 than the corresponding aqueous concentration.On this basis the free energy of substrate-transporter binding in the lipid membrane could be determined (0 t lG = (-7 to -27) kJ/mol) (yellow arrow). The direct interactions between drugs and P- glycoprotein are thus, on the average, quite weak, which is typical for transporters but contrasted with general expectations. Despite the relatively weak Pgp-substrate interactions, cells expressing high levels of Pgp are well protected against intruding drugs or toxins, since the lipid membrane acts as a drug scavenger (Seelig & Gatlik-Landwojtowicz, 2005, Gatlik-Landwojtowicz et al, 2006). How can a single transporter achieve recognition of so many chemically diverse substrates? To address the most intriguing question as to the na - ture of the substrate-transporter interactions in the lipid membrane an educated guess is still required. Based on the analysis of hundreds of substrates, the minimal common element of Pgp substrates, was found to consist of a specific geometric pattern of two hydrogen bond acceptor groups (called type I and type II units) (Seelig, 1998) . We definied an intrinsic Pgp substrate as a com - pound that (i) is cationic or non-charged, (ii) is able to reach the inner cytosolic leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane, and (iii) carries minimally one type I or type II unit. A single compound can carry up to seven or more such patterns. The hydrogen bond acceptor pat - terns (type I and type II units) are likely to react with hydrogen bond donor groups, which are abun - dant in the putative transmembrane sequences of P-glycoprotein (Seelig et al., 2000). Since the free energies of binding from the lipid membrane to the transporter have been shown to differ considerably for the different substrates investigated (see above), substrate-transporter binding cannot be explained by a classical one-pharmacophore model. However, substrate-transporter binding can be well interpreted with a modular binding concept, where the biding- modules consist of hydrogen bond acceptor patterns (type I and type II units). The average free energy per hydrogen bond formed was determined as 0 HiG -4 kJ/mol, which is in agreement with ex - pectations (Gatlik-Landwojtowicz et al, 2006). The hydrogen bond acceptor hypothesis was further tested by Georg and her research group. They syn - thesized paclitaxel analogs with different numbers of hydrogen bond acceptor patterns and demonstrated that the affinity of the analogs to Pgp decreases with decreasing number of hydrogen bond acceptor pat - terns (Ge et al., 2006, Spletstoser et al., 2006).Anna Seelig 130 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Structural Biology & Biophysics What is the difference between an intrinsic and an apparent substrate for Pgp? Understanding and predicting transport of lipid-solu - ble substrates was a further challenge (Seelig & Gat - lik-Landwojtowicz, 2005). The intrinsic drug transport rate is directly proportional to the rate of ATP hydroly - sis or the turnover number of Pgp. However, intrinsic substrates are not necessarily identified in transport experiments across cell monolayers, nevertheless, they modulate drug absorption. The net influx, J, of a drug into the cell is the sum of the active efflux, - V, (Gatlik-Landwojtowicz et al, 2004) and the passive influx, (Gerebtzoff et al., 2004). Whether or not a compound is an apparent substrate thus depends on the relationship between passive in - flux and active efflux. The latter is proportional to the lipid-water partition coefficient, Klw, which depends on the cross-sectional area, AD, of the molecule and the lateral packing density, M, of the lipid bilayer (Gatlik- Landwojtowicz et al, 2006). Intrinsic substrates with large cross-sectional areas or high charge diffuse slowly and thus have a high chance to appear as apparent substrates. Small intrinsic substrates that diffuse more rapidly may appear as \"non-substrates\" since Pgp is unable to cope with their influx. Cer - tain compounds (e.g. verapamil) can appear as ap - parent substrates in cell lines with a high packing density, M, and as non-substrate in cell-lines with a lower packing density. This explains the numerous conflicting results in literature. We have developed a program for the prediction of the cross-sectional area, AD, of a drug (Gerebtzoff & Seelig, Submitted) and have determined the lateral packing density, M, of several model and biological membranes (Gatlik- Landwojtowicz et al, 2006) which allows calculation of whether or not a compound is an apparent sub - strate in a given system (cf.

It depends on the chemical nature of the lipids, peptides, and carbohydrates involved and also on the mechanistic nature of the processes investigated. Different rules apply for trans-membrane insertions than for half-sided em - bedding. Electrostatic coulombic attrac - tion / repulsion and dipolar interactions), hydrogen bond formation, and hydrophobic interactions play equally important roles. The enormous interest in \"lipid rafts\" has sensitized the scientific community to realize that the lipid part of the membrane is not simply a homogenous grease but comprises an enormous variety of lipid molecules of hitherto un - known functions. Depending on the membrane com - position, groups of specific lipids may aggregate into patches with physical properties distinctly different from those of other membrane domains. The inter - action of a peptide with the lipid membrane can be divided into three steps. (i) Binding is initiated by the electrostatic attraction of a usually cationic peptide to the anionic membrane. (ii) The next step is the transition of the peptide into the plane of binding which is followed by (iii) a conformational change of the peptide in the new environment (most often a transition to a partially a-helical structure). The second topic of our research is in vivo magnetic resonance. In vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides anatomic images of living systems. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) goes one step further and provides insight into brain ac - tivity. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) de - tects the metabolic processes in well-defined spatial areas of the living animal without the use of invasive methods. Thermodynamics of lipid-peptide interactions This review is focused on peptide molecules which exhibit a limited solubility in the aqueous phase and bind to the lipid membrane from the aqueous me - dium. Surface adsorption, membrane insertion, and specific binding are usually accompanied by changes in the heat content of the system and can be meas - ured conveniently with isothermal titration calorim - etry, avoiding the necessity of peptide labeling. The driving forces for peptide adsorption and binding are hydrophobicity, electrostatics, and hydrogen bond - ing. An exclusively hydrophobic interaction is exem - plified by the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine A. Its insertion into the membrane can be described by a simple partition equilibrium Xb=K0Ceq. If peptide and membrane are both charged, electrostatic inter - actions are dominant leading to nonlinear binding Membrane interactions and in vivo magnetic resonance Joachim Seelig Phone +41 61 267 22 06 Fax +41 61 267 21 89 joachim.seelig@unibas.ch www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/jseelig Assistant Notz 132 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Structural Biology & Biophysics curves. The concentration of the peptide near the membrane interface can then be much larger than its bulk concentration. Electrostatic effects must be accounted for by means of the Gouy-Chapman theory before conventional binding models can be applied. A small number of peptides and proteins bind with very high affinity to a specific lipid species only. This is illustrated for the antibiotic cinnamycin (Ro 09-0198) which forms a 1:1 complex with phos - phatidyethanolamine with a binding constant of 108 M-1. Membrane adsorption and insertion can be ac - companied by conformational transitions facilitated, in part, by hydrogen bonding mechanisms. The two membrane-induced conformational changes to be discussed are the random coil-to- a-helix transition of amphipathic peptides and the random coil-to- - structure transition of Alzheimer peptides. (Seelig 2004) Interaction of the Protein Transduction Domain of HIV-1 TAT with Heparan Sulfate: Binding Mecha - nism and Thermodynamic Parameters The positively charged protein transduction domain of the HIV-1 TAT protein (TAT-PTD; residues 47-57 of TAT) rapidly translocates across the plasma mem - brane of living cells. This property is exploited for the delivery of proteins, drugs and genes into cells. The mechanism of this translocation is, however, not yet understood. Recent theories for translocation sug - gest binding of the PTD to extracellular glycosamino - glycans as a possible mechanism. We have studied the binding equilibrium between TAT-PTD and three different glycosaminoglycans with high sensitivity isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and provide the first quantitative thermodynamic description. The polysulfonated macromolecules were found to ex - hibit multiple identical binding sites for TAT-PTD with only small differences between the three species as far as the thermodynamic parameters are concerned. Heparan sulfate (HS, MW 14.2 \u00b1 2 kDa) has 6.3 \u00b1 1.0 independent binding sites for TAT-PTD which are characterized by a binding constant K0 = (6.0 \u00b1 0.6) \u00b7 105 M-1 and a reaction enthalpy 0 pepH = -4.6 \u00b1 kcal/mol at 28\u00b0C. binding affinity, 0 pepG , is de - termined to an equal extent by enthalpic and entro - pic contributions. The HS-TAT-PTD complex forma - tion entails a positive heat capacity change of 0 pC = + 135 cal/mole peptide which is characteristic of a charge neutralization reaction. This is in contrast to hydrophobic binding reactions which display a large negative heat capacity changes. The stoichiometry of 6-7 TAT-PTD molecules per HS corresponds to an electric charge neutralization. Light scattering data demonstrate a maximum scattering intensity at this stoichiometric ratio, the intensity of which depends on the order of mixing of the two components. The data suggest crosslinking and/or aggregation of HS-TAT-PTD complexes. Two other glycosamino - glycans, namely heparin and chondroitin sulfate B, were also studied with ITC. The thermodynamic pa - rameters are K0 = (6.0 \u00b1 0.8) \u00b7 105 M-1 0 = -5.1 0.7 kcal/mol for and K0 (2.5 \u00b7 M-1 0 = -3.2 \u00b1 0.4 kcal/mol for - droitin sulfate B at 28\u00b0C. The close thermodynamic similarity of the three binding molecules implies also a close structural relationship. The ubiquitous occur - rence of glycosaminoglycans on the cell surface to - gether with their tight and rapid interaction with the TAT protein transduction domain makes complex formation a strong candidate as the primary step of protein translocation. (Ziegler and Seelig 2004) The Cationic Cell-Penetrating Peptide CPPTAT Derived from the HIV-1 Protein TAT Is Rapidly Transported into Living Fibroblasts: Optical, Bio - physical, and Metabolic Evidence Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are cationic pep - tides which, when linked to genes, proteins, or na - noparticles, facilitate the transport of these entities across the cell membrane. Despite their potential use for gene transfer and drug delivery, the mode of action of CPPs is still mysterious. It has even been argued that the observed transport across the cell membrane is an artifact caused by chemical fixation of the cells, a common preparation method for mi - croscopic observation. Here we have synthesized a fluorescent derivative of the HIV-1 TAT protein transduction domain [Fg-CPPTAT(PTD)] and have observed its uptake into nonfixated living fibroblasts with time-lapse confocal microscopy, eliminating the need for fixation. We observe that Fg-CPPTAT(PTD) en- ters the cytoplasm and nucleus of nonfixated fibrob - lasts within seconds, arguing against the suggested artifact of cell fixation. Using differential interference contrast microscopy, dense aggregates are detected on the cell surface. Several observations suggest that these aggregates consist of Fg-CPPTAT(PTD) bound to membrane-associated heparan sulfate (HS). The aggregates grow in parallel with Fg-CPPTAT(PTD) up- take and are detected only on fibroblasts showing Fg-CPPTAT(PTD) uptake. These observations resemble earlier reports of \"capping\" of cell surface molecules combined with a polarized endocytotic flow. Enzy - matic removal of extracellular HS reduced the rate of both Fg-CPPTAT(PTD) uptake and aggregate forma - tion, demonstrating that HS is involved in the uptake mechanism. The functionality of the fibroblasts dur - ing the CPP uptake was investigated with a cytosen -Joachim Seelig133 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005Structural Biology & Biophysics sor microphysiometer measuring the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Short exposures (2.5 min) to the CPP reduced the ECAR which was, however, reversible upon reperfusion with buffer only. In con - trast, no recovery to baseline values was observed after repeated exposures to the CPP, suggesting that the CPP is toxic in long-term applications. (Zie - gler et al. 2005) Binding of Oligoarginine to Membrane Lipids and Heparan Sulfate: Structural of a peptides (CPPs) comprise a group of arginine-rich oligopeptides that are able to deliver exogenous cargo into cells. A first step in the internalization of CPPs is their binding to the cell surface, a reaction likely to involve membrane phospholipids and/or heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). The present work characterizes the inter - action of R9, one of the most efficient CPPs, with ei - ther heparan sulfate (HS) to HS with high affin - ity. Assuming that HS has n independent and equiv - alent binding sites for R9, we find an association con - stant of 3.1 \u00d7 106 M-1 at 28\u00b0C. At this temperature, the reaction is 0 pepH = -5.5 kcal/mol and ~7 R9 molecules bind per chain, which is equiv - alent to ~0.95 cationic/anionic charge ratio. 0 pepH decreases in magnitude upon an increase in temper - ature, and the reaction becomes entropy-driven at higher temperatures ( 37\u00b0C). The positive heat-ca - pacity change entailed by this reaction (0 pC= +167 cal mol-1 K-1) indicates the loss of polar residues on R9-HS binding, suggesting that hydrophobic forces play no major role on binding. Calorimetric analysis of the interaction of R9 with POPC/POPG (75:25) vesicles reveals an association constant of 8.2 \u00d7 104 M-1 at 28\u00b0C. Using a surface partition equilibrium model to correct for electrostatic effects, we find an intrinsic partition constant of ~900 M-1, a value that is also confirmed by electrophoretic mobility measure - ments. This corresponds to an electrostatic contribu - tion of ~33% to the total free energy of binding. Deu - terium nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shows no change in the headgroup conformation of POPC and POPG, suggesting that binding takes place at some distance from the plane of the polar groups. 31P NMR indicates that the lipid bilayer remains intact upon R9 binding. The fact that R9 binds with greater affinity to HS than to anionic lipid vesicles makes the former molecule a more likely target in binding this CPP to the cell surface. (Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2005) Structural and Thermodynamic Aspects of the Interaction between Heparan Sulfate and Ana - logues of Melittin Melittin is an amphipathic cationic honeybee venom with well-known cytolytic and antimicrobial properties. When coupled to cationic polymers or lipid molecules, it forms conjugates with high transfection efficiency and low toxicity with promising applications in gene therapy. A first step in the internalization of melittin and its con - jugates is their binding to the cell surface, a reac - tion likely to involve heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). In the present work, we characterize the binding equilibrium of heparan sulfate (HS) with two melittin [Cys1]melittin (ri-mel-SH). these peptides replaces the N-ter - minal glycine present in native melittin, and allows binding to other molecules. Isothermal titra - tion calorimetry (ITC) reveals a high affinity of each melittin analog to HS. Association constants of 4.7 \u00d7 104 M-1 and 3.5 \u00d7 105 M-1 are found at physiologi - cal ionic strength and 15 oC for ri-mel-SH and mel- SH, respectively. The reaction enthalpy measured under these conditions is mol/kcal2.4 Ho pep= for and ri-mel-SH and ~14 for mel-SH under the same conditions. Tem - perature dependence studies using ri-mel-SH (mel- SH) show that o pepH decreases in magnitude upon increase in temperature, which results in a molar heat capacity of 11 o pep K molcal322 C- --= (-45 cal mol-1K-1). Such a negative heat capacity change is not expected for a purely electrostatic interaction and indicates that hydrophobic and other interactions are also involved in the binding equilibrium. Salt depen - dence studies of the binding constants confirm that non-electrostatic forces are an important component of the HS-melittin interaction. Binding to HS induces conformational changes in both peptides, with ri-mel- SH showing a 6-fold increase of the a-helix content when incubated with HS under saturation conditions.

Despite the importance of these biochemi - cal applications, relatively little is known about the interactions of cyclodextrins with phospholipid mem - branes. Here we characterize the binding of random - ly methylated -cyclodextrin (m CD) to 1-palmitoyl- calorimetry. Existing models of lipophilemembrane interactions are inadequate to describe the observed binding; we introduce a modified chemical reaction model in which the chemical activity of the phosphol - ipid is independent of its concentration. We find that an average of four m CD molecules bind to each POPC molecule with an enthalpy of reaction of 46 kJ mol-1 and an equilibrium constant of 90 M-3. These results are consistent with earlier qualitative obser - vations and suggest that disruption of phospholipid membranes may be minimized if the concentration of mCD is kept below about 15 mM. (Anderson et al. 2004) Structural properties of perfluorinated linear alkanes: a 19F and 13C NMR - rononane Liquid perfluorocarbons exhibit unique physical- chemical characteristics such as extraordinary stabil - ity, combined hydrophobia and lipophobia, low sur - face tension and a capacity to carry large quantities of gas. They have found widespread use in industry, medicine and biology even though the molecular ori - gin of these properties is not fully understood. The objective of the present work was to elucidate the physical behavior of perfluorinated linear alkanes by investigating their intramolecular electronic environ - ment using 13C and 19F NMR techniques in com - bination with theoretical calculations of molecular orbitals. Particular advantage was taken of 19F-19F through-space couplings, which led us to propose a molecular model in which delocalized p-electrons of the fluorines cover the entire surface of the mole - cule in two pairs of intertwined helices. Experimental data are presented for n-perfluorononane and sup - ported by corresponding measurements with shorter and longer perfluorinated alkanes.

Recent estimations predict that about 50% of all eukaryotic proteins can be alternatively spliced. Several lines of evidence suggest that alternative mRNA splicing results in small changes in protein structure and is likely to fine-tune the function and specificity of the affected protein. However, the knowledge of how alternative splicing regulates cel - lular processes on the molecular level is still limited. Agrin is a multidomain heparansulfate proteoglycan best known for its function to induce and maintain postsynaptic specializations at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). The agrin gene undergoes alterna - tive mRNA splicing at several sites which results in several protein isoforms that differ in expression and function. Alternative usage of exons at the 5' end of the gene results in two different ways of attachment to cellular structures. Two additional splice sites are located in the C-ter - minal domains G2 and G3, respectively. The four amino acid insert in G2, called A in chicken and y in rodents, encodes a heparin binding site. This insert is included in agrin transcripts expressed in neurons and glial cells while non-neuronal cells in the periph - ery, such as muscle, Schwann and kidney cells, lack this insert. The second splice site, called B in chick - en and z in rodents, results in proteins with 8, 11 or 19 (8 + 11) amino acid inserts in the G3 domain, which is essential for AChR aggregation in vitro and the formation of functional NMJs in vivo. The recent determination of the structures encoding G3-B0, G3- B8 and G3-B11 has helped to elucidate the structural basis underlying these functional differences. The B splice insert is flanked by several loops, which form a surface corresponding to the molecular recognition interface in the family of LNS proteins. NMR relax - ation data show that this surface in all G3 domains is subject to dynamic flexibility on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. Beside a remarkable struc - tural similarity to the immunoglobulin fold, the plas - ticity of this interaction interface is similar to that of hypervariable loop regions in antibodies (CDR`s). This might enable agrin for selective discrimination between different binding partners through induced fit mechanisms.

The integrated network formed by these three filament types is re - sponsible for the mechanical integrity of the cell and is critically involved in its division, motility and plas - ticity. The structural principles of IFs are still far from being fully understood [see e.g. Strelkov, Herrmann and Aebi (2003) Bioessays, 25, 243-251]. Howev - er, the knowledge of the IF molecular architecture is essential for the understanding of the structural mechanism of human diseases (cardiomyopathies, laminopathies, skin, neuronal diseases and many others) that have been linked to mutations in IF proteins. Few years ago, we have pioneered the use of X-ray crystallography towards studying the atomic structure of an IF protein vimentin [Strelkov et al. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. et al. (2002) EMBO J. 21, 1255-1266]. In addition, we employ further structural biology techniques such as electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and solution small-angle X-ray scattering [Strelkov et al. (2004) Meth. Cell Biol.]. Head-to-tail assembly of lamin dimers The nuclear IF proteins lamins assemble together with several proteins on the inner nuclear membrane into a filamentous scaffold called the nuclear lam - ina. In man, three types of lamins with significant sequence identity are expressed. The first assembly step of lamins is a head-to-tail association of dimers (as opposed to vimentin where a A11-type lateral tetramer is formed first). Towards obtaining the mo - lecular detail of this interaction, in collaboration with PD Dr. H. Herrmann (DKFZ Heidelberg), we have prepared N- and C-terminal lamin rod fragments as well as a further series of fragments of variable size, including those of human lamins A, B1 and B2. Re - combinant expression in E.coli and a His-tag based purification is being used to obtain mg quantities necessary for extensive crystallisation screening. Recently, we have solved the crystal structure of the coiled-coil dimer from the second half of coil 2 from human lamin A at 2.2\u00c5 resolution [Strelkov et al. (2004) J. Mol. Biol.]. Comparison to the crystal structure of the homologous segment of human vi - mentin reveals a similar overall structure but a differ - ent distribution of charged residues and a different pattern of intra- and interhelical salt bridges. These features may explain, at least in part, the differences observed between the lamin and vimentin assem - bly pathways. Employing a modeled A coil 1A dimer, we propose that the head-to-tail lamin dimers involves strong electrostatic at -Intermediate filaments: from molecular structure to understanding human disease Sergei V.

Moreover, lamin A mutations, includ - ing several ones in coil 2B, have been associated with human laminopathies. Based on our data most of these mutations are unlikely to alter the structure of the dimer but may affect essential molecular inter - actions occurring in later stages of filament assembly and lamina formation. In addition, we have explored the conditions under which pairs of N- and C-termi - nal fragments form stable complexes using analytical ultracentrifugation [Schumacher et al. (2006)]. The obtained complexes are being screened for crystalli - sation. Molecular basis of desmin myopathy We are investigating the structural effect of several disease-related mutations in desmin, a muscle-spe - cific IF protein [Bar et al . (2004) J. Struct. Biol.]. In par - ticular, deletions of residues 359-361 and 366 within coiled-coil segment 2B were associated with severe cardio- and myopathy. Using molecular modeling we have shown that both deletions cause a local change in the coiled-coil twisting, which however has a drastic effect on the dimer structure [Kaminska et al. (2004) Human Genetics]. As the result, dimer-dimer interac - tions are altered, leading to abnormalities in the fila - ment structure and ultimately causing the disease. To provide experimental proof for our findings, we work towards determining the crystal structures of desmin fragments carrying such mutations. A synthetic peptide corresponding to desmin segment containing deletion at position 366 as well as further recombinant desmin fragments carrying point mutations L345P, A360P, L370P, L385P and E401S were prepared. Extensive crystallisation screening with these desmin fragments is being done using nanolitre-scale robotic facilities at the University of Zurich and EMBL Hamburg. In addi - tion, our collaborators Dr. Harald Bar (DKFZ Heidel - berg) and Dr. Laurent Kreplak (Biozentrum) are using electron and atomic force microscopies to investigate the assembly of the full-length desmin with the corre - sponding mutations. These efforts are complementary to the crystallographic studies and computer model - ling. Structure and assembly of complete IFs IF assembly can be initiated in vitro by increasing the ionic strength or lowering of pH. Recently, we were first to use small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to in - vestigate the in vitro assembly of the wild-type human IF protein vimentin and its elongation-deficient mutant K139C by systematically varying the pH and ionic strength conditions, and complemented these experi - ments by electron microscopy and - trifugation [Sokolova et al. (2006)]. The SAXS data collection using synchrotron radiation was carried out at the EMBL Outstation in Hamburg. While vimentin solution in 5mM Tris-HCl (pH8.4) yields predominantly tetramers, we show that further lateral assembly in - duced by NaCl addition leads to formation of a dis - tinct octameric intermediate, and octamers eventually associate into the unit-length filament (ULF). Based on the SAXS experiments supplemented by crystallo - graphic data and additional structural constraints, first ever three-dimensional molecular models of vimentin tetramer, octamer and the ULF are constructed. This structural information is discussed in the context of IF assembly in vivo. As the next step, we plan to expand our small-angle scattering studies of the filament as - sembly process to further IF proteins such as desmin and its disease-related mutants. The right-handed coiled coil of the VASP tetram - erisation domain Apart from IFs, our research interests include the structural principles of -helical coiled coils. In particu - lar, the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is a key regulator of actin dynamics. In collaboration with the group of Prof. A. Wittinghofer (MPI Dortmund, Germany) we have determined the 1.3 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of the 45-residue long tetramerization domain (TD) from human VASP [Kuhnel et al (2004) PNAS]. By using our computer program Twister [Strel - kov and Burkhard (2002) J. Struct. Biol. 137, 54-64] we demonstrate that this domain forms a right-handed -helical coiled-coil structure with a similar degree of supercoiling as found in the widespread left-handed coiled coils with heptad repeats. The basis for the right-handed geometry of VASP TD is a 15-residue repeat in its amino acid sequence, which reveals a characteristic pattern of hydrophobic residues. Hy - drophobic interactions and a network of salt bridges render VASP TD highly thermostable with a melting point of 120\u00b0C. Comparison of the VASP TD with other structures containing heptad and 11-residue repeats sheds light on the general principles of the coiled-coil formation. Sergei V.

Strelkov140 Biozentrum, University of Basel Biennial Report 2004-2005The Life Sciences Training Facility provides a GeneChip system, Q-PCR and bioinformatics tools for quantative DNA and RNA analysis High Density Oligonucleotide Microarrays (Gene Chips) have become a major tool in basic and ap - plied biomedical research (http://www.affymetrix. com/). GeneChips enable scientists to study DNA mutations (SNP-Chips), RNA concentrations (Ex - pression profiling arrays) and genome-wide protein- DNA interactions (ChIP-Chip). The Life Sciences Training Facility (LSTF) provides free access to the Affymetrix 7G GeneChip scanner 3000 system, capable of scanning the newest gener - ation of GeneChips. This includes all-exon and tiling arrays that cover the complete genome sequences of human and mouse. The LSTF trains users in total RNA preparation, cDNA/cRNA target synthesis and quality control as well as microarray hybridisation and scanning. A Corbett RG 3000A system is op - erational and allows sophisticated quantitative PCR approaches to studying RNA concentrations and/or validating microarray data. To facilitate and accelerate annotation of high- throughput expression profiling experiments, the Microarray Information Management and Annotation System (MIMAS) was developed. It provides life sci - entists with a highly flexible and focused GeneChip data storage and annotation platform, essential for subsequent analysis and interpretation of the experi - mental results with clustering and mining tools. The system is accessible to registered users, who work at a research institute that is a member of the Swiss Array Consortium (SAC) at http://www.mimas.uni bas.ch/. Furthermore, a free array data storage solu - tion is offered via the Basel Computational Biology Center [BC]2 (http://www.bc2.ch). To further support users of the LSTF, microarray data analysis training courses focussing on commercially available soft - ware solutions are offered. Finally, training courses covering open source packages (CTWC, http://ctwc. bioz.unibas.ch/; ExpressionProfiler, http://ep.ebi. ac.uk/EP/) are laboratories of E.

In addition to an LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer used as a work - horse for daily analytical routine, Finnigan's newest mass spectrometry development, the LTQ-Orbitrap, has been taken into operation. In proteomics analy - sis, safe identification of proteins in ever more com - plex mixtures has become a necessity to help to un - derstand fundamental biological phenomena, such as the construction of protein-protein networks and signaling pathways involved in pathological and de - velopmental processes. Instrumentation that maxi - mize confident protein identifications in combination with computational resources are therefore highly desirable. The LTQ Orbitrap is a newly developed hybrid mass spectrometer with two analyzers, a linear ion trap and an Orbitrap. Both ion traps have high ion stor - age capacities as well as high scan rates and MS/ MS sensitivities. The Orbitrap achieves excellent mass resolution and mass accuracy in full MS and MS/MS modes of operation. The resolution in an Orbitrap analysis depends on the acquisition time of an ion. For a resolution of 7,500, the ion is detected for about 90 ms, whereas a reso - lution of 60,000 requires a detection time of 750 ms. There are various scanning modes that can be cho - sen depending on the needs of the experiment. For example, while the Orbitrap measures the mass of a precursor ion accurately, the LTQ ion trap acquires several MS/MS scans concurrent to the acquisition of a high resolution MS spectrum in a fully automated data dependent manner. On the other hand, for pro - tein digests of average complexity, both, precursors and fragment ions can be measured in the Orbitrap analyzer, yielding accurate mass information of both, precursors and fragment ions. In addition to using the instrument routinely for pro - tein identifications, we have successfully identified potential protein substrates for the yeast Npr1p ki - nase. A protein library that had been generated from chemically digesting extracts of yeast cells was not only successfully identified, but also, the site of the in vitro phosphorylated candidate substrate was been identified, despite the low abundance of the sub - strate in a very complex mixture of proteins.Proteomics Paul Jen\u00f6 Phone +41 61 267 21 56 Fax +41 61 267 21 48 paul.jenoe@unibas.ch www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/jenoe Group Member Patrick Altermatt, Stefan Gander, Suzette Moes In Collaboration with W.
