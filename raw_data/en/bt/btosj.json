George Orwell, in Politics and the English Language, famously drew our attention to the ways in which we were in danger of drainingmeaning from language\u2014and from there it's avery short step to draining meaning from life itself.As he wrote, \"The slovenliness of our languagemakes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts....Orthodoxy, of whatever color, seems to demand alifeless, imitative style,\" and, \"If thought corruptslanguage, language can also corrupt thought.\" When we use \"Waldorf\" in a way that creates insiders\u2014those who we believe know what wemean, and who agree with us\u2014and outsiders\u2014those who aren't in the know\u2014we undermine ourmeaning, our connection to others, and our rela-tionship to the world in which we live and teachbefore we have said anything further. We create,inhabit, and perpetuate a jargon that simplyworks against whatever good we hope to do in theworld. On the other hand, associated with the word \"Waldorf\" as it pertains to education, deep wellsof meaning await anyone with a bucket and arope long enough to reach them. By comparingthe words that Rudolf Steiner spoke to the teach-ers of the first Waldorf School in Stuttgart duringthe last six years of his life with the life of theschool during this time, Christof Wiechert, in thisissue of the Bulletin, creates a historical context of meaning in which we can understand Steiner'swords with greater clarity. As Steiner and the firstWaldorf school teachers wrestled with bringingthe school to being, they confronted realities ofschool life that are still true for us today. Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1Martyn Rawson connects teacher self- education and the work of groups of teachers (faculty, college, or council) in Waldorf schoolswith Steiner's contemplative or meditativeresearch method and with the work of ArthurZajonc and others who currently see the value\u2014ifnot the necessity\u2014of reflection in educationalresearch. Marisha Plotnik offers her understanding, based on years of experience and study, of \"childstudy\" in Waldorf schools, one area in which acontemplative method is consistently used.Plotnik, too, connects her study with the work ofeducational researchers outside of Waldorf educa-tion and with work she has done with JonMcAlice and other teachers. We may believe that \"Waldorf\" doesn't com- bine grades or ages, but Lori Freer demonstratesnot only that schools are doing just this\u2014oftenout of economic necessity\u2014but that this need notbe the compromise we may assume it to be. Thereare advantages and strengths to mixed-age class-rooms, and we may investigate, work toward,and emphasize these when life hands us a schoolor a class of mixed-age students. Similarly, we may believe that \"Waldorf\" doesn't acknowledge or single out gifted studentsfor special programs, but Ellen Fjeld K\u00f8ttker andBalazs Tarnai connect Steiner's work with giftedstudents in the first Waldorf School with researchand programming for gifted students over thepast decades. One area in which Waldorf schools have per- haps had an advantage over the past decades isin what is now called Social Emotional Learning(SEL), illustrated here in Linda Lantieri's articleabout SEL in a public school district and a publicschool. Lantieri is an international expert in SEL.Waldorf school teachers may learn from Lantieri'sapproach and may also refer to David Mitchell'sarticle in the last issue of the Bulletin(\"Social Emotional Learning and Waldorf Education,\" Vol.XIV, no. 2, Autumn 2009), which examines SELfrom a Waldorf teacher's perspective and offersOFrom the Editor Stephen Keith Sagarin 4 \u00b7 From the Editor Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1an SEL curriculum outline for middle and high school years. In Susan Johnson's brief but informative arti- cle, readers will find connections among medicalscience and education in support of teaching chil-dren to read and write only when they are physio-logically and neurologically ready to do so. This isnot an issue of \"Waldorf\" or \"not-Waldorf,\" but ofchildren's health in a world that too easily\u2014andirrationally\u2014succumbs to political pressure andperformance anxiety in considering the educationof its children. Regular readers will note that the Bulletinusu- ally contains more in the way of research, book,and conference reviews and reports. Travel sched-ules, challenges with translation, time crunches,and re-writes conspired to make this issue article-heavy and report-light. Our next issue should seea return to a better balance among contents. Other than our usual report from Marianne Alsop, the cheerful yeo-woman of the OnlineWaldorf Library, we present Martin Novom andJean Jeager's results of a brief survey of Waldorfschool trustees. Their research demonstrates thegreat commitment of trustee volunteers across thecountry and also the great lack of thorough, con-sistent trustee education. Waldorf schools mayrecognize this research as a platform on which tobuild stronger trustee orientation and education,honing trustees' tremendous idealism and willing-ness to improve their schools. If we take our work seriously and think it through, we can speak about it without jargonand without abusing the over-worked word,\"Waldorf.\" Our concepts will become ever clearer,our practices less opaque. We will find a world offriendly fellow-travelers, ready to work with us onthe daunting task of educating children well in acomplex world too often divided by a lack ofunderstanding. Correction In our last issue, Thomas Patteson and Laura Birdsall's article, \"Changing Old Habits: ExploringNew Models for Professional Development\" (Vol.XIV, no. 2, Autumn 2009), referred to charts thathad, in fact, been removed in editing. We apolo-gize to those readers who sought the charts invain, and we regret neglecting to remove referenceto them.Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1new round of publications and surveys tops the agenda of activity at the Research Institute for Waldorf Education, including the pro-duction of a new format for rare books and arti-cles. ElectronicBooks An exciting new venture launched by the ResearchInstitute for Waldorf Education is the publicationof Electronic Books. These \"E-books\" are posted onthe website of our Online Waldorf Library (OWL)\u2014www.waldorflibrary.org--and can be down-loaded gratis anywhere in the world. They arealso available on disks. The goal of this project, sponsored by the Waldorf Curriculum Fund, is to locate out-of-printresources, gain permission from the original pub-lishers, and create Adobe pdf files. In this way,educational insights inspired by Rudolf Steiner aremade available to anyone around the globe. So far, two CD-ROMs have been produced: E-Books disk #1, 2008, contains: Science in Education (essays from Child and Man) The Gospel of Hellas by Friedrich Hiebel Handwork by Hedwig Hauck E-Books and Writing by Karl K\u00f6nig Arithmetic (with references to Zoology) by Karl K\u00f6nig Embryology and World Evolution by Karl K\u00f6nig Creating Social Sacraments by Dieter Br\u00fcll Plans are underway for at least ten more disks, each with three or more books. We invite our read-ers to write to us at the Research Institute withsuggested titles of books and articles no longer inprint. ParentsSurvey We are also working on a survey of Waldorf par-ents initiated by Martin Novom. Results of thiswork, currently undergoing statistical review andpeer analysis, should be available later this year.We intend to print excerpts in the next issue of theResearch Bulletin. SexEducation Under the guidance of Douglas Gerwin, theResearch Institute is developing a source book ona Waldorf educational approach to sexual educa-tion in grades 4-12. Working with colleagues inSwitzerland and Germany, we are currently trans-lating portions of Bart Maris and Michael Zech'sbook,Sexualkunde in der Waldorfp\u00e4dagogik (The Study of Sexuality in Waldorf Education). In addi-tion, we are commissioning prominent Waldorfeducators in North America to prepare additionalchapters and have begun conducting researchamong schools to gather curriculum suggestions.It is our hope that this research will yield new andmorally grounded material and that such a cur-riculum can extend beyond Waldorf educationinto the mainstream. TeachingSensibleScience A new cycle of the ever-popular course on\"Teaching Sensible Science,\" a series of three one-week intensives in a phenomenological approachto science for Waldorf school class teachers, hadto be postponed because participants were unableto secure sufficient financial support. We expectthat this course, which has received high praisefrom those teachers who have taken it over theyears, will start up again in the next season.Schools interested in hosting this course duringthe next school year are invited to contact theResearch Institute. EuropeanCollaboration We continue to find new ways of collaboratingwith colleagues in Europe, but, unfortunately,funding for these initiatives has dried up. For thisyear, at least, we are limited to meeting only once Report from the Co-Directors David Mitchell and Douglas Gerwin Awith these colleagues to continue dialogue and to enhance research with a European perspective.We hope that this important collaboration will befully restored in the future. FundingNeeds General decline worldwide of funding for researchhas caught up with the Research Institute. As aresult, we find ourselves having to devoteincreased attention to securing fiscal support tomeet the operating costs of the Institute ratherthan exploring new areas of educational research.While we are fortunate to have several generouslyfunded projects in process and the prospect ofsome new ones, we need to concentrate energy6 \u00b7 Report from the Co-Directors Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1into creating an endowment so that we are notalways walking on the edge. To this end, we havedeveloped a legacy funding package to supportthe future of the Institute and have prepared sev-eral brochures explaining the benefits of theseforms of giving. We thank those who have con-tributed to the Institute's first annual giving cam-paign, based on the brochure included with thelast edition of the Research Bulletin, and we encour- age all of you opening this edition to make adonation. An envelope is provided for this pur-pose, and we urge you to pass the legacybrochure to anyone who might consider support-ing our efforts. Note:You will notice that this issue does not include the complete Index of past Research Bulletins. In order to economize we will include the Index only in the Autumn/Winter edition of theBulletin.Introduction The first years of the Stuttgart Waldorf School can be seen as prototypical of the development of Waldorf schools and Waldorf teachers in general.We can benefit today from the events that tookplace in the six years between 1919 and 1925,while the first school was led by Rudolf Steiner.Examining Steiner's work in the school can givedirection to the development of teachers andschools in the 21st century. Sources The lectures that Steiner gave to the teachers of the first Waldorf school are especially relevanthere. The majority of lectures on education weregiven to a general audience, with only a fewaddressing the same group of specialists, that is,the college of teachers of the first Waldorf school.In Steiner's day, this group initially consisted of 12colleagues; at the beginning of the sixth year ofthe school, the number had risen to 49. The fol-lowing lectures were given to this relatively smallgroup: 1.Study of Man (later published as The Foundations of Human Experience ),Practical Advice to Teachers, Discussions with Teachers (Stuttgart, 21 August-6 September 1919;CW 293, 294, 295) 2.Balance in Teaching (Stuttgart, September 1920; CW 302a) 3.Waldorf Education for Adolescents ( The Supplementary Course ) (Stuttgart, 12-19 June 1921; CW 302) 4.Adolescence\u2014Ripe 21- 22 June 1922; CW 302a) 5.Art in the Light of Mystery Wisdom (Two lec- tures, Stuttgart, 7 and 8 March 1923; CW283) 6.Deeper Insights into Education: The Waldorf Approach (Stuttgart, 15 and 16 October 1923; CW 302a)Two other important volumes complete the cate- gory: 7. The 70 teachers' conferences with Rudolf Steiner:Faculty Meetings with Rudolf Steiner (CW 300 a-c) 8.Rudolf Steiner in the Waldorf School: Lectures and Addresses to Children, Parents andTeachers. This includes addresses at monthlyschool festivals, seasonal festivals, and par-ents' evenings. StudyofMan:TheFirstYear After the opening address on the eve of the Teachers' Seminar, at which Steiner outlined theschool's administrative set-up few sentences(\"not bureaucratically, but collegially ... in arepublican way.... Each one of us must be com-pletely responsible. We can create a replacementfor the supervision of the School Board as weform this preparatory course and, through thework, receive what unifies the school\"), the firstlecture was presented the following morning. In this lecture, with simple words, the signifi- cance and depth of which can be grasped onlygradually, a link is established between a newform of education and human evolution. A con-nection is created to the spiritual world and toentities whose deepest concern is the developmentof human beings. Reference is made to the 15thcentury as the starting point of the developmentof which we experience the consequences today. The concentration of intelligence on purely worldly aspects, which was necessary for humanfreedom to unfold, gave rise not only to scienceand technology, but also to materialism and ego-ism. \"All of modern culture, right into the spiritualareas, is based upon human self-interest.\" Steinerpoints out that religions tend to focus on theafter-life while forgetting about the time beforebirth. It is a teacher's task to explore the lifebefore birth. \"Our form of educating can have thecorrect attitude only when we are aware that our Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1 What Can Rudolf Steiner's Words to the First Waldorf Teachers Tell Us Today? Christof Wiechert8 \u00b7 What Can Rudolf Steiner's Words to the First Waldorf School Teachers Tell Us Today? work with young people is a continuation of what higher beings have done before birth.\" How can this be achieved in practice? Think of a childstudy. The first step is theforming of a picture of thepupil as he or she appears inspace and time. In order tounderstand this picture wehave to go a step further. Howdid the pupil come to developin this way? It is easy to findout as long as we avoid thetemptation of superficial psychology. We come toan understanding of the inner essence of a pupil ifwe ask how etheric body and physical body, forinstance, relate to one another, or how the soul(astral) works on the \"learning body\" (ethericbody). How did spirit-soul (or soul-spirit) each other? What expresses itself inwhich way? We experience immediately, if wepractice this way of asking questions, how wemove in a realm of \"pure air\" where we can sensethe becoming and the essence of the humanbeing. Those of us who attempt this, when medi-tating on a pupil, for example, know from experi-ence that it works only if we manage not to putourselves in the foreground. We have to be open,without preconceptions; this \"not I, but the pupilin me\" approach will allow us to develop a sensefor pre-earthly intentions by observing the pupils. If we manage to take hold of these intentions as ideas, we will be able to fuse them into anideal. Pedagogical inspiration becomes possible,acting in harmony with what wants to come tolife. It arises out of interest in pre-earthly aspectsthat reveal themselves in the different parts of thehuman organization. Steiner gives evidence of thiscapacity in the course of more than a hundredchild studies. We easily forget that understanding the pupils' temperaments is also a way of overcoming\"cultural egotism,\" because temperament sayssomething about how life before birth weaves intolife after birth. When studying the pupils' tem-peraments, we have to withhold our own tem-peraments, and this allows us to build a bridge tothe student. Then the student will approach us. The last lecture of The Foundations of Human Experience (Study of Man) and of Discussions with Teachersdeals with the surprising significance of Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1images, of speaking in images, of keeping theintellectual flexible. The importance of imagina- tion is emphasized, especially onthe threshold of adolescence. The process culminates on 6 September with the presentationof the seven virtues of theteacher. The first three are foundat the end of the last lecture ofThe Foundations of HumanExperience (Study of Man): \"Imbue yourself with the power of imag-ination, have courage for the truth, sharpen your feeling for responsibility ofsoul.\" The remaining four are at the end ofDiscussions with Teachers: \"The teacher must be aman of initiative, a man of interest in the being ofthe whole world and of humanity, a man whonever makes a compromise in his heart and mindwith what is untrue (especially in the way wepresent our subjects), and he must never get staleor grow sour.\" The latter four virtues represent faculties of the temperaments; they are virtues that can beexercised in our daily work. Initiative: Shall I makethe phone call tonight or wait until tomorrow?Interest: These parents are foreign to me; can Istill summon up an interest in them? This col-league gets on my nerves, but that is interesting!This student walks in such a strange way, as if theground beneath him was hurting him. What doesthat indicate? Am I really interested in the lessonthat I have to present just now? Whether or not Ihave a strong interest in my subject matter affectsthe liveliness of my teaching and may lead to anunfortunate compromise: \"He must never compro-mise with untruth, for if he did so we should seehow through many channels untruth would findits way into our teaching, especially in the waywe present our subjects.\" This is a direct reference to teaching method, and many channels are open today through whichuntruth can creep into our teaching. Is it not muchmore practical to have an estab lished method for teaching a foreign language? Should I not simplyuse exercises from these excellent publications onbasic math, spelling, elementary physics? There areso many useful things. We could also call this thevirtue of faithfulness. I am faithful to a methodthat I shape in the truest possible way while con-stantly renewing it to keep my teaching alive.I am faithful to a method that I shapein the truest possibleway while constantlyrenewing it to keepmy teaching alive.Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1Christof Wiechert \u00b7 9 Every adult has some melancholy which, depending on her overall temperament, struggles with staleness and sourness to a greater or lesserdegree. From a certain age it is always lurkingaround the corner. Am I sufficiently aware of it?Observing one another's lessons is good prophy-laxis. Why do you work with the children in thisway? Asking is appropriate, judging is not. The first three virtues are of a different nature. They cannot be practiced in our day-to-day work. We all know from expe-rience: imagination, speaking inimages, being inspired\u2014this I can-not develop while standing infront of a class. If I am imagina-tive, it is as a result of differentprocesses. Acquiring knowledge of the human being in the three stagesdescribed elsewhere by Steiner isone path to imagination, life, andthe \"profound power of ingenuitythat you need when facing thechild you are to educate.\" Again and again, we are faced with the immensity of the opening words of The Foundations of Human Experience (Study of Man). They resound as from other worlds: My dear friends, we can accomplish our work only if we do not see it as simply amatter of intellect or feeling, but, in thehighest sense, as a moral spiritual task.Therefore, you will understand why, as webegin this work today, we first reflect onthe connection we wish to create from thevery beginning between our activity andthe spiritual worlds. We may ask ourselves whether or not the \"moral spiritual\" is the realm referred to as truthand responsibility in the first three virtues. For allthat is spiritual surely entails responsibility, allthat is moral surely is rooted in truth. We see agleam of the future of humankind; goodness,beauty, truth as in Goethe's \"Fairy Tale\" or as inChrist's words, \"I am the way, the truth, and thelife.\" \"Imbue yourself with the power of imagina-tion\" can be seen as \"the way\" in education,because Steiner once described education as a\"form of normal life.\"After presenting the latter four virtues in the closing words of the 15th discussion with teach-ers, Steiner adds, on a more personal note, \"Forme this Waldorf School will be a veritable child ofconcern.\" He exhorts the teachers to work togeth-er and to live in awareness of \"the spiritual pow-ers that guide the cosmos ... they will inspire ourlives.\" Shortly before the first Waldorf Schoolopened he asked the teachers to promise him tokeep this awareness alive. The classrooms were not yet ready when the school opened with afestive celebration on 7 September.Lessons therefore began on 16September, by which time Steiner hadleft for Berlin. During the first schoolyear Steiner had 14 meetings withthe teachers, and three more tookplace at the end of July 1920 inpreparation for the second schoolyear. The first school year startedwith 12 teachers, 8 classes, and 256students, which means that the aver-age class had 32 pupils, and there was one teacher for every 21 students. (Today theratio is closer to 1:10.) The second year startedwith 19 teachers, 11 classes, and 420 pupils,which means the average class had 38 pupils andthe teacher-pupil ratio was 1:22. These numbersalone may justify Steiner's expression, \"a child ofconcern.\" TheSecondYear Five days before the beginning of the second school year Steiner gave four lectures to theteachers, lectures which were intended as a sup-plement to the introductory lectures on educationgiven the previous year. Preparations for the sec-ond school year were so consuming, however, thathe doubted that he could manage more than\"scanty introductory words.\" He wanted to speak\"about the teacher, the educator\" and about \"thenature of the esoteric.\" The first lecture deals withthe \"condition of misery\" in the education of theyoung which had arisen due to the fact thathumankind \"in essential things really made itselfdependent ... on the kind of thinking and feelingpeculiar to West.\" Fichte, Herder, Goethe wereno longer understood. What Herder and Fichtewanted, an art of education, had been turned intothe opposite. Steiner offered examples of this viewSteiner tothe time,\" from lifeitself.10 \u00b7 What Can Rudolf Steiner's Words to the First Waldorf School Teachers Tell Us Today? and and concluded the lecture with the words, \"But with regard to what has to be given for the art ofeducation, we have something to give the worldfrom Central Europe which no one else can give.\"It hardly needs pointing out that he is not refer-ring to geography or nationalism, but to spiritualstreams. Was it necessary to refer these Waldorf School teachers to the way Western peoplethought and felt? Did they no longer understandGerman Idealism? Did they, of all people, need to be told in depth that their success aseducators depended on how muchthey themselves learned from theirteaching? Did they need to be remind-ed that \"inward humility\" grows outof the insight \"that the art of educa-tion must proceed from life and thatit cannot proceed from the \"Central European edu-cation impulse.\" References to it will\"annoy\" scientific thinkers. This was the situation after one year of Waldorf education. Reading this in 2010 orlater, we know that it is still and again the mainmotif in the art of education. Probably due to theexperiences of the first school year, Steiner urgentlypleaded for a \"new education appropriate to thetime,\" an art of education drawn from life itself.Today the phrase \"art of education\" still rufflesfeathers. What were the consequences? In these lectures Steiner did not return to the seven virtues of theteacher, but spoke of three fundamental forces inteaching. If we bear in mind that the quality of anorganism is determined by the sum total of forcesthat its members are able to summon, we may real-ize what Steiner achieved with lectures 2 and 3 ofBalance in Teaching. He spoke to the teachers aboutreverence, enthusiasm, and the protective gesture:reverence for what the child brings with him fromhis life before birth, for what determines his exis-tence, enthusiasm for what the pupil can becomein future with our help, and protectiveness toensure that the pedagogic reality in the here andnow remains appropriate to the child's age.What else did Steiner give the teachers with these few lectures? Next to the pedagogical contentshe conveyed to them two ways of transformingtheir teaching by filling it with life inspired by theCentral European spirit. He showed them how torealize their \"power of ingenuity,\" that is, their ped-agogical imagination and intuition. The first can bepracticed with the help of inner pictures; Steinercalled them meditative images. Intuition is practicedby following the \"digestive\" process that takes placeafter one has absorbed spiritual scientific contents. The \"vigorous power of ingenu- ity you need when facing the chil-dren you are educating\" is kindled ifwe develop mental images of howvisual and auditory perceptionrelate to one another in a crossing-over process; how the audible is per-ceived in the will (or memory) regionof the visible; how the visible isremembered in the perception regionof the audible; how these two princi-ples of time and space in fact formthe human body. Such pictures\u2014meditative images\u2014can also be derived fromthe second lecture by considering two streams: the sculptural and intellectual forcesthat come from the head (or use it as a locus oftransition) and the musical forces that stream infrom the outside world. The first of these forcesworks from the outside as attack and from theinside as defense. The latter, where the attackcomes as from inside, are attenuated by musicand speech instruction. Experience shows thatsuch images, if they are placed again and againbefore the inner eye, strongly inspire the day-to-day work of a teacher. The second important indication that Steiner gave to the teachers after one year of teachingreferred to the threefold approach to attainingknowledge of the human being: studying con-tents, coming to understand what has been stud-ied through meditation (calling up images againand again), \"and finally we have a rememberingof the knowledge of the human being out of thespirit. This means teaching creatively out of thespirit; the art of education comes about and takesform.\" Practical examples illustrate how our teaching works on the relationship between the \"I\" and the Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1The lectures are not just intellec-tually pleasing;Steiner, soul.Christof Wiechert \u00b7 11 Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1body. What seemed like an abstract request the year before (\"the task of education conceived in thespiritual sense is to bring the soul-spirit into harmo-ny with the life body\") is now explained in detail,how this harmonization of the upper and lowerhuman being proceeds: how the \"I\" settles in thebody without being \"caught\" in it. It all depends onhow elements of a sculptural, musical, and intellec-tual nature, and elements of memory and speech,alternate within a lesson. The impact of the varioussubjects is also explained, whether they help the \"I\"to \"settle\" or not. It is the ultimate description of anartistic approach to teaching. In summary we can say that Steiner obviously deemed it necessary in September 1920, after oneyear of Waldorf education, to confer with theteachers on an educational impulse that is drawnfrom life and not from science. The seven virtues of1919 were extended by the three forces that relateto the pupils' past, present, and future. On the basisof this he used higher considerations regarding thehuman being to point out two possible paths, oneof which is more inspirational (\"the vigorous powerof Steiner edu-cation how it \"regulates\" therelationship between the \"I\" and thebody, which we may consider theessential task of education. I suggestthat this was exactly what the teach-ers of the first Waldorf School need-ed after one year; it is what Steineridentified based on the experience ofthis first year. Are these qualities an inherent and identifying component of Waldorf school teach-ing today? Are they cultivated in the right way inteacher education and in faculty meetings? Have weunderstood that education has to be drawn fromlife, from the living experience of teaching, ratherthan from imposed parameters of whatever descrip-tion? These four lectures alone support what is said throughout the school movement, that, if Steinerhad to do it all over again, he would drasticallychange course and steer toward the artistic. Weneed not worry about the authenticity of this state-ment; it is the essence of these lectures.TheThirdYear Another year later, eight days before the begin- ning of the third school year, Steiner gave eightlectures to the teachers, later published as Waldorf Education for Adolescents. Unlike those published inBalance in Teaching, these lectures do not explicitlytie in with The Foundations of Human Experience (Study of Man). At the beginning of this school year, the school had almost doubled in size: 540pupils in 15 classes of approximately 36 studentsper class. The teacher-student ratio was 1:18.Steiner never complained about the rapid growthdespite the fact that financial problems were enor-mous. Can we assume that the lectures on the \"Meditatively Acquired Knowledge of the HumanBeing\" (that is, Balance in Teaching) had made an impact on the individual teachers? Steiner beganby looking back over the first two years and con-cluding, \"In order to prevent a possible misunder-standing of what I am going to say today, I canassure you that I have noticed and appreciatedthe progress made during these two years. The way you are teaching\u2014the presen-tation of subjects\u2014is already suchthat it can be said, you have, in anextraordinarily healthy way, fusedwith the goals of these tasks.\" Thisreport for the teachers soundsmuch like one we might writeabout our students at the end of aschool year. The eight lectures embrace rich content, always in keeping withPractical Advice to Teachers and with frequent excursions to the study of the human being. The sense of urgency that pre-vailed inBalance in Teaching abates. The connec- tion of memory and feeling, the work with chil-dren who have rich or poor imaginations, withcosmic and earthly children\u2014the teaching meth-ods are extended. This culminates in lecture 3, inwhich three essential steps of teaching areexplained, steps that are taken over a period oftwo\u2014not three\u2014days so that \"the three parts ofthe threefold human being can interact, they areallowed to harmonize in the right way.\" The lectures that deal with adolescence, with the diverging male and female constitution, returntoThe Foundations of Human Experience (Study of Steiner called this outwardagreement inconjunction withinner oppositionthe \"Stuttgartsystem.\"Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1applies to all lesson contents from the age when main lessons convey subject-matter as such. This isfollowed by an extended psychology of adoles-cence. We can imagine that the teachers were delight- ed by these eight lectures. Not only was the reviewof the first two years encouraging, the lectures alsoopened up an unclouded, wider horizon. TheFourthYear When I turn now to Steiner's conferences with teachers, it is with the inner conviction that it ishigh time that this treasure of 70 teachers' meetingsis published in a scientific edition in order to throwlight on the development of the art of education inpractice. The teachers were evidently not able to apply in practice the indications that Steiner gave in theSupplementary Course . At the end of the third school year, the students of the 10th grade asked for ameeting with Steiner. They complained about theirteachers, about the \"lecturing,\" about the teachers'lack of interest, about \"not having learned any-thing.\" Steiner looked into the situation and, basedon his findings, he arranged for a change of teach-ers for most of the main subjects, right at the begin-ning of the fourth school year, for these studentswho were now in 11th grade. \"We did not considerenough what I said at the beginning of the schoolyear with regard to these children.\" The teachers, in their turn, accused the stu- dents of showing a lack of will in their independentwork. Steiner answered, \"That is a problem that lieswith the children, and that one we do not need todiscuss. What is important now is how we copewith the children.\" The situation continued, vehemently, into the following year. The students became morally neg-lected, got into trouble, and some of them had to beasked to leave. Steiner could see no other way butto blame the state of affairs on the teachers, theirlack of interest in the pupils, the absence of contact,the lecturing instead of teaching that had becomethe rule, the general sloppiness. Neither teachersnor students were fully engaged in the lessons. Social tensions made the situation worse when it was suggested that a small administrative circleshould be established. Strong mutual distrustbecame apparent. The teachers' meetings as suchwere put into question. Steiner said, \"I feel like IMan). The lectures are not just intellectually pleas-ing; Steiner, with his subtle sense of humor, againproves himself an expert on the adolescent soul.The presentation moves on to explain at a deeperlevel the \"understanding of the world\" that isneeded for teaching adolescents. The teacherneeds to become a representative of the world.Those teachers who have nothing narrow-mindedabout them represent the \"wide world.\" Studentsbegin to choose their own authorities and todevelop their first ideals inspired by the authentic-ity of their teachers. Here lies, too, the secret of afruitful living together of different generations. The lectures end with the suggestion that one should feel as if the spirit dispersed itself amongthe college of teachers like a living cloud, as if liv-ing spirits were called on to help to instill spiritual-ity in the souls, a \"prayer-like\" rising up to thespirit. \"Life\" or vibrancy is a recurring motif. Theconclusion is a parenthesis to the first lecture oftheThe Foundations of Human Experience (Study of Man), which deals with the spiritual task of educa-tion. It returns in the form of a meditation: We have the will to work, letting flow into our work, that which from out of thespiritual world, in soul and spirit, in lifeand body, strives to become human in us. InThe Foundations of Human Experience (Study of Man), this idea was expressed: \"The task of edu-cation conceived in the spiritual sense is to bringthe soul-spirit into harmony with the life body.\"What is the difference between the two? The med-itative version focuses on the teacher himself,\"strives to become human in us.\" Education is self-education. In summary, Education for Adolescents (The Supplementary Course) is in character closer toPractical Advice to Teachers because a 10th grade was about to be added to the high school.Detailed curriculum indications were developed inthe teachers' meetings. The lectures mentionedintroduce three essentially new practical methodswith suggestions for their application: the cosmicand earthly orientation of the interest (the astralviewpoint); children with rich and poor imagina-tion (which has more to do with the ability toremember, the etheric viewpoint); and the three-fold approach to teaching\u2014over two days\u2014that 12 \u00b7 What Can Rudolf Steiner's Words to the First Waldorf School Teachers Tell Us Today?location, the activity in the process of nourish- ment, the rhythmic activity\u2014which is throughand through a healing activity\u2014and the perceiv-ing activity if we regard it from outside. Regardedfrom within, educational activity is entirely a per-ceiving activity. In short, all activities, apart from rhythmic ones, are adverse to health. Everything that isadverse to health has to be counteracted by high-er healing processes, through education that ismetamorphosed healing. The forces inherent in education are metamorphoses of therapeuticforces: They are therapeutic forcestransformed. The goal of all our edu-cational thinking must be to trans-form this thinking so as to rise fruit-fully from the level of physical think-ing to spiritual thinking. Steiner went on to describe a new way of judging that was not based on\"right\" and \"wrong\" or \"true\" and\"false,\" but on \"healthy\" and \"ill.\"This was followed by fundamentalconsiderations regarding the effect oflife-infused teaching on the child andon the physiology of the will. The third lecture concludes with a grim pic- ture. Michael fights with the dragon while a blackveil covers the picture. \"Then one would realizethat behind it there is something that must not beshown....\" And the battle with the dragon thatmust not be shown is the battle with the dragonof the dead, of that which comes from the dead-ened knowledge of our times. \"There the dragonbecomes especially horrible. One might almostsay that the correct symbol for institutions ofhigher education today would be a thick blackpall....\" Further, To live in the truth means to unite one- self with Michael. We must unite ourselveswith Michael whenever we enter the class-room; only through this can we bring withus the necessary strength. Verily, Michael isstrong. On the next morning Steiner gave the teachers \"a summary\" of what had been said, known asthe second teachers' meditation.have contracted lockjaw from the bad attitudetoward the meetings.\" Questions of discipline recurred because the teachers felt powerless. Steiner called on the foreignlanguage teachers to work together to find a way ofteaching instead of complaining to each other aboutstudents' lack of understanding. The meeting of 6February 1923 is recommended to all who wish toexperience how dramatic a situation it was. (This isthe meeting at which Steiner spoke about large-headed and small-headed children. It is also themeeting at which a failed grammarlesson is described, including itseffect on threefoldness.) In the third school year, which had started so pleasantly, onlyseven meetings with teachers tookplace. During the difficult fourthand fifth years, Steiner attended15 meetings per year. In theautumn of 1923 a crisis loomed asteachers struggled under the pres-sure of immense and, partly, newdemands. Following a phone call,Steiner managed to fit in a visit tothe school. He spent 15 and 16October in Stuttgart, giving threelectures and meeting with the teachers. Theexhausted teaching staff heard lectures thatbelong to the most difficult of Steiner's presenta-tions on education. As with the opening lecture inBalance in Teaching, the beginning is unexpected.Gymnast, rhetorician, and professor\u2014that is,those who live not in balance but act, talk, orthink in isolation\u2014have to undergo a metamor-phosis. The weakness of a professor is described:\"Today we usually think because we do not knowwhat else to do, and that is why we have so fewreal thoughts.\" The second and third lectures are given on 16 October with a teachers' meeting taking place inbetween. What is the main theme of these pre-sentations? As Steiner spoke about curative edu-cation for the first time on 6 February, heexplained, surprisingly, the difference betweenhealing processes in medicine and in education.They work at different levels. New aspects ariseregarding knowledge of the human being: There are the movements of walking, grasp- ing, the movement of the limbs, outer changes of Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1Christof Wiechert \u00b7 13 In Europe, in wide parts ofthe world, thou-sands have beeninspired by thisimpulse to devel-op educationout of the art oflife.Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1self education. If the subject matter undergoes a certain process in the soul, one inspires creativityof teaching in oneself. Steiner calls this the \"imme-diate source of inspiration\" which allows the\"right method to present itself.\" This descriptionimmediately preceded that of the veiled battle ofMichael with the dragon, and it refers to Steiner'swords about the sourness of the teacher in theclassroom. It seems that these words were especially called for in October 1923. Steiner's deeply feltpain was noticeable when he spoke of the criminalproceedings against Gandhi. Although the Britishjudge greatly admired him personally, he sen-tenced him to years of imprisonment. Why didSteiner raise this here? Because it is a picture of asituation in which the truth cannot create theright conditions for itself. In truth there is a newart of education. Can it create the necessary con-ditions for itself? TheFifthYear After October 1923 Steiner ceased to give lectures to teachers alone. Between the lectures of 15 and16 October he also attended a teachers' meetingthat was devoted to the written notice, given pre-maturely, by a member of the administrativecouncil (a kind of executive board) that had beenso difficult to install. Inner opposition had beennoticeable when teachers were appointed on 30March 1923 and was apparent again now. On theoutside, people acted according to their agree-ments, while inwardly they rejected them, as theyrejected the school's Director, Steiner himself: The general opinion has been that I should select the teachers. We should continuewith that, but now the problem is thatalthough that opinion has not changed infact, it has changed in feeling, in how welook at the situation. I may have to posethe question now of whether the facultymembers want to select the teachers them-selves. Steiner called this outward agreement in con- junction with inner opposition the \"Stuttgart sys-tem.\" Many of Steiner's suggestions met this kindof opposition, such as his ideas concerning moreefficient foreign language teaching or the initiallyLet us summarize again. The fourth and fifth school years were riddled with crises. In the upperschool contact with the students was lost, theteachers could not rise above lecturing and couldnot find a warm and interested approach to thestudents. Added to that was the deep lack of trustwithin the teaching faculty when a small adminis-trative circle was about to be formed. Steinerhelped as much as he could. On average he waswith the teachers once a month. He tried to help with the\u2014interposed\u2014lectures later published as Deeper Insights into Education (included in some editions of Balance in Teaching). The second sentence of the first lecture is this: After all, the fruitfulness of our activity in an institution like the Waldorf Schooldepends ... on the ability of the teachersto develop the attitude that will enablethem to carry through their work withassurance and be active in the right way.On this occasion, therefore, I would like tospeak in a particular about the teachersthemselves. Did he ask too much of the teachers? The lec- tures are not about pedagogical questions butabout questions of lifestyle, the overcoming of ourinner gymnast, rhetorician, and professor. Allthree have to fuse into one whose actions areimbued with life. Further, the clear divisionbetween therapeutic and pedagogical healingtouches us. Why? Had it become a habit to referwhat could not be mastered pedagogically tomedicine and psychology? Steiner's presentationson the physiology of the will relate to teachers aswell as to the effect on children when a processbetween action and thinking is developed in a les-son. Whenever we guide a child into some form of action while he is thinking, we call forth a state ofbalance between the formation of carbonic andcyanic acids. In human life everything actuallydepends upon symmetry being produced betweenthese two things. These great gestures all express the same thing: Dear teachers, take hold of these insights,use them to heal yourselves. Become alive andtruthful in your doing. Gaining a personal rela-tionship to teaching content is part of a teacher's14 \u00b7 What Can Rudolf Steiner's Words to the First Waldorf School Teachers Tell Us Today?will be a veritable child of concern\") was men- tioned again in this farewell letter, with his urgent-ly expressed hope that the teachers should not letgo of what they had built together. If the collegeof teachers was united by the \"active power ofthought\" (which was not possible during Steiner'slifetime), it could be done. What had beenachieved so far would \"strongly work among theteachers of this school.\" The Waldorf School is truly a child needing special care, but above all, it is also a visible signof the fruitfulness of Anthroposophy within thespiritual life of mankind. If all teachers faithfully carry within their hearts the awareness of this fruitfulness, the GoodSpirits, watching over this School, will be able towork actively; then divine spirit-power will prevailin all the deeds of the teachers. TheStuttgartMiracle Steiner had to say farewell to the school because he had no \"wings free to fly.\" But the school wasin a dire situation: It was in danger of losing itsidentity. The words, \"I need to give things a newdirection,\" only make sense in this context. Despite all these difficulties, enough persons in and around the school carried within them theliving impulse of the art of education. AfterSteiner's death in March 1925 they were able towork on in his spirit so that the art of educationcould grow triumphantly all over the world. Noteven the atrocities of the Nazis could stifle thisimpulse. In Europe, in wide parts of the world,thousands have been inspired by this impulse todevelop education out of the art of life. Whereverwe are in the world, we may have an immediateexperience of the healing effect of education if itunites itself with life and allows itself to be nour-ished by it. If life is understood as the expressionof spiritual processes, the art of education canbring about the healing and renewal of our cultur-al life. We can therefore say that what Steiner crit-ically referred to as the \"Stuttgart system,\" name-ly the reluctance to comply with his suggestions,was turned into its opposite after his death andbecame the \"Stuttgart miracle.\" His educationalimpulse had risen and come to life again, spread-ing around the globe. We should be clear that the topics of this paper do not constitute simply a historical exer-failing preparations for the final examination(Abitur). Important indications for the now com-plete curriculum followed in the fifth and sixthschool years. The form and content of languagelessons were revised, but problems with studentsreappeared. Teachers were unable to engage stu-dents in a fertile pedagogical relationship. The sixth school year brought more failings that Steiner had to blame on the teachers. In thesecond to last conference he severely criticizes theteachers' tiredness in class. \"Inner opposition\"became apparent in the fact that lecturing, anacademic teaching style, had increased ratherthan decreased. Contact with the students waslost. \"I have often mentioned it, but you have notreally done much to relieve the situation....\" Helplessness speaks from these words. Again and again Steiner mentioned the lack of interest inthe students and of enthusiasm for the task inhand. One teacher asked whether the \"Doctor\"could not help to establish contact with the pupils.Steiner had to repeat that it was a question ofinterest, of affinity with the students, of enthusi-asm, and not of lectures. We can feel how hecame to the conclusion, \"I need to give things anew direction\" (15 July 1924). The last recordedsentence of the last meeting with the teachers on3 September 1924 is: \"I want to give some lectureslater in September or early October about themoral aspects of education and teaching.\" It washis last visit to the school. TheSixthYear \"I want to give some lectures ... about the moral aspects of education and teaching.\" One oftenhears this sentence quoted out of context as if itwere something that was still objectively missingfrom Steiner's guidelines for an art of education.This is not the case. The sentence was spoken in aparticular crisis at the school and referred to thepedagogical abilities of, primarily, the upperschool teachers. \"Moral\" implies a personal rela-tionship of the teachers to the students that bene-fits the latter. This concern comes to expression in a moving way in the farewell letter Steiner wrote to theteachers two weeks before his death. The \"childof concern\" to which Steiner referred at the end ofthe teacher training course in the last discussionwith the teachers (\"For me this Waldorf School Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1Christof Wiechert \u00b7 1516 \u00b7 What Can Rudolf Steiner's Words to the First Waldorf School Teachers Tell Us Today? cise, but that the problems experienced during the first six years of the Waldorf School are essential-ly the same as those we face today, albeit in dif-ferent contexts and circumstances. We should alsobe clear how Steiner, with his power of judgment,his advice, and his unconditional loyalty to theimpulse initiated by Emil Molt, tried to help. Thesecan also give us direction today.

InTowards the Deepening of Waldorf Education, Pedagogical Section. -------------------- ChristofWiechert is an international lecturer and head of the Pedagogical Section of the School of Spiritual Science at the Goetheanum in Dornach,Switzerland. He was a teacher at the Waldorf school inThe Hague, Netherlands, for thirty years, a co-founderof the Dutch State Waldorf Teacher Training Seminar,and a Council member in the Anthroposophical Societyof the Netherlands.

A teacher first noticed the little boy\u2014 small but chunky, maybe a second grader\u2014thentwo other boys, a bit older, walking near him.One of the two called out: \"Hey, Fatty! You stinkup the soccer field! You suck at soccer!\" The object of the taunt took a deep breath and squared his shoulders, then turned to face hisattackers. \"You're right,\" he said. \"I'm not good atsoccer. And you are really good\u2014one of the bestin the school. But you know what? I'm really goodat art. I can draw almost anything.\" The air seemed to go out of the boy who had hurled the insult, and he said: \"You're not so bad.Want me to show you some moves after school?\"Then the pair walked off in another direction, thelittle guy still standing near the teacher. \"Gimme five!\" she said to him, acknowledging how he had handled the situation. This teacheralso found the second grader's teacher and let herknow what he had done. Today there are more and more examples in the U.S. of schools that are paying attention to chil-dren's social and emotional learning (SEL) as abasic part of their school's culture, structure, ped-agogy, and curriculum frame-works. Imagine a schoolwhere: The uniqueness, diversity, and inherent value of everyindividual are honored, andeducation of the whole child isa basis for a lifelong process. Students recognize and manage their emotions, solvetheir own conflicts on theplayground, and feel safeenough to discuss concernswith their teachers and class-mates by taking an active role in school improve-ment and governance. The school staff pays more attention to equip- ping students with the skills they need toapproach the \"tests of life\" rather than havingtheir students' school experience be composed of\"a life of tests.\" The school leadership shifts from a centralized concept of power to approaches that help individ-uals and groups in the school to self-organize andsolve problems cooperatively. School spirit comes as much from collaboration, connection, and engaging classroom practices asit does from, for example, winning a footballgame. A coordinated, well-planned and evidence-based social and emotional learning program is seen asnot an either/or choice in terms of a student'spotential for academic success but rather as oneenhancing the other. The dream school described here is not out of our reach. This kind of school is becoming moreand more the norm, not the exception, inAmerican education. Thousands of schools in theU.S.\u2014according to the latest data, 59% ofschools in the U.S. have some form of social andemotional learning curricula at various stages ofimplementation 1\u2014are adopting research-based social and emotional learning programs in thecontext of safe and supportive school, family, and community learning environ-ments in which children feel val-ued, respected, connected, andengaged in their learning. Whyare more and more U.S. schoolsystems embracing this expand-ed vision of education? Whatare the challenges we face andwhat do we need to do to movethis vision of education for-ward? This report outlines the jour- ney that has taken place in the U.S. over the past few decades to implement high-quality social and emotional learning (SEL) pro-gramming as a regular part of kindergarten tograde 12 education. It describes the following:C Growing evidence sug- gests that a key com-ponent in meeting edu-cational goals for chil-dren, academic as wellas social, is social andemotional learning.

[Editor'snote: The full report also containsa study of how Illinois is adoptingSEL programming at the state level.] I will take a closer look at the Anchorage School District in Alaska, which has been actualiz-ing a vision of SEL as a basic part of the district'smission for close to two decades. I will also exam-ine the implementation of SEL at PS 24, The Dual-Language School for International Studies in NewYork City. I will conclude with some thoughtsabout steps we still need to take in the U.S. tomake SEL a household term and the accepted waywe educate American children. EducationintheUnitedStates The U.S. system of education is complex, multi- dimensional, and among the largest systems ofeducation in the world. Because the population ofthe U.S. is increasing, so is enrollment in all levelsof education, both public and private. The coun-try is divided into more than 15,000 independent-ly operated public school districts headed bysuperintendents and more than 80,000 individualschools headed by principals. 2 The governing structure of the U.S. education- al system consists of each school district's havinga local school board. Each of the 50 states has achief state school officer, a governor, and a statelegislature. There are six regional accreditingagencies and one U.S. Department of Education,which is in charge of national initiatives thatinclude funding and other issues of legal compli-ance. 3There are vast differences in race or ethnic-ity, wealth, religion, age, and population densityamong the various states. Although the Federalgovernment contributes only 10% of each state'stotal education funding, it issues about 90% of the commands. 4 Children attend compulsory edu-cation from 1st grade (about sixyears old) to 12th grade (about17-18 years old). 5There are 54,000 elementary schools, whichusually cover grades from pre-kindergarten through grade 5,and 18,000 secondary schools,which are sometimes composed ofmiddle schools (grades 6-8) andhigh schools (grades 9-12). Thereare variations in the way the 12years of schooling are divideddepending on the number of chil- dren in any given neighborhood. Pre-kindergartenand kindergarten are not yet universal. About 49 million students attend public schools and another 6.1 million attend privateand independent schools, to which families needto pay tuition fees. Currently, about 1 million chil-dren are home-schooled. 6The number of children ages 5-17 who speak a language other thanEnglish in the home more than doubled between1979 and 2005, with 1 out of 5 school-age chil-dren speaking a language other than English athome today. 738% of public school students are minority or children of color. Only 10% second-ary school teachers, 14% elementary teachers,16% principals and 4% superintendents, how-ever, are minorities. The pedagogical staff is com-posed of 2.8 million public school teachers andabout 70,000 principals who are the heads of theschools. 8 In 1900 in the U.S., only about 7% of Americans had a high school diploma. About75% lived on farms. Today, only 3% live onfarms and about 75% have high schooldiplomas. 9The average public school in 1900 enrolled 40 students, and the size of the averageschool district was 120 students. Today, an aver-age elementary school enrolls more than 400pupils, and a typical high school enrolls morethan 2,000 pupils. In 1900, schools were moreeconomically, racially, and ethnically homoge-neous. 10School systems throughout theUnited States arestarting to realizethat SEL for itself inbenefits to individ-ual children and tosociety.Linda Lantieri \u00b7 19 Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1Today's schools face unprecedented chal- lenges to educate an increasingly multicultural and multilingual student body and to address thewidening social and economic disparities in U.S.society. Of the more than 300 million people liv-ing in the U.S., 11more than 40 million move in a year, and of these, 7 million are school-age chil-dren. Further, we have no system to track a stu-dent who moves from one state to another. 12 Kindergarten teachers say that about 20% of children entering kindergartendo not yet have the necessarysocial and emotional skills tobe \"ready\" for kindergarten. Ofvery low income children, asmany as 30% may not havethe necessary skills. 13About a third of today's students donot graduate from high schoolafter four years. In 2003, 88%of Asians, 85% of whites,80% of blacks, and 57% ofHispanics had a high schooldiploma. The U.S. now ranks10th in the world in the per-centage of youth who graduate from high school.We were first about 30 years ago. 14 After high school, of those graduates who do not directly enter the workforce, some studentsenter technical and vocational institutions. Othersattend community college, which is usually fortwo years, or attend a four-year college or univer-sity. The average four-year college student\u2014public or private\u2014will graduate with a debt of$18,000, and this number is increasing. 15 ChallengesthatFaceAmericanYouth andSELasaSolution Our experience of the world as children was vastly different from the world our children face. Today'sworld includes all kinds of stressors that didn'teven exist when we were growing up. As an ele-mentary teacher during the 1970s and later as anadministrator in New York City schools, I startedto notice that young people's social and emotion-al development seemed to be in a serious decline.I was seeing children coming to school moreaggressive, more disobedient, more impulsive,sadder, and lonelier. Thomas Achenbach con-firmed my observations; his groundbreaking stud-ies of thousands of American children, first in themid-1970s and then again in the late 1980s,proved this to be true. America's children\u2014fromthe poorest to the most affluent\u2014displayed adecline across the board in scores on more thanforty measures designed to reflect a variety ofemotional and social capacities. 16 Children in America today face a host of unprecedented challenges to their safe andhealthy development. National statistics hint at the scope of these challenges:15% to 22% of the nation'syouth experience social, emo-tional, and health requiring childrenexperience school 14% of students12-18 years of age report hav-ing been bullied at school in thepast 6 months. 17 The 2005 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)\u2014themost current year available\u2014revealed a large percentage of American high school students are involved withsubstance abuse, risky sexual behavior, violence,and mental health difficulties. For example,16.9% of high school students had seriously con-sidered attempting suicide; more than 40% usedalcohol; close to 30% had ridden in a car withsomeone who had been drinking within 30 daysof the survey; and almost 20% had carried aweapon some time during the past month. 18 Threats to learning can be found on the home front as well. Young people today have virtuallyuncensored media access through the Internet,cable television, and music outlets; they are bom-barded as never before by commercial messagesthat tout unceasing consumption and glamour asthe routes to happiness. Young people today arefar less likely than previous generations to haveadults around them in their non-school hours, asmothers' labor-force participation has grown from10% in the 1950s to more than 78% in 1999. 19 As of 2004, more than half of all children willgrow up in a home without a biological fatherpresent. 20 According to the 2006 Indicators of School Crime and Safety report from the National CenterWhen social and emo- tional skills are taughtand mastered, theyhelp children succeednot just in school, butalso in all avenues oflife.20 \u00b7 Social Emotional Intelligence for Education Statistics, 27% of schools report daily or weekly bullying incidents. In 2005, morethan a quarter of students ages 12-18 reportedbeing bullied within the past six months, with58% of these students bullied once or twice dur-ing that period, 25% bullied once or twice amonth, 11% bullied once or twice a week, and8% of students bullied almost every day. 21 In the past, the dominant paradigm in response to this decline in American children'ssocial and emotional capacities focused on tryingto identify the risk factors that caused this antiso-cial behavior. There were almost two decades ofschool-based \"prevention wars,\" like the \"war ondrugs.\" In the last two decadeswe have witnessed a healthyparadigm shift. Researchersand practitioners are studyingthe concept of resilience\u2014theinnate ability we all have toself-correct and thrive in theface of life's challenges. BonnieBernard, a pioneer in the fieldof strength-based approaches,has helped us take a look athow young people's strengths and capabilitiescan be developed in order to protect them fromthe potential harm that these circumstances rep-resent. 22 Despite, and perhaps because of, the chal- lenges young people face, growing evidence sug-gests that a key component in meeting education-al goals for children, academic as well as social, issocial and emotional learning. 23Robust research studies have shown that students in schools thatuse an evidence-based SEL curriculum significant-ly improve in their attitudes toward school, theirbehaviors, and their academic performance.Almost 30 studies have shown that SEL programsresult in student improvements in achievementtest scores\u2014an average of 14% over studentswho do not learn SEL skills. Furthermore, theimpact of SEL programs seem to be long-lasting. 24 One major multi-year study found that by the time they were adults, students who received SELin grades 1-6 (6 to 11 years of age) had an 11%higher grade point average, significantly greaterlevels of school commitment and attachment toschool at age 18, and greater school success.Among students required to repeat a grade, theretention rate for students who received SEL wasbetter at 14%, versus 23% for control students.Further, SEL students demonstrated a 30% lowerincidence of school behavior problems at age 18,a 20% lower rate of violent delinquency at age18, and a 40% lower rate of heavy alcohol use atage 18. 25 WhySocialandEmotionalLearning IsEssential A growing body of research suggests that helping children develop good social and emotional skills early in life makes a big difference in their long-term health and wellbeing. Studies have shown that children's social and emo-tional functioning and behaviorbegin to stabilize around theage of eight, and can predictthe state of their behavior andmental health later in life. 26In other words, if children learn toexpress emotions constructive-ly and engage in caring andrespectful relationships beforeand while they are in lower ele- mentary grades, they are more likely to avoiddepression, violence, and other serious mentalhealth problems as they grow older. Conclusionslike these may seem obvious but, in the face ofnature-nurture debates, provide evidence for theimportance of deliberate and focused education inthese areas. School systems throughout the United States are starting to realize that SEL more than pays foritself in benefits to individual children and to soci-ety. Providing children with comprehensive socialand emotional learning programs characterizedby safe, caring, and well-managed learning envi-ronments and instruction in social and emotionalskills addresses many of these learning barriers.School attachment\u2014a sense of connectednessand belonging\u2014is enhanced, risky behaviorsreduced, and academic achievement positivelyinfluenced. Many schools in the U.S. have begun to see the value in creating and supporting the schoolconditions and student capacities that SEL pro-vides. Many educators today are working tochange and manage school environments or cli-mates\u2014in classrooms, in hallways, on playing Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1Attending to social and emotional needs is crit-ical. Students need tofeel good about them-selves to learn.fields, and in clubs. They are also working to develop students' skills and knowledge, skills andknowledge that maximize their potential for opti-mal performance, human connection, and effec-tive relationships. These are skills like recognizingand managing our emotions, developing caringand concern for others, establishing positive rela-tionships, making responsible decisions, andhandling challenging situations constructively.These skills, for example, allow children to calmthemselves when angry, make friends, resolveconflicts respectfully, and make ethical and safechoices. Students who are given clear behavioral stan- dards and social skills, allowing them to feel safe,valued, confident, and chal-lenged, will exhibit betterschool behavior and learnmore. This statement is of mon-umental importance as weattempt to improve the out-comes of education in the U.S.In fact, SEL skills and the sup-portive environments in whichthey are taught seem to con-tribute to the resiliency of allchildren\u2014those without identi-fied risks and those at-risk ofor already exhibiting emotional or behavioralproblems and in need of additional support. Daniel Goleman has contributed much to our thinking about the need to nurture the social andemotional lives of children. In his groundbreakingbookEmotional Intelligence , Goleman summarized research from the fields of neuroscience and cog-nitive psychology that identify EQ\u2014emotionalintelligence\u2014as being as important as IQ in termsof children's healthy development and future lifesuccess. He wrote: One of psychology's open secrets is the relative inability of grades, IQ, or SATscores, despite their popular mystiques, topredict unerringly who will succeed in life....There are widespread exceptions to therule that IQ predicts success\u2014many (ormore) exceptions than cases that fit therule. At best, IQ contributes about 20 per-cent to the factors that determine life suc-cess, which leaves 80 percent to otherforces. 27 Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1Goleman's work has helped educators, includ- ing me, understand the importance of emotionalintelligence as a basic requirement for the effec-tive use of one's IQ\u2014that is, one's cognitive skillsand knowledge. He made the connection betweenour feelings and our thinking more explicit bypointing out how the brain's emotional and execu-tive areas are interconnected physiologically,especially as these areas relate to teaching andlearning. The prefrontal lobes of the brain, whichare associated with emotional impulses, are alsostrongly associated with working memory andlearning. Educators and parents alike are now much more aware that when chronic anxiety, anger, or upset feelings intrude on chil-dren's thoughts, less capacityis available in working memoryto process what they are tryingto learn. This implies that, atleast in part, academic successdepends on a student's abilityto maintain positive socialinteractions. Schools across theU.S. today are beginning tosystematically help childrenstrengthen their EQs by equip-ping them with concrete skills for identifying and managing their emotions,communicating effectively, and resolving conflictsnonviolently. These skills help children to makegood decisions, to be more empathetic, and to beoptimistic in the face of setbacks. The hopeful news is that schools and parents, working together, can play pivotal roles in sup-porting children's healthy development in dealingwith their emotions and their relationships. In theU.S., this is referred to as social and emotionallearning because these are skills that can belearned and mastered, every bit as much as lan-guage or mathematics or reading can be.Furthermore, teaching academic skills and socialand emotional skills is not an either/or proposi-tion. There is a great deal of research evidence toindicate that students perform better when aca-demics are combined with SEL. 28When social and emotional skills are taught and mastered, theyhelp children succeed, not just in school, but in allavenues of life. The SEL movement in the U.S. is related to other national youth development and preventionLinda Lantieri \u00b7 21 When children actively engage in meaningful,relevant learning expe-riences, ...they learnconcepts and skills in adeep and genuine way.initiatives, such as character education and school-based health promotion programs. SEL issignificantly different from these, however,because it systematically addresses the numeroussocial and emotional variables that place youth atrisk for school failure, such as a lack of attach-ment to a significant adult or the inability to man-age emotions. Many of the early social and emotional learn- ing efforts in schools were developed to combatrisky behaviors such as teens' use of drugs andalcohol, dropping out of school, unwanted teenpregnancies, and other pitfalls of adolescence.These effects are related to children's social andemotional development by focusing on a singleproblem or issue such as preventing substanceabuse. SEL, however, provides educators with acommon language and frame-work to organize their activi-ties. SEL is an inclusiveapproach that covers theentire spectrum of social andemotional competencies thathelp children to be resilientand successful learners. Whenthe W. T. Grant Foundationcommissioned a study of allsuch programs to see whatactually made some of themwork (while others did not), the teaching of socialand emotional skills emerged among the crucialactive ingredients. TheFoundingoftheCollaborativefor Academic,Social,andEmotional Learning(CASEL) The Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL)29has been at the forefront of moving the agenda of social and emo- tional learning forward in the United States.Founded in the U.S., CASEL has been providingnational and international leadership for educa-tors, researchers, and policy makers to advancethe science and practice of social and emotionallearning since 1994. CASEL's organizationalvision and mission guide all that it does: VISION: We envision a world where families, schools, and communities work together to pro-mote children's success in school and life and tosupport the healthy development of all children.In this vision, children and adults are engaged,life-long learners who are self-aware, caring andconnected to others, and responsible in their deci-sion-making. Children and adults achieve to theirfullest potential and participate constructively ina democratic society. MISSION: To establish social and emotional learn- ing as an essential part of education. CASEL investigates the best ways to advance children's social and emotional learning and pro-vides training to educational leaders and schoolstaff in how to make SEL the foundation for aca-demic success, disseminating research findings onthe most effective practices and programs to edu-cators, researchers, and policy makers. Working in collaboration with otherorganizations, CASEL promotesthe principle that safe, support-ive learning communities are anessential component of effectiveschool reform. CASEL was inspired by the vision of its cofounders, educa-tor-philanthropist EileenRockefeller Growald and formerNew York Goleman. In 1994, Growald, Goleman, and collaborators con-vened leading educators and researchers to dis-cuss effective whole-school change practices thatincorporate rigorous scientific research. Out ofthis meeting came both the term \"social and emo-tional learning\" and the organization\u2014CASEL\u2014to gather and disseminate reliable informationabout evidence-based SEL strategies and to trans-late scientific knowledge into high-quality educa-tional approaches for all students. During its first decade, CASEL defined the field of SEL in the text, Social and Emotional Learning: Guidelines for Educators, published in1996 by the Association for Supervision andCurriculum Development (ASCD). This documentwas sent as a member benefit to more than100,000 educational leaders. CASEL establishedthe research base for the field of SEL, publishingthe essential characteristics and documented ben-efits of high-quality, evidence-based SEL programsfor children.

SocialandEmotionalLearninginthe AnchorageSchoolDistrict,Alaska30 Russian Jack Elementary School, Anchorage, Alaska, May 1993 (Linda Lantieri's journalentry): 31 It is spring in Anchorage, Alaska. This is my first trip to Russian Jack Elementary School butmy eighth trip to the Anchorage School District(ASD) since 1988, when I first started to assistthis school district in paying attention to chil-dren's hearts as well as to their minds. RussianJack has been part of the Resolving ConflictCreatively Program (RCCP) for four years now....Upon entering Russian Jack, I notice a sign onthe entrance. It reads, \"Our mission at RussianJack, a school of cultural diversity, is to ensurethat each student is actively involved in theirlearning, while developing a sense of self andbecoming a productive citizen who will contributeto society in a meaningful way.\" Already I have a sense of this school. I contin- ue down the hallway, taking in my new surround-ings. To the right there's a large glass displaycase. Inside are a myriad of art projects, brightcolorful masks, and drums. A sign above reads,\"These masks and drums are representative of theculture of the Inuit people of Alaska. They weremade by our Young Ambassadors, students dedi-cated to promoting a deeper understanding of therich cultural diversity of the children at theRussian Jack Elementary School.\" Donna, the school's principal of six years, welcomes me. I had met Donna once before, at anRCCP advanced training for administrators a fewyears before. Donna offers to take time out of herbusy schedule to take me around the school. Shetalks about her school and how they've imple-mented RCCP. Heading up the stairs toward thesecond floor, I see a huge banner with P-E-A-C-Ein large, multicolored letters sewn over a pastelbackdrop. It is magnificent.

The resulting document,Safe and Sound, sold out 15,000 copies and hasbeen downloaded from CASEL's website more than150,000 times. CASEL research syntheses established the link between these programs and greater attachment toschool, less risky behavior, and greater studentassets, leading to better academic performance andsuccess in school and life. The CASEL text summa-rizing much of this work is Building Academic Success on Social and Emotional Learning: What Does theResearch Say? published in 2004 by Teachers College Press. Most recently, in partnership with urban,suburban, and rural schools in different parts of thecountry, CASEL has developed strategies for usingSEL as an organizing framework for coordinatingall of a school's academic, prevention, health pro-motion, and youth development activities.Knowledge and products developed from this workare combined with applications of the latestresearch in systems change, leadership develop-ment, and program implementation in the 400-page CASEL document, Sustainable Schoolwide SEL: Implementation Guide and Toolkit , which sold out its first printing of 2,000 copies and serves as the coreelement of CASEL's national training program. CASEL also advises districts, states, and coun- tries, providing technical assistance and training onpolicy approaches to support SEL and systems forexpanding practice on a broad scale. In the past two years CASEL has conducted 23 sold-out two-day school and district trainings with300 school teams (representing several hundredthousand students) from across the U.S. as well asAustralia, Spain, and Canada. In 2007, noting theresearch base for SEL and CASEL's role in the field,UNICEF contracted with CASEL to lead an evalua-tion of its Child Friendly Schools model, to assurebetter attention to student social and emotionaldevelopment. CASEL is having widespread influence on school practices, policies, and professional develop-ment throughout the world. Its website\u2014www.casel.org\u2014where papers and reports fromCASEL's and others' projects are posted, attractsvisitors from throughout the world. In addition,periodic reports are shared with the more than10,000 subscribers to CASEL's electronic newsletter,CASEL Connections.

He titled his article\"Johnny Can Learn to Negotiate.\" Since Educational Leadership is a journal to which almost every princi- pal in America subscribes, we became nationalnews and began to receive many inquiries. One ofthem was from the Anchorage School District inAlaska, saying that they were ready to sponsor acourse in \"peace education\" in three weeks. My firstthought was, \"Are you kidding? How could some-thing that was developed in urban New York Citybe of any use to a school system in Anchorage,Alaska? I also had a sense, however, that what wewere doing in NYC was going to catch on aroundthe country and that we needed to humbly sharewhat we had been learning. By the end of the day Icalled them back to say yes. Flying into Anchorage airport, the earth blan- keted in white, the imposing mountains at a dis-tance, I wondered whether this was a crazy idea\u2014a big mistake\u2014or whether our grassroots origins inNew York City, teaching young people how to man-age their emotions and resolve conflict nonviolent-ly, had a certain universality regardless of the dis-tance and differences that separated these twoplaces. In retrospect I understand how important it was to go to a place like Anchorage. Had I not expandedto the Anchorage School District next with our SELprogram, I suspect it would have taken me a longtime to realize that this kind of work could takehold in any school environment that was concernedabout these issues. Today, the ASD is the nation's88th largest school district, with about 50,000 stu-dents\u2014nearly 40% of Alaska's school children.Over 30% of ASD students live in poverty.Increasingly diverse, ASD now has a 50% minoritypopulation; 84 languages are spoken in its schools.The ASD has the largest population of Alaskanatives in the state. While the district is proud of itsethnic diversity, it is also experiencing the pains oflarge achievement gap among constituencies and ahuge dropout rate. In the summer of 2007 I made my 28th trip to the ASD. It has been a joy to work with such anTeachers and children alike greet us as we visit classrooms and observe them at work. Theyare working in groups, talking and sharing ideas.Classroom walls display several indicators thatResolving Conflict Creatively Program is in placeat this school. \"Put-up\" charts (giving examples ofthe opposite to Wordssuch as \"I-Messages\" and \"Active Listening\" arelisted as tools to be used for communication inthe classroom. There is calm in the air, not thefrenzy one can sometimes feel in schools. Recess begins. Donna is called to the office. I head out to the playground. It is a warm, clearday. The sun is up and shining almost all day atthis time of the year. The children are playful andcarefree. Mediators stand by in the lunchroomand outdoors. Several times a conflict begins toerupt, but mediators intervene immediately. I amtold that the library mediation room is availablein case it gets too cold to mediate outside. Throughout the day, children and teachers share their experiences with me. They talk aboutRussian Jack proudly and openly. They talk aboutthe benefits they see since RCCP has been at theirschool. They support their mediators, who theyfeel are helping to create a culture of nonviolenceat this school. Young people talk highly abouttheir teachers, principal, and mediation program.They feel safe at this school. \"It's a good school,\"says Nikita. \"Not like my other school where kidsused to fight all the time.\" These images from Anchorage offer hints of what can happen when the kind of educationalvision we have been talking about is put intopractice. Little did I know then what I knownow\u2014that the Anchorage School District (ASD)would lead the way for school districts across theU.S. to commit to implementing social and emo-tional learning standards and benchmarks. Howdid the ASD arrive at this place? What can welearn from them that can inform other school sys-tems throughout the U.S. and the world to makeSEL a core part of the mission and vision of anentire school district? Anchorage's SEL journey began in December 1987, when Tom Roderick, Executive Director of anongovernmental organization\u2014MorningsideCenter for Teaching Social Responsibility\u2014wasasked to write an article on the topic of childrenand violence for the contemporary issues section 24 \u00b7 Social Emotional Intelligenceal Assets Framework. Michael Kerosky, Supervisor of Anchorage's Safe and Drug-Free SchoolsProgram remembered how important this was: \"Itwas a radical shift for us. Instead of focusing onstopping negative risk behavior, we were focusingon building young people's strengths. Exposure tothis training also convinced [those at] the top thatthis kind of approach made sense. We also eachknew intuitively from working with young peoplethat this approach would work.\" The ASD engaged teachers, staff, principals, and the wider community in many meetings tobegin to identify which of the external develop-mental assets the family, school, and communitywere already providing their young people andwhich of the internal assets they were strengthen-ing through implementing researched-based SELprograms. The Developmental Assets Frameworkbecame common language at the ASD. Every newteacher was exposed to this training, as were busdrivers, security guards, and school secretaries.The entire community was involved in reflectingon the social, emotional, and ethical state of thechildren they served. As Michael Kerosky said, Adopting SEL benchmarks was based on the resiliency work that had been donebefore. That created the fertile ground forthis work not to be seen as 'social engineer-ing,' as it had been looked upon by many adecade earlier. In 2004 Anchorage passed another important milestone on its SEL journey. SuperintendentCarol Comeau, in an effort to consistently infusethe Search Institute's Developmental Assetsframework district-wide, convened a team of peo-ple to design an action plan. The team conceivedof the Social and Emotional Learning Six YearPlan. The plan had as its main premise the goal ofhaving SEL as an integral part of the curriculumframeworks of the entire district. To ensure thatthis plan would move forward, the school districtcommitted itself to creating a new position, theSocial and Emotional Learning CurriculumCoordinator. Victoria Blakeney, a veteran highschool teacher who had been actively incorporat-ing SEL in her high school English curriculum, wasselected for the position. In 2007, in a show ofsupport, the school board voted to absorb theamazing group of people, people who are changingthe vision of education for the whole country. Hereis their story. TheAnchorageSchoolDistrict'sSEL JourneyofSuccess In an era in which the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act has forced schools to concentrate on increasingstudents' test scores rather than engaging them ina world in which they will succeed, the AnchorageSchool District was able to place social and emo-tional learning at the center of its mission. How didthe district get its families, community, and schoolboard not to dismiss this kind of curriculum as \"softand touchy-feely\" and help them recognize thatsocial and emotional learning can be part of a rig-orous and achievement-oriented education? Wehave much to learn from their example. In August 2006, the Anchorage School Board became the first school district in the U.S. to unani-mously approve the implementation of SEL stan-dards and benchmarks for incorporation into thedistrict's academic program. How was this diverseurban school district, with a teaching staff of3,500, able to make this significant commitment tosuch a holistic vision of education for the 50,000students it serves? The story involves the coura-geous leadership of dynamic superintendent CarolComeau, forward-minded thinking on the part ofthe wider leadership of the district, and a long termdemocratic decision-making process committed tobuilding staff and community understanding andsupport for these efforts. For two decades the ASD has had an expansive view of what skills a graduate needs to be ready forthe 21st century. During 1988-1998, it becamecommitted to implementing a few differentresearch-based SEL programs, including RCCP, inmany of its schools, well before most school sys-tems were even thinking in terms of prevention.During this same period, the district was also intro-duced to the work of the Search Institute inMinnesota, which had identified forty \"developmen-tal assets\" that young people need to be successful.The more of these assets young people had in theirlife, the Search Institute research found, the morelikely they were to grow up healthy, productive,and caring. School board members and superintendents statewide started to be trained in the Development- Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1Linda Lantieri \u00b7 25Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1Social Management = \"I will...\" This resounded with all of us and, from then on, the task seemed easier. We coulduse as our mnemonic the phrase, \"I am, Ican, I care, I will.\" Once the committee drafted the standards, they aligned them with their correspondingDevelopmental Asset, to honor the framework thathad already been established in the district. Fromthere began a year's worth of listening sessions\u2014editing, informing, and trying to make the stan-dards accessible to all of their stakeholders. OnAugust 14, 2006, after an hour-long question andanswer session, and with much excitement, theAnchorage School Board adopted the implementa-tion of the SEL standards. During the following year, Vickie continued to work to align the standards with many of the otherexisting programs and curricula so that teacherscould see which of the standards were being taughtand which needed more focus. For example, theResolving Conflict Creatively Program (RCCP) wasimplemented in quite a few elementary schools, soVickie brought together a team of RCCP teachersand they evaluated the RCCP curriculum throughthe lens of which SEL standards were being directlytaught and in which lessons they were beingtaught. A similar alignment was done for the dis-trict-adopted health curriculum, the middle schoolAggressors, Victims, and Bystanders (AVB)Program, and 12 other programs or curricula cur-rently implemented in the district, including the ele-mentary reading curriculum. The long-term goal for the school district is to figure out how many of the SEL standards teachershave the potential of teaching by using their exist-ing curricula and which ones they need to findmore ways to support. More and more of theschools in Anchorage are self-selecting to add aresearch-based SEL program to their school day. The next task ASD is working on is figuring out how they will assess whether or not students havemastered SEL skills. The ASD sees their work as\"putting the assets into action.\" The adoption ofthese standards, however, does also seem to beempowering the various individual schools toaddress SEL more intentionally and programmati-cally. In order to support the deepening of the workaround SEL standards, the school district decidedto select two elementary, two middle, and two highSEL Curriculum Coordinator's salary, previouslygrant-funded, into the general fund. Under Vickie's direction, a district-wide steer- ing committee was created to help drive the SELinitiative. The academic curriculum frameworks ofthe ASD was and still is primarily standards-based, which means that for each subject that istaught, there are specific grade level appropriatecompetencies in which students are expected tobecome proficient. These are known as \"bench-marks\"\u2014competencies that are easily measurableand observable. The first task of the SEL SteeringCommittee, therefore, was to write SEL standardsand benchmarks to bring before the school board.The purpose of this strategy was to ensure thatthe teaching of social and emotional learningskills would be considered as important as any ofthe other curriculum areas students in theAnchorage School District were expected to learn. At this stage of its planning, the ASD Steering Committee reached out to the Collaborative forAcademic, Social, and Emotional Learning(CASEL). At that point CASEL was experiencedand committed to advancing the science andexpanding the practice of SEL in schools, schooldistricts, and state policy. The benchmarks andstandards Anchorage created were inspired byCASEL's work in the state of Illinois. The ASDSteering Committee also spent two years lookingat what other districts were doing and engagedeach other in reflective conversations about whatthey really wanted for their students in the socialand emotional learning domain. They got inputfrom staff and community and finally draftedtheir own version of the benchmarks and stan-dards. The Steering Committee creatively devisedan approach to organize and communicate whatthey were trying to do by using the four compo-nents of SEL as outlined by CASEL, which are self-awareness, social awareness, self-management,and social management. Vickie describes theprocess: I remember a great moment in our group when one of the steering commit-tee members realized that the four quad-rants that make up the goals for SELcould correspond with certain headings:Self-Awareness = \"I am...\"Self-Management = \"I Awareness = \"I care...\" 26 \u00b7 Social Emotional Intelligencethe original SEL steering committee, serving a piv- otal role in writing the ASD SEL Standards andBenchmarks. Because of the level of their invest-ment, the ASD has drawn national attention tothe field of SEL. In 2007, the George LucasEducation Foundation filmed an onsite documen-tary of ASD's SEL initiative for the online maga-zineEdutopia. Superintendent Comeau presented their work on SEL at the Council of Great CitySchools and the CASEL Forum in 2007. Manynationally known SEL leaders and practitionerssupport and collaborate with the ASD on thework they are doing. This national support hashelped to ensure that their implementation of SELis excellent. SocialandEmotionalLearningat PS24,theDual-LanguageSchool forInternationalStudiesin NewYorkCity Public School 24, also called the Dual-Language School for International Studies (Spanish andEnglish), is a school in which academic instruc-tion, social and emotional learning, and mentalhealth services are fully integrated for the benefitof students, families, and teachers. 32This elemen- tary school for children 4 to 12 years of age islocated in the heart of a largely Latino working-class neighborhood called Sunset Park inBrooklyn. Nearly half of the school's 839 studentsare learning English as a second language. Mostemigrated from Mexico, the Dominican Republic,Ecuador, and other countries in Spanish-speakingCentral and South America. Some children areChinese. About 90% of the students are eligiblefor free or reduced-price lunches, which is a clearindicator that they are from low-income families.New York City has more than a million publicschool students and 1,400 public schools. The stu-dent population of the entire school system isdiverse: 32.5% Black, 39% Latino or Hispanic,14% Asian, and 14.5% White. Inside the school building, signs of a child-cen- tered approach to teaching and learning are evi-dent. PS 24's walls are covered with children's col-orful artwork. Teachers aren't screaming in hall-ways or classrooms; the lunchroom is noisy, butthe children are engaged and mannerly. \"Visitorsto our school often comment about the warmthand respect students and adults show for eachother here,\" says Principal Christina Fuentes.schools to be SEL pilot schools. These pilot schoolsare helping the SEL Coordinator to determine whatresources or support schools need, and then Vickieworks to provide that for the pilot schools as wellas all of the other schools in the district. It also became apparent to the school district that they weren't really going to help studentsthrive in their SEL skills if they didn't focus on pro-viding them with a culturally responsive environ-ment in which to learn, given how culturally diversetheir student body was. Therefore Vickie workedwith the district's Culturally Responsive EducationAction Committee, spearheading the design of aCulturally Responsive Teaching Continuum. Thiscontinuum provides teachers with a look at theirpractices, showing them how culturally responsivethey currently are, and how they can move furtherthrough the continuum. Both tools\u2014the continuumand the SEL standards\u2014are used at various profes-sional development offerings at conferences andtrainings around the district. At least one team from every school in the dis- trict has now been trained in the use of both. Vickieis also an active member of various initiatives in thewider Anchorage community. For example, sheserves on committees around Anchorage aimed atclosing the achievement gap and ending racism asit exists in their community. ASD is currently work-ing on developing a district-wide plan to roll outdiversity training to all of its school personnel. Thedistrict has found that SEL and cultural responsive-ness work can be a perfect match in both building astrong sense of self-awareness and a willingness todeal with a formerly taboo subject\u2014racism. Finally, ASD is also developing a Standards Based Report Card for social and emotional learn-ing. The current report card has a place to scorethings like citizenship and responsibility. The scor-ing is arbitrary, however, and nearly meaningless toteachers and parents. A new report card is beingdesigned, therefore, with rubrics that will rate the15 SEL standards individually, giving teachers clearindicators by grade level (K-6) to help them to deter-mine whether or not the student is learning andapplying a standard. Anchorage's success has reached beyond Alaska. Superintendent Carol Comeau is recognizedas a national leader in SEL reform and serves onCASEL's Advisory Board.

Some of the mediators also become \"Peace Helpers\" who go into kindergarten through thirdgrade classrooms to set up \"peace corners\" to helpyounger students address problems that arise byresolving conflict nonviolently. A peace corner is aplace where a student can go for a few minutes ifhe or she is upset or having a conflict with some-one. Peace helpers are available on request to sitwith the upset students to help them feel better orwork things out. At PS 24, every kindergartenthrough grade three classroom now has a peacecorner and peace helpers. The school also operatesan after-school program, PAZ (\"Peace from A to Z\")every school day of the year for some 360 stu-dents. In the spring of 2007, some upper grade stu- dents got specialized training to become part of a\"diversity panel\" that shared their cultural storiesand experiences with various classrooms in theschool as part of the school's first ever \"DiversityWeek.\" Teachers were asked to discuss diversity intheir classrooms every day during that week andthe student diversity panel helped by making class-room presentations. When Heather shared her story in one class- room, she explained to her fellow students: It was hard for me in my old school. People made fun of me because I have onlyone hand. So I started playing sports\u2014basketball, football. And when I got betterat it, they started to leave me alone. Jason described his experience as an African American with the following remarks: I was in the park one day with my mom and her boyfriend. And I was bored, becauseonly younger kids were there. And then threewhite kids came into the park that were myage. I asked if I could play with them. Andthey said, \"No, we won't play with you.\"And I asked them why. And they said,\"Because you're black.\" I went away and Ithought about it. And I thought that theywere wrong, that it shouldn't make any dif-ference what color my skin was. So I wentback over to them and told them that.PS 24 has been implementing research-based social and emotional learning programs since theschool opened its doors in 1997. Explains Fuentes: Attending to social and emotional needs is critical. Students need to feel goodabout themselves to learn. If we want themto be risk-takers intellectually, we need tohelp them feel safe in school and at home.The more we address emotional needs, thefewer discipline problems we'll have. This isnot only right to do morally; it's a strategyto get kids to achieve academically. PS 24 has partnered with a nongovernmental organization, Morningside Center for TeachingSocial Responsibility, to carefully implement itsSEL curriculum. Morningside Center was foundedin 1982 by educators concerned about the dan-gers of nuclear war. Its mission is to help studentsand teachers learn creative, nonviolent ways ofdealing with conflict and cultural differences. Virtually all of the teachers have received pro- fessional development in SEL through theResolving Conflict Creatively Program (RCCP), oneof the longest running research-based K-8 SEL pro-grams in the U.S. Some of the teachers have alsobeen trained in a newer SEL program called the4Rs (Reading, Writing, Respect, and Resolution)Program, which integrates conflict resolution intoreading, writing, and speaking skills for grades K-5. Each unit of the 4Rs curricula begins with ateacher reading a book aloud to the students.Students practice SEL skills in the context ofunderstanding the story and its context in theirlives. Currently this program is undergoing anextensive three-year scientific evaluation, and ini-tial results are promising. Through both of theseefforts, the teachers at PS 24 are able to provideregular instruction for their students in SEL skills(for example: active listening, dealing with feel-ings, assertiveness, negotiation, mediation, deal-ing well with diversity, and making a difference). In addition, the school has approximately 40 trained peer mediators (4th and 5th graders) tohelp their classmates talk out problems and arriveat solutions. Mediators receive a three-day train-ing and learn a specific 17-step mediationprocess. Once trained, they work in teams of two,usually during lunch or recess. They wear peermediator T-shirts when they are \"on duty.\" The28 \u00b7 Social Emotional Intelligenceof the highest grades among schools rated. The school also received outstanding scores on theNYC-DOE's Learning Environment Survey. PS 24'ssurvey responses were above average in every cat-egory (academic expectations, communication,engagement, safety, and respect). In its most recent Quality Review Report, the NYC-DOE gave PS 24 its highest rating, calling ita \"well-developed school\" in all five areas evaluat-ed. The report noted that: The school has developed excellent partnerships with organizations dedicatedto conflict resolution and peace mediation.Students as young as kindergarten age aretrained as peacemakers and mediators.There have been no suspensions this cur-rent school year and only one last year...Children are happy, feel safe, and takean active role in their daily learning.Students who were questioned felt respect-ed by all teachers and were able to namenot one but several individual staff mem-bers whom they trusted. When children actively engage in meaningful, relevant learning experiences, as they do at PS24, they learn concepts and skills in a deep andgenuine way. As David Elkind wrote, \"Oncegrowth by integration has been accomplished, itis difficult\u2014if not impossible\u2014to break itdown.\" 33Creating an effective school-based SEL program that teaches young people how to inter-vene mindfully and respectfully in conflict situa-tions and to make ethical choices in their own per-sonal and social behavior requires the kind ofinstruction that goes beyond just telling studentswhat they ought to know and how they ought tobehave. It requires a pedagogy of active learningthat enables students to recognize and practicethe skills and ideas they have learned in the class-room in real life. The story that began this article is one power- ful example of this kind of learning in action. Theboys in that story had SEL instruction for at leasta couple of years. The boy who was insulted prac-ticed some important and standard techniques formanaging his emotions and handling the conflict.First, he paused and took a slow, deep breath.This is a technique taught to children to help themcontrol their emotions when they realize they areMany other aspects of PS 24's curriculum pro- mote SEL. For example, the school's dual languageprogram helps the many new immigrants make aneasier adjustment to their new country. Studentsread books of their own choosing, write from theirlife experiences, and practice their communicationskills in group discussions which foster SEL skills aswell. Of course, there are some children at PS 24 who need extra help in SEL (as there are children whoneed extra help in reading or math). For 2nd and3rd graders who continually get into trouble duringlunch and recess, a staff developer fromMorningside Center and the school's guidancecounselor provide \"lunch clubs,\" in which three orfour of these challenging younger students arepaired with older peer mediators to form a groupthat meets once a week for six weeks or more tocheck in with each other and get extra practice inSEL skills. For example, in these sessions they mightrole-play how to be strong without being mean inspecific situations. The lunch clubs have resulted insignificant improvements in the behavior of manyparticipating students. To address the needs ofyoungsters and their families who need even moresupport, the school has a relationship withLutheran Medical Center\u2014a local mental healthagency that provides trained therapists and coun-selors to work with families. A few years ago, PS 24 chose to become an \"empowerment school.\" Empowerment schools, inthe structure and governance of the New York CityDepartment of Education (NYC-DOE), get moreautonomy in exchange for greater accountability.The DOE piloted a fairer and more nuancedaccountability system in empowerment schools in2007. In this process, called \"value added,\" cohortsof students are tracked and their progress meas-ured from year to year, schools are compared withother schools that have similar student popula-tions, and schools receive a letter grade (A throughF). In the 2006-2007 school year, evidence came flooding in that PS 24's teaching efforts were hav-ing a major impact, not only on the school climate,but also on students' academic performance. TheNYC-DOE rated PS 24 \"exemplary\" in closing theachievement gap. Latino students in the lowestthird in English Language Arts rose to higher levels,and all English language learners rose to higher lev-els in mathematics. The school received a B+, one Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1Linda Lantieri \u00b7 29Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1Conclusion The United States has been the first home of the social and emotional learning movement in edu- cation in the world. At least some component ofthis approach is used in more than half of the thou-sands of schools in the U.S. Over the last decade,this humanizing wave in American education hasinspired many other parts of the world to follow. Asthis report outlines, many other countries are usingSEL curricula. Today SEL is incorporated in someform in schools under diverse titles such as \"emo-tional and emotional education,\"\"life skills,\" \"citizenship education,\" and \"charactereducation.\" In Singapore, the Ministry of Education launched a nationwide SEL program in 2006 andUNESCO formulated ten basic SEL principles 34in a statement issued in 2002 to ministries in 140 coun-tries. 35The ten basic principles are summarized here: 1. Learning requires caring.2. Teach everyday life-skills.3. Link social-emotional instruction to other school services. 4. Use goal-setting to focus instruction.5. Use varied instructional procedures.6. Promote community service to build empa- thy. 7. Involve parents.8. Build social-emotional skills gradually and systematically. 9. Prepare and support staff well.10. Evaluate what you do. The SEL movement is one of the most promising trends in education that we have witnessed in along time. It seems to be the \"missing piece\" in bol-stering academic success and preparing young peo-ple for the challenges they face in the 21st century.The challenges the movement faces now are totackle the barriers that may obstruct more wide-spread adoption. What will it take for social and emotional learn- ing to be fully incorporated into the American edu-cation system as a norm, not an exception? First,we need to get the word out. Educational leaders inour country are still largely uninformed about theresearch findings concerning the value of social andemotional learning and how best to integrate andabout to be \"high-jacked\" by strong feelings. Thenhe gave a \"put-up\" (the opposite of a put-down)to his attacker and himself, reminding them bothof something positive about each, thus levelingand elevating the encounter. The put-ups alsocued the children to the SEL teachings they werefamiliar with as well, further invoking past learn-ing about handling conflict. As a result, whatmight have been the start of days, months, oreven years of conflict between the younger boyand two older oppressors was quickly diffusedand turned into a positive encounter. Generalizing, we note that effective SEL pro- gramming, such as that at PS 24, includes: Instruction in and opportunities to practice and apply an integrated set of cognitive,affective, and behavioral skills. Learning environments characterized by trust and respectful relationships. Implementation that is coordinated and reinforces classroom, school-wide, out-of-school, and at-home learning activities. Systematic and sequential programming from preschool through every grade level. Developmentally and culturally appropriate behavioral supports. On-going monitoring and evaluation of implementation for continuous improve-ment. Currently, PS 24 is one of thousands of schools in the U.S. proving that a school does nothave to choose between promoting academicachievement and fostering good citizenship in thecontext of a caring learning community. A newvision of education that values young people'shearts and spirits as well as their minds is begin-ning to take hold. Adults and children at PS 24are partners in creating a positive school environ-ment. The children are developing their leadershipskills, and have skills in social and emotionallearning that they will use for the rest of theirlives\u2014at home, at school, on the street, at work,and as citizens. As we prepare our children to meet the chal- lenges of living and working in the 21st century,all children deserve the kind of education prac-ticed and modeled at PS 24. Our future dependson it.30 \u00b7 Social Emotional Intelligenceschool? We teach them that two and two makes four, and that Paris is the capital ofFrance. When will we also teach them whatthey are? We should say to each of them:Do you know what you are? You are a mar-vel. You are unique... And when you growup can you then harm another who is, likeyou, a marvel? You must cherish one anoth-er. You must work\u2014we all must work\u2014tomake this world worthy of its children. References 1. Foster, S., Rollefson, M., Doksum, T., Noonan, D., Robinson, G., & Teich, J.

Although scientific evi-dence and know-how is available, this informationis not effectively utilized in most American schools.A strategic communications plan is needed at everylevel of American society to inform school adminis-trators, teachers, parents, and the public about thepositive short- and long-term impacts of SEL.CASEL needs to take a lead in publishing andbroadly disseminating reports summarizing SELprogramming impacts and to continue to update its\"consumer's guide\" of evidenced-based SEL pro-gramming. Second, in order to broadly adopt an SEL vision of education, there needs to be a model establishedto train large numbers of people to train others inthese approaches. Again CASEL's role here is essen-tial in making SEL more widespread in the U.S. Itwould be helpful, for example, for CASEL to experi-mentally evaluate their resource Sustainable Schoolwide SEL: Implementation Guide and Tool Kitand continue to provide technical assistance toother states toward SEL implementation. Currently,school personnel struggle with choosing, imple-menting, and sustaining effective SEL programs. Third, there is insufficient research and knowl- edge on how best to assess SEL outcomes. CASELneeds to play a role in further refining and field-testing rubrics for guiding and measuring SEL prac-tices and program implementation. SEL reportcards for parent-teacher- student conferences needto be designed and evaluated. Finally, in order for SEL implementation to be widespread, the actions of educators alone are notsufficient. Policy work is required to guide statesand countries to systematically and broadly imple-ment and sustain evidence-based SEL program-ming. The U.S. faces many challenges in educating its children, but we are also in a time of great hopeand possibility. The SEL framework\u2014if broadlyadopted\u2014would do much to improve the educa-tional system in the U.S. We owe it to our childrento help them be fully prepared for the challengesand opportunities that they will face.

Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1everal things that distinguish Waldorf educa- tion are unusual in education today. The first is the awareness that a human being is only fullyunderstood if we take the unseen, spiritual aspectof a child's nature into account. Another is theexplicit assumption that a teacher is required toresearch the curriculum, teaching methods, andfactors that influence the learning and develop-ment of children. Further, Waldorf education isbased on an epistemology and ontology thatacknowledge no formal limits on knowledge ofspiritual aspects of life. It is of paramount inter-est, therefore, that the methods by which thisknowledge is generated be well-known and acces-sible to teachers. A year after the founding of the Waldorf School in 1919, Rudolf Steiner, then schoolDirector, held a course for teachers in which headded new perspectives to their reflection on theirwork. He described a method that, if used consis-tently over a period of years, leads teachers to beable to grasp quickly the essence of what needs tobe done, for example, in lesson planning and inrecognizing and meeting the needs of pupils.Steiner described this as \"meditatively acquiredknowledge of the human being.\" 2This involves studying the nature of thedeveloping human being, medi-tating on this study, and then\"creative remembering.\" 3 Steiner describes the outcomeof working in this way as fol-lows: Now if you work at the study of the developinghuman like we have beendoing, you experience it consciously tostart with; yet if you subsequently medi-tate on it, an inner process of digestiongoes into your soul and spirit, making ateacher and educator of you. Just as themetabolism makes you a living person,this meditative digesting of a true study ofman makes you an educator. You simplyencounter the child in an entirely differentway when you experience the results of areal anthroposophical study of man. And ifwe keep returning to ideas like these, ifonly for five minutes a day, our wholeinner life of soul will be brought into move-ment. We shall produce so many thoughtsand feelings they will just pour out of us. Ifyou meditate on the study of man in theevening, then the next morning you willknow in a flash... what to do with this orthat pupil. 4 If we take these brief indications in terms of practitioner research methodology,5we can inter- pret them as follows. Steiner calls the first stageof this method study. If we interpret this in awider sense it includes making observations,informing ourselves of the relevant literature,reflecting on ideas about our educational task,and engaging in discourse with colleagues, all ofwhich Steiner saw as the regular activities of staffor faculty meetings. The teachers' meeting should be a \"living university for theCollege of Teachers\u2014a perma-nent training academy....\" 6In a wide sense I interpret studyto mean what would be called,in a research process, data col-lection. This could include arange of research methods,such as participant observa-tion, case or child study, inter-view, questionnaire, study of documents, or a relevant literature survey orreview\u2014in other words, the methods typical ofqualitative or interpretive research. 7 Steiner calls the next stage of this method meditation. He uses an analogy with digestion but S In a wide sense I inter- pret study to meanwhat would be called,in a research process,data collection. Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1 Rudolf Steiner's Research Methods for Teachers1 Martyn Rawson34 \u00b7 Rudolf Steiner's Research Methods for Teachers Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1does not give precise instructions. The phrase \"meditate on\" suggests a form of reflection andcontemplation, and it suggests regular practice.The analogy with digestion, however, requires aprocess of repeated forgetting\u2014we are aware ofour food's taste and texture as we eat it, but then,thankfully, we are normally unconscious of it dur-ing digestion. Perhaps what Steiner meant wassomething along the lines of what Schmuckdescribes as professional self-reflection or \"self-focused meditation that includes visualizing whereyou are, where you have been, and where youmight go.\" 8Steiner emphasizes the element of repeated practice. The third stage following this meditative understanding is creative remembering,9by which I believe Steiner means the process by which prac-tice is illuminated not only by what we haveunderstood but by what expresses itself as intu-ition. It is the art of doing the right thing at theright time. Lutzker has recently discussed the liter-ature on intuition in teaching, especially bySch\u00f6n. 10Kiersch has stressed that it is important to bear in mind that this process of creativeremembering is not \"the normal rememberingwith the help of which concrete pedagogicalactions can be logically based on anthroposophi-cal insights. What is meant here is 'receivingsomething inwardly' from the supersensible-spiri-tual realm of intuition.\" 11 This process of rememberingis akin to \"thinking observa-tion.\" In the process of medita- tively acquired knowledge ofthe developing human being,which may be called the med- itative reflection method, we recognize Steiner's epistemol-ogy in the steps by which we acquire knowledgeof the world. Steiner posited two sources of gener-ating knowledge: what we perceive of the worldthrough our senses and what we can grasp in theform of ideas and concepts in the act of thinking.In thinking, the human being has access to univer-sal truths. In perceiving, we construct an empiricalview of the world that is necessarily subjective.The world reveals itself, according to Steiner, inthe human mind, or, as he also put it, the soul.The soul is the stage upon which cosmic eventsunfold and in which we are not impassiveobservers but active co-creators, as Steiner put itin his doctoral thesis, Truth and Science. We change what we perceive and we are changed bythe process. 12 What is explicitly missing in Steiner's method of meditative reflection, though it is amply sup-ported implicitly, is the need to reflect on the actsof intuition and their consequences in practice.This is crucial if this method is to meet criticalstandards of research. 13Each individual teacher must engage in such reflection, for example, inreviewing lessons, and it must also occur in dis-course with fellow teachers. The whole process aims at revealing some- thing of the being of the phenomenon and thisinsight provides a basis for meaningful engage-ment and action. The question is, what comes toexpression through the data, through our percep-tions, and how do we experience it? Only thisquestion leads to a provisional idea of the being ofthe phenomenon. MeditationasContemplativeInquiry Meditation may be an unusual form of research, but if we focus on the aspect of research thatrequires us to think about the phenomena thatinterest us, then we may agree on the importanceof the quality of this thinking. Meditation may be called an enhancement of think-ing processes, a concentrationof focus on the phenomena,and a mental discipline. In themethod described above, medi-tation has two essential quali-ties: repeated, focused contem-plation and forgetting.Forgetting means \"letting go\"and allowing the contents of mental images and thoughts to sink out of con-sciousness; the focus of our attention shifts else-where, for example, or we fall asleep. Steiner sug-gested that ideas and experiences continue to beprocessed in the unconscious mind, and modernbrain research confirms this. 14Ideas, experiences, and even abilities are changed and enhanced aftera period of unconsciousness. In recent years there has been dialogue between brain science and meditation. A recentpublication records the dialogue between promi-Ideas, experiences, and even abilities arechanged and enhancedafter a period of uncon-sciousness.nent neurologist Wolf Singer, director of the Max- Planck Institute for Neurology, Frankfurt, andMatthieu, a Buddhist monk and former molecularscientist: WS: It appears that you are using your intentional control system to activate inter-nal representations, to focus your attentionon these and to work with them as if youwere dealing with information from out-side, quite as if the attention directing cog-nitive abilities of the brain were being usedto explore the inner world. Perhaps the abil-ity to distinguish and to perceive theseprocesses is increased through the focusingof attention on the inner processes in justthe same way as when our attention isfocused on events in the outer world. Couldit be that through meditation the percep-tion of inner states is simply sharpened? MR: ...or perhaps only the meta- consciousness for a state that you want todevelop further, such as empathy... WS: ...with the intention of stabilizing these mental states ... MR: ...to maintain the state of medita- tion from moment to moment... WS: ...to hold the focus of attention on certain innerstates, which may be emo-tions of the contents of men-tal images. In principle thiswould mean using the samestrategy as we use when wefocus on a certain segment ofthe outer world or when wewant to concentrate on a cer-tain activity\u2014except thatmost of us are less familiarwith this strategy of focusingon inner states.... MR: That conforms with the definition of meditation, to cultivate acertain mental state or spiritual state, with-out being distracted. 15 Following this description of the effect of med- itation, we can see that, with practice, it is possi-ble to focus on inner processes, be they thoughtsor feelings, or data we have collected and struc-tured, in the same way that an empiricist focuseson the external world. This would be a kind ofinner empiricism, or, as Goethe called it,anschauende Urteilskraft \u2014forming through contemplation. This is what Steiner called\"exact imagination,\" focusing our open-mindedattention on mental phenomena and processesand observing how they unfold, how they revealthemselves, and how they affect us. 16 The physicist Arthur Zajonc has recently described a method of \"contemplative inquiry\"that has much in common with the meditativereflection I have described. 17Drawing on a wide range of traditions and practices\u2014Zen Buddhism,Sufism, Jesuit meditation, the idealism of Goetheand Steiner, and the Romantic era, includingColeridge and Emerson\u2014Zajonc has made thecase that, with suitable inner preparation, aresearcher can attain heightened levels of con-sciousness that can enhance our perceptual andcognitive abilities. In creating an inner space ofstillness and focus the mind can become morereceptive and clear. Indeed, the creation of thecontemplative mood or consciousness, while ini-tially turning inward, can also be a preparationfor greater awareness when attention is directedinto the world. As Zajonc puts it, In meditation we move between focused and openattention.... After a period ofvivid concentration on thecontent of meditation, thecontent is released. Thatwhich is held is gone. Ourattention opens. We areentirely present. An interiorpsychic space has beenintently prepared and weremain in that space. Wewait, not expecting, not hop-ing, but present to welcome whatever may or may not arise withininfinite stillness. 18 Zajonc calls this process the breathing of attention or cognitive breathing. First, the medi-tant focuses on a content; he or she then emptiesthe mind to create an inner space in which activi-ties and relationship\u2014rather than the outer Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1Meditation may be called an enhance-ment of thinkingprocesses, a concen-tration focus onthe disci-pline.Martyn Rawson \u00b7 3536 \u00b7 Rudolf Steiner's Research Methods for Teachers Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1forms\u2014can reveal themselves. This path does not lead away from the world of the senses, the worldof observation and empirical experience, butrather opens the mind to the inner complexity oflife. \"Meditation is a schooling for experiencinglife from the inside.\" 19 This point has much in common with Barfield's con-cept of \"participation.\" OwenBarfield, the English philoso-pher and linguist, has beencalled a prophet of the post-modern 20by virtue of his cri- tique of positivism, first stat-ed in the 1920s, and hisrecognition of the role of lan-guage in knowledge creation.Barfield's chief concern was the loss of meaning ina materialistic age. In numerous works on lan-guage he charted the evolution of human con-sciousness. He characterized the consciousness ofmodern times as marked by the \"trauma of mate-rialism.\" Materialism for Barfield meant \"takingmaterial objects of perception as what is reallyreal rather than as products of the act of percep-tion.\" 21 Barfield saw, in what he called the \"idolatry\" of perception, the habit of taking the world atface value, as something given, without furtherlevels of meaning, and requiring no further activi-ty on the part of the perceiver. 22For Barfield, the act of perception was not a passive taking in ofwhat already existed out there. Rather, perceptionwas actively generated. In the course of culturalevolution, human beings progressively lost theirability to directly experience reality as both theirunderstanding of the world and their languagebecame more abstract. Thus, people lost theirability to derive meaning from their perception ofthe world. Metaphors began to replace directexperience. \"Reality, once self-evident, and there-fore not conceptually experienced, but which cannow be reached only by effort of the individualmind\u2014this is what is contained in a true poeticmetaphor.\" 23 Only in what Barfield termed \"poetic diction\"24do we approach a state of what he calledparticipation, in which our apprehension of reality is direct. The way to overcome idolatry andthe trauma of materialism is to strive toward anew form of participation through thinking.Barfield drew on the distinction between natura naturata\u2014\"nature natured\"\u2014and natura naturans\u2014\"nature naturing\"\u2014to distinguishbetween inert objects perceived in the world andthe activities and processes that bring them into being. Through developing anew consciousness\u2014one thatwe still have access to inmetaphor and poetic diction\u2014we can participate in or experi-ence that activity directly. Thetrauma of modern materialismor modern positivism is inbelieving that the world we per-ceive passively as natura natura- tais all there is. Like Goethe and Steiner, Barfield sought the activity within life through an active process ofknowledge creation. For Barfield, the path to thereality within the world lay, for the modern mind,in imagination, in \"poetic diction.\" Like Steiner, Barfield often used the terms con- sciousness andspiritsynonymously. Consciousness for both was a property in its own right, like ener-gy or light. Full consciousness was, for Steiner, fullawareness of all dimensions of reality, materialand spiritual, outer appearance and being. Meditative reflection is a process that shifts our awareness from external appearances to theprocess level of reality, to what Zajonc calls \"thedomain of activity and relationship in whicheverything is relationship and movement, every-thing is shifting from potential to actual and backagain. And agency/being stands behind it all.\" 25 To build on Zajonc's and Barfield's contribu- tions, we can see a bridge between meditativereflection and the creation of an imaginativeimage or an intuition. I look into the world andperceive with my senses. I form mental imagescorresponding to what I experience. In meditating,I open myself to processes underlying the world Iperceive. I can do this because these sameprocesses are active within me, both as the forma-tive forces of my body and as the formativeprocesses of my cognition. 26 These processes may or may not be progres- sively revealed to me in my thinking\u2014meditationis not a process that can be forced. If they doreveal themselves to my mind, I can express andsummarize what I now experience in the form ofan image, a picture, a motif, a metaphor, or a con-Intuition progressively becomes an ability, askill we can apply tounderstand the worldwhile we are workingwithin it.Martyn Rawson \u00b7 37 Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1cept. That is to say, the sum of my experience is artistically integrated into an image that has amore general character than the specific instancethat prompted it. This image or complex conceptmay have a multilayered meaning, like a picture,and it expresses something of the essence of whatI see and experience. I \"know\" how to read the\"pictures\" and can interpret them, just as ananthroposophical doctor may understand his orher patient and prescribe a specific therapy orremedy. The doctor weighs evidence and forms ajudgment based on a \"picture\" of the individualand the illness. This is whatSteiner described when hesaid the teacher will know ina few moments what thepupils need and what thepedagogical approachshould be. Intuition ariseshere out of the participationof the observer in theprocess of what is observed.Both are altered by the expe-rience and this, too, is part of the nature of intu-ition. Intuition is not merely a bright idea thatoccurs to us; it activates our being in a more pro-found sense. Further, intuition progressivelybecomes an ability, a skill we can apply to under-stand the world while we are working within it. TeacherasResearcherandLearner: KnowledgeinContext Meditative reflection is essentially an enhance- ment of the process of learning and involvesdevelopment of specific competences that teach-ers need in order to observe and \"read\" children,and to then reflect on subsequent thoughts, feel-ings, and actions. Such competence is notacquired quickly or during initial teacher educa-tion, but involves skills acquired through practice.In particular, practitioner research is a process ofdevelopment from novice to expert. 27Ingold calls this process enskilment , which he characterizes as a process of observation and reflection embeddedin a context of practical engagement with theworld. 28Following the socio-cultural approach of Sch\u00f6n29and Lave and Wenger,30teaching as an art is skilled practice that relies for its furtherdevelopment on a process of knowing in practice.It also requires the kind of active reflection thatIngold calls imagination. 31Further, as Kelly says, \"the process of know- ing-in-practice does not reside within individuals;rather it is distributed across teachers, students,and both conceptual artifacts such as models andtheories, and physical artifacts such as books andcomputers.\" 32This perspective is both reassuring and challenging for teachers who feel alone in theclassroom but who wish to conform with Steiner'sview that discourse among teachers is essential,that a \"living academy\" should meet weekly tofacilitate, we may say, knowing-in-practice. This perspective also sheds light on the nature of meditative research, whichby its nature is individual. Oneof the preconditions for raisingmeditative reflective practiceto the level of research is thestep to collegial discourse andthe recognition that eachschool has a culture. Thisschool culture is more than thesum of knowledge possessedby each member of the school, and it \"pertains not to precise situations but tothe particular working practices and their associ-ated ways of knowing and thinking which defineparticular school circumstances.\" 33Thus Kelly describes the context of teacher learning and thecreation of teacher expertise. The implications ofthis for the meditative reflective method are thatdiscourse among colleagues is part of the processand that understanding occurs in the context ofconsciousness for a specific school as a learningorganization. 34 Building on Vygotsky's social constructivist theory,35which sees learning as the motor of development and the creation of knowledge asessentially collaborative, Wells sees knowledge asemergent, contextual, and, above all, dialogic. Hedescribes knowledge as ...the enhanced understanding of the problem situation gained by the partici-pants, on the one hand, and the represen-tation of that understanding that is pro-duced in the process, on the other.Furthermore, neither the participants'understanding nor the knowledge repre-sentation can be appropriated by othersunless they too engage in some compara-ble problem solving. 36Knowledge is not a thing that one can possess and give to others, but rathera process in which onemay engage.Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1of enhancing intuitive processes through medi- tative work. To this end, I have developed amethod that combines Steiner's meditativelyacquired knowledge and Zajonc's contemplativeinquiry. Participants are asked to record person-al reflections on the experience as well as theoutcomes of discourse with colleagues. Thework is at an early stage but initial results areencouraging. I see this work and research as animportant aspect not only of Waldorf educationbut of education in any context. To this end Iam also working with colleagues outside ofWaldorf education. As da Viega points out, the \"ongoing revi- sion and evaluation of educational practicethrough observation and through scientificresearch and taking into account the anthropo-logical, biological, and social changes whichhave occurred\" 41is essential to the continuing professional development of Waldorf educationand its practitioners. This research should alsoinclude research into practitioner research meth-ods, including those based on anthroposophy.Knowledge in this sense is not a thingthat one can possess and give to others, but rather aprocess in which one may engage. Knowledge iscreated as an active deed and, as Wells sees it,this process is essentially collaborative. In dia-logue\u2014which also includes self-dialogue in think-ing\u2014active partners create knowledge. Learning,as Lave and Wenger point out, is not a separateand independent activity in life but an integralpart of interaction with the world and with otherswithin a \"community of practice.\" 37 What Wells calls \"dialogic inquiry\" is not only a method of classroom knowledge-building; it isalso a primary research method. Further, in con-trast to conventional research methods, in whicha theory is posited, tested algorithmically, andthen applied\u2014which as Ingold has shown sepa-rates the activities of knowing and of doing 38\u2014 knowledge grows in a specific context throughdialogue. EnhancingEducationalResearch Both Steiner's meditative reflective method andZajonc's contemplative inquiry can enhance allprocesses in the daily or weekly cycle of teaching,including planning, acting (e.g., teaching), review-ing, studying, and discoursing. Both approachessupport the process of intuition and, practicedregularly, help to sustain the development of skillsthat belong to teacher learning and the acquisi-tion of expertise. To raise this activity to the sta-tus of research, the key is the quality of criticalreflection after the event. I follow Wellington's definition of educational research, 39in which he follows Stenhouse40in describing research as systematic, critical, andself-critical inquiry that aims to contribute to theadvancement of knowledge. I add Stenhouse'sbasic maxim, that practitioner research is aimednot only at understanding learning and teachingbut improving them as well. I am currently investigating, in a range of educational and therapeutic settings, theextent to which a method of meditative reflec-tion can be embedded into a cycle of practi-tioners' learning with the aim of enhancingprofessional learning. Initial outcomes haveestablished that many practitioners recognizethe value of intuition in their professionaljudgment and are interested in exploring ways38 \u00b7 Rudolf Steiner's Research Methods for Teachers40.

(Stockmeyer, 1991) As an alternative to the now-pervasive stan- dard of a grade-by-grade curriculum that wasintroduced to North America in the mid-19th cen-tury, students of different grade levels may befound in a single class. Although the conceptsvary by name and detail, for clarity here theterms combined grades and multiage classroomswill be used to discuss two generally distinctapproaches to teaching children of differing agesin one classroom. The reasons for assigning thesestudents to a single class and the measures ofeducational achievement are distinguishing fea-tures of these approaches. Grades are often combined because of admin- istrative, enrollment, or economic constraints.Combined grades classrooms serve students whoare in the same classroom but who receive cur-riculum at grade level, with two or more curriculataught in one classroom. Although teachers havepersonal intentions for the overall health of theirclassrooms, graded curriculum objectives havebecome increasingly focused on academic achieve-ment. By contrast, multiage classrooms growfrom a pedagogical foundation and have a broad-er view of educational success. To serve studentsin a multiage classroom, the teacher does notteach based on grade level. Instead, some of thepriorities of a multiage classroom, based on myresearch, are these:Introduction In Waldorf schools, combining grades is a conces- sion, not a design choice. Low or decreased enroll-ment is often the cause for combining grades.Lower birthrates, limited population, geography,economy, and attrition can lead to decreasedenrollment. Regardless of the causes, however, aschool may continue a given class for many rea-sons, including responsibility for and loyalty to stu-dents and parents. This study, a look at combined grades class- rooms in Waldorf schools, necessarily takes intoaccount that Rudolf Steiner's indications for teach-ing were made regarding an educational system ofage-based grade levels and that most Waldorfschools are designed on this principle. Thus, mostof the educational literature available on the topic isnot based in the literature of Waldorf education. Iused educational literature, interviews with teach-ers, questionnaires, and classroom observation togain an improved understanding of combined gradeclassrooms both in general and specifically withregard to using Steiner's educational ideas in cir-cumstances that differ from those in which the firstWaldorf schools took root. I contacted schools known to have combined grades or multiage classes and individuals who hadrelevant teaching experience. I interviewed elevenWaldorf school teachers and four Montessori schoolteachers; another four Waldorf school teachers pro-vided questionnaire responses. I also interviewedone Montessori and two Waldorf school administra-tors and observed six combined grades classroomsin Waldorf schools and four Montessori multiageclassrooms. All of the Waldorf teachers interviewedfor this study considered their classrooms to be\"combined grades.\" The four Montessori teachersadvocate the \"multiage\" approach based on theirown work and on established standards forMontessori schools. It is interesting to note that twoof the teachers from the Montessori schools hadbackgrounds in Waldorf education\u2014one was for-mally trained as a Waldorf teacher and anotherwas a Waldorf school graduate.Combined Grades in Waldorf Schools: Creating Classrooms Teachers Can Feel Good About Lori L. Freer To use developmentally appropriate prac- tices and support the learning continuum. To develop the whole child and help chil- dren enjoy learning. To use the process approach to learning and build on each child's successes. To use varied instructional strategies within an integrated curriculum. To choose a curriculum based on interest and need. To develop individual potentialities to the maximum. To evaluate each learner on past achieve- ments and individual potential. To encourage noncompetitive, cooperative social interaction. To establish one teacher for several years. To promote professional parent partner- ships. Much of what is done in Waldorf schools is consistent with what is described as \"best prac- tices\" in the multiage setting. This work, ideally,avoids competition among learners infavor of cooperation andsupport, acknowledges dif-fering perspectives as fosters experimentation,and problem solving.Sandra Stone (1996) com-pares the primarily academic focus of contempo-rary single grade education with multiage peda-gogy when she states that \"social, emotional, andmoral learning are just as important as learninghow to read.\" Both multi-grade structures and Waldorf schools use methods that reflect a \"constructivist\"philosophy, meaning that knowledge is builtthrough the work of teachers and students, ratherthan merely transmitted by teachers andabsorbed by students. To this end, a progressionleads children to discovery. According to AlfieKohn (1999), \"We form beliefs, build theories,make order. We act on the environment ratherthan responding to it\u2014we do it naturally andcontinually. It's part of who we are.\" Teacherobservations, involvement, and inspiration arerequired to create conditions for student discovery.The goal of allowing freedom to discover recognizesthe motivational value of trust in the classroom,and, rather than a grading system, close observa-tion of the student and authentic assessment arepracticed in order to offer personal and creativeleadership. WhatDoStudiesSay? The results of available studies generally indicate that on achievement tests studentsperform just as well or even better thanthose in single-grade classes. (Gayfer, 1991) Studies looking at affective indicators of stu- dent success abound, and these often specify bothindividual and group benefits. Being in a more age-diverse social group allows for more varied and nat-ural associations that help children within and out-side of school. Nevertheless, in our increasingly lit-erate and educated society, cognitive developmenttends to take priority, so whether or not such class-rooms promote academic success is a crucial ques-tion. Do multiage or combined grades classrooms promote academic success?The answer is overwhelmingly\"yes.\" In one study of 4,407students, Joel Gajadharsingh(in Gayfer, 1991) found that\"achievement of high-er in vocabulary, reading,mathematics problem-solvingand mathematics total.\" In a smaller study of 418 students, researchers conclud-ed that \"there is an 80% chance that the achieve-ment of multi-grade students is equal or superior tothat of students in single grades.\" (Gayfer, 1991) ObstaclestoCombinedGradesClasses: CulturalConceptions Despite studies that demonstrate that multiage and combined grades classrooms are good for students,unfortunately parents, teachers, and administratorstend to oppose them. The concept of combininggrades has negative connotations for many people,and this attitude extends to multiage classrooms aswell. Some reject these as throwback to the one-room schoolhouse, as antithetical to progress, orout of concern that they will not meet grade-by-grade curriculum standards.Do multiage or combined grades classrooms pro-mote academic success?The answer is over-whelmingly \"yes.\" Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #142 \u00b7 Combined Grades in Waldorf SchoolsA Canadian study includes research on atti- tudes about combined grades classrooms: Even though students in multi-grade classes do as well as, and in some cases better than, students in single grade class-es, the parents and teachers do not acceptthis fact. A further implication is that par-ents and teachers had not received any pos-itive statements about multi-grading, andthat most publicity was negative, inaccu-rate, or misleading. (Gayfer, 1991) Sometimes this negative view is overcome through education about and marketing of a pro- gram. Montessori education has carved out a placefor itself among those seeking alternative educationdespite three-year student age ranges in each of theelementary, middle, and upperschool classrooms. According tothe Association of MontessoriInternationale website, there are170 affiliated schools in the U.S.Private schools tend to be seenas elite and, through careful rep-resentation of their benefits, ableto create a strong but limited fol-lowing. Montessori and a fewindependent schools are notableexceptions to the general culturalopposition to combining childrenof differing grade levels in a single class. Teacher education according to a graded stan- dard creates teachers who are ill-prepared (andoften poorly supported) for the task of combinedgrades, and this lack of training can reinforce a neg-ative mind-set. Teachers who are neither fortifiedby training nor have a sound philosophical founda-tion from which to teach can find it difficult toembrace the task. Although a few years ago therewere continuing education programs and work-shops available for teachers working with multiagepedagogy, currently it is difficult to find anyoneproviding such support. None of my questionnairerespondents were aware of any training for teach-ing in a combined-grades classroom save for stan-dard Montessori training. Additionally, severalexperts and authors in the field of multiage educa-tion (not Montessori) could point to no currentlyavailable resources beyond published studies.WaldorfSchoolConceptions Beyond the cultural backdrop of pervasive nega- tive attitudes about combined grades and multi-age classrooms, Waldorf school teachers mayhave additional psychological and social filtersformed in their own teacher education, as well asthose of their peer group, including those of theAssociation of Waldorf Schools of North America(AWSNA). (Baertges, 2009) Advocates of Waldorfeducation question whether developmental cur-riculum guidelines can be met within a structureof combined grades. In light of multiage peda-gogy, a main point of departure for Waldorfteachers is that Steiner related the structure ofchild development to age, whereas the multiageapproach sees child development as progressingthrough stages in an individual, and these stagesare not necessarily so tightly age related. Steiner's developmental tasks, related toage, do not stop with child devel-opment, but rather continue asseven-year cycles throughout ahuman lifespan (Steiner, 1907),making development part of anall-encompassing philosophythat teachers are loathe to misin-terpret or disregard. To complicate matters, an ongoing discourse comparingWaldorf and Montessori meth-ods tends to be prejudiced according to the author or speaker. This seeminglycompetitive positioning of the two approachesmay influence a Waldorf teacher's unwillingnessto embrace what may be perceived as aMontessori technique. TeachingApproaches If one has an eye on human health and human development, then this makes pos-sible correct classroom and educationalpractice.... The Waldorf school is, inmany aspects, completely built on com-promises; this fact we do not want todeny. However, only as it is possible todaydo we educate and teach in the sense of atrue knowledge of the human being. (InRiccio, 2002) Waldorf school teachers approach their com- bined grades in different ways. Most find them-Combining grades can allow theteacher to form alarge enough groupto be dynamic andto embody the socialaspects of Waldorfeducation.

Freer \u00b7 43selves either alone in the task or supported by a faculty group that is trying to make the most outof less-than-desirable conditions. A few teachershave been consistently at this task for years\u2014observing, cultivating, and tending a schooldesign that has grown into a complex organismthat blooms in their com-munity year after year.Several teachers, forinstance, stated that theirschools have found value inkeeping Grade 1 as a singlegrade classroom and begin-ning to combine classesstarting in Grade 2. Below, compiled from interviews and question-naires, are four ways toaddress the needs of com-bined grades in Waldorfschools. These constructsare not mutually exclusive, but constitute a vari-ety of tools that teachers use to manage theirclassrooms. Parenthetical comments about gradesreflect specific suggestions of the respondents. StrategiesforCombined-Grades TeachinginWaldorfSchools 1) Separate students for main lessons: a) Grade-specific main lessons provided by dif- ferent teachers at the usual time. b) Alternate timing of grade-based main lessons. 2) Group students by ability or as needed: a) Group by grade for main lesson when the cur- riculum poses a particularly difficult combi- nation of topics (blocks for Grades 2 and 3were noted). b) Split the class for math work (Grades 3 and 4 were noted). c) Split the class for math and language arts (starting in Grade 5 was noted). d) Use creative grouping and splitting. 3) Use an alternate school calendar: a) Time the school year by teaching as if you start in the northern hemisphere and migrateto the southern hemisphere\u2014the calendarand school years match more closely in thesouthern hemisphere (e.g., January-Junestarts a new grade; fall continues this work).In practice, this involves beginning the yearwith the lower grade's blocks and proceedingto the next grade's blocks after the winterbreak. 4) Use a homeschool or individual approach: a) In a small class, a homeschool approach can teach each student one by one. Splitting a class by grade for main lesson does not haveto create a feeling of distinctclass levels. The two-teacher(or teacher-with-assistant)approach can be used as anongoing solution or for assur-ing that all students workthrough certain blocks at agiven age but do not have torepeat them the following year.These groupings may be strict-ly based on age indicators oron needs observed by teachers. Three teachers interviewed said that they consid-ered the \"soul need,\" as distinct from the chronolog-ical age, of the child as a partial indicator of stu-dent readiness for a topic of study. Teachers lookedcarefully at topics with regard to the specific chil-dren and ages represented in their classrooms. Ateacher with a combined class of first and secondgraders, for example, deemed fables and animaltales appropriate for the second half of first grade,but felt that she would not teach more emotionallyand spiritually advanced stories like those of sagesand saints until the beginning of the next schoolyear. It takes careful planning to make the topics from the curriculum fresh for students who havealready begun particular grade-level work the previ-ous year. Students and parents complained whenone teacher ended a school year with Hebrew sto-ries and continued to study Hebrew stories whenstudents returned in the fall. Following curriculumindications with students of more varied agesrequires the diligence of teachers to examine contin-ually and carefully the effects of their work. Thisdiligence is weightier but easier to achieve in aWaldorf school, since teachers continue with stu-dents and their families for several years. Oneknowledgeable teacher is responsible for the pro-gression and integrity of the children's education. Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1Combining ages and grades in Waldorf schoolclassrooms need not beseen as conflicting withSteiner's indications, butmay be seen as a call tomeet them from a freshperspective.44 \u00b7 Combined Grades in Waldorf SchoolsBenefitsofCombinedGrades inWaldorfSchools The margin between the challenged and the intelligent pupils which, on 24th July 1920, Steiner called a makeshift arrangement,would hardly become wider by putting class-es together, but the working together of olderand younger pupils which Steiner thought tobe beneficial could come into full play. (Stockmeyer, 1991) Although most Waldorf school teachers consid- er teaching a combined grades class in a Waldorfsetting to be less desirable than teaching a singlegrade class, respondents noted several benefits.Combining grades can allow the teacher to form alarge enough group to be dynamic and to embodythe social aspects of Waldorf education. There isnaturalness about being part of a varied age groupwith people of different stages of developmentworking together. Many teachers enjoyed their stu-dents' accomplishments and their subsequent abili-ty to support or guide others. Ideal class sizedepends on many factors, but, generally, respon-dents noted that a combined class should not enrollmore students than a single grade equivalent. Some benefits were considered to be so impor- tant that teachers stated that they would seek outways to incorporate them into their classroomseven in a single-grade situation. A few teachers feltstrongly that the benefits of teaching combinedgrades outweighed the dictate of a single-grade phi-losophy. These included the sense that the creativi-ty involved in teaching was even more stronglydrawn upon to meet the needs of their studentsthan it would be in a single-grade experience.Below are other aspects that teachers appreciated: 1) Mentorship a) Teacher authority takes its place in a natural hierarchy that includes student achievement and shifting roles in the classroom. b) Older students take pride in modeling achieve- ment, attitude, and behavior, and they feelresponsible for the younger ones. c) Younger students look up to the older students and anticipate future participation in next-levelactivities.d) Student activities can be based on age or abil- ity; flexible groupings support individualswithout creating stigma. e) Mentorship is cultivated\u2014children enjoy shar- ing their strengths and skills. 2) Diversity a) Students can be grouped depending on needsand preferences (teacher or student-designated),and children generally choose their own group- ings well. b) Learning experiences and challenges shift due to diversity. c) Some work can \"level the playing field\" and unite the class, such as cooking, games, andfestivals. d) Regardless of the topic of study, everyone can celebrate holidays. e) The habit of integrating differences helps stu- dents \"not to form a pack that singles itselfout\" or is singled out. f) Uniformity of development does not always fit the student's age\u2014individuals can displaysoul needs (assessed by faculty and other sup-port) that are inconsistent with calendar age. g) One teacher says, \"Like a rainbow, combined grades classes are more colorful, more beauti-ful, with a greater combination and integra-tion of ages.\" 3) Attitudes and abilities a) Students learn to work independently.b) Multiage can serve high-needs students bet- ter\u2014they can participate without feeling outof place. c) Students learn patience and tolerance. In summary, the Waldorf school teachers who saw a combined grades classroom as a creativechallenge and found pedagogical support (ratherthan overwhelming conflict) in Steiner's indica-tions seemed to agree with Gajadharsingh. \"Theteacher who rises to the challenge and who hasmotivated pupils finds the multi-program class hasa revitalizing effect.\" (Gayfer, 1991) Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1Lori L.

One participant men- tioned that the power of the teacher's thinkingaffects the child's doing and the teacher's actionsaffect life. He posited that if theteacher's etheric and astral bodies had processedthe work and rested, they would be prepared tobring the material freshly to the student; if, howev-er, the teacher was at odds with the work at hand,or felt overwhelmed by it, the children would feel itand would respond accordingly. Another teacher who instructs six children ranging in age from seven through eleven (grades 1-5) says that she pictures angels covering the ears ofthe younger students when she is delivering lessonsto the older ones; the younger students happilywork together on their projects and do not seem tobe affected by the lesson presented to their class-mates. This teacher says that she considers herwork to be a joy, that \"all flows and fits perfectly.\" As general advice, the following comments were offered by experienced combined gradesWaldorf school teachers: 1) Classroom Management a) Nurture the spirit of community.b) Give students the experiences of being both the older and the younger students in groupings. c) Putting older students in charge is great for the classroom energy\u2014they can assist in circle(taking a leadership role), help with ideas formath and grammar work, and be a supportperson. d) Ban the word \"bored\" and cultivate creative self-direction. e) Help each student to choose an on-going \"inde- pendent study\" topic so he or she may effec-tively use extra time. 2) Material Considerations a) Seek resources, including workbooks, teaching assistant, logistical options. b) Two-sided rolling chalkboards can work as a room divider. c) A small connected room can help.d) It is useful to have lots of nooks or work sta- tions. e) Have plenty of work available for students.f) Assignments for students may be photocopied.g) Key Curriculum Press series for math is useful.AdvicefromTeachers The school's philosophy becomes the com- pass for staying the mission's course. (Grant, 1996) Educational literature suggests that multiage programs select students with care, as this is criti-cal to the success and quality of teaching withinthis model. Referring to classroom compositionthe authors of Our Best Advice, The Multiage Problem Solving Handbook state, \"This is the one very important aspect that must not be left tochance.\" (Grant, 1996) Commentary from Waldorf school teachers echoes this consideration and provides counsel.Classrooms must be carefully balanced withoutover-representing students who require remedialwork and, on the other hand, a teacher must takecare not to tax an academically advanced childthrough inappropriate grouping by achievementlevel. Work should feel doable to students. Morepractice work, homework, and challenge workmay be given to more advanced students.Additionally, the teacher may want to considerthe balance of temperaments when grouping oreven when admitting new students. Several Waldorf school teachers recommend- ed avoiding reference to student grade ranking, asit divides the class into age-based groupings thatmay not serve the classroom community. Oneteacher felt that grade differentiation gives themessage that they only half belong. When choos-ing curriculum components, one needs to focus onwhat most defines the year(s) and work out theblock rotation according to student readiness andother factors. One teacher says that her studentsget all of some of the Grade 4 curriculum and allof some of the Grade 5 curriculum\u2014she avoidsfragmenting the blocks to try to fit them all in. Inthe case of altering the curriculum delivery formixed ages, it is important that the teacher has aplan that offers its own integrity. Above all, teachers who participated in this work considered the teacher's own spiritual andpersonal development as important. Planning welland opening up to and trusting the creativeprocess work for them and reduce fear and con-trol issues that drain energy. Since they are not a part of traditional Waldorf schools, combined classes require inner46 \u00b7 Combined Grades in Waldorf Schoolsmised education, and no one wants the education of their own children to be administered in a waythat feels sub-standard. Administrative structuremay indeed hold on to tenets that represent anidealized model, but it should not adversely affectthe ability of a school or a teacher to teach chil-dren. Combining ages and grades in Waldorf school classrooms need not be seen as conflicting withSteiner's indications, but may be seen as a call tomeet them from a fresh perspective. A practice ofastute observation, cultivation of inner life, andcreative teaching are central to Steiner's instruc-tion for teachers. To see combining grades as a compromise is to support these teachers less. To insist on largeror more urban Waldorf schools is to restrictSteiner education to those places where materialsupport allows only one view of it; this, too, is acompromise. As a movement toward localizationtakes hold, the time is ripe to find ways to rein-force the creative implementation of Steiner'smethods.A Study of Small Schools and Combined Grades in Finland (Peifila,1978) states that \"preser- vation of schools in sparsely populated areas isconsidered a better solution than school systemsin population agglomerates.\" Steiner's comment on plants provides an anal- ogy for the growth of Waldorf schools on differentcontinents and in different times: But I cannot carry a plant about all over the place; it will not remain the same.Its nature is only complete in conjunctionwith the soil, with the forces that springfrom the earth, and with all the forces ofthe sun which fall upon this particularportion of the earth. Together with thesethe plant makes a totality. ... We musttake our start, not from the plant or theplant family, but from the landscape, thegeographical region: from an understand-ing of what the earth is in a particularplace. And the nature of plants must betreated in relation to the whole earth. (Steiner, 1922) Just as a plant thrives only in its own habitat, so too approaches to Waldorf education mustgrow according to and within their own condi-h) Flash Kids curriculum series by Harcourt Family Learning for language arts and math skills alsohelp. 3) Parent Relations a) Let parents know what might be missed from the graded curriculum and recommend booksand activities to supplement classroom work. b) Educate parents about the benefits of multiage classrooms. c) Remain in close contact with parents, particu- larly with regard to their children. d) If a child is ill-suited for the class, take action. Waldorf school teachers who were able to real- ize the benefits of having a spectrum of studentages approached their work using more of thetenets of the multiage pedagogy. These teachersgenerally focused more on the positive aspects ofteaching than on the negative aspects of combinedgrades. More profoundly, they seemed to have clearpedagogical reasons for their approach. Theseteachers were aware of the implications of thegrade-by-grade curriculum standard in Waldorfeducation, but they did not allow it to keep themfrom serving their students; instead, they relied onSteiner's indications and applied them to the best oftheir ability. Conclusion Life in its entirety is like a plant. The plantcontains not only what it offers to externallife; it also holds a future state within its hid-den depths. One who has before him a plantonly just in leaf, knows very well that aftersome time there will be flowers and fruit alsoon the leaf-bearing stem. In its hidden depthsthe plant already contains the flowers andfruit in embryo; yet by mere investigation ofwhat the plant now offers to external vision,how should one ever tell what these neworgans will look like? This can only be told byone who has learnt to know the very natureand being of the plant. (Steiner, 1907) A stronger program is built from a foundation that is educational rather than administrative.Classroom composition dictated by administrativeconvenience or economic reality promotes a senseof compromise.

Perhaps it is time that we think differ-ently or improve our understanding of the needsof these children. Investigations reveal that onaverage two per cent of a class may consist ofpupils we may call gifted. 1There are more than 200,000 students in Waldorf schoolsworldwide, 2so we may expect to find about 4,000 gifted students in Waldorf schools. Also,according to Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler, \"since highly gift-ed pupils are rarely 'easy' ones, but tend to bemore unique, also perhaps appearing to besocially 'difficult,' our first task must be to take aclear look at the phenomenon of giftednessitself.\" 3 TooSmartforSchool? Markus is now ten years old. The pedagogical- psychological authorities in Norway becameaware of him at the age of seven. One and a halfyears later, it was clear that he could not bediagnosed with Asperger's or ADHD, or anyother of the many diagnosessuggested along the way.Extensive examinations,inquiries, and investigationshave been part of Markus'slife for years now. His symp-toms? He is too smart. Hesays about himself, \"I looklike a child, but inside I amdifferent, I think.\" Schooldoes not appear to meet thischild's needs. For one thing, he is musically pre-cocious. And, as a young child, he asked ques-tions all the time, to the point of irritating thosearound him, questions for which he demandedproper, accurate answers. As a four-year-old, hewanted to hear about photosynthesis. As hisparents managed to answer one question, hewas ready with a new one. He learned quickly andwas often bored in school. Markus has no friends in school, not students, not teachers\u2014not that he has enemies. When hetries to play with other children, he is often seenas a nuisance. He does not understand them, andthey do not understand him. He frequently doesnot understand unspoken social rules. His emo-tional life has not developed at the same rate ashis intellectual life. This leads to misunderstand-ings and frustrations. He asks, \"Why do people,including my father and mother, not think theway I do?\" For his parents, it is painful not tounderstand their own child. It helped Markus's parents tremendously, however, when they learned to think of their sonas gifted. His talents themselves are not so impor-tant to them, however; they want him to enjoy hischildhood. His mother started an association,which translates from Norwegian as \"HappyGifted Children,\" and she now sees her son inter-acting with other gifted children cheerfully andcomfortably. In Norway, there are no special schools, programs, orlessons for gifted children. 4 When Markus's parents askedfor help, one authority suggest-ed that the family moveabroad. Denmark, Australia,England, Switzerland, andGermany have special classesfor gifted children; 5and, in the U.S., every state is obliged to institute a program for such students.6 WhatIsGiftedness? In the past, giftedness has been strongly associat-ed with the concept of genius. 7This connection began around the turn of the 20th century, whenpsychologists developed tests designed to meas-Educating Gifted Students in Waldorf Schools Ellen Fjeld K\u00f8ttker and Balazs Tarnai Steiner ... as that were notaddressed at home or atschool, and ... this madehim a lonely boy. Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1 Gure intelligence.8People who scored on the low end of a scale were labeled \"retarded,\"and those who scored on thehigh end were considered\"geniuses.\" The use of intelli-gence tests as the sole evalua-tion of giftedness has been seri-ously criticized in recent years,primarily such often confounded ethnicorigin, language, intellectual talent; italso includes creativity, memo-ry, motivation, physical ormanual dexterity, social skills,and artistic sensitivity. 9 More recently, the Marland Report offered a definition ofgiftedness that has been, and continues to be, theone most widely used by authorities. 10The report defines as \"gifted and talented\" those children,identified by professionally qualified persons,who, by virtue of outstanding abilities, are capa-ble of high performance in a particular area.These are children who require educational pro-grams or services beyond those provided by regu-lar school programs in order to realize their poten-tial contributions to their own self-developmentand to society. According to the Marland Report,children capable of high performance includethose with demonstrated achievement or potentialabilities in many of the following areas, solely orin combination: General intellectual abilities Specific academic aptitude Creative or productive thinking Leadership abilities Visual and performing arts Psychomotor abilities According to McClellan, an explanation of giftedness is the basis, the groundwork, uponwhich an educational curriculum for such childrenis built. Specific abilities included in a definition ofgiftedness determine the criteria used to selectchildren for a program and the services providedto those children. The abilities included in a defini-tion are, therefore, important to those who deter-mine which children are identified as gifted andwhat kinds of educational services they receive. 11 BeingExcellentatSchool orBeingGifted The Danish Association for Gifted Children creat- ed the table above to distinguish between smart or knowledgeable children and truly gifted chil-dren. GiftedorADHD? OtherPerspectivesonGiftedness Gifted children and adults are at risk of being labeled ADHD. Some may be both gifted and suf- fer from ADHD, but many are not, and it is notcurrently possible to determine whether or notthese conditions are linked. Such students mayalso exhibit the following behaviors: Anger and frustration High energy, intensity, fidgeting, impulsive- ness Individualistic, nonconforming, stubborn attitudes Emotional swings, moodiness UnderachievementSSmmaarrtt oorr GGiifftteedd cchhiillddrreenn kknnoowwlleeddggeeaabbllee cchhiillddrreenn Know the answers Ask questions Are interested Extremely curious Have good ideas Have wild ideas Work hard Do many other things and manage well Answer questions Discuss in detail and get circumstantial Are among the best in class Are ahead of the class Listen with interest Demonstrate strong attitudes and views Learn easily Know it already Have good friends Prefer adult company Are perceptive Are intense Are technically-oriented Are inventorsCopy accurately and precisely Create novel itemsEnjoy logical thinking Enjoy multifaceted and complex thoughts Take delight in school Take delight in learning Understand ideas Think abstractly Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #150 \u00b7 Educating Gifted Students in Waldorf Schools Disorganization, sloppiness, poor handwriting Forgetfulness, absentmindedness, daydreaming Low interest in detail These behaviors or characteristics may blind us to a student's giftedness. As a consequence, many gifted children may be medicated for conditions fromwhich they don't actually suffer; they may be med-icated to make their parents' and teachers' lives eas-ier. On the other hand, some claim that medicationsallow gifted children and adults to manage bore-dom or to allow the gifted to thrive in environmentsin which they otherwise might act out or whichthey might otherwise find too difficult. There is evidence that as many as half of all children with IQ scores above 130 receive below-average grades; and, in one study, 13% of highschool dropouts could belabeled gifted. In anotherstudy, 25% of children diag-nosed with ADHD tested sohighly in creativity that theyqualified for state scholarships. Unconventional intelligence may further complicate mat-ters. A student may not be ableto grasp simple mathematicaloperations, for instance, but be able to play thepiano exceptionally well. Few persons are gifted inmany areas. Labeling a child as gifted is not without its pit- falls, too. Some of these children feel that they arejudged solely on their intelligence, not on theireffort. Failure then means that they are not assmart as everyone believes. It is important, then,that teachers and parents praise children for theiractual work and efforts, not for relatively innatequalities like intelligence. Gifted Children and Schooling Generally, schools take one of two approaches in dealing with gifted children. Some are included in a\"normal\" class and receive individualized, enrichedinstruction at grade level; others are segregated andattend gifted classes. Another strategy to address giftedness is to skip grade levels, but often, schools oppose thisidea because of concerns about social-emotionalmaturation. Another possibility is to allow giftedstudents to attend higher grades for certain sub-jects. Several schools in the U.S. have \"enrichmentprograms\" for gifted students. Such programsusually take the form of enhancement rather thanacceleration. Lessons often involve more work,and children may feel punished for being smart. Many parents choose alternative education for their gifted children, and home schooling iscurrently a popular choice. Home schooling par-ents try to meet the social needs of their childrenin such activities as sports, clubs, and camps. Gifted Children in Waldorf Schools Anecdotal evidence suggests that some students leave Waldorf schools because they don't feel suf-ficiently challenged. Waldorf education, however,is based on two principles. One of these is to edu-cate according to the general laws of human development, and the other,equally important, is to edu-cate according to the individualneeds of each child. AsChristoph Lindenberg writes,\"The Waldorf school is no placefor preventing or hindering thedevelopment of intelligence.\"Rudolf Steiner himself assistedwith or taught a few classes in the first Waldorf School; two of the studentsattending his class were extremely talented inmusic. He told the faculty to change the students'course of study so that there would be more spacefor music in their schedules. Steiner describes in general how teachers may address gifted students: First of all, you must carefully ascertain whether the self-assertion of pupils whoare more gifted, and therefore more capa-ble, is justifiable or not. You must notallow their greater talent to develop intoan ambitious kind of egoism, but youshould help them using their gifts in theservice of other children. \"John is a goodboy. Look what he can do. Such people area great help to others, and I am pleasedwith you all that you have learnt so muchfrom John.\" So you begin by praising onechild and end up by praising them all! Youwill nearly always find that you can dealwith them best by combining two meth-Anecdotal evidence sug- gests that some studentsleave Waldorf schoolsbecause they don't feelsufficiently challenged. Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1Ellen Fjeld Kottker and Balazs Tarnai \u00b7 51ods. First, you must speak to them, not in front of theclass, but in private, sothat they realize that youlook through them. Theother thing is this: Youshould give such a childtasks which are beyond hispowers, and try to make itclear to him why he has to solve theseproblems that are too difficult to him. Ernst Lehrs, one of the founding teachers of the first Waldorf School, describes the followingcase. As a twelve-year-old, Alexis von Vivenotread Kant and Hegel, and, with his newly gained\"understanding,\" started to criticize the CatholicChurch. He was, therefore, forbidden to read suchliterature. His mother and he were later presentwhen Steiner was visiting an acquaintance oftheirs. Steiner told the boy about the WaldorfSchool in Stuttgart, and, some months later,Alexis joined Grade 9. He was politically interestedand engaged, and he asked Lehrs to help him toexpress in writing what was important to him.Lehrs brought this to Steiner's attention in one ofhis conferences with the teachers of the WaldorfSchool. Steiner asked first if the adults involvedhad observed how the student walked, which wasnot in a straight line. Further observations includ-ed that his hair fell down over his forehead; whenreading, he breathed irregularly; and his hand-writing was unclear. Steiner noted the boy haddifficulties in three-dimensional space and sug-gested that he should do Bothmer gymnastics,write five lines beautifully each day, and receiveother assistance. This helped the boy; he becamemore focused and attentive. Later, Steinerdescribed this boy's karma. Among other things,Steiner remarked that the last part of the boy'sprevious incarnation had now joined with thispresent one. Later, Alexis studied at Oxford andbecame an important diplomat in the SecondWorld War. In another case, the Waldorf School faculty wanted to dismiss a gifted boy because he wastoo difficult to cope with. Steiner suggested mathproblems and geometry exercises as therapy. Theyhelped. Finally, from Steiner's autobiography, we learn that he himself carried many questions as a childthat were not addressed at homeor at school, and that this madehim a lonely boy. Implications Many gifted children occupy themselves early with contentthat they can't really digest emo-tionally, often for lack of experi- ence. Such a discrepancy between special inter-ests and personal potentials can lead to isola-tion. Expectations and reality clash. This chal-lenge may be addressed by working with artbecause each work of art draws imaginationand reality closer together. We should keep inmind, too, that \"Waldorf school education isnot a pedagogical system but an art\u2014the artof awakening what is actually there within thehuman being.\" Further, according to Steiner, we have a task as teachers to be conscious of our guid-ance of a child's ego so that it does not entertoo deeply into the body, nor does it incarnateinsufficiently. If the ego is too strongly connect-ed to the body, we tend to become too orientedto the physical world. Vice versa, given a looseassociation with our bodies and surroundings,we are inclined to become impractical dream-ers. Too much or too little, this indeed is the issue at hand: to apply the right measures sothat we help each child to find balance in meet-ing his or her destiny. It is helpful, then, to seegiftedness as a process in development, as agrowth of potentialities. Gifted children mayneed a curative approach, in particular, so thatthey develop the courage necessary to take uptheir gifts. Schools contemplating the education of gifted children may consider the following con-ditions or accommodations: Earlier readiness for school Flexible grade enrollment Skipping grades Partial participation in higher grades for certain subject matters\u2014sharing mainlesson periods Individual or group support lessons Special homeworkGifted children may need a curativeapproach, in particular,so that they develop thecourage necessary totake up their gifts. Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #152 \u00b7 Educating Gifted Students in Waldorf SchoolsOpen-ended problems, tasks, and projects that can have several solutions Instruction in how gifted students may help other pupils in a class In addressing these topics, of course, we cannot lose sight of a student's social-emotional health. We know that when intelligence is emphasized and nur-tured too early, there is a danger that life forces arenot allowed to complete the physical growth of thechild healthfully. Intelligence, creativity, and other forms of gift- edness are gifts of destiny that should be respected,enhanced, and helped to grow. Intellectuality, inthis respect, is not a goal in itself. Many of ourbrightest and most creative minds may be unrecog-nized and even falsely pathologized because of alack of understanding. Recognition of giftedness asa permanent characteristic of the self and as aquestion of growth and development may help usto understand and support the whole gifted child.We will not ignore or misunderstand such a stu-dent, nor will we focus solely on that child's gifts orimmature accomplishments.

Our premise must be that one does not occur at the expense of the other, or thatone must preclude the other, but that, in main-taining both, in relationship, at the foci of ourattention, a better school is created. For me, this way of thinking can transform many of the tensions we experience. Considerthese apparently contradictory juxtapositions: material as process, depth asbreadth, or content as struc-ture. This view of conflict,which sees conflict as genera-tive, seems to me to be theappropriate one for a groupengaged in the difficult workof creating a community. Acompetitive, win-loseapproach to conflict mightwork well in an authoritarianhierarchy, but it would provebarren in a professionallearning community.Grossman et al. are emphatic that conversations among teachers in a groupmust be viewed as ends in themselves. \"As wehave tried to make clear, we do not regard dis-course as a proxy of something else but as a pow-erful achievement in itself.\" 7This point of view may indeed lie at one end of a spectrum, but any-one dedicated to the work of a professional learn-ing community needs to view discourse as neces-sary, if not sufficient. The Child Study The sections that follow contain an account of theChild Study Group at the Rudolf Steiner School inManhattan (I currently serve as Chair of thegroup). In recent years, I have grown increasinglyinterested in deepening the discourse among themembers of this long-standing professional learn-ing community. My methods of working drawheavily from the example of Jon McAlice, a co-founder of two other professional learning com-n the wide world of educational research, the hopeful concept of teacher as learner has gainedcurrency among a number of authors and pro-voked useful questions about the nature of profes-sional development for teachers. 2Called by differ- ent names, collaborative professional development and professional learning community (PLC) both refer to a way in which teachers learn with teach-ers to become better teach-ers. These kinds of initiativerecognize that collaborationis a demanding, uncomfort-able, participatory processin which teachers ulti-mately be required to takeresponsibility for eachother's learning. 3This image of what we expect from ourteachers may look exactlylike what we expect fromour students. The rewardsare potentially profound,although they are not easyto measure. A fundamental characteristic of a community that learns together is well described by thephrase essential tension. 4Drawing on the work of Engestr\u00f6m5and of Wenger,6Barab et al. describe how grappling with apparent dichotomies movesa community of practitioners forward. What isimportant is not the resolution of a particular con-flict, and certainly not a resolution that lands onone side or the other. Rather, as Grossman et al.describe, in an essential tension two foci are\"brought into relation\" with each other andthrough this relationship generate growth. Theyare at pains to specify that ideas such as \"com-bine\" and \"integrate\" are unable to describe thedynamic, creative interplay of poles within a com-munity. Teacher as learner is a prime example of this kind of essential tension: In a school whosevery purpose must be for student learning, howdo we bring attention to the learning of the adultsOur Child Study Group has these three purposes: tounderstand and better meetthe needs of individual stu-dents school; to deep-en the participants' under-standing of anthroposophy;and to improve the teachers'professional practices. How Do Teachers Learn with Teachers? Understanding Child Study1as a Case for Professional Learning Communities Marisha Plotnik Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1 I56 \u00b7 How Do Teachers Learn with Teachers? munities in which I have participated: the Young Waldorf Colleagues Circle and the AdvancedStudies Initiative (ASI). In a letter to new ASI par-ticipants, McAlice describes the way in which thisgroup works: The way of working striven for in meetings of ASI memberscan be described as a focuseddialogical approach with adynamically evolving contentand structure. Teachers needto be able to engage oneanother in dialogues whichchallenge each to reach fromthe known through reflectedexperience into the unknown.This is a method of discoursewhich lies at the core ofSteiner's work on the creativesocial encounter. It rests uponthe three archetypal gesturesof the engaged self: focus, lis-tening, and speaking, and challenges partic-ipants to speak of rather than talk aboutthe topic at hand. In general, the dialoguesserve to lead all the participants to a deeperpedagogical understanding of the questionor topic being addressed, although not nec-essarily to answers to the questions orexplanations about the topics. The lattertend to move one to a cognitively safe dis-tance from the unknown, whereas the goalof this approach is to engage more closelywith the focus of attention. This sharedstriving to move towards rather than awayfrom a question or pedagogical riddle canlead to those rare moments of grace inwhich one has a deep consciously moralexperience of the inner nature of what onehas striven to understand. 8 The account that follows will describe what this process actually looks like in the Child StudyGroup, the kinds of structure that facilitate it, andmy reflections on the fruits of this endeavor. The Purpose of Child Study Our Child Study Group has these three purposes:to understand and better meet the needs of indi-vidual students in the school; to deepen the par-ticipants' understanding of anthroposophy; and toimprove the teachers' professional practices. Thesepurposes demonstrate a recognition that profes-sional learning communities need to balance process with content. 9As Lieberman and Miller describe in their third chapter, professional learning communi- ties need to study something\u2014the content. In our case, the content istwofold: the individual child, andthe philosophy of anthroposophy. The first purpose of our group, articulating how to meet the needsof individual students, is common tonearly every school. Whether welook to the committees that writeIndividual Educational Plans (IEPs)in a public school, an educationalsupport team in a private school, ora care group in many Waldorfschools, these groups devote them-selves to finding and describing howto better meet the needs of studentswho are perceived to be struggling in, or disturbing to, their classrooms. These groupsmay be described as providing diagnosis and pre-scription. A common assumption concerning theirwork, however, is one of expertise: Those who diag-nose and prescribe are qualified, and usually certi-fied, to do so. While it may be expected that theirskills will be honed by practice, there may be littleconscious effort to explicitly develop new skillswithin the committee's process of diagnosis andprescription. Child study is unusual in turning this assump- tion on its head. As we study a child, seeking tounderstand how to meet her needs, we are simulta-neously and consciously working to develop newskills and capacities as classroom teachers and ascolleagues. First-year teachers and experienced col-leagues work side-by-side, and insights can comefrom either. Expertise is judged during the processof work. Experienced teachers may more frequentlycontribute valuable questions or offer fruitfulinsights. It may also be, however, that an experi-enced teacher is more fixed in her opinions andmodes of seeing. Every teacher who joins the workof child study, therefore, must be simultaneouslycommitted to the children and to her own growth.This growth is necessarily both professional andpersonal. In the work of teaching out of anthropos-ophy, the first cannot be divorced from the second. As we study a child, seeking to under- stand how to meether needs, we aresimultaneously andconsciously workingto develop new skillsand capacities asclassroom teachersand as colleagues. Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1Since my first encounter with child study in 1995, when I arrived as a teacher new to the Rudolf Steiner School, I have seen the balancebetween providing for the needs of exceptionalstudents and providing professional growthchange in emphasis. My current emphasis for thegroup is toward masterful teaching. In particular,my interest lies in the interactive relationshipbetween the teacher and the students in his class,what I might call the art of teaching. As DavidSchon describes it, I have used the term professional artistry to refer to the kinds of competence practi-tioners sometimes display in unique,uncertain, and conflicted situations ofpractice. Note, however, that their artistryis a high-powered, esoteric variant of themore familiar sorts of competence all ofus exhibit every day in countless acts ofrecognition, judgment, and skillful per-formance. 10 In the classroom, I argue that \"unique\" and \"uncertain\" situations arise daily. A teacher's pro-fessional artistry lies in the ability to do the rightthing at the right time. When do you throw thelesson plan out the window and do exactly whatthe class needs at that moment? What do youchoose to do? Certainly, teachers may improvethrough trial and error, but that can be slow, frus-trating, and damaging to both teacher and stu-dents. Indeed, many teachers leave the professionlong before they become masterful, or rest contentat a certain level of competence. Child studyworks from the basic assumption that teacherscan consciously and deliberately develop skillsthat will enable professional artistry in their class-es. Master teachers have a wide variety of effec-tive styles, and artful teaching is highly individual.Our study thus avoids training in particular meth-ods or techniques. Rather, we educate ourselves incareful observation, disciplined reflection, andresponsible experimentation. The Process of Child Study Child Study has met every Thursday after- noon for more than twenty-five years. Meetingslast between about 60 and 90 minutes. Typically,they include an opening exercise, study of a text,work on the riddle of an individual child, and aclosing. Membership is entirely voluntary and isopen to any teacher or administrator in ourNursery-12 school, although the majority ofmembers have historically tended to be earlychildhood teachers. Every second week an anthro-posophical physician joins our work. Observation Our first step in studying a child is to observe that child as fully as we can. What is the physicalform of the child? Is he short for his age, or tall?Are his limbs rounded or linear? Have the second-ary teeth descended or are the milk teeth stillintact? What are the child's habits? Does she suckher thumb? Tap his foot? How does the childmove? Can he jump rope? Catch a ball? Walk abalance What is the child's speech like? Arethe sounds clear? Where are they placed in themouth? What does the child eat? Does she preferfoods that are white? Foods that are crunchy?How is the child's health? Are there allergies?Does the child tend to get headaches or stom-achaches? What is the character of the child'shandwriting? Is it angular or rounded? Are thepages messy or deliberate? Are the pencil strokeslight or do they make grooves in the paper? Theseare only a scant handful of the many, manyobservations that a teacher might make about achild of interest. Good observation is typically characterized as objective, and it is essential that the observer remain completely faithful to the truth. I havefound, however, that objective observation, ratherthan distancing me from the phenomenon athand, brings me increasingly closer to it. As ayoung teacher, struggling to work with a student Idisliked, I was advised simply to observe that stu-dent. Then, as now, I found that the more closely Iobserved, the more interested I became in the phe-nomenon. Each observation called for more obser-vations: whendid the child start staring out the window? How oftendid she drum her fingers on the desk? And, surprisingly, the more I observed,the more I found myself liking a formerly irritatingchild. Observation leads to interest which leads tosympathy. Experience can occur anywhere on aspectrum from fleeting and superficial to intenseand profound. An impoverished experience mustnecessarily allow only shallow reflection and Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1Marisha Plotnik \u00b7 57greater likelihood for an erroneous hypothesis. Because our work is in teaching children, ourhypotheses take on a deeply moral character. Because of this emphasis on observation, we spend some time during each child study meetingtraining ourselves to be better observers. This ishelped by our fifteen to twenty minutes each ses-sion working through an artis-tic exercise. Over the years,these have included sketching,speech work, eurythmy, andclay sculpture, rotating throughthis opening time in blocks ofabout twelve to sixteen weeks.Our intention is not to becomeartists, but rather to use eachmedium to sharpen our capaci-ty for observation. This timealso serves to center us, allow-ing us to slowly shed the busy-ness of the day and to slowdown, breathe, and fully arrivein the room. Our first step in studying a child is to have the presentingteacher simply describe thatchild to the group as complete-ly as she can while withholding further interpreta-tion as much as possible. This initial presentationtakes only ten to fifteen minutes, a long time forpure description. The other teachers listen asattentively as they can, working hard to form apicture of the child in their mind's eye. Then a fewminutes are given for the listeners to ask questionsthat fill out that picture, details that the presenteroverlooked. I typically schedule this presentationat the end of our agenda, so that we are nottempted to chat about the child, but we can closethe meeting with a picture of the child living inour imagination. Diagnosis One week later, Child Study returns again to thatsame child. During the week, every member hasmade an effort to observe the child for himself orherself, visiting classes or simply watching thechild play in the park. During this week, theschool's anthroposophical doctor is also in atten-dance, and by now he has observed the child ontwo separate days. We return to the child by recollecting her in our collective imagination. Taking turns aroundthe circle, each teacher mentions what \"struck\"her about the child, either from her own observa-tion or from her memory of the last week's pres-entation. At this point, other information may beintroduced: paintings, written compositions, edu- cational assessments, a house-tree-person picture. The present-ing teacher has also usually beenin contact with the child's par-ents, and anything the parentwishes to share about the child'searly years and home routines isnow brought to the group. Fromthis comprehensive description ofthe child, a question, or \"prob-lem\" may begin to emerge. Thequestion, we hope, suggests amore fundamental riddle in thechild's constitution. Beyondsuperficial problems of inappro-priate behavior or academicunderachievement, we try to dis-cern the imbalance or disjunctionin the picture of the child. Thewisdom of the practiced teachers is especially important at this stage, for while anovice can discipline herself to careful observa-tion, those observations do not always \"speak\" toher. This is the stage at which conceptual schemas enter, and we must proceed gently indeed. Alearning community needs a shared language. Butthe concepts expressed by that language must bedeeply penetrated and alive for each member inthe circle. Superficial frames and unexamined jar-gon have no place here. As McAlice describes it,our intention is to approach closer to the riddle athand rather than to distance ourselves by explain-ing it away. In the work of the Child Study, anexplanation serves to situate the question in sucha way that we can begin to make sense with it. Toward this end, a substantial portion of each meeting is spent in studying Rudolf Steiner'swork. For four years we have worked withFoundations of Human Experience (Study of Man). 11 We typically spend several weeks on each lecture,working through about seven lectures each year.Slow, ongoing, recur- sive work with Steiner'sideas jargon sothat unfamiliar part ofa deep, enduringunderstanding and ameaningful, sharedvocabulary. Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #158\u00b7 How Do Teachers Learn with Teachers?Our work with these lectures is by no means fin- ished, and I expect that we will return to themmany times in future years. This slow, ongoing,recursive work with Steiner's ideas enables us tomove beyond catch-phrases and jargon so thatunfamiliar words and difficult concepts slowlybecome part of a deep, enduring understandingand a meaningful, shared vocabulary. Our intention is to come to a place where we can speak \"out of\" rather than \"about\" the lectureat hand and toward that end we work slowly anddeliberately. Steiner's work is difficult, and itwould be easy to come to the table with a collec-tion of highlighted passages, ideas we don'tunderstand, or statements with which to agree ordisagree. What we have in mind, however, islearning that transforms us. Instead of merelybringing our current skills and capacities to ana-lyze the text at hand, we intend, through workingwith the text, to develop new skills and capacities.Rather like learning a new language, say Frenchor mathematics, exercise in reading that languagedevelops the language itself, as well as thethoughts contained within the language, thusbringing process and content as dual foci of ourwork. One of the exercises that I learned through my work with McAlice is to begin with a collectiveremembering of the text, thought by thought,without notes or book to glance at. Either pro-gressing in a sequential manner around the circle,or freely opening the floor to whoever wishes tovolunteer, we try to simply summarize thethoughts of the lecture in the order in which theywere given. This is a remarkable challenge notonly as a memory and concentration exercise, butas a social exercise in listening and speaking. Asthe participants in the group speak, they buildtogether a picture that everyone recognizes andyet one that looks different from what anyonealone would have created. Something shared isbrought into existence, and from that shared co-creation a different level of dialogue may emerge. With Steiner's concepts at the heart of our shared vocabulary, we offer explanations thatremain tentative and malleable. Thoughts oftenemerge in the form of images or metaphors aboutthe child, and they can have an almost dream-likequality. Occasionally, one of these speaks of thechild with profound power and truthfulness. It isthese insights for which we strive, which McAlicecalls \"those rare moments of grace in which onehas a deep, consciously moral experience of theinner nature of what one has striven to under-stand.\" 12 Treatment This stage, a natural evolution of the previousone, sees that the dream-like image we had of thechild holds up to the light of day. McAlice's \"expe-rience of the inner nature\" needs to be articulated.Insights are formed into words. We search to seewhere this image fits with our observations of thechild, and where it does not. Finally, this newunderstanding of the child is translated into a rec-ommended course of action. This may consist ofapparently small changes in how the teachermeets the child in the classroom, or it may involvesubstantial changes to the child's educational pro-gram, perhaps requiring the agreement of manyteachers within the school. The presenting teacherimplements the proposed course of action andreports to the Child Study six weeks later andagain at the end of the year. Occasionally there isa dramatic change in the child, usually there aresubtle changes, and sometimes there is littlechange at all. Conclusion Reflecting upon my work with the child study, Iam brought back to the helpful idea of essential tensions. 13To reiterate my earlier description, this concept recognizes apparent dichotomies within acollaborative enterprise that, when brought intorelationship which each other, generate growth.When the relationship lacks a healthy dynamic,however, these are exactly the fault lines alongwhich collaboration can be split asunder andwhich therefore cause an enterprise to fail. The first tension I have found is that between keeping the group voluntary and maintaining theconsistency\u2014and depth\u2014of the work. A remark-able circumstance of this particular learning com-munity is its voluntary nature. There are fewextrinsic motivators for teachers to attend.Teachers are there because they wish to be thereand they consider that this commitment of timeand effort yields some real benefit to them. Thiscreates the ideal atmosphere of working with peo-ple who want to work. It also means that atten-dance may be dropped whenever the intensity of Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1Marisha Plotnik \u00b7 59Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1allow profound conversation to occur while enabling newcomers to understand, and con-tribute to, increasingly more of that conversation.It is essential that neither group be allowed todominate the conversation and to find ways todemand and recognize some participation ofevery member. Every teacher is able to observechildren, however elementary those initial obser-vations may be, and every teacher can participatein some way in text-based exercises. These areways to begin. Ideally, the collaborative is able toarrive at the place described by Grossman et al.where teachers take responsibility for each other'slearning. In this dimension, that includes the insid-ers encouraging the newcomers, and the newcom-ers recognizing when to hold their skepticism inabeyance. Community is hard work. Intentional commu- nity is harder still. Nevertheless, my own experi-ences in professional learning communities havemade me resolutely optimistic about their poten-tial for transforming the nature of teaching andlearning.the rest of the week becomes too great. Thismeans that, in any given week, the size of thegroup can vary between five and seventeen partic-ipants. Inconsistent attendance means that thework cannot build and deepen, and those whoattend regularly may grow irritated. I have foundthat it takes devotion and patience to maintain anopen and welcoming gesture of freedom while atthe same time expecting higher levels of workfrom the group. Ultimately, however, I believe thatthis uncomfortable tension generates a deeperlevel of engagement from those who are able tobring it. The second tension is between helping the child and furthering our own self-development asteachers. As a younger teacher, I was impatientwith the time we \"wasted\" reading Steiner's texts,and I was eager to spend more time talking aboutchildren. The texts were so difficult and theirmeaning so esoteric that I was able to find littlethat was \"practical\" or \"useful\" in understandinghow to work with a living, breathing problem inmy second period class. Over the years, I haveincreasingly come to appreciate the study. Now, Irecognize that I cannot create meaningful changein the way a child behaves in my class withoutprofoundly changing myself in relationship to thatchild. My experience of wrestling with Steiner'sideas changes me. I recognize, however, that dif-ferent members of the group ascribe differentweights to \"study\" and \"child,\" and I believe thatthis essential tension is indeed generative. Themore deeply we study children the more profound-ly we change ourselves, which enables us to meetchildren in a new way with new capacities forstudying them. We need the different members ofthe collaborative to pull our work first deeply inone direction and then deeply in the other so that,through our dialogue, something new emerges. The third tension is between what I will call the \"insiders\" and the \"newcomers.\" Some partici-pants have been engaged with Steiner's work for more than twenty-five years while others areencountering anthroposophy for the first time.Those with deep familiarity may be frustrated ifthey feel that they need to speak at an introductory level and that dialogue hinders a deeper examina-tion of the ideas. Newcomers are equally frustrat-ed if they find themselves unable to understandwhat the insiders are saying. It is difficult work to60\u00b7 How Do Teachers Learn with Teachers?Endnotes 1. Editor's note: The term \"child study\" describes an international movement, linked to the birth of developmental psychology, of the late 19th andearly 20th centuries in Germany and the UnitedStates, in particular. In Germany, Wilhelm Preyer'sDie Seele des Kindes (1882; translated as The Mind of a Child) stands as the first published research in child development. In the U.S., in the 1880s, G.S.Hall of Clark University\u2014who later introduced theconcept of \"adolescence\" to discussions of childpsychology\u2014introduced child development thebiological idea recapitulation (\"ontogeny recapit-ulates phylogeny\"\u2014the development of one indi-vidual recapitulates the development of the speciesor type). These developments contributed to anenthusiastic \"child study movement\" and, in theU.S., the formation of the Child Study Associationof America (CSAA). A typical publication of thetime is Benjamin Gruenberg's Outlines of Child Study: A Manual for Parents and Teachers, published in1922. The CSAA also published a journal, Child Study, from the 1920s until 1960. Between 1960and the 1980s, the CSAA gradually dissolved, andit exists no longer. All of this occurred in the period during which Rudolf Steiner introduced his educational ideas tothe world and during which the first Waldorfschools were founded. Early Waldorf school educa-tors, following Steiner, therefore naturally adoptedportions of the then-contemporary discourse oneducation, including the term and concept of childstudy. The term is now somewhat archaic. It is in this context that Waldorf educators should see the use of the term \"child study.\" Theydo well to remember and acknowledge its roots,and even to consider adopting a less archaic formu-lation to describe their work. 2.

To balance on one foot, without their knees touching, and in stillness, with both armsextended out to their sides while theycount backward without losing their bal-ance. To stand on one foot, with arms stretched out in front of them, palms facing up, withboth eyes closed for 10 seconds withoutfalling. To reproduce patterns of abstract lines and curves (e.g., various geometric shapes,numbers, or letters) on a piece of paperwith a pencil when someone else drawsthese shapes, numbers or letters on theirbacks. To walk slowly on a balance beam, skip, and jump rope. If children can't do these tasks easily then they haven't integrated their vestibular and pro-prioceptive (sensory-motor) systems, and they willhave difficulty sitting still, listening, focusing theireyes, focusing their attention, and rememberingnumbers and letters in the classroom. Childrenintegrate their sensory-motor system throughbody movements and not through flash cards orplaying electronic games.

In contrast,watching television or videos and playing comput-have great concerns about teaching preschool and kindergarten children to read and write.Developmentally and neurologically it doesn't makesense. There is a developmental progression ofsensory-motor skills that a young child needs tomaster in the first seven years of life. Despite whatwe think, learning is not \"all from our head.\" Themovements of our body in utero, through infancyand childhood, and even in adulthood form the neu-ral pathways in our mind that we later use to read,write, spell, do math, and think in an imaginativeand creative way. I see countless numbers of chil-dren in my practice who have been diagnosed with\"ADD\" or \"learning disabilities\" who miraculouslyimprove when they are taken out of an \"academic\"kindergarten or given an extra year in a develop-mental kindergarten that emphasizes movementand the integration of their sensory-motor systems. My years of experience as a developmental and behavioral pediatrician have shown me that chil-dren who have difficulties reading and writing usu-ally have a poorly developed sense of balance, havedifficulty making eye contact, have difficulty track-ing or following with their eyes, can't easily distin-guish the right side of the body from the left, havedifficulty sitting still in a chair, and have difficultylocating their bodies in space. Many of these chil-dren who have difficulties reading and writing alsohave poor muscle tone, exemplified by a slumpedposture, a tense or fisted pencil grip, and \"flat feet\"(collapsed arches). Sometimes these children areoverly sensitive to touch and have difficulties intheir peer relationships because they are using theirminds and eyes to help their bodies navigate inspace and thus they miss social, non-verbal cuesfrom their playmates. These children also have anoveractive sympathetic nervous system (\"fight orflight\" reaction) and are therefore extra-sensitive tothe stimulant effects of sugar, chocolate, lack ofsleep, changes in routines, television, and playingvideo and computer games. Children who are ready to read and write should be able to accomplish these tasks: Does Our Educational System Contribute to Attentional and Learning Difficulties in Our Children? Susan R. Johnson, MD, F AAP Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1 I64 \u00b7 Does Our Educational System Contribute to Attentional and Learning Difficulties in Our Children? Research Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1er games are extremely poor sources of stimula- tion for their sensory-motor development andactually prevent the integration of their nervoussystems by keeping children in a state of stress,and activating their sympathetic nervous systems,their \"fight or flight\" response. Finally, the ability to print and match a par- ticular sound to a specific letter (phonics) in chil-dren is predominately a left-sided (analytic) brainactivity. Developmentally, the left side of the braindoesn't fully start to develop or myelinate untilages 7 to 9 years (this is especially true for boys).When we teach children to read or write at anearlier age, we stress their minds and their bodiesand force them to use only the right side of theirbrains for reading (sight memory). The right brainis more intuitive and looks at the whole picturerather than at details, so the child usually looksonly at the first and last letter and the length of aword and then makes a guess at what the wordmight be, without sounding it out. Some childrencan easily switch from the right hemisphere to theleft as they get older, but many children (especial-ly the ones who can't skip) haven't developed thepathway (corpus callosum) to quickly travel fromthe right side of the brain to the left side; theseare then stuck trying to read and spell with theright hemisphere. These children often write let-ters backward, can't spell, and can't seem toremember which sounds go with which letters.The effort required to write is also tremendous. Our American diet, which is high in simple sugars, high in partially hydrogenated (\"bad\")fats, and low in omega 3 fatty acids, contributesto our current epidemic in attentional and learn-ing problems, and I wonder if much of our currentepidemic also comes from our children watchingtoo much television, playing too many videogames, spending too much time in front of a com-puter screen, and being pushed to read and writetoo early. We need to surround young children with what I call the \"Buddha\" state. This is regulatedby the parasympathetic nervous system, which isbest supported by adequate sleep, predictablerhythms and routines, wholesome nutrition,warmth, harmonious non-competitive rhythmicmovements, and most importantly, our love.Children's brains develop and integrate when theyare in the \"Buddha\" state. Their brains can't fullyintegrate or develop when they are in a state ofstress or in survival mode, i.e. \"fight or flight.\" I support, therefore, preschools and kinder- gartens that emphasize healthy movements, pro-mote daily living skills (e.g., sweeping and stir-ring), as well as encourage creative \"pretend\"play. If preschools and kindergartens, and thegovernment laws that set the standards for edu-cation, can support these healthy activities andstop trying to teach our young children to readand write, then I believe we will start to seehealthier 8 and 9 year olds who can listen, focus,sit still, write, read, pay attention, and learn withease. -------------------- Susan R.

On the basis of which values do currentWaldorf school trustees, and therefore theirboards, operate? In our role as directors of theWaldorf Administration Program, we focus ourcurriculum on those approaches that supportWaldorf pedagogy and that are consistent withanthroposophy. While we seek to display to thestudents as wide a set of methods of articulatingthose values as possible, it is up to students tointerpret the values for themselves and integratethem into their work environments. We summarize survey responses below, and, based on these responses, we offer some recom-mendations. The Survey We asked seven questions, six of them endingwith an open-ended comment section, whichyielded a number of specific responses. 1. What position(s) do you hold, have you held, or do you expect shortly to hold? 2. Indicate the level of your prior experience with nonprofit trusteeship. 3. Indicate any reading, studying, or training you personally have done on nonprofit trusteeship. 4. Indicate what familiarity you have with authors or methods of nonprofit trusteeship. 5. Share your opinions about your current board effectiveness. 6. Describe the practices of your board.7. Please indicate what affects board decision- making. To conduct the survey we distributed a link to Survey Monkey, a web-based survey service, viaemail. We sent four different messages over eightweeks in an effort to gain as much participationas possible. In the end we received 120 responses.Background Over the past 15 years a heightened degree of interest has been devoted to Waldorf schoolorganizational life, and deservedly so. This inter-est has prompted a widening circle of Waldorfschools to recognize the need for greater profes-sionalism and a spiritual approach to administra-tion. At the same time, many have expressed theidea that school boards of trustees have receivedinsufficient attention. Questions of board func-tion--including the delicate issue of what to dowhen boards don't function well--are a lingeringsource of puzzlement and frustration. We hopethat our research will contribute to a betterunderstanding of Waldorf school boards and helpto raise the level of discussion of questions ofboard function. As directors of a training program focused on the organizational life of Waldorf schools, weappreciate the passion and desire for improve-ment that has driven discussions about trustee-ship. It is our observation, however, that many ofthe sometimes divergent views about trusteeshiphave been fueled more by opinion than by data.As a result of these observations we decided tocreate a survey focused on trustee education. Why trustee education? We believe that the window through which we query colleaguesabout trusteeship shapes the direction of conver-sation, so we gave considerable thought to howbest to approach questions of trusteeship. It is ourview that the quality and depth of the educationthat individual trustees bring to their task, orreceive during their tenure, supports or limitswhat they can achieve collectively as a board. Aseducators, we are interested in exploring whatkind of education Waldorf school boards providefor their trustees, what education trustees providefor themselves, how that education is obtained,and whether or not trustees believe they arebeing well-equipped to serve their school commu-nities. Survey on Waldorf School Trustee Education Martin Novom and Jean Yeager Responses 1. What views and opinions do trustees (and oth ers) have about trusteeship? The respondents, mostly trustees, but also some parents, teachers, and administrators who are not trustees, say that, for the most part, theyare satisfied with the general level of practice andbehavior of their boards. Many say, however, thatthey are not adequately serving their school, atleast in part because the awareness, understand-ing, and study of Waldorf pedagogy and anthro-posophy are insufficient. 2. What level of experience is there on Waldorf school boards? Slightly more than 50% have two to seven years' experience. Fewer than 30% have seven ormore years' experience as a trustee. In chairingboard committees, levels are similar: 30% havechaired a committee, 28% have chaired a com-mittee two or three times, and 19% have chaireda committee four times or more. 48% have servedas board president, but only 20% have served aspresident two or more times. We believe that, given the relatively few years of experience, the fact that trustees generallymeet infrequently compared to faculty groups hasimplications for the potential quality of perform-ance. 3. What kinds of preparation have trustees and boards undertaken in order to perform their tasks? As individuals, sources for trustee preparation include, in descending order: books, magazines orjournals, pamphlets, webseminars, and DVDs orvideos. For boards as a whole, also in descendingorder, these include: workshop sessions, all-dayworkshops, multi-day workshops, and trainingprograms. More important than the order of these choic- es is the frequency of usage of these sources. Thegreatest number, only 41%, report some readingin magazines or journals. Given the relative lack ofprior experience, this is troubling. For the fullboard, things are not much better. Here the great-est number, 37%, report they have done a smallnumber of workshop sessions. Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2010\u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1We asked the open-ended question: \"Describe the kind of reading, studying, or training YOURBOARD engages in.\" The wide variety of respons-es indicates that many boards are doing some-thing. Are they, however, doing enough? Andwhat type or quality of education are they under-taking? One way we sought to gauge this was to ask respondents: \"What authors or methods oftrusteeship are you familiar with?\" We selected sixauthors or methods of trusteeship that are, in ouropinion, most widely read and recommended, andthat have the highest profile in the contemporarynonprofit arena. The highest percentages reportedpoint to the marginal effort trustees are making togain knowledge and understanding. Only 19%had \"heard of but only barely\" John Carver andhis Policy Governance method. In the higherranked \"have read some\" category, the numbersare similar\u201417% for Robert Greenleaf and hisservant leadership approach, and 19% for Carver.These are startlingly low levels of awareness orfamiliarity with writers who offer the fundamen-tals of the discipline of trusteeship. Waldorf trustees face their task with low lev- els of prior experience and, as individuals and col-lectively as boards, they make only a nominaleffort to prepare for and advance their perform-ance on the job. This should be a concern for theWaldorf school movement and for boards oftrustees themselves. 4. How well do boards perform? Trustee selection, trustee orientation, cultiva- tion of skills, and officer succession report thelowest performance levels, with two thirds ormore ranking their performance as \"Barely pass-able to Moderate.\" Things improve in the areas of clarity of board's role, clarity or cultivation of board'svision, effectiveness of committees, transparencyof nominating process, and willingness to partici-pate in charitable giving. Here a solid two thirdsor more report \"Moderate to Very good.\" Even better are the ratings for quality of board meetings and board-wide commitment toparticipate in board activities, where about twothirds report \"Very good to Well done.\" 66 \u00b7 Survey on Waldorf School Trustee Education The lowest ratings are reported in connection with the areas of anthroposophical study and Waldorf education study, with about 25% rank-ing these \"Extremely poor.\" This contrasts withthe areas of interaction with administration andquality of meaningful discussion, which greaterthan 25% report as \"Well done.\" In the areas of interaction with administra- tion, sticking to the agenda, quality of listening,and quality of meaningful discussion, the ratingcategory of \"Very good\" received responses in therange of 50 to 65%. The areas of meetings start-ing and ending on time, inclusiveness of diverseviews, interaction with faculty, and quality offacilitation received a lower rating, with a rangeof 39 to 50% \"Very good.\" We also asked: \"Out of which set of values do Boards of Trustees want their trustees, and there-fore their boards, to be operating?\" Here, 54%report that the role of Waldorf values is\"Extremely important\" and 46% say that the roleof anthroposophy is \"important\" in guiding deci-sions and discussions. These responses present astrong contrast with the fact that a lower number,36%, believe that trustees being on a path of self-knowledge is \"important.\" Our perception is that, overall, trustees try hard and bring good intentions and vitality totheir boards. By their own measure, however, theyare significantly underperforming in the areas ofdefining and cultivating leadership, and integrat-ing Waldorf education and anthroposophical con-cepts. Conclusion Waldorf school trustees around the continent view their boards as performing moderately wellwith regard to the technical competencies ofdetails such as running meetings and reachingdecisions. Beyond these, however, performancesuffers. First, there is tension between trustees' lack of experience and the relative lack of effort that theyexpend to gain needed knowledge and skills.Boards of trustees can make clear improvementsby improving member selection and orientationand planning for succession. Second, there is tension between the view that knowledge and understanding of Waldorfpedagogy, values, and anthroposophy are impor-tant and the lack of commitment that trusteesand boards report to gain this knowledge andunderstanding. Third, there is tension between the acknowl- edged importance of school boards and our com-mitment to provide the training and support thattrustees need. Fortunately, we are not without resources. We have a body of knowledge, aligned and consistentwith Waldorf pedagogy, that can point us in thedirection to develop and create a curriculum forWaldorf trustees. We can look to the many lec-tures that Rudolf Steiner gave on social develop-ment. These are widely studied, for example, inthe Camphill movement. In addition, we can findcontemporary concepts and philosophies oftrustee practice that are consistent with ananthroposophical approach to trusteeship. These,too, need to be a part of trustee education. Values are not just what we say we believe. They are also expressed in what we do. One solu-tion to the tensions outlined above and illuminat-ed by our survey is to gather the resources neces-sary to develop and direct affordable, flexible, andgeographically diverse training and education forWaldorf trustees. -------------------- Martin L.

Knowing the names of stars is not like knowing how to play the piano or like knowing how to offer solace to someone in pain. Like intelligence, which we used to believe was one thing\u2014measured on an IQ test, for example\u2014knowledge comes indifferent forms. We can know in different ways. Waldorf and Steiner schools emphasize threeways of knowing, the development of each corresponding roughly with preschool, ele men-tary school, and high school. Michael Polanyi called a first kind of knowing \"tacit knowing,\" knowing \"more than we can say.\" We can \"know\" how to cut a carrot, or the taste of the soup it makes, or how toplay the viola, or how to solve a problem in geome try. We can describe these things in lan-guage, but the value, meaning, and even truth of these knowledges\u2014cutting, tasting, play-ing, solving\u2014does not translate into language. It becomes apparent only when we do thesethings ourselves. Without the experience of doing, knowing has little meaning. Hence, inWaldorf schools, the importance of \"doing\" in preschool, before we emphasize other forms ofknowing. A second kind of knowing is aesthetic knowing. Its value is apparent in con trast to our concept of something that is anaesthetic, or numbing. Aesthetic knowing is alive, awake, andsensitive. It is knowing in heart and gut (yes, the brain plays its role, but we feel our feelingsin our hearts and lungs and guts). It is intuitive, \"taught from within.\" It is a form of knowingespecially valuable for artists, musicians, clinical psychologists, and even advertising copy-writers. It is a form of knowing that connects us powerfully to the world. It develops in chil-dren most readily when they have separated from their parents and begin to comprehend theworld around them for themselves. Hence, in Waldorf schools, the importance of beauty andfeeling in the elementary school. A third kind of knowing is knowing through thinking. By thinking, however, I mean a par- ticular kind of thinking that attempts in Henri Bortoft's phrase to \"swim upstream,\" reversingfragmentation, categorization, and specialization in order to recover wholeness. Thinking log-ically with given postulates, think ing algorithmically, is \"downstream\" thinking, the outcomedetermined by the input. It is powerful but dead. Synthetic, living thinking can encompass orembrace analysis, logic, and critical thinking. It seeks to go beyond them to recover or reachthe origin of creative thought and imagination. It develops in students who are wrestling notso much with the world around them as with their own identities in that world. Hence, inWaldorf schools, the impor tance in high school of the develop ment of thinking. These three ways of knowing are cumulative and integrative. We do not leave one for the next, but build on what comes before. As adults, our thinking is enriched if we also know howto do and to feel. All three forms of knowing are present earlier too; young children learningto walk and talk (two of the most important forms of doing) can also feel and think. Byemphasizing one way of knowing at the appropriate time, allowing other ways to developsimultaneously but sleepily, we work in accordance with children's growth away from theirparents and into the world and themselves. - Stephen Keith SagarinResearch Bulletin \u00b7 Spring 2010 \u00b7 Volume 15 \u00b7 #1News from the Online Waldorf Library Marianne Alsop The Online Waldorf Library provides information and resources to all who are interested in Waldorf education.
